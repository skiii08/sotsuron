Ford v Ferrari," A Most Complete and Well Told Racing Strry
","This is based upon a true storyIn the 1960s, Ford wanted to merge with Farrari, but that didn't happen. Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to get some revenge on Farrari (whose cars dominate the La Mans race in France) now wants to build a race car to beat Farrari in the Le Mans 24 Hour endurance race. Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) is contacted to build that race car. Shelby did win the LeMans race, but health reasons now keep him from racing. He is also a car designer. Shelby's best driver and racing engineer is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and both he and Shelby build that car, a GT40 Mk 1 high performance racing car.This is a very complete racing story, and probably one of the best ever. Of course, politics enter into this and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) the Head of Ford Racing wants his own drivers to do the racing and not Ken Miles who Beebe feels is not Ford quality material. Shelby has no choice in this until Ford loses some races and he confronts Henry Ford II and gets his way. Or so we think as that almost changes later on too, but Shelby makes a very high risk bet with Henry Ford II in order to get his way.The first meeting scene with Carroll Shelby and Henry Ford II is pure gold. Listen carefully.We see a lot of very fast racing and - to be honest - a lot of this racing rivals the racing in some of the Fast and Furious movies. Kudos. Keep in mind the editing is a very big part of any racing movie and the editing here is spot on. More Kudos.We also see the introduction of the Ford Mustang in 1964. It really wasn't talked about or even mentioned, but Lee Iacocca was the person that put Ford in the minds of young drivers who were the sons of World War II vets and this went a long way improving sales to rival Chevrolet.Notables: Catherine Baife as Mollie Miles, Ken Mile's wife; Noah Jupe as Peter Miles, son of Ken and Mollie; Ray McKinnon as Phil Remington, Shelby's Sales/ Auto Manager; Remo Girone as Enzo Farrari, Joe Bernthal as Lee Iacocca.A very good scene is when Ken punches Shelby who is trying to apologize for not taking Ken to France the first time because Leo Beeble wanted his drivers and not Ken. After the punch Shelby counters and they go at it until they become so tired they just rest there fully exhausted. All this time Mollie was watching the fight and goes into the house and gets both a cold drink.All in all a very enjoyable and complete racing story. The movie was nominated for Best Picture. It did receive the Oscar for Best Film Editing (told ya) and for Best Sound Editing.Stay tuned at the end to see what happened to Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles. (9/10)Violence: No.

First Man," A Very Somber Movie
","This is a true storyAstronaut Neil Armstrong's (Ryan Gosling) journey to become the first man to walk on the Moon is a very somber journey. I say this because the death of his young daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford) played heavily on his mind in everything he did. This is my take on the movie.One would think that going to the Moon, there would be cause for celebration with excitement reigning every where. The Space Program has had its problems and setbacks. Many brave Astronauts died in the exercises practicing to go to the Moon. Armstrong did say something like: it's better that we fail down here and not up there.Think about it. Going to the Moon is like achieving another Wonder of the World. This movie had Ryan Gosling play a very somber, quiet role because that was the way Neil Armstrong was and I still maintain that his daughter's death made him turn to his astronaut work and not so much to his family. His wife Janet (Claire Foy) had to really talk to him to get him to talk to his sons with the possibility of his not returning. He struggled with this talk.When he was on the Moon he tossed Karen's bracelet into a crater. In his mind Karen will always be with him on the Moon or something like that. She was always on his mind.Notables: Kyle Chandler as Deke Slayton, Dir of Flight Operations; Cory Stoll as Buzz Aldrin, who also walked on the Moon with Neil; Ethan Embrey as Mike Collins, the Astronaut who remained in the capsule above the Moon when Neil and Buzz walked on the Moon; Jason Clarke as Astronaut Ed White, who died in a fire before a launch; Shea Whigham as Gus Grissom who also died in that fire before a launch;There are too many dark scenes when they didn't have to be; jumpy camera work that became annoying at times; too many shots of capsule dials; no one stood out as a leader in a venture that would change the world and not just the Space Program. Again, a very somber movie. Serious, yes, but very somber.When Neil Armstrong returned from the Moon there were no scenes of being splashed down in the ocean and celebrations worldwide. A few interviews shown didn't really count in here.When Janet visited Neil when he was quarantined, I got the feeling that she was gong to tell Neil she was going to divorce him. That was a very uncomfortable and somber scene too. I didn't see much love in that room.This movie should have been a celebration after everyone's hard work, but that didn't happen.

A Star Is Born," A Good Movie
","Jackson -aka Jack- Maine (Bradley Cooper) a popular rock star takes Ally (Lady Gaga) a waitress and singer in a Drag Bar to accompany him on stage and basically this is where a star is born. The song sung by both of them in this opening was the best song in the film. Very enjoyable. I mention this because the rest of the songs in the movie were not as good, no real hooks which is to say the melodies were not there, and, at times, it was hard to understand the lyrics. Oh, and sometimes the songs went the distance and we heard the whole piece. Not enjoyable. Song selection wasn't good.We see Ally's star rise and Jack's star diminish as he is way into alcohol and drugs, and he has a case of tinnitus. The chemistry between Jack and Ally is quite good and one would think there is something here worth preserving and leaving the egos behind. Doesn't happen that way.Oscar-wise, there is much talk about this movie. I would award the Best Actor Oscar to Bradley Cooper as he has done probably his best work ever. Lady Gaga was okay, but needs some acting help if she is to continue in the acting business. And generally, I am not smitten with her singing. Bradley Cooper directed this movie and did pretty good and we know this because we have long been told that to act in and direct the movie is not an easy task. In here Cooper's directing and his acting went smoothly and who knows maybe he'll get an Oscar for directing. That's okay.Notables: Sam Elliott as Bobby, Jack's older brother, who works for Jack; Dave Chappelle as George Stone who tries to give Jack sound advice that Jack ignores as he is too restless to settle in one place; Andrew Dice Clay as Ally's father, Lorenzo; Anthony Ramos as Ramon, Ally's close friend; Ron Rifkin as Carl who talks to Jack about his tinnitus; Rafi Gavron as Ramon, Ally's manager who changes her look and he tells Jack to get his act together because he is tired of cleaning up his mess; Greg Grunberg as Phil, Jack's driver.All in all this is a good movie, but not an Oscar worthy movie although Bradley Cooper deserves Oscar for Best Actor (7/10)Violence: Not really.

Captain Marvel," Very Enjoyable
","After finally discovering who she is Vers/ Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) knows what her mission is when two Alien forces go to war.I was ready to shut this down within 10-minutes because no one could tell what was going on. We see loads of CGI battles, some banter between Vers (yes, that's Brie Larson, too) and Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) and also with Vers and Supreme Intelligence (Annette Bening), and very darkened scenes as well and we still had no idea what was going on.The movie that we will come to understand is when Vers lands on planet C-53, that's Earth. Now, as we go along, we will begin to understand all that confusion we saw in the first 10-minutes. So hang in there, it's quite good. It's a good story as Carol begins to piece together her life and who she was and who she is now when for 6-years everyone thought Carol died in that crash with Dr. Lawson (Annette Bening).What are the Kree after? They are after a core energy source to control the entire universe. When Carol shoots at the engine she believes is the core energy source (in the plane she and Dr. Lawson were in) there is a power surge into Carol's body and that is where her powers come from.Notables: Samuel L. Jackson as Shield Agent, Fury and he believes Carol is a good guy and becomes her side-kick so to speak; Clark Gregg as Shield Agent Phil Coulson; Ben Mendelsohn as Talos who convinces Carol she is on the wrong side; Lashana Lynch as Maria Rambeay, a friend and fellow test pilot back in the day before Carol crashed; Annette Bening plays a bad person as Supreme Intelligence and a good one as Dr. Wendy Lawson; (yes, this can get confusing); Lee Pace as Ronan, a Kree soldier under Yon-Rogg; Djimon Hounsou as Korath a Kree warrior under Yon-Rogg.We do see Stan Lee as Stan Lee as a passenger on a train. The music was very, very good all the way through.Now, here's the thing. At no time was Carol Danvers referred to as Captain Marvel, and you now know where her powers came from so there was no Shazam. See? Billy Batson and his Shazam remain safe. Carol will come to be known as Captain Marvel or as MAR VEL as Carol recalled the real name of Dr. Lawson...... maybe. After the credits run we will see a scene for a sequel to this movie, and then there is a statement that says Captain Marvel will also be in AVENGERS ENDGAME. Can't wait.So this was very enjoyable and I am glad I didn't shut it down. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: Yes, quite a few good lines. Language: Brief small stuff.

Knives Out," Quite Enjoyable and Satisfying
","Private Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by someone (he doesn't know who hired him) to solve the murder of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer)who just had his 85th Birthday. Blanc must sift through lies, mis-truths, and outright deception to discover the truth. The whole family is assembled for the investigation by Blanc to determine who killed Harlan, but most are concerned how much they will get when the WILL is read.This is a loooong movie but it goes by so fast you don't really notice. And get this: when the Lawyer Frank Oz (Alan Stevens) reads the WILL, it is here a whole new story starts and you don' mind one bit because now it really gets interesting. You'll see.I got a kick out of Daniel Craig's Southern Accent. Finally we see some good acting by the one who plays Bond, James Bond, and he did great. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Twist? You want a twist? You got it. There are a couple and no you won't see them coming. No one did. You know how Harlan Thrombey dies, but Det Benoit Blanc needs to figure out all the steps involved, which reminded me of the old Charlie Chan (or Agatha Christi) movies back in the day, but here there is no number 1, or 2 son to rely on/ blame for not recognizing clues. Just a thought.The key to everything is Marta, Harlan's nurse, played by the most beautiful Ana de Armas. You will know what she knows, but there is much more to know that she doesn't know. You'll see. Oh, the one thing about Marta that you will come to know early: when she doesn't tell the truth, she vomits.Notables: Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale, Thrombey's daughter; Don Johnson as Richard, husband of Linda; Michael Shannon as Walt Thronbey, son of Harlan, but who also runs Harlan's publishing company; Chris Evans as Richard's son Ranson who knows he was cut out of the WILL; Toni Collette as Joni daughter of Harlan; LaKeith Stanfeld as Lieutenant Elliott; K. Callan as Greatnana Wanetta, Harlan's mother; M. Emmet Walsh as Mr Proofec, Thrombey's head of Security.This is a very satisfying movie and when it does end, you will wish it didn't. You'll see.

Aquaman," Long Live Atlantis
","Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is told that he is the only one who can bring the two worlds of land and sea together and he must do it as King. Arthur says he is no king and has no desire to be so. Princess Mera (Amber Heard) tells him he must do this because his half brother King Orm (Patrick Wilson) says it's time for the sea to claim the land and scorch the whole Earth. The only way Aquaman can do all this is with the Trident that the first King of Atlantis used and is most powerful. Aquaman believes the Trident is fiction. In time, Aquaman agrees to this mission, but first he must beat David Kane (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) who wants revenge on Aquaman because he killed his father Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) in the submarine when they as pirates tried to overtake the sub.The story opens with Arthur's father Thomas Curry (Temeura Morrison) who finds an unconscious Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), who is the Queen of Atlantis and they fall in love and they have Arthur in time. She leaves him to protect Arthur and she must return to Atlantis to save him. She vows to return to Thomas.The rest of the movie has Aquaman and Mera going here and there worldwide looking for clues to where the Trident is. He does have a battle with his half brother, King Orm, but Mera helps him escape.The CGI is absolutely unbelievable and you'd swear you are seeing things for real. Yes, some of the CGI scenes do go on for a little too long, but they are mesmerizing and really, really good. And Director James Wan must be given tons of kudos for this absolutely great production. He may get an Oscar for his work. The acting all around is spot on. The cinematography is excellent.Notables: Willam Dafoe as Vulko a counselor to the King of Atlantis and he claims to know where the Trident is; Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus who King Orm wants an alliance with; Amber Heard as Princess Mera is also the daughter of King Nereus; Kaan Guldur as 9-yr old Arthur and the big shark in the aquarium sees Mike (Jack Andrew) bully Arthur and bangs against the glass enclosure until Arthur puts his hands up to tell the shark to stop; Otis Dhanji as 13-yr old Arthur being taught Warrior techniques by Vulko; Julie Andrews as Karathan the Voice of a giant monster that guards the Trident and tells Arthur that only the real king can extract the Trident.I did not recognize Nicole Kidman when she first appeared as Queen Atlanna as she has this amazing ability to transform herself into a more beautiful woman. Kudos. The music is excellent. Watch carefully and you will see an Octopus on the many drums. Ha!When the credits run the first time, stay and you will see that David Kane (from the sub, remember?) is still alive and wants to know who Aquaman is and this will lead us into sequels. Ready?

Parzival In Virtual Reality (Ty Sheridan) or Wade in real life (also Tye Sherdan) enters the Oasis often, but now there is a new wrinkle: the creator of the Oasis Anorak/James Halliday (Mark Rylance) has died and has left a legacy and has left clues to 3-Keys or as he called them, an Easter Egg, and the one who finds the 3-Keys will inherit all he owned in life and will gain control of the Oasis. Wade decides to find those keys and win. There is simply too much CGI in here and after a while, it put me into la-la land. The story bounces back and forth between real life and the Oasis with Virtual Reality. And, truth be told someone liked playing with the CGI buttons too much and we find ourselves watching everything in the Oasis for way too long. And all became quite boring for me. Yes, the CGI is fantastic, no doubt about it, but when it goes on for too long I find myself dozing off. The story could have been cut back some, but like I said someone liked playing with the CGI buttons and I dozed off many times. Not good. There is a love interest for Wade/Parzival and that is Art3mis in VR (Olivia Cooke) and Samantha (also Olivia Cooke) in real life and she is also into finding those keys. Am glad I was awake when Parzival and Art3mis danced to the music of 'Staying Alive' Very nice.

It just went on for too long especially with too much background info between Parzival and Art3mis. This was a CGI-Fest and there was too much of it.

Bohemian Rhapsody," A Tremendous Tribute to Freddie Mercury
","The rise and fall of Freddie Mercury (Rami Malek) a Super Rock Star with his band: Queen.I have no knowledge of Freddie Mercury prior to watching the movie: Bohemian Rhapsody, but after watching the movie I am impressed with Freddie Mercury and Queen. I liked the music probably since a lot of what I heard had echoes of 1950 and 1960s music.I have read many times that Rami Malek portrayed Freddie Mercury as close as possible so I will agree that his performance is a solid and honest one and was deserving of his Best Actor Oscar Award.I see Queen's music as the next step in where Rock and Roll did go after the 1950s and 60s. The hard rock music that came in with other Rock Stars was too hard on my ears and those howling electric guitars didn't help me much. (You are just more than a little bit Country)I did learn where the Lyric 'We will , we will rock you' came from. Never knew where it came from before. Never really thought about it. Now it will never leave me.The movie didn't go into Mercury's gay relationships in any detail. In other words nothing salacious or erotic in here. His girl friend Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) knew he was gay and he admitted to her that he believed he was bi-sexual. This occurred long after he had asked her to marry him.But the music is what impressed me the most even though the lyrics were sometimes hard to understand. Lots of catchy stuff in here.Notables: Gwilym Lee as Brian May ,Queen Lead Guitarist; Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor Queen drummer; Joseph Mazzelo as John Deacon as Queen Bassist; Ace Bhatti as Mercury's father; Aaron McCusker as Jim Hutton, Mercury's significant other; Mike Myers as Mr. Foster a record label executive;
Dermot Murphy as Bob Geldof, one of the promoters of the 1985 Live Aid show.Even though Freddie Mercury was notified of his AIDS diagnosis he wanted to participate with Queen in the Live Aid show. These scenes at Live Aid with Rami Malek were probably as good as the real Freddie Mercury's performance. It was very uplifting.When the credits roll you will see the real Freddie Mercury in some performances.
I read somewhere that Freddie Mercury left all of his estate to Mary Austin, who was indeed the love of his live. He died in 1991 at age 45.All in all a great tribute to Freddie Mercury and very entertaining for all of us. (10/10)Violence: No.

Oh, Oh!This movie is a good 3-hours long. The first hour could have been cut to 10-minutes as the music was dreary, the Avengers dialogues were slow, dreary and almost defeatist, and they weren't sure how to get the people back and this went on for too long a time. Too long a time. Then Scott/Ant (Paul Rudd) says they must go back in Time to a time before Thanos gets the stones. And that is how they plan to do it.The rest of the movie has the Avengers going after the stones, then overly long CGI battles take over, but to be fair here you will see many of your celebs.The Avengers: Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man/Tony Stark; Chris Evans as Captain America/Steve Rogers; Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk; Chris Hemsworth as Thor; Scarlett Johansson as Natasha/ Black Widow; Jeremy Renner as Clint/Hawkeye; Don Cheadle as James/War Machine; Paul Rudd as Scott/Ant Man; Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange; Chadwich Boseman as T'Challa/Black Panther; Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel; and Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.Notables: Rene Russo as Frigga; Tom Hiddleston as Loki; Dave Bautista as Drax; Tilda Swenton as The Ancient One; Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan; Natali Portman as Jane; Marisa Tomei as Aunt May; Michael Douglas as Hank Pym; Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne; William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Secy of State; James D'Arcy as Jarvis; Vin Diesel as voice of Groot; Bradley Cooper as voice of Rocket; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, wife of Tony Stark; Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star Lord; Samuel L.

Don't know if it was baby me or old me.' This happened when they were experimenting going back in time. Funny.Here is a movie you can enjoy in 3-ways: The spectacular CGI, all the celebrities, and the endings ('they' go on for a while) and you will like.....maybe. Not sure I like the idea of a talking Fox. Is this put in for the kids? (Believe he is from another planet)A couple times we did hear some catchy toe-tapping music.

","Former TV cowboy star Rick Dallton (Leonardo DiCaprio) needs to resurrect his career and to stop playing the heavies (bad guys) in movies. His stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is a very good friend and supports Rick in whatever he decides to do.You need to keep in mind that when a story starts with 'Once Upon a time' that this is a fable, a tale and not something true. Got it? Good.You know this is heading toward 1969 and you know the Sharon Tate murders happened at that time.Rick eventually goes to Italy to do Spaghetti Westerns, and Cliff goes too. Cliff later goes to the George Spahn Ranch and finds the Charlie Manson Hippies have taken over the ranch where he used to do Western movies with Rick. Cliff needs to see George Spahn (Bruce Dern) to make sure he is not being taken advantage of.We are not sure where this movie is going. It is nice to see DiCaprio and Pitt and wished there was more to the story for these A List Stars. But also keep in mind that the Director is Quentin Tarantino and there is a good possibility we will see a lot of violence.Notables: Al Pacino as Marvin Schwarz, who wants Rick to break out of doing guest villain rolls in movies; Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen; Nicolas Hammond as Sam Wanamaker; Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, one of Charlie Manson's girls; Luke Perry as Wayne Maunder who stars in a western with Rick; Timothy Olyphant as James Stacey who plays a gunfighter in a movie with Rick; Rafal Zawierucha as Roman Polanski, a director Rick hopes to get close to; Margo Robbie as Sharon Tate who was a pure delight on the screen and she even went to a movie to see her performance in the movie The Wrecking Crew with Dean Martin; Austin Butler as Tex Watson, the number one male in charge of the hippies at the George Spahn ranch; Lena Dunham as Gypsy one of Charlie Manson's girls; Damon Herriman as Charlie Manson; and Margaret Qualley as Pussycat, who takes Cliff to the George Spahn ranch.The scenes with Brandy (Cliff's dog) is terrifying so be prepared. The acting and cinematography were excellent.This is an enjoyable movie, but we were still wary about where this movie was going. Well, we did find out, but still not sure why this movie was made.

1917," Very Good Soldier Story
","April, 1917 in France, British Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George Mackey) are ordered by the General to go to an isolated regiment to order them to stop their invasion because it is a trap as the Germans are lying in wait for them. Telephone lines have been cut so soldiers need to be sent. Corporal Blake has more of an incentive to make the trip because his brother Joseph is in that regiment of 1600.This is a very long movie, but the pacing is on target and there is one big surprise along the way and that was a shocker for me.For the most part we see Blake and Schofield cross into tree-less enemy territory littered with dead horses, dead bodies, mud, rats, broken tanks and guns, barbed wire and barricades; and they also had to keep watch for German strafing planes. There were many, many trenches and I felt I was going thru them with Blake and Schofield. They also entered abandoned German trenches that were booby trappedThe camera work was seamless watching Blake and Schofield go thru what seemed like miles of trenches loaded with sand bags, and heavy planks. The photography and cinematography were spot on. Suspense and tension crept in from time to time. The music was haunting at times.Notables: Mark Strong as Capt Smith who told Schofield to have witnesses when he tells Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) to stop the invasion because he likes to fight; Richard Madden as Lt Joseph Blake; Colin Firth as General Erinmore who from his desk wished Blake and Schofield good luck on their mission. The entire cast of mostly no-name professionals performed exceedingly well.This is a movie that finally gave overlong tribute to WW1soldiers.

Joker," Simply put: It's a MASTERPIECE
","Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is an aspiring stand-up comedian, but a failing one. He is not funny and worst of all he is not respected. He needs to make some changes and he becomes Joker and then things turn around for him and now he can live with himself with renewed confidence.I did not want to watch this movie, but I knew I had to. And guess what? I was more than ultimately surprised how good this movie is. Want character development? It's here in spades. I knew Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor, but in here he outdoes himself. I am more than impressed. This movie is not at all like I thought it would be. Well, that is until the ending................... And even then I accepted it. Go figure.Here is what you need to know: Arthur has a laughing condition caused by brain injury or some neurological disorder; he will give out a card telling the person about this condition; he lives with his mother; his current job is a clown in children's hospitals; he is fired from that job and tries standup; his meds are terminated since the funding in the program he was in was cancelled; his grip on reality slips into a dark world loaded with violence; all Arthur wants is to be respected and accepted, but his anger trumps all that, and he ultimately becomes the Joker. Could Batman be far behind?He learns the truth about his mother and her attempts to contact Thomas Wayne (Bret Cullen), who Arthur believes is his father. His mother, Penny (Frances Conroy) worked for Thomas Wayne back in the day. Keep in mind that Bruce Wayne's (aka Batman) father was Thomas Wayne. Hey, this happens in Gotham. Got it?Notables: Zazie Beetz as Sophie Drummon, a neighbor In a nearby apartment and it is not too clear how close she and Arthur were although they did go out together; Shea Whigham as Det Burke, who keeps trying to question Arthur for the shootings in the subway; Bill Camp as Det Garnity, Burke's partner; Robert DeNiro as Talk Show Host Murray Franklin, who is admired by Arthur and his mother.We also must give a lot of credit to Todd Phillips who wrote and directed this movie. Kudos.I will admit the ending surprised me. I had it going another way, but this way allows for BATMAN to come into play. (FYI: Batman is never mentioned in this story. Just so you know)Although I told you some things about Arthur you must see how all this unfolds and you will be impressed as was I because the pacing is excellent. And it is here that you will see the most detailed progression in Arthur's character development. I have renewed respect for Joaquin Phoenix and no matter how good the other Best Actor Oscar Nominees are, Joaquin Phoenix will win hands down. Kudos, Kudos, and more Kudos. This is without any doubt a MASTERPIECE. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: No. Language: yes, but not too much until the end.

Creed II," Very Good Fight Story
","Reluctantly, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) agrees to manage the new Heavyweight Champion of the World Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) - and he is often referred to as Donny - to go against Russian boxer Victor Drago (Florian Munteanu) whose father Ivan (Dolph Lundgren) killed Adonis' father Apollo in the ring.I have always said that there are 2-thingns that we can always count on most of the time: A fight movie and a movie about a child who goes to Heaven and comes back and tells what was experienced there. Here we go.The movie opens with an Adonis' fight when he becomes Champion of the World, then a soap opera scenario between Adonis and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) who will become Adonis's wife. Next we see a fight between Adonis and Victor Drago when Adonis wins by Victor being disqualified for an illegal hit and all this is without Rocky in Adonis' corner.Then later Rocky becomes Adonis' trainer to again fight Victor and teaches Adonis to train differently along with some boxing techniques not previously used by Adonis.Notables: Brigitte Nielsen as Victor Drago's mother; Phylicia Rashad as Adonis' mother. Wood Harris as Tony, Adonis' manager against the first fight with Victor Drago and he is also he one to let Adonis know Victor wants a rematch, but in Russia.So we have a very good fight story that includes a little bit of a Soap, concerns over the hearing of Adonis' baby, determination, commitment, loyalty and doing the right thing for the right reason.The fight at the end l gets us twisting, and dodging blows on the couch we are on. The fight looked too real. I don't know how they do it but the body blows really look too real to just be movie magic. (But that is what it is.I did notice that when anyone greeted Rocky, they never used the term 'champ' but instead Rocky or Mr. Balboa. I mean he was a champion of the world at one time and usually 'Champ' is used. Quite strange.The ending was very good, but I would liked to have seen that street light in front of Rocky's house in Philly finally light up after Rocky's complaint that it hasn't worked for years, but that is just me. Then again Rocky finally gets up the courage to visit his estranged son Robert (Milo Ventimiglia) who now has a son Logan (Robbie Johns). I mention all this because you will see all again in another sequel to the Rocky Balboa story. Pretty sure.Yes, there will be sequels, but right now we are waiting for that child to go to Heaven and come back and tell us what was experienced there. Can't wait. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Midway," Perhaps the most complete telling of the Battle of Midway
","The Battle of Midway starts with the invasion of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 7 December 1941. From a statement in the beginning of the movie, 'The Battle of Midway turned the tide of the war in the Pacific.'This is a more complete story because of the expertise of the code breakers, numerous books about Midway and the people involved. But also because Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and his cryptologists who surmised that AF is the Japanese code for Midway and another clue mentions the water supply (at AF) is down. Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) is impressed and goes with that info and now knows the Japanese target is Midway.The CGI in here is most incredible and credit must be given to the person who edited all the aerial fight scenes. Kudos.Notables: Ed Skrein as Dick Best, a cocky pilot under Commander McClusky (Luke Evans); Patrick Wilson as Edwin Layton an intelligence analyst and aid to Adm Nimitz; Mandy Moore as Ann Best, wife of Dick Best; Dennis Quaid as Admiral Halsey; Aaron Eckhart as Jimmy Doolittle; Nick Jonas as Bruno Guido, a seaman promoted for jumping into a plane and firing and destroying a Japanese fighter plane and who also was captured by the Japanese who wanted information from him and he insulted the Japanese officer who threw him overboard with an anchor tied to his feet; Tadanobu Asano as Japanese Admiral Yamaguchi; Etsushi Toyokawa as Japanese Admiral Yamamoto; Geoffrey Blake as Movie Director John Ford who was in the process of making a movie on Midway when the Japanese attacked.Ed Skrein as Dick Best is given most screen time in here and he is quite a character. But my vote for any Oscar goes to Woody Harrelson as Admiral Nimitz. As I have said before, when Woody Harrelson is in a movie, just give him the Oscar for Best Actor and move on. He is always that good. Got it?The cinematography is simply outstanding. It's like you are actually there in every battle scene. Am glad this wasn't in 3-D otherwise I may have had to check myself into the ER. Might anyway. The pacing is excellent and there are no long drawn out CGI battles.I remember the MIDWAY movie with Charlton Heston back in the day. In that movie I recall that Navy Pilot, George Gay, played by Kevin Dobson was shot down and watched the Battle of Midway from the water. I mention this because George Gay was from my hometown and later became a pilot for TWA. But no George Gay in this one. I kind of missed it.Watching this movie I can only hope that all who see this movie are reminded that very brave men and women fought in these battles and allow us to live the way we do because of their heroics. God Bless them all. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Hey, this is war.

Green Book," Without a Doubt, this Deserved the Best Picture Oscar Award
","This is based upon true eventsIn 1962 in New York, due to the Copa Cabana closing for renovations, club Bouncer, Tony Lip (Mortensen) needs a job and takes one driving Dr. Donald Shirley (Mahershala Ali) a snobbish person, but also a genius pianist to concerts in the deep south.Tony is given the Green Book which is called The Negro Motorist Green Book, which tells Blacks traveling in the south the safe places to eat and rest.This is a movie that we will see attitudes and prejudices change and it won't be easy for both Tony and Dr. Shirley. We will see Dr. Shirley try to cultivate Tony as best he can and that is an uphill battle, but Tony rolls with the punches. It's not at all quite obvious, but changes are happening within Dr. Shirley, too.It is definitely the script banter that wins in here. It is honest and often very funny. At one point Tony tells Dr Shirley that he, Tony, is more black than he is because he (Dr. Shirley) knows nothing of the current black music, has never eaten fried chicken and really doesn't know how the blacks live and he sits on his throne looking down on everyone. And to be sure, Dr. Shirley has a good rebuttal for all this.Notable: Linda Cardellini as Dolores, Tony's wife.We also see troubles along the way and most times Tony handles all. One time Dr. Shirley gets them out of trouble and he admits to calling someone in Washington DC and that person called Robert Kennedy, the Attorney General of the United States to help and he did.The banter between Tony and Dr. Shirley is pure gold and this keeps us engaged and hoping for the best.Near the end I kept hoping that the family dinner at Tony's would encounter one more knock on their door. You'll see what I mean.This movie is definitely a MUST SEE. You won't be disappointed.Stay tuned before the credits run for pictures of the real Tony and Dr. Shirley and statements of how Tony and Dr. Shirley ended up. (10/10)Violence: No.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Loads of it.
Language: Only one F-bomb.
