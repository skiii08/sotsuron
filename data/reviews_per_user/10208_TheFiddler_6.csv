The Ring," Disturbing
","here we go folks... NO movie ever has made me stick to the message board or write e mail back and forth or talk to friends about it or made me think about its meaningthat much like this one. NO movie ever has me scared that much that I sat in my chair , tears running down my cheeks, goose bumps all over, willing to look away from thescreen just to make sure I do miss what happens nextNormally a movie has lost its fascination for me when it is over and I start thinking : Why did they do that, that could not happen in reality, impossible... Not with this one. I am trying to get behind the secrets of this movie, what it should express, follow hints that are given to try and get the bigger picture. It freaked me out, scared me to death. A roller coaster ride from the very beginning and you do hope it might end every second. Once finished,exhausted and disturbed, I was glad it was over and I survived... Not that I am not into a good shocker or can't handle the ones I have seen before butthis is something new. A modern gothic horror that leaves many questions unanswered but this exactly makes it worth watching it another time...if youdare to go through all this again... I am burning for to get it on DVD , even though I know what happened and how it ended I don't know anything,want to solve the mystery behind Samaras existence, the reason for what she did, what Rachel's intentions are, what role the Innkeeper played and howwho could have been saved and more victims be avoided... With its special effects, back flashes and 'art-student-like' video shots this is something new in the era of horror/thriller films it occupies you from the very first shot until the very last. Even though I felt like I knew what happens next all the time during the movie, it came even worse and more terrifying. But the less you know about this one and the less you expect the better...so get in there, watch it and think about how you feel like the next seven daysonce you've made it... if you'll make it...",10,0,0,22 November 2002
Snatch," 8 solid points
","Funnier than Lock,Stock...but not really different than it, that is why it is only worth eight points for me. As Lock,Stock, it is tricky, the plot not too complicated to get, the actors playing all convincing gangsters,killers,thiefs,whatever but in the end it reminds way too much of the ending of Lock,Stock... The jokes and gags are brilliant, the slang isn't too hard to get ( except for Brad Pitt = excellent acting ! ) so if you liked Lock...you will love Snatch !",8,0,1,19 March 2002
Scary Movie 2," No more than an addition of movie quotes...
","...but good fun anyways. Even though there was promised never to come up with a sequel The Wayans Bros did it and again it is no smash hit but worth to watch. The biggest fun is to guess what movie they are making a fun out of in every scene, useless to watch if you are not in the scary movie genre. 'Hollow Man, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Hannibal' just to name a few. Charlies Angels, one of the best weelchair chases ever and 75 mins of very rude jokes spice it up a little. The movie has its scary effects, is funny but not one of those you will watch twice or thrice...",6,0,0,26 December 2001
Face_Off," Cool actors, tension rising from minute to minute, but silly storyline
","As taste is a very controversial topic it might be risky to state : This is the best movie I have ever seen', but it is! With tension rising from minute to minute it is hard for me to let go of this movie even now I have seen it like twenty times... Archer/Troy, Troy/Archer sometimes it nearly seemed to me that Cage/Travolta  really switched faces.  The only thing worrying me is the storyline, but a movie has not to be realistic to be good as long as you believe everything while watching it ( The first thing that came to my mind when Troy's men enter the lab is: How can two men enter a high technology lab ? It surely had to be guided very well with a 'product' like this inside ) So therefore only a nine.",9,0,1,31 October 2001
Hero," My First Chinese Movie in ages ***Spoilers***
","Just saw Hero last night and am still overwhealmed. To be honest it takes a lot as a gweilo to not be disappointed by the fighting scenes and the way they jump between tree branches and over a lake and stuff. But hey I loved The Lord of The Rings and aren't Cave Trolls and Orks part of Western Mythology. Apart from feeling a bit odd watching these fighting scenes, THEY ARE JUST WONDERFULLY SHOT, especially the one on the water. Getting the story delivered from a different point of view makes it even more interesting as only the end reveals what really was going on. The costumes are fantastic, the locations they have shot this one in so breathtaking that I would wish I would have given movies like this a chance earlier. I cannot imagine watching this movie dubbed in english. Everyone who has the chance to watch it in mandarin with subtitles, give it a try, only like this , the movie feels authentic. Great actors, great dialogues, but honestly speaking I do not think that westerners who aren't in touch with chinese mentality, history and lifestyle will give too much about it.... A Masterpiece !!!!",9,0,0,14 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Never thought this could be so nice !
","Okay there here we go I thought watching a movie done for children. All the advertisements for it, the articles about the books and the movie and finally my boss, referring the books to me made me have a closer look at all this. When I started to read the Sorcerer's Stone I was quite amazed. People on the train looked at me, a 25 year old guy reading a childrens book, not stopping to laugh...I was that amused that I decided to stop reading until I saw the movie and I can tell you : This one's a great one. Nice characters : Harry, Hermine, Ron, wonderful effects, good action ( I loved the Wizard's chess match at the end ), some good scary effects packed in a nice story. What else do you want ? This one was definitely one of the better ones in 2001 and is a good appetizer for the sequels to come. The only thing that disturbed me was the Quidditch matches as the effects sometimes looked too cheap, but hey there you get more than 2 hours of good laughs, scary effects and real nice special fx....Will continue reading the book now...",7,0,1,5 January 2002
