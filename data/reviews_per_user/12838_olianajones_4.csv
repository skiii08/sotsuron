Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force is....Not so Strong in This Film......
","I imagine the hype that this film must have had on it before its release. After all, Star Wars is arguably the biggest franchise in film history, stretching out over all mediums possible from books, music and even fashion. Even before all the prequels, Star Wars was the undisputed king of all franchises in film. So its also easy for me to imagine why people where so disappointed when the film came out. But come on, I was only six when Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace came out. I was seeing this through the eyes of a child, and couldn't pick up on the very serious problems that I now see this film has, twelve years later.So the story starts out in the familiar setting of a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. Very quickly though, it is apparent that this is a much different galaxy to the one we have become accustomed to with the original Star Wars films. CGI and Jedi Knights galore, contradictory plot points and abdominal CGI characters fill our screens instead of the retro cool Luke Skywalker and Han Solo of the original trilogy.The basic plot of this film bases around the young Obi Wan Kenobi and his master Qui Gon Jinn, who have been sent by the senate to settle a trade dispute on a planet called Naboo. Things go wrong very quickly and through circumstances too detailed to explain briefly they find themselves on Tatooine in which we see the story's genesis - the tale of Darth Vader aka Anakin Skywalker.I think there is no main problem with The Phantom Menace, just many small problems that add up and outweigh anything that could be positive about this film. When I think of The Phantom Menace, I get a feeling of nausea and a headache rushes upon me, when it really should be the opposite of that because Star Wars has always made me feel youthful and as though anything is possible. That about really sums up everything I feel about this film, however there are a few diamonds in the rough with Ep1.Liam Neeson does try his best to be subtle and wise as the Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn, however he really does say some stupid things and makes some idiotic decisions in this, which are very un-Jedi like. Sorry Liam Neeson, not enough to save the film. The Pod Races are a nice attraction and a good blend of live action sets and CGI, however it really could have all been skipped. Darth Maul, the evil assassin of which the film has its title of, is a dazzle to watch in the breathtaking saber battle at the climax of the film, but he barely says anything in the film and adds little intrigue to what the Sith even are. Another waste. There are several live action sets, which certainly help to give the film an organic sense of something actually happening, but then that is ruined as well with CGI backgrounds added. In fact, the only truly positive thing I can think about The Phantom Menace for is its score by John Williams, which is superb. Ow, and Yoda was still a puppet...that doesn't last for long either.Then we reach the marvellously intriguing argument/debate on midechlorians, the supposed genesis of where the force comes from. Whilst I do understand the outrage this sub-plot produces, stating that the force comes from a biological genesis rather than a spiritual one (which the original films preached about) I do now think I understand what George Lucas wanted to achieve with this one. In my opinion, the midechlorians, at least from the point of the mythology of Star Wars, poses a certain contrast to how in real life, science tries to explain religion. Jedi's in the Star Wars universe may be split half way with the midechlorians too, with half of them feeling the need to push forward a new idea about the force (Qui Gon for example goes on about it quite a lot) and others may opt for the more traditional view of the force as a spiritual energy field (Yoda and Obi Wan).In summary, I can only conclude that The Phantom Menace is a film for kids, if there ever was one. No doubt, the original Star Wars as a fantasy for kids and adults alike, but there is also no doubt in my mind that George Lucas concocted Jar Jar Binks as a marketing scheme, much like the rest of this film...and what a genius he is...look how rich he has become.",6,1,4,31 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is.....Really Not With This One......
","When George Lucas says to the audience that the original trilogy is really one whole film with three parts in it, he describes The Empire Strikes Back as the middle act in which 'nothing really happens' well I wish he had applied that description to this film, because even though, yes Empire is the middle act, it is far more exciting than this film.In my review of The Phantom Menace, predecessor of this Star Wars film, I basically came to the conclusion that it was a children's film, a film made for commerical value aka lets make as many toys as we can for the kids. That is what a generally think of when I think of The Phantom Menace. However, when I think of Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones, I genuinely find it hard to find anything about this film, much less anything positive, it really is that bad at times. My general rule of film viewing is this, no matter how bad I've heard it is, I at least try and see some positive points in the film, then at least I can salvage something good from the experience, but with Episode 2, there really isn't anything to recover from the mess that it is.The second film in the Star Wars saga sees Anakin Skywalker now a grown man, and I use that term lightly, because he certainly acts more like he did in the first film than we have been told of in the original trilogy. Anakin and his master Jedi Obi Wan Kenobi (seeing Ewan McGregor reprise his role) have been assigned to protect Senator Padme Amidala from being assassinated by a bounty hunter supposedly working for a separatist movement who are wanting to leave the republic and possibly declare war on them. The two Jedi go on an investigation into the conspiracy which sees them taken to different planets as we finally see the beginning of the clone wars, and ultimately, the fall of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side.See when the plot is put like that, it doesn't sound too bad, its just that when put into film and written as poorly as it is, the film falls flat on its back with a giant thud. The biggest difference between this film and the last one becomes apparent immediately and that is the change of actor for Anakin. A lot of hate on the subject of Anakin, and I will say this. Hayden Christiansen himself is not a bad actor, some of his work outside of Star Wars is pretty good, and he does his best with the material given to him, however it isn't his fault that the material isn't very good. Anakin Skywalker was supposed to be a great guy, and in this film he is presented as though he was on the dark side right from the start. This here is the film's biggest error. We cannot get behind someone who has traits of being traitorous to the republic and who commits mass murder on the sand people after he finds his mother has been murdered by them and we cannot route for someone who is generally just not a nice person and acts superior to everyone around him. In the first star wars film, we are explained Anakin Skywalker was a nice guy who was noble and courageous. It turns out though, that he was selfish, ignorant and didn't listen to his superiors. The whole character of Anakin is one giant contradiction and it is a shame that he is central to the whole point of Star Wars, which is good triumphs over evil, when really the good was evil from the beginning.The gratuitous CGI in the last film is turned up full throttle on this one, as there are barely any live on set scenes in this one and everything becomes fake and artificial. Even Yoda is CGI in this one, much to the annoyance of loyal fans around the world. Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are disappointingly wooden as well, despite both of their massive talents. Even the mighty Christopher Lee, who plays the film's villain Count Dooku is on auto pilot in this one.If I had to try and think of anything positive about this film, it would be the score, a large part of what makes Star Wars so memorable. Indeed, The Phantom Menace had a superb score and this one has a decent score too, so well done John Williams. It's just a shame the volume wasn't turned up so we could dub out the god-awful dialogue between Anakin and Padme when they're supposed to be in love.In conclusion, Attack of the Clones is by far the worst Star Wars film, but if you're an avid fan of the mythos of Star Wars, as I am myself, its unfortunate that you cannot avoid it. Attack of the Clones is indeed the middle piece where not much happens, but without it, the story would make even less sense. George Lucas is laughing to the bank once again.",5,1,4,21 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Force is....Sort of with this one....
","So finally after sitting through two disastrous films that bare no resemblance whatsoever to the original Star Wars trilogy, it finally seemed with Episode 3, the final part in the epic Star Wars saga, that George Lucas had sat down with his producers and said 'alright, we're gonna cut the fat out and leave in the muscle'. Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith (a clever title that harks back to what may have been the original title for Return of the Jedi) definitely cuts out the fat of the first two films, however that loose skin still remains.The concluding part to the tale of Anakin Skywalker sees the young Jedi, now a mighty warrior, along with his fellow Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor reprises again) starting off the film flying through a huge space battle trying to rescue the Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDarmid) from the evil General Grievous and Count Dooku. Once returned from battle, the clone wars intensifies to its final battle and the tragic turn to the dark side for Anakin Skywalker finally draws to a close.I've always been fascinated with the idea of Anakin turning to the dark side, despite it being set up so poorly in the previous films, the execution is much better, however there are some flaws with it. When Anakin has pledged allegiances to Darth Sidious, he still parades around as a Jedi and doesn't fully embrace the yellow sith eyes until much later. If Anakin is now an alleged Sith Lord, he should be proud of it and not hide it from everyone. Stupid and annoying. However, the seduction and promise of greater power speaks volumes in terms of undertones. Star Wars has always done a great job of defining right and wrong (the original trilogy at least) but the simple message of taking a shortcut will lead to evil and working hard will gain you respect I feel is a great message to fans and people of all ages.Other flaws with Episode 3 include yet more CGI, however time was spent it seems to make this CGI look better than in Attack of the Clones, but even still, we are treated to barely no live action sets, and without it, the film loses a feeling of realism and occasion. The acting nearly overall is pretty dull once again, Ewan McGregor of course being the biggest disappointment. When he learns of Anakin's turn to the dark side, his reaction is so unconvincing that it seems as though maybe Obi-Wan never liked Anakin anyway because it clearly doesn't look too big of a deal to him. Another problem with Episode 3 is the secondary villain, General Grievous, the reptile/alien/robot/cyborg thing that leads the droid army. His screen time is so sparse and his dialogue so indecipherable that there isn't much interest in the character to invest in.However, the big triumph in this film is the devilishly evil performance by Ian McDarmid as Darth Sidious (The devil of the Star Wars mythos) who tempts Anakin to become his young apprentice with the promise of saving Anakin's wife, Padme from death in childbirth. Of course, these are all lies, and Anakin must pay the price for making his deal with the devil by having to spend an eternity in the figurative hell, or the Darth Vader suit. All of this thanks to this great performance, Ian McDarmid has you eating out of his hands.Another great spectacle in this film is the great lightsaber battles. I think all Star Wars fans anticipate every lightsaber battle in all the films with excitement as some of Star Wars greatest moments have happened during the duels. The climax of the film sees Anakin and Obi-Wan battle it out simultaneously to Yoda and Sidious while the superb 'duel of fates' score plays makes for a terrific conclusion and one heck of a final lightsaber fight.In the end, the film finishes on a note that looks somewhat familiar. The death star is being built, Anakin gets all Darth Vader'd up and Obi-Wan leaves the baby Luke Skywalker with his family on tatooine, looking out into the sunset, re-creating one of Star Wars most famous images of looking out to the future, looking out to a better place. So even though evil has won the day in this film, there is a small hope in the form of the future, in the form of Luke Skywalker, and thank god for that, because that means the prequels are over!",7,1,5,27 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It feels so good to review films that are actually awesome!
","STAR WARS! Just the title evokes a reaction and what follows is a series of emotions. Passion, joy, love, laughter, anticipation and excitement. A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away there was once such a thing as really good films, and Star Wars may be just about the greatest of them all. Without going into too much detail on the other films of the original trilogy, Star Wars may actually be the best of the three just because of its simplicity. Sure Empire takes it to a deeper level, but Star Wars is just the simple and relatable fable of Dorothy on her farm, wishing for a greater existence in life, however in Star Wars our Dorothy is Luke Skywalker, searching for his own purpose in life. We've all been there surely? That's what great films are made of.Star Wars starts out with a small and soon to be obsolete rebel ship being pursued by the ominous and disturbingly bad guy looking star destroyer of the evil empire! The storm troopers soon board and take control of the ship, lead by their captain in command, Darth Vader. The moment Vader steps out from the smoke, stands tall above the dead rebels and his infamous breathing begins, one can easily distinguish the fact he is the most bad-ass evil villain in the history of villainy. And he is. No doubt Vader is as bad as they come, but you instantly get the sense there is more to this guy than first appearances would give. More on that later. So Vader and his storm troopers take the Princess Leia hostage, played wonderfully by Carrie Fisher, who has sent her faithful R2-D2 and his tag along C-3PO away with the plans of destroying the death star, down to tattooine, the Sahara of the galaxy. Que Luke Skywalker, played subtly by Mark Hamill, who dreams of a bigger purpose in life. The chances of fate bring him and the two droids together and from there the film catapults young Luke into the adult world of the rebellion fighting for freedom against the empire.So many great characters to talk about in Star Wars, Han Solo takes the cake for being the best character for my money. He is cocky, smug and shows growth of character the most throughout the film. Harrison Ford created his first iconic character in the arrogant and charming space pilot, captain of the millennium falcon (another amazing creation) and best friend to wookie Chewbacca. I also really like the character of Ben Kenobi. Not only was Alec Guiness the superb choice to be cast as the character, there is so much depth and richness to the character too. Ben is just an old guy hiding in the desert of tattooine to begin with, but once he rescues Luke and they get off of tattooine with Han Solo and the gang, Ben starts opening his mouth and you really get the sense that this guy was once a really formidable Jedi, and still is to an extent. The real power of the force lies within his voice, within his wisdom and advice, which are truly inspiring, not only for Luke, but for the viewer too. Not only is Ben a great mentor and adviser, he is a bad-ass. His climatic duel with Vader is not only thrilling but also insightful, as Ben willingly sacrifices himself, realising he will pave the way for Luke to become a Jedi and save the galaxy. Awesome stuff.Special effects are also a triumph in this film. Everything from the glow of the lightsaber to the fantastic final battle of the death star at the climax of the film all come together in a crescendo of beautiful storytelling. It isn't just effects for the sake of effects, they are in aid of the story and help enhance it. Also, the score of Star Wars is truly memorable and without a doubt, the opening credit sequence of the film along with its famous score makes for a thrilling film moment every viewing.Star Wars has so many great themes involved, but as Ben realises when he surrenders himself to Vader, it is all about the bigger picture. Its about the future, its about growth and learning, coming of age and of course, Han shot first. Star Wars might just be the perfect film of all time.",10,6,7,20 January 2012
