Scarface," The Teachings Of Mama Montana
","When you raise kids, you notice that the most critical issues do not lie with education, but within the influence of the community. Mama Montana is an admirable mother who has Values, Principles and Ideals and fights for them. She is an honest worker and her teaching about ugly money that stinks is the best kind of education parents can give to their children:
'Mama Montana: Son? I wish I had one! He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a bum now! Who do you think you are, hm? We haven't heard a word from you in five years. Cinco anos. You suddenly show up here and you throw money at us? You think you can *buy* me with your money?
Tony Montana: Come on, mama.
Mama Montana: You think you can come in here with your hot-shot clothes and make fun of us?
Tony Montana: Mama, you don't know what you're talking about.
Mama Montana: No that is NOT the way I am, Antonio! That is *not* the way I raised Gina to be. You are not going to destroy her. I don't need your money. Gracias! I work for my living. *I don't want you in this house anymore!* I don't want you around Gina! So come on, get out! And take this lousy money with you! It stinks!'",10,0,1,30 June 2019

The Expendables 2," Even bigger than the first episode
","The scene where the oppressed village and the imprisoned kids are liberated by The Expendables, like when Indiana Jones frees the children from the slavery of the temple of doom, makes me think that all American heroes, and superheroes, should go to the US-Mexican border and the White House, in order to destroy the liberticidal and unethical system that plagues the land of the free and home of the brave...

Rocky V," An intimate and mature Rocky, which is a superb lesson of Love, Humility, Respect and Life
","Sly once again puts all his Heart and Soul into an intimate and mature Rocky, which is a superb lesson of Love, Humility, Respect and Life. After the opening credits, we find Rocky in the shower following his fight against the last titan he had to face. He cannot stop his hands from shaking, because after taking so many hits in his life he suffers from a brain injury. Back from the medical office, Rocky and Adrian still learn that following the general power of attorney that Paulie unknowingly had Rocky sign for the benefit of their accountant, the latter abused them by stealing their finances and gambling them on the stock market. Having lost everything, materially, the Balboa-Pennino family returns to Rosehill Street in the modest neighborhoods of Philadelphia. Where the family was born, grew up, and has always been at home, without the gold, without the chrome, in the dark streets they have learned to love thanks to the bright hearts of those who live there and illuminate the darkness with their modesty and their affection.
From the corrupt accountant to the greedy businessman who wants to buy everything and everyone with complete disregard for the True Values: The Values of Abnegation, Courage, Effort, but above all The Values of the Heart and Spirit, this fifth episode is a harsh criticism of savage capitalism and its predators who corrupt and destroy everything they touch. There comes a time when castles fall, but not the Compassion, and Rocky had to learn to 'lose' to be able to win again, with his Heart, in order to defeat those who wanted to destroy him and his Family. Now he can lose and choose, understand what he had fled, and fully grasp the measure of the man who has come full circle by going to hell and back.",10,4,6,11 March 2019

",#TheExpendables (2010) is an effective parable on 'banana republics' set up by colonial and imperialist powers. It is enjoyed as an homage to the action movies and stars of the late last century. Sylvester Stallone demonstrates all his know-how in the making and the screenplay showcases this historic cast with a good dose of humor about themselves. It's full of winks that play with nostalgia.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Learning Humanity
","T2, for close friends, is a far-reaching cinematographic and social phenomenon.James Cameron, who is well known for his legendary perfectionism, finally had the budget and artistic control to bring his titanic visions to life in his first movie of monumental proportions, which acknowledged him as an Author, before his final cut of Abyss in 1992, his Titanic in 1997, his Avatar in 2009, and before the next chapters of this extremely rich universe, which in turn will revolutionize the world of cinema during this decade.Perfection; that is the right word! Because, James Cameron invests with head, heart, body and soul for decades in his pharaonic projects. And his magic achieves such top performance in all areas pertaining to his monuments, which are also laboratories of technical innovation, that they instantly become classic, cult and pivotal works that change the face of cinematic art.There is a 'before and after' T2 for the whole team who contributed to the creation of that 'Judgment Day', as well as for any discerning moviegoer and simple average spectator. No superlative words were good enough to describe Terminator 2 when it was released in 1991, from the biggest budget in the history of filmmaking, to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton then at the peak of their glory in the role of their lives, to revolutionary special effects, especially those regarding the liquid metal T-1000, also embodied with icy perfection by Robert Patrick. James the Magician thus began his journey to becoming crowned 'King of the World' at the North American and worldwide box office, as well as at the Academy Awards.As far as I'm concerned, it's also the film of superlatives that broke all records, since I saw this movie ten times in theaters, between its world premiere at Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas in Century City, Los Angeles, and different cinemas in various places both in California and in Europe, between July and December 1991. Overall, I have seen this film eighteen times to date, in five languages, and on three continents.His Teaching: 'Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too.'",10,0,0,5 January 2020
Rocky IV," Cold War
","Even if Stallone does not completely destroys the film and his character like in Rambo: First Blood, Part II, which flirts with a nauseating anti-Vietnamese fascism, it is clear that this biggest commercial success of the saga, which stimulated much attention from the press because of his Cold War hints during the years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, suffers from evils that do not belong to the wonderful character Rocky Balboa. And it's a shame, because with the exception of the primary anti-Soviet propaganda, this fourth episode is not a bad movie in itself. The final message of peace, which relativizes the US warmongering character of the film to tend towards a certain humanism, is salutary: 'I came here tonight, I didn't know what to expect. I saw a lot of people hate me and I didn't know what to feel about that so I guess they didn't like much nothin' either. During this fight, I've seen a lot of changing, the way you felt about me, and in the way I felt about you. In here, there were two guys killing each other, but I guess that's better than 20 million. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change! '",10,0,1,10 March 2019

Batman Begins," 'Why do we fall? ... So that we can learn to pick ourselves up!'
","Here is Gotham City, at the twilight of humanity. A parable of a materialistic world deliberately distorted as if it were the expression of a totally corrupt essence, where the absence of civility and compassion of abject beings obsessed with maximum profit at all costs rules. #BatmanBegins is just as dark as #TimBurton's masterful duology, but it is even tougher because it is inked in 'reality' and grabs the viewer's guts. The film starts with a detailed explanation of the origins of #TheDarkKnight. From the trauma of childhood up to a philosophical and martial training path - 'Buddhist': the renunciation, exploring one's dark side and mastering fear, the right views and actions, the path of the middle way, 'Nietzschean': what does not kill you makes you stronger, and 'Chivalrous': protecting the weak... - Ready to fight against injustice, Bruce Wayne returns to this decaying society. And #ChristianBale delivers an outstanding portrayal of #TheCapedCrusader! Who becomes a symbol fighting the evils that plague our society. Just like #RevengeOfTheSith', #BatmanBegins is a blockbuster militating for a better world; several scenes are real gems: When the 'godfather' is surrounded by bribe-takers including law enforcers of all ranks. When Bruce Wayne is feigning intoxication and chastising the hypocrisy of the intelligentsia of the city. When the founding father of Wayne Enterprises has always rejected the IPO of the patrimony, but the corrupt new CEO allows himself to dismiss employees who honor the memory of Thomas Wayne. I highly recommend this masterpiece and I am already eagerly waiting for the next episodes.

Mission: Impossible II," The most romantic-tragic episode of the saga
","John Woo's style, which is known for his highly chaotic action sequences, stylized imaginary, Mexican impasses, frequent use of slow motion and his allusions to neo-noir, wuxia and anti-western, gives this action spy film a unique dimension in the universe of Ethan Hunt. Interpreted with all the professional ethics and artistic and technical virtuosity that Tom Cruise breathes into the portrayal of each of his roles regardless of genre and character; which has already earned him three Oscar nominations.In this second episode of the saga, Ethan Hunt's mission is to intercept 'The Chimera'. An extremely dangerous synthetic virus, which is in the hands of unscrupulous mobsters working in the opaque and deadly world of the biopharmaceutical cartels. Where viruses, and their antidotes, are created to profit off health and life of entire populations.At the beginning of his mission, Ethan meets the beautiful and mysterious Nyah, who comes to life as the delightful and talented Thandie Newton, with whom he lives the most romantic-tragic episode of the saga. His two usual teammates, Luther Strickell interpreted by Ving Rhames and Billy Baird played by John Polson, indefectibly support him; and these intense and tragic events are perfectly underlined by Hans Zimmer's captivating soundtrack.Many factors, among other things, that contribute to make this second opus the best of the saga. Even if 'Ghost Protocol (2011)' and especially 'Fallout (2018)' also shine in the firmament of this universe, which was born on the small screen in 1966.

Rocky III," To hell and back
","In this third installment of the saga, Sly is still directing and puts all his heart and soul into it as always. He explores how celebrity impacts a man's life; its euphoric and destructive effects on the personality.

Then follows a mortifying defeat against Clubber Lang, interpreted magnificently by the dark and impressive Mr. T, while Mickey is leaving us. Finally, a reconquest of the world title after mourning Mickey and regaining 'the eye of the tiger'! Thanks to Apollo, who becomes his coach, and to his faithful wife Adrian, who shows a strong character here, when she was very shy at the beginning, and encourages Rocky to fight not only in the ring but above all in life! To hell and back: Rocky III is an effective, breathtaking, and motivating story, so much so that it is used as a reference tool in the physical and mental preparation of many people, who have to face a harsh trial in their life. Emmanuèle Bernheim wrote a beautiful book about this topic, simply entitled 'Stallone'. It narrates the tough obstacle course of a person to whom life throws a lot of hits. Thanks to the inspiration of Sly in general, and Rocky III in particular, the character is able to take the hits, go the distance and win in the end. Personally, I have also used this film for all my exams and most important challenges and setbacks in my life since 1988.
Physically, Stallone inflicted a drastic diet on himself again to lose 20 to 40 pounds through the absorption of ten egg whites and a toast per day. And then regain the same weight, in muscle mass only, during the shooting via the consumption of cereals, fish, high doses of honey coffee and intense physical training. Abnegation, inspiration, writing, preparation, directing and incarnation of Rocky Balboa; Sylvester Stallone is an author and one of the great figures of the contemporary American cinema!

Whatever some may think, Gal Gadot is a perfect cast, because she is brilliant and her charisma shines through the screen: both fragile and strong, tender and caring, but ready to fight the evil that men do. Looking forward to seeing The Amazon Princess again in 'Wonder Woman 1984' next summer.",10,5,19,8 September 2019

Black Panther," World Peace
","Ryan Coogler enters the MCU with flying colors: The final speech at the United Nations should be shown everywhere, around the world, for everybody to learn from it and realize that we are all Human brothers and sisters before being anything else.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," If You Don't Cry
","Nearly four decades after 'Star Wars' fever hit the world for the first time in 1977 and initiated 'The Skywalker Saga' (1977-2019) with 'The Original Trilogy' (1977-1983), and thirty-two years after 'The Return of the Jedi' (1983), the original cast is back in 'The Force Awakens'. A seventh episode that marks the beginning of 'The Sequel Trilogy' (2015-2019), which is about to close the 'The Skywalker Saga' with the release of 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' on December 20, 2019.
Star Wars is political, and it always has been. The Empire is a white supremacist organization that wants to dominate and destroy all known worlds and civilizations. Each episode is a powerful allegory and parable about fascism. A rallying cry to stand up and fight back Nazis all of kinds wherever they invade in the universe. A sumptuous cinematographic fresco painted by a team of visual artists who enlighten, inspire and bring the impossible to life, while upholding the right to difference and equality regardless of origin. A standard of universal love that teaches who our real families and allies are regardless of blood and traditions.
In this extremely emotional episode, if you do not cry when Han Solo and Chewbacca appear for the first time since 1983. When Princess Leia shows up after 32 years. When the son Han had with Leia kills his father, and when Ray finally climbs up cliffs and finds Luke Skywalker with all the wounds and scars he has accumulated over time and fights, I don't know how I can explain to you what Star Wars was, is and will forever be.",10,4,21,9 September 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Grand Finale
","I had not seen a Harry Potter movie since The Deathly Hallows Part 1 in a theater in 2010. Part 2, which I missed in the cinema in 2011, is like the previous half-episode: good, with some very good elements, but it is not exactly 'The Grand Finale' that we could expect.

Gladiator," A masterfully crafted film
","General for whom all the men who served under his command are ready to die. Gladiator beloved by the plebs of the most distant provinces of the empire like that of Rome and respected by his battle companions. Regretted lover and most especially husband and father loving in life as in eternity. Such is Maximus, the spiritual son of Marcus Aurelius, who lived according to the principles of this father: WISDOM, JUSTICE, RIGOR and COURAGE. A masterfully crafted film by Ridley Scott, who wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous movies and hired several historians as advisors. The story is carried by an epic breath, very well represented by a haunting and beautiful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. The sets, including the reconstruction of ancient Rome are magnificent. Actors and actress are beyond perfect for their roles.",10,0,0,1 July 2019
Back to the Future," Three decades later the magic still operates, both with the nostalgic of these times and new generations who discover this saga with delight
","The adventures of the McFlies and the Tannens, as well as Professor Brown, between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, are part of the great classics of the 1980s. In this first episode, we discover Marty and his family, Jennifer Parker, Biff Tannen, Emmet Brown and Einstein. Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis put together a cast of anthology (the hallmark of American cinema in the 1980s) to bring to life an inventive story that travels between 1985 and 1955 with insight, humor and liveliness. Three decades later the magic still operates, both with the nostalgic of these times and new generations who discover this saga with delight.",10,0,0,4 March 2019
