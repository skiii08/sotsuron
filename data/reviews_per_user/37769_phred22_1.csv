The Blair Witch Project," Not entertaining but a noble experiment
","I get a feeling that the most effective thing about this movie was the on-the-net hype, most of which I missed. I suspect it was more entertaining than seeing these three people get lost in the woods and get more and more strung out. While I won't claim to have felt particularly scared, I will say this movie has three excellent performances of people being terrified. But it's not a pretty sight. I suspect I'm also the wrong audience because I've lived in rural Maryland and seen plenty of woods like these. They just aren't that scary to me.",Null,1,2,14 August 1999
