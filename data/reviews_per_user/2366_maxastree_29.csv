Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Great acting, overrated comedy of its day.
","When this film released to theaters, reviewers were literally falling over themselves to give the picture a 'two thumbs up', check Rottentomates.com for an impression of the critical response to the movie. You can also find TV interview segments on Youtube where Sasha Cohen, the star of this comedy, admits freely that the film is overrated.Why? Well, for starters there's a tendency to put too much gloss on everything in the world of Hollywood, as if production technique is as important (or clearly, more important) than having an original idea. Also, much of the sentiment and emotion in US cinema is generalized at best, or grandstanding propaganda at worst.'Borat' the movie follows a Kazakh TV journalist on a voyage around the United States, discovering American lives via interviews that often derail or become awkward due to his apparent foreignness. His real- life interviews reveal the cultural inconsistencies, classism, racism, sexism, religious bigotry in modern society, an image that's often ironed out so its 'best view' is on display in cinema etc.That said, 'Borat' just isn't very good comedy. His acting chops are great, and there's clearly a number of memorable situations, but I personally only actually laughed two or three times during the film. It seems like the daring, no-holds-barred nature of the comedy and its underlying social critique are what film critics held up as great comedy, regardless of its actual humor value.With a title like 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' and such an almost-iconic character that Cohen created for this picture, I very much wanted to like the film, but felt it often reveled in awkwardness and bad taste rather than any deeper sociological comedy. Commendably the film does put in a very touching moment on the senselessness of war, also the film makes some point about the inherent 'not-grown-up-ness' of popular culture. Much is made of the films 'mercilessly un-PC' approach, but to be honest I just thought the jokes were kind of gross.",6,0,1,6 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," wtf??
","You have to put it all in context for this movie; the original Star Wars trilogy was one of the biggest kids marketing successes of Hollywood history, if not the biggest, depending on how myopic you are regarding science fiction fandom. Obviously, in case you didn't know, numerous characters, settings and concepts were lifted from Isaac Asimov's 'Foundation' trilogy, and there are similarities to Akira Kurasawa's films also, but basically the original series looked and felt 100% original due to the concept art of Ralph McQuarrie. People will disagree with that statement, but seriously, if you look at his concept designs and scene paintings, they contain pretty much all the key scenes that were so memorable in the original series.The public probably didn't really want or expect another trilogy, but when it was announced that it was in production, everyone was, like, 'Hell yeah, I'll buy a ticket', by which I mean pretty much half the planet. The problem was that Ralph McQuarrie didn't want to come back to do the design work, and the late nineties CGI efforts looks airless, over-complicated and fake.Well hang on, the movie looks good in promo stills (that said, so do frames from Michael Bay's Transformers pictures), but the actual cast telling the story in Star Wars Episode I is pure vanilla. Where the original series launched the career of Harrison Ford into the big time, this movie pretty much killed Liam Neeson's career for a decade or more. This is an actual quote on the craft of acting from the Guardian newspaper two weeks before the films openingQUOTE 'Honest to God, I don't want to do it any more.' Neeson appears as Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars, Episode 1: the Phantom Menace, which opens in the US in a fortnight. He blamed the industry generally for his decision. 'Film is a director's medium; it has nothing to do with actors,''We are basically puppets, walking around, hitting marks, saying lines. Producers make all the money, and you get the sense that they hate actors.' UNQUOTEAlso, Ewen McGregor said the movie pretty much sucked but later withdrew his statement, probably for financial reasons.The film sold HEAPS of tickets, but no-one can actually relate the plot back afterward; essentially a princess is in the middle of a trade embargo and is secretly moving supplies to the green planet of Naboo to arm locals for an incursion against the galactic empire, but the story is hard to follow and typically the set design engulfs the acting on screen. Natalie Portman's acting is completely flat, and others talk in pseudo-heroic British theater accents to sound 'chivalrous', rather than using the natural expression of their voices. Part of the problem also stems from excessive scenes with characters interacting with CGI characters, CGI props and CGI backdrops.The main problem is the lack of ace McQuarrie designs from the original, while there's a lot of spaceships and robots on display, they all seem flimsy, insectile or horribly overstated. There's a great pod racer sequence featuring Darth Vader as an 8 year old (or something?? How come C3P0 and R2D2 know who Skywalker's real father is? Isn't this the worst plot hole in a major film ever? Possibly). Um, yeah - there's an ace pod racer sequence with lots of great angles and CGI machinery design, but as usual its so slick and airless that once you get over the initial buzz of seeing a slick chase sequence, there's little reason to go back and re-watch it, because the characters don't really sink in and as I mentioned, the plot outline is a mystery due to poor writing and exposition.A lot of people hated on Jar-Jar Binks, a racist stereotype of an incompetent Jamaican/tribal character that provides unfunny pratfalls and talks in gibberish. Star Wars was always something of a white anglo-Saxon fantasy, but there had never been so many unflattering Asian stereotypes, nor Jamaican stereotypes in earlier episodes of 'Star Wars'. Essentially Lucas fell for the trap of making the stupid, incompetent character a foreigner, and numerous bad guys foreigners, while the heroes are cod-Brits.After he'd killed Star Wars, Lucas left the series. I can't say honestly that he can direct, much less write a great movie anymore. (Howard the Duck??). He was a very bright star in seventies cinema, a progressive decade filled with great films, now just a rich old fool. If you're wondering, he was obsessed with sci-fi comics and car engines as a kid, which may have influenced the original Star Wars aesthetic, but just to kick his audience in the teeth for caring, he wrote the Episode I script himself and it's sheer pulp toilet paper. With these kinds of movies, if kids aren't responding positively you've definitely missed the mark.",3,2,6,21 September 2015
Citizen Kane," Powerful drama, fast paced
","Citizen Kane is a great movie, a first of its kind to include a novelistic character arc, depth, scope and technical innovations that hadn't been so successfully directed previously, although given that hundreds of thousands of films were produced throughout the 20th Century, the claim that Kane is the 'greatest movie of all time' is just glowing hyperbole.But is the film really good? Yep. Follows the story of an impoverished child that lucks out with a land deed that makes him a super-wealthy industrialist (a plutocrat, really) and owner of multiple newspapers, he's a media tycoon and philanthropist who's designs for nationwide (global?) power and influence are bought down by the sensationalistic media and personality politics that he himself had made a lions share of his fortune from.The acting is strong, every scene and sentence either moves the plot forward or develops character - if only Hollywood movies these days could follow these two concepts without digressing into pointless CGI 'franchise' movies that infantalize their audience and dazzle them with computer rendered frames that the brain unconsciously recognizes as fake anyway, but besides all that, Kane is a movie about a seemingly real man, and an era: the American century.I don't subscribe to the notion of American exceptionalism, and am not actually American at all (even if I did live there, I wouldn't consider myself) but the film is really about the birth of a culturally, and economically new power apart from 'the old country', with new values, new leaders and new forms of equality and mass media. The film also explores the inherent contradictions and hypocrisies of the new ruling class of the 20th century; Kane goes from being a genuinely useful idealist, to being an obscenely wealthy fool, trying to dignify the lot of the working class (his own social roots) by pushing a music retail clerk and mediocre stage singer to the level of stardom through his own great wealth and media influence. You can see parallels to today's society in every sequence of Citizen Kane, and its worth seeing more than once.",10,6,8,15 October 2015
The Babadook," Excellent spooky thriller with good production values
","This is a great film - directed and written by Jennifer Kent using, in part I believe, a city arts grant in Adeleide after some experience working on a Lars Von Trier film. The Babadook lives up to its critical praise with excellent pacing, camera-work, style, suspense and character development.The picture follows the aftermath of a widowed, down-at-the-heels care worker and her dysfunctional son, who are both being stalked, and invaded, by an evil creature from a children's book. The evil spirit, known as 'the Babadook' is sort of a homage to twenties German expressionist horror, and the overall tone is at times similar to the Shining, or the Exorcist.In fact, a few key scenes are overly derivative of those classic films, but its undeniable that Kent knows how to craft just enough suspense, foreboding, and helplessness to create a genuinely remarkable film. Its not without blood and violence, of course, but the film keeps these elements offscreen, or to a minimum, focussing on psychological terror and, well, darkness.This film only shows its limited budget in terms of its small cast, as the delivery and cinematography are all first rate, every camera move and editing sequence feels like the work of a quality filmmaker. Worth watching, although not if you're overly 'afraid of scary movies.'The writer/director also offers signed copies of the haunted book from the films official website if you are a fan of this movie.",8,5,10,11 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," IP, holiday release, junk movie
","A pointless, unoriginal film with bad pacing, zero stakes conflict, flat dialogue, a borrowed ending from a well established cinema classic, weak score (somehow) and a massive rush of VFX and quick cuts that fail to generate drama, adrenaline, pathos, really anything - the film fails to connect emotionally and seems to occur at arms length from the viewer.The story also fails badly due to a lot of Elm Street style 'fantasy' confrontation between characters in different locations, and a Michael Bay inspired series of endless explosions and wide screen shots of fake scenery without a dramatic setup or powerful characterization. Most/many secondary characters die, then come back to life. Main antagonist has been killed and bought back to life previously also, making this eighth sequel his second onscreen death, repeated purely to suggest some legitimacy about this fairly disposable good-vs-evil VFX release. Star Wars has largely been a disappointing failure since 1983, and this entry confirms the lack of quality in the highly marketable visual production series.",3,9,15,29 December 2019
Man of Steel," Zack Snyder is snot
","This film was given the major release treatment by corporate Hollywood upon its release: ad banners online, merchandise, large bus-stop ads and whatnot. Its just that, unfortunately, Zack Snyder couldn't tell a decent story if someone put a gun against his head and threatened to blow up the White House seventeen times.What actually happens is this: (no ending spoilers!) Superman's home planet is in crisis, being destroyed and so, as Clark Kent, Supermanmanman must go to Earth, live as a human, but also deal with his superhuman abilities and ultimately get in a big 'monster-mash' type battle with some dark clad extra-terrestrial superheros stolen from the 1980 film Superman 2.Things Zack Snyder does not have: any sense of realism or restraint for his CG/visual effects sequences that are all overblown and therefore become meaningless. Any idea of what character interiority or naturalistic dialogue feels like. Any idea of structure for a compelling story. Any idea of depth.That above paragraph has terrible syntax, in the hope that Snyder himself will bumble across this review, with his lumbering, crass tattoos and total lack of self awareness or intelligence and be all, like 'hey, I just took the most popular, obvious film making formula of the last twenty years and screwed it up, totally. I'm practically a walking kick-me sign for middlebrow American failure and macho stupidity'.Anyway, all that aside folks, what's really wrong with MANOFSTEEL specifically is that the main protagonist's grungy background is given depth purely through things like color grading, not actual drama - also his step father dies in a natural disaster with zero recognition after the fact, and then Kents 'space daddy' played by ruddy, hard nosed Russell Crowe (obviously no relation) keeps re- appearing conveniently as a 'hologram' after he'd actually died in the stories opening sequences on Krypton - making the sacrifice and dramatic weight of the issue meaningless.But what about the superhero action sequences? Crap. Basically expensive computer rendered CG shows completely overblown battle sequences between the super super powered men-in-tights as they throw buses, smash thousands of bricks, sh*t fire etc. You can't have real dramatic tension when the characters are seemingly invincible, as numerous 'mainstream' reviewers pointed out on the release of this massive turkey. Speaking of turkey, the whole 'serious, earnest' vibe that MANOFSTEEL is supposed to have is enforced through color grading and artificial grain throughout - as if Snyder and co. could imitate the gravitas of the Dark Knight series by just removing color saturation etc, ie: the sort of thing you can do on some smart phones these days.",2,4,7,2 January 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," 'big' CGI movie with technical issues, lack of central character
","Peter Jackson, now referred to as 'Sir Peter Jackson' initially didn't want to do the Hobbit story idea, but later proposed 'the Hobbit' as a three picture story arc. Incidentally, at the first film opening he stated that he hadn't actually seen a finished edit of the picture and as people found out in following months, the movie was a massive disappointment compared to the New Line franchise he directed a decade earlier.This sequel is intended to a be a return to form, but it's still a disappointing movie, largely for two reasons; firstly because Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and the other main players here just don't seem to know who, or what the main character is about very much, and because they don't the audience doesn't feel terribly involved either. Bilbo Baggins, the central character, never feels pivotal to the story, doesn't feel either like a leader or a hero or even much like a pitiable victim in the movies numerous set pieces.The second reason is because the film is fundamentally flawed in the way its produced and distributed. Audiences wearing grey 3D glasses lose color value, and an attempt to restore the proper luminance in 3D theaters led the film company to release the movie at twice the standard frame rate; as a result, makeup, costume detail, and background elements look obviously fake, instead of the magical, poetic sequences that made the original films such great entertainment.The script feels like well-combed fan fiction, which suggests that, really, 'the Hobbit' should have been one powerful, lyrical sort of movie that recreates the vibe from the original Lord of the Rings environment, and remains faithful to the source material. It feels a bit pointless explaining this but the idea of a dragon guarding gold under a mountain has been a staple of European folklore mythology long before Tolkien created 'the Hobbit'. If you get to the end of this movie, as suggested in the trailers, the dragon is a massive and spectacular beast, but doesn't save this picture from the feeling that its illogical, over-padded and overproduced. I guess the best you can say about the trilogy is that it actually got completed, despite the fact that it's clearly impossible to create a worthwhile product with zero pre-production schedule. The film system and the projects handlers are to blame for it's poor quality as much as Jackson's bloated ideas about 'running length' . . .",5,10,14,10 November 2014
Batman Begins," Nothing Happens
","I have reservations for how good this film actually is for three reasons: firstly, despite all the great actors in the film the experience is emotionally unmoving and visually rather conservative. Lastly, the film is somewhat hampered by creating key urban sequences on an interior sound stage.The movie does check all the right boxes for telling a decent story though; heaps of back-story, character subtext, little motifs about childhood trauma and alienation that fuel the idea that Batman (could be) an interesting film character. Unfortunately, the success of Sam Raimi's first two Spiderman films pretty much created an endless (often pointless) superhero re-tread economy. This movie genuinely tries something different, with more dialogue, a more cosmopolitan outlook and more real-world issues than hi-tech Marvel fluff. I was left largely unimpressed upon the initial viewing of Batman Begins; its not really quite a grown up film, nor is it a stylish fantasy film. Its sort of a crime drama with a guy appearing as Batman for a handful of scenes. The excellent (and not-to-be-missed) sequel The Dark Knight was one of the most successful films of the decade, making the back-story chapters here seem reasonable in hindsight, not that you need to see this film to understand that one.Oh, yeah - what's it about? Um, Bruce Wayne is trapped in a third world labour prison in the snow somewhere in southeast Asia, a group of terrorists from the region plan to attack Gotham with toxic gas that incites terror and maybe crash into some big buildings so Bruce, as Batman, must figure out their plans and stop them from doing so. Pretty good score, but like the set-design, it pales in comparison to Tim Burtons over-hyped 1989 film. Christoper Nolans film is more like a book come to life, whereas Tim Burtons movie was more like a marketing phenomenon based around impressive art direction and bubblegum. (Literally: bubblegum, the trading cards were omnipresent at the time). Thankfully Christopher Nolan actually has a brain, and treats his audience in the same way but doesn't really hit the narrative stride and excitement that the much-loved character deserves till the next movie.",7,4,8,18 July 2005
Bridesmaids," Effortlessly hilarious, great characterization
","Bridesmaids is a hilarious piece of social realist comedy; behind the dull patina of day-to-day suburban life for a group of Midwestern women is a constant stream of fearless, hilarious one liners. Mainstream critics largely applauded the film also, for building up it's sense of character arc and having a bit of comedic depth, the film celebrates the diverse identities of modern American women, and the casting is excellent.As with most funny comedies, Bridesmaids riffs on a relatable theme. Central character Annie Walker is in her late thirties, driving a bombed-out second hand car, depressed, incapable of finding a decent relationship, and already has a few age wrinkles. Her lifelong friend is getting married and Annie's stricken with jealousy because her lifelong (read: former high- school) friend is basically being stolen by an American socialite trophy wife; a young, attractive second partner to an anonymous businessman who's away from home most of the time.BE AWARE: virtually ALL Hollywood films feature a male protagonist, with female cast members appearing only to react to or enable a plot point in relation to the central male ego that the narrative serves. In Bridesmaids, the leads are all female, and the male characters mostly exist unseen or somewhere else in the story. The film goes a tad sentimental in the closing scenes, ending as all such films do, with a romantic conclusion - Bridesmaids isn't really about romance though, more the idea of life's failures and a type of crass, caustic humor that's very funny because of it's disarming honesty.",8,1,1,23 July 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Warners headed remake, soulless and overproduced
","Smug mega-nerd Peter Jackson and co have decided to avoid the source material all together in favour of making three-hour installments of crude humor, overdressed cast members, over-designed backdrops and massive, complex action sequences that all look, and feel, like computer game cinematics created by Blur Studios, complete with virtual camera moves and impressive but utterly unrealistic narrative. At no point does the Hobbit really fit into the piece, he doesn't even like the dwarfs, nor want to go on an adventure with them. The basic dramatic tension between him, the dwarfs, the elves and the orcs never has any feeling or emotion and the last shot is a set up for a sequel instead of a story ending. Ironically, it's a type of overproduced b-grade trash that you'd think you'd see from New Line or the old Canon Group company. An impressive movie visually, but forgettable, mishandled and meaningless. In my humble opinion, the Pixar writers and and directors should have been brought in to improve the material, as many of the 'acting' scenes in this long-form computer graphics movie feel extraneous or empty. Lastly, I object to this films exclusively white male cast and narrative, and the fact that the New Zealand public contributed nearly 200 million dollars in tax relief for the Warners production to be made in their trade territory, despite mixed reviews and the overall impression that it ruined enthusiasm for the older classic pictures. The New Zealand public also faces a housing crisis and mounting homelessness due to opportunistic immigration policies and other serious issues due to earthquake damage. Coughing up incentives for wealthy Hollywood producers is hardly a shared priority.",4,2,3,2 June 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," FX galore, plastic script
","This movie has thousands of visual effects shots - and except for a few tiny moments, they are all designed, rendered and composited very professionally. You can't get much better.But now for the bad part - I always had reservations that Disney corp. would make superhero films neutered of real menace, too franchise-ey and too polished/bland and that, in effect, is what's wrong with the film.The script is frequently tone-deaf, as in totally unrelated to the onscreen action or dramatic conflict, which was an issue with previous entries, and the overstuffed 'Civil War' (this film's ending is ripped from Birth of a Nation, but so are hundreds of titles in the action/adventure/fantasy genre). Basically, the best parts of the film are supposed to be balls-out breathless action sequences between the Marvel hero's cast and Thanos, a demon-like intergalactic warrior, except Disney, in all it's marketing 'wisdom', rob ALL the action scenes of drama with inappropriate, flat 'quips' to carefully telegraph to parents that this is just a 'fun movie' with nothing more at stake than a bit of fun and some wiz-bang VFX. That, in a nutshell, is what's wrong with the film - in an attempt to please an audience who are increasingly exhausted from forty-five previous sequels in the tights-and-CGI genre, they put EVERYTHING into the movie from the Marvel comics canon, but then rob the movie of any real charm or menace with an awful script. Isolated scenes throughout play really well, but whenever the movie's supposed to hit overdrive and turn into a real 'ride', the dialogue is annoyingly lame. I rate the film at a 'six' instead of a 'three' because of the artful VFX, backdrops, sci-fi props and digital camera moves.Oh - I forgot to mention; the bad guys plan is super-lame also! Great animation, great costume, great backdrop. Lame dramatic goal, therefore the entire film is tainted with an undying lameness that you can't quite shake off, no matter how much key scenes impress. Worth pirating, if you can push a few buttons and it's raining outside . . .",6,2,12,30 April 2018
Gone Girl," Rated R. For Ridiculous.
","Gone Girl focuses on the bizarre and destructive plans of a sociopathic children's author, plotting to frame her hated, philandering husband for murder by disappearing, and then possibly doing herself in or committing unspeakable crimes on the lam.This film should be commended for the sheer amount of characterization, the realistic (ie: suburban, drab) production values and the sheer amount of story detail and facts included in the story. It really has content, or strives to, over sheer filmic style and none of the, you know, computerized special effects, which are the modern hallmark of Corporate Hollywood.The film is also, however, totally ridiculous. As if someone had strived to synthesize Silence of the Lambs with an old fashioned Hitchcock thriller (Vertigo, anyone?) and the results were unintentionally funny.Not just a crime thriller, but also a marital drama, something of a horror pic and there's an ongoing (ultimately repetitive, and annoying) parallel story about local newsmongers framing events, putting sensationalist spin on the disappearance/unsolved crime and of course all kinds of assumptions about gender roles and marital abuse. About 60 percent of screen-time is dedicated to stock procedural scenes of police and journalist types mulling through clues, interview accounts, photos and literally bags of trash to get details on missing kids author Amy Dunne.This film is TRASHY - every other scene is packed with sex, foul language and gratuitous crime drama details, somehow the whole affair seems palatable due to the mature, nuanced dialogue and the ever present 'realism' via hand held shots, underexposed color and suburban drabness.As I mentioned, the film is dedicated to a realist aesthetic, but ultimately, the movie just doesn't know how to end itself - I won't spoil any details, but clearly Fincher and co. thought Gone Girl's antagonist was just too interesting for justice, which is what the audience actually wants. Basically I don't recommend this film as essential viewing. It goes for two and half hours, and after sitting through extensive plot twists and character reveals concludes in an incomprehensible ending, leaving you wondering how you ever bought into the films absurd premise and muddy plot motivations. Gone Girl is a character driven movie with an ending that sucks.",6,8,17,28 October 2014
Ghostbusters," Greatest 80s movie of the 80s - thankfully doesn't look too 80s.
","This movie was a huge commercial success when it opened, partly because it mixed big budget visual effects with small scale human comedy, but also because the perfectly cast and designed Ghostbusters created such a memorable impression that audiences seemingly had the movie etched on their consciousness for decades afterward.Ghostbusters follows basic comedy plot tropes, broadly speaking; when three unsuccessful parapsychologists are removed from their campus, they face the reality of starting a business in a competitive, uncaring world. In doing so, they offer to capture ghosts with high end industrial lasers, and along the way, lovable goof-ball Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) falls in love with Dana Barrett, a concert cellist who initially rejects him.The movie effortlessly combines sci-fi with horror, fantasy, comedy and romance elements, and no element ever feels out of place or at odds with the underlying structure. The films classy, almost fifties retro visual style has weathered well, and László Kovács classic cinematography is put to good use in the films various comic set ups and large scale visual effects set pieces, as is Elmer Bernstein's classic score. What's little known about the film is that a T.V. series from the seventies 'The Ghost Busters' already existed a decade earlier, although unrelated to the film except in name only, also some of the visual effects appear to be an extension of the effects created for the 1982 movie Poltergeist.Ultimately, the cast of Ghostbusters have gone on to do other things, although internet fandom has made noise about a new film for a decade or more, but none has actually come to light. Plans for a female-led Ghostbusters installment are in the works, but really, who cares? It would mean more to create something new and challenging, but the temptation to rework a successful franchise is too much for the for-profit investment model associated with Hollywood filmmaking.That said, for all of the fans/collectors/geeks/obsessives who love Ghostbusters, its official sequel from 1989 is flat in terms of fantasy OR comedy material, and its also surprising how many utterly hopeless films have been made with the names 'Ivan Reitman' or 'Dan Ackroyd' attached to them in the passing decades.",9,4,6,12 January 2015
Mulholland Drive," excellent film on many levels
","After 'Lost Highway', a crime/romantic betrayal story punctuated by pretentious meta-narrative and probably very nearly containing Rob Zombie tunes at one point, Lynch came back a few years later with this picture, easily his most absorbing, memorable and emotionally satisfying reworking of the crime/romance theme since he established his presence with 'Blue Velvet' decades ago.Mulholland Drive features Betty, a wholesome, suburban wannabe actress vacationing in Hollywood at her wealthy aunts apartment, who's working out of town on a movie. A voluptuous, olive skinned woman appears to be cowering in the apartment, dazed with concussion. The rest of the film is in essence a series of vignettes and spiralling, increasingly angst-ridden scenes showing Betty's manipulation and betrayal by Rita, who appears to be either a Hollywood socialite or possibly a sex worker with dangerous criminal connections.Laura Harring plays Rita's character perfectly, a previous national beauty pageant winner, Harring was also hit in the skull in a traumatizing bullet wound incident as a child. The films dramatic core is about the shifting character dynamic from naive friendship to lesbian manipulation and romantic failure.The second element to Mulholland Drives success is the age-old theme of 'seedy show-business'; a class of wealthy, corrupt film producers are shown in cahoots with organized crime, who in turn are in cahoots with common street criminals. While the concept is nothing new due to Hollywoods historic ties with the Mafia during its golden age, Lynch's typical combination of mystery, melodrama and fascinatingly strange symbolism make this film one of the best pictures of its decade.",8,0,0,29 April 2016
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Remake of an early 70's kids classic . . .
","Tim Burton has a heart of cardboard - can his friend Johnny Depp save him in this 'dark' children's remake about consumerism? Dunno bro, ask Batman!! That sucked too, especially in the 'plot' department. This movie is worth seeing for some attractive set design, ostentatious costumes and Danny Elfman's energetic, whimsical-yet-gothic musical approach. Parts of this film break down in to MTV style music video montage, which is another sign of how shallow and distracting Burton is as a creative force, and storyteller. He has made some SOME great films, but this is like half of one, in a sense. I enjoyed the CG furry animals though!",6,1,2,28 January 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Portentous, Pretentious, Prescient sci-fi movie, foregrounds themes over character
","According to some, this is THE greatest science fiction cinema of all time - and frankly, if you don't like science fiction, you might like this movie anyway since it isn't really science fiction.Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubricks story is more of a naval gazing, beard stroking summation of evolution, the quest for spiritual and physical transcendence, and a mystified, though emotionally effecting exploration of intelligible sources of 'higher power', or cosmic intelligence in the universe. According to the writers of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that source has been there since the cradle of civilization, transmitting messages that are, to us, signposts of evolutionary development; shown in the opening sequences of the film as the first instance of primitive tool use among our ancestors.Needless to say, a major studio film as abstract, vastly ambitious, and frequently empty as 2001 could only be a product of the 60's era pseudo-spirituality. Also, the movies advanced concept of sci-fi production design was hugely influential on decades of sci-fi film, television and fantasy art, but aside from that, the actual 'science' part of the story is boringly slow, features no remarkable human actors and doesn't really engage the audience with the promise suggested in the powerful opening sequences.It appears, in addition to the massive 'super-theme' (read: sci-fi influenced religious narrative), that Arthur C Clarke and his equally bespectacled co-writer Kubrick include a secondary story about the possibility of highly advanced, seemingly self aware computers, that communicate with the human characters in the 'story' while carrying out technical mission assistance during space travel.The movie is VERY slow, and it reverberates with the viewer afterward, as it shows a link between our largely geometric, four sided culture and intellectual advancement and the involvement of a powerful, though not entirely comprehensible alien force over the millenia. A fascinating theme, and a very well made film for its time, though basically so cold, ambiguous and leaden-paced that it feels like a task actually getting through. You could add at this point that the merit of a film is maybe not its entertainment value, but its commitment to realism, the intelligence of its themes and its sheer innovation (the film was staggeringly made back in 1967, looks decades ahead of time in terms of believable technology etc). This might be why critics make such elevated claims about the film. Basically, if you've ever wondered about intelligible life hundreds of millions of light years from our planet (everybody has), then this film deals with that subject, though in a way that treats the subject with consideration and depth that was unusual for science fiction cinema of its day.",9,2,4,17 May 2015
Pride & Prejudice," Excellent remake of a remade remake.
","The lighting, costume design and art direction alone make this film a standout, but also the cinematography and editing match the material and make this 'timeless' film highly entertaining.In Joe Wright's high-end retelling of the story, a young woman at the lowest, and most economically vulnerable end of the landed gentry of early 1800's England, must find a suitable partner. The man she finds is basically a total asshat, but as the plot unfolds, it's revealed that the negative allegation's made against him aren't actually true, and although his family would forbid it, he's prepared to transcend the class structure of his era for 'pure love'.Keira Knightley is effortlessly beautiful in every scene, even when she falls in the mud or throws a tantrum, she basically grits into a photogenic grimace, and her 'petulant' look somewhat betrays the underlying entitlement of the actress.The weather is perfect in every scene though and every prop, costume piece, window frame and even sagging, unappealing street view looks like a work of art.The film's romantic core is something of a contradiction; ultimately, Bennett is a sexually attractive woman of lower social standing and the pompous, self-regarding Mr Darcy that loves her has a lot of money and property - making the plot seem somewhat more like a marriage of material gain rather than anything remotely revolutionary.Regardless, generations of new readers pick up Jane Austin's classics, although as a newcomer you can be left wondering a little as to what readers see in their literary hero's concept; Austin's story is essentially a film about a women's lack of self-determination in an era before any real political and labor representation, and the film wallows in the pretensions and resentments of Britain's entrenched class system of yore. Thank god for the Sex Pistols.",8,1,1,27 August 2016
Joker," Film-maker makes film inspired by much better film-makers
","Two points: Comic Book movies are overplayed, as non-union CGI 'teams' pipeline the shots and the company makes off with most of the money.Second point: Joker is NOT a CGI/superhero type movie! It's a 'drama' about a loner who's gritty, depressive, troubled life leads to accidental freak acts of urban violence; the alienated counterculture (who in this case, are not liberal-democratic progressives, but basically nihilistic alt.right losers) cheer him on.Needless to say, the film is 'daring' for confronting the vast income divide, alienation and random violence in American life in 2019. Now for the the reason I give the movie six out of ten: I'M NOT A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD!! I've already seen the outstanding film King of Comedy, which is just wonderful, and many, many film critics have plastered analysis, superlatives and screen shots from Taxi Driver in magazines everywhere. Interviews where Joaquin Phoenix claims there was 'no mention of these films during production' or 'no intentional references in the movie' are just polite lies. The film is NOT original, despite it's retro genre styling and the fact that it is basically repellent, signalling to auds that this is a (bleurgghh!) comic-book movie that isn't afraid to totally break with commercial conventions.Is the film great? No. It's narrow, manipulative and secondary characters get occasionally lazy narrative threads. Is Phoenix good? YES - he does some weird stuff, like getting into a fridge, or doing a little interpretive dance in a grimy public bathroom near a subway. The main reason this film is selling well is lack of important material during it's release date.",6,3,6,13 October 2019
A Hard Day's Night," Excellent record, OK movie
","I'm not here to tell you that, hey, the Beatles are one of the most successful pop/rock groups of all time and that they actually sucked; I realize that the album that the film promotes is nearly flawless, its pretty much a template for every pop/rock album promoted since, but the film just didn't click with me personally.The main problem is that it constantly employs a standard comedy approach, where the Beatles are young northerners, outsiders representing the youth audience, and in each sequence they outsmart or out-cool the establishment, basically anyone that appears wealthier than them, or in a position of power - its much the same routine as Ivan Reitmans later 'Ghostbusters' picture, if anyone notices.My other issue with the film is that the group don't really appear as themselves, but as slangy, Northern teenagers; they typify a youth culture that they've actually outgrown. The film is for the bands audience, rather than people interested in the band themselves.I like the idea of comedy, rather than an earnest series of interview segments, and this movie was a massive commercial hit (they were the biggest act in the world at the time), but I found the experience oddly thin and disappointing. Some great use of camera and editing though, which had an influence on the coming of music video.",6,1,2,5 October 2015
Bram Stoker's Dracula," High-end Vampire myth, still just about sex and blood.
","I can't help but get the feeling that critics gave Coppola the benefit of the doubt with so many curiosities in this wide release film, he was of course a much lauded director and just putting his name on the film poster was sure to get asses on seats at the local multiplex.It should be noted that in the early nineties, Oliver Stone's movie the Doors, the deplorably bad Natural Born Killers and of course Bram Stoker's Dracula were all completely overblown in their production design and editing - as if these talented filmmakers had given in to the misguided idea that smothering the narrative in distracting effects and post production tricks would appeal to audiences, rather than confuse them.Dracula is actually a pretty good example of the genre (if 'totally overproduced early nineties movie' is a genre) in that many of Eiko Ishioka's costume designs are strikingly bizarre or beautiful, the sets are stuffed with opulent Gothic and Victorian decoration, and of course Anthony Hopkins is great as Dr Van Helsing, a remorseless dutch Dr and metaphysician of his time, trying to rid the world of the Nosferatu, played by Gary Oldman.The main problem with this film's 'ambitious set design' is that it's so often distracting. Some viewers could be wondering why in the films preamble, 15th century Romanian warriors are wearing bizarre red suits of plastic and leather that look nothing remotely suited to the era. The period costumes actually resemble science fiction items from Mario Bava's 1965 film Planet of the Vampires. The heavy religious imagery and chiaroscuro lighting add an impressive renaissance flavor also, but my main complaint is that the ingredients don't really create a convincing narrative whole. The very set-bound and design-oriented nature of the film is impressive, but not convincing.Coppola's intent of course is that it's all visual prosody, i.e: that the film's endless special effects and overstated design are riffing on themes of blood letting, mortality, repression, lust, venereal disease and the corrupt, horrible evil of some ancient ruling class. Good idea, but its all too flashy to truly sink in.The special effects are frequently excellent, as Count Dracula in this picture appears as a person of different physical ages, he casts no reflection, he is a familiar of wolves and bats, and can turn into wolves and bats, also he appears sometimes as a hideous writhing humanoid bat of about seven feet in height. Sometimes he appears as a sickly green fog. You get the idea: in almost EVERY shot in this film, there are visual effects, but also Coppola gives into the temptation to add wacky editing techniques including bits of sped up and slowed down film to create a very opulent period picture that frequently looks like a music video. Ultimately, the film is about two things: lavish production design and sleazy, erotic encounters showing vampire mistresses or Victorian ladies on the verge of orgasm with vampires. It could be a 'comment' on Victorian sexuality, but more likely its just sleaze for the sake of sleaze, titillating the audience in much the same way that cheap teen comedies of the era liked to depict tall, naked legs or plunging breast shots on the VHS cover. My last issue, as so many raised in 1992 is that Keanu Reeves isn't exactly suited for Gothic material. His previous two hits, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Point Break were teen-oriented summertime movies, and while he has on screen sex appeal, his character Jonathan Harker would have benefited greatly from a quality actor, like say Daniel Day Lewis, who could make a realistic effort of the required accent for the part and most importantly his emotive skill would be the focus area of a given scene, two things that Reeves just isn't really capable of.",7,1,2,18 June 2016
Straight Outta Compton," Excellent drama, unrealistically violent
","This is a well made drama, with an excellent cast, genuine depth and a powerful ending. Now for the not-so-great part: the makers of the film seem more interested at times in creating a filmic version of N.W.A's sensationalistic, violent music than authentically portraying the lives of the people in the group. That said, the film opened with record setting opening weekend sales, which is really something for a legacy hip hop group, and one that has a pretty selective audience.For those too young or just too polite to know, N.W.A. sort of 'broke down the boundaries' for offensive, sexist, hardcore street rap, partly spearheading the Gangsta Rap controversy of the early 90's. What that actually means in terms of studio recordings often boils down to old Funkadelic tracks (Funkentelechy Vs The Placebo Syndrome, anyone?) with expletive laden raps over the top - middle class white kids get off on the danger and power fantasy of gangsta rap etc, while major label record companies made off with millions.Is it exploitative? Definitely, but also N.W.A. really did come from Compton (or pretty close to, anyway), and the film details their beginnings recording in rough neighbourhoods and playing dive bars to their later career, mentored by a middle aged Jewish-American music industry professional called Jerry Heller, who hid financial details from the group, both promoting them and ripping them off at the same time.Discriminatory racial profiling, police harassment, and gang activity are all played out in a harsh, realistic style of combining hand- held shots, expert editing and a concise script. The casual sexism, nudity and obnoxiousness of commercial hip hop culture might be a bit tiresome for some; these people are actual adults but behave like overgrown 18 year olds themselves at times.Two points: the film actually has dramatic power rather than sentiment, eschewing Hollywood gloss for a 'real, in the moment' feel, but also there's a LOT of scenes in which estranged performers and dodgy record industry types get straight-up punched senseless on camera. It almost seems like the writers have included multiple scenes regarding the groups mismanagement and infighting to push the story forward, but it hardly seems realistic the sheer number of times people get angrily dealt to; even Dre, the most clean cut and work-focused of the group, apparently beats the crap out of people just for partying and making noise while he's recording. I highly doubt stuff this crazy actually happened so frequently, while at the same time the pertinent and very serious issue of wealthy producer and headphone sponsor Dre assaulting three women as a youngster is conveniently removed from history altogether. Last thoughts: see this movie, its got a great character arc and some powerful themes that fall well outside of the standard rap bio narrative. Rated for nudity and strong language, I guess.",8,4,30,5 October 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," excellent performances, great writing
","Silence of the Lambs is a psychological thriller that positions its most dangerous (and interesting) character in a prison cell for much of the screen time, so his character can be shown through intuitions, subtext, hindsight narrative and general creepiness.That character is Anthony Hopkins as 'Hannibal Lecter', a cultured psychiatrist imprisoned among psychiatric criminal scum who longs for decent human contact or escape, except he himself has a history of killing people and eating the mutilated parts.All of this is described off-screen, and the film doesn't indulge in unpleasant gore or cheap shock effects - the films main secondary character is Buffalo Bill, a man who applied for gender reassignment, but Lecter explains he was repeatedly denied on basis of his psychological profile. Due to repeated abusive childhood trauma, has become an anonymous, dysfunctional recluse who randomly assaults and kills women. Lecter suggests that his victimhood narrative contributes to his inhumane treatment of others, he drops other details and secrets about the killer but isn't fully cooperative about providing a complete psychological profile of the killer due to the indignity of his life in prison.Clarise Starling is an FBI rookie, chosen for her attractiveness, to get information from Hannibal Lecter on his former patient and contact Buffalo Bill. The reverse-symbolism of having Dr Lecter behind bars whilst Starling is just beyond them is a brilliant bit of staging, as much of the film's subtext is about the gender coding of behaviour, identity and social roles. Its also genuinely scary, but mostly on the level of dialogue and performance, Silence of the Lambs is rightly considered one of the best films of all time in the drama/thriller/psychological horror category, also the police procedural scenes are taut and realistic, or as realistic as you could expect. A second underlying theme of the piece is that the state ultimately protects its own interests, but is unable in the last instance to truly protect the public from crime.There is a 'happy ending' of sorts in the picture, in that Starling, a lone female FBI agent in a predominantly male service, overcomes a male aggressor mentally and physically. An empowering ending that's more of a relief than an actual closure.Silence of the Lambs is brilliant, but also the hubbub surrounding the films release and its subsequent awards greenlit some terrible sequels where this movie's lead, director and screenwriter didn't even contribute. Some audience members aren't aware but this film bares similarities to the previous Thomas Harris adaptation 'Manhunter', released as a film in 1986. Later films in the 'series' are a pointless cash-in on the famous character Anthony Hopkins embodies in this film.",9,3,6,1 May 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Badman vs Stupidman - Dawn of Darkness
","This film has no reason to exist.There's just no moral reason for the characters to be doing anything and Snyder (dir.) can't get any kind of connection between what's happening on screen and what's going on in peoples heads, let alone establish an emotional tone.The script has a good turn of phrase now and again, for sure, but the earnestness becomes unintentionally funny after a while, when you realize the entire film is preposterous. A combination of slick military propaganda and simplistic storytelling, the movies main enemies are a) Snyder's inability to make, feel, or create story ideas with a camera and written concepts, and secondly, criminally bad color grading, ruining acres of superior film craft, all professionally paid for and generally ignored or hated by the Comic Book Adaptation audience. (as if they have any choice, as there's hardly ever anything else on).Last point, to coin a clichÃ© - the film's dramatic power is often indexed by how effective or magnetic the bad guy is. Dark Knight had the excellent Heath Ledger. This movie has a smirking, shallow, annoying dick called Jesse Eisenberg, who should have had a bit part in the movie making sandwiches or something in the background of the films endless, grim and very adult fantasy settings of offices, mansions, cityscapes and war zones, all aimed at bored, disappointed kids wasting what little money they have anyway.I'd give this film a negative rating if the IMDb webmasters will set up such a function.",1,3,7,23 August 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 90% unoriginal, but emotionally powerful ending . . .
","This is the movie 'you've all been waiting for', a grand, classic early 80s Star Wars sequel complete with analogue grain, and the exact same music, credits, shots, battle sequences, characters, plot devices and themes.The movie also has some new spins, details and depth during the battle sequences, and luckily, it IS an emotionally powerful piece of drama, the third act is palpably effective.Is it worth seeing? Well, in the 35 years or whatever since Star Wars came to the screen, there's been a lot of developments in making stylized, fx-heavy violence and spaceship battles on screen, so the movie mostly relies on expensive modern production values that look convincingly like the original Star Wars universe. Also, the story beats happen faster, which in a sense rob depth of a fantasy series that didn't have much in the first place, and often the action sequences smack of frames and stand-offs from the old series.I DID SAY, however, that it has guts. The film feels real, and compelling, and has a sense of drama that relates to the real world, also its commendable that the film has a strong female lead and an African American dude is prominent throughout, although that's not in itself innovative in 2015, its still a nice idea to bring some diversity to the Star Wars franchise, also adds dramatic possibility, something George Lucas clearly had no grasp of in his 'prequel' trilogy launched in the late nineties.Anyway, writing about Star Wars is a bit like 'dancing about architecture' to borrow a Frank Zappa phrase on the role of critics, go see it: if you like Star Wars, you'll love this movie. Older viewers, or really anyone familiar with the early installations will occasionally wince at the fact that the movie is nearly entirely a clone of some sort - perhaps the first big reboot of a popular series that's really a note-for-note remake.Generally good acting though, and decent budget, as you'd expect from Disney/Lucasfilm megacorp.",8,5,20,17 December 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Classic horror title, more of an 80s teen fantasy movie.
","A Nightmare on Elm Street was created by Wes Craven, an English lit professor, who probably got the project green-lit because its so teen orientated, and plays on the idea of dream-reality invading our waking life in such an original way.The movie starts with an excellent plot conceit, local bad-boy (played by Johnny Depp) is accused of a crime he didn't commit. The real culprit? A scarred, cackling ghost, formerly a school caretaker that was burnt alive by vengeful Elm Street parents for abusing children.A Nightmare on Elm Street has a sense of purpose, context, and layered story elements the other films in this series lack, and that said, the movie is also the only 'Nightmare' film created by Wes Craven for the whole decade of numerically staggering hack-n-slash sequels. (Seven? Eight? Nine???) The decision to build this movies character into a 'franchise' is actually a symptom of how 80s cinema was overly commercial and a tad mindless compared to the 70s classics that film geeks and reviewers still laud today as quality cinema.That aside, the movie does have a sense of dread and insularity as the teens of Elm Street realize that they're trapped in a supernatural pact against the evil spirit of Freddy Krueger, and the special effects are pretty cool. The prosthetics, Jacques Haitkins cinematography and the pulsing 80s synthesizer score all became standard tropes for 80s big-league horror and its various low budget imitators where you gets stabbed in the eyeball by a guy in a hockey mask coming out of a closet in the dark etc. Bam!!! You got stabbed!! Ouch!!! EwwwwÂ….fake blood.Personally, I'd rate the film as a '6', but upped it a notch because of the excellent title!! Also, creature design effects for Freddy Krueger are some of the most iconic in horror history, that said most of the other releases in the series are just VFX vehicles with anonymous teens getting sliced and 'nightmare-ified'. Worth seeing, but would have been better off as a single movie.",7,1,1,11 January 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," Stylish indie film eschews plot in favor of plotlessness
","This is a great looking film, with typically sharp Wellington VFX and sumptuous, gritty goth set design, the film is obviously an attraction for local New Zealand (and Wellington) viewers, in the sense that it shows its cast in familiar locations for partying Wellingtonians, and the camera is focused on Wellington actors Waititi and Clement for about 90 percent of the screen time.What We Do in the Shadows is also a mixed genre film, something the film industry tends to reject, but can be done brilliantly with indie film, and frankly, the film never feels cheap or compromised, often using a kind of there-in-the-moment live camera feel, and improvised lines throughout.However, this film has limitations, and its ultimately a bit of a disappointment. The movie shows the lives of four overdressed vampires, intimately sharing their crazy lives and tribulations etc, but there's really no plot, and certainly nothing resembling a satisfying ending sequence. Clearly, there's plot points that a proper story development could pick out as suitable material for a third act here, for instance, when an archaic Nosferatu-lookalike vampire downstairs gets attacked by vampire hunters, but the event just passes as 'part of the story', as are plot threads about gang friction between vampires and werewolves, or some bathetic humor about Clements ex-girlfriend being a torment of some sort. Basically, this is a film where the characters are defined, then the acting is improvised; as a result the audience gives its time, but after a stylish opening, gets no substantial ending in return.'Shadows' is basically a series of comedy sketches about flatting life for teens, and I would rather see some comedy with a bit of scope or depth - Waititi comes across on screen as clean cut, fruity and lightweight, but never hilarious. I get the feeling he was more focused on the quality of his images, and the character dynamics than the actual gags, much less the story. Oh well.",6,2,11,10 November 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," mindless violence with harsh, survivalist set design
","There's an issue of sorts among Australian (and to an extent New Zealand) males about what masculinity is, what is means to be 'tough', 'resilient', 'fearless' etc in these post-colonial countries, and the complex can't be more feverishly illustrated than in 'Mad Max: Fury Road'.Also, I can't help but feel that the overwhelmingly positive newspaper reviews are more a reaction to the long-held discrimination of sexism in the US, as they insist over and over again that the film is 'brilliant', 'unforgettable', and 'must-see cinema', essentially because there's a bald-headed female warrior on the run from a tribe of barbarians, trying to protect females from a clan of deformed, repulsive mutants and skinhead freaks with guns.Although, yes, that is a noble reason to retool an action franchise, it was also done in the mid 80s by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (back when the original Mad Max trilogy was circulating in video rental stores), and actually the chief antagonist in Fury Road notably resembles the Predator from 1987 if you squint a little.So whats all the fuss about? Not sure really - MM:FR has a sense of black comedy to the essentially threatening undertones of the film, and some thoroughly awesome cinematography and production design regarding the vehicles, but it's essentially just a chase movie, and there's only so many ways you can frame a punch to the head, a wild leap from a moving vehicle or a screaming car crash until you realize the entire movies about trigger happy machismo (or whatever the femme equivalent of machismo is) and dangerously shot stunts - the film doesn't have any notable dialogue or character development at all.Apparently, if this is the new 'gold standard' for hard boiled action escapism, I have to say that it's a much better film in 2D than 3D; also DVD versions of the release appear to have one or two gross details removed, not that it detracts from the non-stop tension and ambitious prop design throughout.",7,7,13,22 June 2015
The Social Network," Manipulative corporate propaganda.
","DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!I'm serious - if you want to, I can't stop you, so here's the premise: Zuckerberg is an everyman and underdog, a grinning, charmless suburban geek that wants to 'change the world', by connecting people - the villains of the piece are US blue-blooded preppies that believe they are the rightful lead in a type of tech/social media platform race that becomes what we know of as Facebook.But what is Facebook? It's an omnipresent, surveillance-based global software that relies enormously on the sharing of 'content' for which it, nor consumers ever pay. This film, although handled with excellent balance and dramatic treatment, and no shortage of wit, seems to make no mention of the fact that our best journalists, artists, musicians, documentarians, animators and designers are paid nothing ($0.00) for a media sharing platform that earns nearly 40 billion dollars a year in revenue, and directs United States government policy-making, and collects all your personal data for marketing algorithms and public surveillance.The image of Zuckerberg in his hooded sweater grinning naively with a soft-drink in hand is actually the sound of the Western arts and media economy being flushed down the toilet, and while there is 'an angle' to this film, it makes little sense for any thinking individual to respect it's purported 'little guy makes good' myth.",2,4,7,5 June 2017
All the President's Men," Moderately dramatic results
","Hi everybody, in case you didn't know - this film is overrated.Scriptwriter William Goldman's name is so often bandied about or name-dropped as the par excellence of great screen writing, and this film is supposed to be an example of how creative and subversive the seventies were in film, euphemistically dubbed Hollywood's 'second golden era' by movie historians, but mostly because the eighties were so disposable and crass.Goldman's writing is definitely in shape, and he has a great ear for dialogue, but there's little in this film to really engage a viewer; there's two reasons the film isn't going to impress modern audiences, and I'll outline them here:Firstly, 80% of the film details failed and attempted interviews with faces or just telephone voices around Washington leading up to the Watergate scandal, and they are just what they are - conversations, anonymous office memorandums, conversations-whilst-driving, conversations-on-peoples-doorways, conversations-outside-government- buildings. Everyone of course either has fears for their identity, lies outright or is just too vague to attribute in a proper news vehicle, and basically the sheer repetitiveness of the scenes becomes stifling, rather than growing in dramatic tension in any meaningful way.The second reason this film doesn't hold up much today is because times have changed so radically. Discovering a politicians connections, work contacts, previous relationships, investments and properties can be done by anyone, whereas back then audiences were supposed to see the film as a struggle by Bob Woodward (AKA: The Little Guy) taking on Washington . . . and . . . winning!!!My last reservation about this film is that (to it's credit) it explores both the hypocrisy and abuses of power in so-called democratic societies, but at the same time rewards the viewer with inherently bogus ideals about the power of the individual. In the 2010's, after decades of deregulation and stage-managed electoral campaigns, all of which are hired or paid off by corporate elites, its completely obvious to any thinking person that the ideals of modern democracy are a sham, and that this film is about fairy-tale wish fulfillment, not the power of investigative journalism. To clarify, on any given policy debate issue, the actual power of the citizenry to effect the outcome process is zero, regardless of their strong support, indifference, or alarm. So, in effect, this film makes theater out of the idea of greater individual liberty when no such liberties make genuine effect for our common good.As a final note, this film never really shows any significant characters outside of the white male demographic anywhere at the Washington Post, let alone anywhere operating in Washington, with a few female office assistants aside. I would call it a well written film, with a few excellent scenes featuring an anonymous source (famously nicknamed Deep Throat) and basically a lack of narrative range and of course a predestined outcome. Some things age badly, and this film definitely has, I would recommend reading the screenplay alone if Watergate is a pet interest of yours, or the so-called 'political thriller' genre.",5,2,4,6 June 2016
