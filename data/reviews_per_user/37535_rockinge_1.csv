Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better Movie than the Critics will tell you
",Before I saw Star Wars the Phantom Menace I had heard some negative reviews about the movie.After seeing it however I really wonder what many of these people were thinking.While it wasn't as good of a movie as it was hyped up to be it was a lot of fun to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it.,9,0,0,21 May 1999
