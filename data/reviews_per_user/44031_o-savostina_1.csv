Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Go to Kazakhstan and know better than that...
","I just don't get it how questionable 'film-makers' pursue their objective to produce movies about Russia, Russian or any other people of the republics of the former USSR. I don't know whether to attach this Jew who tries to look Kazakh to an American opinion of the aforesaid people, but if that it really true then stop making fools of yourselves. This spoils your image immensely. Every time we see a so-called Russian 'from Siberia' holding a bottle of Vodka under his arm and wearing a cap with ear-flaps and swearing non-stop, we can't but start laughing hysterically. Featuring Kazakhstan and the Kazakhs in this way was not even funny or abusive. It was utterly, absolutely not having anything in common with reality. Go to Kazakhstan and you will be surprised not to say more. People there are very intelligent, educated and self-respecting and not at all poor by the way! They can laugh at different things, yet sh*t-related humor of the movie is not among them. I wonder if you doubt whether we have electricity or bathrooms or watch TV at all. Well, we do. And by the way unlike Americans we're interested in people outside our country and at least know how Indians look for example (has anybody believed that the Kazakhs look the way Borat does???). Many of us can name your states. What do you know about other countries?Seriously you need to do something with your education system. I just can't tell how I am scandalized by the people who think that any word of this movie is true. Just take a plane, book a 5* hotel in Alma-Ata or Astana and try to behave like Borat on the streets of these cities. And see how you will be treated (don't forget to tell that you've come from the US though).Wish you to grow up soon. P.S. Really do not have any intention to offend anybody in person. I know the moderators pf this forum will consider my comment containing a 'spiteful remark', but the whole movie is one spiteful remark towards the people of Kazakhstan, and I really hope that my words will be allowed to appear on the site.",1,8,16,10 December 2006
