Scarface," Brilliant Film, 9/10
","All of you people slating this to be a bad film on the message boards i do not think could be more wrong. This film is top notch and one of my favourites of all time.I have read the book and as always the film does not go into detail in certain areas and this is why it is a 9 out of 10. However, I do sympathise with directors and filmmakers and appreciate how difficult it is to pick the best most influential parts of a book. As it the film is well over 2 hours long so putting in many more scenes would make it to long in my opinion.Brian De Palma has produced some fantastic films and some strange ones to. Carrie (1976) contains one of the freakiest scenes i have ever seen in a film and of course The Untouchables (1987) is a classic gangster movie. I recently read that The Untouchables: Capone Rising is due to be released this year and is currently in pre-production. Due to show Capone moving to Chicago and as the title suggests his rise to the top.As for the film itself, it is in an excellent performance from all (especially Pacino) and even after watching it more than 5 times never fails to keep me gripped and entertained every time. I recommend this film to anyone who likes the gangster genre. It is full of killing, drinking, drug taking, drug buying and selling, money, nice cars, nice houses etc.Watch this film and enjoy it.
