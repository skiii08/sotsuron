The Sound of Music," This movie sucks
","There isn't anything to say about this drool to save it from the trash. I only hope that there is a version where the VonCraps freeze to death in an Alpine pass, OR even better yet Rolf shoots the pervert Capt. when he has the chance. I would have ! This movie is such dribble. NOW I have to write ten lines about it in order to submit my comment. Well here goes: I just get sick when Weasel screeches 'WEEEE' after the stupidest of songs, 'You are 16 ..' She reminds me of the GEICO pig, 'wee wee weeing' all the way home. Oh, need I mention the crappy dialog???The pidgin German? 'Fraulein' used extensively while the rest of the dialect is in English!! AND tell me what good Austrian would take 'Tea with Jam and Bread' over a literstein of fine lager and some WURST?? Do I have 10 lines yet? Yes,yes I do! Here's a few more. So what was the Capts. attraction to Maria?? Was it truly the pine cone up the rear that stole his heart? I would think that when you are engaged to a BARONESS with lots of money that some crummy, nun wanna-be would NOT be the woman of choice. BUT NO! VonKrap has his jib up for the novice and why?? Because she was probably a VIRGIN! Fresh Snow to muddy up. So he DUMPS his fianc√© and sets sail for the Lady of the Cloth. ALL THE WHILE living in denial that his crummy country has not been annexed by Germany's Third Reich. Hiding behind that, he shurks his duty as a Naval Capt. and scampers with his new found squeeze to Switz. Visit my new site named 'This movie sucks'. Sound of Music will have the premier position STARRING jULIE aNDREWS AND THE tONEDEFFS!!JKt",1,15,55,7 November 2010
