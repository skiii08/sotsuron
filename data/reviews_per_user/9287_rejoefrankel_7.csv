Raiders of the Lost Ark," Sublime, Exuberant, Old Fashioned Entertainment!
","RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK has been one of my personal favorites for as long as I can remember.  I have probably seen it over 100 times, and it never seems to get old.  This wonderfully comical, old fashioned adventure film is still (20 years later) one of the most exciting, adrenalizing, thrill rides ever crafted for the screen.  Easily watchable any time any day, I frequently return to it if I am in need of a surefire smile.  For some reason I have always found myself fonder of The Indiana Jones trilogy than I have Star Wars.  Both films feature eye popping stunts and special effects, entertaining sympathetic characters and old fashioned acts of courage.  But the Indy trilogy has always hit a nerve with me. Directed by the grand master entertainer Steven Spielberg, RAIDERS manages to take every man's most potent childhood fantasies and put them magically on the screen.  The opening with the giant boulder, the room full of snakes, the remarkable chase sequence on the truck.  If I had to make a list of films that most entertain me every time I see them, Raiders would be at the top.  Phenomenal filmmaking that introduced to the world the now legendary character of Indiana Jones.  Harrison Ford is the perfect everyman, and he leaves an indelible impression in the role.",10,0,1,6 March 2000
The Game," The Game definitely worth playing.
","A fascinating, original absolutely pitch perfect thriller that is mysterious, suspenseful and rich in character.  Michael Douglas stars as a successful business man celebrating his birthday.  As a gift for 'the man who has everything,' his brother (Sean Penn) gives him a ticket to a corporation called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS).  Reluctantly Douglas follows his curiousity to CRS and after filling out a lengthy questionaire, undergoing a rigurous medical examination and disclosing personal information about himself, he is told that his game will begin soon.  Almost immediately afterwards strange things start happening.  Things that seem so real that Douglas begins to question if people are actually trying to set him up, or if it is all just a game.  His life is threatened multiple times, he meets a beautiful, mysterious woman with whom he becomes involved and the plot takes a series of roller coaster dives until it reaches it's shocking conclusion.  Many people were unsatisfied with the ending of the film, possibly because there is no clear expectation generated by the midsection. But I feel that it is suitable and just.  The Game is a thriller that thrills, and it doesn't sell out for cheap violence, sex, or explosions (although it has a little of all these things).  It is a masterful film that demands multiple viewings, tautly directed and cleverly scripted.  One of the best thrillers of the 90's!",10,0,1,16 February 2000
Rocky," An inspirational character study that pulls no punches.
","Since its initial release ROCKY has been elevated to cinematic myth.  And four sequels later, it may be easy to forget ROCKY'S roots.  But this gentle tale of an Italian southpaw from the Philadelphia slums is worth returning to.  An old fashioned story about the potential for every underdog to achieve greatness.  Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay in only ten days, when he was little more than a bit performer in low budget films, and its success led him to become one of the most recognized movie stars in the world.  His quiet unassuming portrayal of the Italian Stallion, an innocent boxer who gets a shot at the heavyweight title of the world is always intensely moving.  A film that is both edgy and sensitive at the same time, ROCKY is every guy's STEEL MAGNOLIAS.  And for anyone who's had to fight for what they believe in, it is guaranteed to draw a tear.",10,0,0,13 March 2000
Kingpin," Pitifully unfunny gross-out film.
","Kingpin wants to be the film that people talk about and grimace with a smile.  It wants to be the ultimate in politically incorrect, tasteless, gross-out comedy, but it fails miserably.  There is virtually nothing in this film that warrants two hours of the discriminating viewer's time OR the usually gifted cast.  A waste of celluloid.  As forgettable as it is unfunny.",1,8,21,16 February 2000
Halloween," Ranks with Psycho, Silence of the Lambs and The Exorcist.
","The original slasher film by John Carpenter is also the best of the best. It initiated an entire genre of teen horror films, and psycho killer thrillers.  In its own way it is as effective as Hitchcock's Psycho.  First rate use of the subjective camera, and an emphasis on suspense rather than gore.  It still has the capacity to get under the skin, even if you keep telling yourself it's only a movie.",10,0,1,16 February 2000
Raging Bull," Quite possibly the best film of the 80's.
","Raging Bull is one of the most shattering dramatic films ever brought to the screen.  Shot in stark black and white, this is Scorsese's masterpiece.  A most unflattering biographical portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta, made that much more shocking knowing that he contributed to the making of the film himself.  Poetic, human, deeply penetrating; Robert DeNiro gives the performance of his career as the Italian from the Bronx with a ferocious temper inside and out of the ring.  There are certain transcendant moments in Raging Bull, where events onscreen overpowered me and ceased to be merely part of a movie.  Sad, unsettling scenes where it is almost embarassing to watch.  As if we as viewers are invading on something too intimate to be exploited.  Masterful filmmaking and a powerhouse script make this one of my TEN BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME.",10,2,2,6 March 2000
The Godfather," The greatest film ever made next to the sequel.
","Much of my male wisdom and philosophy on life is derived from THE GODFATHER. It is one of the most powerful, poetic, dramatic, stories in history, elevated from pulp to high art by a brilliant ensemble cast, mythical direction and a riveting script.  Brando is forever enshrined by his performance as Don Vito head of the powerful Corleone crime family.  Al Pacino stars in his breakthrough role as the Don's son Michael, who is ironically transplanted from war hero to mafia chief during a pivotal existential murder scene.  It is a comment on the fallibility of the American dream.  How every good boy has the capacity for bad.  Every character resonates with authenticity.   Every subplot relates back to the theme of redemption through dedication to family.  THE GODFATHER above all raises moral questions about how far one should go for their family.  It is a tribute to an age long before organized crime had been washed away by drugs and rock and roll.  When loyalty was ensured through family connections, and the power of the mafia was as strong as the national government.  A film that is truly epic in scope, and all encompassing in wisdom.  A masterpiece.",10,0,1,16 February 2000
