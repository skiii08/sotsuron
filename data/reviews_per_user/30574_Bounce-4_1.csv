Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was a great movie!
","I like star wars and none of my friends really do. But when i saw the movie i thought it was awesome. The sound effects were great,so were the graphics and special effects. I wasn't really into star wars until the movie, i just liked them now i can't wait until the next one comes out. I especially like JAR-JAR-BINKS. i think he is sooo adorable i love the way he talks but no one seems to agree with me. But actually Darth Maul had the best make-up i think they done a really great job on that.I really loved Queen Amidala's out-fits they were terrific!",Null,0,0,10 June 1999
