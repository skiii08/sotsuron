Men in Black 3," excellent time travel application
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. watched it because of will smith, but for a three-quel, i thought it took the space alien fighting MIB and created a new-ish story.I really liked Griff, his spacey personality really sold that 'all possible time lines' aspect of his character.As a person fascinated with time travel and inter-dimensionalism i really felt like they used space time accurately to tell the story.aside from bill and ted's, no other time travel movie has really nailed the dominant time line theory with any sort of consistency. If you haven't watched this movie, but really like time travel movies, i think you will enjoy it.",8,0,2,23 December 2012
The Maze Runner," this movie is awful
","1. Cliché dialog between characters, 'we have 3 rules here, don't hurt other people, contribute, and we don't go in the maze!' 'dont you get it, we are already dead!' 'We cant just leave him!' 'He not only saw the griever, he killed it.' 'This is your first new find in 3 years right?' 'I'm going back in' 'We found a way out' 'You led them to us.' 'Get....them.....out!'Under developed Characters-Thomas cried over his friend chunk, he knew him for 3 days.-Thomas and Teresa cant remember each other, but somehow had a kinship that surpassed even those loose relationships that Thomas had already made.-Minho, started off with the cool, special forces vibe. He was built up as the bravest of them all...then digressed into super infant status at the first test of courage.-Alby was the wise prudent one, but digressed into a fool by the halfway mark when he ran into the maze, breaking his own rules, but didn't have to because we find out later that the entirety of the maze had already been mapped.Conclusion-we have a video message from President Snow's (hunger games) wife, she says, 'I am sure by now you all must be very confused...angry, frightened. I can only assure you that everything that's happened to you...everything we've done to you...it was all done for a reason.'WHAT!?!?! i am sorry, but this is horrible!first 20 minutes, boring, next 40, C+ last 40-50 minutes, garbage.",3,27,51,28 September 2014
World War Z," To go or not to go...
","I am seeing that quite a few people have critiqued this movie in the negative, so i wanted to slow it down and ask some questions.Do you like zombie movies? Do you like action movies? Do you like movies that make you jump?Then go watch it. Its not a landmark movie, but its a good zombie movie.Does it drive you buggy when the story line is progressed only by the characters' own stupidity? Does it drive you nuts to see your main character achieve the impossible, time and time again despite having no super human abilities? Do you need your zombies to be super gory?then don't go to see this. I still thought it was a decent movie, despite its flaws",8,1,8,23 June 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," same story, better details
","IMO, i think the super A plus to this movie is the realistic application of physics. It shows a more limited spiderman. He must operate within parabolic physics and they tie that into the story.I thought this spiderman was a more fun, spunkier, angstier Peter Parker. He was definitely way more nerdy than Toby Mcguire.The addition of Gwen was great and I really look forward to seeing how this franchise manages upcoming installments under the new label.Dialogue was slightly lame, key point being, 'Gwen! Gwen! I understand! Your boyfriend is a man of many masks!' CHEESY!!!!My other knock was that it spent the entire time developing the angst of peter parker and didn't give enough development to Gwen, Aunt May, and Doc. Connor.I am a huge marvel guy, so i will continue to watch with a sense of forgiveness for the many flaws that Comic to Movie translations present.I am glad I waited for DVD because so few movies obtain that silver screen quality. If you liked this movie check out the other Marvel and DC titles. They are doing some decent work.",8,36,48,9 December 2012
Django Unchained," Tarintino fan-boys drive bad movies
","For nearly 90minutes this movie is an uneventful dry mundane story about some white guy who cares emphatically for colored folks because there are only 4 types of people in this whole film.The enlightened white man The liberated black man The debased white man The inexplicably incapable slave man....who yes, all happen to be black. by the way, where are the Asian slaves?Right up till the part where DiCaprio loses his shiz and starts a dialog on the medical reasons why black people make good slaves...this movie was dull. DULL DULL DULL.The final 45 minutes could have been made into a youtube mini-series, netted 1/1000 of cash flow but at least been loyal to story telling.So here is the first 90 minutes of the movie Lt. Aldo Raine, (now played by Christopher Waltz,) frees 'Steamin' Willie Beaman, (This time played by Jamie Fox,) takes away the shackles of a football and gives him a rifle.They go around killing white people, because we all know that from the beginning of time till Nelson Mandela was released only white people were wanted for crimes. ANNNNNNND, only enlightened white people could detect their deception. And wouldn't you know it, The enlightened white man again forces his concept of right and wrong on the liberated Black man...Played by Willie Beaman...played by Jamie Fox.They spend the better part of 2hours just killing white folk...that way the story of Brunhilde could be told....in a 2hour and 40 movie instead of another format that would net less money.Then they plot this elaborate scheme to rescue Willie Beaman's wife, Mia Wallace, played by Uma Thurman, played by Kerry Washington.This is accomplished by letting Egor, played by Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson, use his super spider sense and cat like intuition to detect the nefarious plot of buying a slave become known...then shoot DiCaprio in chest, sacrificing Lt. Aldo Raine, then after some fancy talking from Willie Beaman, you kill everyone, blow up the house and ride off into Super South, Super White, Super Racist Sunset...with your wife clapping you on like Mia Wallace after a line of coke.This movie was good, from about minute 130 till the end, the rest was a waste of time.I bought the movie and will be gifting it by throwing the dvd out my front door.",3,1,5,2 July 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," likable, predictable
","like a date all hopped up on schnapps, you know yer gonna get some, its just a matter of time.As entertainment, i like it. It was a fun, energetic movie that kept you wondering if the adventure was real.As a movie it lacked depth, believable characters, believable story, and under developed characters. you never felt like you were growing with Walt. In fact, I never felt like Walt grew as a character. He regressed back to his teenage self. And perhaps that is my disconnect.the one moment that you were hoping for, Walt telling off his boss, never really hit home as one might expect. Instead it was the exact thing his boss needed to hear.as a final moment of valor, it was WEAK! But the final shot, negative #25, very predictable, but satisfying. Now i would not have guess that picture, but its message, I was waiting for it from about the word silver bath.",6,0,1,8 February 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," the last 20 minutes (spoilers)
","So, the first 90 minutes were typical. I did continue to capture how angsty spidey seems in the comics. however...it was cliché after cliché...loosely connected plot point to loosely connected plot point.that is until the last 20 minutes or so.Harry shows up, figures out spidey is peter, steals Gwen away...peter catches up to save gwen, only he was (cliche) too late.The cry scene by spiderman at the loss of gwen was really good, seriously moving. The subsequent drama surrounding spiderman giving up because of his guilt, the world going to crap, his Aunt verbally chastizes him for letting his self go...he mustards up the courage to try, re-enter spiderman! Time and time again superhero movies are ruined by under appreciating the complexity of character.Dear marvel....aka Disney, you wanna re-stoke the fires of superhero worship...give villains their own 1 hour movies to become villains. Let us know why they are the way they are so that the fight between our hero and our villain becomes a physical exchange of philosophies. Then let the organic nature of life move superheroes and villains back and forth over the lines of what we view as good and just.",3,17,36,26 April 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," underwhelming
","So i think part of what makes a super hero movie great is the dichotomy between your hero(es) and your villain(s).I felt like the threat of an Ultron being virtually any and everywhere would create an inescapable feeling. Instead Ultron was more like Link from Zelda. Other than his infinite re-spawn capability this villain didn't scare me.Now Scarlet witch on the other hand singlehandedly kept the avengers at bay. Where is a bigger more exploitative use of her evil side...that may have made for a better bad guy than Ultron.To summarize, I never felt like our heroes were in mortal danger. The most difficult thing the Avengers had to face is evacuating civilians. Which for the record took about 25% of the movie.",4,7,16,1 May 2015
Elysium," Its a copycat
","Have you ever seen Johnny Mnemonic? *****Johnny Mnemonic Spoilers Ahead***** Other than Matt Damon's back story they are virtually the same movie.Healthcare is being denied to the masses. Our hero is brought in for one last job despite not having adequate supplies or resources. Both movies feature a storage device that resides in the brain. Both devices have the potential to kill you. Both heroes proceed despite the risk of death. Both movies have advanced bio-metrics to keep the baddies out. Both heroes seek help from a guy named Spider! Both heroes have the same character flaw of being selfish.The main difference, the acting in Elysium is better. But SOOOO not an original story. Neill Blomkamp should be ashamed for crediting himself as the writer.",5,0,2,16 August 2013
