Vertigo," A hard film to follow
","Vertigo is one of Hitchcock's film where you can't just wait to be scared. It's a film that needs great attention. Especially with Stewart's character. The plot, the characters, and the ending all have moments of doubt which makes you laugh for help. A tough movie to follow and understand, it only proves to film students around the world that Hitchcock was a genius for one simple reason.....he made the audience crazy.....and ask for more!",7,0,1,24 June 2001
Gremlins," A fun film
","Gremlins is one of the all time best fun family movies ever made. Without thinking, it must have been a fun film to make, let alone watch. The story line, characters, and even the setting are so enjoyable that a plot isn't even needed. Everything about the movie is already fun.",8,0,2,4 January 2002
Captain Phillips," Where is the NRA when you need them !
","Whether or not you want to attack this movie for not being a truthful depiction of what really occurred to the real Captain Philips, I can see this movie being a talking point for anyone who supports the NRA (National Rifle Association) Can't you see a Spokesperson from the NRA use this movie as an example why we need to have more handguns in the hands of 'good' people as oppose to 'bad' people. I do not in anyway want to support or defend the NRA on any matter, however, I can see the point of having firearms available on the boat to defend oneself against Pirates who want to kill you and take your boat. I am not an expert on the common practice and law in the world of Captain Philips, but it seemed if the crew was 'packing heat' that day, this movie would have been a 30 minute short instead of the epic that it was. I'm sure the millions of dollars spent on the rescue mission that took up half this movie would have been saved if someone had a sick shooter next to the first aid kit for Tom Hanks to use to defend his crew. Overall, Tom Hanks gives a good performance like he has in the last 20 years. The movie is an intellectual roller coaster on the high seas. The movie starts slow but finishes strong, and the movie leaves you thinking as well as somewhat entertained. Still, the idea of having the second amendment on the boat with you against Pirates makes you kind of angry that the second part of the movie was allowed to happen. I don't' think I am alone on this....thoughts?",5,0,0,27 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Proof that George Lucas is not GOD !
","Thank God for this movie. Before, George Lucas was named the God. Everything he touched or was apart of became gold. American Graffiti, Star Wars Trilogy, even Howard the Duck made money at the box office. Then, Episode I comes out and everybody hates it. Even your die hard sci fi nuts had to watch it three times to find out that the film didn't do anything for them. It's true, that anything compared to the original is hard to beat. In the end, Lucas made his millions off the movie. Then again, his strong fan base will never be the same. Lets pray to GOD...or George Lucas.....that Episode II will make up for Episode I",3,2,5,15 April 2001
Casablanca," Love it or Hate it
","You either love or hate this film. Most people love it. If you are a Bogart fan, this is one of his best. A classic film of its day, Casablanca is a love story to some but remains a classic to most. Like Citizen Kane, this film can be pulled apart to show how great the film really is. Still, others don't care for the film for its straight forward qualities that most films in its time has. If you can't relate nor understand the genre that Casablanca falls under, you can't enjoy this film. If you go for those 'romance movies' you'll enjoy this move more than you're suppose to. Enjoy!",8,0,0,15 April 2001
Lifeboat," Location!
","Just like in Rope, Hitchcock is successful in doing an entire movie in one location. At sea, Hitchcock sets the stage in a lifeboat. An interesting thriller, Hitchcock sets the story during World War 2 like many of his past films. Keep your eye open for Hitchcock's cameo on a newspaper advertisement.",7,5,7,24 June 2001
Unbreakable," A near miss of a hit
","After all, how can you top the Sixth Sense? I don't think you can? This was M. Night Shyamalan next film after his summer blockbuster that also starred Bruce Willis. An amazing story, with a wonderful and small cast of characters. Samuel L Jackson plays a unique villain that only Samuel L Jackson could play. Although the climax wasn't as shocking as Bruce Willis being a ghost in the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable stands in a class all its own. A wonderful look into the modern day 'Super Hero' and the world he has to and chooses to live in. A close runner up to the Sixth Sense, but just as good.",8,1,2,16 September 2002
Citizen Kane," A must film for any film maker
",There's something worth stealing from Citizen Kane if you're a film maker. What else can you say about this film except for it being the greatest gift one can give to the film industry. Having it have been a box office bomb when it opened in LA in the 1940's only adds to the films greatness. Citizen Kane was before its time and still remains today a movie marvel. There is not a single film school in the World that will not show this film at least twice to its students. A perfect film to watch and discuss for the entire class period. Citizen Kane has more examples of modern movie making than any other film made before or after.,10,10,14,15 April 2001
The Birth of a Nation," The first film that touched the world!
",Birth of a Nation is an example of how powerful cinema is. The message you can send to your viewers can start faiths. Film not only entertains but educates its audience. Birth of the Nation was the first big film to not only be a financial success but a success in using cinema as a vehicle to influence people. Your average common Joe all the way up to Woodrow Wilson saw this when it came out in 1915. The overall result was the Birth of Nation with the power of film.,7,3,7,11 September 2001
Amistad," History Alive
","Not as big as Titanic, but just as good, if not a better movie. Amistad could be considered a masterpiece among other Spielberg movies. For the hundreds of locals in Newport, Rhode Island who got to be extras during the courtroom scenes, this movie is shy of amazing. The Schindler's List for the African slave movement, Amistad is more than a movie. To many, it is a labor of love and a family history. It is a story of man in the story of humanity. Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey are perfect in their roles. Hopkins does an honor to John Quincy Adams with the perfection of his performance. He alone is worth watching the movie. Then again, the production value made this historical story real. The wardrobes, the set design and the characters brought history alive.",8,1,3,29 April 2005
The Girl Next Door," The Marketing of the Movie
","Having already complained how the Producers of the film have marketed The Girl Next Door...being a 'movie for a new generation,' I'd like to complain about their recent television advertisement. The movie is marketing 'real' teenagers being interviewed at the movies, that are calling their friends on their cell phones to let them know about the movie. This is amazing! I mean, the advertisement wouldn't lie to us and hire LA based actors to portray 'real' teenagers...would they? And wow! The television advertisements for the Passion of the Christ didn't have people calling their friends and family members. And that movie is the most talked about and successful film this decade. The Girl Next Door must be a better movie and something worth talking about......give me a break. The Studios who made The Girl Next Door produced a pop cultured piece of junk...marketing it that way and not the 'second coming.' Thank you",4,0,1,6 April 2004
The Girl Next Door," Pop Culture Junk
","This movie is a typical 'boy meets girl' story. Without getting into the whole 'porn' issue, the story is about a group of kids living their teenage lives in 'La La land' California. What I had trouble with is the way they marketed the movie being a movie 'for the next generation.' What? How does this stupid movie define a generation let alone be for a new generation? Since the film only showcases the high 1% of teenagers living in LA county, how can the rest off the 99% of the youth in America relate with this flick? It is unrealistic and crude to be anywhere close to being reality, let alone defining a generation. Besides that, The Girl Next Door is your typical story about 'the girl next door' that every guy wants. This storyline has been reproduced many times. This movie stands on its own by teasing its audience every ten seconds with sex, sex, and more sex. Far from an excellent movie. It will do huge in foreign countries since it depicts young American woman as easy going and very sexual.",4,0,1,5 April 2004
Billy Elliot," Filled with surprising moments
","Billy Elliot is about a boy who wants to dance. More than that, the movie is filled with surprising moments that take the movie enjoyable. Even if you are not a fan of dancing, the movie touches on human desire. A young man only knows he is happy when he dances. The ending is perfect, having everything come together. The movie touches on issues of sex, gender, class, and in the end, having our dreams come true when nothing else in the world makes sense.",7,1,1,8 February 2004
Batman Returns," The last great batman film
","Batman and Robin and Batman Forever are two great examples in the history of motion cinema that proves the theory that you don't need a worthy script to make a movie. Thank the Lord for special effects. Batman Returns not only has excellent performances from Danny DeVito and Michelle 'Pussy Cat' Pfeiffer, but remains loyal to the original film having Michael Keaton return as Batman. Also, Batman Returns is set in a realistic 'Fictional' city. The next two sequels to the Batman trilogy are set in fantasy lands right out of a 1970's comic book. Buildings that are 200 story long with giant Rome like statues that surround this crazy Gotham city. It goes to show you how special effects can carry a film. The true Batman trilogy ends with this film, the other two are just for show and marketing value. Take my word for it.",8,1,2,6 December 2001
The Great Dictator," One of the most successful political films of all time!
","Chaplin's funny, yet political film, in one of the most dangerous times in American to be both funny and political. The ending alone is more powerful than any image throughout the film. Chaplin makes clear to the audience that the common man's view is more innocent and poetic than any speech a dictator could make. While people want to remember Chaplin for such films like Gold Rush and Modern Times, the Great Dictator has to be is biggest and best films with a moral and decent message for its viewers.",9,1,3,17 October 2001
The Great Dictator," Film as a Vehicle
","Premiering in 1940, Chaplin was considered crazy. Years later, when World War 2 would effect every American life, the once crazy Chaplin was then considered a genius. Pay close attention to both the  Hitler and Mussolini characters in this film. Chaplin shows more patriotism in this film than any so called 'communist' could. It's amazing how reviews of films change with time. One of Chaplin's best political comedies.",9,0,2,27 June 2001
Alexander," Where's the story
","For starters, Oliver Stone is a great director whether or not he makes a good or bad movie. In my opinion, Alexander is not one of the top movies that he will be remembered for. Much like Any Given Sunday, Alexander is a big movie with a big cast and budget. While Any Given Sunday has a great story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, Alexander has a story without a story. The movie spent so much time worrying about telling the story of Alexander that they forgot to tell the story. I will admit, I had to walk out of the cinema after the first 2 hours of the movie. Finding out that there was another hour to go, I lost all hope. By the two hour mark, they were still trying to answer the WHY and the HOW in Alexander's life. Since the Passion of the Christ, I think Hollywood is without a reason why they can not produce a quality product on a historical event at a fraction of the cost. Alexander's budget was 3 times of the Passion, and an hour longer. The end result was a giant blockbuster for one, and a good attempt by another.",4,1,8,17 December 2004
Troy," Peter O'Toole gives his best performance in a long time
","Peter O'Toole may just be one of the reasons to go see Troy. Sure, its a big budget epic with special effects and fight scenes galore, but the acting by O'Toole wins the show. While half of the performances fall short of anything Hollywood like, O'Toole picks up the pieces and gives an amazing supporting role as King of Troy. The role of Paris and Helen both fall short with hardly any substance or character development. Paris gains no interests nor is he anywhere positive, Helen is nothing but 'skin.' No substance besides 3 seconds of nudity that make up her entire being. The movie may fall short with story, but like Homer's version, you have to like the genre to enjoy the movie. Troy will win some awards for its production and for Mr. O'Tooles terrific acting, otherwise, nothing else to see here except your garden variety epic with a giant budget",6,1,3,1 June 2004
Black Mass," Characters without Character
","Although I enjoy short movies, this 2 hour film needed to be 3 hours in order to work. Much of the movie is spent introducing characters who are quickly killed off or disappear before the audience gets to know them. The back story for movies such as The Departed helped the audience see the progression of the movie's characters to help them see the motivation of why and what the character is all about. We see the roles played by Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio well defined before we even see the opening credits. We see their past, where they came from, and home they were motivated to become the people they were. Black Mass fails at this miserably. We are introduced to many characters in such a short period of time. Each time, the audience easily looses track on who the main character is because we jump around to so many different people. For example, the movie starts with introducing Kevin Weeks. We start to take a journey with this character in the third person and then quickly leave this character completely to meet more characters. This is a story about James 'Whitey' Bulger. Then again, we spend more time with John Connolly only to loose any connection on what makes either one tick. The audience sees Whitey experience the death of many of his loved ones, but we do not see or hear of anything prior to the movie that would explain who and what he is and how he became that way. The same goes for Connolly's motivation. Just because he's from the neighborhood does not clearly define his motives, let alone his bond and loyalty to Whitey. The side story of the relationship with the Bulger Brothers fall short. The 800 lbs. elephant in the room is not really talked about as the two characters hardly share any screen time. Also, Black Mass does not have a single positive female character. Each is either limited in what they can bring to the story let alone a victim. Leave it to 4 male writers to fail at writing anything positive for a woman. Sadly, Black Mass is one of the best performances Johnny Depp has had in over ten years. The period piece of Boston / Miami in the 70's and 80's is great. The overall story of Black Mass is interesting, but falls short. The reason is simple. The main character is never defined. Although Whitey Bulger is the main star, we spend less than half the movie away from him as we are bored with side stories that are connected but have no connection with the audience. Black Mass could have been great, but did not have enough time.",6,3,4,3 October 2015
Lost in Translation," Lost & Found
","The first thing we see is a a side view / close up of Scarlett Johnansson's butt. Before we see the title of the movie, this image is showcased for all to see. Then, the title appears and we begin to go on a ride that we have never been on before. Whether this is your kind of ride, the journey is well worth it. Some kind of an art house film, Coppola escapes this dangerous idea by rapping the film up nicely enough to give her audience a treat. The ending finds its moral and makes everything worth wild. The only problem is Scarlett Johansson is not treated as the star of the film. All the critics rave that Bill Murray is great....which he is....but Johansson is just as good. Although Murray is funny as well as dramatic, Johansson deserves equal praise for her role.",7,0,2,18 March 2005
The Grapes of Wrath," Highway 66
","The Grapes of Wrath violates the majority ideology with the unhappy ending. The right of being a criminal. No hope in the American dream. No romantic interest. The crude look at law and businessmen. Poor working class, the struggle for a utopia. The anarchy of capitalism. Communism, union, moving out west, socialistic worlds are all discussed in the film. In the end, no one is to blame for the issues of authority, land, jobs, etc. In the end, the working class (under class) are seen as the people. We are the people! It is a proud ending but far from a Hollywood happy ending.",8,0,2,28 June 2001
The Godfather: Part II," A wonderful look at early Italian America
","The Godfather pt. 2 devotes a great deal of its story to the ways Michael (Al Pacino) and Vito (Bob De Niro) ran the family business. Jumping back and forth from the past to the present, Coppola captures early Italian America from the jammed city streets to the busy side walks of the Italian villages in Brooklyn. One of the greatest sequels of a film, the Godfather pt.2 is worthy to the original. Bob De Niro does more than an excellent job of portraying a young Marlon Brando in this film.",9,0,3,15 April 2001
Fargo," Raising Arizona 2
","The Coen Brothers do not write a movie based on a situation but on the setting and its cast of characters. Although we are not in Arizona anymore, the story shift to another world....far up north. We are still speaking English, but it is far from how they talk in the rest of the country. The characters create the situation and create the entertainment. When looking at a story and asking yourself, what comes first, the plot or the characters? When it comes to the Coen Brothers, the characters create their plot. Considered by many to be their best work, Fargo is unique and far beyond good. It is a movie made before its time for an audience who doesn't totally understand it. Yes, this is a drama / mystery, with moments of comedy and also a thriller / modern day horror movie with realistic monsters. With a French New Wave style, Fargo is perfection.",8,0,0,14 April 2005
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," A Vietnam Comedy?
","I have to be hard on this film because of th idea of it. Good Morning Vietnam could have been a great drama, instead it was a 'so so' comedy with a Robin Williams audience. Since about only 40% of this movie is fictional it is hard to give this movie any credit for being historically correct. Robin Williams is funny as always, still the movie plays both sides of the fence, most of the time, leaning on the anti-war side. Without Robin Williams, you have a story which is suppose to be a comedy about the Vietnam war. Hard to do, and without taste, if I may add. A nice movie, but far from anything timeless or terrific. Forest Whitaker continues to find work as he co-stars next to Williams. Always in deep though with a twitch to his giant neck, you can't really tell if Whitaker knows that he is being filmed...",5,1,9,27 April 2005
North by Northwest," Repeating Elements
","North by Northwest is full of repeating elements found in all Hitchcock films. In the 39 Steps, the hero jumps out of a window. So does Cary Grant. In half of Hitchcock's films, there's at least one scene on a train. Cary Grant has at least two in this film. In 39 Steps, the hero is drugged. So is Cary Grant in North by Northwest. And just like trains, the element of comedy is seen throughout the film. It makes you wonder if Hitchcock got lazy at the end of his career or if he just knew what sold an audience.",6,1,4,24 June 2001
Apocalypse Now," The Redux is an Education!
","The original cinema release of Apocalypse Now was close to perfection. One of the all time great war movies dealing with Vietnam. The Redux, is twice as good. Many of the 'lost' or 'removed' scenes are controversial. Other scenes are beautifully shot if not add to the original story that was Vietnam. Many of the removed scenes add to Brando and Sheen's character as more of their story is told to the audience. An interesting scene that last for 15 minutes and was taken out entirely was the dinner scene at the French quarters. Here, we see native French 'citizens' who refuse to leave Vietnam. Others in the group want to go and fear that much of the French influenced countries are being lost. Very political, the scene takes away from the overall violence that makes up Apocalypse Now. Still, the scene is great and adds to the story of why America was in the war to begin with. A great scene, and only one of the many reasons to check out the Redux version.",9,0,1,2 August 2004
Rocky IV," A 90 minute music video
","As an American of Italian decent who was 7 years old when this movie came out, I have to get down on my knees and praise that this was one of the greatest movies ever made! As a critic, I can list a number of complaints. Still, the production value and Sly's talents of acting, writing, and directing this movie, are excellent. Overall, this is a 90 minute music video with some great 80's songs and montage sequences. Dolph Lundgren would agree that this movie made him a star. Since Rocky IV, Dolph has gone on to star in a number of straight to video action films that nobody has seen.In the end, Rocky IV remains one of the very few entertaining propaganda films that Americans loved.",7,2,4,4 July 2004
Gone with the Wind," Scarlet's eyes
","Say what you will about Scarlet O'Hara, Gone With the Wind was a classic when it came out in 1939 and it will remain a classic for years to come. A movie marvel, Gone With the Wind was a triumph to be made. Not a single weak link in the film, Gone With the Wind is an example of what an American film should be. Unlike GIANT, Gone With the Wind does not represent the American Blockbuster. Instead, it represents everything good about film. The acting, direction, the production, the story, it all came into place with Gone With the Wind.",7,0,0,15 April 2001
Meet the Fockers," Hoffman at his best!
","In Ishtar, Hoffman was funny for about ten seconds. Here, Hoffman deserves an award for his comedic talent. He is not only the best thing about the movie, Hoffman gives one of his most interesting performances since the Graduate. Yes, this is not his 'Rain Man' award winning role, but it is close to one of his best. As soon as h is introduced, everything Hoffman does is funny. Everything that comes out of his mouth is either a punch line or something so odd that you have to laugh at it. Everything else in the movie blends, but without Hoffman the movie is less than Meet the Parents. Instead, this is a sequel worth watching. It pushes the envelop in what to say and see. More outrageous that the first, Meet the Fockers is a great comedy because it has no rules. It is a comedy that will make you laugh. Promise.",7,2,7,2 January 2005
Lawrence of Arabia," Beautiful Direction
","Overall, Laurence of Arabia is just that. A beautiful directed film. From its long shots of the deserts to the dramatic close ups of Peter O'Toole, the film is beauty. Winner of the Best Picture for its year, Laurence of Arabia is a winner of taste and enlightenment. All you have to do is shut up and gaze at its wonder of a film. The scenes speak for themselves. Why would you need dialogue.",7,0,2,15 April 2001
Velvet Goldmine," It's all about image
","An interesting look into the world of Glammer Rock, or so I guess it tried. A decent story about finding your true identity, Velvet Goldmine is all about image. The colors in this film are is slick and stylish as velvet. The acting is the same, with an outstanding, crazy like hell performance by Ewan McGregor. Sadly, the film may be black listed as being 'too gay' and for a 'gay' audience only. Fact is, Velvet Goldmine is a true 'art house' movie that draws the 'colorful' viewer.",7,1,2,29 November 2001
Hellboy," 99% special effect / 1% story
","Hellboy is a roller-coaster ride of special effects and catchy 'one-liners.' Without the computer / digital effects, Hellboy falls on its face more times than once. True, the actors held their own in a production made up of characters driven by themselves and not a story, Hellboy is an excellent example that the Hollywood studios have won the war against producing quality scripts into motion pictures. Hellboy is a good time if you want to see pretty colors and hear loud explosions. If you want a good story that will move you and make you think, pass on Hellboy and take in a good independent movie. Beside the fact, Selma Blair is terrific. Even though her character wasn't given enough time to progress, her beauty on the big screen captures her character.",Null,0,1,5 April 2004
School of Rock," Ben Stiller / Jack Black
","Welcome Mr.Black! Before, Jack Black was just an amazing actor who could play just about any wild or crazy role that was offered to him. Although his character in School of Rock is nutty, Blackn does a great job leading a cast and starring in a comedy. More than that, this is a family film. Many 'wild' actors can make a good living doing a small / supporting role, but to make that jump into family entertainment, very few can do. Joan Cusack gives another good performance even though Jack Black is in most of the movie. The kids in the film are the other highlight. When you get a group of kids on a movie, they can make or break the movie. Here, they are surprisingly great as they add and not take away to the story. A good family comedy!",6,1,2,18 March 2005
Ghostbusters," A Comedy Classic?
","Almost, the 1984 Blockbuster can now be considered a comedy classic. 20 years later, the move that was way before its time is still a delight for any audience. Many horror comedies fall short and can't find an audience. Ghost Busters is an original idea that wasn't too unique to make millions at the box office. Bill Murray adds to the genius of the movie as a modern day Charlie Chaplin with addition to slap stick and Flip Wilson humor. Aykroyd, Ramis, and Moranis complete the wild comedy that makes up Ghost Busters. While remaining to be somewhat serious, the film throws a series of jokes, gags and innocent humor that isn't found in many movies. Weaver had never been sexier whether she was fighting ghosts or aliens. A comedy that stands alone, Ghost Busters is great",8,2,3,22 July 2004
Slap Shot," The Ultimate Guy's Movie
","Slap Shot is not your typical Paul Newman movie. Although Newman's addition to the movie makes it somewhat serious, this is by far a different sports comedy in its own right. Listed as one of the top ten 'guy' movies on several if not most top ten lists, the rules are broken as a struggling hockey team fights on and off the ice in this crazy comedy. While the story has more to it than that, it is the characters of the movie that has made this somewhat of a cult classic. It's safe to say that every sports bar in American has a picture of the Hanson Brothers above or near the bar. For hockey fans, this is the best hockey movie ever made. For Newman fans, this is one of his more interesting, yet challenging films. While on the bus, off the rink and during the games, the audience relates to their struggle and the hilarious bond the team shares as brothers. Newman leads a cast of jokesters in this comedy 'classic' if not soon to be classic. Don't take this movie too serious, the point of the movie is to make you laugh.",8,0,3,28 March 2005
La Grande Illusion," A Masterpiece Story but not a Masterpiece Film.
","I have been told time and time again by several film historians, movie buffs and fans that La Grande Illusion is a masterpiece. I respectfully disagree. For 1937, it is a marvel or a story. The idea of its existence in 1937, when Nazi Germany was a reality and its its height of power and fear throughout Europe, a movie depicting a pacifist view on was and relationship to Germany showcases the power of cinema. Still, when including production value and overall story structure, it is difficult to defend Grand Illusion being a better produced movie than All Quiet on the Western Front. The movie does have several powerful moments that keeps its audience confirming its importance in cinema. The French book burning scenes, the comments on the Jewish character, the existence of a Black solider in prison, and the relationship between the German and French leaders, showing hope in the depths of war. At the same time, the movie's simple opening and quick and easy ending does not transition as well as other movies of its time. Unless it was the goal of Director Jean Renoir to have the story start and end without a beginning or an ending, the movie has its weaknesses. While some of the movie's editing is put into questioning, the movie's overall structure can be hailed good because of its story line and cast of characters. The movie gives us several scenes that keeps the audience appreciating what Grand Illusion is, A pacifist war film that is an excellent example of story over action. For a World War 1 drama, we are not witness to a single battle scene. A movie about War, there is no need to witness the battlefield. We partake in the war behind closed doors. More talk than action, Grand Illusion offers a different take on War and more importantly the relationship between the enemies of the so called War. Many will call the movie a masterpiece but I will continue to stand my ground. A marvel of a story for 1937, it's message is forever powerful and important. However, in comparison to other War time movies of its genre, I must respectful consider Grand Illusion a good movie, with great intentions. As an overall film, it falls short being a masterpiece.",7,1,3,25 November 2018
The Evil Dead," A Horrific Masterpiece
","Sam Raimi proved to the world that he could not only direct a movie but that he could create a product that was not only original but that could scare the hell out of you. Since the 1981 release, Bruce Campbell has found work on many film projects due to his break out performance in the Evil Dead. Raimi, has gone on to direct many films. Both have earned much of their career based on this little horror movie, that has been re-produced / recycled by thousands of 'wanna-be' film makers world wide. This is not your typical 'zombie' film, let alone your garden variety horror movie as well. The Evil Dead is one of those black comedies / horror movies that overwhelms the audience to either be scared out of their wits or won over by the movie's story and over the top characters. The Evil Dead is what most, if not all horror movies should be, very real and powerful.",7,56,89,13 January 2005
The Piano," One of very few films
","The Piano is a different film. Unlike many others. It's not a film that you just watch, you must listen. Listen to not only the words, but the music, the tone of the moods, and the movement from Holly Hunter's character. The entire film feels like it is taking place on stage. The setting is made for our enjoyment. Watch the setting closely as you watch the characters in the film adapt to the surroundings. You must watch very carefully, you may miss the message that the film is trying to make. Watch.......and Listen......closely.",6,3,8,6 December 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," Cult Classic
","This is a non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie. If you are a fan of Robert Rodriguez and / or Quentin Tarantino you will hands down love this movie. Whether you are a fan of the vampire genre or every horror movies, From Dusk til Dawn is a movie devoted to the traditional cult movie with its storyline and cast. The most interesting thing about the movie is its cast. You have many big name stars, but none of them are Hollywood esq. actors. Most if not all the actors were at one time in their lives, struggling actors. Many have done independent / low budget movies because they would never say 'no' to work. Harvey Keitel couldn't find work for years, George Clooney started out on the Facts of Life and Juliette Lewis keeps surprising us all with the kinds of movie roles shes chooses. Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin and Tom Savini add their talents to the movie as well. All three are best examples of actors who got to where they are with their own talent. Neither one had to sell out, use other people or have a cousin working in the industry for them to get an opportunity to be in movies. From Dusk til Dawn is a labor of love to the popular cult genre.",8,5,7,19 April 2005
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Love yourself
","Crazy, Cool, Colorful, and real. What an experience, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a movie worth talking about on the way to your car after seeing it on the big screen. From a non 'gay' point of view, the overall message to movie gives to the audience is: Love yourself. Short and sweet, that's what it's all about. It was also nice to see Rose O'Donnell do a cameo in the film. I'm sure it has made some people talk......if you know what I mean.",9,1,2,3 December 2001
Singin' in the Rain," A Hollywood Movie about the Hollywood Movie Musical
","Singin' in the Rain is one of few films that captured a giant audience of fans. It is a film, that when shown to a group of people passing by, will stop, take notice, and love. Whether color or creed, it is the perfect musical that speaks to everyone. The film that made Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds immortal, it is the film that defines Hollywood musicals.",9,1,3,9 September 2001
Once Upon a Time in America," A Beautiful, Expensive and Important Disappointment
","Once Upon a Time in America is the perfect example of a Hollywood film that you hate to love. An obedient film lover will make a list of many reasons why this movie is great. Why it should be on your list of movies to watch and why it should be considered an important work of cinema can be debated and defended time and time again. Still, many will agree that the movie falls short in many ways to be considered a classic. Fans and critics will both agree that Once Upon a Time in American will easily confuse its audience without hardly any trouble. A period piece that jumps around from decade to decade will alone make the time-line confusing to any audience. Throw in character motivation and you have a roller coaster of confusion and endless questioning. With a blockbuster cast of some of the most talented names in Hollywood, and a legendary film maker, it's hard to acknowledge that the end result would be anything less that great. With Once Upon a Time in America, it is just that. Many will support the imperfectness that the movie is by showcasing the several different edited versions and why the final version came to being. Then again, whether or not each version tells a different story, the overall structure of the story still remains. No matter if we have 3 hour or 6 hour version, we are still left with empty characters from the very beginning. With all its faults and mystery that both versions have, the plot, the theme and many of its characters have holes. The potential Once Upon a Time in America had with its reach as a cinematic triumph, falls short from anything spectacular. What could have been one of the best 'American' films, falls among the many mobster flicks which does not do this movie justice. Although the cons do outweigh the pros, the movie holds up with many moments of beauty.",6,2,8,16 December 2015
This Is Spinal Tap," The greatest Moc-umentary of all time
","Reiner took a chance with McKean and Guest to produce a 'movie' that had never been made before. The idea was not only different but took a lot of people to convince it could work. One by one, actors came out to support the film by doing cameos. Billy Crystal, Paul Schaffer, and several other SNL connected stars came out to add their own touch of genius to the project. In the end, you get proof that McKean and Guest are two of the most under appreciated actors / writers of the 80's and 90's. Their fresh brand of comedy has produced some of the most funniest moments in movies and television. This is Spinal Tap remains one of the most original and creative films ever produced in the comedy genre. 20 years later, the film has gained a giant following of devoted fans and comedy writers who have tried to steal from its uniqueness.",8,0,3,22 July 2004
There's Something About Mary," One of the Better Films shot in Rhode Island
","Rhode Island's favorite film makers, the Farrelly Brothers created one of the funniest films of the 1990's. There's Something About Mary was a story unlike many comedies. The film was a giant chance that ended up being a giant success. Since then, the Farrelly's have gone onto doing films the way they want with other not so popular films like Shallow Hal and Say It Ain't So. Still, the 1998 comedy blockbuster put Rhode Island on the map once again. Scenes shot on the East Side of Providence and downtown are still talked about today by the locals. Stories still float around about the antics Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon created on and off the set. More than 6 years have pasted and still the movie holds up on its own as one of the best comedies if not one of the best movies premiering in 1998.",7,0,1,19 July 2004
The Last Samurai," Dances with Samurai
","Even though this is a good movie, it is far from a great movie. An interesting look into another film where a man (from the West) falls into a world (the East) and evolves as the man he once was. A Man Called Horse, Tarzan (to a degree), Dances with Wolves, and now The Last Samurai holds these comparisons. Still, the movie stands on its own. With the relationship between Cruise and his female lead, the movie ends more powerful than other Hollywood endings where Tom Cruise would pick up his woman into his arms and carry her into the sunset. Here, we get the powerful close up of the two characters as we fade to black. Great action sequences and character development. The movie may fall short to some members in the audience. The reason? Not your typical action film and it is not your typical drama neither. Unique and worth a watch, the Last Samurai is one of Tom Crusies better movies in the past few years.",6,1,2,1 January 2004
Stalingrad," Not so Quiet on the Eastern Front
","For an American audience, this is an amazing movie to watch. Having no part in this story, this is a German / Russian look into World War 2. More than that, the movie is in a way, a sequel to All Quiet on the Western Front. Several scenes in Stalingrad are mimics of the original World War 1 masterpiece. The movie begins in paradise as the German soldiers prepare to leave for the battle front. From the start, we begin at the garden of Eden and end up traveling into the belly of the beast at eh gates of hell. The look into the Axis army as more than just foot soldiers for Hitler's pride is more than interesting. The audience gets to see a human side to the soldiers who were not just pawns in Hitler's idea. The ending alone shows a human side to every solider. Frozen in time for the audiences favor, the historical event is placed on stage for us to view. Much like reaching for the youth and innocence of a butterfly, the two soldiers holding onto one another as they take their final breath is equally as human and just. More than an anti-war movie, this is part of our history and is a story than needed to be told.",8,2,3,20 February 2005
Groundhog Day," Bill's Best
","Not counting Caddy shack, this is Bill Murray's best performance. While Christmas and Halloween have their annual holiday movies, who would have thought that Groundhog Day would have a movie of its own.A terrific (family) movie, Bill Murray stars as a sullen / sarcastic news reporter who is stuck living the same day over and over again....until he gets it right. This comedy stands alone as one of the funniest and most original movies of the 90's. Not many comedies can be funny and also end with a moral. Groundhog Day has both. Before the Farrelly Brothers or Wes Anderson found an audience, there was Groundhog Day. Pennsylvania never looked better or funnier.",8,102,169,6 December 2004
National Treasure," A Pretty Good PG movie for the whole family
","It's hard to make a PG rated movie that the entire family can enjoy. Harder than that, it's even worse for Disney to make a movie that can entertain children and keep their parents interested as well. National Treasure has just enough history and drama to keep the adults watching. Also, the movie has enough explosions, action sequences and thrills to keep any young adult and most children happy. Not your typical Nicholas Cage role, here we see Nicholas the serious and not the 'over the top' performance that we have seen him, like in Con-Air and the Rock. Cage's character is less defensive and more real. An overall good cast and story, the movie has held a large audience unlike most of the films that have gone to the box office in 2004.",7,4,6,2 December 2004
Rocky," Good Will Hunting of the 70's.
","Some called Rudy the Rocky of the 90's. The story of the under dog who strives to beat the odds. Like Rudy, Rocky was based on true events. For Stallone, it was his chance to be a superstar. It was not only his break through performance that made Stallone a star. Many forget that Rocky was his screenplay. Much like the 1,000 - 1 shot that was Good Will Hunting, Stallone was in the same situation as Mat Damon and Ben Affleck. Both films were true labors of love. Both believed in their stories. Each wanted to do more than just make a little movie and earn a pay check from it. Rocky has become more and more of a classic as time passes. It is a universal story with themes of true grit and passion. More than just movies, the message that films like Rudy, Rocky, and Good Will Hunting leave the audience is timeless. They not only score big at the box office, they hit close to home with a story that is pure and truthful. These movies capture the essence of the settings they take place in whether it be Boston, Philadelphia or Notre Dame. If done right, the overall theme of the common man making his mark and beating the odds is a genre that is dynamic and well encouraged.",10,0,0,19 September 2004
Rocky III," A great flick !
","Another film worthy of a Frank Stallone sound track, Rocky 3 has been one of the biggest box office turn outs in history. Not only did every Italian American run out to see this film when it was in the theaters but it made the song 'Eye of the Tiger' a national hit. Rocky 3 was also a debut film for MR. T. An excellent performance as one of the best villains in movie history. This one is not only written by Sly....it is also directed by him as well. Check it out.",8,40,54,1 April 2001
Mystic River," Sleepers recycled
","Mystic River is a good movie but far from an great movie. Sean Penn is amazing. It is Penn that makes the movie good. The story is dark like the characters. Having it portrayed in Boston makes the story real and even darker than it being in a fictional setting. Is this the best movie of the year....no. It is one of Clint Eastwood's better films and most dramatic. Compared to Unforgiven, it is much more dramatic and real. Still, Mystic River fails to hold its audience close to its end. Like Sleepers, the subject matter of the post lifestyle of the abused is present. I was hoping for more side stories, and I got it. But, like Sleepers, I wasn't taken over by the overall performances of the cast, besides Penn. If the Academy is smart, Sean Penn will walk away with his first Academy Award.....maybe.",7,0,1,1 February 2004
Psycho," Hitchcock's best film !
","It's sad but true, Hitchcock is known today by many for one movie and that movie is Psycho. With over 80 films to his list of films, only one stands out as his. Many people don't know this but Hitchcock's Psycho reflects a lot of his own life in 1960. His wife had recently had a stroke during  the production of Psycho. A lot of his fears of death and horror came out in the filming. Plus, for 1960 a black and white film was considered wrong? Why film in black and white when you can do it in color. Still, the Best Picture that year was THE APARTMENT and guess what that was filmed in?",8,1,2,24 June 2001
Rosemary's Baby," A horror film without any Hollywood horror!
","Rosemary's Baby is a classic because it goes against the classic horror genre. The start of the film, the story, the characters, the plot, and the ending are original. The ending alone grabs you because it is left so open to the audience to draw a conclusion. Even the climax is unpredictable because they never show what the baby looks like and it scares the crap out of you. Even the situation that Mia Farrow is in is horrific. No monsters or gore is needed with s story line like this one. This film is a must see for recent married couples.",8,0,0,4 October 2001
When Harry Met Sally...," Good Conversation
","It may be a sad fact that the majority of couples living in this country are not having open / good conversation with their spouse. It may be the opinion of this critic, but the world would be a better place if all couples had the same kind of conversation that Harry and Sally have. Considered a favorite by many, When Harry met Sally is the story about how Harry met Sally. Throughout the movie, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan do not hold back their true feelings and opinion. The end result is a happy and realistic ending. Much of the conversation between the two are not only entertaining but far fetch. Many people hold back their truth feelings let along the truth. Here, relationships take center stage as the audience watches what they wish they could and would like to say to their significant other.",7,3,4,21 April 2005
Steve Jobs," Steve Wozniak
","Hollywood has given us five major motion pictures about an asteroid that is going to hit the Earth. Much like that plot line, I strongly believe Earth has enough movies about the life and times of Steve Jobs. Whether he be a madman or a genius, the audience has enough stories on Steve Jobs in their library. Aaron Sorkin brings us another well written 'West Wing' quality script where people are walking and talking while taking and walking. Much like the movie depicts a sold out audience time and time again to applaud everything and anything that is and was Steve Jobs, movie's like this have a devoted fan base of fanatics that will wait in line for hours for an 'App' that they do not need. Steve Jobs is at times entertaining and informative while also being empty and pertinacious. Time and time again the audience is asking the question, Why? Even with a good back story of why Jobs left Apple and why Jobs was the way he was, the movie leaves us asking time and time again, Why Why Why? Why do we need another Steve Jobs movie? Why are we showcasing the life and the man: Steve Jobs? And why do we not give Steve Wozniak the credit that he deserves?",5,2,4,14 January 2016
All Quiet on the Western Front," The Best of The First World War
","There are so many versions of the original print, all are outstanding. This is the story of youth in war. The Platoon of the 1930's, this is far one of the earliest best films ever made. There are moments as touching and still as powerful now then they were back in the cinema 70 plus years ago. Paul, who is the hope of the audience portraying the innocent generation that was sold into war. This is not only the German view but the view of the soldier. No matter what side they are fighting for, this is truth of the battle. The scenes of the soldiers eating and drinking together are as strong as the battle scenes. The story of the passing of the boots and the questioning of why they are there, fighting in the first place are what makes this movie great. By the end, when Paul dies, the audience is shocked as there is no happy ending, no redemption for the character. Like the Deer Hunter, the ending keeps the audience guessing and thinking about the nature of war. Some versions have the movie ending with music, others have the film close in silence. The silence is more fitting as we see the young faces walking away from the audience after they look back. Before them stands hundreds of white crosses marking their grave sites along the quiet western front.",9,7,11,5 January 2005
Love Actually," One wedding and a funeral
","Love Actually, is actually, all of Hugh Grants's past films all rapped into one. You have moments of Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Fuenral, 9 Months, etc. all seens in Love Actually, Even some actors from Bridget Jones' Diary make an appearance in this movie. An amazing cast, Love Actually doesn't get the credit it deserves as being a big motion picture. The actors in the film alone make the movie good. A typical Romantic drama / comedy withe several stories in one, the movie jumps back and forth to one romantic / drama to another. Although it works to its advantage, it also works against it. Many in the audience wished there was more story to Liam's character as well as Hugh's. The story of a single Prime Minister alone makes for a good romantic comedy. Still, Hugh is a strong supporting actor instead of the main attraction.",5,0,1,17 December 2004
A Hard Day's Night," The Age of Innocence
","This is it. There has never been and never will be another band like the Beatles. The innocence of the generation is showcased in A Hard Day's Night. The perfect musical for any audience, the Beatles capture a time that can never be repeated. Like 4 childhood friends knowing that the Old can never get them down, they represented everything good and right of the world. They reflected the generation that wanted to be heard. Almost 40 years later, they are still as young as ever. Timeless, beautiful, true. A Hard Day's Night is perfection!",8,97,112,22 December 2003
Ray," Barefoot as a Child
","Although Ray is not a terrific movie, it has several powerful and touching moments that make it a good movie. There are scenes that catch your eye and make you look deep into the situation. As Ray's mother hugs him for the final time, you see Ray, without any shoes that he can call his own. Showing his roots, the scene scream a thousands words without having to say anything. An interesting cast, many faces are known actors, but not well known. Most films pride themselves with casting top actors. Here, Ray scores big by casting several good actors who aren't the top actors in Hollywood. Jamie Foxx, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, C.J. Sanders, Curtis Armstrong (Revenge of the Nerds) and Richard Schiff who is known for his role on The West Wing. He is very good in this small role, he looks so different without facial hair....and hair on the top of his head.",7,0,2,4 November 2004
Bring It On," Eye Candy.....nothing else
","Bring It On is just another example of the Studios failing to capture the youth of America. None of these characters exist in real life. Even for the pulp cultured, brain dead youth in the LA area, there are no realistic people in this film. Terrible dialogue with a terrible story, the only worth watching (sad to say ) scenes were the 'sexual' moments in the locker room and at the car wash. This movie didn't make it big at the cinemas because of its PG-13 rating. Right off the bat, only girl 10-14 were going to see this movie. If it was rated R, most teenaged boys and horny, single men in their early 30's would have turned out to the movies in hope to see some nudity. What else are cheerleader movies good for anyway. Face the facts, the only thing that saved this movie was the eye candy from the two female leads. Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushka. Still, the acting was very bland and un-motivated. Some of the worst acting I have ever scene, if it wasn't for the visual beauty throughout the film, I would have left during the first 10 minutes.",4,0,1,9 September 2001
The Terminal," Modern Times / City Lights
","This is one of those Spielberg films that are terrific but are not treated as so. Tom Hanks stars again in another Spielberg film. Once again Hanks gives an excellent performance. Pointing the finger at airlines, government, American is a post 991 world and humanity, The Terminal is too excellent to be treated as so. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci also give great performances. Tucci showcases a true evil that can be seen in today's society. Although he is not the 'bad' guy like most monsters in horror movies, Tucci is the force that keeps the hero from winning the day. Zeta-Jones does a great job reminding the audience that she is beautiful. Still, she adds to the story and helps bring out the best in Tom Hanks. It was interesting that in many ways, Tom Hanks plays Viktor like Charlie Chaplin. In many scenes, we see the Tramp in his walk. The people around him treat him as the wandering Tramp that by the end of the movie makes his mark on us all.",6,0,2,18 March 2005
Raging Bull," ZampanÃ² in modern day life
","Jake La Motta represented the ideal Beast Man of the 20th century. Raging Bull is his story. The story of a man who gains the world but loses his soul. Like (the great) Zampano in La Strada, Scorsese uses La Motta to show the similarity of two men. Raging Bull is in a way a love story between La Motta and the second wife he takes (Very similar to Zampano's purchasing of his second girl). In the end, La Motta loses his youth and his act and once again is left with memories after breaking down from the loss of his true love. Like the repeated song that La Motta says over and over and over again, Zampano has his trick of breaking the medal chain around his chest and having his long winded speech about it. Both stories are equal and amazing. It is America's La Strada!",8,1,1,8 August 2004
Blade Runner," Classic Science Fiction
","Harrison Ford, one of few humans in the film, learns human emotions from non-humans. A complex character, he plays the hero role but ends up not to be the hero. Sean Young is pure passion. Rutger Howard is nothing but forgiveness. An interesting fact: Ridley Scott did not want Rutger to be the 'Perfect' robot. Rutger being the poster child for the Nazi 'blue eye' 'blond hair' master race, it does seem hard to swallow Rutger being the perfect human robot. The entire film is right out of Metropolis. The futuristic buildings, the people, and the society are equal to Metropolis. The overall visual style to the film is its theme. It's a classic!",7,0,0,8 September 2001
Bruce Almighty," Buffalo Never Looked So Good
","I'm sorry, but only a few minutes, if that, was shot in Buffalo. If you couldn't tell by the clean streets and the obvious clock towers in Back to the Future on the Universal Studios lot, much of this film was shot outside of clean, quiet Buffalo. An overall good comedy for Jim Carey, it is funny for both a child and an adult audience. The only complaint I have about the film, other than it was not shot entirely in Buffalo, is that the studios marketed the film as a Jim Carey comedy. Even though it was the only smart choice to make, Jim Carey being a giant comedy star, the film is not your typical Jim Carey 'make them laugh' movie. Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman are terrific and make the film stands up on its alone without Jim Carey. Much like Liar Liar, audience members may have passed on this film thinking it was a typical Jim Carey film. In fact, Bruce Almighty is one of Jim Carey's better films with a good story and great cast of characters.",5,0,1,17 June 2004
Bull Durham," A Comedy with much more to offer
","It is nice to see a movie that attracts more than one kind of audience. This is a comedy, then again a love story. This can be placed in the baseball genre as well as a coming of age drama. Most movies claim to be one or the other and sometimes fail to be. Then again, when a good movie hits a homerun it can not only become a money maker and a box office smash, it can also become timeless. Before they became giants of Hollywood, Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins stars in this great movie as some of the most interesting, yet simple characters. Costner plays an aging baseball player who meets with rookie, soon to be great major league pitcher Tim Robbins. Out of the rafters comes Susan Surandon who, in her own may, is a Muse of the religion of baseball. Together, the three introduce three different worlds upon the audience. Each are believable characters even though they are in a way, fantasy like. A great story with a perfect ending, Bull Durham is one of those hard to find movies that is a crowd pleaser with just about every audience out there.",8,33,41,22 April 2005
Rear Window," Here's a good question
","Who is the hero in this film? Or Is the a hero in this film?Jimmy Stewart plays a helpless baby in this film. Stuck in a chair and unable to scream 'WATCH OUT' to Grace Kelly, Rear Window has no hero character. Well what about Grace Kelly? She's adventurous enough to go jumping into windows, maybe she's the hero? Maybe not. A hero saves the day which Grace Kelly does not. She is unsuccessful in this case. So is this a thriller without a hero.....you tell me.",9,2,3,24 June 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A nice little film
","What can you say about this giant money maker of a movie, it's a nice little film. Take away all the special effects and the powerful musical score and you got a universal story about good verse evil in a time universal to our own. Unlike most of the movies of 2003, this will stand the test of time and be watched by generations to come. It will last a thousand years for the simple reason of it being a simple, and somewhat, little film.",6,0,0,1 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The King of all Science Fiction
","George Lucas stole so much from everybody else to make this film, it is a shock that he gave Glen Larson a hard time with Battlestar Galactica. Star Wars is classic T.H. White when it comes to its story and cast of characters. The opening credits was taken from the movie the PLAINSMAN with Gary Cooper I believe. Luke returning home to find his uncle dead and house burned was taken right from THE SEARCHERS when John Wayne returns home to find his place burned to the ground. What else? Little things from Darth Vadar's helmet being the same of a Nazi's soldiers helmet to Obi Won being the perfect Merlin match. Still, don't get me wrong, this film is great. I just don't know why Lucas would get upset for the title Battlestar being named after the Death star ??? Go figure !",9,1,4,15 April 2001
Saboteur," Interesting Note
","Barry the hero travels East to save the day. In Shadow of a Doubt, the bad guy played by Joseph Cotton travels West for safety. Even though Barry's character lacks personality, he remains a solid figure in his role of fighting for liberty. The climax at the Statue of Liberty is amazing. Keep an open ear, there's no suspense music playing in the background. For Hitchcock, he didn't need music to set the tone. He was too good for that.",6,0,2,24 June 2001
Gangs of New York," All About America's Identity
","This is Martin Scorsese greatest work. Not since the Deer Hunter, has a film held as much visual power. An uncontrollable force of stunning imagery thrown at the audience. Even the ending credits of the film is filled with a punch, taken from a Cassavetes style of New York film making. Gangs of New York can be simplified as 'real' poetry. A story of identity with some much more. At times, the fantasy of this 'world' makes the audience forget that the setting is historic New York City. Similar to Taxi Driver, Gangs of New York hold common a simple truth, the search for identity. Irish, America, Native, White, Black, Free, Slave, Soldier, Poor, Rich, Political, Right & Wrong, Gangs of New York is a movie marvel that will stand the test of time for future generations to enjoy",8,0,0,31 December 2002
The Birds," Bryan Singer makes a good point
","Bryan Singer (director of X-MEN ) made a good point on The Birds. He mentions that at the end of the film, The Birds win! They are successful in taking over the world. While some feel its a wrong ending without finding out if its a happy ending or not for Tippy. Hitchcock does end it with a powerful end. The Birds win! They allow them to leave the house but not without showing that the humans fear the presents of the birds and that they stand as a force against them. Pure horror where you least expect it. Birds of a feather, they stick together.",6,1,2,24 June 2001
The Martian," MacGyver on Mars
","If you are not a fan of MacGyver, this two hour plus movie is going to feel like five hours. Other than some moments taken from Mission to Mars, Apollo 13 and Gravity, Matt Damon plays Robinson Crusoe on Mars. If you believe that millions of devoted fans of NASA would flood Time Square to find out if this movie will have a happy ending, then you can believe anything. If you love the science and math behind space exploration, the Martian is a marvel. If you like your space odyssey to have aliens, laser fights and chase scenes, this movie is not for you. Unlike Sam Rockwell's Moon, Matt Damon is not completely alone. Half the movie is Matt only while the other half is filled with a colorful cast that you often see in comedies. Overall, the movie helps you to smile from time to time but is far from a comedy...or a musical.",6,7,13,15 January 2016
The Godfather," The Godfather of Mobster flicks
","This is the one. There is no other. No other gangster film can come close to the power that is the Godfather. The original gangster films like Public Enemy and Little Caesar can't add up to the masterpiece of the Godfather. Equal to the movie Boogie Nights, the Godfather is about family! True, you got the mob relations like Boogie Nights deals with the Porn Industry, but it has nothing to do with it. The main issue of both films is family.The struggle of the family within the family. Watch and see how Michael runs the family different that how his father did. Watch the changing of the world as a new generation takes over. One of Coppola's best. It can never be bettered.",10,2,5,15 April 2001
