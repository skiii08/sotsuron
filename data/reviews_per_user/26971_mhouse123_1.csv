Marie Antoinette," a simple review
","I could take my time and say what everyone else has said but why bother? This movie has nothing redeeming to offer whatsoever. No story, bad acting, bad pacing, no ending, no information, nothing. I didn't pay to see it and I still feel cheated, like Sofia Coppola should pay me back using federal minimum wage standards to compensate me for my time. And I was actually curious about it and wanted to see it. If you don't really want to see it please don't wastes your time like i did. I don't need to discuss the VH1 rejects soundtrack that threw up all over this film enough has been said about that. My buddy Matt from Texas has a one size fits all review for movies like this, 'What a steaming pile of Pooh'.",1,0,2,20 March 2007
