Gremlins," Somewhat dark for the target audience, but still fun.
","The plot: Rand Peltzer, a traveling salesman, is searching for a Christmas gift for his son, Billy, and discovers a cute fuzzy creature named a Mogwai in an antique shop. He purchases it, but is told three rules by the grandson of the Chinese shop owner: Rule #1: Keep it(him) away from bright light, especially sunlight, which kills him.Rule #2: Don't get him wet...or he multiplies.Rule #3: Don't ever feed him after midnight.Unfortunately, he does get wet, his copies turn out to be less than well-behaved(particularly one with a stripe), and they trick Billy into feeding them(except for Gizmo, the original)... which results in hundreds of scaly, ugly reptilian monsters dubbed Gremlins who destroy the town he lives in, along with a few residents.If Joe Dante meant it to be aimed at kids, it wasn't the best idea, but for everyone else, it's a fast-paced, nifty little ride(if you miss the theater sequence, you've missed the best scene), which managed to become a big hit. I enjoyed it for the most part.4 out of 5.Rated PG for comic violence and gore.",Null,0,1,29 August 2004
Jaws," Great White in great film
","(SPOILERS!)The plot: Girl goes swimming at night, gets killed by shark, the police chief Brody decides that the beaches need to be closed, but the greedy mayor leaves them open for the Fourth of July weekend. Eventually another person(a boy on a raft) bites the dust in a violent death that leads to a reward for $3,000. Then a shark expert(named Hooper) flies in to investigate, and the local eccentric sea captain Quint joins with marine biologist and police chief to go out and kill the big old fish after a few more deaths.Needless to say, there's a few screw-ups, including: The severe underestimation of the killer's strength by Quint. A poison dart that misses its mark. Quint's death... which leads to an awesome finale, in which Brody blows the shark's head up with an oxygen tank. 'Smile, you son of a-' Then the happy ending in which Brody and Hooper swim back to shore. THE END. But wait! Three sequels!If you get past the obviously fake shark, and focus on the good(which there's lots of), you have a five-star film, which is one of my personal, all-time favorites.Five out of five.",Null,1,3,29 August 2004
