Mission: Impossible III," Best of the 3
","I loved this movie. I think a lot of it has to do with J.J. Abrams as director. It definitely had an Alias feel to it. Even some of the characters reminded me of Alias characters. It was packed with action from beginning to end and Tom Cruise was great. I have had a crush on Tom since Risky Business although I had been rethinking that crush over the past year (you all know what I mean, lol). I was skeptical going to see the movie, but wow.....it was great. Tom is a great action hero and has not lost any of that magic. Phillip Seymore Hoffman was great as well. I would recommend this film to anyone. And, I hope they make a MI 4 very soon!!!!",8,2,4,11 May 2006
