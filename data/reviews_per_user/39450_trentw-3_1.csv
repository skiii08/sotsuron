Lucky Number Slevin," Really sweet movie
","I came into watching this movie and my only knowledge was that Bruce Willis was in it. Let me tell you, Bruce Willis is not the only person that brings a stellar performance. Josh hartnett was amazing as this character and you get a couple of good laughs out of him too. I love movies that leave you confused through out the whole thing and then all of a sudden everything is clear to you. If you like those movies then you better go and get this one right now cause you will surely enjoy it. This, in my mind, is definitely in the top ten movies of 2006 because honestly this fits my personality perfect. Not in the fact that I'm a wonderful assassin but in the fact that i love good action and good laughs and good endings and this has it all.",9,0,1,29 November 2006
