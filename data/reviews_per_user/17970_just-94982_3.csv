","Mike Lowrey (Bad Boys (1995) last scene after car chase 1:50:35):'Now, THAT'S how you're supposed to fiiiilm.From now OON, THAT's how you film slasher movies!'
That's it.That's a minimum standard on how you shoot 'go chase them conniving thirty years old highschool kids'This flick lacks naturalism/realism, but everything else on top
That era of movies circles back when 'soon' realism will be abundant -next era, after 10-15 years, will be again monster chasing dudes, because...You know...We've done with human chaser - it seems too week & we all tough internet warriors who can CLEARLY defeat human chaser - give us impossible task...Aaaand..It will all go dumb again",7,0,1,18 July 2019
