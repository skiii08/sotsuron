The Rock," an all time great
","i was pleased to see that the rock doesn't depend TOO much on guns,missiles and brawlin. ed harris does well as a marine who has tired of the government draggin its feet on giving restitution to the soldiers he has lost during his tours of duty. his only option he sees is to hold san francisco ransom with nervegas missiles or pay several million toward his cause. cage is also well suited as a lab rat recruited by the feds to help bring down ed harris and his hired mercs.sean connery like ed harris also has a dinosaur sized bone to pick with the feds from being jailed for 30 years without a trial for having evidence the g'ment wants hidden.last but not least,lovely vanessa marcil is cages soon to be wife who has just told him of their expected child.although her part in the film is not very large,it only makes you wanna jump through the screen and do the 'grab you cha cha cha' with her when she does appear. only one person seems to have not enjoyed this film that i saw.perhaps he too has been screwed by the government had has yet to hold a city ransom and meet his demands.oh well.",10,1,1,14 February 1999
The Mask," a future classic
","the way the producers laid out the movie version of the mask,will definitely make it one of the films people will buy/rent for quite some time.jim carrey basically plays himself to a degree:spontaneous,wacky and a pure clown of a comedian.cameron diaz shines bright in her first major role of her budding movie career.max the dog(milo) should also see plenty of work after his faithful and fearless performance.the soundtrack also deserves praise when most are a big letdown,not this time folks.",Null,1,1,13 January 1999
Spice World," campy
","Spice World reminds me of those fab four movies of the 60s. Those movies were primairly made for their fans. The same can be said for Spice World: a Hard Day's Night 1997, but with 5 lovelies instead of 4 mop toped guys. If you try to take this movie too seriously then you will miss the point: it's not supposed to be that way folks. Enjoy this film for what it brings to Spice lovers around the globe, silly fun and nothing more.",7,1,2,17 March 1999
The Mummy," Smashing!
","Ok all you wannabe film critics,this movie was made to be a fun film,not one that is supposed to be in the running for a slew of academy awards so lighten up please.The Mummy also is not ripping of Indiana Jones films either.What it IS,is a new twist on an old tale made popular way back in the 1930s by Universal Studios.Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weize are the hero and heroine of the picture and they do their characters justice throughout the entire film.The Mummy named Ihmotep has been given more power and mystique courtesy of Lucasfilms Industrial Light and Magic with highly enjoyable results.So folks,keep in mind that Indiana Jones or the original mummy films should not be used to judge this film by.For if you do so,be prepared for a let down.However,if you see this film without such pre-determinations,you should be able to enjoy this much needed hit from the studio that gave movie monsters their first shining moments six decades ago.",Null,0,0,12 May 1999
