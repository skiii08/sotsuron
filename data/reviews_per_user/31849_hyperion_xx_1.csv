Skyfall," The last Proof
","I watch movies since 37 years now from all over the world!Skyfall for me is the last proof, the England is becoming the new star in movie-making. They will soon replace Hollywood as worlds number one! And Skyfall is only the peak of all!They have:Skyfall Sherlock (the series, and not the odd Hollywood-Movies) Downton Abbey Luther Doctor Who Spooks ...What does this movies and series have in common, which doesn't exist in US-Productions?They have REAL Emotions in it. They have the exact amount of emotions that is needed! They have deep! They have style! They have Character!You wouldn't expect that from the stiff British people, but they have it!The same thing is Skyfall! Everything a Hollywood Blockbuster like Mission Impossible (I like this series too!!!), Bourne, Transformer ... doesn't have, Skyfall has it! There are not much us-productions, which have the same good ingredients. (Die Hard had it - Emotions, or Backdraft - but how old are these movies?)Hollywood should soon take an example from the British Film-Industry, or they will loose ground! They should not make the same stuff over and over!I do not hate Hollywood! I'm grown up with their movies, but it is time, to change something!GO AND SEE SKYFALL for an example!!!!!",10,3,20,4 November 2012
