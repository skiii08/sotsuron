Blade Runner 2049," Disappoining And Inconclusive
","I wanted to like it and I thought I would like it and there were moments watching that I thought I did like it, but walking out of the cinema and putting it in perspective and comparing to the prequel this was a below average film.The movements are slow, several characters existence and vocation make no sense (chief of police leaving evidence unguarded, chief of police visiting a contractor at home for 5 minutes, killing/detaining a man who has been peaceful and productive for 20 years as a matter of policy, a planet that is post apocalyptic but has the best amenities and beautiful women...).I did enjoy the provocative girlfriend and the call girl who were fantastic and hawt, I loved the dog and its reactions and then wondered what this film is about. If it is about holographic sexiness then I am there, but I assume the film was not trying to tell us the future if fun and bright!",4,4,8,17 November 2017
Your Name.," A Good Anime That Is About To Be Ruined
","A good anime that has a message, interesting characters, authenticity despite retelling a niche sub-genre story. The work that has gone into and the originality are appreciated. What was less impressive was the stoic reactions and matter-of-fact behaviours. With that said this is quite an accomplishment and I know that with the announced Hollywood remake we the fans need to boycott the coming movie. Hollywood has to learn that their predatory attack on anything popular for their infamous remake series will not be tolerated. Look how they mocked Ghost In The Shell (rolling my eyes as I write).",8,312,351,17 November 2017
