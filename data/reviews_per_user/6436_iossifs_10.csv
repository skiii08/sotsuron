The Blair Witch Project," Leave us alone!!!!!!!!
","Why should we be forced to watch a 'thriller' of a very low budget and knowing it's all made up?!!!?? Scary? Absolutely NOT!!! Well, good old days of REAL thrillers are gone...period.Thanx for listening",1,1,4,12 December 1999
Requiem for a Dream," guidance required
","don't see this film alone. aronofsky created another masterpiece to follow the magnificent pi, characters, direction, art direction, an anthology scene every second of the movie. it will make you feel so bad admitting that this is one of the best films you have seen lately. please do not see it alone...",10,0,0,29 July 2001
Gravity," An audiovisual marvel on a cliché pile
","OK. That is an anthropological behaviorism thesis; all American critics have been thrilled with the movie while Europe and other parts of the globe not so much. The exceptional ambiance of the film is constantly fighting against bad dialogue, sultry family dramas, nationalism and the heroic choir soundtrack. It really is interesting to realize that the only poor reviews talk about 'unrealistic scenario' science and physics wise, while no one mentions the obvious pseudo-heroic cocktail of epanaleptic, superfluous, easy Hollywood blockbuster doses. Watch it in 3D though as it is meant to be watched, a delight for your senses, but please don give me crap about any depth whatsoever. Yes, James Cameron loved it. I also love his films, it's true entertainment (not at all pretentious as in the case of Gravity) and I do not seek any deeper meanings. Mr Cuarón here, would have loved to take his movie a bit further, but some things are just not allowed in Hollywood.",7,0,1,20 November 2013
Se7en," Cult Paranoia
",The dark and permanently rainy sky of a big city with no identity is watching two policemen throughout a nightmare journey until Seven. The seven deadly sins (and murders) are converted in the hands of a serial killer into a motive for the  purifying of the modern world. Fincher's camera follows the steps towards salvation while creating a mental jigsaw which balances with expert manipulation between paranoia and realism. A total cult - the most classic (along with The Silence of the Lambs) thriller of the 90s.,9,0,0,26 November 1999
Oldboy," unable
","I believe I am unable to criticize this film. This is the future of film making and I am thankful that I was there when this new era of directing has begun. Definitely the best film of the decade and in the top ten films of all time. Some review committed the crime to compare Kill Bill with Oldboy... Please do not do this mistake yourself, Tarrantino is fun to watch, but this is the kind of film that you can watch it again and again and always discover how deep it goes . If someone does not like this film , I am sorry to inform you that you have absolutely NO idea about what is called 7th Art. This film is justifying (among other masterpieces) the existence of celluloid.",10,16,93,5 July 2005
District 9," Support Non-Human Rights
","This actually is the sci-fi treat for this decade to close in a heroic way. Neill Blomkamp has given us a masterpiece, and after all this hype before the opening of this film, who could thought it would meet such high standards. The 'actors' have given their best shot. The CGI team produced results never-before-seen. Sound editing and cinematography were top notch. Soundtrack, photography etc. all excellent. The plot was a perfect blend of drama, comedy, social messages, agony and plenty of really good action. The director after his previous exceptional work made an instant classic/cult film to be talked about for years to come. Kudos to Peter Jackson for trusting him! This is a film you will enjoy if you like good cinema but not if you are expecting G.I. Joe and the rise of the cobra or Terminator Salvation. People are talking about holes in the plot and shaky cameras, about clichés and predictable scenario, about copycats and absurdity... Trust me, if you enjoy good cinema , you will enjoy District 9. Watched it twice and it only got better.",9,0,6,17 October 2009
Mulholland Drive," Enough with that!
","Well, ok , Lynch has shown us something different and exciting with his previous films ; enigmatic filming with Lost Highway beyond standard levels, but enough is enough. I deny to accept that Mulholland Dr is a good film : a director repeating himself, poor acting, a very tired Angelo Badalamenti, and  I think that even if I was a lesbian i would still have the same opinion...no thanks.",6,0,1,23 January 2002
A Clockwork Orange," need a summary? my comments are almost a line......
","It's almost virtual reality! I mean, when the emotions caused by a movie are that strong then I'm positive the film is more than just 'perfect'. Don't like to say more; if you've not seen it yet, it's your fault!!! CONGRATULATIONS once again Mr Kubrick.",10,0,0,16 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," CLASSIC!
","I can still remember not being able to close my mouth after watching Star Wars for the first time...Innovative Lucas and his team reinvented science fiction on silver screen making Star Wars one of the films that will always have an exceptional place on our movie collection. Lucas prove that a good Hollywood classic does not need ultra special fx and astronomical expenses nor the most famous actors and actresses to write history...An excellent plot, powerful music, immaculate characters and a little help from The Force...One question George; why did you have to add these 'remastered' scenes? They look so alien...",10,0,0,20 July 1999
V for Vendetta," Hollywood?
","being a fan of the matrix and but at the same time disappointed by the matrix reloaded and not to mention the matrix revolutions , 'the brothers'' new project was anticipated yet with doubt... this film though caught me out of the blue ; i was not expecting such a story to come out from a Hollywood studio ( i do not know if it would have seen the light of day if it was set in new york instead of London though...)! i am not quite sure if everyone can really understand all the messages that are sent from the film. this movie is controversial, revolutionary, politically incorrect by all means possible, annoying to a large majority of people, many stomachs will feel turning around.... a salute to the writers and director and i really do not know how would i feel if a was a British man and i was coming out of the theater after watching this film. a must see by all who have felt the revolution in them even a little tiny small bit...",8,0,2,2 April 2006
