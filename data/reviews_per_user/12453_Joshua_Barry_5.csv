The Avengers," A Perfectly Crafted Super Hero Movie
","So they all come together to fight a battle they cannot fight on their own. They don't exactly get along or have much appreciation for each other to begin with, but this is what makes this film work. This has been a long time lead up, starting back in 2008 with Iron Man and then ever so slightly linking each of these individual films together. It has been a hugely lucrative series for Marvel, sometimes good and other times not so good, it has all been leading to this point.For me, the picks out of these previous films are Iron Man and Thor, with The Hulk behind that and then right at the bottom, Captain America. Iron Man was fantastically fun with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr.), the larger than life character who has it all. He is smart, witty, funny and extremely like able and loves what most boys do, his toys. With a great visionary director in Jon Favreau at the helm both the Iron Man films were extremely enjoyable. Thor, had a great cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddleston. Kenneth Branagh really captured the fun and excitement of the story. The second attempt at The Hulk was quite good, but Norton, as much as I love him was not quite the right choice. The CGI Hulk was never really there yet and always felt very animated and never part of the furniture. Captain American, as a movie didn't work for me. There was not enough about him to keep me interested, not enough fun had. I love Chris Evans and thought he was the right choice, but with a fairly dull script and a much too serious approach, I was quite bored by the end.Now the question was always going to be, can they work as a group? With the much needed change of Bruce Bana to Mark Rufallo, and a few additional characters thrown in, the answer is a gigantic yes! Joss Wheddon does an amazing job of keeping a huge number of characters in tune. It is always the toughest element in story telling and here it really had a huge potential of being jumbled and disjointed. It is none of the above and on the contrary it is, in its entirety, exceptionally well balanced. The banter between the characters is priceless and gives the film a consistent flow and usually arises in what would normally be fairly dull background scenes. Everyone is extremely good, but the newcomer Mark Rufallo shines as Bruce Bana and 'the other guy'. The special effects for The Hulk are incredible and they have finally got him pretty much perfectly moulded into his surroundings. With the CGI sorted and the right actor behind the green monster, he seriously works and almost steels the show. Not quite, but he certainly steels any scenes he is in. Downey Jnr. as Stark is his usual witty, charming self and sets the banter off with great timing and finesse. Newcomers to the series in Black Widow played by the luscious Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye played by the always solid Jeremy Renner are both commendable additions and both fit in marvelously. Tom Hiddleston as Loku, the villain of this story, plays his part impeccably well and deserves much praise and respect for this outing.The special effects are superb and the fight scenes are tremendous. Joss Whedon has definitely shown he is an avid comic book fan himself. He shows that he is not afraid to have fun with his material, and this really is the whole point. Where Chistopher Nolan has brilliantly turned Batman into a dark knight, Whedon constantly lightens the mood, which really is the only way this type of ensemble film could work. There is never a dull moment as the pace of the film is constant and this makes for a hugely entertaining film in ever way. This really is a perfectly made comic book adaptation.Smart, witty, funny, and hugely entertaining! This action packed joyride is brimming with different personalities, huge egos and awesome super powers. They work together perfectly in this marvel from Marvel! Go Joss!! filmnotion.com",10,17,33,26 April 2012
Ted," Ted is one hilarious movie.
","So It's school holidays and I decide to go and see a preview screening of Ted at 7pm. The cinema is full and I am entirely surrounded by teenagers, sucking furiously on their frozen cokes and jittering around in their seats as if they were under the influence of some extremely high uppers. The movie begins, yet the kids don't settle down at all. Now normally this would completely annoy the hell out of me, and to some extent it did (hence me still thinking about it now), but it didn't take anything away from this farcical comedy written and directed by the very talented Seth MacFarlane. Ted, voiced by MacFarlane, is absurdly hilarious, with his crazy antics, insane innuendos and the occasional racial slur, it is hard not to laugh out loud. This is all created by the wonderful sound of Seth's voice. I really don't think it would have worked half as well if they have of got someone else. The rest of the cast bounce off him wonderfully. Mark Wahlberg as Ted's best friend for life, fits the bill perfectly and Mila Kunis is great as the girlfriend. For me though, Giovanni Ribisi, when he arrives on screen, plays creepy, camp and evil all too well. He is a joy to watch. (maybe joy is the wrong word here).This is an intelligent and very cleverly thought out comedy. Don't get me wrong, I know the image of a little teddy using the F word and smoking dope continuously, is going to be funny no matter what, yet doesn't sound like it would have to be too clever. The script is 10 out of 10 and this coupled with the perfect pace of the film means never a dull moment. My problem with most comedies is they can't keep the laughs going for the full running time. Here the jokes are very witty, insightful and out of the ordinary and stays that way for the full 106 minutes. The fact that this movie is about a teddy bear whom magically comes to life and then seamlessly blends into day to day life, for me, has failure written all over it. Yet, MacFarlane creates a world where all this doesn't matter and the viewer takes the magic for granted and goes along for the ride. And the ride is most certainly worth the trip.And lets not forget the animation. Ted never looks out of place. The special effects are seamless, even in high action fight scenes, they don't miss a beat.Ted is one hilarious movie. This, for me, is right up there with the best comedies of the past few years. Crude, intelligent and totally entertaining. http://www.filmnotion.com/ted-movie-review/",8,20,39,8 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Lazy, clunky, hectic
","It was never going to be easy to finish off such a beloved franchise, and we only have to look at the final season of GOT to know that. In a similar turn of events, The Rise of Skywalker is ultimately let down by trying to cram too much content into the story. J.J. Abrams quickly jumps from idea to idea without giving enough time to reflect or be able to emotionally attach yourself to what's going on.
.
I'm no diehard Star Wars fan. I have always enjoyed the films, but they aren't religion. So this is where my point of view comes from. I really liked The Force Awakens (8/10) and LOVED Rogue One (9/10). The Last Jedi wasn't bad, but left me slightly underwhelmed (7/10). The Rise of Skywalker is the worst of the new films. The runtime of 2hrs 21 is no longer than the last two, but it feels it. It really feels long, and I put this down to hectic and clunky story telling.
.
In terms of performances, Daisy Ridley gives her best to date and Adam Driver is great! There's also some great action pieces, and a wonderful array of weird and interesting creatures to be seen, which you would expect.
.
I think the biggest thing to take away is there is nothing new here. It feels like the same story. It didn't have any wow moments. It really does feel like a Disney film. One that takes no risks, and tries to play to the crowd. The fan fare is so in your face, that it almost feels insulting. It just feels the same as Disney has been doing all year. Rehashing old favourites because they know people will pay to see them, good or bad. Unfortunately, in terms of quality this year, Disney seems to be having the Netflix effect. Quantity over quality.",5,7,21,19 December 2019
A Quiet Place," Awesome character driven thriller!!
","Kransinksi jumps behind the camera again, with a very different feature to his previous film. I really liked 2016's The Hollars. It was a nice little indie drama that was full of great performances.A Quiet Place is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where a family now lives in silence due to killer monsters stalking their prey by sound.An awesome character driven thriller that is equal parts tense and emotional. It's an original idea for a horror film that works due to its direction and performances. The best thing for me was how quiet the film is. You don't want to breath too loudly while you're sat on the edge of your seat. At 90 minutes it's short and oh so sweet.

1917," {SPOILER & PLOT FREE}
","1917 is Sam Mendes second foray into the war genre. Ah yes, you forgot about Jarhead didn't you... After 2005's Jarhead, which I myself loved, 1917 is a hugely ambitious step up for Mendes. He has to be commended for using this 'one shot' technique for what seems to be it's perfect use.
.
Believe the hype. 1917 is this years Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, Dunkirk. It's 100% fitting that it's in the conversation surrounding these war greats.The use of the one shot technique for this type of film is genius, as it completely immerses you in the action with little reprieve. Seemingly menial moments like following these two young men walking through the trenches is enthralling & captivating. This is also superbly elevated by the pitch perfect score that is coursing through the veins of the film. Honestly, the score is impeccable, goosebumps a plenty... and the Oscar for best score goes to Thomas Newman, 1917. Then there's Roger Deakins cinematography. Need I say more. It's stunning from start to finish, with some scenes very reminiscent of 2049.
.
Let's get some minor flaws out of the way. Dean-Charles Chapman (Tommen from GOT) was the wrong casting for this one. A) he's a little too chubby for this role. It's even eluded to at the start there is no food around, yet Blake looks very well fed. Chapman also doesn't nail some of the important scenes, which takes some of the emotional punch away from them. The only other thing to mention might be the fact the Germans can't seem to aim to save their lives. It did start to feel a little hard to believe at times.
.
George MacKay does a wonderful job as the lead. He hits all the right notes of emotion and intensity. There's also a bunch of great cameo appearances spread throughout the film, including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Andrew Scott in a great little scene where a few smiles are to be had.
.
1917 is a movie that demands to be seen on the big screen, the biggest screen. It's definitely one of the best films of the year, and an amazing effort in cinema.",9,38,85,6 December 2019
