The Blair Witch Project," Scary? Yes. Scariest ever? No.
","Although I commend Haxan films for delivering a very original horror film to the big screen, I can't say that it was 'The scariest movie I've ever seen,' as some of the other movie critics out there have claimed. Before you say it's because I've been jaded by the likes of Jason, Freddy Krueger, et. al., let me tell you that I saw the 1963 version of 'The Haunting' last weekend and it had me more scared than this, and like this movie, it was used very little in the way of 'special effects.' Anyway, my recommendation is to see this movie because it is an interesting concept and for a few good edge-of-your-seat moments, but don't expect to be frightened witless.",7,1,1,17 July 1999
