Blade Runner 2049," Expensive art film marketed poorly to get its money back.
","The P.H. Metric 78.75/100 The P.H. Metric +Marketing: 68/100In short if you want an art movie go, if you want an action movie and entertainment stay away.*********************************Light spoilers********************************Marketed as an action film this artistic thriller did not serve the general public. During my showing 7 people walked out, and there was only probably 15 of us, and they made it no more 50 minutes in. Several people I went to the theatre with fell asleep, yet critically applauded and here comes the divide. Movies critics love, film does not make money even when they have huge investment and movies critics don't love film makes enough money to fund 5-15 more movies. So in short this film is a disservice, because ultimately fewer studios are willing to take the risk on artsy films and all this film needed was to tighten up its pacing and it would have probably broken even and in terms of cinematic vision that is hardly selling your soul.Directing: 8.75/10The directing is superb and I am shocked with the level of investment that Villeneuve was given as much control as he was. Though it must be said that this film draws out shots for too long and this is from a man who loved the film Stalker. Where as something like Stalker is completely about the philosophical nature this film still tries to make it self an action/thriller/mystery film and these long takes end up killing the mystery and feels more like there is not enough story to go around, which ultimately is true. The shots themselves are lovely.Acting: 7/10Ford is Ford the man is not that great of an actor and he really is just cashing in on old franchises at this point. Gosling's muted touch was decent enough and while Leto's weird character was weird in a good way the character itself was unneeded. The main villain of the piece was over the top and worthy of being in a film that is trying so hard to be nuanced. She ends up coming off as a jarring screeching noise.Cinematography: 10/10Deakins's cinematography shines, absolutely shines and this has to be his year. 13 noms and with Lubezki currently attached to a special award Oscar his major comp for the year is not there.Editing 8.5/10I feel bad for Joe Walker he kept the ship as tight as he could throughout, but ultimately due to the nature of these long drawn out takes that it feels like he was ultimately overruled when it came to where to cut the film.Score/sound effects: 5.5/10I would have scored this higher if I had not seen Arrival, where as the industrial style sound design should have been more engaging I could not help feeling they were reusing it from Arrival. Of course the sounds were meant to be jarring given all the silence we were fed, but ultimately it feels like that opening sequence in the remake of Funny Games, it is not shocking or jarring in the sense the creator wants, but more in the sense please turn down the TV those noises are starting to give me a headache.Visual Effects: 9/10I get a sense of Silent Hill (the first game) it feels like the fog and dust in certain scenes is there to hide rather than enhance and when one goes back to the original Blade Runner these modern effects (specifically shots of the city) do not look like the technology has really pushed the boundaries, in fact it looks more like the status quo, which mind you the status quo is excellent, but not genre defining.Writing: 3/10I am sad to find out there was a writer for this film. Now I previously mentioned Stalker which is similar in many regards, however the dialogue in that is profound, where is the dialogue in Blade Runner 2049 thinks it is. With such cliché android film lines as basically sacrificing yourself is the way to prove you are human. This concept never sits well with me, as apparently for an android the most human thing is to sacrifice yourself so that the human may continue to live a better life than you. That sounds like the kind of thing an android would be programmed to do. Asimov anybody? Everything just keeps pushing the fact that these androids want to be human, but ultimately it keeps slapping them down and saying they are not. It adds nothing to the greater debate over AI and ultimately when compared to the sheer quality of everything else in the film it looks out of place and useless, as if someone was brought in last minute to patch it up. Secondly the whole it could be him story was let out of the back to early on, so it made the double twist so predictable that it steals any power it had.Production Design: 9.5/10Those in production design you all need more respect and deserve to be pushed further into the foreground, because when you do an excellent job no one says anything, only look how well this and that is, but you owned this film.Costume Design 9/10Well done, especially Leto's character, though I will say the only real negative was Wright's outfit. What is this 2049 and she is channelling the 50's or was she literally a copy of the police chief from Futurama. Also Ford's was a little meh.Make-up/Hairstyle 8.5/10Again Leto is the high point, but not much else as everything is high quality, but nothing feels astounding.",8,1,6,30 October 2017
Us," Dear Jordan Peele
","You are never going to read this, but yet I still must say, you are an excellent filmmaker. US deserves praise, from how it was shot, to the sound save for your use of NWA in the house. However, two movies in and what you got applauded for in Get Out is your demise in US. Your storytelling is poor. Your characters are great. I love Winston Duke's turn as a nerdy, lovable father. Two horror movies in and no scares. Weak structure with uneven storytelling, that does not really understand where it wants to go. You have amazing skills, but writing is not one of them. Find yourself a writing partner ASAP.",6,0,1,7 March 2020
Aquaman," Jame Wan still does not understand physics.
","The P.H. Metric 60.5/100 The P.H. MetricIn short, Fast and the Furious logic and storytelling in water, but I am sure that is what people are expecting, so enjoy.*********************************Light spoilers********************************Directing: 6/10The directing is decent there is a reason Wan keeps getting big budget jobs, but it is only a little bit more than average as it slams everything in your face. Wan's directing style is more like a comedy that continually keeps firing jokes at you so that you will forget any of the ones that did not work and only focus on the fun stuff.Acting: 3/10Not sure if it was the actors or the script, but for the most part, it was very hammy as they say and I am sorry did they read the script and go wow we are recreating a cheesy 1980's action flick let us cast Lundgren in it so that we can show how meta we are. (Also the cheesy 80's style songs as well.)Cinematography: 6/10I love cinematography it is probably my favourite aspect of a film, but I cannot entirely agree with the shots in this film. For example, the shot when the two are on the boat with the sun over Aquaman's right shoulder. I would not take a personal photo that has the sun burning out my retinas why would I think to put it in my film. Again the action is used to hide the framing and use of the shots, but ultimately it is far from stellar especially in the undersea war near the end.Editing 8/10Editing feels reasonably tight. You can see a few times where it could have been tweaked. A slight pet peeve of mine is when you know the camera just got rocked by a colossal set-piece run amok, which breaks the illusion of the experience and reminds me that I am not immersed.Score/sound effects: 8/10Sound effects team. Excellent job, no fault there. Score, not so much it comes off as cheesy and a throwback to a time that mainstream blockbusters have long forgotten.Visual Effects: 9.5/10Visual effects team did a great job and they deserve all the credit in this film. Not writing, not directing, not any other factor. If people love this film in any way it is down to the visual effects. Great job.Writing: 1/10Wow! Did someone steal a script from a 1980's Arnold film and say that is good enough because that is what it feels like. Everything is cliche. Everything. Right down to the kiss the two leads share during the war scene, and she does the left leg lift.Production Design: 7/10Was decent enough, but the details were not there. I suppose that can be forgiven given what the director was asking of you.Costume Design 7/10The people I went to the theatre with literally said ewww, when they saw the costumes, and they loved this film. Again not sure if these designs were forced on the department or not, but they seemed to miss the mark.Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10I want to give them a ten for Kidman. They made her appear exceptionally young, but there were little hiccups here or there, and a little bit of age would have been appreciated on her character. Especially toward the end as the comparison when her and her partner hug at the end seemed quite odd.",6,11,66,9 December 2018
Dunkirk," Silent Era War Film that relies on sound
","The P.H. Metric 82/100Directing: 9/10The directing takes a hit, not because of Nolan's efforts, but because of the script supervisor who I place in the directing section. Within the opening bombing of the film, (aside from PG-13ing something that should have been utterly horrific) the beach that was just blasted with several bombs does not seem to have taken a strike in any form. The men laying on the ground have no blasts sites near them or anything of that nature and this same issue reappears through out the film.As for Nolan from the moment we hit the beach and you see that shot taken of those two wooden pillars you can feel the influence of silent era films, which gives Dunkirk a completely different delivery to 99% of the other war films out there.Acting: 6/10Due to the film be shot in the vein of a silent film the acting did not need to be perfect and the sheer lack of dialogue presented Nolan with the chance to cast near unknowns which added to the depth of the film and the soldiers naivete, however what little acting was on display did not amount to any grand gesture of the art, but instead more akin to Bicycle Thieves.Cinematography: 9/10Superb, not Lubezeki great, but excellent none the less (also I should divulge I am a huge Cinematography nerd) I have been a fan of Hoytema's work since Låt den rätte komma in and he continues to impress with some of his most exquisite work to date.Editing 9/10Superb, couple of shots that did not quite gel as well as they should but ultimately the editing is on point and delivers action in just the right manner.Score: 10/10Hans Zimmer's score is pulse pounding and on point in every frame of the film, from start to finish it will leave you a sense dread that the film itself never truly captilaises on, but that is in no way the fault of Zimmer. Nolan's use of the Shepard tone was brilliant and really gives life to the piece.Visual Effects: 9/10Are stunning and capture the world perfectly, but this like many of Nolan's other films are due to his love of practical effects and I tend to agree if they are done correctly, you get a better quality image that does not age near as horribly.Writing: 5/10The film takes a heavy hit in terms of the writing, what with the script running a lean 76 pages. I can appreciate the improvised nature Nolan was trying to create, as war is chaos and there are no heroes spewing golden lines of perfection, however the lines that were on display were unrelentingly movie-esque to the point that the sense of realism that he was trying to portray with the improvisation gets washed away in a sea tropes.Production Design 8/10Again only for the pedantic but there are host of anachronisms that plague the film and several shots with buildings that should not be there, that really feel like production design and costume design issues.Costume Design 8/10Again only for the pedantic but there are host of anachronisms that plague the film and several shots with buildings that should not be there, that really feel like production design and costume design issues.Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10Make-up had an easy run on this film when compared to many modern war films, but for what they did contribute they did a great job. No awards obviously, but they came out and made sure that everything looked decent.",8,0,7,4 October 2017
Gone with the Wind," Directing
","Amazingly shot and directed, with poor pacing. That is Gone with the Wind. It is the Titanic of its day, financially viable, idealised and romanticised to levels that only Hollywood can bring and given that the source material is basically one of the world's first harlequin romance novels it is impressive what Fleming achieves and nothing should take away from the skill he exhibited, but ultimately the movie is lacking in knowledge of the time period (but given the history of films that is to be expected) and in its writing which is not something a movie based on a book should ever fail at, but we have all seen countless poor films spun from decent literature.",7,1,5,17 July 2017
Schindler's List," Tragedy in the Mainstream
","The P.H. Metric 91/100 Directing: 9/10A masterclass in direction. Spielberg's connection to the source material pushed him to make something that defies any sort of dilettante criticisms. Every decision from the black and white to the stones hits hard and hits well. Leaving the viewer with a piece that is entertaining, yet horrifically beautiful as well as being the sort of thing any student of cinema should be studying.Acting: 9/10Liam Neeson's best role, before he revealed to the world that method acting is not something he subscribes to, which in turn means Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson every time. The rest of the cast offers more nuanced performances that really provide the viewer with a subdued approach to such horrors, allowing the audience to feel disconnected from the tragedy, yet thrust into its dark world.Cinematography: 10/10Red, red, red. Visually perfect.Editing 10/10Editing makes a film, it cannot be said enough. Actors and the like get the credit, but editors along with the writers and directors are the heart, spine and brain of a film and this film only furthers to reinforce the fact that actors are far from needed to meld a film into something sublime.Score: 10/10Williams provides another stellar score, which raises the question would Spielberg's films be as successful with out them? That said, Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.Visual Effects: 8/10The shower scene aside, the visual effects are done well and kept in the century they are meant to be in and keeps the viewer planted firmly in the time period.Writing: 8/10The writing is superb, however it does have one to many touches of the Hollywood penmanship to it, which does cause the film to drift into a territory that feels a little unnatural for the artistic intentions of the piece.Production Design 9/10Superb production design, save for a few touches in the concentration camps.Costume Design 9/10Authentic and eye catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes.Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10Several hairstyles feel off for the period and the make-up department does benefit greatly from the black and white.",9,42,75,4 October 2017
The Lion King," Deja vu
","Honestly whatever you rated the first movie rate this one the same minus one. So much so in the opening sequence, I was worried we were going to Gus Van Sant remake.
The film is not really worth seeing in theatres. I would wait until it comes out on Netflix or Disney's streaming service, which I imagine is what all these live-action remakes that came out in 2019 were for. Ultimately it is bland and boring with a lot of the humour taken out of it, still no acknowledgement as far as I noticed to Hamlet or Kimba. The American actors, save for Jones who is Mufasa and Glover who did well with what was there, were the weakest part, Eichner especially. The non-Americans outshined their counterparts and gave their characters depth even though they had so few lines.
Ultimately the movie is underwhelming, and I would have liked to have seen more African born actors playing roles rather than singers with limited range.",5,57,134,12 July 2019
The Elephant Man," Above average movie with an exceptional performance and make-up
","A pleasant film lifted to new heights by the exceptional performance of John Hurt and the beautifully crafted make-up of Christopher Tucker. One should watch it simply for those two aspects alone. Hopkins puts in an average performance as his character feels far two dimensional even with the depth they try to give him. Lynch does Lynch things when it is unneeded, though at the time they would have looked avant-garde today they are Lynch things meaning someone who tries to be different but ultimately keeps doing the same thing. Thankfully he did not do too many of them and the movie keeps a steady grasp on reality. The script seems a little heavy handed in its sentimentality, it also feels like it was punched up so that the audience does not 'get bored' which ultimately leaves a piece meant to discuss the nature of humanity but a brief glimpse at the strength of the human spirit.",7,0,0,7 June 2016
Big Hero 6," The Man in the High Castle the later years
","Real rating: 6.7/10 The intentions of the writers might not have been to link to K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle, but a Japanese controlled San Francisco is bound to invite that comparison. Which gives the film a horrendous back story that it never intended, but still infiltrates the viewers mind. Could they not have kept them in Japan like in the comics? That said the animation team should be patting themselves on the back, this is a masterclass in human emotion and natural movements which most animated films still have yet to get right two years later. Which if one were to view solely for the animation then yes it was deserving of its Oscar. However if we take the writing into account, then this is a cliché within a cliché that leads to a point where the villain gets rewarded for his endeavours, while the good guys might save the day, they are the one's who ultimately lost more. The work was predictable as predictable gets and one could see everything before it happened, so if you are a future animation student watch and enjoy, if you are anyone else, then it is average at best.",6,0,3,25 March 2017
Prisoners," Love = Wrath
","Real rating: 7.8/10 Those who love dearly are destined to be victims of wrath, a true yet cynical thought. A decently paced thriller for its length struggles with the weird morals of its characters, or lack thereof in 80% of the cast, as well as their inability to see that they are all prisoners to their own ideals, beliefs, desires and wants. They are inhumane creatures being portrayed as humane and no better example of this is the wife character thanking god for one of the most heinous atrocities an average human could conduct. The acting, while a touch over the top in scenes, is stellar, the cinematography is excellent and the directing superb, the writing is actually the let down, though it feels like it shouldn't be and most will be able to gloss over this as we the viewer tend to accept weaker writing so long as our emotional strings are being played eloquently.",7,1,1,25 August 2016
