Scarface," Possibly the Greatest?
","I honestly cannot believe that this is 233 in the list of the greatest movies. how Shocking is this? This film is a bench mark in the film industry!!! Al Pacino's performance as crime lord Tony Montana is such a class act that his performance alone should have put it into the top 30. But the way he acts in the film with other actors should have it rated much higher!! This film should at least be in the top 5. The final scene in the film before he dies is unbelievable where he single handedly kills at least ten people while being shot about 15 times, but in the end it took a rat to come from behind and shoot Tony Montana in the back!!",10,0,2,31 July 2006
