Howl's Moving Castle," A GREAT FILM, Worth Seeing
","this film is the fourth of Hao Miyazaki films that i have seen. Other's are: Spirited Away, Naussica of the valley of the Wind, and Castle in the Sky. All of them that i have seen have left me wanting so much more. i sat their and watched it twice in a row last night. They are all masterpieces that i would highly recommend. But at the same time they have deep intricate plots. that require thinking. Not everything is just laid out for you. It also contains a great all-star cast. It is a pleasure to listen to Christian Bale's voice as howl. He brings so much life to the character. Same thing with Billy Crystal. He adds some comic relief and his character makes you laugh on the floor. I really enjoyed this film. And i think that you will too.s you laugh on the floor. I really enjoyed this film. And i think that you will too.",10,3,6,24 June 2006
