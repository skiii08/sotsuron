Moneyball," I loved it - you might not
","Being a baseball fan and longtime reader of The Baseball Abstract by Bill James, this was a movie I knew there was a good chance I would like. Having now seen it, I'm happy to report that it did not disappoint.Billy Beane's application of baseball metrics I had long believed in and then experiencing success with it was a vindication of the way I looked at baseball (often to the derision of my other baseball fan friends). As such, this is an engrossing and compelling story to me. I remember well the details and actual people involved. Given all that, it could still have been done poorly but, happily, it was not.Brad Pitt is compelling as Beane and Jonah Hill is a scene stealer as Peter Brand, the nerdy statistics analyst who serves as Beane's inspiration to try something different and then his right hand man. Some of the peripherals of the story (Beane's personal life, for instance) could have been tightened up but serve to chronicle the pressure on Beane from all sides as his new approach fails miserably at first.The movie kept me interested throughout and told a story I already knew in a compelling way, at least to me who knew the background. A word of warning, though, my family who saw it with me was evenly divided between sports fans and non-sports fans, with the non-sports fans finding it boring and way too long.",8,0,2,10 October 2011
Trainspotting," It will grow on you
","I finally got around to watching this movie to see what all the fuss was about. I will admit that upon the first viewing, like many others who have reviewed it here, I did not like the film that much. I could see where it was going for laughs but I couldn't get too far past my visceral reaction to seeing people shoot up heroin. Plus, I'll admit I had some difficulty following it with the thick Scottish brogue.However, upon a second viewing,I picked many more things up and it got to be much more humorous and clever, albeit still quite dark. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you can get yourself to look at it the right way, then the language and even the sex doesn't seem gratuitous but even integral to the movie.Robert Carlyle is great as Begbie (I love the scene in the bar where he's recounting his game of pool with Tommy). It's really hard to believe that this is the same actor who played Renard in the The World is Not Enough just two years later. Ewan MacGregor simultaneously plays repulsive and engaging very well. Kelly Macdonald's speech outside the nightclub to him is also one of the film's better moments.In all, it gets richer and richer with successive viewings. It will never be everyone's cup of tea, but it's worth the attention its received.",8,0,0,26 February 2010
Spectre," We've been here before, haven't we?
","I am a big Bond fan and was disappointed that I hadn't had a chance to see this installment (which looked great in the promos) until last weekend.While I wouldn't call this a disappointment by any stretch I would characterize it as formulaic. In some ways the picture is so busy paying homage to the Bonds of days gone by (including every one of Daniel Craig's turns) that it comes off a bit plug and play. Even the fight scenes come off as overly choreographed. The sense is that something from a previous Bond movie is being re-enacted at almost every turn.None of that is to say that this is not a hugely entertaining movie - it is. Daniel Craig does Bond better than just about anybody else whose tried aside from Sean Connery and he is in fine form here. Little things like the adjustment of his cuff links prior to pursuing and killing a target just ooze Bond style. If the scenes are familiar there is also a comfort in that. Bond as renegade outside the system is getting a little tired (see Quantum of Solace), though. Gadgets (and gadget cars) make a comeback in this installment as well to great effect. That said car ultimately ends up at the bottom of the Tiber River is also classic Bond. Other familiar elements include a hulking villain and a train fight with said villain (hello From Russia with Love). There is even a cameo by the same model Rolls Royce that Goldfinger drove. Christoph Waltz as the villain is quietly menacing which he does as well here as in Inglorious Basterds. However, his screen time is all too brief and Bond's foiling his Moroccan fortress comes all too easily and unbelievably. Lea Sedoux is great as an archetypical Bond girl. Monica Belucci's turn is surprisingly short given the buildup. Bond's comrades including Ralph Fiennes' M do a credible job but they, too, feel a bit set piece. One of the things that does standout about this film is the cinematography. From Rome at night to snowy Alps to the Moroccan desert the scenery is gorgeous and well shot.In short this is a good but not great and certainly not original Bond film. Worth the watch but keep your expectations in line.",7,5,10,30 November 2015
Up in the Air," Over-hyped and too subtle as satire
","Given the relentless marketing that accompanied this movie into theaters, expectations are necessarily going to be high. Unfortunately, for me those expectations set the bar too high for something I might have found more enjoyable absent the hype.Part of what made it hard for me to enjoy this movie was that virtually every character was over the top. On reflection, I see that that they were, in fact, caricatures and not meant to be believable characters. However that satirical aspect was a bit too subtle and they all came across as simply 'jumping the shark', as it were. It wasn't billed as satire, it was billed as a tour de force for George Clooney and, as such, it falls somewhat short.Seen in the right frame of mind, I think this movie could be an enjoyable diversion. However, if you are expecting the movie of the year (or a feel good movie), you'll likely be disappointed.",6,7,13,28 June 2010
