3:10 to Yuma," Quite good but something was lacking.
","I enjoy my westerns. I quite enjoyed this one, but something seemed to be missing. I felt it fell down in the second act, and got a bit messy there.It did however manage to recover and ended strongly. Seemed to lack direction in the middle, not from the director, but just, as too where it was going.Strong performances from both Crowe and Slater, which when they came together, really picked the film up. They played off each other well.Nice effects and shot well. Pretty good, but I think modern Western's need something extra to lift them. Classic case of a slight lack of pacing in the second act.Well worth a view though.",7,0,0,26 January 2009
Tangled," A Disney Classic of old.
","Well this was about as good as it gets. Great story, beautifully told, great pacing, lots of funny moments and characters. Some very touching moments too. It really does have it all. Drama, romance, obstacles etc. The best film I've seen in ages. There some goodies around at the moment too. Great for all the family.I love how good Disney are at getting the audience onside with their characters. They are masters of this. Anyone with a soft spot for the good old Disney films will be well satisfied after seeing this. Great voice actors too. I take my hat off to the actors that give these characters so much life and believability. I will definitely be adding this to my Blu Ray collection. It's a gem.",10,7,10,6 February 2011
The Dark Knight," Should be title ' The Joker'.
","I was a more then a little disappointed by this film. Probably too high an expectation thrown out by the media, in the months prior to it's arrival.Isn't Batman a super hero? I can take it when Batman has the odd glitch and has to work a bit harder to get the villain, but when the joker makes him look so ordinary, then for me, the super hero is not so super any more.Heath Ledger's performance was outstanding. I do wonder if the edit was heavily influenced, by Heath's death. If it has been I guess, that's a nice sign of respect for Ledger and I can understand that. But in the end this is so much more a Joker film then it is a Batman film.Well shot of course and some nice effects, etc, But I went to the movies to see a Batman Super hero film and came out disappointed that Batman had been made to look so ordinary.A also came out very sad, that Heath Ledger doesn't get to show us a whole lot more of what he was so good at. It would seem as if he was really starting to hit his mark. A tragedy that we lost him so young.",7,3,7,26 January 2009
WALLÂ·E," Masterfull
","I love how quickly Pixar are able to get us on board with Wall-E the character.Very smart film making. Very clever controlled use of sound. Stunning in so many ways.I wish Pixar would employ 2000 more animator's and put out a new film every 3 months. We all wait far too long between Pixar films, or life is too short or something.I know how many man hours go into these films, and you people at Pixar must be so dam proud of the amazing films you make. All the audiences in the world are so enriched by them.Take a bow you geniuses. You guys are truly amazing.",10,3,6,26 January 2009
The Queen," A fine film
","I hadn't been in a hurry to see this film, though when I did finally view it , I was very surprised with how good it was. The audience got a very convincingly real look at the royal family from a very human perspective. Helen Mirren was really quite outstanding in her portrayal of the Queen, as was Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. The rest of the cast too, well deserve a mention for their individual portrayals of the numerous characters surrounding this story. All made the film very believable. I take my hat off to the director, who boldly took on a monumentous task of creating this sensitive story with honesty and respect, and for being able to maintain a feeling of realism, without, badly offending those, whose lives this was about. A difficult task, given that this was based on a true story of recent history, with the monarch still living and indeed still at the thrown. Great story, well written, and beautifully shot and acted. The pacing was very good, and a few tender moments thrown in for good measure. A fine effort, and well worth viewing. This movie will be awarded a significant place in my film library. 9/10.",9,0,1,16 February 2009
