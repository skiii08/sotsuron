The King's Speech," Straight-Forward-Kitsch (why not?)
","The labelling 'kitsch' may be too critical. But this film has no reluctance whatsoever to indulge in melodramatic stereo-types (e.g. it's use of music, of historical characters (e.g. Churchill), the narrative structure of the hero who overcomes his impairs with the help of an adviser and so forth).Having said that - the film partially manages to engage the viewer. Even though its classical narrative structure makes the film totally predictable. But overall I don't like the film because:1) it is so obviously a Oscar vehicle 2) it pretends to be some kind of historical piece - but it's obviously royal kitsch. The story could been taken from any average royals-magazine (it has to be said though, that screenplays can employ trash-story-lines and make wonderful films out of it - but here it isn't the case). 3) it is only engaging in the beginning. Towards the middle the conflict between the king and its adviser turns out to be rather constructed/ artificial - to create some kind of suspense. 4) with 8.3 points it is terribly overrated (though the acting is marvelous)",5,4,9,18 September 2011
District 9," Moralistic, boring story without any irony!
","I gave that film only four points for two reasons: First it is totally overrated. And i am wondering: if it comes down to recently released, successful movies, the rating is often too good, whereas classic, older movies are rated adequately.So why is the film bad? It's easy to understand, as it has the typical problem, many action films have: it lacks originality. And therefore: the action parts are of no interest at all, for the viewer. They are just the bitter pill, the viewer has to swallow, if he wants to see the unsurprising ending of the film.The clich√©s - which unfortunately undergo no variations - are the following: The main character: a naive, stupid man becomes the world saving hero.The story line: the hero is in need of a substance, which will save his health, and return him to his beloved, family home (his wife is only sobbing and crying at home - what a character !!!). And: he befriends himself with an alien, who is - after all - not a bad creature. So: we've got an moral issue here: not only human have human rights! Then the antagonists: a bad weapon corporation, which is only interested in profit (seen thousands of times!), a racist military squad, which hunts the protagonist throughout 45 minutes of the movie (this last bit appallingly boring; the main dialogue line: f* and the toting of a machine gun), and a group of colored people, who engage in voodoo (!) and criminal business and which is also after the protagonist. (This part is from an ethical point of view especially bad, as it is - in my opinion - an obviously racist stereotype, which lacks even the slightest bit of irony).So while the first third of the film is still alright - it is a comedy or satire, reminding a bit on Starship Troopers - it becomes towards the end sickeningly moralistic. The problem with that is from my point of view: the film leaves nothing to the viewer; rather the parts between good and bad are traditionally divided, and the viewer can reassure himself after the movie, that there are some bad guys (corporations, criminals, racist) and some good guys (the everyday guy, the John Doe or whatever you wanna call him), and that he himself - as a viewer - surely would choose the good side.",4,0,4,7 September 2009
