The Longest Yard," Worst Movie Ever.
","I normally never call a movie the Worst Movie Ever. It's just not a line you toss around liberally like that. Worst Movie Ever is a title saved for only the absolutely most painfully bad movie possible. I don't think I previously had an occupant to the title Worst Movie Ever, but I now most certainly do. The Longest Yard remake is the Worst Movie Ever. So much so, that Worst Movie Ever must be capitalized. It was painful. Or perhaps the fact that I actually heard laughs in the audience was more painful. I can't tell. Either way, I had to physically remove myself from the theater before the last 10 minutes because I thought I was going to cry, it was so bad. Every single joke was almost directly taken from another movie, and every single plot turn, character, lousy dialog, and even every camera angle was unoriginal. Even the music played throughout was atrocious. I cannot believe anyone could have made this movie. I have lost a thorough amount of respect for the human race. Ew. Please save yourself the 10 bucks (though I'm HAPPY to say I didn't pay for it.)",1,6,12,30 May 2005
Sin City," The best adaptation of a graphic novel...EVER.
","One of the greatest movies of all time. For those who haven't read the books, by seeing this movie you have essentially read three stories in the series. Amazing. Brilliant. The movie reads like a comic. Frank Miller revolutionized comics by making them cinematic. This movie has revolutionized movies by making them comic-atic. If you are interested in comics or graphic novels, go see the movie. Then go buy the graphic novel. The acting may not be incredible by regular standards, but it is incredible when you take into account that they are acting comic book characters. These people aren't real, they are bound to paper (and colored by ink). Go see it.",10,1,3,8 April 2005
