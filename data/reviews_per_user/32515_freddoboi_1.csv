Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is a purely British comedy
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is probably the funniest film i have ever seen! it is a very British film as it takes the Micky out of the American way of life which most Brits find hilarious. Being a Brit myself, i do find it hilarious but i don't know why some of the Americans find it SO offencive, cant they take a joke? there are many films that take the Micky out of the British way of life and we don't care too much. Anyway, back on the film, Sacha Baron Cohen is the perfect man for the Job as he himself is Jewish, and in the film, the Kazakhs are scared of Jewish people which adds Irony to it which sends us off laughing from the off! He has also been in other side-splitting British films such as Ali G Indahouse which was also a big hit with the Brits, mainly the younger generations found it the funniest as it was about a teenage 'chav' that found himself as the Prime Minister's 'left hand man'. If your have seen these two movies then you should agree with me that Sacha Baron Cohen really IS the perfect British Comedian.",10,1,7,7 September 2007
