Hereditary," Worth it.
","Brilliant use of imagery and foreshadowing. The cast is phenomenal. 
The movie is a ritual, not a series of events. Tense and disturbing, you won't see the end coming.",9,168,309,29 August 2018
The Thing," Pure terror.
","In my opinion probably one of the greatest movies ever made. The casting, the effects, acting(that husky! ), the setting. From beginning to end, every time i watch this movie, I'm on the edge of my seat. Do yourself the favor and watch.",10,2,5,20 September 2018
