Blade Runner 2049," Hmm a Cyborb Love Story
","There was a lot of time wasted on building characters and showcasing what future technology may look like , hello we are in the 21st Century, we get it. Get on with the movie plot already, I don't care for a long debate that a cyborg has no soul. The movie should have moved passed the givens, like Star Wars does, and though Star Wars leaves you wanting more, I really don't want to see more Blade Runners, give me an ending or evolve somehow if you're going to do another sequel. One can argue the movie stayed true to itself about future dystopian advertising, but I don't care about that, I would rather understand why having a piece of wood would make you rich or how we got to a dystopia state in the first place and showcase the villain as the state not as a separate entity.",6,14,33,6 October 2017
Wind River," A must see for our generation
","Incredible animal references such as the week deer, I interpret this like the American president watching the movie and saying, 'yes Indians are week' yet he has a chance to really change things for the American Indian but does little; it is really survive or surrender, there is no lucky. The intertwine of nature and scenery is brilliant and makes you feel part of the experience, very powerful images and very powerful messages.",9,1,4,21 September 2017
