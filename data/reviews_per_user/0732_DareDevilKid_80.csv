The Avengers," There Was The Anticipation! There Were The Expectations! There Was The Hype! And.....Boy Did It Deliver!!!
","Movie Review: The Avengers (2012) by DareDevilKid.DDKMy Rating: 8.5/10Yes! Oh, boy did this movie deliver! Its like all the cogs fitted perfectly in a well oiled mechanism. Director Joss Whedon has made a brilliant transition from the small to the big screen. The Director has delivered a classic Action/Adventure film of epic proportions. And this was no little achievement, considering all the legendary characters of folklore mostly possessing their individual blockbusters - some really good and some plain mediocre -, which were amalgamated into one huge vista.All the superheroes & even the super-villain merge into the plot beautifully and appear exactly at the opportune moments. Even a somewhat throwaway hero like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) feels vital. Her fight scenes are Buffy cool. Hemsworth and Evans are more relaxed, more comfortable in their spandex skin. If there's an underused super it's Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) but in the last act he impresses, too.But The true standout is The Hulk. Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner pulls off the trick of allowing his inner rage to simmer just below the surface the whole time. And when the green dude shows up, stand back and just enjoy. He's the first version of Hulk to make his burst of power feel so gratifying. His destructive nature is infectious. Also an honorable mentions have to bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man & Chris Hemsworth's - he's really growing with each passing film - Thor, who adequately support Mark Ruffalo and his alter-ego throughout the movie.The Avengers looks great. The reportedly $250 million budget is on the screen. Many scenes have a great deal of variety. Not just well- choreographed action, there's a cleverness to the very idea to many of the scenes. Whedon pushes his heroes to their limits. When your script can put demigod Thor in peril that's incredible.The plot is simple yet effective - Thor's evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston - a slimy megalomaniac) has taken a cube called the Tesseract that harnesses limitless energy and aliens from another dimension intend to invade Earth to get it. Its easy to follow and merges well into the narration to let the film deliver what audiences really want to see - these ultimate superheroes becoming a team and kicking much butt.The action is magnanimous, the CGI effects are dazzling but ushered only when required, great and witty one-liners are interspersed intermittently, the humor is enthralling, the set-pieces are brilliant, each character is painstakingly developed, the narration is crisp and finally but most importantly, the action makes sense - a rarity for action adventure movies nowadays - in a way that you follow each minutest detail even while its bursting on screen at the rate of knots. The action occurs only after enough plot and character detailing and even when it occurs, it smoothly takes the plot forward. This rare feat elevates Whedon as the real superhero of this film.'The Avengers' reminds us of the reason we love movies ant buy tickets for admittance in a cinema hall. It will keep drawing you back for more, as viewing it just once is insulting and will leave you just plain unsatisfied. The euphoria you experience after completing this exalting visual odyssey will settle only after many long hours and then the realization will ultimately dawn - that you have been privileged to witness an classic that will be indelibly etched in cinematic archives.",10,5,11,6 May 2012
The Monuments Men," Splendid Opportunity Gone Begging
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3/5 stars'The Monuments Men' takes an immensely exciting subject on paper and then proceeds to toe a fine line between serving it in a deserved enthralling manner and almost ruining its brilliant concept by presenting it in deliberately dreary fashion, bordering on the verge of being pretentiously somber and unintentionally tedious. Alas, while oscillating between these two extremities, the film fortunately or unfortunately falls into a vacuum of modestly engaging storytelling, where the viewer's attention is just about held with some sporadically inspiring scenes and tense moments.Donning the Director's mantle, Clooney surprisingly misses many a trick by not delving deeper into a plot that presented numerous possibilities for an engrossing WWII mission in the vein of such classics as 'The Guns of Navarone', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'Inglorious Basterds', and 'Kelly's Heroes' to name a few. Sadly, Clooney ends up desperately clinging to a few well-executed scenes towards the climax, to save his film from being a complete disaster. Moreover, his lackluster direction is astutely shielded by a stellar ensemble cast, who each perform admirably well in their grossly underwritten roles.Based on a truly motivational true story, 'The Monuments Men' could have easily turned out to be a much more entertaining if not classic war movie with better planning and prudent execution. Alas, it ends up exposing us to an almost forgotten chapter of WWII heroism - one which was equally important as the war strategies and legendary battles in standing up against the fascist Nazi regime, especially since these gallant souls preserved our art and culture, the very essence of history and existence - even if it does so in a jarringly slipshod manner.",6,2,2,11 May 2014
The Equalizer," Fuqua and Washington Deliver Big Time
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsWith Antoine Fuqua behind the cameras and Denzel Washington dispensing justice, 'The Equalizer' is a highly stylized, violent, and engaging action film that delivers on many counts. Fuqua infuses the film with a low-key energy and is in no hurry to rush into things, which is something many action films nowadays could learn from.In 'The Equalizer', Denzel Washington plays McCall, a man who believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life. But when McCall meets Teri (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz), a young girl under the control of ultra- violent Russian gangsters, he can't stand idly by - he has to help her. Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help.Though the plot looks familiar, this familiarity can be welcome when the practitioner is so good at what he does. And there are few actors more commanding than Washington (perhaps only Neeson and Wahlberg among post 2000 action stars) when he's taking out bad guys. Washington, as always, holds your attention, finding in McCall a vulnerability that goes beyond the script's lip service. Denzel's performance and the film's high-voltage action premise make it one to watch this fall season. 'The Equalizer'is without a semblance of doubt, Fuqua's most accomplished effort along with 2001's 'Training Day' and 2013's 'Olympus Has Fallen', and should give its veteran action star his very first movie franchise.Along with 'John Wick', 'The Equalizer' is the best R-rated, stylish, brutal, gory, adult-skewed action film to emerge from the Hollywood stable this year.",8,1,8,16 December 2014
Iron Man 3," One of the worst superhero movies ever! Succeeds in tarnishing the reputation of the first two films. A total decimation of the franchise.
","The Good - RDJ is great as usual and is well supported by the remarkable Guy Pearce. Some, and only some one-liners hit the mark. The action and visual effects are a dazzling treat to behold. And that's the end of it. There is nothing else in this movie that is truly good to write home about.The Bad - Where to even begin? This is one awful movie that shall take the studio a lot of soul-searching and fundamental reworking (irrespective of how much money this movie rakes in), in order to even attempt getting this great superhero franchise back on track. The direction is so shoddy that any recently passed out film school alumnus could have done a better job. The plot, characterization, story arc, and narration is simply all over the place and meanders along a confounding, restless, and disoriented path.Hardcore comic book fans and Iron Man aficionados like me will certainly spew vitriol at seeing Mandarin - one of the greatest comic book villains and one of the fiercest adversaries of Iron Man - being reduced to a mere gimmick. The character's gross misrepresentation simply cannot be overlooked. Add to this, the character of Aldrich Killian - who in reality is nothing more than a minion and a small-time foe of Iron Man - being given superiority and control over Mandarin, and any mildly interested follower of Iron Man will begin to wonder if it would have been more prudent to hire some avid comic book fans to harness this script.Even objective moviegoers without any predilections towards the comics, will be left largely dissatisfied at the total decimation of the narrative structure. This film is like a Hollywood 'Singham' or a 'Rowdy Rathore' in a superhero mold - that's how bad it is. Its nothing but a shrewd attempt to milk the cash cow and surreptitiously deliver insipid milk in a glossy packet to the unsuspecting audiences.Those who've been comparing this rancid somnolence to 'The Avenger' and 'The Dark Knight' - two of the greatest superhero movies ever - and those who claim that 'Iron Man 3' amalgamates the tones of both the aforementioned films, have either been bribed handsomely by the producers or perhaps they have watched a completely different movie. This film is more analogous to such superhero stinkers like 'Batman & Robin', 'Catwoman', Spiderman 3', 'Green Lantern', and 'Superman Returns'.Quite simply, one of the worst superhero movies ever, and a real blemish on the reputation of the classic 1st installment and the vastly superior 2nd installment.",4,35,70,29 April 2013
Airlift," Spirits Lifted in a High-Quality Entertainer
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.8/5 stars'Airlift' is Akshay Kumar's best movie since 'Khakee' (yes, it's even better than 'Baby') and his best performance bar none. Period! Gut-wrenching scenes, high-intensity shots, crackerjack dialogues, realistic tension, and patriotic without ever skirting jingoistic shores â the movie has all this, and then some. Based on the world's largest civilian evacuation, director Raja Krishna Menon takes on the challenge of turning a story known to all into a compelling watch and pens a nail-biting screenplay along with cowriters Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair, and Rahul Nangia, which will keep you fearful, hopeful and yet, unsure and uncomfortable.Set in 1990, the film introduces us to a Kuwait-based business tycoon Ranjit Katyal (Akshay Kumar), an expat who has embraced his migrant country's ways and pointedly disassociates himself with anything Indian. When Iraqi forces commanded by Saddam Hussein invade Kuwait, the entire country is torn by war. As battle-tanks bomb the city, the progressive escalation of war finds millions displaced. A significant number of them happen to be migrant Indians. Katyal being one of the more privileged ones, instinctively plans his own exit along with wife Amrita (Nimrat Kaur) and daughter Siya (Adiba Hussain). A sudden change of heart has Katyal taking charge of the safety of his distraught employees and anyone who reaches out to him. With the country's airports sealed by the invaders, options of exiting or entering the country are eliminated. The various escape plans that Katyal devises, makes up the rest of the film. There's hardly any suspense about how this film folds up, but the events that lead up to the inevitable denouement pack in enough punches to keep you at the edge of your seat.Films like 'Khakee', 'Aankhen', 'Baby', and 'Special 26' offered ample proof of how far Akshay Kumar has come from his 'Aflatoon' days, but here he knocks it out of the park with a firm, sharp, and restrained yet emotional performance. Prudently, the filmmakers provide Nimrat Kaur with quite a meaty role to essay, and she supports Akshay exceptionally well â those acquainted with her acting prowess are well-versed with ability of essaying a range of emotions, and she executed the entire gamut here with effortless ease and conviction. All the other supporting players â particularly Inaamulhaq as a scheming, callous Iraqi Major, Prakash Belawadi as a perennially bickering refugee, and Kumud Mishra as the External Affairs bureaucrat who makes the operation possible â too, pull their weight in well-written roles.Cinematographer Priya Seth deserves a special mention for strategically framing scenes to amplify the tension. Be it the shot taken through a car's smashed windshield or the aerial ones of tanks sliding down the desert, she manages to wordlessly convey terror and compel you to imagine the devastation.I'll unequivocally declare that personally, I haven't enjoyed nor taken away so much from a Bollywood movie since 'Detective Byomkesh Bakshi' released some ten months ago. You are filled with immense pride as the narrative arc of these everyday characters with indomitable spirits unfold, and a sea of emotions well up within you without ever spilling into melodramatic territory. A few brave souls saved the lives of 170,000 Indians at great personal risk, and it's time more Indian directors started telling stories like these that highlight heroic deeds of our countrymen amid both global and national scenarios. 'Airlift' is just a brilliant movie overall, and no amount of accolades would suffice in bestowing praise on it. What a time to release it as well, coinciding with India's Republic Day. If you are in the mood to be entertained, watch 'Airlift'. If you are in the mood to be educated, watch 'Airlift'. If you are in a patriotic mood, watch 'Airlift'. You know what? Just watch 'Airlift'.",10,0,1,27 January 2016
John Wick," Keanu Reeves Goes Ballistic in this Bloody, Slick, Stylish, Cool Action Film
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 stars'John Wick' is a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days. The once popular genre, which was headlined by the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger during its heyday, has been a dying breed during the past two decades. Occasionally, a movie like 'The Raid: Redemption' (or its bigger, better sequel, 'The Raid 2: Berandal') comes along to satisfy fans with a penchant for R-rated violence, but the growing desire for PG- 13 action and the emergence of computer generated imaging has rendered old-school brutality obsolete. Then along comes unlikely candidate, Keanu Reeves, to ignite the flame once again. For those who crave no-holds barred action, this may be among the best the genre has to offer.On paper, the film is generic as generic gets: John Wick's (Keanu Reeves) wife dies of an unnamed disease (Bridget Moynahan plays the role, such as it is), and her final act on this world is to arrange for a beagle puppy to be sent to him. This is a beautiful, lifesaving act, and it lasts for two days, until a vile, boorish Russian named Iosef (Alfie Allen) wants to buy Wick's beautiful muscle car, and Wick isn't selling. So Iosef and his thug buddies break into Wick's home, steal his car, beat him bloody, and in a moment of pique, kill the dog. And it is this, which he later describes as the theft of the last hope he had in the whole world, that pushes him into a blood rage. John Wick, you see, is a retired assassin. And Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), the Russian mobster who used to be Wick's employer. And those are all the ingredients we need in a film about revenge, a cool action hero, and all-out-war against the Russian mafia.There isn't much of a plot, but that's often the case with revenge- based tales. Movies of this sort aren't about narrative depth, they're about taking a hero through an increasingly difficult series of bad guys until he comes face-to-face with the Big Boss. 'John Wick's' greatest strength is its relentless momentum. The film doesn't have a lot of down time. It offers occasional breaks, including some amusing scenes that take place in a hotel where guests aren't allowed to 'talk business.' (Breaking that rule, it turns out, can have serious consequences.) For the most part, however, 'John Wick' knows what it is and is unapologetic about it. This is a kick-butt action film with no pretensions of being anything else. There is a short dialogue about karma and God but it's neither deep nor long.Reeves is in many ways a perfect choice for the lead. When the movie begins, Wick is in a deep funk following the death of his wife. His emotions have been shut down and remain thus for most of the film as he goes about his work. Reeves has never displayed much range; his screen presence has always been his strongest asset and it's in abundant evidence here. Wick is more of a force of nature than a fully realized character. Reeves has sufficient backstory to make him sympathetic but, thankfully, his past is murky. In fact, 'John Wick' presents the best platform to showcase Reeves' enigmatic screen presence - there are vividly choreographed fights, a suave black suit for the hero, and no greater moral purchase on our rooting interest than that he's Keanu Reeves, and the bad guys killed his dog.The film was co-directed by former stuntmen/coordinators Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (DGA rules mandate that Stahelski be given sole official credit). They show a good understanding of how to frame a fight and never resort to the kind of rapid-fire cutting that reduces an action scene into visual confetti. The six or seven big action scenes feature a sleek, chic gusto and the shoot-outs are brutal and shot in longish takes rather than chopping them into short frames. The few one-on-one fights are well choreographed, and are neither overtly short nor do they drag on forever. There's a fantastic car chase scene too, and fortunately it doesn't look derivative from erstwhile action films and is constricted within the right time frame. Leitch and Stahelski may not be on the short list to direct the next Jane Austen adaptation. but they know their stuff when it comes to action films, and that's all that matters.'John Wick' is the kind of ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of. Reeves, always a nimble action presence, delivers the goods and then some. Chad Stahelski - Keanu's former stunt double - and David Leitch - Brad Pitt's former stunt double - direct with a flair for movement and framing that slams you right into the fights, stabbings, and shoot-outs. From home invasion to a hotel for assassins, the stage is set for all hell to break loose, and that it does. Moral nourishment is not on the menu, but some memorable one-liners are. Juicy supporting performances from Michael Nyqvist and Alfie Allen, and terrific cameos from Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, and Ian McShane are ample compensation in the acting department. The kick of 'Wick' is not to be denied. It's as close to a pure adrenaline rush as you're likely to find at the moment. What else does an action movie need? Action movies are about movement, and 'John Wick' pursues that goal with remorseless verve.The film is also wickedly funny, with a dry wit and upended expectations not only about the character himself but the underground world that sucks hims back in. 'John WicK' is a carnivorous thriller that wonderfully displays the immeasurable depth of one man's thirst for retribution. Stylish, thrilling, and giddily kinetic, John Wick serves as a satisfying return to action for Keanu Reeves, and what looks like could be the first of an immensely entertaining franchise.",8,9,23,21 November 2014
Gravity," A Flawed Visual Extravaganza
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 2.5/5 starsAll hoopla and no real steam. Don't care who found it astounding, or spellbinding, or whatever superlatives are being used to describe this over-indulgent soporific mess of a sci-fi drama. Now the film isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, It's just not as great as it's being made out to be, and that's what peeves me.In fact, after ages I actually felt like walking out of the cinema hall midway, and I usually don't do that for even worse movies than this. The reason being, that this movie is, plain and simple, boooooorrrrring as hell. The biggest drawback of this film is that it becomes all to predictable and static after a certain point, and that point arrives all too soon.If it wasn't for Sandra Bullock and her amazing performance, which somehow managed to salvage the disintegrating remains of 'Gravity', I actually might have walked out on the movie. Sandra Bullock is the life and soul of 'Gravity', and along with the stunning visuals, the only good thing in the entire movie. George Clooney also manages to get your attention in his surprisingly brief appearance.The visuals, while exemplary, are not worth your time and effort to sit through the lethargic proceedings. So if you do wish to catch 'Gravity' just because it's being pushed down our throats as something so cool, and contemporary, and the biggest spectacle since 'Avatar' (an infinitely superior film), then watch it for Bullock's performance and her performance alone. Sadly, even her mesmerizing and captivating act cannot make us care in the end if her character actually manages to survive the ordeal or not, only because of the painful ordeal the film itself inflicts upon us.",6,1,3,22 October 2013
Lone Survivor," A Mighty Fine War Movie
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsAn emotionally inspiring and gripping film about courage, honor, patriotism, and brotherhood. 'Lone Survivor' tells the tale of four soldiers fighting for survival behind enemy lines after a reconnaissance operation gets compromised by an unforeseen circumstance. How these bravehearts battle for their lives and how they push themselves beyond conceivable limits for the men they fight with form the rest of the proceedings. The intrepidness, tenacity, and willingness for sacrifice displayed by these brave souls leave us literally spellbound and humbled. I ended up saying to myself, 'I'm a very small human being and not all that important in the face of these great men. Whatever grand notions of courage I had about myself were quickly made to feel minuscule.'Since this is based on a true story (from a book by Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson on a real-life mission of Marcus Luttrell and his fellow Navy Seal team comprising of Michael Murphy, Matt Axelson, and Danny Dietz), you shouldn't expect many unexpected twists. Anyways, the heartfelt nature of the content and the positive impact it has on us as viewers, is enough to keep us thoroughly engaged and even entertained. Plus, the veracious sources of the movie provide ample scope for some heart-pounding action and edge-of-the-seat thrills. Credit must be given to the Director, Peter Berg, who aptly adapts this heroic tale of unflinching camaraderie and irrepressible bravado. Berg's assured hand evokes a keen sense of pride and respect for our four protagonists. Along the way, he also escalates his standing as a Director of note be delivering a film that's leagues ahead of his erstwhile passable fare.An inspiring war film with so many action scenes demands strong support from the technical departments like editing, cinematography, special effects, and sound, and 'Lone Survivor' astutely delivers on all these accounts. Performances wise, all the actors delivers true portrayals of their roles, which blend seamlessly with the script on offer. Mark Wahlberg puts in another act that does equal justice to his star value and acting credentials alike. He's ably supported by Taylor Kitsch, Ben Foster, and Emile Hirsch.'Lone Survivor' is a gripping, inspirational, and heart-crunching film on bravery, honor, determination, loyalty, and camaraderie. It's certain to go down as one of the best war films of all time.",9,3,7,18 April 2014
Fury," Well-Crafted War Film that Explores the Depths of Hell in Battle
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.3/5 starsThe first thing that you notice inn 'Fury' is the mud. Even more than the copious blood and violence, it represents the defining visual element of 'Fury'. It's everywhere. Feet are caked with it. Tires and treads churn it under. Roads - if they can be called that - are paved with it. Rarely has a World War II film depicted just how filthy everything was during the 1945 slog across Germany's rural country on the race to Berlin. If writer/director David Ayer is to be credited with nothing else, he gets this right, illustrating that, unlike what's shown in less historically exacting war films, the final push for the Allies was no post-D-Day picnic.Tanks have featured in countless war movies yet rarely been the focus of those films. Slow, hulking and claustrophobic, they lack the 'glamour' of planes, the scale of battleships and the vulnerability of the lone soldier. Two rare exceptions are 1943's 'Sahara' and 1988's 'The Beast of War', both of which centered on lone tank crews bravely engaging the enemy against seemingly impossible odds. In that vein, 'Fury' is a fitting new addition. In the closing stages of the Second World War, a single US Sherman M4 tank (baring the nickname from which the film takes its title), is tasked with holding a vital crossroads deep behind German lines. Led by their tough-as-nails sergeant, 'Wardaddy' Don Collier (Brad Pitt), the crew includes Bible-thumping Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf), pugnacious Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal), and immigrant Gordo Garcia (Michael Pena) - a hardened bunch of veterans who do not take kindly to their new, fresh-faced draftee, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), whose mobile armored experience consists of knowing how to operate a typewriter. The fifth seat in the tank, tragically vacated, is filled by this typist-turned-gunner/driver, who is as unenthused about being with the four as they are about having him there.Norman's initiation is quick and uncompromising. His first job is to wipe down the tank's interior and scrub away the fleshy remains of his predecessor. Then its straight into action, where the true horrors of the conflict are seen, felt and heard all around. One thing 'Fury' does exceptionally well is demonstrate precisely how devastating a tank was to anything less than another one (unless that other one was the German 'Tiger', whose forward-facing armor made it invulnerable to all US counterparts). 'Ideals are peaceful', explains Wardaddy, 'history is violent', and the sound of enemy shells tearing holes through the sky as they blaze past or into the American units is a terrifyingly violent experience.Indeed, all the combat scenes in 'Fury' are brutally graphic, offering a 'Saving Private Ryan' level of gruesome reality to the war experience, even if the film as a whole fall slightly short of meeting the lofty standards of Spielberg's ultimate war classic. Bodies are burned, shredded and liquefied, yet what truly startles is the matter-of-factness with which the other soldiers regard it all. This is the final stage of the conflict, remember, by which time most troops had experienced years of dehumanizing savagery. 'It's just war!' one of them explains to Norman, whose revulsion to the death around him is neatly reflective of the audience's.Brad Pitt's Don is a toned-down version of the memorable character he played in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Bastards'. Though this role might not have the same impact as the Tarantino-scripted one, it's still noteworthy for portraying Don to be just as determined and uncompromising but far less gung-ho. He lives by a code of honor with principle #1 being to keep his men alive and principle #2 follows Patton's directive about killing Nazis. In particular, he has no sympathy for the SS. The only good one is a dead one, and it doesn't matter if he has surrendered. Pitt is more than believable in this role, and completely vanishes into the character. His performance is genuinely affecting - barking orders, maintaining camaraderie, and at times being brutal to the point of risking real inhumanity, as when he forces Norman to shoot a captured German soldier in the back just to give him the experience of doling out death. Yet there are other moments when he is able to shed that horrible armor for just a few minutes, and convey a man who is terribly frightened, not only of his own possible death, but of what he may have become in keeping himself and the others alive. Logan Lerman doesn't have Pitt's screen presence, but he fills the role of the clerk-turned-warrior capably. His character has the longest and most extreme arc. Shia LaBeouf, who may or may not retire from acting after this performance, fulfills the promise that once had Hollywood insiders predicting great things from him. Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal ably fill out the quintet.David Ayer has directed a work that moves with a cinematic force; even grace. It is a difficult film to discount. From the vivid, fluid photography (Roman Vasyanov) to the mournful and muscular score (Steven Price), 'Fury' is irrefutably crafted. Over two hours long it is tense going, a sturdily acted affair, and yet, as the author of this drama, Ayer has penned a work that takes us no place new, or illuminating, or even exciting, but what it does manage to do is give us a brutally realistic war film. 'Fury' is a war movie as much as an anti-war movie, with an emphasis on the horrors of war, and which minimizes the heroic aspects of being a soldier. In this film, war really is hell.",7,1,5,9 November 2014
The Maze Runner," As Excellent an Adaptation of a Stupendous Novel as it is a Stand-Alone, Post-Apocalyptic Sci-Fi Film
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsBoasting a solid premise and a refreshingly dark approach to its dystopian setting, 'The Maze Runner' stands out from the crowded field of young-adult sci-fi adventures. It generally has ambitious production values, is well-edited, briskly paced, decently acted, action packed, and features a thumping score. More importantly, it's a fairly faithful adaptation of James Dashner's brilliantly conceived, grim novel (the first in a trilogy if you exclude the prequel that was penned later), succinctly weaved together to satiate ardent fans of the series while being coherent enough to entertain viewers with no prior knowledge of Dashner's post- apocalyptic books.The minor deviations from the source material, taken in the name of creative liberty and with a commitment to manage cinematic time constraints do not detract from the story, and instead churn a refreshing spin on proceedings for those already familiar with the story. Ultimately, 'The Maze Runner' turns out to be a thrilling sci-fi adventure with great energy and considerable style.",9,0,3,16 March 2015
World War Z," Zombie Mayhem at its Finest
","Rating: 4.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil KidA first-rate zombie film by all accounts. Brimming with palpable tension, replete with suspenseful moments, and pulsating with heart- pounding action. Fans of zombie movies or horror film in general will love this latest Hollywood rendition of sprinting, wall-climbing zombies. Traditionalists don't need to be put off by the this new, revamped version of zombie mobility and should instead, graciously welcome this innovative conceptualization of zombie action.The back-story is appropriately integrated into the proceedings and the each course of action is well justified from both, the director's as well as the viewers' perspectives. But make no mistake, the movie offers no spoon-fed helpings and you need to pay proper attention - even though you won't need to rack your brains - to attune yourself with the flow of this apocalyptic environment.One of the most delightful aspects of 'World War Z' is that it boasts of an abundance of memorable, nerve-wracking scenes - the hallmark of most great films - that will remain with you for days after leaving the cinema hall. Some of the scenes literally have to be seen to be believed (especially the entire scenario in Israel and the film's climax in the WHO building), and you'll be begging yourself to catch a second serving of this delectable film at the earliest. Fans of the novel won't be disappointed, as the author's vision (though certain aspects have been tweaked for creative and cinematic purposes) is maintained in essence and pertinent and crucial parts of the novel have been retained.Most impressive is director Marc Forster's (Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner) assured craftsmanship. With just a few credible projects on his resume and no proof of expertise in the horror or action genre (please don't even mention the appalling 'Quantum of Solace'), one could easily be forgiven to dismiss his merit as a director for a movie of this magnitude. But after watching the film, one would again be easily forgiven to plead with the studio not to change the director for the movie's sequel, and make no mistake, this is a sequel that will be eagerly anticipated when it's announced.Finally, Brad Pitt once again proves why he's regarded as a global cinema icon. He succinctly balances the complex task between being a moviestar you'll root for and an actor who you'll empathize and care for. Among a cast (excluding the zombies of course) that has virtually nothing to do - besides the intensely riveting Daniella Kertesz - he ably shoulders the film from the first scene to the last and prevents it from being relegated to just another mindless and fun zombie flick. 'World War Z' is yet another jewel in his already studded crown and shall go down as a genuine horror classic in years to come.",10,21,44,30 June 2013
The Hunger Games," One Of The Worst Book To Movie Adaptions Ever
","I've given it a 6/10 & that one extra star is only because of Jennifer Lawrence's performance, unfortunately for her its also her 1st bad film. I understand that a movie has to be different from the book, due to cinematic reasons, but not this much. Too predictable, lack of any tension, no character development, disjointed scenes, horrible acting from the rest of the cast (except Donald Sutherland - he's always good), repulsive cinematography and most of all, a failure to create any bond between the audience & the protagonists. Basically, it was exactly opposite of what the book was.One other thing that is increasingly appalling nowadays, is that most mediocre adaptations of books are doing great business at the box-office, or is just the hype good books bring that is responsible for this (and I do not consider the 'Twilight Franchise' as good literature). Whatever it is, the general audience should at least be prudent and skeptical enough before queuing up for the even more lackluster sequels to the subsequent books.We should comprehend that something is alarmingly wrong with the movie studios, when comic book characters are given superlative visual treatment (not that I'm complaining, I simply adore some superheroes & have grown up reading them), while great novels are dealt with mediocre standards with only well directed marketing and publicity gimmicks, to milk enough dough from the hype these novels generate.",4,8,16,1 April 2012
Zootopia," Zootopia Review: Immensely Enjoyable, Surprisingly Topical, Absolutely Unmissable
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.9/5 starsThe ingeniously conceived and brilliantly executed 'Zootopia' offers a subtly delivered, thought-provoking message that's as timely and topical as its gorgeous visual splendor is immersive and delightful. And, it does all this and more while being fast-paced, extremely witty, at times rib-tickling hilarious, and wholly exciting. It's the kind of matured entertainment that doesn't alienate adults but also ensures that it refrains from talking down to kids.The largest elephant to the smallest shrew and everything in between live in the city of Zootopia â a mammal metropolis, a melting hot- pot of cultures and races, where various animals live in harmony, at least on the face of things. Enter Judy Hopps, the first bunny to join the police force. Her dreams and zeal are quickly sent for a toss when she learns just how arduous a task it is to enforce the law. Not one to ever be deterred, Judy jumps at the chance of cracking a mysterious case that's left the entire force baffled. However, that also means teaming with Nick Wilde, a wily, fast- talking, con-fox who makes her job and life all the more harder.On the surface, this Disney venture is quite conventional on many levels, but as the layers begin to peel off, there's so much wit, flair, and subtle hints at societal woes that it outperforms many a deeply themed, adult-driven drama. This is dressed as nothing but a buddy-cop movie aimed at kids that slowly and unexpectedly metamorphoses into a political thriller, with underlying social and racial themes. A la, George Orwell's Animal Farm with a sweet, modern-day Disneyfied twist â 'Zootopia' almost plays like an LA film noir that delivers a feel-good message about being non- prejudiced to folks, who're different to us in race, and the need for tolerance in an increasingly fearful and diverse world.'Zootopia' just scores on so many home runs on so many fronts that it instantly finds itself right up there with the cremÃ¨-de-la-crÃ¨me of Disney classics like 'The Lion King', 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', 'Beauty and the Beast', and 'Aladdin'. So entertaining, so satisfying, so introspective.",10,4,9,10 July 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not since 'The Avengers' and 'TDKR' last year, have I had so much fun at the movies. And I see a lot of movies.
","Rating: 4.9/5 Reviewed by Dare Devil Kid (DDK)The Star Trek franchise is truly revitalized, alive, well, and kicking thanks to J.J. Abrams. Not just is it the best Trek film ever, but its also a sci-fi classic, right up there with the best in the genre. J.J. Abrams might not be the next Steven Spielberg....yet....but he surely has the potential to get there. Just look at his already sterling repertoire - 'MI: 3', the 'Star Trek' reboot, and now its sequel. I am now feeling a bit relieved about the 'Star Wars' sequels being hemmed by him.This movie checks a lot of boxes below that are required to classify a film of this magnitude as an instant classic:Great performances by the entire cast (especially Chris Pine, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Simon Pegg). - CheckThe quintessential amalgamation of CGI, action, plot, drama, suspense, thrill, and emotions in a sci-fi movie. - CheckGreat suspense, intrigue, and mystery in the plot to keep the audience guessing and hooked till the very end. - CheckA tight screenplay with good one-liners and some shocking twists that leave you more stunned than dazed - CheckAn awe-inspiring background score (but to be fair the score was already composed for the equally brilliant first film) - CheckEdge of the seat scenes and clap your hands moments - CheckStunning cinematography and production design - CheckMeticulously detailed makeup, costumes, and hair styling - CheckEqually enjoyable by avid, hardcore fans of the franchise and rookie viewers as well (read Trekkies and non-Trekkies) - CheckA sinking feeling when you know the journey through this great film is about to end and an absolutely overwhelming feeling exiting the theater - Check, Check, Check!Films like 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the reason why we buy movie tickets. As of 22nd May 2013, this is unquestionably the best film of the year and will be very hard to dislodge from the top spot.",10,4,13,21 May 2013
The Babadook," Starts Out Dull, Ends with a Bang
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.4/5 starsWhat starts of as a real slow burner with the impression of literally going nowhere, really picks up steam two thirds of its way into the narrative. In this aspect alone, debutante Director, Jennifer Kent, does a swell job with this Australian horror film that derives its chills from a fictitious pop-up book.The story deals with Amelia (Essie Davis), who's still at a loss six years after the violent death of her husband. She struggles to discipline her 'out of control' 6 year-old, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), a son she finds impossible to love. Samuel's dreams are plagued by a monster he believes is coming to kill them both. When a disturbing storybook called 'The Babadook' turns up at their house, Samuel is convinced that the Babadook is the creature he's been dreaming about. His hallucinations spiral out of control, he becomes more unpredictable and violent. Amelia, genuinely frightened by her son's behavior, is forced to medicate him. But when Amelia begins to see glimpses of a sinister presence all around her, it slowly dawns on her that the thing Samuel has been warning her about may be real.As much as it provides some genuine mystery and jolting scares, the movie also serves as an insight into depression and the depths of hell our personal demons can plunge us to. Though the screenplay takes longer than necessary to build and at times even appears dull, the Director manages to hold our interest till the ball really starts to roll, and then our wait is delightfully rewarded with some spine-chilling thrills and chills galore, without ever subjecting viewers to cheap, horror clichÃ©s. The performances from the two leads also hold the film together and they lend immense volume to the narrative turns over to the more intense portions.'The Babadook' is one of those films where you realize that the wait was really worth it once you enter the final third act. In fact, the last 20 minutes or so of the film showcases some of the best supernatural, bone-chilling elements assemble on screen. The twist at the end is also something you'll never see coming. If only the movie picked up sooner, or if Director, Kent, exercised as astute a control over the first half of the film as she displays in the second, 'The Babadook' would have easily found its way into the pantheon of horror classics. Nevertheless, it's more than a decent way to spend a night seeking a genuinely spooky tale shrouded in mystery and some spine-chilling thrills.",7,2,6,12 November 2014
The Danish Girl," The Acting is What Makes this Film
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.1/5 stars'The Danish Girl' explores a pertinent topic that's seldom told in mainstream cinema. Hopefully, with Oscar winners Tom Hooper and Eddie Redmayne attached to the subject this time, along with upcoming starlet Alicia Vikander, the subject of transsexuality will get, at the very least, a small short in the arm. The film revolves around the love story inspired by the lives of artists Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener. It follows the evolution of their work and marriage as they navigate Lili's groundbreaking journey as a pioneering transsexual.Though the film hinges firmly on Redmayne's transformative and heartfelt performance, it's helped considerably by Vikander's strong portrayal of his understanding, cognitive wife Gerda â torn between the desire to keep her husband and the support she lends to help him take an unprecedented, life-changing, step â and a lovely turn by Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts as Redmayne's old friend. If Redmayne is totally convincing as both Einar and the film's eponymous character â providing another sterling example of how deeply he can immerse himself in a role â then, Vikander delves deep beneath the surface to explore a truly fascinating woman.Still, you wish that the film had dwelled into the strange relationship that developed between Gerda and Lili's transsexuality (Einar's alter-ego after embracing his true gender) as they endeavored to comprehend it together. Instead, Hooper and his writer Coxon choose to stay on a safe path and dwell mostly into sentimental territory, which detracts somewhat from the film's topical nature pertaining to history's first recorded transsexual. Nevertheless, 'The Danish Girl's' unique and brave story, and the two delicate central performances give it a gripping emotional weight that is quite affecting.",7,0,1,24 February 2016
Creed," True Championship Material
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.5/5 stars'Creed' brings the 'Rocky' franchise off the mat for a surprisingly effective seventh round that extends the boxer's saga in interesting new directions while staying true to its classic predecessors' roots. After 'Rocky' and its immediate sequel, this is the best film of the series, and worthy of the championship belt. Director Ryan Coogler ('Fruitvale Station') infuses his film with a genuine passion and un-ironic attachment to the original's best qualities, particularly its delicate balancing act between anguish and triumph.The surest sign that Coogler has honored his source material is that 'Creed' is populist cinema through and through. His achievement is that he gives his audience exactly what they want and makes it feel like a gift rather than a bribe. But Coogler manages to soar beyond simply making an entertaining boxing movie by infusing 'Creed' with a chief detail that makes it so good: perspective. The smartest thing Sylvester Stallone did was to not write and/or direct this film. Ryan Coogler brings a fresh set of eyes to the project. 'Creed' works both as part of a larger franchise and on its own massively entertaining terms - it's a loving look to the past and a confident glance towards the future, and most importantly, a triumphant return to form for the 'Rocky' franchise that kept losing its way further and further since the third entry.Sylvester Stallone gives a spectacular performance in the film as he returns to his iconic role of Rocky Balboa. Stallone acts as both a mentor and hero to Adonis, delivering a heartwrenching and emotional performance that's should certainly snag him an Academy Award nomination, and had it not been for Idris Elba's bone-chilling, spellbinding act in this year's 'Beasts of No Nation', he might have won the damn thing, too. Still, after all these years, Stallone has finally turned to a dramatic role rather than adding another action hero credit to his sterling repertoire, and pulls it off with stunning aplomb that would leave even his most ardent fans gobsmacked. Jordan is perfect in the boxing scenes, and plays off Stallone admirably in the dramatic and emotional ones; their chemistry and relationship is the film's high point, even more than the triumph and tenacity of the pugilist's character.'Creed' rises above its well-worn premise and delivers a film that's at once stylish, engaging, and ultimately moving. The gritty direction, sensational performances from Jordan and Stallone, and surprising depth packs a combination of punches that make the film both brilliant and entertaining.",9,1,4,19 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," One Of The Few Genuinely Good Superhero Movies Which Aptly Translates The Comic Book!!
","I was fortunate to catch a special screening of 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' a few days ago and I must admit that, it way exceeded my expectations. So much so, that I was stimulated into writing this review, something that I don't often practise.First let me clarify that this isn't one of your run of the mill, blown-up SFX in your face, unrealistic action-oriented, plot less superhero movies that's thrashed out nowadays('Spiderman 2&3', 'Hulks', 'Fantastic Four 1&2', the intolerably over-hyped 'Ironman', and more...). It might be no 'Dark Knight' or 'Batman', but its definitely worth your movie ticket.The movie begins just like the 'Wolverine Origins: Super Special' comic book - which I'm might proud to have in my possession - and Wolverine being one of my favourite superheroes since my teenage years, the initial sequences itself gladdened me immensely. From hereon, the movie just keeps escalating.The script is spot-on, the narration flows smoothly, 'Gavin Hood's' direction without being brilliant, is noteworthy, and the action is mind-blowing with a rustic feel. The SFX might not be the best in recent years(which might be a blessing in disguise, considering some of the inane SFX extravaganzas released in recent years), though certain FX, animation and compositing amalgamations are still astounding. Fact in the matter being the climax, which rivets you to the edge of your seat and lingers in your mind for a considerable period.As far as the acting goes, most of the cast turn in decent performances, especially 'Leiv Schrieber' as Sabertooth is exceptional, but its undoubtedly 'Hugh Jackman' who steals the show. This guy was just born to play Wolverine, its like he emerges from the comic book pages on to the big screen. Add to this, his superlative physique and fleeting nudity, and there's eye candy for the ladies too.The X-men franchise without being the best around(Star Wars, Indiana Jones), has always strived for entertainment and sensibility simultaneously. This movie is no exception, with it being on par with the first of the series.A great summer blockbuster after a long time.My Rating: 8/10..........Go for it guys!!!",8,51,113,19 April 2009
Spotlight," GreatÂJust GreatÂNo Two Words about it
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 stars'Spotlight' is an exemplary film that shows us the staggering amount of hypocrisy, religious pandering, and face-saving that goes on in the world, from the bedrock of our society right to its highest echelons. More than just an account of ghastly occurrences, 'Spotlight' is a mind-numbing, blood-boiling portrait of the pain and suffering experienced by scores of innocent kids around the world at the hands of the pseudo-moral custodians of society. The film tells the riveting true story of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigative team that shook the city to its core and created a crisis in one of the world's oldest and most-trusted institutions.When the Boston Globe's unyielding 'Spotlight' team of journalists probes accusations of pedophilia against the Catholic Church, their year-long investigation unveils a decades-long subterfuge at the highest levels of Boston's religious, legal, and government establishments, all to preserve a hypocritical, almost criminal pious faÃ§ade, eventually leading to a plethora of revelations around the world. The way the team go about doing their job compels us to genuinely admire journalists, who work tirelessly to unveil the facts concealing grave issues plaguing modern society, even if those issues bring forth the wrath and clout of powerful, populist institutions like the Catholic Church. Another extremely pertinent thing it manages to achieve is in being a blueprint for journalistic ethics and impartiality, especially in times of subjective news reporting as these.Tom McCarthy's Direction and his screenplay â co-written with Josh Singer â shrewdly and effectively balances some much-needed wit along with the movie's harsh truths. But where 'Spotlight' hits a whole home run is in placing the audience alongside the reporters, enabling us to partake in their disbelief, repugnance, and frustration. The breathless, tense, highly intense performances from a top-notch, fully absorbed, and wholly dedicated all-star cast are almost tangible from the cushy upholstery of out theater seats. Each actor portrays an indefatigable fortitude (Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and Liev Schreiber â in that order â just do it a tad more than the others) to uncover the length and breadth of decadence unfolding on screen.'Spotlight' is an intricate web, but, when it's finally untangled, a remarkable and striking picture emerges.",10,1,2,6 March 2016
The Hateful Eight," Devilishly Good From Quintessentially Diabolical Tarantino
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.9/5 stars'The Hateful Eight' is a cinema buff's dream - outrageous, extraordinary, extreme filmmaking at its most confident, and unlike anything else in theaters this season. But that's only to be expected from Quentin Tarantino, one of the few directors with the clout to pursue his vision wherever it takes him. It's a big, shambling, audacious inversion of the western genre, held together by Tarantino's sincere conviction that beyond his unbridled imagination, American audiences might recognize their own fractious nation.Set about a decade after the Civil War, a stagecoach hurtles through the wintry Wyoming landscape. The passengers, bounty hunter John Ruth and his fugitive Daisy Domergue, race towards the town of Red Rock where Ruth, known in these parts as 'The Hangman,' will bring Domergue to justice. Along the road, they encounter two strangers: Major Marquis Warren, a black former union soldier turned infamous bounty hunter, and Chris Mannix, a southern renegade who claims to be the town's new Sheriff. Losing their lead on the blizzard, Ruth, Domergue, Warren and Mannix seek refuge at Minnie's Haberdashery, a stagecoach stopover on a mountain pass. When they arrive at Minnie's, they are greeted not by the proprietor but by four unfamiliar faces. Bob, who's taking care of Minnie's while she's visiting her mother, is holed up with Oswaldo Mobray, the hangman of Red Rock, cow-puncher Joe Gage (Madsen), and Confederate General Sanford Smithers. As the storm overtakes the mountainside stopover, our eight travelers come to learn they may not make it to Red Rock after all.You can feel Tarantino crushing on Howard Hawks and John Ford in every frame of this weirdly engaging epic. The characters are big. The horses are real. And the quiet promise of the American Dream is always palpable. Even at almost three hours, the story never feels labored. A lot of that is because Tarantino's dialogue is rapturous to the ear. But mostly it's because the performances are all so strong. Hell, matter of fact it feels far shorter than many of the 100-or-so- minute duds we've had to endure this year.Now that isn't saying that 'The Hateful Eight' is a western as wacky as 'Django Unchained', but it's everything you want from a Tarantino movie: unbearable tension, deft and intuitive dialogue interspersed with acerbic wit, fleshed-out characters, and sudden, grisly violence. This 8th outing from Tarantino offers another well-aimed round of his signature blend of action, humor, thrills, and over- the-top violence - all while demonstrating an even stronger grip on his filmmaking craft.",10,8,29,27 December 2015
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," A Very Good Biopic That Could Have Been Way Better
","Rating: 3.6/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil KidRaw, passionate, intense, emotional, and inspirational; 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is quite a competent retelling of Milkha Singh's journey, which just falls short of being a completely rousing epic. Director Rakesh Omprakash Mehra does a fine job of putting us right into the protagonist's shoes and he literally makes us feel the trials, tribulations, metamorphosis, and triumphs of our hero.Now, if the Director only had done away with some unnecessary songs, tightened up the narrative a bit, trimmed some loose ends, and focused a bit more on certain important sporting accomplishments of the sprinter's career; the film could have been so much more memorable. The tone of this sports-drama could have also done with a more stirring background score.Also, Farhan Akhtar's performance while dedicated and nuanced, is not that great like it is being made out. At times his accent does falter and his dialog delivery might make you forget occasionally that he's Milkha and not Farhan. The performances that really stand out in the movie are Yograj Singh's, Divya Dutta'a, Pavan Malhotra's, and surprisingly even Prakash Raj's (Director's please give this talented actor better roles).Alas, we have to make do with a film about one of India's greatest sporting icons, that almost delivers on its promise. Perhaps, the most significant feat of the movie is that we feel like running and celebrating along with Milkha Singh.",7,1,1,21 July 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Heart-Pounding Action Fare
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.5/5 starsIt really looks like Marvel Studios can do no wrong (let's just chuck the deplorable 'Iron Man 3' as an aberration). Their movies oscillate between just two categories - very good and amazing. The great news is that 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' fits easily into the latter category. Not only is this arguably the best Marvel film since 'The Avengers' film (Yes, I liked it even better than the first 'Thor' and 'Iron Man' movies - both mighty good films in their own right, which speaks volumes about how well this film's been assembled.), it's also one of the finest big-ticket, action-adventure movies in recent times.The plot deals with Steve Rogers (Cap) struggling to embrace his role in the modern world while battling a new threat: the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. He's also warned by Nick Fury that SHIELD has been infiltrated by its enemies. When Rogers acts on Fury's warning to trust no one at SHIELD, he is branded as a traitor by the organization. Now a fugitive, Captain America must get to the bottom of this deadly mystery with the help of Black Widow and a Falcon (making his first cinematic experience). However, the battle will be costly for the morals and ideas of freedom and liberty â core ideals SHIELD is founded on â with Rogers finding enemies where he least expects them. He also begins to suspect that the Winter Soldier bears a disturbingly familiar appearance to a ghost from his past.While the action scenes are top notch (but then again, that's expected from a Marvel movie), they also merge seamlessly with a well-scripted plot, which is brilliantly intertwined with some smartly conceived twists and turns. In fact, three quarters of the film plays out like a neat suspenseful thriller that keeps audiences at the edge of their seats with its unpredictability and mystery. However, there's no shortage of action, albeit whenever it's required. The action thankfully occurs to take the story forward and not just to fill up gaps in the narrative, something most Marvel films have displayed a flair for.As expected, the cinematography, production design, special effects, and CGI effects are of the highest quality. Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Redford, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, and Frank Grillo all complement each other effortlessly and are easy on the eye. The film opens up new and sumptuous horizons for the Avengers and SHIELD universe, and is sure to have a major impact in subsequent Marvel film ventures, especially those involving the honorable Captain America.'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is certain to go down as one of the finest superhero film as well as action-adventure movies of all time. And, it would be prudent not to leave the theater once the credits start rolling, as the usual mid-credits bonus feature - an added staple attraction from Marvel Studios - is surprisingly elongated and one of the most delectable ones yet, leaving the door open for some really exciting possibilities. Regular comic book fans will immediately identify these teasing prospects with vigor and a smile etched across their visage. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is a fine example of how to please hardcore comic book fans, standard action movie fans, and impartial moviegoers alike.",10,3,6,18 April 2014
Interstellar," Brainy, Ballsy, and Beautiful to Behold
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsChristopher Nolan has reached deep into the stars to tell a story about mankind's demise and refusal to go quietly into the night. Here is a director whose name has, quite literally, become synonymous with realism. The Nolanisation of cinema, which made the gloomy streets of Gotham a bridge between the fantastical and the commonplace, now grounds countless fancies within the mud of our reality. With 'Interstellar', Nolan inverts expectation once again, with a film rooted in the regularity of mathematics homework but spliced with the fantastic. The film charts a course in the latest theories in quantum physics and other space-related sciences to tell a story that engages and entertains viewers. It also goes to exacting lengths to meticulously depict the theory of relativity â vetted by executive producer and renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne.Opening, on a dusty model of the shuttle Atlantis, the film's near- future setting sees humanity starving and devoid of hope. Eking out an existence in a post-millennial Dust Bowl, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his two children lead a life of agrarian survivalism. But in Cooper we find a new man cut from old cloth - an all-American hero. Played with a drawling, Texan swagger underpinned by startling emotional depth, he is Nolan's most traditional lead to date, embodying the wide-eyed wonder of the Director's youth; a man for whom we are 'explorers and pioneers, not caretakers', who casts his lot among the stars as the human race's last, best hope.With the ailing Blue Planet left behind, Interstellar shifts smoothly into second gear. According to 'Interstellar's' on-board astrophysicist, Kip Thorne, the spherical wormhole (it's three- dimensional, obviously) and the spinning event horizon of the film's black hole (named Gargantua) are mathematically modeled and true to life. Sitting before a 100-foot screen, though, you won't give a toss about equations because Nolan's starscape is the most mesmerizing visual of the year. Gargantua is as captivating as it is terrible: an undulating maelstrom of darkness and light; this is space imagined with a dizzying immensity.Nolan grounds his epic tale through the relationship between humans. There is a scene in the movie that shifts from deep space back to Earth, from a father (McConaughey) who hasn't aged much physically to a daughter(Chastain) all grown up. The difference captured in this moment was everything Cooper feared about leaving his heartland farm, son and daughter, for a last-gasp mission to find an inhabitable planet for Earth's population.Thankfully, Nolan's helped no end by his lead, the charismatic McConaughey cementing his A-list comeback with a powerful performance that helps ground the grand proceedings and provides the film with its emotional core. Among all the space phenomena and alien terrains, it's his quieter moments that provides the film's small-scale highlights. It's also his back-and-forth banter with TARS â a former military droid with a fiercely caustic artificial intelligence (voiced by comedian Bill Irwin) â that lends the film some much needed humor amidst the solemnity of the mission at hand. Meanwhile, Nolan newbie, Chastain, and regular collaborator, Caine, provide solid Earthbound support with only fairly limited screen- time, and Hathaway adds a refreshingly down-to-earth presence to the outer-space adventure.For Nolan faithfuls, all his signature notes are also present: Michael Caine imparts wisdom in front of a blackboard, the story skips through time without a fade to black, Hans Zimmer provides a haunting score, and multiple action sequences are cut together in a frenetic crescendo. If there's one area that Nolan is visibly more comfortable with, it's tense, super-sized set pieces â and he more than delivers here. From a race against a giant, skyscraper-sized wave to some frosty fisticuffs atop a herculean glacier (meticulously shot to frame the combatants as tiny ants compared to the enormity of the icy mass they're traversing), 'Interstellar' contains its fair share of heart-in-mouth moments.The production design is more 'Alien' than 'Star Trek', with a grimy, functional spacecraft reaching murky, yet beautifully conceived new worlds. New cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytemer, more than ably replaces Nolan's regular DOP, Wally Pfister. The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of 'Interstellar' admirably and charmingly low-key. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes, while the film's tech â taking cues from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Alien' â has a tangible, old-school quality to it, from the embryonic, sous-vide-style hyper-sleep chambers to McConaughey's clunky, faceless robot sidekick TARS. Even in the depths of new galaxies, characters still write out their trajectories on white boards and explain scientific theories using pen and paper. Ditto the movie itself, shot on film in good old- fashioned 2D. It's to Nolan and his visual effects team's credit, though, that he's still able to push boundaries despite this traditional approach: 'Interstellar' contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive, and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen.'Interstellar' poses all the right questions and provides some highly cerebral answers to most of them, while leaving the others rightfully unanswered. This is Nolan at his highest-functioning but also his least accessible; a film that eschews conflict for exploration, action for meditation and reflection. For the first time, Nolan opens his heart as well as his mind. Never hitherto a comfortably emotional filmmaker, here he demonstrates a depth of feeling not present in his earlier work. 'Interstellar' is a wish to re-instill the wonder of the heavens in a generation for whom the only space is cyber. Anchored in the bottomless depths of paternal love, it's a story about feeling as much as thinking.As a light-year-spanning quest to save the human race, this is the director's broadest canvas by far, but also his most intimate. And against the alien backdrop of black holes, wormholes, and strange new worlds, 'Interstellar' stands as Nolan's most human film to date.",10,10,21,16 November 2014
Pacific Rim," What Transformers Should Have Been
","Rating: 4/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Not since 'Jurassic Park' have I had the utmost pleasure of witnessing such a great monster sci-fi mash-up. Like 'Jurassic Park', 'Them', 'The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms', and other classics of the genre, 'Pacific Rim' too intersperses the plot and back-story succinctly well as the action unfolds. The characters and their journey are given adequate footage as the monsters v/s robots action. More importantly, as the action unfolds, every single shot, each and every sequence is beautifully captured like a ballet reaching its crescendo.Unlike most gigantic FX laden pseudo sci-fi blockbusters like the 'Transformers' franchise and 'Iron Man 3', this films pays immense detail to certain laws of physics and plain simple logic. The action unfolds in a grand spectacle and straps you in for a roller-coaster ride. But it also pays respect to your senses and enables you to minutely follow each aspect of how the fight scenes are choreographed. Wish all gargantuan CGI driven films were like this.The film stays true to classic monster movies and also to its anime roots. Fans of both, anime and monster movies will be able to detect many subtle references to past classics and popular culture. In the end, 'Pacific Rim' is summer blockbuster entertainment at its best and you'll be craving for a second viewing once the experience soaks in.",9,19,30,25 July 2013
American Sniper," A Great War Film that Beautifully Merges Heart, Courage, Patriotism, Duty, Passion, Family, Reality, and the Horrors of War
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.3/5 starsPowered by Clint Eastwood's sure-handed direction and a gripping central performance from Bradley Cooper, 'American Sniper' delivers a tense, vivid tribute to its real-life subject. Director Clint Eastwood has crafted his best film in nearly a decade, as he fully captures the horrors of war and the brave men who put their lives on the line to defend our country. What's truly amazing about Eastwood's direction is that without resorting to any form of hagiography â something that could have easily crept and possibly been forgiven in a subject and theme like this â he triumphs with a measured, morally complex, and utterly gripping snapshot of what war can do to the men who fight it. Our old-horse auteur is less concerned with action heroism than the consequences of deadly action, and how it chips away at the fabric of the living. Still, whenever they transpire â and that's more than a few times â the action sequences are edge-of-your-seat stuff â Eastwood, a veteran exponent of action, especially gunfights, since his acting days, once again teams with his long-time collaborators to deliver some of the best-edited (in terms of both video and sound), masterfully handed combat scenes assembled in a war film.Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) was nothing more than a Texan man who wanted to become a cowboy, but in his thirties he found out that maybe his life needed something different, something where he could express his real talent, something that could help America in its fight against terrorism. So he joins the Navy SEALs to become a sniper, and ends up being heralded as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. But there was much more to this true American hero than his skill with a rifle. Soon after marrying his sweetheart Taya (Sienna Miller), Chris Kyle is sent to Iraq with only one mission: to protect his brothers-in-arms. His pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield, and as stories of his courageous exploits spread, he earns the nickname 'Legend'. However, his reputation also grows behind enemy lines, putting a price on his head,and making him a prime target of insurgents. Despite the danger, as well as the toll on his family at home, Chris serves through four harrowing tours of duty in Iraq, becoming emblematic of the SEAL creed to 'leave no man behind.' But upon returning home, Chris finds that it is the war he can't leave behind.Irrespective of whether you're American or not, any self-respecting national can feel for their soldiers through Cooper's evocative, nuanced performance, and Eastwood's assured hand while dealing with a topic of such sensitivity and complexity. We literally get to feel Kyle's detachment and disorientation, as Cooper â in his finest performance yet â fully embodies Kyle and the PSTD he deals with, and we quietly cheer as he gradually tries to overcome it in his own uniquely patriotic way â one where he finally manages to strike a balance between his family and the inherent, overwhelming desire to perpetually serve his country and fellow soldiers.Bradley Cooper is slowly but surely amassing an enviable, versatile filmography slate, garnished with star turnovers in wholesomely- entertaining blockbusters, and memorable performances in universally-loved and widely-applauded films of award-worthy stature. Three Oscar nominations in as many years, and a string of hits â from the first 'Hangover' movie (I thought the third one was quite good too, though the sophomore entry just passed muster) to the underrate thriller 'Limitless' to one of the most brilliantly constructed cinematic heists to his voice-over in one of the most exalted superhero films of all time to his most recent effort (even his serious dramas like 'Silver Linings Playbook' and this one make money) â are all the proof you need of his perennially rising status as one of Hollywood's most revered actors and box-office draws. Yet, Bradley Cooper isn't the first actor you'd consider for such a macho role, making the impact of this portrayal more remarkable. The word 'transformative' is tossed at Steve Carell's role in 'Foxcatcher', which is largely latex makeup. Cooper's is a more complete transformation, with convincing Texas swagger and twang, packing an extra 40 pounds of muscle, and plumbing new dramatic depths. His performance is precision personified â from the mannerisms to the accent to the gradations of Kyle's character, personality, and trauma. If this isn't exactly the man Chris Kyle was, it sure as hell is one indelible movie character.Eastwood reprises that Old West melancholy in 'American Sniper' with New West warfare in Iraq, extending the killing to enemy women and children, if necessary. Eastwood's sympathy for Chris Kyle (and his increasingly frightened and frustrated wife, brilliantly played by a career-best act from Sienna Miller) is palpable. Kyle is justifiably portrayed as a true American hero with an overriding almost desperate need to 'serve his country' over everything else in his life. At a famous concert in 1969, country music figurehead, Johnny Cash, called himself a 'dove with claws' when it came to his stance on The Vietnam War â basically claiming to be an anti-war proponent without giving over to all of the gushy, hugging, New Age palaver that's supposed to come with it. It's an evocative term that could also â on the evidence of his new film â be applied to director, Clint Eastwood. In this bold, in-your-face, true-life drama, he bristles unhesitatingly at the horrors of war, but is metaphorically in the trenches with its soldiers, passing them ammo and lighting their cigarettes.The tragic irony of Chris Kyle' death â shot by a disturbed, fellow soldier he was trying to help once back home â suits his legacy at a profound level; that death came from thin air, when least expected. It's a hell of a thing.",9,40,83,7 February 2015
Ant-Man," When it comes to Unbridled, Unabashed, Frothy, Light-Hearted Superhero Fun, Only 'The Avengers' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' Rival this
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.7/5 stars'Ant-Man' may boast the world's smallest superhero but the latest offering from the mighty Marvel studios is big on fun, ingenuity, action, humor, witty dialogues, and most of all, a tight, well- conceived, wholly involving script. Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd, and a formidable antagonist in Corey Stoll along with strong supporting acts by Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas, and Michael PeÃ±a, 'Ant-Man' offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale, yet seamlessly manages to firmly lodge itself right up there with the studio's best efforts.The next evolution of the Marvel Cinematic Universe brings a founding member of The Avengers to the big screen for the first time with Marvel Studios' 'Ant-Man'. Armed with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, master thief Scott Lang must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats. Against seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Pym and Lang must plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.When you get right down to it, there is something rather amusing about watching a protagonist the size of a fingernail doing ambitious stunt work while he attempts to survive dangerous obstacles; wherein lies 'Ant-Man's' best quality â it doesn't try to be a superhero movie yet it fluidly showcases all the craziness, charm, wit, and restricted mayhem associated with the best and infinitely more popular comic book characters. What's also surprising is just how hilarious the movie is in its entirety; even becoming a challenger to last year's spectacular 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' in terms of impressive comedic chops effortlessly intertwined within a blockbuster action bonanza.The primary reason why 'Ant-Man' packs such an entertaining punch is because it uses big-movie tricks sans big-movie hyperbole. It's fun, frothy, and light-hearted while also being an enthralling and memorable movie-watching experience, and convincingly carves a niche for itself as a worthy part of the Marvel canon. For once the bad buzz and subpar trailers were wrong. This hero deserves a movie of his own, and then a sequel or maybe two.",9,18,39,3 September 2015
American Hustle," A Triumph in Every Department
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.2/5 starsA movie that merits the word 'best' in multiple departments and facets, in order to do right by the sheer spellbinding effect it has on you. One of the best movies of the year and certainly among the most accomplished con movies yet. It boasts of one of the most enthralling original scripts written and some of the subtlest and sublimest intertwining of comic undertones witnessed on screen. The editing and cinematography are top-notch from first scene to last and copiously serve in elevating the aura of the film.Another factor that weighs heavily in 'American Hustle's' favor is its all-star cast that's right up there with the greatest star casts ever assembled on screen. What's even better is the fact that each and every member of this all-star cast are also brilliant performers in their own right. And just when you think you've seen it all, the movie unleashes one of the most unexpected twists and jolting climaxes seen in a con film. This is undoubtedly David O. Russell's best film hitherto. His thoroughbred masterpiece.Coming to the performances, Christian Bale delivers his best act since 'The Fighter'. It's also Bradley Cooper's best act that equals the heights he scaled with 'Silver Linings Playbook'. Plus, we are treated to another stellar performance from Amy Adams (why hasn't this fine actress won an Oscar yet beats me). Jeremy Renner holds his own in a slightly underwritten role and against his more seasoned costars. Jennifer Lawrence just keeps getting better with each passing film. We are fortunate to witness her best performance ever and that's saying a lot as she manages to even outshine her grand turnovers in 'Winter's Bone' and 'Silver Linings Playbook'. Finally, there's a nice, little tidbit for us midway through the film, in the form of one of the most marvelous cameos showcased on screen, enacted by Robert De Niro and played out as a tribute to the legendary actor's venerable career.",9,0,4,16 January 2014
Nightcrawler," If it Bleeds, it Leads
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 stars'Nightcrawler' is a great film on Los Angeles, a great film on the media, a great semi-noir, and a darn good thriller, powered by a supremely creepy performance from Jake Gyllenhaal in what is perhaps the best work of his eclectic career. But fundamentally, it's also a film about the power of showmanship, and the danger of believing your own hype.Ambition is supposed to be a good thing, especially in this country. Pulling yourself up from your bootstraps, building something out of nothing, making a name for yourself â it's all part of the American dream. In the assured hands of Dan Gilroy, a longtime screenwriter ('The Fall,' 'The Bourne Legacy') making his directing debut, that dream becomes a chilling nightmare. (Gilroy's brother, Tony, the director of 'Michael Clayton' and 'The Bourne Legacy', serves as producer here while Dan's twin, John Gilroy, is the editor.)Gyllenhaal's character, Lou Bloom, enjoys great financial success and dominance at the top of his chosen field, working as a freelance videographer who sells exclusive (and usually graphic) footage to an L.A. television station. Crashes and crime scenes are his bread and butter. He is driven. He is innovative. He is happy. He is also a monster â a fiend who preys on people at their weakest and worst moments. What's fascinating about Gilroy's approach to the character is that he doesn't judge him. He lets Lou do his thing and lets us gawk at the awesome lengths to which he'll go without an ounce of remorse or shame. You've got to hand it to Lou: He's really good at his job. Veering wildly between satire, psychological thrills, and moral drama, 'Nightcrawler' attacks the seediness of contemporary TV journalism like network on steroids. Filmmaker Gilroy, makes every cinematic second count. If you blink you miss a tell-tale reaction shot, a vital visual plot clue, or a brilliant cut-in. For a first- time director, Gilroy demonstrates an uncommon assurance, not only in his audacious tonal shifts but in the stellar work he elicits from his cast and crew.The most attention-grabbing contribution comes from Jake Gyllenhaal. Now 33 years old, Gyllenhaal is the same age that De Niro was in Taxi Driver and, like him, he is learning to channel an eerie, inner charisma, offering it up in glimpses and glimmers rather than all at once. If one were to somehow merge the Scorsese-directed Robert De Niro characters Travis Bickle (of 'Taxi Driver') and Rupert Pupkin (of 'The King of Comedy'), the result, I imagine, would be someone very much like Lou Bloom. From Bickle, he would inherit the nocturnal restlessness and vehicular inclination; from Pupkin, the delusional self-regard and entrepreneurial ambition; and from both, the sense that behind those eyes, some strange, and perhaps dangerous, thoughts are beginning to percolate. Never one to shy away from the darkness of a character's soul, Gyllenhaal, is absolutely in his element. He anchors 'Nightcrawler' with a gonzo, transformative performance. Long since, it has just been Christian Bale, who's been regarded as the dastardly endearing baddie, and true successor of De Niro and Nicholson-esque roles. Well, now, he finally has worthy company.You have to begin with the eyes. They've always been Gyllenhaal's most distinctive feature, but in 'Nightcrawler' they're like parabolic antennae, wide and unblinking, attuned to any signal, however faint. As Bloom perfects his trade, he also perfects the art of improvisation, moving from observer to director of his grisly tableaux. Would the shot look better if the accident victim were repositioned more cleanly in the headlights' glare? If the murderous home invaders are not caught tonight, perhaps they can supply some additional footage tomorrow? Gyllenhaal also lost between 20 and 30 pounds for the movieâanother echo of Bale and young De Niroâin an effort to physically substantiate the animal that he and director Gilroy say inspired Bloom's character: the coyote, feral native of LA, creeping down from the hills after dark. The effect is most visible in his face, in the sunken pools of his eye sockets and the rigidity of his jawline when he grins. Everything about him says 'hungry'. Gilroy's script is less interested in social commentary than in crafting a slippery character study, and Gyllenhaal is perfectly suited to that. Creepy, nasty, and at times darkly hilarious, 'Nightcrawler' shows Gyllenhaal exactly where he seems to want to be, and having the time of his life while he's at it.Although far from subtle, the metaphor of man as corporation in 'Nightcrawler' is skillfully hidden behind black comedy, intense scenes, tense suspense, and artful cinematography. It's a slinky black cat of a movie, commanding attention and reeling you in to follow down filthy, dangerous alleys. As much a character study as its a thriller, the film will get under your skin with its profile of a go-getter whose ambition and amorality know no bounds. 'Nightcrawler' is a modern- noir portrait of the way we eat our news, but amid the media, it slowly turns its unblinking eye on something darker, and much closer to home. It presents a creepy world of urban blight with rawness as mesmerizing as it's threatening.Dark, funny, unsettling, restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, 'Nightcrawler' offers dark, thought-provoking thrills. It's indisputably one of the best thrillers ever made and offers a devil of a performance from its lead star.",10,3,5,18 January 2015
Bridge of Spies," As Gripping and Smart as Any Spy Thriller Made
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.8/5 starsWith 'Bridge of Spies', Steven Spielberg infuses new life in Hollywood's all-but-forgotten Cold War espionage thrillers from the 70s and 80s. He goes about creating an arresting, sometimes haunting milieu in the midst of a mission of wits and high-intensity at the height of the Cold War, where American attorney James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA to negotiate the release of a US spy-plane pilot - shot down and captured in Soviet territory - in exchange of a KGB spy, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US.Spielberg enters full-blown Stanley Kramer mode, and triumphantly delivers (like he has on numerous times in his distinguished career) a socially conscious tale of back-and-forth diplomacy and behind- closed-doors politics at home, at the office, and on the global stage. At the same time, he doesn't let up the tension for a moment in this richly-detailed narrative where the interactions between smart and unpredictable characters is the main focus of the Director and his writers (the maverick Coen Brothers; avant-garde filmmakers in their own right). And, eventually, it's these interactions that are the core foundation of 'Bridge of Spies', with its real strength lying in the bond developed between its two main characters - unwitting negotiator Donovan (Tom Hanks in fine form) and incarcerated Soviet spy Abel (Mark Rylance deservedly an Oscar nominee). The warm portrait of a highly unlikely friendship is perhaps the movie's greatest achievement, even more than its sublime Direction, crisp writing, lasting cinematography, and exemplary performances.Steven Spielberg and the Coen Brothers take on the Cold War and spy world with a visually stunning, tension-filled, and surprisingly feel-good thriller that slithers along with gripping intensity and tantalizing uncertainty.",10,1,4,12 February 2016
Divergent," A Riveting Dystopian Sci-Fi Yarn
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsThis is one of those rare occasions that a movie based on a recent young-adult novel has been done right, so savor it for what it's worth. And, worth it is, quite a lot, going by the terrific 2 hour 10 minutes ride you get through the stark dystopian landscape of 'Divergent'. What's more, the movie is not just about bleak dystopian locations and the direct bearing they have on the daily lives of their characters, but it also shrewdly manages to raise some highly pertinent questions about our own existence and what sort of world we could be leaving for the coming generations. The most uplifting fact about 'Divergent' is that it pulls off this unexpected act through astute direction and some incredibly nuanced performances we usually don't associate with summer blockbusters.While, Kate Winslet is an old warhorse and has played practically every type of role with grace and confidence, Shailene Woodley is a revelation, and proves yet again why her name is being taken in the same breath these days with Jennifer Lawrence as one of Hollywood's brightest, upcoming female talents. She captures the desperation, confusion, grit, determination, vulnerability, and tenacity of her character with the kind of self-assured conviction and realism you'd associate with seasoned performers. Kate Winslet as usual just shows up and reminds us of her immense abilities in every frame she's in, playing the villain with menace and an uncompromising faith in her misguided beliefs. Ashley Judd lend great support in the few scenes she's in. Sadly, the rest of the cast offers nothing worth penning down.Now we all are well aware that this film is based on the first of a series of best selling fiction novels by author Veronica Roth, but as alluded to earlier, it's an aberration that the core elements of a good novel are retained while making it viable for a cinematic audience within cinematic time-constraints. For this reason alone, due credit must be bestowed upon screen-writers Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor for brilliantly adapting a recently loved novel, fresh in readers' memory, and transforming into a crisp screenplay that the Director and producers could work with. But, a screenplay - adapted or original - no matter how good, needs proper guidance, and this is provided with assured measure through the watchful eyes of Director, Neil Burger (known for accomplished efforts such as 'The Illusionist' (2006), 'The Lucky Ones' (2008), and 'Limitless' (2011)). Alwin H. KÃ¼chler's cinematography could have been engaging and Richard Francis-Bruce and Nancy Richardson's editing could have been crisper, but thankfully they do not steer too far away from the plot.'Divergent' not only gives us a fantastically entertaining blockbuster to thrill and chill us for w hours plus, it also offers up a thought- provoking sci-fi tale, which begs us to reflect on some startling points it raises even while we're being enthralled by the proceeding on-screen - something of an oddity in modern cinema. Along with being faithful to Roth's book, it also builds a strong cinematic universe apt for the screen and successfully manages to engage both sections of viewers - those who've enjoyed Roth's novel and even those who have no prior knowledge of the happenings of her dystopian fiction series. 'Divergent' is basically a must-see for all who enjoy a thoroughly gripping, judicious sci-fi tale.",9,13,19,29 July 2014
The Lego Movie," Unbridled Fun Interlaced with Dollops of Subtle Metaphors
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsAs a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who made 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs', have delivered another essay in controlled madness, bombarding you with far more candy-colored detail than you can processâthough, by some miracle, not too much to stomach. In short, pop culture eats itself. Everything you see, until the closing scenes, is Lego: people, landscapes, and products. Even fiery bolts of laser beam are orange plastic rods. You could try to resist or lament this marketing frenzy, but the movie is way, way ahead of you, landing joke after joke about the shiny pretensions of the Lego world.The story follows Emmet (Chris Pratt) an ordinary, rules- following, perfectly average Lego miniature figure who is mistakenly identified as the most extraordinary person and the key to saving the world. He is drafted into a fellowship of strangers on an epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, a journey for which Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously under-prepared. A construction worker by profession, Emmett is blissfully ignorant and content - like most of the Lego world - with the corporate and authoritative powers that monitor and dictate every aspect of his life and who have convinced him that this is his idyllic lifestyle. One day he stumbles on a magic brick that will reveal some higher truth, though the film takes ruthless comic pains to knock down the pomposity, derivation, and heavy-handedness that usually plagues such fantastical narratives.Without question, the film will unabashedly entertain you from start to finish. Kids all over will love it, but like all really smart animated films, it promises a great time as well for the adults. Along with delving into deep nostalgia territory and bringing back the world of Lego building blocks in all their glory, adults will also instantly recognize the wickedly funny and well-aimed sassy darts shot at corporate branding. If you care to scratch the surface a bit, 'The Lego Movie' also reveals copious amounts of metaphors - coated in hilariously humorous moments and dialogues - which take potshots at how corporate bigwigs are all but controlling every aspect of our monotonous existence and how we wittingly succumb to the manipulation of these powers when all we need to do is remain steadfast and resolve to live our lives on our own terms. The movie's irresistible theme song, 'Everything is Awesome', is a delightful dig and corporate branding, capitalist manipulation, and draconian bureaucracy, which in all likelihood will go down as one of the greatest cinematic metaphors of all time. Satirical subversion in family entertainment is an unexpected treat, especially in a movie that also functions as a triumph of product placement.The movie is designed with so much energy it sometimes spins out of control. But the fun is nonstop. The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the story is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it's hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession â constantly tweaking many popular culture icons. Major credit for this sublime achievement goes to Directors and co- writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the dynamic duo who earlier brought us 'Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs' â another terrific animated romp. As mentioned earlier, 'The Lego Movie' is a visual spectacle and the most amazing thing is how everything looks as though it's constructed out of Legos. That goes for raging fire and even the wild waves of a turbulent sea rolling under a pirate ship under full sail. The enormous team of animators and designers who first built this make-believe world out of more than 15 million Legos, before translating it all into a gorgeous, computer-generated adventure also merit the same amount of lavish praise in successfully assembling this instantaneous animated classic. If there's one minor contention with the film, it would probably boil down to it being a bit too fast-paced at times. Slowing down the tempo in certain scenes (a la Hayao Miyazaki) would have elevated it several notches higher; plausibly even give it a perfect 5 rating.Top-notch voice talent is key to any successful animated film, and 'The Lego Movie' does not disappoint. Chris Pratt is perfectly enthusiastic and naive as the reluctant hero Emmet; Elizabeth Banks throws out edgy wit voicing the action heroine Wyldstyle; Will Arnett is great as the growling, self-obsessed Batman, and Will Ferrell is on target as President Business, the order-obsessed leader of this world of Lego. On top of all that, add in the characteristic dulcet pitch of Morgan Freeman as the aged sage, Vitruvius, and and the sonorous tone of Liam Neeson as the president's hilarious Bad Cop/Good Cop sidekick, and you've got quite the crew of great acting voices.'The Lego Movie' is a terrific, fun-packed, well-crafted, thoughtful, and outstanding piece of animated cinematic magic. Just like its theme song goes, this film is truly 'awesome'.",9,0,1,12 June 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Of Powerful Performance, Of Stirring Emotions, Of Just Causes, Of Sensitive Messages
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.2/5 starsJuly, 1985. While taking bets on a fellow bull rider at the rodeo Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) glances at the day's newspaper. The headline notes that actor Rock Hudson has admitted to having the AIDS virus. Muttering some profanities, Woodroof goes on about his business. Sadly, he'll soon learn that AIDS is also his business.Featuring two bravura performances, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is a hard hitting drama that looks at the world in the early days of the AIDS epidemic. An accident at work causes Ron to go to the hospital, where his blood is tested. When Ron learns that he is HIV positive he goes into denial, claiming to anyone that will listen that he's not gay. The news worsens when his diagnosis shows that his illness had escalated into full-blown AIDS and he is given a mere 30 days to live. With time running out, Ron does some quick research and learns about the experimental drug AZT. When the hospital refuses to grant him access to AZT, which was still in trials at that point, he reacts angrily. 'Screw the FDA,' he says, 'I'm going to be DOA!' He finds a contact at a local hospital that steals the drug for him in exchange for money but soon that avenue closes. Later, Ron learns that the drug is readily available in Mexico from an unlicensed MD - played perfectly by a nearly unrecognizable Griffin Dunne â who informs him that the highly toxic levels in AZT has nearly left him dead. With his own prescriptions of alternative medicines he nurses Ron back and gives him a fighting chance against AIDS. Realizing how effective the non-FDA-approved drugs are, Woodroof begins importing them for his own use, but also to 'give away' to those who need it â provided they can afford the hefty monthly fee necessary to belong to his 'club'. This is where the seeds for the 'Dallas Buyers Club' â an establishment that challenges the unfair and inconsiderate system â are sown. The great conflicts set up here are Woodroof's efforts to fool the Border Patrol, the FDA, the DEA, and the doctors who put regulations before the slim hopes of desperate, dying patients.Woodroof, who is initially presented as an entirely unlikable bigot, partners with Rayon (Jared Leto), a flamboyant transgender he meets at an early hospital stay. Rayon's task is to recruit club members, while Woodroof works to outsmart the FDA. A great touch â the way this friendship of convenience builds. McConaughey delivers the brazen, foul- mouthed laughs and Leto tugs at your heartstrings. Their relationship is the true heart of the film, just as McConaughey and Leto's performances are its strength. Each actor was called upon to become frighteningly emaciated in order to play these men who clung to life with pure tenacity.In the past couple of years Matthew McConaughey has transformed himself from the smiling guy with the Texas-twang in countless romantic comedies to an actor to be reckoned with. Dropping almost 40 pounds of weight for the role, his sunken eyed character bears no resemblance to the smiling, handsome star many fans are familiar with. In fact, if you didn't know that McConaughey was playing Ron Woodroof, you might be hard pressed to identify him in the film. But it's not just the physical changes that make this performance so good. A definite homophobe, Ron soon finds himself the subject of jokes and innuendos by his former friends when his condition is learned. Ron learns the new rules life is teaching him. McConaughey portrays the real-life Woodroof on screen as a complex combination of sharp edges and unbridled gusto. He has an improbable vitality that emerges from some unfathomable wellspring of strength. The man should have been dead, but instead outlived his 30-day sentence by seven years. Enough time to build a mini-empire and become a soldier against a broken system.An utterly unrecognizable Jared Leto plays a cross-dressing gay AIDS patient who sees Woodroof's traveling/smuggling pharmacy as a lifeline, and ignores Ron's homophobia long enough for them to team up and steal an idea that's worked elsewhere. Leto is entirely transformed. His inflections, demeanor, movements, mannerisms, and expressions are all aligned in service of his radical transfiguration. That outer work pales in comparison with the stunning vulnerability of his performance, though.Dallas Buyers Club, which is notable for the actors' physical alterations, is ultimately about the transformation of a man from a homophobic wastrel into the leader of a grassroots campaign for survival â both his own, and those he once reviled. The based-on-true-events story follows McConaughey as Ron Woodroof - a gambling, womanizing, homophobic, self-proclaimed one-man rodeo drunkard who becomes an unlikely anti-establishment hero. He emerges as the leader of a fight to get non-FDA-approved drugs and supplements to AIDS patients during the volatile early days of the epidemic.Ron Woodroof's story has a universal appeal in that it examines the way in which our greatest challenges call upon us to be more than we could ever imagined to. In the film, Woodroof says, 'I've only got one life; I want it to mean something.' His illness assured that it did. When we are broken there is an opportunity for us to reform and allow our better selves to emerge. That's just what this rodeo-loving, whore-mongering, whiskey-drinking, son-of-a gun did; and in the movie version of his life, he does so in a highly entertaining way to behold.The films is a pro-active, uplifting and thoroughly entertaining jaunt through AIDS history, and the epic commitment of its actors to do right by it. 'Dallas Buyers Club' is not only one of the best movies of the year, it's easily one of the best movies of all time.",9,2,3,7 January 2014
Now You See Me," 'Now You See Me' Demands to be Seen and Savored for a Long Time.
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.7/5 starsUnabashedly entertaining, relentlessly engrossing, and delightfully mesmerizing. 'Now You See Me' is the kind of heist film that cockily displays the lighter side of entertainment in the crime genre with oodles of style and chutzpah. But the discerning viewer too gets his share of the pie with the ample twists and turns, which keep you riveted and guessing right till the end - a rare feat to accomplish in movies these days. Boasting of an all star cast, each actor brings forth a unique charm and persona to his/her role.The icing on the cake is the jolting twist at the grand finale, which knocks you spellbound and leaves you with a savory taste in its aftermath. You can't help but yearn for a sequel to this intricately wound tale at the earliest.",8,1,4,11 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Another Golden Entrant in the Sterling X-Men Legacy
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.2/5 starsIf there's been one film franchise that has stood the test of time and successfully maintained the superior echelons it set for itself among the plethora of superhero films out there, (barring an incongruously disappointing third installment) right from the time it debuted (I'm not taking the Wolverine spin-offs into account), then it's got to be the 'X-Men' chronology. In keeping with the rich vein of this adrenaline- pumping, prudently-executed franchise, Bryan Singer (back after directing the first two films that actually set the bar for all superhero films long before Marvel came and raised it a bit higher) weaves another richly-plotted, astutely-directed, high on testosterone film that pulls you into its adventurous journey and keeps you so engrossed that you'll end up wishing that the movies never gets over. Very few films have managed to achieve this in recent times, and the only other such spectacle that comes to mind from this year's lot is 'Captain America: Winter Soldier'.'X-Men: Days of Future Past' brings together the ultimate X-Men ensemble and pits them in a war for the survival of their species across two time periods. The beloved characters from the original 'X-Men' film trilogy battle a new breed of mechanical foes known as the 'sentinels', while their younger selves from the 'X-Men: First Class', race against time to thwart to change a major historical event and fight in an epic battle that could save our future. The X-Men send Wolverine to the past to meet up with Charles X. Xavier and Magneto's younger selves in a desperate effort to change history and prevent an event that results in doom for both humans and mutants.This could have ended up looking extremely shoddy in the hands of a lesser Director, but Bryan Singer brings all his expertise and dexterity to the fore, and ends up creating a masterpiece that's as high on its visual razzmatazz as it is on the sheer brilliance of deftly handling the intricacies of a complex storyline with multiple character arcs. As a viewer, you never end up being confounded at any point in the film and end up insatiably lapping up all the minute details of this time-bending plot. Along with Singer's assured direction, kudos must also be bestowed upon writers Simon Kinberg (screenplay), Jane Goldman, Simon Kinberg, and Matthew Vaughn's detailed story, which neatly brought all the intricacies together like a neat jigsaw puzzle, and also to Simon Kinberg for converting this story into a blockbuster screenplay. Newton Thomas Sigel's awe-inspiring cinematography and the astute editing by John Ottman and Michael Louis Hill are the icing and cherry on this scrumptious three-tier cake. Coming to the performances, all the main characters are by now well- versed with their roles and by the looks of it seemed to be having a blast in front of the camera. Understandably, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Ellen Page, and Shawn Ashmore have lesser screen time as the plot is mostly centered around the timeline in the past and how drastic measures need to be taken to change it and forever alter the calamity of the future. Nevertheless, whenever the erstwhile mentioned cast is on screen, they pull off their characters with the energy and approach demanded of them. The actual field is laid out for the cast from the previous film, 'X-Men: First Class', and the players including James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hoult more than live up to expectations. Indubitably, Hugh Jackman is the star of the show over here and he gets to play ball in both timelines in a role he can by now sleepwalk through, and as usual he bring all the chutzpah, bravado, and machismo, and unabashedness that has endeared us over the years to his portrayal of Wolverine. Evan Peters - as the fledgling, cocky Quicksilver - and Peter Dinklage - as the vile, bigoted, manipulative business magnate and misguided scientist, Dr. Bolivar Trask - are marvelous additions to the cast.With heart-pounding action, grandiose set pieces, dazzling visual effects, chuckle-inducing one-liners, endearing characters, and an intricate plot helmed by brilliant direction; 'X-Men: Days of Future Past is certainly one of the most lavishly assembled and thoroughly entertaining summer blockbusters in recent memory. This 'X-Men' franchise is well-alive and kicking vigorously, which almost makes us rub our palms in glee like a kid on Christmas Eve in anticipation of what the next installment shall bring to the table. Don't make us wait to long Mr. Singer and 20th Century Fox; bring it on as quick as possible.",9,0,1,12 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War Review: Very Exciting, Hardly Memorable
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 stars'Captain America: Civil War' ushers in the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with action and thrills galore, but it sacrifices a lot of the wit and does away with the strong adversaries that had made our favorite superheroes' battles all so exciting. Also, unlike 'Winter Soldier', Directors Anthony and Joe Russo aren't able to strike a perfect equilibrium between action, drama, humor, CGI, and characterization this time around. However, where 'Civil War' scores major points is in having the gumption to delve into thought- provoking themes.After another incident involving The Avengers results in collateral damage, political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability, headed by a governing body to oversee and direct the team. With many people beginning to fear the actions of superheroes, the government decides to push for the Anti-Hero Registration Act, a law that limits the actions of these extraordinary individuals. The new directive fractures The Avengers, resulting in two camps â one led by Steve Rogers and his desire for The Avengers to remain free to defend humanity without government interference, and the other by Tony Stark following his surprising decision to support government oversight and accountability. Eventually, things escalates into an all-out war between the superheroes while a new foe emerges from the shadows to take advantage of the volatile scenario.At a time when superhero films dominate the summer movie calendar almost every year, 'Civil War' aims to lodge itself in the upper echelons of the very best of this action-subgenre, but, somehow, manages to fall just short despite its best intentions and obvious efforts. The movie is very, very good, make no mistake about that, it's just not among the finest from the MCU (like their erstwhile sterling ventures such as 'The Avengers', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', and this one's own predecessors, 'Captain America' and 'Captain America: Winter Soldier'). You may love it while watching it, but it's more of a flirtatious kind of love that'll soon dissipate, unlike the profound connect one may have for the other aforementioned titles. Still, it succeeds in being another shining example of how Marvel transforms comic-book action figures into larger-than-life action heroes with real-life character traits and issues, which is one of the prime reasons that it has met with so much success while other superhero franchises have faded away.'Captain America: Civil War' is certainly an enjoyable action- adventure that'll appeal to everyone from fan-boys to adrenaline- junkies, to entertainment-seekers to those looking for a well- crafted movie. It just falls a tad short in terms of plotting and believable conflicts in drama, which provide a few obstacles along the way â especially in the final act. So while 'Civil War' may be an appealing movie, it does not end up being a memorable one.",6,1,9,22 May 2016
Inside Out," Good Concept, Underwhelming Execution
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 2.3/5 starsI really don't what all the fuss and universal praise for 'Inside Out' is about. It's a juvenile attempt at trying to portray elements as complex as human emotions and our state of mind in different situations.Sure, there were some good scenes and likable characters, and some plot elements do hit the mark, but, overall, Directors Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen, and their cowriters Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley tried tempering the whole gamut of human emotions, and end up ignoring or stifling the deeper aspects of our psyche and personalities. It would have been fine if they had stopped at portraying the lead protagonist, who was a little girl, in that light. But, when they also showed her parents to be reactive in the same manner, you do sense something fundamentally wrong with a film attempting to unravel our emotional psyche without having the gall to touch upon all our emotions. Even when it came to our protagonist, it would've made better sense to have showed more complex emotions lying dormant inside a young girl. For instance, what happened to love, hatred, affection, despair, passion, regret, relief, envy, contempt, courage, contentment and similar other feelings. Everything cannot be encapsulated and simplified under the five basic emotions displayed in the film: joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger.Perhaps, the filmmakers didn't want to delve so deep, this being a kid's film and all. But, they always targeted the film at both adults and children right from the promotional campaigns, and the film itself emanates that vibe of wanting to cut across age demographics. And, therein lies the inherent problem with 'Inside Out' - in trying to please all sections of the audience, it ends up being to heavy and cluttered for kids, and too immature and insouciant for adults. Even if I choose to ignore these obvious shortcomings, 'Inside Out' is still a weakly made film. The narrative gets unbelievably messy in the second half and most of the plot elements are all over the place. More surprising is how many of the attempts at humor - usually Pixar's forte - seem labored and flat. To put it bluntly, 'Inside Out' takes some good ideas and executes them with middling results and sans any conviction.",6,2,23,1 February 2016
The Fault in Our Stars," Way More than Just a Tearjerker - A Romantic Masterpiece
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 stars'The Fault in Our Stars' had amazing pre-release hype, and it lived up to its expectations by all counts. I haven't read John Green's immensely popular novel - and now that I've seen the film, I don't foresee myself reading it in the future - but if the movie has adhered closely to its source, I can see why Green's romantic yarn is so loved. The plot is centered around Hazel and Augustus, two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group.Speaking solely from the film's perspective, 'The Fault in Our Stars' is nothing short of a masterpiece that leaves you with a lump in your throat, teary-eyed, and an almost palpable aura of love engulfing our senses. The Direction is exceptional with a smoothly-flowing narrative that draws you completely in and keeps you emotionally engaged. The writing is of the highest quality with beautifully fleshed out characters that you genuinely care about and want to invest time in, and the dialogues are witty, satirical, and emotional without being mushy.Lending depth and gravitas to the seamless narrative and incredible writing are the cast of talented actors - irrespective of the length of their role, every actor does a fine job and their performances remain etched in our psyche long after the curtain comes down. Laura Dern as Hazel's (Shailene Woodley) mother and Nat Wolff as Gus' (Ansel Elgort) best mate stand out among the supporting cast, while Willem Dafoe is hauntingly terrific as usual in a bit role. Ansel Elgort is easy on the eye - though he comes across as effortless charming throughout most of the film, he ends up displaying his range towards the end and packs quite a meaty punch in the dramatic and emotional scenes.However, the sheer standout performance undoubtedly comes from Shailene Woodley, who's literally head and shoulder above the rest of the cast. Whether it is her acerbic wit, acceptance of her fate, emoting through her eyes, or delivering gut-wrenching moments through emotionally harrowing sequences and monologues, Wodley, quite simply, knocks every scene and dialogue of hers out of the park. This is an exceptionally young talent who's not only delivered an act worthy of an Oscar nomination, but it can be easily counted among the decade's best performance from an actress. Shailene Woodley is surely a superstar in the making.'The Fault in Our Stars' brings warmth to our hearts, makes us believe in the power of true love, and shows us that even in the most trying times, life can through us an unexpected, enchanting curve ball. It is definitely one of the most touching, emotionally haunting, realistic, and magical love stories ever, and will eventually go down as one of the best romantic movies of all time.",9,0,1,25 August 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A Great Franchise in the Making
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsExciting, emotionally resonant, and beautifully animated, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' builds on its predecessor's successes just the way a sequel should. The entire film is a romance - of visuals, of sprawling vistas, of the ecosystem, of parental sacrifice, of camaraderie, and mostly of the special bond one shares with a pet (don't the dragons, especially Toothless, bear a stark resemblance to our canine friends; not so much in their appearance but more in their mannerisms). It has a richness that's highly compelling; especially in the way it explores the complex relationship between man and beast. Moreover, it's got the emotional, humorous, exciting sweep you want from a summer movie. And hats off to Dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a wonderful sequel, filled with copious moments of fun and resonating sequences, which genuinely tug at your heart strings. To achieve this among the film's ample noise and movement is all the more praiseworthy.It's been five years since Hiccup and Toothless successfully united dragons and vikings on the island of Berk. While Astrid, Snotlout, and the rest of the gang are challenging each other to dragon races (the island's new favorite contact sport), the now inseparable pair journey through the skies, charting unmapped territories, and exploring new worlds. When one of their adventures leads to the discovery of a secret ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and their mysterious Dragon Rider, the two friends find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace. Now, Hiccup and Toothless must unite to stand up for what they believe while recognizing that only together do they have the power to change the future of both men and dragons.Although there are times when bits of the movie feel extraneous, the production as a whole comes across more like an organic extension of the original tale than something tacked on purely to score at the box office; something that can't be said for most sequels of well- received blockbusters. This is truly a rare sequel - animated or otherwise - that expands the story of its predecessor without rehashing it, and an even rarer family-oriented film that manages to be fun and mature without being condescending to its audience. And yet, the sequel doesn't attempt to take things in a completely new direction, choosing instead to expand its world and characters with great success.With multiple Oscar-nominated British cinematographer, Roger Deakins (Skyfall), advising, the film's visual work is beyond stunning. Another bright spot in the movie are its characters, they pile on the charm just like they did in the first film, and you end up actually looking forward to the third part. Credit for this must go to writer and Director, Dean DeBlois, along with the brilliant voiceovers - most noteworthy being those provided by Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Jonah Hill, Kit Harington, Kristen Wiig, Craig Ferguson, and Djimon Hounsou.Funny, big-hearted and - as you'd expect - a visual feast, this is a family film in every sense, and one to be lapped-up by both kids and grown-ups alike. It continues a very compelling mythology that I hope carries in to the third film. 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' isn't just a great sequel, a great animated spectacle, or a great example of successful franchise-expansion/world-building. 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is flat-out great film, period.",9,0,1,2 December 2014
Foxcatcher," Chilling, Perverse, Somber, Provoking
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.2/5 starsBennett Miller's new film, based on true events, is an extremely cold, creepy, and brilliant examination of the spookiest edges of the male psyche. It is methodical, deliberate, kind of heartbreaking, but mostly simply chilling. Channing Tatum, Mark Ruffalo, and Steve Carell deliver magnetic, career-topping performances in a compelling, quietly disturbing drama about sport, wealth, lost manhood, mommy issues, and murder.Tatum and Ruffalo play real-life US wrestling champions Mark and Dave Schultz, Olympic gold Medalists both, who are conscripted by gazillion-heir John du Pont to spearhead a training unit of wrestlers with the goal of achieving success at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Exactly why du Pont wants to do such a thing with his money and, essentially, his life; how he goes about it; and how the brothers respond to him and the claustrophobic atmosphere of his camp form the sinew of this mysterious and foreboding drama.And it is foreboding no doubt. The film is a little over two hours of menace, all cloudy skies, peculiar conversations, and chilly rooms and landscapes. du Pont is a creep and Miller and Carell don't soften him an inch. A soft-spoken man of gentle demeanor and few words, du Pont's enterprise at first seems to be fuelled by fierce patriotism. Such is the impression he wants to give. America has become beleaguered and self-hating, he believes. He wants to see it soar again, and putting together a wrestling team is one way he can do that.Mark is readily seduced and quickly begins enjoying both success in the sport, the pleasures of upper-crust socializing, and various other perks such as an endless supply of free cocaine. Dave proves a much harder nut to crack; du Pont is almost offended when Mark tells him his initial refusals are not a matter of money. Dave's eventual submission comes with a good deal of suspicion from du Pont, a man unused to being questioned, let alone defied or denied.Complicating matters to a level that would make Norman Bates blush, we slowly learn that underlying everything is the Vader-like presence of du Pont's mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Though now frail and ferried about in a wheelchair, she maintains an unhealthy command over her son's life and his self-regard as a man.Attention is being called towards Steve Carell's transformative performance as the creepy John du Pont, and he's also snagged an Academy Award nomination for 'Best Actor', which is totally fair enough. However, really, this film is built solidly on a remarkable three-piece ensemble, with Mark Ruffalo and to some extent Channing Tatum giving no less inspiring, and deeply skillful, performances. After many hints ('10 Years', 'Side Effects', 'Magic Mike') Tatum proves himself a serious dramatic actor while Ruffalo, as the older brother, brings a mesmerizingly edgy protectiveness to the fore. But this is, ultimately, Carell's film. Unrecognizable under brilliantly sculpted clumps of nose-enhancing face makeup, he simply sinks into the character of a man whose hope for his country is countered by his own self doubts.Director Bennett Miller showed with 'Capote' (2005) and 'Moneyball' (2011) his mastery over slow-burn drama, where stillness both commands your attention and makes you brace for a sudden change of pace. He deploys that skill set abundantly in 'Foxcatcher' to great effect, aided no end by the haunting cinematography of Australian Greig Fraser ('Last Ride', 'Zero Dark Thirty', 'The Gambler'). The movie is admirably restrained in keeping everyone's goals, if not obtuse, at least opaque; it's an extremely intelligent film that allows for great degrees of analysis, interpretation, and speculation. Miller's measured pacing and the film's overwhelmingly bleak tone are not geared to the YouTube generation; this is a thoughtful, adult film, and quite brilliant. Because of its deliberately slow pace it must be said that 'Foxcatcher' is not for everybody. Some might simply find it too slow and possibly, even, boring. Those who respond to it, however, will find themselves sucked into a world where pride, privilege, and a sizeable measure of perversion collide.",9,5,9,17 February 2015
Legend," Sensational Hardy in a Stylishly Entertaining Crime Drama
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.3/5 starsIdentical twin thugs Reggie and Ronnie Kray ruled London's criminal underworld in the 1960s, and depending upon who you ask, the brothers were either barking mad or quite charming. Or both. Despite their violent natures, the twins hung out with some of the most popular figures of their time, and became celebrities themselves; they owned clubs frequented by aristocrats and movie stars, and were even photographed at the height of their infamy by portraitist (and fellow east ender) David Bailey.That combination of grit and glitter in their story makes its way into 'Legend', a film about the Krays that stars Tom Hardy as both Reg and Ron. Since every Londoner has a Kray tale to tell, there have been a few quibbles about the story told in 'Legend', but nobody can dispute the sheer genius of Hardy's dual performance. Director Brian Helgeland finds his way into the story (which is loosely based on one of John Pearson's books) through Frances Shea (Emily Browning), Reggie Kray's wife. Frances narrates various parts of the proceedings, casting light on the brothers' criminal activities as well as on their relationship to one another.'Legend' depicts Reggie as a stable criminal mastermind while Ronnie â eventually diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic with borderline psychosis, and institutionalized at Broadmoor â is depicted as far more volatile and violent. Ron is openly gay in this version of the Kray's life story, although in real life, both brothers were thought to be bisexual and possibly incestuous. Complicated but simplified here, as are other details of their lives. And though the appropriate murders are shown and the guys are pursued by detective Nipper Reid (Christopher Eccleston) as in real life, but 'Legend' seems more interested in the Krays' domestic and emotional life, such as it was, than in their criminal undertakings. The movie delivers the brothers as established adult gangsters, illustrating their move up the crime ladder via business overtures from the American mob.For such a gritty story, 'Legend' turns out to be beautiful to look at, full of perfect and lustrous period detail and appealing music and costumes; all but the most violent crime moments have an odd, darkly comic element to them.It seems fair to say that 'Legend' doesn't set itself up to be the definitive Kray story, but it's hellishly entertaining. And it's not short of thrills either, the biggest of which is Hardy's performance as the twin gangsters. According to the Director, the technical tricks involved in presenting one actor as a set of twins haven't changed much since Hayley Mills starred in 'The Parent Trap' more than five decades ago. What's required to make it all fly are superb performances: Tom Hardy certainly scores on that front, and then some.",9,3,5,2 January 2016
Beasts of No Nation," Powerful, Necessary, Distressing, and Cannot be Recommended Under Good Conscience Even Though it's an Amazing Movie
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.9/5 stars'Beasts of No Nation' finds writer-director Cary Fukunaga working with a talented cast to offer a sobering, uncompromising, yet somehow hopeful picture of war's human cost. It's a heartbreaking drama that's hard, very depressing, touches on a controversial subject, but still manages to reward its audience. Yes, the film is a very hard watch, and there's some shocking brutality, but it's also extremely pertinent in today's times, exploring an eye-opening subject matter with clear thinking and respect for the complexities of the psychological damage done.In an unnamed West African nation, the life of young Agu (Abraham Attah) is disrupted when his father and brother are slaughtered in a civil war, and he's separated from his mother and infant sister. After barely escaping with his life from the regime's military, Agu is involuntarily inscripted as a child soldier into a militia faction led by the sadistic Commandant (Idris Elba).Fukunaga gives the film a visual grandeur that makes it feel like it's taking place after the world has ended, and all that's left for Agu, our unwitting protagonist, is this morass of endless, uncaring violence. The story, which is about just one of the 300,000 child solders currently exploited in combat worldwide, is given the necessary emotional heft and demands our undivided attention largely in part to the child actor and newcomer Abraham Attah who's an absolute wonder to behold. But if there's one actor on display who completely steals the show and chews up the scenery of every scene he's in, it's undoubtedly Idris Elba who metes out a high-powered and shockingly charismatic performance (given the circumstances) as the menacing militia warlord that has 'Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor' written all over it.'Beasts of No Nation' is one of the most harrowing, mind-numbing, and emotionally draining war movies I've seen Ã¢â¬â powerful and devastating to equal effect, showing us the horror humankind can commit through the eyes of a kid that's lost his innocence. Cary Fukunaga's direction and the performances by Idris Elba and the new kid, Abraham Attah, knock it out of the park. Perhaps, the most chilling thing about this child soldiers' eye view of Africa's endless civil wars is how unsurprising it all is amidst the savagery and emotions it engulfs us in.",10,3,5,5 December 2015
Gone Girl," A Suspenseful, Spine-Chilling Insight into a Twisted, Modern Marriage
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsSuspense, social commentary, a breakout performance from its leading lady, and a seriously twisted outlook - 'Gone Girl' is one killer movie. It's also a pitch-black satire of modern marriage, and one of the most unsettling films of the year: The premise is flat-out creepy. Make sure you're game for that before you see it.Directed by David Fincher and based upon the global bestseller by Gillian Flynn, 'Gone Girl' unearths the secrets at the heart of a modern marriage: On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) reports that his beautiful wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike), has gone missing. Under pressure from the police and growing media frenzy, Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. Soon his lies, deceits, and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question: Did Nick Dunne kill his wife? But there's more to this darkly twisted scenario than meets the eye.Fincher and Flynn (adapting the screenplay from her own eponymous book) have fun playing with both our expectations and our sympathies. As they peel away layers of their story, a feeling of dread grows; it's like pulling moldy leaves from an artichoke that is rotting from the inside out. With the close-knit psychological ambiance, the film paints American middle class as a blood-curdling, emotional danger zone. It's a testament to David Fincher's skill as a filmmaker that he makes something as complex as 'Gone Girl' feel so effortless yet riddled with palpable suspense and spellbinding twists.Couching its commentary in a propulsive pulp tale, 'Gone Girl' is a genre triumph - at once scary and deceptively sly. Dark, clever, twisted, and stylish, this riveting thriller plays to director David Fincher's sick strengths while bringing the best out of its female lead, Rosamund Pike.",8,5,8,26 January 2015
The Theory of Everything," Love, Spirit, and Acting at its Best
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsPart biopic, part love story; 'The Theory of Everything' rises on James Marsh's polished direction and the strength of its two leads. Not an idealistic, all flowers and cuddles ordeal - it's a veritable depiction of true love and companionship. Also, the debate between theists and atheists has been played out in all matter of social circles for years now, yet it's only now that a film tackles this subject in such a beautiful, heartbreaking, subtle, and enlightening manner.Starring Eddie Redmayne ('Les MisÃ©rables') and Felicity Jones ('The Amazing Spider-Man 2'), the film chronicles the extraordinary true story of one of the world's greatest living minds - the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking - who falls deeply in love with fellow Cambridge student Jane Wilde. Once a healthy, active young man, Hawking received an earth-shattering diagnosis at 21 years of age. With Jane fighting tirelessly by his side, Stephen embarks on his most ambitious scientific work: studying the very thing he now has precious little of - time. Together, they defy impossible odds, break new ground in medicine and science, and achieve new ground in medicine and science, and achieve more than they could ever have dreamed. The film is based on the memoir 'Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen', by Jane Hawking, and is directed by Academy Award winner James Marsh ('Man on Wire').Devoid of anything flashy, but backed by one of the year's finest performances, this intimate romantic drama is a revealing look at one of the most fascinating individuals of our generation. How Redmayne, not just able-bodied but downright pretty, twists himself into the famously blighted professor, and then projects the thought processes behind the disability, has to be seen to be believed. There's a mischievous quality to Redmayne that seems a good match with the wit Hawking has always managed to convey with a raised eyebrow and a mechanically-voiced quip. Stephen Hawking is the best thing that's ever happened to Redmayne's career, and 'The Theory of Everything' is a treat.'The Theory of Everything' reveals the man behind the icon: courageous, mischievous, funny, loving, but also difficult and at times selfish. It offers interesting characters and standout acting. Sometimes you wish the movie had delved deeper into its characters, but for what it is - a romance tale involving one of the great minds of humanity, interspersed with bits and pieces of Hawkin's academic prowess and scientific theories - it's engaging and moving. 'The Theory of Everything' is deftly funny on occasions, endearingly heartwarming at other times, and wholly inspiring. If only we could get more loves stories like this and 'The Fault in Our Stars', released earlier this year.",9,1,2,26 January 2015
Frozen," Disney's Most Hackneyed Attempt Ever
","Reviewed by: Dare devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 1.5/5 starsThe worst Disney movie of all time, barring none - period. A contrived, manipulative, and trite attempt at being cute, cuddly, and melodramatic. Even the songs (barring one; the superbly rendered 'Let it Go' number) - a hallmark of the Disney bastion - seem arbitrary, superfluous, and wantonly composed for lack of a better plot element.There was a time when Disney could seamlessly pull off the sweet and endearing musical routine without trying too hard. But off late, their recent offerings (excluding the terrific 'Wreck it Ralph') desperately seem to be making an effort to induce us into believing that their characters are all too warm, fuzzy and want to perpetually break out into a musical jig for want of a better option.Disney's last few efforts might have just passed enough muster to be seen, forgiven, and forgotten soon after. Frozen has however, lowered the bar several notches below those easily forgivable and forgettable Disney outings.",7,33,64,14 February 2014

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsHilarious scenes, rib-tickling dialogues, high-octane action, and crackling chemistry between Hill and Tatum. In short, it retains all the elements, which made its predecessor such a delight. While the first film came as a jolting surprise out of nowhere and surpassed all expectations, this one had to meet the lofty standards etched by the first 'Jump Street', and it does so with aplomb and an irresistible swagger throughout its proceedings.The plot, initially, may seem a rehash of the first movie, but as the narrative unfolds, it's clear that ace Director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller smartly recreate the magic of the first film through some carefully revamped scenes intertwined with hilariously new material, all the while upping the tempo to churn out that rare sequel that's even better than an already great original. '22 Jump Street' along with its predecessor will ultimately go down in the pantheon of action-comedy, buddy-cop films as a bonafide classic of the genre.",9,3,9,18 August 2014
Sultan," Sultan Review: Triumph, Tears, Glory, and Brilliant Entertainment
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.7/5 starsO re, Sultan! Those are the words along with the infectious background score that echoes at crucial junctures in the latest Salman Khan starrer, and that's the sentiment with which you walk out after the film is over. Sultan is the kind of film that goes easy on you at the start, you won't get your hopes up but you'll also enjoy the breezy entertainment that unfolds on screen, and then gradually, steadily, it keeps growing on you till you can't help but lap up every emotion, every dialogue, every punch, every kick, every cry of pain, and every shout of triumph with open arms.It's the dialogues, inspiringly emotional story, Salman Khan's inescapable on screen charm, and Anushka Sharma's knockout performance that are the real victors here. The narrative is something you'll guess from miles away, but it's the treatment and moving dialogues that completely bowl you over. Salman, who plays Sultan Ali Khan (for those still living on the moon), is a 30-year old, carefree guy, with no ambitions in life other than enjoying each day as it comes. During one such jovial incident, he bumps into Aarfa (Anushka Sharma) by accident, and falls head-over-heels in love. After a few innocent pranks to win her over, she starts warming up to him, and at this point you think you've seen it all before but the Salman's mischievous nature and Anushka's perfect Haryanvi diction and no-nonsense outlook to life is keeping you mildly engaged.Until one day, when she blatantly refuses his advances and insults him for his happy-go-lucky outlook, and you realize that Sultan has something deeper in store than a run-of-the-mill love story against a wrestling backdrop. When she tells Salman that she cannot love a man she can't respect, and his on screen dad explains him that the path to respect more often than not is through disrespect, you get ready to buckle in, and be swept up in a good story that's beginning to scratch the surface. Dialogues like these are peppered throughout the movie, lending it that meaningful punch that packs an even bigger impact than Sultan's in-ring punches.From here on, Sultan takes stock of his life, and his meteoric rise to the top, couple with training and fight scenes that deliver several knockout punches are a treat to the eyes. He gains respect, he gets the love of his life, he wins all that there is to win, and you thoroughly enjoy the roller-coaster ride through the first half, only to realize that Director and writer Ali Abbas Zafar (his best work by some distance) is not done tapping into your emotions just yet. Sultan's respect and honor, which he fought so hard to achieve, turns into arrogance, and this transition is shown with brilliant control and fluidity because of both the trajectory of the plot and Salman's magnetic appeal. If you thought that Bajrangi Bhaijaan was his best till date, then you've seen nothing yet. Given his meatiest role to date, Salman chews every frame he's in, and you can't help but be won over by his innocence and spirit. Where his accent and mannerisms falter, his energy and attitude with which he portrays the character keeps winning you over. The final scenes, where he fights back for his love, respect, and also humility, is something straight out of the handbook of how to captivate an audience. Salman makes sure that no one will walk out of the theater without a smile on their face.If Salman is attitude personified, then Anushka proves yet again why she's one of our most versatile actresses going around today. Forget her impeccable diction that never once leaves her character, it's her silence that speaks volumes. Scenes in which she breaks down or motivates Salman again leave you transfixed at her potential to steal the show even in front of superstars. And to Salman and the makers' credit, she's no mere prop in the film. Randeep Hooda and Amit Sadh are serviceable in their minor roles.A word for the music too. For once, the songs in a Salman film aren't used as breaks from the plot but take the plot forward. Even the baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai track is brilliantly integrated, and the title track will give you nothing short of goosebumps. The editing could have been crisper and there are quite a few scenes that demand suspension of your belief, like an MMA fighter eating regular food or a washed-up wrestler mastering MMA moves within six weeks, and then besting pro fighters. But, like we mentioned earlier, you can't help but flow along with the emotions of the film and ignore such logical loopholes along the way.Can a 40-year old local wrestler become an MMA champ? Probably not. But, then again, stranger things happen in sports, stranger than movie scripts too. Muhammad Ali when his third championship belt when no one gave him a whimper of a chance. And, while watching Sultan, you can't help but not bother about such trivialities. You'll laugh and cry and feel sad and exalt in joy at the character's journey. You won't be able to restrain yourself from clapping and cheering him on (After ages we witnessed an entire theater clapping at several points in the movie.). Sultan is a perfect commercial entertainer and a brilliantly packaged holiday treat. It's not just a movie, it's an Eid event that Salman has gifted his fans and neutral moviegoers alike.",8,3,4,24 July 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Franchise that Spider-Man Well and Truly Deserved
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsNobody understands the dynamics, material, relationships, and character traits of our fabled wall-crawler as well as Director, Marc Webb, and all subsequent cinematic versions of Spider-Man should be churned out by nobody else but Webb and his keen visionary skills. Like an astute artisan, he seamlessly weaves together a stupendous plot replete with equal amounts of action, drama, emotions, romance, and mystery, to dish out one of the most enthralling summer blockbusters that memory can serve. Lending huge gravitas to Webb's opulent vision are the brilliant performances from Garfield, Stone, Foxx, DeHaan, along with terrific editing ,cinematography, and some of the most amazing visual effect and CGI rendered on screen.If you thought that Webb's first cinematic rendition of Spidey was head and shoulder above Raimi's trilogy, then his latest film knocks all three of Raimi's mildly entertaining but poorly adapted movies right out of the park. Those who don't agree with this reboot of Spider-Man, need to view both the films against their predecessors and then perform a little research by way of the source material from the comics and the classic animated series, to see for themselves which versions stack up better against each other. Casual, impassive viewers who might feel that this would constitute as a waste time just for the sake of a film, would be quicker and more capable at differentiating between which is the better made franchise.",9,2,8,11 May 2014
Ex Machina," Intriguing and Beautiful but Somewhat Unfulfilled
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3/5 stars'Ex Machina' has an intriguing setup that's graced by three terrific performances, and it gets to harness the duplicity and suspense of humanoid robot stories, but it never explores its full potential, and ends up coming down to the very familiar binary question of every other humanoid robot story.Yes, it presents us with gorgeous special effects and some of the best-looking androids you'll ever see, but it also features the indie quality of a low-budget 3-person play whose dialogue isn't going to blow you away. Also, are we supposed to believe that a hyper-intelligent guy who loves alcohol and has created his own humanoids hasn't found a way to prevent hangovers?Still, for what it's worth, 'Ex Machina' showcases some stimulating ideas coupled with minimalist yet striking effects, and has an overall visually polished quality about it, making it more than an engaging sci-fi flick.",7,0,2,18 September 2015
Big Hero 6," The Robot, Baymax, is the Only Reason to Watch 'Big Hero 6'
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 2.5/5 starsGiven how advanced computer animation has developed and continues to develop, and considering that Walt Disney, the king of animation, now owns the film rights to nearly all of the Marvel Universe, it's a bit surprising that this is the first big-budget Marvel superhero animated film to be produced. Perhaps because it's something of an experiment, they chose to do it with a more obscure title like 'Big Hero 6'.The story is based only loosely on the comic book group. For instance, in the comic, Baymax (the lovable inflatable robot featured on all the posters and marketing material) is a synthetic bodyguard capable of metamorphosing into a dragon, created by 13 year old computer genius Hiro, using the brain engrams of his dead father. In the film, Hiro is still a teen prodigy, but Baymax is built by his older brother as a medical robot. Hiro, who graduated high-school early, decides to go to the same university as his older brother where he hopes to join the robotic department, which his brother and an eccentric group of students inhabit.A fire breaks out at a science exhibit for university hopefuls where Hiro is demonstrating his own invention called Microbots. His brother and a professor die in the fire. This kick starts the plot into motion when later a super-villain emerges using the same microbot technology, and Hiro gathers his fellow robotic students together to form a superhero team. The central mystery, which is merely identifying the villain, is the film's weakest aspect. It's pretty obvious who he is. As in a lot of mysteries, you simply have to look for the minor character played by (or voiced by in this case) a popular actor.A computer-animated mash-up of Japanese and American cultures (it takes place in San Fransokyo - a dream rendering of San Francisco and Tokyo), 'Big Hero 6' is a friendship tale and an action flick that winds up lost in translation. The story initially centers on Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter), a kid genius, and his relationship with Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit), a puffy bag of air who resembles an un-toned version of the Michelin Man. Baymax is a lovable, hugable inflatable robot â who doesn't want one of those? â and he belongs in a movie more lovable and hugable than 'Big Hero 6.'The world already has plenty of superheroes, of course, and 'Big Hero 6,' falters as a superhero movie. The relationship between Baymax and Hiro provides enough to play with, and 'Big Hero 6' didn't need to turn into a loud, cluttered action film, but that's where the story goes. Hiro teams up with the previously-mentioned group of brainiac students, and convinces them to use their amateur inventor skills to become superheroes themselves, so that they can take on an evil genius in a Kabuki mask who is threatening, naturally, to take over the world.In our pro-nerd, tech-heavy, superhero-obsessed culture, 'Big Hero 6' hits on all manner of popular themes. It favors brains over muscles and celebrates the power of friendship â good messages, all. But the big heroes who make up the '6' feel like bit players instead of full-fledged characters. Only the slacker-type Fred (voiced by T.J. Miller) stands out; the others aren't memorable enough to even be remembered once the credits start rolling, leave alone become popular enough to merit their own action figure molds. They're like the Avengers' not-very-interesting nieces and nephews.Directors Don Hall (co-director of 2011's 'Winnie the Pooh') and Chris Williams (co-director of 'Bolt') start strong, but 'Big Hero 6's' inconsistent script builds to an overly busy, standard action movie climax that detracts from the simple story about a boy and his cuddly robot pal. The action, too, is a letdown - even though the visuals are great, but that was expected from Disney - and the big battle and chase sequences call for some major suspensions of disbelief, even by animation movie standards. Also, since the tone is kept light, there's never much of a true sense of danger, adding to the film's many problems.'Big Hero 6' does make strides in terms of diversity and setting, and it's refreshing to see a movie for kids that acknowledges a world bigger than America. It may have more to do with worldwide box office potential than education, but it's a start.Kids will leave the theater wanting their own Baymax, and who can blame them? It's the rest of the 'Heroes' that don't measure up; the robot full of air is the most real thing in the movie. As with its live- action counterparts, this Marvel-based feature comes complete with a post-credits scene that sets up a sequel. It likewise includes an animated cameo by Stan Lee. So long as Baymax returns for that sequel; the rest of the team is given more depth; and the story doesn't trade coherence for unnecessary, messy action scenes, I'll still be game for it.",6,6,39,1 February 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Best Marvel Movie Since 'The Avengers', Bar None, and Easily Among the Most Loved Sci-Fi Bonanzas Ever, Period
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.9/5 starsGuardians of the Galaxy is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect - as well as funny, thrilling, full of heart, visually splendid, and packed with witty one-liners. Chris Pratt, overflowing with charisma, plays Peter Quill a.k.a 'Star Lord', the leader of the pack of endearing misfits, and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for 70s and 80s music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects. Zoe Saldana is smoking hot as Gamora, and brings a sense of visceral sensuality and deadly dynamism to her role. For the first time Dave Bautista is well-cast in a role that actually exploits his physical prowess along with his unexpectedly bang-on deadpan humor. Bradley Cooper renders one of the best voice-overs ever for a computer-generated, cinematic character, and his 'Rocket Racoon' along with the imposing, muscular, tree figure, 'Groot', literally steal more than a few scenes with their physical humor and witty dialogues.Director and co-writer James Gunn, brings a giddy, wondrous, endless sense of satisfaction to proceedings, which is possibly, dare I say it, reminiscent of the grand sci-fi space saga of your - the 'Star Wars' trilogy. Gunn appears to remember the high of certain kinds of movie-going experiences, where when the credits are over, all you want to do is get back in line and enjoy the whole damn thing again. The plot is bonkers, but to Gunn's immense credit, the core little group of disparate characters manage to latch themselves to you, and you're in for the whole ride. Gunn has helped take a relatively unknown property and made a film that will surely help blast these incredible characters to a level of fame that will spread across the galaxy.Guardians of the Galaxy' has wit, energy and zaniness to spare. It's overstuffed with effects and incidents, but it looks great, it feels fresh and is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. It will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more. If blockbusters are the cinematic equivalent of junk food, then 2014 has been a goddamn ice-cream sundae, and this movie in particular is the bright, sickly sweet cherry sitting on top. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' isn't just a fun- filled, adrenaline- pumping, visually dashing, humor-laden, ripping space sci-fi adventure; it's one of the best, most crowd-pleasing blockbusters in years.",10,1,6,14 September 2014
The Imitation Game," A Brilliant, Sensitive Character Study of a Brilliant, Ostracized Man
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsIn a nutshell, 'The Imitation Game' is a moving tribute to an extraordinary man. It both brings to life and pays tribute to Turing's history-altering and pioneering work that paved the way for modern computing, with nearly every moment infused with apt and appreciable importance.During the winter of 1952, British law enforcement officials entered the home of mathematician, cryptanalyst, and war hero Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) to investigate a reported burglary. They instead ended up arresting Turing himself on charges of 'gross indecency', an accusation that would lead to his devastating conviction for the criminal offense of homosexuality - little did officials know, they were actually incriminating the pioneer of modern-day computing. Famously leading a motley group of scholars, linguists, chess champions, and intelligence officers, Turing was credited with cracking the so-called unbreakable codes of Germany's World War II Enigma machine - a credit that was never came to light until years later because the government had decided to keep the operation covert even after the war was over. An intense and haunting portrayal of a brilliant, complicated man, 'The Imitation Game' follows a genius who under nail-biting pressure helped to shorten the war, and in turn, saved thousands of lives. If you don't know who mathematician Alan Turing was, then the film is a solid introduction to this complex individual whose discoveries were the foundation of the modern computer.What could have been a very dry and earnest film emerges, under the intelligent dexterity and watchfulness of Norwegian Director, Morten Tyldum - working from a screenplay by Graham Moore - as a engaging and rather extraordinary story. As gripping as its awe-inspiring, Tyldum's deft direction goes a long way in building tension as Turing as his bunch of eggheads bond in a common cause against the Nazis, while Moore's layered, pithy, and crisp script captures the highs and lows of Turing's truly remarkable life.The action here revolves around Turing tinkering with his machine, or simply thinking, which portrayed by an actor of Benedict Cumberbatch's caliber, is adventure of the highest order. He gives a performance that is, by turns, awkward, triumphant, heartbreaking, and, as a whole, superbly nuanced. Cumberbatch brings his immense talent and intelligence - and not too much glamor - to the socially awkward, notoriously disheveled Turing, imbuing the movie's protagonist with just the right amount of strangeness to make him endearing but not schmaltzy. Giving Cumberbatch fine company is Keira Knightley in the role of fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst - and vital cog in Turing's team, and at times even his source of inspiration - Joan Clarke. 'The Imitation Game' is no doubt a mighty impressive piece of work, but a large chunk of that credit goes to Cumberbatch and Knightley's superlative performances.'The Imitation Game' is a highly polished picture with beautiful acting. Beyond introducing the existential and technological ramifications of Turing's work, it tells an extraordinarily true story, and also reminds us how little we actually know (even those with the most power) about what goes on behind the scenes of international relations. The film is fascinating, uplifting, and sad all at the same time. With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, 'The Imitation Game' serves as an eminently well-made entry in the prestigious biopic- drama subgenre.",8,3,8,22 January 2015
Jurassic World," A Thrill-a-Minute, Kick-Ass Ride! To Sum it Up in Two Words - Pure Awesomeness!
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.7/5 starsWhile 'Jurassic World' might not match the original for sheer inventiveness and impact, it more than delivers as a supremely entertaining and visually dazzling sci-fi actioner with a surprisingly witty screenplay, top-notch cast, spellbinding special effects, and gripping, coherent action. Combining enough nostalgia, technical wizardry, and over-the-top thrills, 'Jurassic World' makes fans of the original feel like kids again (yes it's by far the best of the sequels - though I fell the 2nd and 3rd parts get undue hate - and almost on par with the 1993 classic), and is sure to pick up many ardent fans from the newer generation along the way.By illustrating just how far summer blockbusters have come in the past 40 years, the only way the young people of 'Jurassic World' can be entertained by a great white shark is by seeing one of them fed to the aquatic Mosasaurus, who splashes about in his performance pool and drenches park guests. Built upon the bones â literally â of John Hammond's (Richard Attenborough) original park on Isla Nublar, Jurassic World is a well-oiled tourist mecca. But the theme park has become so popular that the once-terrifying experience of encountering a living dinosaur has become as commonplace as staring at an elephant in a zoo. Children can ride a Triceratops and hug their favorite herbivores in the Gentle Giants Petting Zoo. Older guests can kayak down a river and get up close and personal with Stegosauruses on the Cretaceous Cruise. To combat visitor fatigue, geneticist Dr. Wu (BD Wong, reprising his 'Jurassic Park' role) has spent $26 million of corporate monies cooking up Indominus Rex, the park's first engineered hybrid. She's cobbled together from the DNA of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Carnotaurus, Majungasaurus, Rugops, Velociraptors, and Giganotosaurus, as well as some bits of cuttlefish and tree frogs. As Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), Jurassic World's no-nonsense operations manager, says, 'Consumers want bigger, louder, more teeth.'On the one hand, the film is exactly what you think it is â a lot of people being chased or menaced by ill-tempered dinosaurs that are trying to eat them. On the other hand, there's a level of wit here that you may not expect. The story is no great shakes, of course, since it exists only to put our main characters â and disposable extras â in harm's way. The reason behind this latest addition to the revamped dinosaur amusement park is, however, worth pondering â it's all because a jaded public demands something bigger and badder and scarier than your plain old dinosaurs. As a commentary on our collective Imax and 3D infused Next-Big-Thing blockbuster mentality, that's pretty on point. That the commentary is served up in a movie aimed at that very mindset makes it just that much more subversive. And it most certainly delivers on its promises. The ultimate bad-ass dinosaur â the Indominus Rex â is everything you could hope for in bad-assery, and the film's rather cavalier attitude toward human life ups our inability to predict who won't be standing by the ending credits.Given the park's previous tragedy, Jurassic World's showman of an owner, Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan, 'Life of Pi'), has Claire bring in animal-behavior expert Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to inspect the Indominus' paddock. Owen's been working in a research facility on the outskirts of Isla Nublar, clicker training Velociraptors under the watchful eye of a security contractor (Vincent D'Onofrio), who wants to weaponize the raptors and turn them into dino-soldiers. The uptight Claire and the laid-back, boardshorts-and-tequila-loving Owen barely have time to reminisce about their one disastrous date before the Indominus escapes, begins killing the park's security personnel out of instinct and the other dinosaurs for sport, and endangering the park's 20,000-odd visitors â including Claire's nephews, 11-year-old Gray (Ty Simpkins) and 16-year-old Zach (Nick Robinson) whose Gyrosphere ride encounter with the hybrid is a suspenseful centerpiece.Only one other scene tops that one for gash-and-giggle tension, an aerial assault on fleeing tourists by prehistoric creatures. Think of 'The Birds' directed by Fred Flintstone for a sense of Trevorrow's cheeky style. Trevorrow was handpicked by Steven Spielberg to direct, with only the brilliant sci-fi indie and 2012 Sundance hit 'Safety Not Guaranteed' to his credit. That he and Derek Connolly (who wrote 'Safety Not Guaranteed') collaborated again for the screenplay along with 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver was encouraging, and it shows in the final product. It's also a pleasant surprise to see just how well Trevorrow handles action. It's clear, clean, and coherent. Trevorrow hits all the right, respectful beats, as a protÃ©gÃ© should; you can sense a desire to please his mentor, with several amusing references to Spielberg's 1993 original, and a climactic, triumphant nod to another of his works. Also, the finale is every bit as silly and over-the-top as it's thunderous and deliriously fun.Pratt is perfectly, heroically dashing as Owen. Bryce Dallas Howard is Pratt's match as park operations manager Claire Dearing, the by- the-numbers, uptight corporate type who must be swayed and kissed. But the film wouldn't have been as entertaining as it is without its supporting players â Vincent D'Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Jake Johnson, and BD Wong. These actors imbue their cleverly written but actually thin characters with shadings and nuances that have little to do with the printed page. My only problem with the movie is that there's just not enough of the great Irrfan Khan.While the first hour of 'Jurassic World' cleverly sets things up for the ensuing mayhem, the second half is out-and-out, chest-rumbling, dino action. There's an ethical discussion throughout the 'Jurassic' movies about whether dinosaurs ever should have been cloned. But, thanks to 'Jurassic World', there's no debating the merits of bringing this franchise back from extinction.",9,11,32,17 July 2015
Prisoners," A Gut-Wrenching, Emotional, Unpredictable Thriller
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.1/5 starsAn edge-of-the-seat thriller in the truest sense of the term. You'll keep guessing right till the end and will never be able to see the shocking plot twists coming. Credit needs to be bestowed upon the Director and script writer. Supplementing their vision to great effect are the superlative skills amply displayed by the editor and cinematographer. What we get is a tense, somber, atmosphere with palpable tension and despair.And finally down to the performances. 'Prisoners' boasts of an ensemble cast and boy do they deliver the goods. Viola Davis and Terrence Howard bring a sense of grit and fortitude to the hopelessness they face in their concise roles, while Maria Bello is a picture of grief in her limited screen time. Paul Dano is a past master at playing complex characters and he pulls of yet another winner. Melissa Leo was all but unrecognizable until you realize it was her once the credits start rolling. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a sound and assured performance meriting an Oscar nomination in the supporting category.But it's Hugh Jackman who acts the hell out of his portrayal of a desperate father driven to a frantic edge. It is without question the best performance of his career and so far the performance of the year too. I think the best accolade that can be give to this fine actor is that his act in 'Prisoners' literally makes us forget his iconic role of 'Wolverine' in the 'X-Men' series and spin-offs.Along with being a nail-biting ride from start to finish, 'Prisoners' also succeeds in being an emotional roller-coaster and even involves the viewers by making us relate to the moral ambiguity of the protagonists, and the lengths to which they are willing to go to save a loved one.",9,1,2,20 October 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Blissful Blitzkrieg
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.2/5 starsWith 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', Marvel Studios' crown jewel of its billion dollar franchise captures lighting in a bottle again. That 'Ultron' is every bit the ridiculously entertaining, goofy grin- inducer as its 2012 predecessor makes this even more impressive. With 'The Avengers', we didn't really know what to expect, but now the expectations are set, and with Hawkeye-like precision 'Ultron' meets them in a way that audiences should leave thoroughly satisfied.Director-Writer Joss Whedon assembles Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) for another epic big screen adventure. It kicks off with a battle against Hydra forces that pits them into a brief conflict with the speedster Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and telekinetic/mind-manipulating Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). The twins have an agenda against Iron Man, and set in motion plans that will have serious repercussions for everyone involved.Whedon smartly advances the story beyond the events of the great battle in New York, showcasing The Avengers as a highly-efficient fighting unit instead of a ragtag group of individuals banding together every so often. As we catch up with them, The Avengers have been on several unseen missions and bonded as friends, best exemplified as the team holds a party with their allies (including some fan favorite supporting characters from the solo films) to celebrate tying up a loose end from their encounter with Loki (Tom Hiddleston). That loose end wasn't resolved as neatly as they originally thought as their encounter with the twins leads to The Avengers being confronted by a new enemy, the android Ultron (voiced by James Spader).Ultron has the traditional, cold mechanical look, but Spader gives him a surprising personality that makes him the best Marvel villain since Loki - still the gold standard of MCU villainy. In addition, how Whedon works in The Vision (Paul Bettany) is also largely faithful to the source material with a modern twist to flow within the established movie continuity. The Avengers also get serious mileage out of their Quinjet this outing as the team battles in South Africa, England, Italy, and Korea to really give credence to the whole Earth's Mightiest Heroes tagline â not just in New York.Whedon's specialty has always been the personal relationships between his characters, and despite the numerous majestic action sequences, the character interplay isn't affected one bit, showing that blockbusters don't have to be brainless. Downey Jr. remains the snarky, slightly cocky comic relief, Evans further asserts himself as the leader of an eclectic cast, while Hemsworth gives Thor a great turn as the decisive hot head. In fact, each cast member gets welcome moments to shine, but Renner is the most unexpected scene- stealer as he continually questions his place among soldiers, gods, and green behemoths.With a $250 million budget, Marvel Studios and Disney sunk a lot of the other green into the film, but the money was well spent. Case in point being the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster Iron Man scene that delivers everything you'd want and then some, but the other fight scenes are just as enthralling especially when Whedon pans the camera to shift from one character to the next in the heat of battle. And the climactic scene is pretty much guaranteed to leave comic fans grinning from ear to ear watching the assembled Avengers in action.'Ultron' comes across as even more of a love letter for Avengers fans than the first installment. Of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, 'Ultron' feels the most like a comic book story arc and less traditional summer blockbuster. Unlike Marvel's 'The Avengers', which was the nice and tidy final act to the Phase 1 introduction films, 'Ultron' is less the conclusion of one act, but another pit stop across a firmly established Marvel Universe. Whedon, in the vein of the great Avengers comic book writers including Kurt Busiek, Stan Lee, Jim Shooter, and Roy Thomas, knows this isn't the culmination of an ambitious project, but the springboard to the next round of adventures. As such Whedon, who built his career as a TV Writer - Director, makes 'Ultron' more episodic with a slew of foreshadows and hints of what's to come. Scarlet Witch's mind manipulations reveal the team's worst fears that give us glimpses of The Avengers' past and potential future, which is especially troubling to Stark and Thor. For comic book fans, the teases of the next big story lines are going to feel like comic book nirvana as they anxiously await the next stop on the journey. For the casual fan, the teases to 'Captain America: Civil War', 'Black Panther', 'Thor: Ragnarok', and 'Infinity War' may seem like information overload with no immediate answers, but as future films pick up these plot threads, it will make far more sense and only serve to make 'Ultron' stronger as more pieces fall in place. I'm already salivating at the prospect of watching a Marvel marathon once the Phase 3 films are complete with 'Avengers: Infinity War Part 2' in 2019.Without being really nitpicky, I don't know how 'Age of Ultron' could have been better. Avengers fans will walk out the theater completely jubilant, and the only disappointment they'll experience is when realization dawns that 370 days remain until their next Avengers fix with 'Captain America: Civil War'. May as well kill time by watching 'Ultron' a few more times in the theater. Casual fans will go home with the feeling that every penny was well spent on the action blockbuster bonanza.",7,3,8,10 May 2015
Everest," Worth Watching Just for its Cinematography and Effects and Pretty Much Nothing Else
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3/5 stars'Everest' boasts all the dizzying cinematography a person could hope to get from a movie about mountain climbers in today's times, even if it's content to tread a less challenging narrative terrain. Sadly, the scenes of peril and danger don't have the breathtaking, gut- wrenching wallop you'd expect from a movie about people pitting themselves against the highest peak on the planet, even if the visuals do well in establishing where the many climbers were on the mountain on that fateful day, and the very real, mortal dangers that lurk beneath the beauty of this place.What's really remarkable and effective about 'Everest' is that, on a visual level, it's thoroughly convincing. There is not a single moment here that looks like it was computer-generated or shot against a green-screen, though in actuality it was. Also, the film succeeds in showing the logistics necessary in such a climb.Eventually, 'Everest' is worth seeing because of the visual beauty and daring camera-work involved. The story itself is a downer and only accomplishes in highlighting the folly and insurmountable risks of such a trek. If you do decide to see it, make sure you get the 3D, IMAX treatment â it's so involving that you leave the theater checking for frostbite and never wanting to look at a mountain again, which in all probability is this movie's actual accomplishment.",7,9,15,28 September 2015
Elysium," A Solid Sci-Fi Effort
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.5/5 starsIs it as good as 'District 9â³? No. But it's still a gripping sci-fi effort from director Neill Blomkamp. Anyways, 'District 9â³ was a masterpiece that's probably hard to replicate, and it's simply unfair to judge a Director's subsequent works to his best films. Comparison are inevitable and understandable, but a film should ultimately be judged on its own merits, and with that note, 'Elysium is a thoroughly enjoyable futuristic vision, that's only gets derailed at certain remotely sporadic junctures, due to a degree of over indulgence in plot contrivances.The film is still worth the price of an admission ticket, because of its scope, taut narration, and Jodie Foster's deviously sinister act (seriously, the lady can effortlessly just breeze through any role). Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley are as reliable as ever.",7,0,1,8 September 2013
Selma," A King-Size Movie and a King-Size Performance for a King-Size Historical Figure
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.6/5 starsFueled by a gripping performance from David Oyelowo, 'Selma' draws inspiration and dramatic power from the life and death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. while also not ignoring how far we remain from the ideals his work embodied. The movie manages to beautifully articulate a pivotal moment in history â one that is hauntingly ironic in how it echoes our current times and society. It's a blast of piercing social insight expressed through exquisite craftsmanship by Director, Ava DuVernay (unpardonably robbed of a Best Director nomination at this year's Oscars), which makes it feel like art and not bald-faced messaging. On top of all of its many other virtues, 'Selma' is an inspiring movie about politics and a large-scale human movement done right. A masterclass in directing, the film is a gripping, hard-hitting, and moving depiction of events in early 1965 as it chronicles Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.What's absolutely credible about the film is that it focuses on the one thing we don't expect in a movie about Martin Luther King â his doubts â and Oyelowo comes through with a deeply felt and quite brilliant performance. He completely disappears into the persona of Martin Luther â diction, body language, oratory skills and all. Oyelowo's breakout performance should have rightly earned him an Oscar nomination (another major snub for this film). Nevertheless, it will be remembered by film lovers around the world for years to come. A number of historical dramas fall into the trap of sugar- coating the details of their subject matter in order to stress the qualities of their main protagonist. 'Selma' does not display any such shortcoming as it refreshingly presents its main character as a flawed but inspirational figure. Cracking the civil rights leader and his associates from their plaster-saint cocoons, this latest offering on a one of Martin Luther's many emphatic triumphs presents a multidimensional portrayal of Dr. King, flaws and all, and succinctly demonstrates that we've both come a long way and have a long way to go. What makes the film â and a few of its shortcomings â such a vital work is how relevant its depiction of the events of 50 years ago are to today. While Oyelowo grabs this richly-scripted character by the scruff of its neck and leads the way, he's marvelously supported by a talented bunch of supporting cast members. The camaraderie and heated arguments demonstrated by the large and impressive ensemble of African-American character actors, beautifully capture the essence of the personalities and issues of those times.Politics, segregation, and basic human rights, are just a few themes explored throughout this film, and all are done to pure perfection. Films about black rights have had highs and lows through the years, from being preachy to monotonous to breezily entertaining to just missing the mark to downright awful. 'Selma' is among the few that falls in that rarest of rare categories of being truly incredible. Uniquely filmed, superbly written, and downright enthralling, this picture is one for the ages. I felt myself immersed in the lives of this group of individuals as they fought to earn respect and start a revolution. Inspiring, heart-pumping, and thought-provoking, 'Selma' delivers the raw emotion many films lack these days, and for that, I can't give it enough credit. I was moved from beginning to end â the film is nothing short of being breathtaking. It's not just required viewing because it addresses issues that unfortunately exist in contemporary society; it's required viewing because it's a freaking fantastic film.As the 50th anniversary of the events it depicts approaches, 'Selma' feels chillingly contemporary, all too real, and monumental in more ways than one. Almost half a century since President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill giving everyone the unquestionable right to vote, America and several other nations are still struggling with similar issues today. How is that even possible? It's a movie, yes. But this stirring account of the fight to end racially motivated voting impediments in the Deep South is more than anything a much- needed wake-up-call for a country that has seriously lost its way in terms of equality. For this reason alone, such a phenomenally stirring production should be seen by everyone who believes in racial equality, and even more so by anyone who doesn't. Inspiring and impassioned, 'Selma' has the power to enrage and enlighten while delivering Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's reverberating message of perseverance of the human spirit.",9,1,3,18 January 2015
Sicario," A Gritty, Pragmatist Look at the Drug War on the U.S. Border
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsWith unjust police shootings and guys like John Connolly making deals with Whitey Bulger, it's getting near impossible to tell the good guys from the bad. Emily Blunt no doubt would agree after what she goes through as FBI agent Kate Macy in the kill-or-be-killed thriller 'Sicario.' Kate's the proverbial babe â and I mean babe â in the woods, a still wet-behind-the-ears agent working out of the Phoenix office. But she has moxie, that one ingredient necessary for every G-gal who's ever stumbled into a movie. Which is good, because she's going to need it after receiving a can't-refuse invite to join a black-ops group tasked with using 'any means' to bring down a major drug cartel working out of the body-strewn war zone known as Juarez.The force of black SUV-driving water-torturers is led by Josh Brolin, the go-to guy when it comes to typecasting Texas shitkickers standing knee-deep in a pool of tough-guy sarcasm. He's Matt, which is about all Kate â or any of us â will ever know about him. No clue who he works for, or whose interests he represents, despite Kate's persistent inquiries. But compared to Benicio Del Toro's Alejandro, he's practically an open book.Making like Eastwood in a Spaghetti Western, Alejandro is an enigma of few words. He lets his automatic weapons do the talking â loud and lethal. His purpose, his presence are the film's central mysteries. He's also the likely reason the movie is titled 'Sicario,' which in the lexicon of Mexican gangsters means 'hitman'. He plays a character that's quite similar to the one he had portrayed in his Oscar- winning turn in Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic'. But 'Traffic' was so long ago (2000) that you've probably sufficiently forgotten Del Toro's portrayal of a Mexican cop hooking up with the DEA to bring down a drug lord. Well, it was a good part, so why not do it again? In fact, why not make 'Sicario' just like 'Traffic', sans the soap opera? That's clearly the thinking of wunderkind director Denis Villeneuve, who envelops his story in all the angst and gloominess we've come to expect from the guy who brought us ain't-no-sunshine joints like 'Prisoners' and 'Incendies'. He loves wallowing in the muck. And as hard as you resist, you like wallowing with him. Say what you will about the guy â that he exploits human frailty; that he hates happy endings â you can't deny that he knows how to entertain the pants off you, even though the 'entertainment' consists almost exclusively of murder and torture.With actor-turned-writer Taylor Sheridan ('Sons of Anarchy') at his side, Villeneuve wastes no time bringing the dread by opening with a 'Straight Outta Compton'-like drug raid that ends in multiple deaths. And that's not counting all the people who were already deceased, their bodies encased in plastic and jammed between the studs of a bullet-riddled Phoenix crack house. All are suspected victims of Fausto Alarcon (Julio Cedillo), the cartel boss an unsuspecting Kate is about to play an unsavory hand in bringing down.The film thrives on Villeneuve's keen eye for action. Aided immensely by uber-cinematographer Roger Deakins (a shoo-in for his 13th Oscar nomination), Villeneuve turns your nerves into a twist with two masterful action sequences. The first involving a terrifying shootout on the Bridge of Americas, and the second a nighttime raid inside a crudely dug desert tunnel that Deakins films with an infrared camera that perfectly sets an eerie, foreboding mood as blood and ideals are spilled in a barrage of bullets. It's simply breathtaking, as is the final scene, like 'Traffic', set on an athletic field. It will not only haunt you, but it will also â this is for you Donald Trump â drive home the reason so many people will do anything to flee to the U.S.What's not so great is the flat storytelling, which presents precious little of what's at stake for the characters, particularly Alejandro. The entire film builds and builds to his climactic moment of revenge porn. It's powerful, but not as intently as it could have been if Villeneuve created a more palpable sense of suspense. Still the performances are strong, and Deakins is amazing, doing for normally boring, bland desert-scapes what he did for the snowbound tundra in 'Fargo'. In fact, his ingenious camera-work is 'Sicario's most addictive drug. Whether that's enough to get audiences high remains to be seen. But even with all its impurities, 'Sicario' remains pretty kick-ass dope.",7,0,1,2 January 2016
Steve Jobs," A Job Partially Well Done
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsThough it'll undoubtedly have a more profound effect on those with a deeper knowledge of Apple's history or who share a fervent relationship with every product the company launches, 'Steve Jobs' is nonetheless an affecting piece of cinema that boldly chooses a stark portrayal of the tech giant's late CEO without ever veering into the degradation or canonization of its eponymous subject. Set backstage at three iconic product launches and ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac, 'Steve Jobs' takes us behind the scenes of Apple's digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of its cofounder.Aaron Sorkin's screenplay and Danny Boyle's Direction offers a Steve Jobs profile that doesn't idolize or criticize him, providing us valuable insight to the man's life and other important individuals who impacted it. But that insight feels incomplete and unrefined at various points in the film, because Sorkin's (usually impeccable) writing keeps treading into theatrical, garrulous, and, dare I say, even self-indulgent territory to metamorphose into a truly involving experience.Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet create all the drama, intensity, conflict, and dynamism required to propel Aaron Sorkin's minimalist screenplay into grander terrain, but the film is simultaneously inspiring and frustrating, much like the individual it's based on. In particular, Fassbender's performance is a striking accomplishment of restraint merged seamlessly with command, as he portrays Jobs as a charming, amiable, and engrossing person in one scene, and a conflicted, revolting, contemptuous monster in the next. With due respect to all the other Oscar nominees this year, Fassbender deserves adulation for getting through stanzas of intricate, chatty dialogue alone. And, though, the movie never matches the caliber of its leading man's sublime performance, it's nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, inspiring and frustrating at the same time. Perhaps, more inspiring than it is frustrating, and that's still a pretty good thing.",7,10,16,18 February 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," A Deftly Calibrated Sci-Fi Spectacle
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.4/5 starsThe conceit may sound constricting, but Director, Doug Liman gets exceptional mileage out of it, presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style, narrative velocity, and a wonderful dose of dark humor. Ultimately, it's is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it exceedingly well to churn out an instant sci-fi classic. The plot deals with an alien race that has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage (Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying again...and again...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside special forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt). As Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating the enemy. While this premise might sound derivative, be rest assured that the narrative is strewn with copious intricacies and unpredictable moments that demand your attention, lest you be left behind in the adrenaline-pumping, frantic pace of the film. More story than testosterone, more time-jump-cuts than spacey filler, and more war-as-hell than war-as-cool. The biggest achievement of the movies is that it leaves you pondering if we're 'masters of our fate' or just action figures going through the emotions in some supreme player's idea of a war game.Tom Cruise once again shows why he's still a bona-fide movie star and guaran-damn-tees us that he's got at least a few more years of leading man material left in his arsenal. Along with the gorgeous Emily Blunt â in a kick-ass role â he takes you on a (literally) loopy ride that's thoroughly entertaining and â baring a few pardonable moments in the second half â never wears out its welcome. The performances of Cruise and Blunt are spot on, with good supporting work from Bill Paxton, who plays a very hard-headed albeit somewhat humorous sergeant.The film is such a refreshing departure from the run-of-the-mill genre yarns of countless modern sci-fi blockbusters, and offers a fascinating and enjoyable vehicle that creates an ambitious illusion. All in all, a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun, and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we haven't seen the last of him yet. Smart, unpredictable, expertly-designed, well- acted, astutely directed, shrewdly-edited, and boasting impressive special effects, 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a model example of the sci-fi genre and summer blockbuster done right.",9,0,2,21 September 2014
Whiplash," One of the Most Intense, Complex, and Brilliantly Acted Film Ever
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.8/5 starsAndrew Neyman, a young and talented drummer attending a prestigious music conservatory finds himself under the wing of the most respected professor at the school, Terence Fletcher, one who does not hold back on abuse towards his students - an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods. Leading the top jazz ensemble in the school, Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life. Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability-and his sanity. The two form an odd relationship as the student tries to achieve greatness, and the professor will stop at nothing to realize his potential.Intense, inspiring, and well-acted, 'Whiplash' is a brilliant sophomore effort from Director Damien Chazelle, and a riveting vehicle for actors Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Chazelle delivers a dark and dazzling jive into the hidden world of competitive music. If you didn't think music could involve actual blood, sweat, and tears, this breathtakingly visceral, coming-of-artistic-age drama will set you straight. Training a keen eye on the proceedings, the Director seems to delight in the spectacle of relentless punishment.What gives the film such a kick, is its raw and brutal but also very subtle portrayal of the shifting, attritional relations between teacher and student, sorcerer and apprentice - a hugely entertaining, refreshingly subversive take on the well-worn 'inspirational teacher' theme: Few relationships in recent cinema have been quite so compelling. Miles Teller's Andrew pounds the drum skins as if his life depended on it. With J K Simmons' chair chucker Fletcher around, it very nearly might. Their relationship is so intense, nerve-wracking, dark, and incredibly complex, I suggest you take a defibrillator to 'Whiplash', since the chances of cardiac arrest or spontaneous combustion during Simmons' and Teller's many run-ins and showdowns are high. The climax proves to be the tip of the iceberg, and is as gripping and as unexpected as one you've ever seen or will get to see.As infectious as the screenplay and Direction of 'Whiplash' are, it's the acting that walks away with the most accolades. J.K. Simmons proves - as most of us already knew - he's a great actor, and deserves way more than being recognized as 'that actor from said blockbuster' or for doing 30-second commercials as a spokesman for an insurance company. Simmons is unnervingly good as a teacher who rules by intimidation and his own contorted theories, and excels in 'Whiplash's' hand-to-the throat storytelling style. To say he's brilliant would be a gross understatement. Miles Teller - who is actually a drummer - convinces us that he's easily among the best of a new crop of young actors from Hollywood's roster. Here is new kid on the block who's willing to stretch his horizons and take on difficult roles. He's wonderful in this one and almost goes toe-to- toe with Simmons.Compelling, compulsive, and excruciatingly funny, 'Whiplash' commands that you never take your eyes off the screen. Come the last beat, you'll probably be exhausted. But you'll also feel darkly entertained, inspired, introspective, and wonderfully alive. As the credits roll, you'll feel like giving 'Whiplash' a standing ovation.",9,0,2,1 February 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 'Birdman' Never Really Takes Flight
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.5/5 starsA former action film star attempts to make a comeback with a Broadway production. In 'Birdman' , Michael Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, a veteran film actor who is eager to rebuild his reputation. Like Keaton, Thomson is largely remembered for playing a superhero 25 years ago. And, like Keaton, he has spent much of the intervening quarter of a century explaining why he abdicated from that role â in Thomson's case, Birdman 4; Keaton, meanwhile, turned his back on Batman. Riggan had played the flying superhero Birdman three times and refused 'Birdman 4,' and his career went into free fall; Keaton, who, of course, played Batman twice and refused to do it a third time, and whose career â if not exactly in free fall â hasn't been filled of late with plum roles. In the movie, Thomson is heralded by the public as a onetime action hero, and is now playing an earnest, arty role in his own adaptation and stage production of a short story by Raymond Carver.There is no doubt that 'Birdman' features some of the finest work in Michael Keaton's and Edward Norton's careers, and another stellar, constant work of cinematography by the veteran, Emmanuel Lubezki, who makes each frame look captivating and frenetically eye-candy at the same time. However, the story is a hodgepodge of dangling plot threads and missed opportunities. While it is true that Keaton's protagonist carries the film, the subplots with his daughter, the lesbian affair, and the failing marriage never tie into Riggin's journey, and these sections of the film leave you with more questions than answers. Initially, the plot is straightforward enough: it's a backstage satire, set over a handful of days, as Thomson directs and acts in his Broadway adaptation in a bid for artistic credibility. The first hour is essentially a Ray Cooney bedroom farce, full of rutting egos and romantic entanglements. All it lacks is for someone to accidentally drop their trousers in front a visiting vicar. Thomson's co-star, Mike Shiner (Norton), is the epitome of strutting, method-acting excess. He is also involved in a fraying relationship with the play's leading lady, Leslie (Naomi Watts); even as Shiner upsets the production, Thomson learns that his girlfriend, Laura (Andrea Riseborough) â and second female lead â is pregnant, while his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) is fresh out of rehab and struggling. Gradually, strange kinks assert themselves in the narrative: moments where Thomson levitates cross-legged in mid air, or takes flight across the New York rooftops. Along the way, Director, Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu, and director of photography, Lubezki, let the film appear as if unspooling in a single take. It's a nice piece of artifice; but much like the film itself, it's a superficial rather than substantial attraction.The actors digs at narcissism, ambition, insecurity, the wages of celebrity, and the 'cultural genocide' of Hollywood verge on the indulgent. 'The play is starting to feel like a deranged, deformed version of myself,' Thomson says at one point. Ha, ha, yes; we get it! The second hour strips back every outstanding plot point to focus entirely on Thomson's meltdown as opening night approaches. But it's difficult to engage with Thomson's plight: his character is depthless and self-absorbed, and IÃ±Ã¡rritu's film isn't half as clever as it thinks it is.Also, the last shot of the film seems to change the rules established by the first hour and fifty-eight minutes. Overall, while the 'Birdman's' performances are a joy to watch, the story fails to have any cohesion.",5,3,10,11 January 2015
The Big Short," Great Performances All Round in an Entertaining if Slightly Cluttered Movie
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.3/5 starsAdam McKay admirably directs an all-star cast comprising Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt in this surprisingly light-hearted and entertaining take on America's housing bubble collapse of the mid- and late-2000s, which eventually led to a global financial crisis. However, if you're not well-acquainted with the world of finance and several of its nitty-gritty details, the clumpy narrative and salvo of banking gobbledygook in 'The Big Short' might cause your attention to drift at at some points in the movie.Though the film comes across as a tad bloated at 130 minutes, it still impresses quite a bit with all that it packs within its frames. It's evident McKay and his co-writer Charles Randolph try their best to make the banking jargon as easy as possible for the audience to comprehend, even going so far as using the game Jenga and on-screen graphics to describe the fragility and ultimate decimation of the economy. At key intervals, the filmmakers even employ the assistance of guest stars from Margot Robbie to Selena Gomez to 5-star chef Anthony Bourdain in their endeavor to help the common man wrap his/her head around all the complex financial terminology. Unfortunately, this also makes 'The Big Short' feel impersonal, and you feel there's too much of emphasis on number- crunching, statistics, office meetings, boardroom talks, and predictions. You end up wishing that some of this care and effort was directed toward highlighting the well-known human suffering resulting from this economic meltdown.Still, McKay does more than a decent job at offering copious food for thought on how not to live and how intricate, and, more importantly, fickle the financial system really is. Best-known for collaborating with Will Ferrell in comedies like the 'Anchorman' films, 'Talladega Nights', and 'Step Brothers', McKay never forgoes an opportunity to add some much-needed wit and satirical humor to proceedings, which helps in easing out the heavy narrative to an extent.Undoubtedly, it's the actors' sublime performances that have helped 'The Big Short' soar to such heights this awards-season. And, in spite of all the praise, awards, and a third Oscar nomination that's come Bale's way - and he indeed does an exemplary job as he's so often done all through his career - it's Steve Carell who shines brightest out of the extremely talented ensemble cast.",7,0,0,13 February 2016
The Conjuring," Easily Among The Top 50 Horror Movies Of All Time
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.1/5 starsJames Wan ('Saw', 'Insidious'), has carved out yet another horror masterpiece. 'The Conjuring' is psychologically disturbing and also scary as hell. Mr. Wan delectably creates palpable tension and a nerve- wracking atmosphere by smartly playing around with camera angles and lights - laudable qualities that he's already exhibited in his previous efforts.But there are also plenty of jump-scare moments, without the Director resorting to any cheap thrills or mundane horror clichÃ©s. The plot though not novel, is based on a true story and is executed with gusto and freshness. Among the performances, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, and Lili Taylor truly stand out.The penultimate scene and the epic climax - again to the Director's credit - are among the best ever in horror movie history - and that's really something considering the plethora of classics 'The Conjuring' is stacked against. Mr. James Wan - please take a bow once again. You Sir, shall definitely cement your position one day among the likes of Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Frank Darabont, and other masters of horror films.",9,0,2,4 August 2013
The Wolverine," Slightly Tarnishes the Legacy of the Brilliantly Received X-Men Franchise
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3/5 starsNot as good as any of the previous X-Men films, including the under- appreciated 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. Some actions scenes are very well done, but the rest fall pretty flat, including the anti-climatic finale. The plot does resemble one of our clawed superhero's fable comic books, but it isn't executed to perfection or anywhere near it. Plus, some necessary back-story's and character arcs weren't properly developed we are left feeling a bit cheated.In hindsight, if it wasn't for the charismatic Hugh Jackman, 'The Wolverine' mightn't have even turned out to be half decent as it is. Here's hoping that Wolverine's next solo effort surpasses or is at least as good as the character's first cinematic installment.",6,2,6,3 August 2013
The Croods," Of Unfulfilled Promises and Underachieved Efforts
","Rating: 2.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Some nice scenes and refreshing dialogs strung together along with brilliant visuals just about manage to help this animated venture stay afloat. The first half of the movie is what really lets it down with random hurried scenes and a blatant disregard for the law of physics. I agree that an animated film is permitted to take certain liberties, but they should be taken with the permissible constraints of the film's environment and its script. Going overboard with these liberties becomes intolerable after a certain point of time. For instance, there's no way that a human being, leave alone an infant, can run faster than a wild cat or an ostrich-like prehistoric bird.From the second half onwards, the movie begins the ease up and starts focusing more on its characters and their interactions. Most notable of all is the endearing representation of the father-daughter relationship and the young guy who decides to help their family. The climax again begins on an enthusing note only to stumble into confounding territory that totally defies logic and rationale.Eventually, 'The Croods' joins the ranks of an alarmingly increasing plethora of animated films nowadays that promise a lit, convinces us at the onset that it just might deliver on its promises, but alas, disappoints us in the end with the felling of what could have been.",6,1,6,10 July 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Review: You know you've sunk to a new low when last year's Fantastic Four is no longer the most boring superhero movie ever
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1/5 stars'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' derails a potentially powerful story along with some of the most iconic heroes of comic folklore for an obsession with dark tones and darker themes that are all just a poor excuse for mimicking Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' masterpiece. While that trilogy was by far the darkest of all superhero movies, it was also extremely engrossing, thoroughly entertaining, and overall fun to watch, with even a bit of humor strewn here and there - elements that Director Zack Snyder and writer completely forgot were intrinsic to a superhero film's success. They all don't have to provide as much fun and humor as Marvel's movies (though 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' showed that Marvel can even find a much darker tone amidst their staple fun times), but in aiming for everything dark and grimy under the night sky, things certainly don't need to get lifeless and morose.'Dawn of Justice' is plainly and simply a shockingly joyless and overtly prolonged affair that presents its two beacons of justice as angry, cranky, melancholic, gullible men-in-tights. As far as the acting goes: Irons and Adams aren't given any scope to showcase their superlative acting chops; Affleck looks the part but can't act the part; for some inexplicable reason Snyder is still adamant about not allowing Cavill to act when he's proved that he most certainly can; and Eisenberg desperately needs a new acting style. Add to that the big, loud, bloated nature of the film, with everything transpiring within it feeling vacuous, and you end with a profoundly dissatisfying movie- watching experience that's ugly, incoherent, and unmitigatedly boring in every sense.I mean, when Alfred couldn't care less about what his beloved Master Bruce does anymore, or if Wonder Woman has better things to do than save the world, we should probably take a cue and leave this hot, steaming pile of dump in the doldrums where it belongs.",1,11,24,3 April 2016
Lucy," The Big-Hokum Theory
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 1.5/5 starsBesson is falling further and further into doldrums; whether it be his recent and even not-so-recent directorial or scripting efforts. 'Taken' and 'District B13' aside, and to some extend 'The Family' (and two of those were only scripted by him), none of his projects in the past 10 years or so even past muster, and 'Lucy' is yet another massive blotch on his repertoire.The film is beyond inane - it's flaws, plot-holes, and downright absurdity are so vivid, and so many, that it would be a herculean task even to list them. Part farcical-scientific treatise, part messed-up action movie - a film that oscillates between rambunctious disorientation and complete boredom in a heartbeat. And, for a movie that worries about most of humanity wasting its potential, it's ironical that 'Lucy' is riddled with so many nonsensical scenes. Even though the titular character may find her brainpower exponentially increasing as the film's run-time moves forward, chances are you'll feel your IQ levels diminishing and your intellect being assaulted just as rapidly.'Lucy' is more or less the same kind of illogical gibberish we've come to except from post-2005 era Besson. Is this really the same talent that gave us classics like 'LÃ©on: The Professional', 'The Fifth Element', and 'La Femme Nikita'. Right now it's sad to see that he isn't even a reflection of the man who penned crackerjack scripts such as 'Taken' and 'District B13'. Oh...how the might have fallen!",3,1,6,27 October 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Has Indeed Awakened
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsJ.J. Abrams and his crew have restored the shine to our beloved story, and then some. Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy.The film begins three decades after the defeat of Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire, when a new threat known as the First Order has arisen and attempts to rule the galaxy once again with tyranny and ruthlessness, just as the Empire had done many decades ago. Enter Rey, a scavenger from the planet Jakku, who finds a BB-8 droid that knows the whereabouts of the long-vanished Luke Skywalker. Along with a rogue stormtrooper and two well-known smugglers, the rag-tag group of heroes team up with the Resistance to stop the daunting legions of the First Order.What works the most in favor of this latest entrant to the space saga is the dexterity, fluency, and zip with which each scene flows, and seamlessly blends with all the exhilarating action, smart humor, and indelible dialogues; nothing ever feels out of place - Abrams delivers a tour-de-force in the act of pure storytelling. Another highlight is the crop of new characters - well-written and fleshed out with intrigue and promising back stories without revealing too much in one go. They play well with and against each other as also with some of the grizzled veterans now ready to make way for younger blood to take over the mantle.And it all climaxes with the right elements (though many die-hard fans will be left fuming or at least inconsolable at one shocking development that transpires toward the denouement), tantalizing us and setting things up brilliantly for the next installment. Secret threads on social media are already picking their nits and debating theories; it's going to be a tough wait to see what happens next.",10,5,33,27 December 2015
Unbroken," Hugely Inspiring but Lacks that Edge
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.6/5 starsWar is hell, but few soldiers endured as much purgatory and perdition as Louis Zamperini. As such, his story is a compelling one that shows just how much the human spirit and body can endure. Unfortunately this tale of survival has little else to offer beyond its tale of survival.Near the beginning of 'Unbroken' there's an action sequence of astonishing power - an aerial battle - mostly set inside the U.S. aircraft as it outmaneuvers, outwits, and ultimately overpowers rival Japanese aircrafts. This sequence is so well handled that expectations are raised very high that Jolie may have come up with a classic war film. But as the film proceeds, we realize that this is not to be.In many ways Louis Zamperini's life was a miracle. The wayward son of Italian immigrants, he would go on to find his calling as a long distance runner, and represent America at both the 1936 Olympic Games as well as a bombardier in WWII, where he became a prisoner of war and survived a harrowing ordeal at the hands of the Japanese army. Refusing to have his spirit broken, Zamperini lived out the rest of his days as a dedicated Christian and inspirational speaker until his death a mere 7 months ago.Flashbacks tell Zamperini's story, from his boyhood as an Italian- American in a Californian backwater (photographed, like most of the movie, in Australia), to his success as a runner at the 1936 Berlin Olympics and his war experiences. After crash-landing into the ocean during a routine mission, he and his surviving mates spend 47 days in a rubber raft before being captured by the Japanese Navy, and enduring the hell of two prisoner-of-war camps.Just as an inexperienced coach of a big-market team is surrounded by veteran talent to make their job easier, Jolie is flanked by a stellar crew that have helped make 'Unbroken' one of the better technically crafted films of the year, with special mention to the eternal Roger Deakins' crisp, vivid cinematography, and the excellent work by the film's sound department.Exceptional too are the performances, especially by Jack O'Connell who caps off an extraordinary breakthrough year (which includes brilliant lead turns in 'Starred Up' and ''71') with an all- encompassing turn as Zamperini, giving body and a palpable, unshakeable strength to a man whose physical and mental torture only invigorated his resolve. As the ill-fated runner/soldier, O'Connell effectively portraying the pain, stoicism and large emotional range the role requires. Another noteworthy performance comes from Ishihara, as the Japanese POW camp commander, Mutsuhiro 'Bird' Watanabe, who conveys the right amount of repulsiveness - sans any caricatured bits - for us to genuinely loathe him.Hence, it's certainly no fault of O'Connell's and the supporting cast that we don't get a clear understanding of what made Zamperini tick. That fault lies with the script, which so focused on its events that it forgets to give us much in the way of the story's characters â highly surprising considering the writing talent involved (the Coen brothers, among four writers, drafted the screenplay from Laura Hillenbrand's book. As a result, Zamperini is portrayed as little more than 'the guy that survived' - we get no sense of what he was like as a man beyond the fact that his spirit was 'unbreakable', and that he was a fairly decent guy. We are left with no idea about what really drove him and kept him going through such horrific experiences, and even less of an idea about his fellow POWs.An audience is always going to care more about people if they get to know them, but there is little in the way of introductions or development for these POWs. It's really only the relentless weight of their suffering that allows the film to break through emotionally, and as such it feels like 'Unbroken' sells its subjects short.It's hard to fault Jolie's direction too much either. The film takes a little while to get going but moves at a decent pace in its latter half. She also avoids making the necessary violence overtly gratuitous. The problem lies with the script and its 'events, not characters' approach. Also, the movie is not filled with scintillating dialogue or amazing set pieces - although the opening aerial dog fight is pretty cool and the Olympic sequence is done well - so without character depth to drive the necessary emotional punch we are left with little more beyond an hour of hardship.I guess if one were to fault Jolie's direction it would have to be in her hurriedness to conclude Zamperini's amazing journey. While she does not flinch in depicting the inhumane, despicable brutality which Zamperini endured, there is too much fixation on the savagery which befell this man, and not enough time dedicated to Zamperini's post- war journey into a strong Christian belief, that saw him eventually forgive the captors that tormented him. There is an entire third act missing from 'Unbroken' that was needed to bring things full circle. With Jolie's strong bond with Zamperini during his last days, one would think that she would know it wasn't just the dark moments during the war that encapsulated his life, but also the power of grace and forgiveness that drew him from the shadows and into the light.It's that kind of thing that great filmmakers pick up on and form into great movies. One day Jolie may well get that instinct. She has talent, no doubt about that, and may one day make a really outstanding film. As for 'Unbroken', the film is certainly worth a look as it's a compelling story, but you will walk away knowing what happened to Zamperini and not who Zamperini really was. Jolie's second directorial stint could be considered as more of a strong learning curve than a grand statement.",7,0,2,25 January 2015
Happy New Year," The Great Diwali Blast
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 stars'Happy New Year' is a typical Bollywood mass entertainer, the likes of which can only be made by Bollywood. It bears the term 'Indiawaale' in its tagline and rightly so, because it's a film meant for Indians to enjoy and indulge in. Only someone who has grown up on a healthy dosage of Bollywood films, can appreciate and even be thoroughly entertained by 'Happy New Year'.It's quintessential masala fare to its core, and proves that masala films can be entertaining without defying logic. In fact, the fact that the film has a decent plot and a narrative style that holds true for most parts of its 3-hour length, actually makes it way more entertaining that many other similar efforts that have bastardized the Bollywood-born masala genre in recent times â a la 'Kick', 'Rowdy Rathore', 'Singham', 'Bodyguard', 'Ek Tha Tiger', and many more. So wholesome is 'Happy New Year's' entertainment quotient that it actually evokes nostalgia of some of the best masala entertainers from a bygone era of Bollywood such as 'Amar Akbar Anthony', 'Hum Kisise Kum Nahi', 'Yaadon ki Baaraat', and 'Namak Halal' â the kind specialized by Directors like Nasir Hussain, Manmohan Desai, and Prakash Mehra, which says a lot of the improvement displayed by Farah Khan.Though the film has its dull moments, logical loopholes, and narrative flaws â which was to be expected from a Farah Khan film â they are few and far between a script that's for the most part riddled with laugh-out-loud funny moments and a well-planned heist â the heist is surprisingly well-executed and is actually the highlight of the movie. Besides this, the script checks all the boxes that make for a good Bollywood masala movie: revenge, friendship, underdogs, romance, comedy, fights, dances, multiple costume changes, foreign locations, and a happy ending. The premise itself is a recipe for no-holds- barred fun. Charlie (Shah Rukh Khan) wants to avenge diamond baron Charan Grover (Jackie Shroff) who framed his father on a robbery charge some eight years ago. He plans to do this by robbing a safe that is placed many feet below the World Dance Championships stage in Dubai. In order to successfully pull off this heist, he enlists a Parsi safe cracker with an epilepsy condition (Boman Irani), a hearing-impaired bomb expert (Sonu Sood), a drunk with a vomiting problem (Abhishek Bachchan), and a geeky computer hacker (Vivaan Shah). All these men have two left feet. So in order to make their entry into the dance event plausible, he ropes in bar dancer (Deepika Padukone) to choreograph their moves.The performances also blend seamlessly with the proceedings on screen with each other portraying their roles as required.Shahrukh as expected carries the film almost inconspicuously on his shoulders, but he's ably supported by Boman, Abhishek, and Deepika. Abhishek and Deepika literally walk away with some of the scenes, that too in the presence of the mighty Khan, which also speaks volumes of the camaraderie of the cast and in particular of the shrewdness of Khan as a producer, knowing full well that an ensemble cast only clicks when each actor is given prominence (wish some other superstars in the industry would also realize this). Sonu Sood and Vivaan Shah also play their parts effectively.But the biggest surprise package is Farah Khan, and the level of maturity she displays at handling a film of this magnitude. 'Happy New Year' is that masala film with strong repeat value Bollywood fans have been waiting for ages â denied by myriad imposters out to deceive audiences. Go for it this Diwali, take your friends and family along, then go for it again, and have a gala time at the movies.",8,15,30,28 October 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Epitomizes the Definition of the Term, 'A Total Blast'
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.4/5 starsStylish, subversive, and above all fun, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' finds Director Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass', 'X-Men: First Class') reinventing the rules of spy films with gleeful abandon. Yes it's completely bonkers, totally wacky, unabashedly over-the-top, and at times even indulgently campy, but it's also, downright, one of the most no-holds-barred, entertaining action-comedy romps you're bound experience in years. More importantly, it's a celebration of the fun-filled, lost art of political incorrectness.Based upon the acclaimed graphic novel by exalted comic book writer Mark Millar ('Kick-Ass') and illustrator Dave Gibbons, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Basically you need to imagine a Sean Connery James Bond movie with the potty dialect of 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels' and the action from 'The Raid' franchise. But there are numerous deviations from the source material - albeit of the extremely rare kind where the adaptation offers a refreshing take on your something you're already familiar with and immensely fond of - to the point where one could deduce that on day one of filming, the creators must have thrown away the moral compass and taken a group vow to splatter our sensibilities with stylish, gratuitous violence and one 'wait, what...?' moment after another.At its heart, 'Kingsman' is just as much a parody of James Bond and his spy genre cousins as the 'Austin Powers' franchise. Admittedly, it's not a full-on spoof like 'Austin Powers', but this action- comedy is very aware of the clichÃ©d world in which it operates. Eventually, it's an entertaining, endearing, delightful ode to spy flicks from the 1960s - a rowdy, amusing romp - spoofing the James Bond concept of dapper gentlemen involved in international intrigue. Still though 'Kingsman' is a loving homage to spy movies, it has just enough gravitas to stand as a memorable film in its own right.Much of the credit for this crackling adaptation from Millar's popular graphic novel goes to Director Matthew Vaughn, who, by now, has done more than enough to hold his own among the likes of Tarantino, Kurossawa, Spielberg, John McTiernan, and Eastwood as one of the best in the business when it comes to helming action movies. He keeps the action coming and astutely juggles numerous topics to deliver a vibrantly entertaining good time. Providing a sedate detour from the grizzly violence and insanely diabolical plot are the witty one- liners that range from eliciting chuckles to uproarious guffaws.Assisting Vaughn in delivering a seamlessly fun package is the top- notch cast. Oscar winners Firth and Caine add action star and sly backstabber to their resume with spirited aplomb. Firth's performance in particular is nothing short of a revelation; not in a million years one could've imagined that one day this serious, dramatic actor would clean house armed with nothing but his wit, charm, and a bulletproof umbrella. Jackson, clearly had a blast playing a megalomaniac, and camps it up in hilarious fashion. Newcomer Taron Egerton fares solidly as Eggsy, becoming the story's driving force, and evolves into a junior version of Firth, complete with tie, 1960s-style spectacles, and the aforementioned umbrella.This isn't for the politically correct or the faint of heart. But, if you're on its groovy, twisted wavelength, it's a stoned blast. A smarter spoof than 'Austin Powers' devoid of the over-seriousness of the 'Bond' movies, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is a stylishly assembled, crazy action-comedy, and a much-needed fresh take on spy movies.",9,4,13,7 March 2015
The Hangover Part III," Just like the first 'Hangover', this one is Destined to Achieve Cult Status in the Pantheons of R-rated Comedies
","Rating: 3.9/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)The blow hot-blow cold taste of the second installment has been completely washed away and we are fortunately left with evocative memories of the classic comedy of the first 'Hangover'. This film is quintessential R-rated hilarity at its sublime best. The kind of comedy that can even make absurdity look believable and flaws look inconsequential, just because it's so damn funny!Moreover, the film accomplishes the arduous task of never falling into the trap of vulgarity or going overboard with its expletive words and gratuitous obscenity - a fate suffered by many adult comedies just for the sake of extracting a few forced guffaws. Now I'm certainly no prude, and I love nothing more than some good R-rated fun, replete with abusive words, wicked scenes and a bit of obscenity thrown in for good measure. But good measure is what needs to be stressed on. It's when these gimmicks go overboard for lack of good content, inability to script funny scenes, or a dearth of hilarious dialogs and performances, that R- rated fun becomes an 'Un'-rated torment. Well, that being said, lets continue with the praises for this delightfully side-splitting film. 'Hangover Part 3' is overflowing with laugh-out-loud moments and hysterically funny dialogs, that are backed by the effortless comic timing of Bradley Cooper, the adorable goofiness of Ed Helms, the pseudo-flamboyance of John Goodman, and the devious wickedness of Ken Jeong (Mr. Chow) coupled wit his one-of-a-kind China-man accent.But, finally, it's Zach Galifianakis who completely steals the show from the first frame to the last. Make no mistake, 'Hangover Part 3' is Galifianakis' film out-and-out, and he potently shoulders it, proving, that in the end, its talent that ultimately talks in cinema and nothing else.P.S.:- Remember to stay back after the end credits start rolling. There's one last sequence you are treated to - like a final swansong to the 'Wolf Pack'. In fact it just might be the best after credits sequence yet, and it plays out more like a minute long short film. You also don't need to wait that long. A little bit into the credits, and this brilliant sequence pops up.",8,1,3,6 June 2013
Minions," Not Quite One in a Minion but Far From Despicable Either
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.5/5 starsThe Minions' brightly colored brand of gibberish-fueled insanity stretches to feature length in their self-titled 'Despicable Me' spin off, with uneven but often hilarious results. Admittedly, we had our doubts. Could the Minions carry their own film especially after last year's disastrous 'Penguins of Madagascar'. Thankfully, this spin off film takes the undifferentiated mass of fun and nonsense synonymous with these nearly identical yellow oval creatures, and successfully channels it into a pleasing movie shape.Minions, as you will know if you haven't recently awakened from a five-year coma, are the ill-defined, much-loved critters that enthusiastically serve the 'Despicable Me' franchise's Gru. Whenever things are getting a bit saccharine between the formerly dastardly Gru and his accidentally adopted girls, the Minions are there to spout gobbledygook, enact pratfalls, and generally lay on the comic relief. In fact 'Despicable Me 2' was funnier than its predecessor because it had 'more minions', so putting the sidekicks center-stage in order to ramp up the laughs further made sense. The conventional cartoon story arcs of self-realization and redemption are skipped, but any sacrifice in emotional resonance is compensated for by the pace and purity of the fun.A prelude traces the origins of the species as the yellow organisms evolve from silly, single-celled cheerleaders for nasty underwater predators to silly, jellybean-shaped cheerleaders for the T-Rex. Although the opening 'minions through history' sequence proves a very tough act to follow, this slice of burbling slapstick animation did keep me grinning and giggling throughout.By the time the 1960s roll around, the group is bored and without leadership. It falls upon heroic Minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob to journey across the globe to find an 'evil big boss' they can call their own. The plot follows our adorably unholy trinity from Antarctica to Orlando, where the 1968 Villain-Con unites them with Sandra Bullock's rocket-skirted Scarlet Overkill. Scarlet dreams of being the Queen of England, but a botched Tower of London heist leaves a young Queen Elizabeth II (Jennifer Saunders) in the pub and King Bob on the throne â albeit briefly. It's gloriously silly but still pop-culture- literate stuff, packed with dizzyingly frenetic action and fabulously expressive verbal gobbledygook; the latter largely courtesy of co-director Pierre Coffin.I started laughing the moment I heard the minions singing the Universal Studios' theme score in their helium-inflected tones, and remained tickled yellow for the following 90 minutes. There's something irresistibly comic about these adorably, amusingly devious little buggers' slapstick pratfalls, the macaronic gibberish they spout and, above all, their blithe bumbling innocence.",7,14,26,5 July 2015
Joy," Fighting Ahead and Finding Joy Despite Huge Odds
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsThe latest feature from writer-director David O. Russell is a quirky but very perceptive dramaedy made in Russell's usual freewheeling style. He looks at what it takes to make it, the American Dream, familial dysfunction and love in spite of that pervasive dysfunction, and the loneliness of a long-distance runner. 'Joy' is, for all intents and purposes, pure joy to look at and sit through, complete with postcard-worthy scenes, a mesmerizingly immersive script, fairytale like seamless direction from an in-form Russell (red-hot after delivering a trio of classics in 'The Fighter', 'Silver Linings Playbook', and 'American Hustle'), an all-star cast at the top of their game for most parts, and Jennifer Lawrence wearing the pants.Lawrence is the standout as always and she delivers a very believable performance in the eponymous role. David O. Russell has certainly found his muse. As Katharine Hepburn was to George Cukor or Marlene Dietrich was to Josef von Sternberg, so too is Jennifer Lawrence to Russell. This is his third picture to feature Lawrence but the first to star her - or any woman for that matter - as the sole lead in one of his movies. The partnership has yielded yet another fruitful collaboration for all involved. In an era where we routinely bemoan the dearth of strong roles for women, 'Joy' quietly enters the discussion and gives us exactly that.The film is a real tribute to the scrappy heroines of the 1940s when female-centric films were common. Think pictures starring Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Katharine Hepburn, or Joan Crawford. Yes, those are indeed lofty comparisons, but Jennifer Lawrence embodies the fierce spirit of those trailblazing heroines. What's old seems new again. She's an uplifting breath of fresh air. A woman with her eyes firmly set on the American Dream. I'll even go so far as to say that if Lawrence had been born before 1920, she might have stolen roles from Jean Arthur, Katharine Hepburn, or Bette Davis. This is a defining role where she comes in not aggressively 'with a bow and arrow', as the director has noted, 'but with her heart and soul'. 'Joy' will definitely please Jennifer Lawrence fans as well as viewers who enjoy movies with a strong female lead and viewpoint.",8,2,8,2 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Believe the Hype!
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 5/5 starsWith exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' brings George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life. The film delivers and delivers big time. There's no clearer or more succinct way to put it. 30 years after last appearing on the big screen, Mad Max roars back with a vengeance.Miller once again gears up for a post-apocalyptic action-thriller with 'Fury Road', the fourth outing in the 'Mad Max' film series. Set in the furthest reaches of our planet, in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, almost everyone is crazed fighting for the necessities of life such as water and fuel. Within this world exists two rebels on the run who just might be able to restore order. We are reintroduced to Max, still a man of action and few words who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. The second insurgent is Furiosa, also a woman of action and one who believes her path to survival and possible salvation may be achieved if she can take a handful of oppressed, tormented, incarcerated beautiful young women across the desert back to her childhood homeland. Max and Furiosa team up in the most unlikely of alliances - and for polar opposite reasons - to stand up to 'the man', get their hands dirty, and get the job done.'Fury Road' has visionary moments, speed, and a wild sense of daring. You stumble out of the theater giddy about what films (even action movies) can actually do when their set their mind to it, transported by the breathtaking velocity in this battering ram of a picture that just goes, goes, goes, and then keeps on going. Even after two viewings, I feel as though I've only scratched the surface of 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. George Miller's bleak, badass actioner is astonishingly dense for a big-budget spectacle, not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them.It also represents a certain kind of hope that's highly implausible to materialize - for as technology continues to improve and digital effects wizardry enhances exponentially, here's an old-school master that refreshingly gets to the basics and uses the powers at his disposal for good rather than to score an easy way out. The action is fast and furious and totally bonkers. And yet the style is totally in keeping with its predecessors while being innovative and boldly new: Old West showdowns meets funk mayhem meets feminist drama. Seriously! But the movie has so much more to do with the architecture of the frame and Miller's delight in throwing things right at the face of the audience than any sneaky feminism. There's a kind of kinetic genius to the movie, which is essentially one long chase, adrenaline-pumping chase sequence.We have to admit that Hollywood's franchise hunger has reached the point where any level of cynicism regarding a sequel, reboot, or re-imagining is defensible, and given that it had been 30 years since the last 'Mad Max' installment, one could be forgiven for approaching this Tom Hardy-led continuation of the saga with a somewhat jaundiced eye. But all that time away from the franchise clearly gave Director/co-writer George Miller plenty of ideas, because 'Fury Road' is that rarest of blockbuster beasts: an action- thriller that isn't content to merely string together set pieces. In fact, it's a surprisingly thoughtful film, one whose message is afforded equal importance alongside epic action sequences arranged with balletic, eye-popping grace. Amidst all this, Hardy's Max Rockatansky remains a man of few words - in fact, he spends a good deal of the film with a mask covering his mouth - but alongside co- star Charlize Theron, he grounds the movie's gonzo outbursts with palpable human emotion. Believe all the hype, and then believe it some more. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' will melt your face off, and then slam it back on.",10,2,14,5 July 2015
The Great Gatsby," Surprise! Surprise! A Baz Luhrman Film that's both, Well Shot and Astutely Crafted.
","Rating: 3.5/5 stars Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Besides being visually enchanting like most Baz Luhrman films, this is also one of his few offerings that's aesthetically beautiful, dramatically satisfying, characteristically emphatic, and sufficiently entertaining, as it is visually brilliant. The ensemble cast effortlessly coagulates any chinks in the multi-layered narrative. Most importantly, the movie resonates with one simple but true message: 'That nothing is too great or too small for love and if you really love, you should be willing to pay any price for it'. Come awards season, expect this movie to snag all the nominations for its intoxicating cinematography.",7,2,4,25 June 2013
13 Hours," Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi Review: Bay Can Direct and Direct He Does
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.7/5 stars'13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi' is Director Micahel Bay's most mature effort hitherto, and almost makes you forget his cinematic abominations in the past few years; almost, ranking with his best efforts like 'The Rock' and 'Armageddon'. Film schools will hardly declare it as a shining example of brilliant filmmaking, but all the tough SOBs in the Navy Seals, Delta Forces, and Marines - the ones whose opinions actually matter here because they're the ones who go through such harrowing experiences to keep us protected - will, in all probability, give '13 Hours' two thumbs up.The story of the by now well-known attack on the CIA base in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 generally sticks to what is thought to have happened, and provides some tense action scenes while paying due reverence to the sensitivity of its subject matter. But, then again, Bay's expertise in staging elaborate and exciting fight scenarios was never in doubt, it's been his handling of other directorial aspects that have made many of his efforts almost intolerable. Thankfully, this time we get the Bay of 'The Rock' rather than the man behind the misfires that were 'The Transformers' movies and his other mind-numbing crapfests.'13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers' of Benghazi is a gut-wrenching, tense, action-packed, yet emotionally draining war movie, and Bay can still direct if he sets his mind to it. Why doesn't he do it more often?",8,2,8,29 May 2016
Draft Day," A Triumphant Sports-Drama
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsA highly inspirational sports film in the truest sense. 'Draft Day' has all the archetypal characteristics of a good sports tale without resorting to the usual clichÃ©s plaguing such films. Well, it does have a few clichÃ©s such as the triumph of the underdog and the never-say-die attitude of the protagonist, but then again, is it possible for any sports film to leave an impact sans certain clichÃ©s. The sports-drama is one genre where filmmakers find it most difficult to steer clear of certain kinds of scenes and moments, but a good writer knows how to construct such scenes and a competent Director knows how to handle their narration, so that the audience is left with a distinctive presentation of something they've seen before. It's here where Director, Ivan Reitman, and writers, Scott Rothman and Rajiv Joseph, score big time, as they've shrewdly pruned many familiar, unavoidable scenes and presented them in a revamped manner. Sample this; when Costner is giving the all too familiar motivational speech â a staple in sports films â he doesn't do so before the climax, but during the climax itself; at the very end. And he delivers it with with some unique quips, witty dialogues, and some memorable one-liners thrown in for added measure. More importantly, the speech is as much for himself as it is for his coterie; something arguably never seen in a sports film before, and this is just one of many well-written, brilliantly-directed scenes of the movie.'Draft Day' tell a fictional tale of America's popular event, the 'NFL Draft' - now almost a part of the nation's folklore â and how it can change the lives of both young football prospects and also seasoned professionals â for better or for worse. Sonny Weaver, the general manager of the Cleveland Browns, has the opportunity to rebuild his team when he trades for the number one pick. He must decide what he's willing to sacrifice on a life-changing day for a few hundred young men with NFL dreams. Along the way he also has to settle issues in his personal life with his pregnant girlfriend, Ali Parker - a financial lawyer also working with the Browns â his mother, who's only wishes are her son's attention and his responsibility to fulfill his father's dying wish, and finally his own reconciliation with the unresolved problems he faced with his father. To know how all this culminates on one fateful night and results in life-changing repercussions for a number of individuals you'll have to see this immensely entertaining film.What elevates the drama, overall feel, and those familiar goosebumps we get from watching a great sports film are its performances, and 'Draft Day' boasts of a number of fine, crackling performances by a top-notch ensemble cast (the casting director deserves special credit for this). Led by the ever-dependable Kevin Costner â who's lost none of his effortless, infectious charm â the cast draws us right into proceedings and ensures that we care about the outcome of their story arcs. While Costner competently shoulders the weight of the film as its leading man, he's surrounded by an impressively talented assortment of supporting actors such as Chadwick Boseman (you literally feel for his hopes and emotions), Denis Leary, Wade Williams, and legendary actors like Frank Langella and Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn. Even Jennifer Garner is surprisingly good as Costner's love interest. The entire cast seems to feed of each other and the cracker-jack of a script handed to them to effectively bring out the Director's vision on screen.'Draft Day' is an exceptionally enjoyable film with immense repeat value. Though it's simply constructed and follows a by-the-numbers routine, it still takes a highly unconventional route for a sports film, as in all the drama happens off the field, and moreover, it packages itself as something fresh and revamped. The only other sports film that comes to mind, which took such an unconventional route yet triumphed was 'Moneyball'. 'Draft Day' is a treat for fans of American football, fans of sports-dramas, and just about anybody who loves inspirational movies.",8,2,3,27 August 2014
Furious 7," This is First-Rate Entertainment
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.6/5 starsServing up a fresh round of over-the-top thrills while adding unexpected dramatic heft, 'Furious 7' keeps the franchise moving in more ways than one. Continuing the global exploits in this unstoppable franchise built on speed; Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead the returning cast of this chapter directed by James Wan that also welcomes back favorites Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, along with Elsa Pataky and Lucas Black in special appearances. They are joined by international action stars new to the franchise including Jason Statham, Djimon Hounsou, Tony Jaa, Ronda Rousey, and Kurt Russell.This time around Dominic Torretto and his crew finally think they've left the criminal mercenary life behind after being granted full, government-sanctioned pardons for their hand in defeating international terrorist Owen Shaw. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw is out for vengeance, and orchestrates a series of attacks on the crew, resulting in the death of a key member, and leaving another gravely wounded. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde, and a shady government official called Mr. Nobody are both competing to steal a computer program called God's Eye, that can hack into any technological device around the world within mere seconds. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between terrorists and the United States government.'Furious 7' is, without a vestige of doubt, the best chapter in the franchise - no two ways about it. The production is all about raising the stakes to top the erstwhile entries, and boy does it succeed in doing so! Even though this installment is as zippy, playful, and amiably preposterous as the previous two models (the analogy with parts 5 and 6 are being made considering they were hitherto the best in the series), it still feels bigger, faster, funnier, and yes, more touching. The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant with the film boasting the craziest stunts, campiest dialogue, warmest of most warm fellowships of any entry yet. The sequels have grown progressively outrageous but they've shrewdly embraced a semi- comedic style, and this has only served to benefit the series - the way this gang cheats death in the Fast & Furious milieu is closer to the rules that govern cartoons like the 'Looney Toons' and 'Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner'. Kudos to Director James Wan (who now turns his sights towards action after earning his place as a horror auteur, and comes out with flying colors) and his stunt team for pulling out all the stops in their quest to deliver a complete package of no-holds- barred, gleefully outrageous action sequences that make the movie feel so transcendent and fantastically entertaining. Just when you think they've gone as far over-the-top as possible, they do a whole bunch of more unimaginable, crazy stuff.Anyway, these films were never meant to be emotionally deep or boast incredible acting and nuanced plot lines - and anyone expecting such things is either just plain inane or needs to acknowledge that the franchise isn't their cup of tea. That being said, 'Furious 7' ends up having some surprisingly touching subtexts concerning family - not necessarily people united by blood, but by loyalty and friendship. The camaraderie here is stronger than it has ever been. And though the performances aren't going to lay claim to any acting honors by any stretch of the imagination, it's the authentic chemistry of the entire cast, their wittily delivered one-liners, and the magnetic star appeal of the likes of Diesel and Johnson that lend melody to the film's relentless beat.Most importantly, 'Furious 7' could have easily come across as morbid and schmaltzy, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Paul Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect. An additional scene - obviously shot and juxtaposed after Walker's sad demise - before the end credits roll pays a fine tribute to Walker and his impact on the series, and more significantly his bond with the rest of the cast. If this is the final entry of the franchise, then it's a perfect ode not just to the series, but to the life of the late Paul Walker as well. By the end of it all, I challenge any regular follower of these movies to keep their tears at bay. Anyway, despite having a whale of a time, one does get the feeling that they should just stop now and leave on a high note, instead of ruining it all by overdoing a really good thing.Explosive, spellbinding, and surprisingly touching, 'Furious 7' is a fitting farewell to Paul Walker and probably to the franchise, too. Simply put, 'Furious 7' is one of the biggest, loudest, zaniest, and 'holy crap that was incredible!!!' action movies ever.",9,1,2,7 April 2015
