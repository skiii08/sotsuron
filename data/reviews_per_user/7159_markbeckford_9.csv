The Avengers," Best. Superhero. Movie. Ever.
","This is hands down the best super hero movie made to-date, and I've seen them all. At over 2 hours and 20 minutes, it is wholly captivating, perfectly balancing character development, team development (which is critical for this movie) and eye-popping 3D action. This is no small feat, bringing together the six 'heroes.'. Even the minor characters are brought to the forefront (Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, for example), enriching their characters and making their action sequences just as cool and dynamic.And surprisingly, it is the best Hulk movie. There are two scenes featuring the Hulk that will have you laughing so hard you'll be in tears. You'd think Iron Man would have the coolest action sequences, but when the Hulk inflicts carnage on the enemies, you don't want it to stop. This is Josh Whedon's breakout movie. No longer will he be known as 'the guy that made the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series,' but the guy that made The Avengers.",9,2,6,5 May 2012
This Is the End," Has Seth Rogen ever been in a bad movie?
","'This is the End' is a laugh riot. Has Seth Rogen ever been in a bad movie? His lowest rated movie per RottenTomatoes is 'The Watch' (16%), but I thought that was a pretty funny and entertaining movie. I think 'The Green Hornet' is the limpest of the bunch. If you are offended by that adjective, you definitely should NOT watch this movie as there are more male body/sex/potty jokes than I've seen in any other movie in my lifetime (and I am old enough to remember Porky's). At face value, it seems like it would be pretty hard to screw this movie up with Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Michael Cera and a dozen others playing themselves during the 'Apocalypse.' Even Rihanna and Harry Potter's Emma-freaking-Watson have extended cameos. There is one cameo that is so absurd and crazy that it would be a major spoiler to reveal it. Speaking of spoiler alerts, you'd think that the cause of the Apocalypse wouldn't be revealed, but that hasn't been the case with one reviewer mentioning that it as a literal interpretation of the Bible's Book of Revelations. You're at least 45 minutes into the movie before they reveal what is really happening (unless you are, or were, raised Catholic. Then you get it pretty early on). Yeah, it's also a riff on the egocentricity of Hollywood celebrities, but who really cares unless you are an avid reader of TMZ or Perez Hilton. The real brilliance is in the dialogue, a ton of which has to be ad-lib/improv. There are so many jokes in this movie told in the context of the story it would fill a TV comedy series for multiple seasons. This is a two-hour comedy movie. Do they make any comedy movie that long? I just hope it has a 'Lord of the Rings' style Extended Edition on DVD.",9,3,8,22 June 2013
World War Z," Brad Pitt helps keep the Zombie Apocalypse Genre fresh
","I originally had low expectations for this movie (even as a huge fan of the Walking Dead, I'm feeling 'zombie-fatigued'). But the idea that zombies are both fast and 'swarm' (like ants crawling on top of each other) to climb a huge wall is a unique twist that could make this movie fun to watch (written May 2013).And it ended up being a blast. It introduced an original story-line to the zombie-apocalypse genre. First, an origin to why the zombie plague started. Second, the potential for a cure? And lastly, Brad Pitt as the best dad/survivalist ever. If I had to pick my team to battle the zombie apocalypse, I'd want Brad on my team, no matter that he is 20 times more handsome than me. (written July 2013)Afternote: If you saw the movie, don't read the book. In this rare case, the book falls short of the movie. The book is told in 'documentary-style' based on memos etc. that recall the events 'after' World War Z. The movie tells it in real-time which is how it should be experienced.",8,1,2,12 September 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel is better than expectations (and what the movie critics think)
","I had low expectations going into 'Man of Steel' given the mediocre reviews (57% on RottenTomatoes) and Zack Snyder's track record that started to look a bit like M. Night Shyamalan's. After his break-out debut with the 'Dawn of the Dead' re-make and followed by the eye-popping '300,' he started to stumble with the mind-bending 'The Watchmen,' a cartoon movie about owls, and the disposable 'Sucker Punch.' But I was hopeful given the guiding hand of producer/screenwriter Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David S. Goyer. Man of Steel was a pleasant surprise that was vigorous and entertaining.Russell Crowe nearly resurrects his Gladiator greatness as Kal-El's/Clark's/Superman's reserved but bad-ass father on Krypton. The deeper dive into the chapter of Krypton's demise is absolutely captivating with the addition of a ton of science fiction elements. Instead of re-treading Superman's back-story on earth which has been covered abundantly already, the use of flashbacks between the adult and young Clark works really well. Henry Cavill as Superman does a decent job switching from brooding to giddy to serious, although when he's not in his suit his sculpted body looks totally unreal. Amy Adams as Lois Lane plays the part of a strong female lead well while putting the character, as always, in completely ridiculous situations requiring the classic save by Superman. Michael Shannon from HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire' is solid as the maniacal and ethnocentric General Zod. Unfortunately, the movie falls into tedium and redundancy during the 'smash-things' climax where Superman and Zod (and his minions) do 20-times more smashing and destruction than all of 'The Hulk' movies combined. The Avengers smash-things climax was even longer (I think) but 20-times more entertaining because they smashed things in very different ways. There is a limit to how many times you can watch invincible beings get hurled through buildings. Ultimately, even these flaws can't diminish a well-crafted reboot of the oldest super hero of all time. Zack Snyder may have just got his mojo back.",Null,1,2,15 June 2013
Gone Girl," David Fincher has a fetish
","David Fincher has a fetish for taking complex novels of suspense and intrigue and turning them into delightfully dark and twisted tales that make damn good cinema. He did it with Fight Club and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and he's now done it with Gone Girl, the 'it' novel of 2012. Ostensibly a simple story of a wife that vanishes mysteriously under suspicious circumstances, it expertly weaves parallel and divergent narratives through multiple twists and alternative time-lines while skewering the 'trial-by-the-media' culture and the real-life horrors of mid-life marriage angst.Ben Affleck is perfectly cast as Nick Dunne, the protagonist/antagonist husband of the missing wife. The book/movie works so well because Affleck's character is very hard to pin down. He's flawed but like-able, clueless but clever. Rosamund Pike is excellent but to reveal more would be a spoiler. Fincher even works magic with the minor characters. Who would have thought of Neil Patrick Harris as a creep-manipulative sad-sack stalker. Carry Coon, a standout in the HBO series The Leftovers, plays Nick's sister and the audience's voice of reason when you just want to scream 'Nick, you freaking idiot!' It's not always perfect. Affleck is obviously buffing up for his upcoming role as Batman with bulging shoulders/biceps that are juxtaposed in tight shirts with his character's slovenly 'pot- belly.' Another character goes from thin to over-weight in just a few days while trying to go incognito. It also seems to struggle to figure out how/when wrap things up.These are all 'nits' as the story churns in your head as the credits roll which is the true test of excellent film-making.",9,0,12,6 October 2014
Evil Dead," Best horror re-make since Dawn of the Dead in 2004.
","The new Evil Dead movie could be a litmus test for true fans of the horror genre. As Entertainment Weekly's review stated so well: the new Evil Dead is 'the bloodiest, goriest, slapstickiest horror movie since, well, The Evil Dead.'Horror fans would grin or laugh gleefully at most of the goriest scenes because a) most are truly unique and different than what we've scene before, and b) we've seen EVERYTHING before. Anybody else would shut their eyes, grimace, flee the theater, or just wouldn't go. And it's not that horror fans are gore junkies. Blood, gore and violence are irrelevant and tedious if it's not weaved into a captivating story with decent acting, great directing, and creative plotting. And that's exactly what the new Evil Dead delivers. Most die-hard horror aficionados know the original Evil Dead by heart. To re-do the first and deliver a new and different version while staying within the bounds of the original is no easy task. But Fede Alvarez in his directorial debut knocks it out of the park. It strikes that fine balance between reverence to the original (with both overt and subtle references) and newness/uniqueness to keep us captivated and excited (and excitement is key as most of us are definitely looking for a cerebral adrenaline rush). Just modernizing a classic with a bigger budget takes no creativity and falls into the tedium and redundancy which most horror fan's hate. Gus Van Sant's Psycho re-make, where nearly every scene is 'copied exactly,' is a perfect example of this. One word: BORING. The last, great horror re-make was 2004's 'Dawn of the Dead' which at the time was the best re-make since David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' in 1986. That's why us horror fans are rejoicing to have a new movie to re-watch 10 times until the next good one.",9,6,49,7 April 2013
Mama," Great until the big 'reveal'
","A creepy and mostly original ghost story. Jennifer Chastain is excellent as the goth and reluctant surrogate mother ... a nice change from the suburban mom that is more typical for these character types. The youngest actress who plays 'Lily' does a great job juxtaposing cute and creepy as the most screwed up 'wildling.' You can clearly see Guillermo Del Toro's influence given his obsession with bugs. There is too much use of 'The Grudge's' groaning sound effect -- someone needs to come up with a new and more original sound. When they eventually show 'Mama' in all her glory it starts looking a bit cheesy. But of the three similar titles put out in the last six months (Sinister, The Possession), this is the best of that lot.",7,0,1,7 April 2013
Prometheus," No-one does sci-fi horror better than Ridley Scott
","Ridley Scott had a bar that was set very high for this semi-prequel to Alien. Scott does not disappoint. The result was a sweeping epic with fantastic visuals and an unexpected homage to the sci-fi genre.For the discerning eye, there were scenes that were reminiscent of Star Wars, Star Trek, 2001 - A Space Odyssey, Aliens, X-Files, The Thing, and probably a few more I didn't catch. The very first scene was surprising and thought provoking, and the last scene was the closest connection to Alien the movie presented, beyond the iconic images already shown in the previews. A very long but never boring adventure, it showcased the great acting talents of Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish 'Dragon Tattoo' trilogy and Michael Fassbender, the best android of the Alien films. Charlene Theron continues to amaze as the best 'ice queen' in movies today. The film isn't perfect. It stretches the bounds of believability in several areas. Why do two of the 'scientists' freak out when seeing an 'alien' corpse but have no problem confronting the live 'thing' that would make most of us run for cover? Noomi Rapace has a scene that shows she can portray pain-in-action as good as Bruce Willis in Die Hard, but then has action sequences that suspend disbelief more than Willis running on tattered feet. You don't get the slow-paced, dread and suspense of the original Alien or Blade Runner. This has way more action, gore and crowd-pleasing scenes. But it is nonetheless a film that will become a most-see films for genre fans.",8,0,2,7 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," An entertaining, 'respectable' ending to an epic trilogy
","Rarely do I have as many mixed feelings and opinions after having seen The Dark Knight Rises. It felt epic. It was moving. It felt long. It worked well as a book-end to the trilogy. It felt forced.The performances were excellent. Anne Hathaway as Selena the Cat Woman. Joseph Gordon- Levitt as Blake, Michael Caine, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman and so on. The last 30 minutes were just fantastic, worth the previous two-plus hour wait. Better than the Batman Begins but fell short of Heath Ledger's Dark Knight (could that movie been as good without him?).Overall I think it suffered from being too grandiose by trying to do too much. The multiple acts didn't click together as they did in The Dark Knight. The suspension of disbelief was less 'suspended' than utterly confounded ... how did Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) go from emaciated cripple to muscle-bound butt-kicker in one day? And the finale, while enjoyable, had so many twists and conveniences it would have made my head spin if I wasn't enjoying it so much. To be fair, I think the best way to judge The Dark Knight Rises is as an attempt to close an epic story-line with a focus on continuity between the three films, reinforcing Nolan's conflicting 'hopeful nihilism' philosophy. I look forward to watching all three back-to-back to see his vision uninterrupted by tragic events and the passage of time.",7,2,7,7 April 2013
