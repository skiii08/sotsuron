The Avengers," Best Movie Of The Year
","Okay, what can I say that has not already been said. This movie is brilliant. It has everything. Action, great acting, a fantastic cast, mind blowing effects, humour, suspense, in short...everything. I had seen all the movies leading up to this. Hulk 2 Iron Man 1 and 2, Thor and Captain America. I knew The Avengers were going to be good, but this just blew me away. All the original actors were back in their roles except for Edward Norton, but Mark Ruffalo did a fine job. Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner Tom Hiddleston Clark Gregg Cobie Smulders Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson were all spot on. I loved the interaction between the various characters, the clash of egos, the tension. It was not just put there because the writers thought it would *move the plot along.* It was there because all of these guys have very specific personalities and at times they clashed. Samuel L Jackson was very much in charge, that man is perfect as Nick Fury, it's as if the role was created for him. The exchanges between Captain America and Tony Stark were amusing and at times downright clever. Chris Evens and Robert Downey Jr were perfect. None of the actors hit a wrong note but special kudos to Tom Hiddleston. As Loki he made the film what it was. He was the perfect antagonist. That smile of his was enough to chill, yet the scene between him and the Hulk had the entire theatre roar with laughter. I am not going to go into a real description here as many of the reviews already have but I will say this. The Avengers is one of the best comic book movies to date. It ranks up there with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, V For Vendetta and Watchmen. Thank you Joss Whedon for understanding the medium of comic books and having the vision to be able to bring The Avengers to life. I just hope we see more film like this in the future.",10,3,8,26 May 2012
Constantine," It's A Shame....
","It's a shame that the director and the producer did not sit down and actually read Dangerous Habits. It's a good story and it would have shown John Constantine's character as it is written in the Vertigo comic series, Hellblazer:John Constantine. The movie was quite good, but can someone please tell me why Keanu Reeves was cast to play a blonde haired Brit that actually looks like Sting? And why was a teenager cast to play the character Chaz when in the comics, he is a fifty odd year old grandfather? I liked the movie, but I hated the way the characters were Americanized. This is where I feel that the film let me and all the other Hellblazer fans down. I probably would have enjoyed it better if they had stuck closer to the original characters and stories.",7,1,3,12 August 2006
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," A Brilliant Film
","I have to say that out of all the musicals and rock opera, Hedwig and The Angry Inch is one of the best. First of all, the performances from all the cast is superb, the story is poignant and the music is just great. Hedwig him/herself is a fascinating figure, strong and confident, yet vulnerable and hurting. Yet she always has dignity. The story of how she escaped East Germany by becoming trans gendered and marrying an American Soldier only to have the operation botched and being dumped by her husband in favour of a young man is a sad one. The expression on Hedwig's face as she watches her husband leave then discovers that the Berlin Wall is being torn down, is almost heartbreaking. Yet Hedwig rallies around with what is probably the best song in the film, Wig In A Box. Hedwig's one hope is that she will find her other and that she will finally be whole and perhaps by the end of the film, she has. One final note, the character of Hedwig was actually inspired by a woman who used to babysit for the Mitchell family. She was a German divorced U.S. Army wife who was also a babysitter and moonlighted as a prostitute at her Junction City, Kansas trailer park home. This is a film for people that loved Tommy, The Rocky Horror Picture Show And Repo The Genetic Opera.",10,0,1,29 February 2012
The Dark Knight," Brilliant
","This is probably the best film that I have seen in a very long time. I have been a fan of Batman ever since I picked up my first comic book many decades ago. Seeing the various portrayals of the Caped Crusader have been interesting but none have enthralled me as much as Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. But the standout performance was Heath Ledger as The Joker. His portrayal of The Thin White Duke Of Death was astounding. To be quite honest, I did not think he had it in him but happily, I was wrong. Chris Nolan has outdone himself and has finally given the comic book fans a movie worthy of the genre. The movie itself was well written, brilliantly acted and the special effects were eye popping. It is about time that we were given intelligent films like this and we have Nolan, Bale, Oldman and Ledger to thank.",10,2,4,10 January 2011
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," One Of The Best Comic Book Films
","Okay, to begin with, I don't understand why everyone is hating on this film. Most of the critics have pounded it. A couple have gone back to watch it a second time and come away with a more favourable opinion. I have to confess that I am a major geek and I was so looking forward to this film. Finally, Superman and Batman together. YAY. What more could a geeky fan girl want. The movie is dark, but that seems to be the DC universe right now and that's fine with me. Gritty and dark works, especially for Batman. Remember the Nolan trilogy? But now a lot of people are complaining that it's too dark. But that is the way that the Batman universe always was. I am not counting the campy 60's TV series or the downright foolish comics during the height of the comic book code that neutered the stories down to ridiculous levels. The Nolan trilogy worked for me because that was the world that Batman was living in. Now what people have to understand that is DC and Marvel are different. That does not mean that one is better than the other, both are great along with their siblings Dark Horse IWD Boom etc. But they are different. So I am not going to compare DC with Marvel, I love them both but spending the better part of fifty years reading and collecting comics I know enough not to make that mistake. Now after getting all that out of the way, why the movie works.First of all, the grimness which is what seems to be a major thing and why Kevin Smith said it had no heart. Now I love Kevin Smith and I know that he knows comics but like many people, he is falling into the 'if Marvel characters can crack jokes and be tongue in cheek, then why can't Batman and Superman?'Because Batman and Superman aren't Deadpool, (which who the way a freaking loved, and a review will follow shortly)and they are not Ironman or any Marvel character. Batman is deeply flawed, he was traumatized as a child by the death of his parents. This was something that has haunted his all his life. This is not the guy that's going to be cracking one-liners.Superman is different to Batman as day is to night. Superman in this interpretation is just setting out on the whole hero thing. He is still finding his legs and living on a farm in Kansas didn't really prepare him all that well. This is not helped by his father who wants him to keep has head down and draw attention to himself. But Superman is doing the best he can. He wants to help people, he just hasn't got it quite right yet.Batman is driven by his inner demons and this particular take on his character is a rather frightening. This is a Batman that really doesn't mind bloodshed. Hell, he even brands the bad guys, YEESH. (Sorry but it is kinda Sin Cityish isn't it.)Both Cavill and Affleck are excellent in their roles, Affleck surprisingly so. I think that is one thing the Critics can agree on if nothing else. By the way, kudos to Jeremy Irons, best Alfred ever. Jesse Eisenberg was good as Lex Luthor but personally he would not have been my first choice. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was perfectNow to the movie itself. I loved it, but then I went in wanting to love it and I did. I know I am swimming upstream from so many people that hated it but the movie worked for me.Now that's not to say it was a perfect movie, it wasn't. The Doomsday arc in the storyline felt rushed and I think, took away from the conflict between Superman and Batman which I think could have been explored a bit more.The action was great and it didn't let up. The chemistry between Superman and Batman was great, from the time of their first introduction right to Superman taking the roof of the Batmobile off and God, wasn't that awesome. But I think Zack Snyder made a mistake by resolving the conflict to quickly. Once again it felt a little rushed.The fight against Doomsday was great though and Wonder Woman was in her element. That little smile as she picked herself up from the rubble and rushed into the fray again was terrific. You could see she was having a ball. It was also a joy to see a more hands on and somewhat snarky Alfred doing his thing. The hints about the Joker and Robin's fate were well done and I am hoping that future movies will expand on this. Especially wit Suicide Squad on it's way. (Looking forward to seeing Jared Leto's Joker)All up, I think that critics have been too harsh and I hope that people keep going and seeing Dawn Of Justice, it's not perfect but it's fun and leading towards bigger things. After all, catching a glimpse of Aquaman and the Flash was cool. Hmmm, wonder how they are going to put Green Lantern in there.",10,24,44,14 April 2016
Deadpool," Deadpool Is A Winner For Marvel
","I have to admit that I am a huge fan of Deadpool. After reading the comics and trades, I was excited when Marvel announced that they were finally going to make a Deadpool movie.I had liked Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern but when I found out that he was cast to play Wade Wilson, the merc with a mouth, I was one happy fangirl, and I have to say, he did not disappoint.Marvel had fun with this film, all the characters were perfectly cast. It was fun watching Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) interacting with Deadpool, trading snark for snark while Colossus (Stefan Kapičić as the voice of Colossus,) is trying in vain to appeal to Deadpool's (better, saner?) side without success. Ajax and Angel Dust (Ed Skrein and Gina Carano) were good strong villains but it was Leslie Uggams as Blind Al that really stole the movie.The rest of the supporting cast played their roles well and created a good strong background for the main cast.It was also nice to see that Marvel finally got Deadpool's character right for a change and I loved the fact that Deadpool's constantly breaking the fourth wall was included and a brief glimpse of Bob popped up to the delight of the audience.The movie was filled with chaotic images and kept up a frantic pace that suited the movie perfectly. The constant tongue-in-cheek references and humour kept the movie from becoming too dark.All in all, Deadpool was a winner and I am looking forward to the sequel.",10,2,7,26 November 2016
V for Vendetta," V For Vendetta
","Having read the graphic novel by Alan Moore, I was really looking forward to seeing V For Vendetta on the big screen. Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman were both excellent in their roles as V and Evey. I was particularly impressed with Hugo Weaving's performance, despite the wig and the mask, he managed to portray the pain and rage that was deep inside the character. It was a pity that the movie could not show more of the injustices and oppression that the people were suffering. The graphic novel really showed how bad things were in this dystopian future of England, but the movie seemed to just skim over this. What thrilled me though, was the letter from Valerie, I was hoping that the movie would do this justice and not just skim over it as unimportant. The scenes where Evey is reading this letter, inter cut with scenes of her torture, and flashbacks of Valerie's life were beautiful. All up, as flawed as it was, V For Vendetta was perfect",9,2,4,12 August 2006
