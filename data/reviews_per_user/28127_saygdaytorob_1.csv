Ford v Ferrari," Real driving, great acting
","I learned this has very little CGI. I was sure to watch this in a theatre with great sound. Man was I happy about the decision, a fantastic movie with great history to be learned. Even if you aren't a car but, this is a moving and at times funny story with amazing actors and scenes, extremely well put together. Question is, when can I go watch it again?",10,6,17,14 November 2019
