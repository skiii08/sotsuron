It," Run-of-the-mill horror with some resemblance to King's book.
","'IT' is a fairly well made horror movie, if you watch it with no high expectations or prior knowledge of the book. The cast and cinematography are above par for the genre, and there are some genuinely great moments. The opening scene really stands out; it does a great job of drawing us into the story and introducing us to Pennywise. And there is a bone chilling moment when the gang watches a slide projector go mad showing Pennywise truly come alive. It's a shame the second half of that scene is botched by an almost slapstick like manifestation of the clown cut mercifully short. That scene in the garage is a good example of why this movie isn't 'IT'. The book and miniseries weren't about cheap jump scares but about character development. The evil in the original story wasn't something scary jumping at you out of the closet; it was something more chilling and deliberate: waiting, and inevitable. That is why those kids went after it: they didn't want to, they didn't just up and decide 'let's kill that .... clown', they did it because they had to, despite their deepest fears. An incredible struggle for anyone let alone a bunch of kids, and something masterfully described in the book, yet the movie manages to completely miss this point.The second half of the movie feels hurried and sloppy, almost as if both writers and cast are eager to get to the final scene. Again a complete departure from King's careful pacing and attention to colour and detail. All in all, it's a decent horror, but it doesn't do the original any justice.",5,0,1,10 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A good script poorly executed.
","The good: Special effects are top notch! This movie delivers when it comes to excitement, and the storyline lives up to my expectations. There's a few very good 'movie moments' in this movie... the events following the issue of 'order 66' is bone-chilling.The bad: Editing! At times the action moves so fast and the camera jumps around so quickly that one loses track of what's going on. Also, the scenes jump around a lot. Cut to two persons who each get to deliver one line, and off we go again to the next scene light years away. This was bad in Eps 1 and 2, but this movie takes it to new levels. The result is that we never really get the chance to get to know the characters, or build any sort of affection for them (or loathing as the case may be). Unlike Eps. 4 to 6, I did not find myself caring for any of the characters in this installment. Also, the staggering amount of locations and different creatures gets a bit overwhelming at times.The ugly: Hayden Christensen's performance is very poor... 'wooden' does not even begin to describe it. At times when one would expect some genuine emotions to show, he delivers his lines in the same flat monotone.On the whole, a good, very entertaining movie that (I expect) will not disappoint both new and old Star Wars fans. A shame about the jumbled editing and Christensen's performance; more attention to those areas would have made for a great movie instead of a good one.",7,0,1,23 May 2005
