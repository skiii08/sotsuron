Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Dull and Predictable
","I rented 'Borat' influenced by all the positive reviews I had read on newspapers and websites. But, once again, much ado about nothing.In a nutshell, 'Borat' has the kind of 'politically incorrect' humor that is not for everyone. I have nothing against it... provided that it is elaborate and well prepared. 'Seinfeld' is an example of this, and it is my favorite sitcom. This is not the case. In Borat everything comes down to the unbearable stupidity of the protagonist, which leads him to saying wrong things at the wrong time. For instance, there is one scene in which Borat has a meeting with a group of feminists and he has no better idea than telling them that 'women should not be educated' and that they have 'smaller brains'.All the movie is like that: stupid and unimaginative remarks about women, Jews, homosexuals, gypsies and so on. Make yourself a favor: don't rent this movie.",1,3,9,7 February 2008
