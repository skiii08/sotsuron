Ford v Ferrari," Technically dazzling with a dull script
","Technically dazzling and well-acted film, but the script is a dull thud. Scenes are often contrived, sometimes exasperingly so, such as when Ken Miles (Christian Bale) explaiins the details of the Le Mans circuit to his son (Noah Jupe), or Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) demonstrates the need for a first-rate driver to Henry Ford II (excellent Tracy Letts). Come on, writers! Couldn't you do better than this?Very much a boy's adventure pic with a slight seasoning of 'vulnerable man' stuff thrown in as a sop to 21st century sensibilities. In the only female role of any consequence, Caitriona Balfe is strong and supportive, but, for all the difference her character makes to the story, she might just as well not be there.In the manner of all films about motor racing (e.g. GRAND PRIX, John Frankenheimer's 1966 movie), the race footage is what it's all about, and some of FORD v FERRARI's is genuinely thrilling. The story that surrounds it, interesting though it is, inevitably seems tame by comparison.",4,47,148,30 October 2019
The Lobster," a treat
","This is a dark satire, set not so much in the future but in a kind of parallel present, in which being single is outlawed. Without a partner, you're either pray for hunters, or you have a chance to hook up with someone in a kind of institutional hotel. If you fail, you get taken to a transformation room, where you're turned into an animal.The film maintains a deadpan tone throughout, in vibrant contrast to the horrible deeds perpetrated by and upon the characters. The cast, led by Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux and Olivia Colman, enact scene after outrageous scene with straight faces. Goodness knows how they did it.It's merciless, often very funny, and as far as English-language movies are concerned there's really nothing like it that I'm aware of. A treat.",9,0,2,5 January 2017
Spartacus," find something better to do
","If 'epic' equates with 'tedium' then this is indeed a classic of the genre. Every so often there's a shot that reminds you that Kubrick was involved - for example, a breathtaking long shot against an amazing sky in which Spartacus carries his wife on horseback from one side of the screen to the other across the ridge of a hill - but most of the time the entire enterprise is wallowing in an over-emotionalism that renders it mostly difficult and usually impossible for the audience - well, this audience, at least - to feel anything at all. The very guilty party is Kirk Douglas. There is a scene towards the end of the film when he is addressing his slave army, and the scene alternates with Olivier addressing Rome: the difference in quality is palpable. Poor old Douglas doesn't have a hope, he is so greatly outclassed. Now, I have seen Douglas be very good indeed: he is excellent in Wilder's 'Ace in the Hole', to name just one of his movies, so I'm not an unqualified loather of his work. It's just that here, where he was apparently producer as well as star, we have a film that was made according to his taste, and his taste is lousy. There are good moments, but he's rarely in them: they feature Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov and Lom. The wonderful Jean Simmons copes pretty well with her poorly-written part. The early fight sequences in the gladiator training camp are good too, and promised better things to come, a promise sadly unfulfilled. As we discovered in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, too many battle scenes make for emotional numbness. Which brings me to Alex North's score, to which the same applies: there's just too much of it, and so much of it the same. The epic movie as a genre is, I'll admit, something I find very hard to take. It generally requires you to believe in unflawed heroism, which I find an uncomfortable, nigh-on dangerous idea. In the case of Spartacus, this is somewhat redeemed by the film's reaching for a tragic ending, and it is here that Douglas' performance begins, far too late, to turn into something to which one can relate. In his climactic fight with Curtis (a star actor strangely wasted in this film) the impossibility of Spartacus' position gives the actor something to chew on other than the scenery, and the outcome is the kind of emotion sadly lacking elsewhere. The same is I don't think quite true of the final scene between Douglas and Simmons: 'The Life of Brian' has perhaps intervened too powerfully for such a scene ever to be truly poignant again. But Simmons and Douglas try very hard to make it happen. Unsurprisingly, it's when the intervention comes of Ustinov's all-too-human, hitherto comic character that the scene starts to mean something. If you can spare the hours of your life to watch this kind of thing, then fine. But having sat through it myself now, I honestly think you'd be better off walking in the park.",3,22,43,25 January 2007
In Bruges," Hilarious
","Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) in this movie might be seen as a mordant response to the Tarantino's pairing of Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson)in PULP FICTION. Two mismatched hoodlums, more emotionally attached to each other than they initially suspect.The story of IN BRUGES becomes more surreal as it moves to its climax, a progression that for me doesn't quite come off - perhaps it needed more swirling mists and arty camera work a little earlier than the writer/director opted for. But this slight misjudgment doesn't ultimately detract from a hilarious script and excellent performances.Special mention to Carter Burwell: another superb score.",7,0,3,21 August 2013
Rocketman," Not bad
","A work of efficient legacy image-management by Sir Elton and his team. It's quite funny in places, visually impressive in others (the costumes are a real treat), harmlessly enjoyable on the whole. It's like watching an unusually raunchy school pageant, basically innocent but with a lot of knowing references to that naughty world of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll beyond -- or maybe on -- the sports fields.Taron Egerton is a good, perhaps very good, character actor in the making. He has a certain hidden quality that makes him intriguing. He doesn't have the charisma of a Brad Pitt or a Leonardo de Caprio, or the young Johhny Depp. Using his acting chops, he successfully recreates Elton the performer. He doesn't communicate the depths of despair that we're shown the great man going through, though. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the problem is the glib psychobabble of these scenes that are the weak points of Lee Hall's otherwise nicely-wrought script. Acting support varies from the excellent (Jamie Bell, Gemma Jones) to the inexplicable (Bryce Dallas Howard).The film is a juke-box musical, drawing on Sir Elton's extensive back catalogue to slot in to appropriate on-screen situations. Mostly these are easy fits (Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting, for example), some more oblique. The most successful is the title number, which is realised in an entirely unexpected, totally effective way. Kudos to all concerned.I have no doubt this movie, like Bohemian Rhapsody before it, will make a several mountains of money. It's not a bad film. On the whole it's an entertaining film. Credit to director Dexter Fletcher and his team for that. For me, this attempt to be mega-popular is always going to mean punches are pulled, that the unhappiness is never going to be particularly intense, while the highs are only tolerably high. On the other hand, the movie embraces Elton's gayness, working it through from a secret to a point of pride. That's excellent.",6,3,7,22 May 2019
The Death of Stalin," Ensemble
","What makes this film special is its outstanding ensemble of character actors. The committee room scenes in particular are a riot of jockeying for position, snide remarks and politicking of the highest, or should that be lowest, order. Performers of this calibre could bring even the dullest script to life, but it so happens they have excellent material to work with here, and they rise to it like the thoroughbreds they are.British theatregoers will be familiar with names that are probably not at all known elsewhere: Dermot Crowley, Paul Chahidi and Karl Johnson are hugely respected in the UK for their distinguished careers on stage. Topping the lot is Simon Russell Beale, the current king of British classical acting, at last finding a film role that gives him an opportunity to show what he can do. He and Steve Buscemi are the central antagonists in THE DEATH OF STALIN, and it is a joy to watch them at each other's throats.Michael Palin, Jeffrey Tambor, Jason Isaacs, Andrea Riseborough, Rupert Friend, Paddy Considine, Tom Brooke...We are truly spoilt.",8,60,98,26 October 2017
I'm Not There," something different (at last)
","Biopic: the word makes me shudder. I guess it makes Todd Haynes do something similar, or otherwise he wouldn't have come up with this fascinating movie inspired by the life and work of Bob Dylan. Essentially a film-maker's imaginative response to the man and the songs, it is something of a cinematic equivalent to Don Maclean's song American Pie, in which a whole era is celebrated and lamented in a lyrical, sometimes densely coded, piece of writing. Whether I'm Not There will last as long as American Pie (the song, not the movie of the same name!) only time will tell. But I'm pretty sure that when cultural historians look back and view the usual sentimental dross claiming to document the life of this or that artist, I'm Not There will shine out, a beacon in a dark sea of mediocrity. While it is true that not all of this film works, most of it is beautiful and absorbing and, in the case of Cate Blanchett, dazzling.As well as the excellent sextet of Dylans, there's poignant support from Charlotte Gainsbourgh, and contrastingly from Bruce Greenwood giving another of his splendid vipers.All power to Todd Haynes. The man, like his subject, is a poet.",8,1,4,29 December 2007
Passengers," doesn't fulfil its promise
","The first half of this movie is excellent. It takes its time to place its co-protagonist Jim Preston at a point where he has to make a fascinating choice, and then plays through the consequences of that choice on his relationship with sister-protagonist Aurora Lane. The roles are played by two perfectly-cast actors, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, whose enjoyment in each others charms and talents is a delight to watch. They are joined by Michael Sheen for a number of gently comic scenes set in a bar that comes straight out of Kubrick's THE SHINING. Gradually the references to other movies start to accumulate. 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, ALIEN, SILENT RUNNING and GRAVITY all make appearances. By the time it's done, the screenplay has lost whatever originality it had and turned into yet another piece of Hollywood sci-fi hackwork. What a pity.That aside, I was pleasantly surprised by Chris Pratt's range as an actor, as demonstrated in the first act of this movie. I hope he gets another chance to show the extent of his acting skills in a film that doesn't peter out.",5,6,13,5 January 2017
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Awful, in spite of the cast
","The overwhelming experience of this tedious drivel is of having dined out on a meal of caster sugar and saccharine. But what a cast! How to make sense of these first-rate actors - Moore, Carell, Gosling, Tomei and the rest - agreeing to lend their talents to this sort of teeth-grindingly irritating dross? It can't be just for the money.Did Julianne Moore think it was perhaps another THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT? Did it remind Steve Carell of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE? Please tell me Ryan Gosling didn't consider it on a par with LARS AND THE REAL GIRL. Believe me, this movie, so formulaic it's almost geometric, is not in the same class as those three. The only comparable idiocy I've seen in the past decade that sinks to this level is the Jennifer Aniston/Vince Vaughn vehicle THE BREAK-UP.OK, OK, enough venom. I just need to avoid this kind of movie. Maybe you'll like it. For the sake of your cinematic health, though, I hope not.",Null,0,2,31 December 2014
Knives Out," Entertaining
","A fun movie. I suspect writer/director Rian Johnson of attempting to sneak in a political message, but if so it is completely drowned out by the noise of merrily preposterous whodunnitry.Daniel Craig is a very good actor, so he gets away with being miscast as a Deep-South detective. Everybody else is effortlessly perfect, but it's really Ana de Armas' movie. She's excellent as the nurse to an uber-successful author (Christopher Plummer) whose family assembles for a get-together which was never going to turn out well. Ms de Armas' endearing rabbit-in-the-headlights quality belies a brilliantly controlled performance.Lots of delights elsewhere. Great to see Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Don Johnson enjoying themselves so much. Interesting to see Chris Evans out of his Captain America uniform. K Callan has very few lines but reliably steals every scene she's in. And there's Frank Oz, delightfully deadpan, plus a cameo from the mighty M Emmet Walsh.It's designed, filmed and edited with enthusiasm. Nothing to dislike, really. Undemanding entertainment.",7,8,26,23 November 2019
The Irishman," The real thing
","This is a dark movie, so perhaps it shouldn't be such a pleasure to watch, but it really is a joy to be guided once more through those mean streets by Martin Scorsese and his A-team, de Niro, Pacino and Pesci. Yes, we've been here before. And yes, the women's roles are underdeveloped, albeit brilliantly acted. But that's the milieu Scorsese and his excellent screenwriter Steve Zaillian are investigating. The depth and the quality of every element is evident in every moment of this long film, which held me enthralled throughout. It is such a relief to return to this level of artistry in an age of facile blood-and-guts merchants like Tarantino. THE IRISHMAN is the real thing. And there's a bonus in a small but perfectly executed, effortlessly threatening cameo from Harvey Keitel. Unmissable.",9,6,15,23 October 2019
Hot Fuzz," enormous fun
","What is particularly clever about this excellent movie is that it brings two genres together with such skill that if you are unread in one, you can still enjoy the other. The genres are 1) the tough city cop (Dirty Harry, etc), and 2) the Agatha Christie death-in-a-quiet-English-village. I know almost nothing about the former, but I've seen loads of the latter, and still loved Hot Fuzz - so people who know the tough-cop movies will have got all the jokes I missed, adding to their enjoyment.Superb script, full of laughs but also endearing observation. The central performances by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are terrific, particularly Pegg's, who shows a really wide range here: if it weren't couched in a parodic comedy, his performance might well be recognised as award-worthy.For an UK audience there is much delight in watching some wonderful character actors at work, led by Jim Broadbent, Billie Whitelaw and Anne Reid, their ranks joined by former dashing leading men Edward Woodward and Timothy Dalton, who are both excellent, especially Dalton, parodying his most famous role, which makes it all the funnier. There is also terrific double-act support from Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall.Enormous fun.",7,1,3,24 February 2007
Brokeback Mountain," a cinematic milestone
","This is a beautiful film. It is full of passion. It is based on a punch-packing short-story which I read a couple of years ago. When I heard who had been cast in the movie version I was sceptical. I shouldn't have been. It staggers me that the members of this young cast have found in themselves the depths of pain that they show. The final scene between Jack and Ennis is heartbreaking. The scenes between Jack's parents (Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie - both superb) and Ennis are devastating. And the scene where Ennis finds what he thought he had lost moves the whole event into the realm of tragedy. Tears are the only option. Heath Ledger is given the difficult task of leading us through this agonising final section, and he delivers in a way that I just can't imagine any other actor of his generation coming anywhere near. Astonishing, unforgettable. Both he and Jake Gyllenhaal seem to be completely unafraid of finding these extremes of love and rage, tenderness and desperation, in themselves. The screenplay is excellent, overcoming every difficulty in the adaptation with skill and sensitivity - it must be one of the most faithful screen adaptations of a work of fiction ever made. The photography is as breathtaking as the scenery it captures. The use of music is exemplary - I can't think of a contemporary movie that deploys its score so tactfully. The whole project has been handled with sensitivity and compassion. It's a great work of art. It's a cinematic milestone. It will stay with me forever. My awed congratulations to all concerned, especially Annie Proulx - wherever did she get this idea?! - and the magnificent Ang Lee.Postcript, 22nd January 2008: RIP, Heath Ledger. Sad, sad news.",10,35,42,9 January 2006
Concussion," 'It is offensive. I am offended'
","There has been quite a spate of movies recently boasting of being based on events that really took place. Up comes the sentence during the opening credits: 'Based on a true story.' Spotlight, Black Mass, The Big Short, Suffragette...Just when you think the movie is over, writing appears (usually white on a black background) telling the audience what happened to the characters or the next stages in the historical events depicted. Drives me crazy. If it matters so much that there's a need to tell you what happened next, it should be in the movie. If it doesn't matter, there's no need to tell us about it.Concussion follows this trend. But that's far from the only problem with it. It's a pedestrian piece that doesn't do anything like justice to its fascinating and important story. In spite of the best efforts of Will Smith and the authoritative presence of the ever-welcome Albert Brooks, the result is feeble. The movie attempts standard Hollywood emotional manipulation but it fails even in this, due in the main to poor pacing and inept shaping of the screenplay. Someone, someday, might make a very good movie about the way the NFL concealed vital information about the dangers to its players of head injuries. I certainly hope this flaccid attempt is not going to be the last word on the subject.",2,19,37,12 January 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," cardboard
","The genre doesn't get any less silly as the years go by, that's for sure. This is as bogglingly incredible as POSEIDON ADVENTURE or TOWERING INFERNO or JURASSIC PARK or the director's own INDEPENDENCE DAY. Obviously there's no point in going to any of these movies for insights into human relationships, but Emmerich's work in this respect is more embarrassing than most. There's more characterisation in HALLOWEEN than there is in this movie. This is weird, since there are some very good actors on show. They all but one sink without trace not because of the dominance of special effects but because the parts they are playing are just sooooooo corny. Somehow, Ian Holm manages to keep his head above the rising waters. Maybe a film with amazing special effects has to trade in cardboard cut-outs, but I'm sure that LORD OF THE RINGS managed to avoid it a lot of the time, especially with Gollum. There's nothing remotely resembling the power of that character here. Emmerich is not in Peter Jackson's league, or anywhere near it. There's nothing as scary as Spielberg's T-Rex from JURASSIC PARK. There's nothing very much at all, I'm afraid. Get someone to wake you when NYC gets into cold water, and then go back to sleep again.",1,2,5,5 June 2004
Match Point," little point
","Unwillingly, I join the swelling ranks of disappointed Woody Allen fans. There are big problems with the screenplay (a kind of watered-down version of Crimes and Misdemeanours) and the burden imposed on a leading man who, charming and talented though he may be, simply isn't up to doing what is asked of him - i.e. imbuing a two-D character with flesh and blood. The leading lady, on the other hand, with a little more to chew on, is as impressive as ever, as are a gallery of excellent English character actors - as long as Penelope Wilton and Margaret Tyzack are on screen, the outlook can never be entirely bleak. I saw this the night before I saw Brokeback Mountain, which blew me away, and in retrospect has me thinking that maybe Woody Allen should retire before he embarrasses himself further.",2,5,12,10 January 2006
Youth," Masterly
","This is the work of a master, a unique voice in world cinema. Whether it's as magnificent an achievement as his previous feature, The Great Beauty, time will tell. When dealing with film-making on this level the increments of mastery are so close together they can be safely ignored.Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, Rachel Weisz and Paul Dano head the cast. All are superb, with Caine in particular excelling - it's not at all surprising that he has won the European Film Award for best actor. May it be one of many such accolades for this performance.What is perhaps particularly astonishing about Youth is its immense sympathy for those who are twice the age of its director/writer. His compassion is clear in every frame of his movie. As an old guy myself, I'm grateful for that.",10,7,14,14 December 2015
Zodiac," unresolved
","This is a movie based on a book about a series of crimes for which the perpetrator was never brought to justice. A cartoonist on a regional newspaper becomes obsessed with the case, to the detriment of aspects of his domestic life. Nothing is resolved. No easy answers.This is an interesting attempt by Fincher and his team to do something a little different in terms of mainstream thriller fare. And, episode by episode, the story is well-told and superbly acted - some of the very best of Hollywood's character actors are on hand, led by the perpetually excellent Jake Gyllenhaal.The trouble is, if nothing is resolved for the story's characters, then nothing is going to be resolved for the audience. Whether you think it's a good thing to be left with the same feeling of frustration as the protagonists will determine your enjoyment. Personally, I'm not sympathetic to works of art that point out, however tactfully, that they are fiction while at the same time doing everything possible to present 'real life' on screen - no one in ZODIAC looks at the camera and says 'Hey you out there, it's only a movie!' I only wish they had. It might have lifted the air of portentousness that hovers over too much of this project.",5,1,3,14 June 2007
The Prestige," fun - but not quite satisfying
","An enjoyable movie which will wile away your time pleasantly in the company of some excellent actors, principally Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale - the latter surely one of the most interesting, intense and unpredictable actors working in movies today. They are expertly supported by the one and only Michael Caine, with a couple of delectable cameos from Andy Serkis and David Bowie.The women's roles, though well-performed, are under-written and fundamentally unengaging. This is a regrettable flaw, but there is a greater one - a trap which the authors were clearly perfectly aware of, but didn't seem to be able to avoid.The trouble with movies which have Great Revelations in them, as the story of this one goes to great pains to point out with regard to magic tricks, is that there is an inevitable disappointment once you know the answers. Given that the Nolans knew this to be the case, one might have hoped for some chasm of mystery left open. But it's all pretty much rounded off in the manner of an old-fashioned whodunnit. One can almost hear the writers' glee as they tied up another loose end, and then planted the trail that leads to it somewhere unexpected. The last time I felt anything so self-conscious was in The Last of Sheila, many years ago. What stops this from being as brittle as that film is the warmth of Bale, Jackman and Caine. Even so, for some reason the writers' minds somehow tick away audibly in what I'm sorry to say seems to me a too-clever-by-half kind of way.Whatever my complaints, this is a very fine confection, full of clever tricks, and a pleasant way to fill a couple of hours. My feeling is that the Nolans wanted to achieve something more than that. Unfortunately, they haven't succeeded.",7,0,1,8 November 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," ambitious
","This is an ambitious movie. It yokes together two completely contrasting methods of story-telling, two totally different atmospheres. One is a very violent portrayal of a local battle between the two sides of the Spanish Civil War; the other is the imaginative response of a young girl to those same horrors, as she seeks not only refuge but also some kind of explanation in fantastic tales, in which she is cast in the principal role.The trouble is that the political/historical story is also, of course, a fiction, no matter how typical or based on real events it may or may not be. In its own way it is as much a tale as the dazzling fantasy that the director puts before us. Nevertheless we are invited to look upon the historical plot somewhat differently - not least because 'real'characters often remind the young girl that she spends far too much time in the realm of childish stories, and that she should grow up and see the world as it is. The means by which this real Spain is conveyed to the audience is by a violence so spectacularly nasty that, hardened movie goer though I am, I could barely look at some of it. And yet in at least one of the fantasy sequences there is a grizzly horror that is also hard to look at. So there is a blurring, either deliberate or accidental - perhaps the fantasy world can be seen as the projection of the violence the young girl senses at first but then is increasingly part of. There is certainly a blurring of distinctions between the two worlds.This blurring is emphasised by two decisions. One is the portrayal of the principal male character, the fascist captain, as a vicious sadist, as immoral a villain as the giants or wolves of traditional fairy-tales,The other decision is the portrayal of his main antagonist, a brave freedom fighter, as his moral polar opposite, and who triumphs by means of a deus ex machina that seems quite as bizarre as Glinda the Good Witch turning up. And yet this world is supposed to be a real? Maybe the writer/director is making a point about what civil war is like. Maybe it's based on a real event that actually occurred: well, real events don't necessarily make good, believable fiction. Whatever the motivation for it, in the final analysis this blurring between the two stories weakens the story of the partisans. It makes them not quite believable, and therefore, for me, robs the daring end of the film of some power.All that said, the movie is amazing to look at, is very well acted, and, providing you've got the stomach for the more vicious stuff, worth seeing. It's definitely worth supporting a film like this that aims high, even if it doesn't quite get there.",7,4,9,9 December 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," missing ingredients
","Stephen Sondheim's stage work has not, with one significant exception, fared well when transfered to the cinema. The exception is, of course, West Side Story, for which he is credited solely as lyricist. Gypsy, his other significant lyrics-only credit, is a magnificent show which became a mystifyingly mediocre movie. Whatever cinematic virtues Richard Lester's version of A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum may have, it wasn't well received. And the movie of A Little Night Music disappeared, almost without trace, in spite of the presence in the cast of Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Rigg. As a composer-lyricist, Sondheim's most successful Hollywood outing has not occurred in an adaptation of a stage work, but as the songwriter for Warren Beatty's movie Dick Tracy, his contributions to which won him an Oscar.Given the above, Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is probably going to be the movie-going public's abiding view of Sondheim's oeuvre. In this respect, even with substantial cuts to the stage show's score, it serves the songs well. The original orchestrator and musical director were on hand to provide their considerable combined expertise, and in a big cinema with a state-of-the-art sound system, it's a terrific aural experience. At least as far as the instruments are concerned...Vocally, it's another matter. I've heard people sneer at Johnny Depp's sound, but personally I think it's pretty good. For what Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall have to do, they get away with it, whereas Sacha Baron Cohen is splendid, as are Jayne Wisener, Jamie Campbell Bower, wonderfully bouncy Ed Sanders, and, in a sadly reduced role, Laura Michelle Kelly. Helena Bonham Carter is, unfortunately, little short of a disaster on this front: although she sings in time and mostly in tune, the sound is dreary and lacking energy.In fact, the main weakness in the movie for me is that Mrs Lovett is played so listlessly. I can kind of see where this might have come from: the woman is worn out keeping her business going etc etc. But her songs are full of life. Tim Burton can evidently feel the exuberance in the greatest of them, The Worst Pies In London. The camera-work and the film editing are very sprightly during it. But Bonham Carter's wispy tone undermines the comedy.Bonham Carter is not by any means a bad actress: her scenes with Ed Sanders are grounded and real, and she successfully conveys, in the midst of all the gore, Mrs Lovett's adoration of Sweeney Todd. But she is, essentially, and unfortunately, miscast.On the other hand, the romantic couple, on stage generally too old (and mostly deadly dull), benefit here from appropriate casting, generous close-ups, and the tightening up of their story (at one point inexplicably: when Anthony Hope comes bounding in to tell Mr Todd of his discovery of Joanna, we have no sense of how Anthony knows where to find Todd, since we haven't seen them re-bond since they went their ways at the start of the movie, Todd giving Anthony only the vaguest idea of his future whereabouts). Todd himself is the real centre of the movie that bears his name, which is also a welcome shift from what happens in the theatre. On stage, the sheer energy of Mrs Lovett's material works to favour her. It is no accident that while she has been successfully portrayed by a number of first-rate actresses, only journeyman George Hearn came near to making Todd his own. Johnny Depp has now stamped his indelible mark on the role. He is, as we all know, a fine actor. Although here he doesn't actually appear to have to stretch his acting muscles unduly, he is such a star presence that any film he's in will revolve effortlessly around him. The Burton/Depp partnership has given us at least two dazzlers - Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. Sweeney Todd is not in that category, but an interesting lesser work. In my view, the stage show is simply a piece of fun with Grand Guignol conventions. Its apparent dourness may stem from the political gloss on the Todd story in the play version by Chris Bond, which Sondheim took as his source material. Although Bond's play is anything but solemn, the sombreness of Sondheim's music undoubtedly darkened its tone, which has made mining the rich humour in it rather more difficult. The fact is that Sweeney Todd is not a work that requires much dwelling upon. Attempts to burden it with significance merely serve to show up its simple basis as an entertainment. It has been taken up by opera houses, where the fun has been duly taken out of it, and its musical limitations mercilessly exposed.Tim Burton goes some way to reinstating the dark humour of the piece with his nimble camera. I can certainly see why the material would appeal to him. It's the Burtonland of Nightmare Before Christmas, The Corpse Bride, and even Mars Attacks. Whether Sondheim aficionados will be delighted, I somehow doubt. Never mind: they can always go back to the video of the stage show, which features the great Angela Lansbury in one of her showpiece roles, giving some insight into what is missing here.",5,4,6,29 January 2008
Nacho Libre," mostly funny movie
","In spite of some unappealing ingredients - what the real Mexicans made of Jack Black's accent I can't imagine - I found this an endearing, often amusing, pleasantly unsentimental and occasionally extremely funny movie. Black plays a junior monk in the orphanage in which his character himself was brought up, longing to make it big as a wrestler. The whole thing is as preposterous as a Roland Emmerich movie, but here there are also a lot of laughs, interspersed with some wince-inducing wrestling scenes, which won't be to everyone's taste, but which I nonetheless enjoyed.The cast play it straight to good effect, with Hector Jiminez contributing a particularly hilarious turn as the hero's sidekick. I suppose the politically correct ought to be advised to steer clear, but I'd rather they developed a sense of humour and went along, if nothing else for the costumes, which are very, very funny. Take in lots of popcorn.",6,0,1,12 August 2006
Capote," pointless
","In this film, we're invited to observe the descent into a moral and emotional funk of someone who isn't likable to start with. What was the point of making the film, then? To show that it would have been better not to have had IN COLD BLOOD - a book I admire, incidentally - in order to have kept our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. He behaves at the party at the start of the film exactly in the same way he behaves after his triumphant reading from the book, so his degradation is a matter of degree. Are we supposed to care enough about Capote to take seriously his claim that he and murderer Perry Smith are kindred spirits, with the former having had all the breaks while the latter had none? Mr Capote's plight didn't touch me at all, I'm afraid, so if that was the central idea it was wasted on me. But even if I could fathom why the filmmakers visited this pointless project on us, the clunky storytelling would still have bored me as it did. Hoffman gives a bravura performance to no emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I was yearning for more of them. Dreary beyond belief.",2,5,8,1 March 2006
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Loss and revenge
","Outstanding work by writer/director Martin McDonagh, in a return to form after the off-kilter 'Seven Psychopaths.' This is a film about the joint cul-de-sacs of loss and revenge. It is both horrifying and touching, and it is also very funny.McDonagh, a first-rate playwright, knows how to structure scenes and write dialogue. To do him justice, first-rate actors are required. They must love the succulent stew of characters he cooks up, because he catches the very best. I can't find enough superlatives for Frances McDormand and Sam Rockwell. They are, here as in everything they've ever been in, great. They are ably supported by Woody Harrelson, Caleb Landry Jones, Clarke Peters, Sandy Martin, Lucas Hedges, John Hawkes, Amanda Warren. The only weak link in this superb ensemble is Abbie Cornish, who is warm and smiley but is unfortunately out of her depth: a very odd piece of casting.Cinematography, production design, costume, editing, music - they're all top of the range. But in the end it's down to McDormand and Rockwell, and the brilliant script.",9,12,27,31 October 2017
The Devil Wears Prada," drivel
","It's enjoyable to watch high-calibre performers strut their stuff. The calibre of Ms Streep and Mr Tucci is very high. So far so good. They are presented to us here in a world of which we are invited to disapprove. But how can we disapprove of it when it is inhabited by such entertaining star turns? We can only love their world because we love them, and the excellently eccentric young Emily Blunt. We like, but we are less interested in, the pleasant, friendly Ms Hathaway. But her choices are the ones we're supposed to empathise with. We watch her make the approved moral choice. We might even think we would do the same. But the people we enjoy (Streep, Tucci, Blunt) are those whose moral choices are entirely questionable. So at the heart of this movie is a paradox. Or, to put it another way, a cynical lie. Who can blame Streep and Tucci for wanting to be associated with this junk? The parts are good. They play them well. But the fact is that this movie stinks. Give me the Farrelly Brothers any day - at least their drivel smells good.",2,7,13,22 January 2008
Fargo," wonderful
","One of the highlights of American 1990s cinema, FARGO has a lean, often violent, but mostly hilarious script, as dazzling as the snow which fills so many of the movie's frames.Cosy in bed with husband Norm (what a perfect name!), with baby on the way, everything is as it should be for our investigator Marge, unforgettably played by Frances McDormand. Then the phone rings. If it isn't a brutal crime, it's a crazy guy she used to be at school with. Marge finds it all incomprehensible. But out she goes, with seemingly effortless courage, trying to level the world out when it goes off kilter.There are many echoes of Ealing comedy in the Coen Brothers' work, and FARGO's bungling bad guys could easily have come from the pen of William Rose, who created THE LADYKILLERS. It's no wonder Joel and Ethan went for a remake.The icing on the FARGO cake is an excellent score by Carter Burwell.A wonderful movie.",9,0,0,1 May 2007
Nightcrawler," Gripping and effective
","Gripping thriller that shares many tropes with NETWORK (1976) and BROADCAST NEWS (1987), as well as with Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM (1960) and, to some extent, with Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW (1954), but stakes out its own extremely creepy territory via the character of psychopathically amoral Louis Bloom. As this character, Jake Gyllenhaal moves entirely away from any screen persona you might have expected of him. His physical appearance will remind some of Christian Bale's gaunt and grizzly turn in THE MACHINIST(2004), but his glassy eyes and his vulpine smile are all his own, utterly remote from Donnie Darko's puppy-dog peepers and Jack Twist's vulnerable grin.There is superb support from brilliantly cast Riz Ahmed, as broke and bewildered Rick, who gets swept along in Bloom's deadly wake, and Rene Russo is excellent as the TV news producer who finds herself in the same boat. However even Russo's considerable skills can't prevent the role from seeming rather functional.The script is well constructed, the dialogue - especially from Bloom/Gyllenhaal - is of a high standard, and there are some nail-biting set pieces (including a terrifying car-chase: kudos to editor John Gilroy).All in all, NIGHTCRAWLER is an effective, though ultimately bleak, evaluation of aspects of American society, albeit in the guise of mass entertainment. It's good to look these issues in the face, which this film does.Recommended.",8,1,5,2 November 2014
Burn After Reading," Dark and funny
","A perfectly balanced blending of dark and funny, it's not just another Coen Brothers movie - it's their NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Like the Hitchcock classic, it boasts a brilliantly confected screenplay built around a plot mechanism - a McGuffin, as Hitch called such things - less substantial than air, involving government spies, secrets, duplicity and connivance. The Coens, as inventive as ever, add plastic surgery and keep-fit to the mix.Superbly performed by a top-notch cast (has Brad Pitt ever given a more delightful performance? I really don't think so) and particularly noteworthy for its witty editing (courtesy of the Brothers themselves, under the name of Roderick Jaynes), it is crammed full, like all vintage Coen-work, of characters whose own worst enemies are themselves.Some clearly find this sort of thing heartless, some find it far-fetched. I find it well-observed and sadly true-to-life.",8,1,1,21 October 2014
Bridge of Spies," Solid
","A solid piece of work by Spielberg and his collaborators. Tom Hanks, the James Stewart of our day, incarnates honourable American values but manages, in a way Stewart never would or probably could, to convey his awareness of their fragility. The business of holding fast to one's values in a challenging world is the spine of the film's message, dramatised in the relationship between spy Rudolph Abel and Hanks' character, lawyer James Donovan, in this tale of Cold War brinkmanship.Abel is played by someone who I have no hesitation in naming as one of our era's greatest actors: Mark Rylance. Very familiar to theatre audiences in the UK, he has appeared infrequently on screen. I have a feeling this situation is going to change as a result of his typically superb performance here. Watching him and Hanks play their scenes together was for me the film's main pleasure.Hanks is well partnered too in his scenes with Mikhail Gorevoy as a Russian diplomat and Sebastian Koch as an East German lawyer. Austin Stowell is excellently cast as Gary Powers, the American pilot whose capture reconfigures Abel's fate, and there are a number of other first rate cameos, including Peter McRobbie's turn as John Foster Dulles.The women have a rotten time. Amy Ryan has little to do but smile or worry as Hanks' wife. Nadja Bobyleva manages to make a mark with an emotional scene as the Berlin Wall is being built, one of the film's most chilling sequences.The film's stand-out sequence on the technical front is a terrifying plane crash, one of those jaw-dropping set-pieces that are hallmarks of a Spielberg movie. In this story there's not much room for another of those hallmarks - sentimentality - but where Spielberg can find it - mainly in the scenes around Hanks' family - he puts it in. Still and all, it's definitely worth going to see BRIDGE OF SPIES, not least for Rylance's masterclass in screen acting.",7,1,3,27 October 2015
"I, Robot"," sleep-inducing
","As we were watching this movie at our local cinema the soundtrack suddenly cut out for three or four minutes at a climactic moment and it seemed to me that everyone enjoyed it a lot more. People were putting their own sound effects to it. It was fun. As soon as the soundtrack started up again, in spite of the big noise coming out of the speakers, my partner managed to doze. It's sad because Will Smith can be good news and there was something quite interesting about the production design, but on the whole it was a big waste of time. The audience was pretty small for a blockbuster movie. Word seems to have got around that there's not much to be said for this one.",2,8,12,9 August 2004
Being John Malkovich," comparing John Malkovich
","This wonderful movie is, for me, below Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind in the triple-crown of Charlie Kaufman screenplays, of which Adaptation takes an honourable third place. In both Adaptation and, to a lesser extent, Being John Malkovich, ingenuity ends up taking precedence over emotion, resulting in two hugely entertaining but ultimately rather cool works of cinematic art. In Eternal Sunshine there is a palpable sense of loss of the loved one which, in spite of the less-than-warm casting of Jim Carrey, raises the script of that movie to a higher level.Of these three master-movies, Being John Malkovich is the one with the most endearing cast. What a bunch! Bumbling Orson Bean, dazzling Christine Keener, crumpled Cameron Diaz, furrowed John Cusak and, of course, that much put-upon all round good sport Mr Malkovich are all a joy. I watched them again on DVD the other evening and it was like meeting old friends.The other outstanding star of this fine film is the editor Eric Zumbrunnen, who performed the same function on Adaptation. Spike Jonze was at the helm of both movies, and needless to say did a superb job, not least in balancing the technical needs of the film with the relationships between the characters.",8,0,1,22 October 2007
Jackie," a slow lament
","Perhaps the idea was to make a movie in the style of a funeral cortege, as one long, slow lament. If so, writer Noah Oppenheim and director Pablo Larraín have succeeded. The result, though, is a ponderous, portentous, heavy-handed film, illuminated by Nathalie Portman's star turn as Jackie Kennedy. She is stunning, and is ably supported by Peter Skarsgaard, Billy Crudup, John Hurt and Greta Gerwig, among others. But when a cast like this, with a central performance as good as that, can't prevent the enterprise from sinking under the weight of its pretensions, there's not a lot to be said in mitigation. Mica Levy's Oscar-nominated score is among the casualties: beautiful music, which will sound great on an album I've no doubt, but it doesn't help the film escape its weary slog towards the end credits. Madeline Fontaine's costume designs, which also got an Oscar nod, are fortunately free from the obsequies.",4,5,8,27 January 2017
No Country for Old Men," excellent
","In Cormac McCarthy the Coen Brothers have evidently found a literary equivalent to their own world view, so close is No Country for Old Men to the stories they've been telling for so many years. Sheriff Bell's near-despair at the cruel carryings-on in the world he's attempting to police is an echo of Marge Gunderson's astonishment in Fargo, as she tries to make sense of the actions of the psychopath she's just arrested. In Fargo, Marge goes home to normal Norm, and some semblance of equilibrium is restored: not so in McCarthy's universe, which is a bleaker place. Everything about this film is top-notch. There are one or two moments in the narrative which fuel the conversation for the audience's journey home (how come Chigurh got arrested at the top of the film, and for what? how did he know Moss was heading for Mexico?) but really, these things are not important in the long run. The photography and the acting are terrific; the script - with, so I understand, significant chunks lifted seamlessly from the novel - is as dazzling as we've come to expect from the Coens. If I don't rate it quite as high as Fargo, I guess it's because, while I probably share the broad, bleak outlook of No Country for Old Men, I guess I must like a little bit of hope smuggled into representations of our brutal world. But that's just me. This is an excellent film, no doubt about it.",8,1,3,21 January 2008
The Pianist," gruelling, but worth it
","Polanski shows us genocide from the inside. We watch as his protagonist sees his world being blown apart. It is, as it should be, a grim experience, and just when it seems that nothing but desolation can emerge from it, the story turns. It's Shakespearean - the range of human possibilities, from merciless cruelty to the greatest nobility and courage, is on display. Almost every other film on the subject pales before it. See it - but don't expect an easy ride.",9,0,1,3 February 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Delicious
","If one measure of a work of art is how thoroughly it creates its own world, then this movie is completely successful. It is funny, witty, charming. There isn't a dull frame or a wasted moment. In the spirit of the Mitteleuropa that it dusts down and recreates, like the wares of its fictional baker, it is exquisitely crafted and delicious. It is nostalgic whilst casting a shrewd light on nostalgia, and only superficially superficial.Whilst I'm sure Ralph Fiennes is very grateful for his career, it is nevertheless true that the role that brought him to Hollywood's attention, Amon Goeth in SCHINDLER'S LIST, set him off on an occasionally tedious course of broody psychopaths and intense romantics. Here he seizes his chance to prove himself an excellent light comedian, clearly enjoying this opportunity to gently mock his previous film personae. He is captivating. It's unlikely he'll get any formal recognition for this, as comedy fares badly at award ceremonies for some inexplicable reason.One of the film's great pleasures is watching a superb cast clearly having a great time. Cameos fly by, none more enjoyable than Bill Murray's. What extraordinary presence that man has on the screen! Among the other goodies are real gravitas from F. Murray Abraham, snarling malice from Adrien Brody, and finger-licking psychopathy from Wilem Dafoe. Praise too for Tony Revolori and Saoirse Ronan as the completely unsentimental but entirely necessary lovers.A real treat.",9,8,19,11 March 2014
Foxcatcher," Truly tragic
","FOXCATCHER slowly, inexorably, tightens its grip. I found myself becoming more and more tense watching it, which is a sign of how involved I was in Bennett Miller's telling of this melancholy tale of loneliness, delusion and betrayed trust.The film is totally dependent on its three remarkable leading actors. In terms of public recognition, Channing Tatum's contribution seems to have been taken for granted, with no individual award nominations for him, as far as I'm aware. This is unfair. He matches the high standards of Steve Carell and Mark Ruffalo: no mean achievement.The exposition is a little ham-fisted, maybe. But apart from that, it's a well-written movie. Some, I know, have found the pace too slow, but I can't see any other way for its boa-constrictor effect to work, carefully coiling around you and gradually squeezing out all the air...In retrospect, Bennett Miller's bloated biopic CAPOTE can be excused as a dry-run for FOXCATCHER. Both are about emotionally wrecked rich kids attracted by the virility and vitality of an equally damaged man from the other side of the tracks. CAPOTE attempts to raise its story to the level of tragedy but fails, because its central figure cannot reach beyond pathos. FOXCATCHER is a truly tragic tale. You emerge from it shaking your head at its inevitability.",8,2,6,1 February 2015
Behind The Candelabra," A triumph
","This is a first-rate piece of work by Mr Soderbergh and his team (kudos to Ellen Mirojnick's flamboyant costumes and Howard Cummings' outrageous interiors). The otherwise excellent screenplay by Richard LaGravanese loses a little steam around two-thirds of the way through, but recovers to give a genuinely touching conclusion.Nominally this is a biopic. In fact, it uses the biopic format to examine a particular relationship in depth. The narrative focus is on the dynamic between two people rather than the inner turmoil of one. This, as well as the director's good taste, has kept at bay the sprawling pretentiousness and sentimentality which usually infest the genre, regardless of how good the central performances are: films as diverse as LA VIE EN ROSE and MILK have been scuppered in this way. Not so BEHIND THE CANDELABRA, which is an altogether more sophisticated affair.The acting is dazzling. Michael Douglas, in a beautifully-written role, communicates the complexity of a real human being, not just a two-dimensional celebrity. At the same time, he gives full value to Liberace's famous showmanship. A star performance, sure - the subject demands it - but also much, much more.Matt Damon is a revelation. For me, up till now, he has represented the worst kind of dead-behind-the-eyes, don't-dare-express-anything movie acting. The nearest I came to thinking any different was his turn as the scout in the Coen Brothers' remake of TRUE GRIT. In BEHIND THE CANDELABRA he displays a range I never thought he had in him. The character moves from naivety through rage to despair and on to quiet understanding. Really, really terrific.The two leads create a totally believable relationship between their characters, in all its aspects. A triumph.The icing on the cake is the supporting cast, led by Dan Aykroyd and Scott Bakula, and spangled with cameos from Rob Lowe, Debbie Reynolds, Bruce Ramsay, Cheyenne Jackson and Paul Reiser.Here in England we're fortunate to see this film on big screens. As is well known, it was financed by a TV company (HBO) and will not be released theatrically in the USA. That tells a sad story about the American movie industry, from which an independent-minded artist like Mr Soderbergh is wise to walk away.",8,30,36,11 June 2013
Gone Girl," treading old ground
","A pass-the-time movie, occasionally gripping. Its origin in her novel is not particularly well disguised by the author's screenplay, with over-reliance on voice-overs. Her skill with dialogue, though, is excellent.The story has so many genre echoes (SUSPICION [1941], MARNIE, FATAL ATTRACTION, BASIC INSTINCT etc etc) that in spite of the plot's twists and turns it still feels as if it's treading old ground. The pace is often unhelpfully leisurely, whilst the last fifteen minutes feel over-compressed, as if all concerned wanted to make an even longer film but realised the thriller element would suffer if any extra length was added.Director David Fincher (SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB, ZODIAC), known for his dim, dark, moody shots, treads a line between style and stylistic tic. Personally I thought the look of the movie was needlessly indistinct.Ben Affleck ambles pleasantly through another of his Ordinary Guy roles. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry offer competent support. But the film really belongs to three excellent women who shine in a trio of succulent roles: Carrie Coon as Mr Affleck's twin sister, Kim Dickens as a smart detective, and Rosamund Pike as the wife with hidden depths.In truth Ms Pike's bravura performance is the main reason to see GONE GIRL. She transcends the movie's limitations to dazzling effect.",6,3,28,4 October 2014
Room," Quality
","Very powerful. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give tremendous performances as a young mother her five-year-old son who live in the eponymous room. As their story unfolds, the film begins to tighten its grip, so it's a pity that around this time in the story there are a couple of not very believable aspects to the plot. Never mind: once they're out of the way, the final section of what is essentially a three-act drama raises the emotional temperature further. I confess I was a tear-stained rag at the end.The presence of Joan Allen and William H. Macy in supporting roles is a testament to the quality of a project they clearly felt they wanted to be part of. Sean Bridgers, Tom McCamus and Amanda Brugel also make noteworthy contributions.On the basis of this, and of that excellent, eccentric movie FRANK, it's easy to see that Lenny Abrahamson is a superb director of actors, with an interest in and an understanding of the complexity of people's relationships.",8,2,8,16 December 2015
Dog Day Afternoon," What a great movie!
","What a great movie! Visiting it again after a near forty-year gap, I'm astounded how well it stands up, in spite of it being so firmly rooted in the 1970s. It's definitely one of the top NYC pictures: the opening sequence captures the city in many moods and places before homing in on a Brooklyn bank, scene of a botched robbery by Sonny (Pacino) and Sal (Cazale). What follows is constantly engaging.One of the many fascinating things about DOG DAY AFTERNOON is the quality of the acting, both on an individual and collective level. Pacino is extraordinary as Sonny. Gentle and angry, crazy and lucid, a volatile pack of explosives threatening to detonate at any moment. But he is given rock-solid support from Cazale, Durning (amazing), James Broderick, Chris Sarandon, and the entire ensemble of bank hostages led by terrific Penelope Allen. The only cast member who doesn't score a bullseye is Judith Malina as Pacino's mother: there's something not quite right about her big scene, though I can't put my finger on what. It needed Lee Grant, or Estelle Parsons. But it's a tiny cavil. A work of art doesn't need to be perfect to be great. The two rarely go together, in my experience.The camera work ranges effortlessly over documentary-style helicopter shots over the city to classic claustrophobic close-ups in the bank. The editing by Dede Allen is breathtakingly good - it's completely absurd that she did not win the year's Oscar for her work here. The whole is masterminded brilliantly by Sidney Lumet, at the top of his game.A classic.",10,0,1,20 May 2014
Call Me by Your Name," Haunting
","Timothée Chalamet sets the bar very high. He is entirely natural, you never feel he's acting, yet he communicates every skipped heartbeat of his character's love. Armie Hammer, meanwhile, impresses in a completely different way as Oliver, an American arrived in Italy to work as an academic assistant for six weeks . Initially presenting himself as an old head on young shoulders, Mr Hammer seems to shed years as the story progresses, his spirit freed by his encounter with Chalamet's Elio.The first hour of this remarkable film winds up the sexual tension to an almost unendurable pitch, as misunderstandings give rise to missed opportunities and missteps. The course of true love never did run smooth....The film is not without flaws. Only an actor as good as Michael Stuhlbarg, as Elio's father (who is Oliver's employer) could convert a self-conscious, set-piece speech into the moving, compassionate declaration that we get. And although on occasion Luca Guadagnino's direction borders on genius -- including the astonishing final scene -- it occasionally resorts to unsubtle symbolism that would turn into something comic if it weren't for the commitment of the actors. All that aside, I find many images, lines of dialogue, and Mr Chalamet's incredible intensity, haunting me. I expect this will continue for quite a while yet.",8,8,21,14 November 2017
The Illusionist," Disappointing
","There's a lot to recommend this movie. The performances are all excellent, in particular those of Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell, who clearly relish their succulent roles. The photography is outstanding, justly earning DOP Dick Pope an Oscar nomination. The story is intriguing and well-told by director/writer Neil Burger. By a third of the way through it dawns on you that the political thread of the plot is making a clever comment on the illusory nature of power. But as time passes this promising idea is forsaken, and the whole enterprise reveals itself be a soufflé that in its last five minutes collapses into a soggy disappointment.",5,0,1,24 June 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," Terrific Tobey
","A magnificent, barnstorming performance from Tobey Maguire is the mainstay of this interesting movie about chess champion Bobby Fischer. Maguire's technique runs the gamut, from tiny eye movements to full-scale harangues, from the subtlest of gestures to the wildest.He builds Bobby on a bedrock of self-confidence while also managing to suggest that same confidence is a massive defence against vulnerability. The film makes a parallel between Fischer's paranoia and that of America in the Cold War, but what could merely have been an idea is made vivid by Maguire's stupendous acting.He is very well supported by Michael Stulhbarg, Peter Sarsgaard and Liev Schreiber. Women don't get much of a look-in, unfortunately, but of the three who emerge from the male fog Robin Weigert makes a strong impression as Fischer's beleaguered mother.Edward Zwick keeps the pace going admirably, aided by Steven Rosenblum's deft editing. I'm less sure about the overall look of the film, and uneasy about its shift to a finale of patriotic triumphalism that it had managed so hard to avoid - even to the extent of satire - up to that point.Unmissable for Maguire.",7,4,8,10 December 2015
Million Dollar Baby," boxing and fighting
","This excellent film is set in the world of boxing, yes, and sure enough it is about fighting - against oneself, against the restrictions of background, against prejudice and preconception. It links with Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN in being about that too - forgiving yourself, not forgiving yourself, forgiving but not forgetting. The screenplay, which is mostly wonderful, has one or two moments, that's all, of clunkiness, in which it feels just a little bit consciously contrived. The only reason I mention it is because nothing else does feel contrived. The rest has the inevitability of the very best drama. Swank is magnificent. The film is superbly directed - the man is indeed a master. Just one example: think of all the overuse that slow-mo gets in movies today, and in previous movies set in the ring. In this movie there is only one moment where it's used, and of course its power is tremendous because of the general restraint. Go see.",8,1,3,20 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," it's a bit dry, but it's worth seeing
","Doesn't work as a piece of story-telling but it has a lot to commend it, notably the acting, in particular the central performance by David Strathairn and a very fine one by Frank Langella. The choice of black-and-white was presumably made so that the archive footage would fit in pretty much seamlessly, and I think this pretty much worked, although the use of a haze of cigarette smoke was overused. I could see the point of the little subplots but they still seemed kind of malnourished. As a history film it seems to me to be preferable to the Spielberg or Mel Gibson approaches, which err on the side of entertainment. There's no doubting the seriousness of Good Night and Good Luck - it avoids sentimentality except, maybe, in one area, which is in its uncritical acceptance of journalists as latter-day knights, guardians of our freedoms. Ed Murrows are few and far between, after all. Most journalists would never have dared to do what he did. I would imagine that Clooney and his team decided that to show a counterbalance to the crusading journalism on view would involve broadening the film out and weakening its power. So what we get is a rather dry affair, but it was worth making and is worth seeing. Keep an eye on your freedoms, this film says. That is a worthwhile message.",6,3,5,1 March 2006
The Dark Knight," Trapped
","Just because something is said seriously doesn't mean it's profound. That's the main problem with this largely bloated and pretentious enterprise. The dialogue feels as though it's been translated from another language by someone lacking any sense of irony. Most of the actors are trapped by their roles - and, I suppose, their director - into speaking as if they were in a samurai movie, only without the cultural backup to make this ritualistic approach believable.Free of this criticism are Maggie Gyllenhaal, Aaron Eckhart and the great, greatly missed Heath Ledger. This excellent trio, along with the visual effects team, make it possible to stay to the end.",6,0,2,30 June 2015
Everest," because it's there
","Very impressive technically, well enough acted given the difficulty of making any kind of mark when there are so many characters, and nowhere near as badly written as I'd anticipated, this is a solid movie that tells of an episode in the existence of a mountain.The huge scale of the scenery is pitted against the puniness of the humans. As the cast make their way over bottomless crevasses and veer far too near the edge of the next ridge, it does get genuinely scary from time to time. The action sequences are skillfully filmed and edited, and definitely worth experiencing in 3D and big sound.Those are the plus points. The minuses are to do with the compromises required to fit the story into the tight shoes of commercial cinema. It's not just a matter of clunky exposition. It's the presence of big name actors who, excellent as they all are (and I am a real fan of Jake Gyllenhaal) inevitably stand out as faces against their lesser known colleagues. They can't help but turn EVEREST into one of those all-star disaster movies like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE or THE TOWERING INFERNO. I think it would have been better not to have the stars. They militate against the true-to-life, in memoriam aspect of the film.",5,0,0,22 September 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," room for improvement
","This is the first of Potter films of which I felt I'd have done well to have read the book so that I could be let into the story more fully. The earlier movies, for all their faults, entertained me on their own terms, whereas with this one I was aware of time ticking by, so I was clearly not engrossed in it. What remains of an unquestionably high standard is the seemingly never-ending supply of excellent UK actors. Imelda Staunton makes a contribution that would be outstanding in any movie: I hope she wins recognition for it when the awards come around. There is also some engaging work from the youngsters: Daniel Radcliffe has become a good young actor - perhaps unsurprising, considering he's been able to learn from the very best. Unfortunately, Emma Watson's gifts seem to be travelling in the opposite direction: she is effortlessly outshone by newcomer Evanna Lynch.Or maybe Hermione is just a duller role.The author's fully-imagined world is what appeals to me about these films - though it is not sufficiently appealing to impel me towards her doorstop novels. I appreciate that it is extremely difficult to capture the detail of a work of literature on screen. I can also understand that Ms Rowling and her filmmakers feel an obligation to the hordes of young fans who want to see as much of the books as possible on the screen. Until now these adaptations have trodden a pretty much successful path. I hope they find their way again for the last two outings.",4,1,2,5 August 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," masterwork
","I never expected to give a movie with Jim Carrey in it anything more than mild support, but this is a masterpiece, and Carrey's excellent performance contributes enormously to it. Don't let reviews fool you into thinking that this movie is some kind of cold intellectual game. Not only is it about human vulnerability and the recognition and acceptance of our own imperfections as a starting point to acknowledging those of others. It is also a political movie in the best possible sense, the American pioneer myth of being able to forget the past and start all over again being given an extraordinary twist. Altogether a great work of art, worth seeing again and again and again. Strides ahead of MALKEVICH and ADAPTATION, those excellent movies can be seen as very enjoyable apprentice projects. A moving, compassionate, funny, imaginative, wise and completely enjoyable work. Do not under any circumstances miss it.",9,0,1,3 May 2004
Frank," well worth seeing
","Funny, endearing movie led with a strange, flinty charm by Domhnall Gleeson, and expertly directed by Lenny Abrahamson. Within what is fundamentally a straightforward story, a lot of themes are packed - artistic credibility, the easy triumph of mediocrity, the nature of identity and individuality. And there are more. Too many, really.The writers are keen to maintain a light tone, as if wary that the heavier themes might weigh us all down too much. Fortunately they have two major, definitely not mediocre, talents on hand to maintain the required balance: Michael Fassbender and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who are both amazing. For Fassbender in particular there needs to be a special award for succeeding in being intensely moving whilst wearing a false head.So although the movie as a whole doesn't quite add up to more than the sum of its parts, it is nonetheless a wonderfully quirky, often hilarious, strangely touching piece of work. Well worth seeing and supporting.",7,45,72,17 May 2014
La La Land," Believe the hype
","What a great movie! Who would have thought anyone could bring the original screen musical back from the dead? Yet here it is, hale and hearty.The music is melodic but never simplistic; the lyrics are intelligent and intelligible; the script is funny, touching without ever resorting to sentimentality; the two leads are not only skillful but full of a kind of charm that I honestly thought had disappeared entirely from American movies: but here we have Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just oozing it.The only pebbles in this ocean of inventiveness are some routine dance routines and over-reliance on the device of lights dimming on set to isolate an actor in white light, but that's me being r-e-a-l-l-y picky. It may well be that this is the best musical written directly for the screen since SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS.All credit to writer-director Damien Chazelle and his team - and it really feels like a team-movie - for giving us this gem. Sure it's a feelgood piece, but it creates a world which is complex, it acknowledges alternative outcomes for its characters, it connects with people's passions, and in the case of Ms Stone's big solo, 'Audition', it has a bona fide classic.",9,239,455,9 October 2016
Love & Mercy," Music and madness
","A biopic of, and a homage to, Brian Wilson. Most of the time it succeeds in avoiding the tackiness of the genre because of the structure of its screenplay, which splits Brian into two (occasionally three, counting fleeting appearances of him as a child). This strategy was used to great effect (and with a larger number of 'selves') in He's Not There, Todd Haynes' fascinating film about Bob Dylan, and I'm sure it's no accident that Oren Moverman, Haynes' collaborator on the screenplay of that movie, is a co-author of Love & Mercy.The two Brians here are brilliantly played by Paul Dano and John Cusack, two of Hollywood's finest. Dano, with more to chew on, is especially noteworthy. They are supported superbly by Elizabeth Banks' quiet compassion and Paul Giamatti's dangerous volatility. John Camp contributes a fine performance as Wilson's violent, emotionally blackmailing father.Another star of Love & Mercy is its production design, which makes brilliantly expressive use of colour contrasts. And of course there's the music, the sound of The Beach Boys. The scenes recreating their studio sessions are simultaneously celebratory and poignant, especially for those of us who were young when these wonderful songs first emerged.But, to its credit, the movie is not a nostalgia-fest. Having avoided that trap, however, it occasionally falls into another, making connections between madness and genius that can't ever be proved: were Wilson's mental illness or his drug abuse contributors to his visionary talent? No one can know. The movie tries to have it both ways by suggesting that LSD was an influence on Pet Sounds, while also portraying Brian's illness as an obstacle to the expression of his gift. This apart, the screenplay, ably directed by Bill Pohlad, is pretty strong.Best for me is a wonderful conversation between Wilson-Dano and his session drummer. The latter has played with 'em all - Elvis, Phil Spector, Sam Cooke - but tells Brian that he's better than any of them. The look of modest yet profound gratitude on Dano's face powerfully packs the lack of praise he's had from his father, the incomprehension of his brothers and cousin (his fellow Beach Boys) at the depth of his talent, and his desperate need for love. In one respect this is quite a clichéd scene in terms of what the drummer actually says, but the film has created a context in which Wilson's whole dilemma is suddenly made vivid, an opportunity which Dano, a sensitive and gifted actor, seizes and transforms into something great.",8,9,12,10 November 2015
Beauty and the Beast," Lacking
","Ah, these time-honoured classic stories, such easy money for the studios. Well, maybe not that easy. Although this one has had megadollars thrown at it, it never gets off the ground. Emma Watson in the lead is, I think, attempting feistiness, but although it may be a part of her in spirit, it doesn't communicate itself to an audience from the screen. Nor is Dan Stevens' easy charm up to the demands of the prince-beast, not helped by the bestial side being entirely CGI instead of motion-capture: a strange decision.The extra songs by Alan Mencken and Tim Rice don't add anything much to the score of the 1991 animated film. Emma Thompson's rendition of the title number does, however, match Angela Lansbury's original, both in warmth and sparkle. I'm sad to say that it's pretty much the only example of something in this new version rising to such a comparison.The production design is brilliant and sumptuous but, at the mercy of the choice of 18th century France as the movie's chosen period, sometimes feels crowded in the frame, over-busy, fussy. The costumes somehow rise above this limitation, especially in the finale.Of the other performers, Ewan McGregor and Audra McDonald shine out, but Luke Evans, as vain, villainous Gaston, gives dynamic, high-octane value, wiping the floor with both Ms Watson and Mr Stevens.I've no doubt it'll make its budget back in gazillions, but, unlike the studio's revamped Jungle Book, this is decidedly second-hand.",6,4,11,20 March 2017
Sicario," Border disputes
","If, like me, you like that disoriented feeling of not quite knowing what's going on or what's going to happen, this is a movie for you. A gripping, atmospheric thriller without those horrible, clunky scenes of exposition. What's really going on only becomes clear well over halfway through.The powerful opening sequence sets the tone for this tale of the moral degradation surrounding drug cartels. There are several other jaw-dropping set-pieces, but the film is never bloated by them, since they are skillfully contrasted with small-scale scenes, whether set in a police interrogation room or a kitchen or a bedroom. Director Denis Villeneuve and editor Joe Walker do a brilliant job of controlling the pace. Also noteworthy are Roger Deakins' cinematography and JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson's score.Emily Blunt is excellent, cast against type as an all-action police officer. Even better is Benicio del Toro as her mysterious colleague: a compelling, charismatic performance.Highly recommended, especially for those who like having to concentrate on what's happening on screen.",8,1,5,28 October 2015
Mystic River," quite a few weaknesses - POSSIBLE SPOILER
","This movie has a number of weaknesses. Kevin Bacon in a pivotal role is way outclassed by everyone else. Robbins gives the standout performance, but because Penn's is the flashier role - and he does it very well - he's getting all the raves. Marcia Gay Harden is likewise excellent, and the two-hander scenes between any of those three are the redeeming features of the movie. Linney's and Fishburne's considerable talents are wasted. The screenplay is often clunky - those plodding cop scenes between Bacon and Fishburne are almost insulting, the tough-guy conversations between Penn and his henchmen are cliche-ridden, and the whole final section - events in and around the parade - redundant. The double climax needs a much more sophisticated approach than Mr Eastwood gives it, although the screenplay is perhaps the villain here. All in all, this is way behind UNFORGIVEN as an achievement, although a better stab at the genre than his MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL.",3,0,1,21 October 2003
12 Years a Slave," As high as cinema can go
","It's rare that a movie lives up to its hype, even rarer that the hype is transcended by the actual achievement. 12 YEARS A SLAVE does both. Aided by powerful performances and cinematography, director McQueen exposes the barbarity of dehumanisation, of treating people as property. Reviews focus on the brutality on display, and it's true that the film is not easy to watch, with its powerful juxtaposition of sublime scenery and human degradation. But to me the final scene is the most powerful of all: we are party to the kind of raw emotion that in the hands of lesser artists could easily descend into tawdriness or sentimentality. Here, as in the rest of the film, it is raised up high, as high as cinematic art can go.",10,34,57,12 January 2014
There Will Be Blood," masterful
","A gripping film from Paul Thomas Anderson. Expertly photographed and designed, with some amazing set pieces, including an oil-field fire which will bring back unpleasant memories for those of us who remember America's first war with Iraq, which may well have been in the director's mind: Mr Anderson is not afraid of powerful symbolism, as admirers of Magnolia will recall.There Will Be Blood is a tale of single-minded acquisitiveness and greed. The central character, Daniel Plainview (great name!) is not able to tolerate any opposition or competition. Various stumbling-blocks, entrepreneurial and/or emotional, present themselves, the longest lasting ending in an extraordinary stand-off between Plainview and a fellow opportunist, played superbly by Paul Dano.It's a long movie, but the time flies by. In fact for me the final half-hour or so is over-compressed, as though material from the source novel by Upton Sinclair was being glossed over by the movie's final time-jump. Probably unavoidable, and almost certainly the right decision, but I wonder if there are cut scenes that might surface in the DVD release...Regardless of this, the final scene is extraordinary.Daniel Day-Lewis is breathtaking as Plainview. It's not just the sheer charisma of the man: the size of the performance, the truth of every moment, the complexity of thought that is shown crystal-clearly to the audience without any feeling of telegraphing, the sustaining of character through long takes with on occasions enormous physical demands: all this is jaw-dropping stuff.In accepting an award for his role, Day-Lewis mentioned the passing of Heath Ledger, and has had some stick for it in the press because the two had never met, yet Day-Lewis was clearly moved at the passing of his fellow actor. For me it's clear that Ledger's performance in Brokeback Mountain has something in common with Day-Lewis's performance in There Will Be Blood, and that is this sense of uniqueness: the role and the actor were an all-time perfect match. As it was impossible to imagine any of Heath Ledger's contemporaries finding a way of triumphing over the challenges of bringing Ennis del Mar to life, it's equally impossible to imagine any of Day-Lewis' contemporaries scaling the heights, and plumbing the depths, of Daniel Plainview. Actually, in Day-Lewis' case, it's hard to imagine any of his predecessors managing it either. Not even Nicholson or Bogart, neither of whom could bring grandeur to the role - no disrespect to either: it's just that grandeur wasn't their thing. They made their careers at least in part by undercutting grandeur. Which leaves only, maybe, John Huston, who was able to blend a certain patrician quality with gnarled pragmatism in his few screen roles But could he have technically sustained the acting bravura of Day-Lewis in, say, the baptism scene of There Will Be Blood? I don't think so.To sum up, this is a masterful movie, with a benchmark central performance.",8,2,6,9 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Not without flaws
","This is a very fine movie in many ways, most of which were rightly recognised on its release. It is marred, though, by a script (possibly accurately reproducing the tone of the source novel, which I've not read) which has an overly simplistic approach to its characters, in particular to its protagonist McMurphy and his nemesis Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is our typical anti-hero, held up for our approval in spite of being an unrepentant apologist for grim offences; whilst Nurse Ratched is shown no mercy (and therefore given no depth) by the authors. This could have made for a two-dimensional movie. Fortunately the actors reached way beyond the binary world they were presented with and infused their characters with, in Nicholson's case, roguish charm and, in Louise Fletcher's case, inner complexity. They are both magnificent and richly deserved every award they won for their performances.They are superbly supported by a remarkable crew of scene-stealers - Danny Devito, Sydney Lassick, Scatman Carruthers, Christopher Lloyd, William Redfield, Will Sampson - and by a quietly effective, apparently one-off performance by Lan Fendors as Ratched's assistant nurse.The polarities of the film - conformism/individualism, control/freedom - are eternally important themes in our lives. In Milos Forman the film had a director who completely understood the significance of the material, crafting a film of real power with his DOP Haskell Wexler. But to me its message is weakened by the way its women - with the exception of Ms Fendors' taciturn nurse - are polarised as either dragons or whores. I've read that before Ms Fletcher was offered the role of Nurse Ratched, a number of actresses had turned it down because of the script was so misogynistic. This demonstrates why Ms Fletcher's achievement is so great: she carefully sidestepped the dragon the script offered up, instead creating someone altogether more difficult to write off in such simple terms. It is an outstanding performance, and remains the best reason to revisit this film.",8,2,4,17 February 2014
The Last King of Scotland," excellent political thriller
","Essentially a political thriller, this movie is also a warning against easy idealism. In a small way, the warning chafes against the more conventional thriller aspect, at least in the closing quarter of an hour. Never mind that: this is otherwise a well-written film with excellent production values. The photography is particularly good - not overly glossy in the way that so many such films are, and with a real sense of the atmosphere of Uganda. The editing is also very fine. And the acting is terrific. McAvoy makes a believable journey from cocky youth through accidental henchman to guilt-ridden victim. Whitaker is breathtakingly good as Amin - charm one moment, terror the next, taking you off guard. If he doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination, there's no justice. Actually the Oscar lot are generally good about rewarding actors playing people who actually lived, so he's in with a good chance, despite his movie-makers' attempt to undermine his performance in the final moments of the film by showing pictures of the real Amin. Fortunately Whitaker is so amazing that the attempt fails completely. The supporting cast is also first-rate, as witnessed by the ever-subtle, ever-enigmatic Gillian Anderson - what a superb artist she is!",8,2,3,22 January 2007
Finding Dory," tedious
","I laughed a couple of times at the octopus, but otherwise this was tedious stuff, the worst kind of baby-food: sugary and cloying. Is this really the same company that brought us the wit and wisdom of TOY STORY, WALL-E or UP? If so, it is unrecognisable.All that technical know-how, all that talent, wasted on this sentimental slush.I know, I know. I obviously left my sense of humour outside the cinema. It's making the company a fortune, so what do I know? Evidently not much. All that matters is that the children love it, right? Who cares if it pickles their imaginations by conjuring up a non-world, something that could only exist in the swarming collective brain of a gigantic corporation?I recommend running early Pixar or classic Disney for your young ones. They've stood the test of time, which FINDING DORY will inevitably fail on account of its unacceptably high sugar content.",1,9,17,1 January 2017
Arrival," Comes and goes
","Full of good things, and enjoyable and intriguing to watch, this is ultimately a masquerade of a picture, superficially offering science-fiction while increasingly claiming to be about something more profound. It doesn't really make the transition effectively, and has more than a whiff of M. Night Shyamalan about it, with its climactic twist.The good things are Amy Adams, who carries all the movie's emotional content on her shoulders as linguist Louise Banks; the cinematography, which is full of interesting colours and contrasts; and the music, a kind of follow-up by Jóhann Jóhannsson to his score for SICARIO for the same director.Jeremy Renner's role is notable for being the eye-candy, very much hanging behind Ms Adams as Ms Banks, in a welcome reversal of the Hollywood norm.It's well-crafted, but once you've left the cinema, it's as if it never happened.",6,2,8,29 November 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Virtual virtuosity
","The stars of this movie are Director of Photography Emmanuel Lubezki, editors Stephen Mirrione and Douglas Crise, and drummer/composer Antonio Sanchez. They are the leads in Alejandro González Iñárritu's cinematic tour-de-force.The acting is, as you'd expect from this collection of actors, of the highest quality. But even these major talents (and they really don't come much much more major than Lindsay Duncan, one of the great names of the British stage) didn't prevent me from taking more of an interest in how the illusion of a film made of one take was achieved. It's even beyond the achievement of Aleksandr Sokurov's Russian ARK, which really WAS in one take.The downside is that BIRDMAN is so witty, clever, self-referential, culturally aware and artistically impressive that it drowns its characters in its virtuosity. I began to wonder whether that was the director's intention, but I just couldn't believe Signor Iñárritu would be egomanic enough to play a huge joke on his cast and his audience buy spending two hours of screen time satirising egomania. So I guess it must be about something else. Whatever it was, I missed it.Still, it's a remarkable piece of work, and I'm very glad I've seen it.",8,3,9,7 January 2015
The Big Short," Excellent, ultimately bleak
","Accomplished and informative movie from Adam McKay and his team. Special kudos to Hank Corwin for his fast but never flashy editing.Superbly acted, with a nice little part for co-producer Brad Pitt, who is always at his best in supporting roles.Looking at some of the message board postings about this movie, it's evident that the blame game for the financial meltdown of 2007/8 continues, which kind of misses the point of the movie, which is that the whole thing has started up again. Neither governments, nor banks, nor the public seem to care enough about the damage of a cycle of boom and bust to really do anything about it. They – we – smell money.Excellent film. Mostly funny. Ultimately bleak.",8,40,65,14 December 2015
Marriage Story," An improvement
","This is a lot better than Mr Baumbach's deadly 'The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)', over which it's better to draw a veil. There is another film lurking in the shadows, however: 'Kramer vs Kramer', of which 'Marriage Story' might be considered a kind of 30-years-have-gone-by update. The ambition and unselfconscious self-obsession of Adam Driver's character is shared by Dustin Hoffman's in the earlier film. But Scarlett Johansson's character is allowed not to feel as guilty as Meryl Streep's for believing that she could be a better mother if she could be a whole person. Baumbach gives Laura Dern, Ray Liotta and Alan Alda very good speeches as a trio of lawyers explaining how the courts will stitch the opposing parties up.There are some funny lines and one really excellent scene in which the leads tear into each other, no holds barred. But it's Driver's raw delivery of a Sondheim song that will probably impress most.I wish I'd've liked it more, but in the end the travails of those in Mr Baumbach's navel-gazing world are not perhaps as universal as he might like to think.",6,21,48,14 November 2019
The Queen," Grande Dame
","The magnificent Helen Mirren dominates this entertaining film. The deft script daisy-petal picks the issues off one by one. The dovetailing of archive footing with scenes recreated for the movie is excellently done, the pacing is certain - all in all, everything one would expect from the practised hand of Stephen Frears. The fine supporting cast includes two of the UK's most distinguished theatre actors - Roger Allam and Alex Jennings - as well as Michael Sheen delighting us with his well-practised and beautifully observed Tony Blair. The whole thing has the feel of a made-for-TV movie, in spite of the breathtaking helicopter shots of the Scottish Highlands. I'm not sure that it amounts to much, but there's no reason to complain about one-and-three-quarter hours of Dame Helen - she's terrific.",7,2,4,15 September 2006
Son of Saul," Astonishing
","This film is an astonishing tour-de-force. I don't recall seeing anything like it before.Fictions set in Nazi concentration camps need to be handled very carefully indeed if they are not to diminish, even trivialise, what took place there. Such films are difficult to criticise, because their subject matter is not only historical fact, it is also the ultimate depravity of human beings. Art must deal with it, because nothing can lie outside of art's sphere, but really it is not a fit subject for bad art, such as Spielberg's Schindler's List. With its beautifully-played violin theme and its clever girl-in-the-red-coat in a black-and-white film, Spielberg used the vocabulary of a Hollywood movie to present this profound subject. Nothing that even its very committed actors could do was able to ground the piece in a convincing reality. The result, as far as I was concerned, in spite of what I'm sure were the best of intentions of the director and his team, was little short of repulsive.Since seeing Schindler's List I have steered clear of films attempting to depict life in the camps. I haven't seen Life is Beautiful, for example, nor The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. For all I know, they are works of genius. Son of Saul definitely is: not only does it not betray the cruelty, the tragedy of the camps, it brings it home in such a vivid way that it is sometimes extremely difficult to watch. But it is necessary to watch. In fact, it must be watched more than once, because it is not only emotionally draining, it is also amazing technically, but because it sweeps you up in its reality, it is impossible to take in the technical achievements on only one viewing.Son of Saul was directed by László Nemes, written by Mr Nemes and Clara Royer, and photographed unnervingly by Mátyás Erdély. Saul himself is incarnated by Géza Röhrig, superbly leading an excellent ensemble.",10,46,81,25 November 2015
Deadpool," Where's Bugs Bunny when you need him?
","This is a self-satisfied, sexist little romp, with a few laughs and an affable central performance from Ryan Reynolds, one of many Ben Affleck clones currently doing the Hollywood rounds. It amazes me that anyone could possibly mistake it as in any way progressive. Its postmodern 'We know we're in a movie'is as contemporary as a Bugs Bunny cartoon.Ed Skrein gives good villain, it's a treat to see Leslie Uggams enjoying herself in a supporting role, and there's a nice sardonic turn from T.J. Miller. The music, by Junkie XL aka Tom Holkenborg, is, in contrast to the movie as a whole, unselfconsciously generic, and is all the more enjoyable for it.DEADPOOL will pass slightly too much of your time. It could have been shortened by ten minutes without anyone noticing. Otherwise, there's not a lot to be said for it.",3,8,19,20 January 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Perfectly judged
","This is a funny, gory, beautifully structured movie. There are some genuinely scary moments, as well as a number of set pieces that are jaw-droppingly good. There is, I must admit, a gaping unlikelihood in an otherwise solidly-put-together story, but bigger, bloodier events prevent you from lingering over it. Its running time has been perfectly judged. Having sat through 130 heavy-going minutes of DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES a few nights before made me particularly grateful for the slim, trim pace of CABIN.I was watching it for the third time. It's turning into one of my favourites.",9,0,2,12 August 2014
Spectre," Last of the Premium Bonds?
","Full of interesting things, SPECTRE is nevertheless a step down from the heights of its predecessor. SKYFALL was barely a Bond movie at all: it concerned itself with a man who had a tragic childhood and explored the consequences within the confines of a genre movie. SPECTRE tries to do the same thing but, the old-style Bond film is more present.As an actor, Daniel Craig has a far greater range than any of his predecessors as 007, and the producers, seeing what they had, exploited it, in line with the fashionable self-examination of comic-book heroes that was taking place in the SPIDERMAN and BATMAN franchises. Inevitably some people don't like it, while others applaud it. I'm in two minds about it, myself. I do feel that SPECTRE takes itself too seriously, making it too sombre to enjoy in the way we enjoyed From Russia With Love or Goldfinger. On the other hand, compared to the witless, vacuous ROGUE NATION, the latest from the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE franchise, SPECTRE is a masterpiece. But I have a friend who considers witlessness and vacuity to be the vital ingredients of this kind of film, that the absence of psychological realism and presence of one-dimensional performers such as Mr Cruise are the principal reasons such movies give so much pleasure. I understand that point of view. All the same, I'd rather spend time watching a good actor like Daniel Craig.For me, the level of acting in the recent Bond films constitutes their main pleasure. In SKYFALL there was Judi Dench and Javier Bardem. Here in SPECTRE we have Andrew Scott, Lea Seydoux and an unusually restrained Christoph Waltz, as a villain who is wearied and hollowed out by his villainy. Then there is the sheer quality of the splendid team surrounding Craig: Ralph Feinnes, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear are all distinguished theatre actors, who've all played Hamlet. They give a lot of bang for their buck, especially Whishaw, who has more to do in this movie than he had in the previous one. Naomi Harris as Moneypenny lacks her colleagues' theatrical chops, but she is bright and perky, evidently living in a more real world than either of her predecessors in the role.All in all, it's not bad, in fact it's pretty good, but once Craig leaves I doubt whether they'll be able to maintain the kind of complexity he's brought to the role. Nor will it be possible to go back to the crude sexism of earlier incarnations. Is this, then, the end of the line?",6,2,8,9 November 2015
Moon," High quality
","A number of familiar science-fiction tropes - space out-station, lone astronaut, smooth-voiced robot, suspect employer with an apparently green agenda - might lull you into thinking you know where this movie is heading, but the story and the excellent screenplay wriggle around enough to shake you up. What confirms MOON as high-quality entertainment is that it holds up very well even when you know the plot, as I discovered watching it again on DVD last night.Budgetary considerations probably determined the choice of miniatures for most of the exterior scenes. They seem to me to be the only weak spot of the film. Although they are well executed, their artificiality is in stark contrast to the believable interiors. There's compensation, though, in the form of other photographic effects which are extremely impressive.The heart of the film is an astonishing, virtuoso turn by Sam Rockwell, who deserved every award going but who had to be content with admiring reviews. If you're unacquainted with the work of this superb actor, then MOON is a great place to start. If you're a fan, you'll have seen it already, but never mind - see it again!",8,1,4,29 July 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," surprisingly good
","I was told that this was a reboot of an old franchise, but as I hadn't seen the previous movies this was all new to me. To be honest, I wasn't expecting it to be an intelligent piece of science-fiction. To my surprise, that's exactly what it turned out to be, as well as being noisy, violent, fast-paced, brilliantly edited, full of dark humour and, on the whole, well-acted. Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and a barely recognisable Nicholas Hoult are certainly excellent in the leading roles. The production design, costumes and make-up are all superbly realised. The two-hour running time flew by. The ending was perfect. All in all, I enjoyed it a lot.",9,1,7,13 November 2015
Macbeth," What bloody man is that?
","A visually impressive, intelligently adapted, atmospheric version of a very famous play. Michael Fassbender is stunning in the title role. What an actor he is! Brutal and sensitive, cruel and caressing, he handles the verse effortlessly, the fights viciously, and he radiates a huge wattage of charisma. He and Marion Cottilard make a convincingly sexy couple. She is not obvious casting - usually the role is the province of more steely performers. All the same, she makes a success of it, forceful in the electrically effective banquet scene, and touchingly melancholy as she drifts into the deep depression of her mad scene.The supporting cast is terrific, the technical side superb, the score by the director's brother mesmerising. I have a couple of quibbles: the emphasis on interiority makes the pace feel insufficiently varied, and so much close-miking gives the impression that too much of the text is whispered. But on the whole this is a bravely envisioned, powerfully acted movie.",8,20,32,29 September 2015
The Birds," The Last Masterpiece
","Although not his final film, this was Hitchcock's final masterpiece, full of fascinating cinematic ideas, some realised better than others, but considering the difficulties he set himself in this movie, well before our time's all-pervasive CGI, most of the hundreds of trick shots work out amazingly well.The brittle female lead was given to a strangely brittle first-timer, who acquits herself well - certainly a great deal better than she did in her (and Hitch's) next picture, MARNIE, in which the title character's complexities eluded her grasp. Melanie Daniels in THE BIRDS is much less of an acting challenge, although the role proved to be an endurance test, especially in the infamous, dazzlingly edited final bird attack.The rest of cast do sterling work, with a substantial contribution from Jessica Tandy and a noteworthy one from Doreen Lang.The element of the film that still feels wonderfully experimental is the soundscape of bird screeches, wing flaps and tweets. Way, way ahead of its time.",9,11,19,8 August 2014
The Martian," technically excellent
","Ridley Scott has a great eye for fashioning self-contained worlds, evidenced in this movie by convincing depictions of both the confines of a spaceship and the vastness of a planet. THE MARTIAN is solidly entertaining Hollywood fare. How much you enjoy it will be determined to a large extent on whether you're happy to pass a lot of time watching Matt Damon, who is at the centre of it. He's improved as an actor over the years. Pretty dismal in THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, he was impressive in BEHIND THE CANDLEABRA, and has some fine moments here. The sheer size of the role might even attract an Oscar nomination. But there's something about him I don't get, a hollowness in him somewhere, a lack which doesn't exist in actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Leonardo DiCaprio, who fill the screen with sheer presence, just as De Niro and Pacino did before them, and Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Spencer Tracy...the list is long. Damon has his moments, more than he used to, but he's not in the same league.Provided you can live with that, and some of the clunky dialogue, you'll have a good time with this technically excellent movie.",6,9,94,25 September 2015
V for Vendetta," On the eve
","I watched this movie on the eve of the inauguration of the 45th President of the USA. It wasn't hard to connect the content of the movie, based on Alan Moore's dystopian series of graphic novels, with fears for the future. I guess that's a sign of the filmmakers' seriousness of intent.Sure enough, V FOR VENDETTA gets off to a great start, full of action and mystery. As the story progresses, however, the excitement peters out, as it does in the Wachowskis' THE MATRIX trilogy, bogged down in heavy-handed portentousness.Natalie Portman works hard and effectively in the leading role of Evey Hammond, with Hugo Weaving doing his best to make a credible human being out of the eponymous man in a Guy Fawkes mask. A who's who of character actors, led by the perpetually pained Stephen Rae, toil away earnestly in support.The film's fatal flaw is that it assumes the majority of people are liberal at heart, and will rise up to oppose right-wing oppression. We just have to take a look at what's happening as I write this. In both the USA and Europe, democracies are turning their backs on liberal values. The demagogues are winning. The moral is, don't rely on the movies for up-to-date political analysis.",4,2,9,20 January 2017
