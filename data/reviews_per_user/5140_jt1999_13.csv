Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Crap.
","This is a complete load of horse***t masquerading as a movie.  Tedious, talky, derivative, full of itself.  Not much different from Tarantino's other films.  But at least 'Vol. 1' was a load of finely polished crap.  It may not have been profound, but at least it was entertaining.  At times.The problem with Tarantino is that he falls in love with his own cutesy dialogue, then refuses to cut it.  The final scene -- the supposedly climactic battle with 'Bill' -- was beyond disappointing, beyond anticlimactic.  Two sad and pathetic human beings trying to talk tough, cliche after cliche, putting the audience to sleep in the process.  Why talk at all?What we have here is an actress standing in for a director (they look like brother and sister to me), acting out the director's revenge and bloodletting fantasies, demonstrating in the process the director's infantile contempt for humanity, his disregard and contempt for human life, and his reliance on other people's ideas in the absence of his own.  The 'Fistful of Dollars' soundtrack being thrown into the mix merely reminded me of the great Sergio Leone, the great Clint Eastwood.  When I heard this great music, 'Titoli,' I believe it's called, at a packed midnight showing at the Cinerama Dome last night (and I consider screening this adolescent wank-fest at the Dome a total sin), I felt sad, thinking: this is what we've come to, this is what movies have deteriorated to: idiotic rehashes and 'homages' to great and serious filmmaking of the past.
The film-noir credit sequence at the end was stupid, overlong and completely inappropriate.  The 'Q' and 'U' credit made me want to puke.  The final outtake of Uma demonstrated once again the sheer pointlessness of the entire thing.'Let's do it again,' she says.  Another take?  Hopefully not another movie.
I know Quentin; he seems like a nice guy.  And he's a damn good filmmaker, to a degree.  But he's an overgrown kid -- and a bloodthirsty one at that. Maybe he's a little bit retarded.  Maybe some day he'll grow up.  Maybe someday he'll actually put his creative energy into something that matters.

The Hunger Games," WHAT hunger?!?!?!
","Someone want to explain to me the title of this pitiful snore-fest? ANYONE -- I dare you! Answer one simple question that should be so obvious it's ridiculous: What the hell has HUNGER to do with the PLOT???!!! They're not fighting over food...they're not trying to FIND food... But maybe I'm not supposed to understand. Maybe I'm supposed to read the book to understand. Just like 'Seabiscuit.'But that's just the tip of the pathetic iceberg. Definitely hard to know where to start the postmortem on this turd...but let's begin with the camera-work.. and I use that term loosely. For years, the Shakicam style -- jerky, hand-held zooms and sudden, erratic pans (not to be confused with good, hand-held documentary work) has gained popularity in both movies and television. It probably started on TV shows such as'NYPD Blue,' then later, 'The Office.' I guess the idea is to simulate documentary filmmaking, or reality filmmaking, or whatever the hell they call it these days. Movies like 'Cloverfield' and 'Blair Witch Project' used this style to convince audiences they were watching a home movie. Fine -- they made their point.But somebody want to tell me WHAT THE HELL HAS 'HUNGER GAMES' GOT TO DO WITH A HOME MOVIE SOMEONE SHOT WITH THEIR CAMCORDER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!What was Gary Ross trying to prove? It can't have been Tom Stern's fault (Eastwood's current favorite cameraman). He's been shooting extremely steady shots, from tripods, for years. You know, normal scenes you can actually follow that aren't a blurred, frantic jumble of swish pans and out-of-focus abstract images. The only explanation is that Ross, a middle-aged guy with absolutely NO connection to the average teenager or 20-something, must have figured this was the way to play down to the demographic that loved the book. The shaky 'reality' look is the only way to be 'hip' -- and show teens this is really their movie, part of their generation, part of their reality-TV/camcorder/mumble-core/Internet upbringing. Right?!?Wrong. What an awful, misguided miscalculation. For this disastrous decision alone, Ross should be banished from the DGA. Strung up and publicly tortured. Maybe required to suffer through his own 'hunger' game (whatever the hell that means -- I'm still not sure).I won't go into the how stupid and clich√©d the script is, how it rips off 'The Running Man' and 'Westworld' and 'Rollerball'... or how the idiotic, contrived 'happy' ending with Catnip Whatever and her cross-eyed, pseudo boyfriend hammered the final pitiful nail into the coffin of this pitiful attempt at cashing in on a book series by launching a money-making movie 'franchise.'Let's just say this putrid waste of celluloid is an embarrassment to the world of cinema and a permanent black mark that will never be washed off the once-opulent silver screen.",1,13,16,23 July 2012
Shutter Island," Who the hell is in chahge heah, anyway??!!
","Hard to believe the great Scorsese had anything to do with this laughable stinker.Even harder to believe the great Thelma Schoonmaker cut it!There are many terrible things here: the direction, the acting, the music. But far, far worse than any of them is the editing.The editing is absolutely atrocious. It so overwrought, so desperate to make the scenes succeed, so completely contrived and overdone that it almost defies description. And no, I'm not talking about the jump-cuts or continuity breaks. I'm not talking about ANY of that. That I can deal with. Some of it I even liked.What I'm talking about is the Academy Award-winner's complete and total inability to edit a simple dialogue scene with cuts that tell the story.It's as if she's lost every single ounce of talent displayed in 'Goodfellas'... or 'Raging Bull'... or 'Casino.' Just about EVERY SINGLE CUT is wrong... arbitrary, poorly timed, ill-advised, non-sensical.I just watched a 40 year-old episode of 'Night Gallery.' A 60--minute TV show they cranked out once a week. What a wonderful pleasure to see good, effective, unpretentious editing!!!!!! Editing that serves the story. Editing that's almost invisible. Editing that's just about unbeatable.And that was 1970.R.I.P. for now, Thelma. You had it once. You were great.....TRULY great.. You made Marty's scenes jump to amazing, thrilling, exciting life. There was simply NO better editing on display in 1990 than in 'Goodfellas.' Simply superb.Now, alas, the magic is gone. Your cutting in 'Stutter Island' or whatever the hell it is, kills every bit of dramatic potential this hopeless turkey ever once had. Which of course is not saying much!Yes, you had it....and now, dear soul, you've lost it. It's gone. I can only hope that maybe, someday, God willing....you'll get it back.",1,13,25,4 July 2010
Lost in Translation," 'Lost' is right
","This is a textbook example of how a film with a good first act can completelycollapse during the critically important second act -- and never recover. Sofia Coppola's minimalist 'romance' desperately tries to distance itself from its more traditional, romantic forbears ('Brief Encounter,' 'An Affair to Remember,' 'Summertime,' etc.)  In so doing, Coppola effectively torpedoes what might have been a memorable, slice-of-life relationship picture (a little more Woody Allen and a little less Antonioni could have helped), winding up with a sterile, often dull portrait of two lost souls searching for some sort of connection.  Sure, she may have avoided sentimentality -- but she also missed out on emotion, on magic.  On passion.  (See Paul Thomas Anderson's'Punch-Drunk Love' for a great example of how to incorporate all three.)The trouble begins with the opening shot -- an unflattering angle of our female protagonist, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) that director Coppola evidently hoped would launch her picture in an un-glamorous, European, Godardian way.  But what's the point?  Introducing the female lead by showing her ass?  If a guy had done it, he'd be labeled 'sexist.'  But a woman? No problem.  The more ass shots, the better -- and in this film, there are quite a few.After this artsy-fartsy beginning, we're introduced to Bob Harris (Bill Murray). With scant dialogue and many sad-eyed looks, we get the basic picture: unhappy American actor goes through the motions of promoting Japanese booze to make a buck.  In other words, he's sold out (the premise possibly inspired by Woody Allen's hilarious vodka ad bit from the '60s) -- the artificiality of his assignment echoing the superficial qualities of his life. (Simultaneously we see the shallow relationship between Charlotte and her phony photographer husband, John.)This is where the movie works.  In sparse, documentary style, Coppola gives us a sad portrait of Bob Harris: coping with a loud, Samurai-type director, being asked to impersonate the 'Lat Pack' for a still photographer.  He is truly in hell, and we feel for him.  Murray has never been more sympathetic.  The lounge lizard from 'Saturday Night Live,' the wisecracking Ghostbuster or any number of Murray's other wild, free-spirited characters are gone -- replaced now by an overly made-up, sad-eyed clown, a movie star past his prime, a depressed prisoner of fame, making dough instead of art, being coaxed intoridiculous poses while holding a glass of iced tea masquerading as Japanese whiskey.These moments, including one where Harris's wife faxes him a diagram of a shelving unit, are excellent, directed with subtlety and restraint.  The vapid conversations between Harris and his wife recall the 'Happy Birthday' scene from '2001: A Space Odyssey;' Bob is as bored with his wife's remodeling plans as Frank Poole is with his parents' news from Earth.  A quick glimpse of Harris glumly watching one of his old movies on T.V. -- in which the young, handsome Bob, speaking in dubbed Japanese, interacts with a chimp -- is priceless.  At this point, I truly believed I was watching a great film.Half an hour later, the movie -- like Harris's career -- crumbles. After a few chance encounters where Bob and Charlotte flirt tentatively at the hotel where they're evidently both staying (though this concept -- like many others -- is not clear), the realism ends, and -- bang! -- we're aware we're watching a movie.  These two strangers, who have never introduced themselves to each other (never mind exchanging room numbers), suddenly begin behaving like a married couple.  Bob strolls into Charlotte's room, whips off his tee shirt, and chit-chats like he's known her half a lifetime.  Did I miss something?  Suddenly, the hesitant strangers are talkative pals.   And just as suddenly, the movie -- for me, at least -- ends.The downward cinematic spiral continues with a hodgepodge of 'having-fun' scenes, filmed in sloppy, Dogme 95 style (amateurish handheld shots using existing light).   Many of these make no sense, among them: Murray breaking out of character and singing karioke, and Johansson donning a blonde wig (which disappears several scenes later).The rest of the second act is a complete disaster in which nothing happens. In the third act, we get a half-assed, boy-loses-girl bit: Bob is caught by Charlotte with a woman in his room (completely superfluous, causing no impact to the story whatsoever).  A character revelation where Bob tells his wife he's more interested in healthy eating than picking carpet samples is randomly thrown into the mix, nullifying its impact (see 'American Beauty' for a great example of how to do this type of thing properly)SPOILER WARNING***
The ending, which could have worked in a funny, bittersweet, 'Annie Hall' kind of way, falls especially flat.  Bob whispers something into Charlotte's ear -- but Sofia 'Cop-out'ola, in typical young-filmmaker-trying-to-be-profound style-- obscures the dialogue, so we're left to wonder what the hell he said, and what the ultimate point of their relationship was (maybe the line was so bad Coppola eliminated it, maybe she was merely trying to be artsy).
Either way, open endings are one thing, characters' final lines another. The audience is free to use its imagination to speculate on what will happen to Rick at the end of 'Casablanca' -- but not because 'Here's looking at you, kid' or 'We'll always have Paris' are obscured.  On the contrary, these lines are crucial to understanding Bogart's character, his emotional state, and they give the film its resolution.  Well, at least we can be thankful Coppola didn't work at Warner Brothers in the 1940s.'Lost in Translation' was a good idea for a film, but Sofia Coppola's inexperience as both writer and director shows.   Check out the final shot: after the credit crawl, there's a badly filmed, out-of-focus image of a woman waving to the camera.  It's the final nail in the director's home-movie coffin, once again leaving no doubt she's a novice.  If proving this point was Coppola's intent, she's succeeded.",2,2,4,4 November 2003
The Village," How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.
","I hate thee with all my heart and soul. I hate thee with an all-consuming passion, a terrible madness borne of shock and disappointment, lies and deceit, rage and damnable fury! I hate thee as I have hated none before. I burn as a never-ending fire in the deepest pit of Hell. And I thirst for revenge, for recrimination, and for the recoupment of my six pence. For thine is the foolishness, and the folly, and the awfully written screenplay that thou hast so miserably directed and produced!I hate thee in thine overall conceit, thy trickery and thy lies, thy foolish fear of prescribed colors (red). Most of all I hate thoust terrible dialog, much of the wretched squabble consisting of the phrase, 'those we dare not speak of.' Such foolishness, indeed! Because in point of fact, much of the entire scenario consists of witless fools speaking of such!I hate thee to thine very core, thine deepest marrow and beyond. I despise thy story from whence thoust came. I am sickened by the deceitful acting, and the foolish costumes, and the ridiculousness of the otherwise good player Brody, who is senselessly depicted here as rather a foolish clown! I am revolted that the other good players, the Hurt and the Weaver, these fine performers who were trapped into the folly and who surely knew not of what was to come! And I pray that with the grace of God, these pitiable persons, both elders and young ones, such as the Dallas Howard, will not suffer unduly hereafter due to their dreaded missteps into this pointless and misguided debacle!I hate thee thoroughly and finally. I hate not merely the whole, but every wretched portion. I hate each damnable frame, every putrid sprocket hole, each and every foolish and misbegotten conceit that was dredged from some dark and damnable place and foisted upon thy glorious silver screen! More than anything, I hate thee for this simple reason: that good and uncorrupted souls duly followed thou into thoust folly and were betrayed! Good and proper Cinema lovers, knowing full well their monies could never be refunded, trusted and waited, hoped and dreamed! But such was not to be. Because when thoust light flickered from thy projector, and when those damnable images burst forth and the foolish voices spoke, those blessed patrons were shocked and shamed beyond words! Time and precious money gone, hopes and fanciful dreams crushed. Good and proper minds laid to waste by such unfathomable nonsense and misbegotten folly! And more's the pity! that many of these trusting souls held thoust in highest regard due to thine past work, thine prior achievements, which in mine humble personal regard, may not have been divine masterpieces as such, but, it can be said, were good and entertaining diversions -- to a degree.But -- blast! With thoust latest execrable debacle, thou hast made a mockery of them all! Thou hast lured unsuspecting souls into thine theatre of pain and shattered their hopeful spirit! Dost thou arrogance and contempt know no Earthly bounds? Hast thou no shame!? Indeed -- for in perpetrating such degrading folly, no greater fool is revealed -- than thee!Thine pretentiousness overfloweth! Indeed, thine lack of ability and talent has never been more true or fully evident, and thine justification for ceasing all future moving picture production now and evermore I dare say has never been more plainly clear! And so I say unto you, sincerely and with full clarity of purpose -- on behalf of not merely myself, but of all good and righteous persons whom witnessed this unholiest of debacles: cease and desist, now and forever! Do so immediately -- if not sooner. For if such is not accomplished, I fear greatly for the future not only of all good persons, but the future of the Cinema itself! Alas! it may be too late already -- because those pitiable souls who suffered the boredom and the pain of the wretched awfulness have already paid the ultimate price -- and likely shall not be the same ever again!I, however, shall do my humble part to stop the madness: I will promise, in all truest candor -- from this day forward to the end of mine humble days -- to keep this dear prayer closest to mine heart: that none so wretched, none so foolish, and none such wasteful and awfully- written folly should ever spring forth upon this good Earth to desecrate the Cinemas, and blacken the hearts of Men!But whether such madness is again perpetrated, and whether the suffering shall continue, this I say this from the bottom of my most broken and tormented soul: I hate thee truly, madly and deeply, singularly and solely, and dare I say for all eternity -- or perhaps even longer.Amen.",1,14,29,16 December 2004
Jarhead," Takes your breath away... but so does a train wreck.
","'Jarhead' is further proof that a movie's success or failure ultimately comes down to the worth of the script, and that no matter how much excellent work goes into a picture -- from outstanding performances to fantastic editing to stellar photography -- no amount of skill and craftsmanship can remedy the fundamental flaws in the material.In many ways, 'Jarhead' can be equated to 'Heaven's Gate,' and Sam Mendes to Michael Cimino: when both directors have great scripts, they can make great movies (which does not make either of them great directors). 'The Deer Hunter' was a fantastic film, as was 'American Beauty.' But when these filmmakers got a little too cocky, they both began churning out inconsequential rubbish, like 'Road to Perdition' and 'Year of the Dragon' and now 'Jarhead.'With all due respect, this film has a lot going for it. Roger Deakins's bleach- bypass desert landscapes (though a little too overexposed for me) are quite impressive, Walter Murch's editing is seamlessly perfect, as always, and Thomas Newman's score -- which I'm sure no one else will mention or notice because it's so perfectly interwoven into the loud, rhythmically dominated soundtrack -- pretty much holds the whole thing together. And the performances -- from Jamie Foxx's no-nonsense staff sergeant to Jake Gyllenhall and Peter Saarsgard's raw marine recruits -- are uniformly excellent -- almost frighteningly naturalistic and often powerful.That said, a question must be raised: what is the point of this film? To show the frustration of warriors without a war? To enlighten us as to the stark differences between the military and the naive, back-home military expectations? To show the brutality and angst and raw machismo of young, unformed, insecure young men in their twenties worrying about their girlfriends and wives back home while serving in the 'Corp'?Well, fine -- this film does that quite well. But so have a dozen other movies, from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' nearly a century ago. to 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket' more recently (William Broyles' Jr's script lifts its drill instructor dialogue directly out of 'Full Metal Jacket,' incidentally.) And all of these films did so without the loud, tedious barrage of unstable, screaming young men hiding their fears and anxieties and sexual insecurities behind bellowing and hitting and mock homo-erotic behavior that grows tiresome long before the first reel has ended. So this film is gonna be bigger and badder and better because it's got more'grit' and 'realism' than those other war films (many of which are 'referenced' here, as we now say)? The more realism and grit the better, is that the point? Then why not focus the lens on a latrine for two and half hours? Why not show the real grit -- Marines taking a dump for twelve reels? Why not show them pissing and crapping and vomiting -- that's real, isn't it?Come to think of it, Mendes does give provide the audience with some outstanding bathroom activity -- but only five or six or seven or eight or nine times. As in 'American Beauty,' he never misses a chance to give the audience a real good view of urine, or someone urinating, or someone masturbating, or at least one or two or three or four naked men. Mendes gay? Nah! He's just keepin' it real!Well, this is a perfect example of what movie-making has devolved to in the second century of motion pictures. No wonder documentaries are so popular now. No wonder 'Reality TV' is the big thing. Audiences -- at least young, MTV- raised audiences -- have tired of standard plots, tired of unnecessary, extraneous crap such as stories and characters. What they want is realism -- and very little more. I've noticed that many ofthe IMDb reviewers have praised this film, mainly for its gritty atmosphere and 'real' approach. That's all well and good -- but I can get that in any number of excellent Gulf War documentaries, and better.Like 'Full Metal jacket,' 'Jarhead was based on a Marine's memoir. Unlike 'Full Metal Jacket,' the script for 'Jarhead' seems to have no ultimate point. In the end the picture gives us nothing new, nothing profound, nothing we haven't seen before and nothing truly disturbing or emotionally involving or thought-provoking (I guess we'll have to dig out the DVDs of 'Platoon' or 'The Deer Hunter' or 'Apocalypse Now' for that. What this film does give us, though, is a lot of noise and screaming and machismo, a mumbling, badly-enunciated 'Full Metal Jacket'-wannabe voice-over narration, and a pointless, confusing, unsatisfying ending. Stanley Kubrick, where are you now that we need you?!?",4,2,5,5 November 2005
The Machinist," How's it hangin', Travis? I mean Trevor.
","This is an intriguing yet ultimately unsatisfying film that seems to have been made by a copycat movie fan rather than a real filmmaker. It all seems oddly familiar -- from the disturbed, sleep-deprived young man staring into his coffee cup ('Taxi Driver') to the Bernard Hermann-style score ('Taxi Driver') ('Psycho'). Many of the scenes -- even the shots themselves -- seem to have been stolen from other, better, films ('Taxi Driver) ('Psycho') ('The Tenant'). Locker room reprises cafeteria ('Taxi Driver'). Strange solitary guy crossing parking lot to car recalls strange young guy crossing train tracks to apartment ('Eraserhead'). And check out the closeup of a hand grabbing a shower curtain ('Psycho')! But far worse than any of the plagiarized visuals is the plagiarized main character. Trevor Reznik -- a quiet loner who can't sleep and lives in a crappy apartment (sound familiar?) -- is such a carbon copy of Travis Bickle ('Taxi Driver') I wondered as I watched it whether Paul Schrader or Martin Scorsese were considering legal action. The name 'Trevor Reznik' even has the same number of letters as 'Travis Bickle.' Wait, don't tell me -- it's an 'homage,' right? (anything by Tarantino). The bleach bypass look ('Minority Report') ('21 Grams') makes for some interesting cinematography, and Christian Bale is worth checking out in almost any film. But ultimately nothing can save this dreary, convoluted mess for one simple reason: the main character is not sympathetic, and finally not worth our time or emotional investment.Even though Trevor is stolen from other movies ('Taxi Driver') ('Eraserhead') ('Repulsion'), he's missing some of the most important qualities that made those characters intriguing. We all know it's difficult to get an audience to cheer for a sullen, self-destructive character; we also know there will never be another Robert DeNiro ('Taxi Driver') or Anthony Perkins ('Psycho'). But doing a radical reverse weight-gain ('Raging Bull') just for the sake of shock is not the answer! The ironic result of this Method experiment gone awry is that Trevor is not only unlikable, he's physically repulsive -- and pushes us away rather than drawing us in.The secret to Travis Bickle was that he was essentially a child; his simplicity made him endearing. By the time he turned psychotic, we still loved him -- the way any parent would still worry about their disturbed son or daughter. Travis was also good-looking, had an interesting philosophy of life, and occasionally smiled. But Trevor is something else. He's someone we rarely identify with, someone we have little reason to care about (his bantering with the friendly waitress is the only time we come remotely close to warming up to him, but even then, it's all for nothing; unlike Travis, Trevor has no apparent designs on a woman, and therefore no goal or apparent desire -- she makes the first move, making Trevor passive rather than active. Bad story construction, bad character building!) For these reasons, the audience is never really given an entry point into the character. We may pity him, but we don't really care about him (the director obviously didn't understand this, and emphasizes the physical grotesqueness rather than trimming it down -- which is what a real filmmaker -- as opposed to an amateur trying to shock -- would have done in the editing room). Sure, we're horrified by his emaciated appearance, and it's sad and everything, but it's also over ('Night and Fog').On top of the physical problems, Bale's wild-eyed, Manson-like outbursts are so overblown and psychotic that we eventually side with the hooker who rejects him -- the exact opposite of what Scorsese so skillfully created with Cybill Shepherd's character, Betsy ('Taxi Driver'). And perhaps the only thing worse than being forced to watch physical deformities is being forced to watch limbs being severed by industrial machines. So naturally the director throws this at us, too, and for no apparent reason -- just more shock value (it ends up having nothing to do with the real story).Oddly enough, Trevor's physical abnormality has very little to do with the story, either -- it's basically just window dressing. It's not like Bale lost 60 pounds to shoot a sequel to 'Philadelphia;' it's not like the script was about someone starving to death. And from what I've read, Bale wanted to lose another ten pounds. Thank God someone stopped him! He'd probably be dead by now. And for what?! A third rate independent art house flick that most people won't see anyway?The unfortunate truth is that this little picture won't even generate a footnote in the film thriller/horror history books. Like a gnat buzzing around the great bodies of work of Hitchcock, Scorsese, Polanski and Lynch, it will quickly vanish into obscurity, receive zero Academy Award nominations this year (despite, or rather because of Bale's 60- pound weight loss), and that will be the end of it ('The Machinist').Better luck next time, Brad. And Christian -- next time you decide to risk life and limb for your art, maybe you should find a better script -- and a director who's moved beyond first-year film school mentality!",2,15,30,19 December 2004
28 Days Later...," Oh, my God! Where the hell is Chuck, now that we need him?
","This is a perfect example of just how far movies have deteriorated as we enter (can you believe it?) the second century of filmmaking.It also reveals how a limited director, such as Danny Boyle, can show some flair when working with a decent script and characters he understands ('Shallow Grave,' 'Trainspotting'), but stumbles badly when coping with underdeveloped and poorly conceived material such as this dead-on-arrival, no-brainer -- a dreary, glacially paced, uninspired rehash of your standard issue, B-movie, end- of-the-world, man vs. homicidal zombies science-fiction yarn (or should I say yawn?)The filmmakers were clearly lost.  The story, such as it, concerns a young man (Irish actor Cillian Murphy) who awakens in a London hospital (naked, for unknown reasons) to find the population decimated by a deadly virus.  He teams up with a young black woman (Naomie Harris), and together they find a man  (Brendan Gleeson, the only ray of light in this dreary sky) and his daughter (Megan Burns) living in a London highrise, decorated with blinking Christmas lights (apparently these lights attract only normal humans -- not murderous, infected ones).While exchanging mundane conversation that reveals nothing interesting or profound, the foursome conveniently hear a radio broadcast which inspires them to travel north to join other survivors.  In typical B movie style, they each follow the Stupid Rule in their own way (arming themselves with knives and bats instead of guns, driving into darkened tunnels, sleeping in the open where they are vulnerable to attack, etc.) and hiss or mumble their lines in terse, often unintelligable, English-accented snarls and grunts.  Things only go downhill from there.  In fact, this somber snorefest proves not only that comedies are becoming Dumb and Dumberer, but thrillers are in serious trouble, too. Scary as hell?  You better believe it.In the good old days of Hollywood, of course, an experienced director or producer would have ripped this script apart like a backfiring jalopy. He would have broken it down, analyzed it, improved its structure, cleaned it up, replaced its bad parts, and put it back together so it ran like new.  In short, he would have made sure the damn thing was revving like a Ferrari and whistling Dixie out its tailpipe before even THINKING about exposing a frame of celluloid (or in this case, an inch of videotape).  'What's this story about?' a director must continually ask himself.  'What do I want to say to people?'  And -- more importantly -- 'Is it really worth making?'  Hitchcock once turned down a project which others felt was worthy.  When asked why, Hitch responded, 'it's not necessary.'  My question, then, to Danny Boyle and everyone else involved in '28 Days Later...': 'Was this picture really necessary?'Movie making isn't rocket science, but it does requires a little common sense. Too often the forest is obscured by the trees during the long haul of getting a picture made.  But a good director has a vision, and he keeps it intact -- all the way down the line ('2001' and 'Blade Runner' are good examples.)  He or she knows exactly what he wants, and has sound answers to critical questions such as, 'What ideas am I trying to communicate'  What should the audience take with them when they leave the theater?  How will they be entertained and/o enlightened by this story?'  And perhaps most importantly -- in this era of been- there, done-that audiences -- 'What will I be giving them that they haven't already gotten a million times before?'Pretty basic questions, right?  But apparently none of them were asked during the writing of '28 Days Later...,' or if they were, they weren't sufficiently answered.What we basically have here is a slow-moving, empty-headed, European remake of 'I Am Legend'/'Last Man on Earth'/'Omega Man' -- with a little of 'The Stand,' 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Night of the Comet' mixed in -- but with none of the originality, logic, insight, topicality or especially humor of those pictures.  It's being advertised as an amped-up, action-packed, ultra-violent zombie pic.  Sounds great, right?  Would that it be so.  In fact the picture is such a grim and joyless pseudo-art house bore that from the beginning I wondered if I was in the right theater.  To add insult to injury, it's simplistic, sophomoric and morally and poliyically empty as well.  As opposed to a complex, well thought- out morality tale like 'The Omega Man' (or almost any episode of 'Star Trek') -- where we not only sympathize with both protagonist's and antagonist's point of view but get a powerful antiwar statement, too -- there seems to be literally NOTHING on Danny Boyle's mind except leaning out at the audience and yelling, 'Boo!'  The characters have nothing on their minds but basic survivial, and the zombies are of the insane, homicidal variety -- nothing more than foaming, rabid beasts that need to be killed ASAP.John William Corrington, on the other hand, adapting Matheson's novel 'I Am Legend,' gave the vampires of 'The Omega Man' not only personalities and intelligence, but a believable agenda as well: as victims of modern warfare, their mission was to return to a pre-technological age, before chemical and biological weapons disfigured them -- and sometimes Mathias's arguments made more sense than Neville's.  In this way, the structure of 'Omega Man' is exemplary: both hero (Neville) and opponent (Mathias) are well-matched, and both want the same thing: death for the other, and possession of the girl (Rosalind Cash). And of course the great Boris Sagal added his personal touch with unforgettable scenes of a lonely man quietly going mad (playing chess with his dead friend, hearing imaginary phones ringing) while trying to pretend he has a normal life couped up in his high-tech penthouse.  Heston is a master at this kind of role; he gave us another complex shell of a man in 'Planet of the Apes.'  (And don't even get me started on that piss-poor remake that Tim Burton actually passed off as a film.)To his credit, Boyle -- who never misses an opportunity to show his male actors nude (thanks a bunch, Danny) -- gives us a few good shots of deserted London. But because we care so little about our main character, and know nothing about him, these shots have virtually no impact, no point of reference. There's no point of view in this film; the directing style never really lets you know who you should root for, or why.  I wouldn't be surprised to hear one of the monkeys at the beginning of the film directed it (actually, that's not fair -- a monkey might have shown a little life).There's also a potentially nice sequence involving wild horses running free in the countryside.  This could've worked well in the hands of a good director; as it is it, the focus of the scene -- and the one memorable line -- is inexplicably given to a secondary character, Frank (Brendan Gleeson, excellent as always) -- reminding us for just a moment what this picture might've been like if Boyle had been sharp enough to give Gleeson the lead instead of Murphy.  Which brings us to one Cillian Murphy.Murphy, a young Irishman who girls probably adore, plays Jim, the young man who awakens 28 days later to find his world forever changed.  He's good- looking, and reads his lines well.  But the LAST thing you need from your lead in a picture like this is a good-looking guy who reads his lines well!  You need personality, you need complexity, you need -- Chuck Heston!!  This unfortunate bit of casting was the final death knell of the movie.  Not only is the picture lackluster and moronic (Gleeson raves uncontrollably for about a minute before someone announces 'he's infected'  Yeah, no kidding!), it's saddled with a main actor so dull and ordinary that thirty years ago I doubt he would've been hired as Vincent Price's or Charlton Heston's houseboy, let alone be allowed to play their parts.  And never mind that he's a decent actor.  TONS of decent actors do small parts in A films or big parts in B films every day, and for good reason: they lack the charisma or screen presence to successfully carry a major movie. Paul Walker's a decent actor, so is Thomas Jane.  Both good-looking guys, both capable.  But neither of them have the personality of a James Dean, or a Monty Clift -- and they never will.  Hiring Brendan Gleeson was the best casting decision Boyle made on this turkey -- and then he kills him off halfway through the second act!   Arrggghh!!!To be fair, Murphy was working with a handicap -- NO PART!  No character! Nothing.  Zip!  Talk about your underwritten roles!  The only thing we learn about Jim is he was a bicycle messenger.  That's it!!  We also see his parents clutching a picture of him as a child.  But who really cares?  I don't recall hearing any weeping in the audience.  Here's a guy who's completely ordinary. There's absolutely nothing special about him -- nothing -- he's just an ordinary Joe like you or I (maybe a little better looking).  And why am I paying ten bucks to see someone as ordinary as you or I?  That's what I asked myself for 112 minutes. The other three people in the theater were probably asking the same thing.Perhaps most problematic of all is that the film relies on a confusing, almost incomprehensible editing style during the action sequences, and the same narrow-shutter strobe effect that's become popular since 'Gladiator' and 'Saving Private Ryan' (though it's used to excellent effect in those films).  It also suffers from a third act 'Lord of the Flies' twist so hackneyed and out of place it might have been pieced together from discarded pages stuck to the bottom of a trash dumpster found outside Ed Wood's apartment about half a century ago.I realize what Boyle was going for -- he wanted to make an 'Omega Man' /'Night of the Living Dead'/'Assault on Precinct 13' for today's twenty-somethings who have (hopefully, God willing) never seen those great films.  And he wanted to do it using a Lars Von Trier, Dogme 95 style -- hoping this 'hip' approach would scare the hell out of people just by virtue of it seeming real.  (Not a bad concept if it was done this way, but it wasn't.  Unlike the Hi-8 camcorder approach used on 'The Celebration,'  '28 Days' -- shot by the same D.P. -- uses a PAL DV Cam for an almost-film look, and uses little handheld stuff.  It might as well have been shot on film in the first place.)And, like 'Blair Witch,' I guess the idea was that the realism would be heightened by the use of largely unknown faces.  And of course the zombies would be meaner and grosser and scarier than anything George Romero or Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ever cooked up in their stupid films.  That was Boyle's idea, and it's a damn fine way to make a movie. Right?Wrong!  FIRST you come up with an interesting character or two, an involving story that makes sense, a resolution that resonates, a theme that carries some weight, and ideally some sort of variation or improvement, if possible, on the kind of film you're emulating (avoiding ripping off the interracial relationship from 'Omega Man' or the waking-up-in-the-hospital-and-finding-everyone-gone scene from 'Day of the Triffids' wouldn't be a bad idea either) -- THEN you pile on your handheld video.  Your neat-o strobe effects and your with-it machine gun editing.  Your young, hip cast and your trendy contemporary soundtrack.Got it, Danny boy?  Starting to sink in?  Or should we take it again from the top, a little slower this time?POSSIBLE SPOILER*****Still, the film is considered a hit -- though it seems to be leaving the theaters pretty quickly.  And now I understand (egad!) a new ending is about to be added.  The original, darker ending Boyle apparently wanted in the first place (but that didn't test well) is about to be shipped to 1400 theaters across the country and spliced onto the last reel -- AFTER the credit crawl!  No, that's not a joke -- this is right out of the L.A. Times.  Beginning July 25th, this copycat clunker will have a final scene added, probably something nice and uplifting -- like Selena becoming infected, then Jim killing her, then himself. Something cheery like that.  Just exactly what we need today, I figure.  Which reminds me -- anyone know where I can get a gun?",2,1,3,17 July 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Best film of the year.
","This is the best picture of the year -- and Eastwood's finest since 'Unforgiven.' With 'Million Dollar Baby,' Eastwood has crafted a powerful yet tender story of ambition and remorse, of fearless fighters and broken hearts. Like 'Mystic River,' it's a tragedy -- but unlike 'Mystic River,' it packs an emotional wallop, punching into the viewer gradually, jabbing and hooking, weaving a bit, then slamming the audience hard with tragedy, knocking us out with a painful blow that never once rings sentimental, or false. Freeman is superb, as always, while Swank proves the genius demonstrated in 'Boys Don't Cry' was no fluke. Eastwood gives one of the most sensitive performances of his career. His score contains elements of 'Mystic River' and 'Bridges of Madison County,' yet seems perfectly suited to this, a completely different story. Tom Stern's moody cinematography and Henry Bumstead's decrepit sets are superb, often evoking a sense of the past, while never revealing a specific era. The fight scenes are among the most realistic ever filmed. All in all this Eastwood at his very best -- a true American artist who not only refuses to take off the gloves and leave the ring -- he simply gets better and better with each round. 10 out of 10.",10,38,69,16 December 2004
The Last Samurai," Pretty damn good.
","In the hands of a great filmmaker, 'The Last Samurai' could have been a great film.  As it is, it's a good film -- at times even a very good film -- and that's certainly no small achievement.Director Ed Zwick, of course, is no David Lean -- though 'Glory' and 'Courage Under Fire' are excellent films ('Legends of the Fall' is decent, while I consider 'Leaving Normal' one of the most mundane films ever made).   Here Zwick has attempted a traditional epic, and as with 'Courage Under Fire', depicts the horrors of war through a story of personal redemption.  Into this basic story he also injects themes of honor, pride, cultural clashes and technological change versus ancient tradition.Unfortunately, though, no matter how lofty the ambitions, the bottom line here is that in order to transcend the fairly standard hero-goes-on-a-journey-and- undergoes-change plot that we've all seen many times before, something pretty new and special has to be added.  It's a little late to rehash the old 'Searchers'/ 'Emerald Forest'/'Dances With Wolves' tale of the white man being captured by enemies and siding with his captors -- unless it's aimed primarily at people who have never seen 'The Searchers' or 'The Emerald Forest' (Arthur Penn realized this thirty years ago, and made the hero and the journey of 'Little Big Man' primarily comedic -- one of the main reasons the film works as well as it does).But in the post-Altman/Ashby/Penn era -- where nearly all films -- especially action/adventure films -- have returned to the grandiose seriousness of their 1950s counterparts (with little or none of the wit and satire that crept through in the 60s and 70s), it is therefore pretty much expected that we will get the typical grandiose, serious, high-gloss and overlong treatment all the way through, with very little humor.  And that's too bad.  Because a lighter touch could have gone a long way towards getting the audience more involved, and making Cruise's character more likable (indeed, the few humorous lines and scenes he has are among the film's most memorable moments; they humanize his character and endear us to him).And this is one reason 'The Last Samurai,' despite a bunch of probable Oscars, is going to miss its target of becoming a beloved classic, an action/adventure epic for the ages.  Just as Sam Mendes did with 'Road to Perdition,' Zwick has tried a little too hard to impress.  By pouring on the big, movie-type moments, he merely reminds us that he's emulating the greatness of classic directors, without ever equaling them.  Zwick -- as I'm sure he will readily admit -- is merely a student of great filmmakers such as Lean or Kurosawa; he will likely never be one himself.  The sensibility just isn't there, the life experience is missing.Cruise, similarly -- despite his talent -- will never be any kind of substitute for a Flynn or a Gable or a Bogart; Cruise is, after all, the kid from 'Risky Business' who danced around in his underwear.  The grinning jock with the big nose from 'Top Gun.'  The goofball pool hustler from 'The Color of Money.'  The difference between someone like Cruise (or De Niro, or any of today's top stars) and a complex personality such as Stewart or Fonda or Bogart or Gable is simply immeasurable.  The heart and soul of those great actors is somehow missing from most of today's performers.  So by making a film like 'The Last Samurai' in an old-fashioned, traditional way, it constantly invites comparison -- to great stars, to great directors, to the great age of studio filmmaking which, like the Samurai, is now gone -- never to return.The sad fact is that the great movie-makers are dying off, leaving us with imitators, not originators.  In the last ten years we've lost Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Wilder, Frankenheimer, Fuller.  In the last six months alone we lost John Schlesinger and Elia Kazan.  Is anyone really expecting to see some sort of masterpiece by a T.V. producer/director named Ed Zwick?!Still, 'The Last Samurai' manages to succeed in a number of ways -- mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes, shot in gory 'Braveheart'-style by the great cinematographer John Toll.  It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.Flashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai).  As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the sage warrior leader whom Cruise befriends.  A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to.  But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons.  Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa.  Or Lean.  Or Ford.All technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent.  Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud.   All in all, 'The Last Samurai' is an impressive production. And even if it  misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment.And whatever its faults, it's almost a miracle when a Hollywood studio today turns out something even a fraction this good.",8,99,206,24 November 2003
In Time," Sheer Torture
","Horrible in every way, this unintentional laugh-fest may have been financed and released because of Justin Timberlake in the lead... but whoever gave it the green light never bothered to ask if Timberlake could act.. or if he had any screen presence. He can't, and he doesn't. And no chemistry with Amanda Seyfried at all. I mean zero.I would not wish this film on my worst enemy. Getting through it is a grueling and painful endurance test. Its absurdity is matched only by its obviousness. More like an expensive student film than anything else, its pretentious script is filled with howlers and clunky, first-year film student so-called 'banter.' It's amazing the cast got through the takes without laughing. No wonder Ellison withdrew his lawsuit. He'd probably rather his time clock hit zero than be associated in any way, shape or form with this amateur-hour rubbish. Truly awful.",1,7,13,11 February 2012
The Departed," Violent, pointless junk. Sorry, Marty!
","Dear Marty:Well, you really blew it this time! Who the hell were you trying to please -- the teenagers who loved 'Reservoir Dogs?' The infantile sadists who consider 'Pulp Fiction' a masterpiece? What's the point in rehashing 'Donnie Brasco' or 'Prince of the City' and simply adding more violence? In fact, what's the point of the whole movie? That sooner or later we're all going to die, some of us by handguns? No kidding! 'The Departed' is not only one of the most dreary, pointless, and ridiculously violent films ever to shame the silver screen, it represents a new low for one of America's greatest filmmakers -- you, remember?! What were you thinking? That you needed the paycheck? That you wanted to work with some great actors and your fave of the moment, Leo 'he's no Howard Hughes' DiCaprio? Face it, Marty -- whatever you were thinking -- you should have thought harder! This is a cold, calculated, implausible film riddled with plot holes and worse, it has no heart. And what do we gain from it? Is there anyone out there who feels they've somehow benefited from it? If so, I'd like to meet them -- then recommend a good child therapist!Rather than a fascinating exploration of semi-psychotic behavior -- you know, the great films you used to make -- 'The Departed' has nothing remotely interesting to say. It belongs in the cinema of juvenile nihilism carved out by an ex-video store clerk back in the last century (which I thought -- at least HOPED -- audiences had outgrown by now). Marty, remember when Cassavettes saw 'Boxcar Bertha' and told you you'd spent a year of your life on a piece of s**t? Well, if he were alive today and saw 'The Departed' he'd tell you the same thing -- and with good reason! 'The Departed' isn't a Scorsese picture any more than 'Boxcar Bertha' was. It's a sensationalist Tarantino knockoff with echos of 'Goodfellas' and more than one Lumet film -- but with none of the humor, intelligence or compassion of any of those pictures. As far as the high-profile cast goes, Nicholson is no match for Pesci in the psychopathic sadist department, and Damon and DiCaprio, in all their one-note, tough guy splendor, are no match for Liotta or Depp. Sure, they're believable, but they're also deadly dull. Same with Baldwin, Sheen and Wahlberg, whose absurd character seems torn from a comic book. Vera Farmiga as the beautiful girl psychiatrist is sexy enough, but seems to be in a different movie -- one that actually has a connection to reality. The audience wants to connect with her, but since no one cares about any of the other characters (and unlike 'Goodfellas,' we're never quite sure WHO the main character is) we become as desensitized toward her as everyone else. Did anyone really care when Leo or Matt were killed? Did anyone shed as much as a tear? We CARED about Henry Hill, we CARED about Travis Bickle. You made us care, Marty -- With your genius, you made us love them! No one gives a rat's ass about Damon and DiCaprio. In fact I'd be willing to bet no one even knew Damon's character's name (Billy, was it?) until the end credits.Can you imagine, Marty, anyone watching one of your films in the 70s or 80s and not knowing Travis Bickle's name? Rupert Pupkin's? Jake LaMotta's? 'The Departed' (and I'm only giving it a rating of 2 because I love you, man -- plus Ballhaus's cinematography was great) shouldn't be grouped with the rest of your films any more than 'Bertha,' it shouldn't be allowed to tarnish the real Scorsese pictures like 'Taxi Driver' or 'Mean Streets.' To paraphrase one of your earliest efforts: it's just not you, Marty! More like the work of a cold-blooded punk who grew up on exploitation films and comic books (you sure Tarantino didn't ghost direct while you took a vacation?)Ultimately, it comes down to the script, and William Monahan (whoever he is) is no Paul Schrader, just as last time out, Josh Logan was no Mardik Martin. In order to be at your best, you've got to WORK with the best , right? So what's with all the 30 year-olds who haven't got a clue as to story structure,character development... who haven't a got a clue, PERIOD?!?All right -- relax and simmer down. It's not all bad news, I promise. And now that you've spent the last year of your life on a piece of s**t, it's time to get back on track, back to the stuff that matters -- like stories and characters people will actually care about (and I don't mean 'The Aviator'!) As Harry Cohn, Jack Warner or any great studio chief might have said back before accountants started greenlighting films: give us characterswe can love, stories we're fascinated by. Leave the comic book gunplay and Mexican standoffs to the 25 year-old Tarantino wannabes. You're too smart to be playing their brain-dead game, Marty! Too far along to stoop to their stupid level. And tell me this: what would John Huston have to say about this picture? What would Robert Aldrich? How about Howard Hawks? Or Stanley Kubrick?? You'velowered your standards, Marty, THESE are the people you've got to measure up to -- not a bunch of prepubescent Tarantino nerds who spend their lives on the Internet and playing video games!But don't worry, Marty -- I haven't lost faith. And please don't YOU lose faith, either. And if you have, think of the words of the great Lester Burnham, who in 'American Beauty' wisely said something we should all remember: 'It's never too late to get it back.'Love, a Scorsese fanatic (in spite of it all)",2,2,5,5 December 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The eagles have landed.
","This is a superb conclusion to an outstanding trilogy, adapted from what had to have been one of the most difficult-to-adapt literary sources, J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved 'Lord of the Rings.'Though viewer expectation makes it nearly impossible to live up to the revered written word, Peter Jackson has somehow pulled it off, transforming a beloved classic into a cinematic masterwork that can be appreciated by both die-hardTolkien fans and newcomers alike.  With 'Return of the King,' Jacksondemonstrates his mastery of not only large scale spectacle and visual effects, but of compelling drama and human emotion -- as George Lucas once did inanother century, in a galaxy far, far away.  Fortunately, what he and Spielberg have apparently forgotten, Jackson seemsto have pumping through his veins.  'Return of the King' is not only one of the best films of the year, but a high point in the fantasy/adventure genre, and a great tribute to both Tokien and the legions of loyal fans who carry on hislegacy.",Null,0,1,23 December 2003
