The King's Speech," Excellent and highly recommended
","My expectations before watching The King's Speech were not very high, because I expected to find one of those movies which are too light and absolutely inconsequential but at the same time adorned with the refinement and affected charm from the modern British art-house cinema. However, I took a very pleasant surprise with The King's Speech, because it ended up being a hugely entertaining, occasionally touching (without falling into the sentimentality) and very satisfactory experience.There are many historical elements in the screenplay from The King's Speech, like for example, the social scandal which altered the hereditary line from the English crown and the threatening shadow from the Nazi expansion which would end up provoking World War II, which brings a good context about the importance of the diction and rhetorical talents from the governors. But basically, The King's Speech is a fascinating tale about the 'bromance' between Prince Albert (1895-1952) and Dr. Lionel Logue (1880-1953), whose relationship begins based on the need from the first one to overcome his stuttering and is then extended to the mutual comprehension from their respective personalities. And I think that the story also works as an examination of the class differences in the United Kingdom, as well as of the monarchical traditions which have always provoked so much division between the people.And besides of all those interesting narrative levels, we have the great performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, which are absolutely credible and overflowing of passion without reaching the theatrical exaggerations we occasionally find in period films. As their respective characters' wives, Helena Bonham Carter and Jennifer Ehle also bring excellent works. And I also liked the performance from Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill (1874-1965) very much...I have always thought that this actor was born for this character, and after seeing his short performance in this movie I confirmed that, so I hope that if one day someone decides to make a Churchill's biography, they choose Spall.Many period films put the emphasis on the decorations and costumes, but The King's Speech is more interested in examining the psychology from its characters and their emotional growth. So, whoever goes to see this film expecting to admire lavish dances from the royalty or monarchic protocols will feel disappointed, because most of the story is developed into offices, cabins and a consulting room. However, that does not avoid The King's Speech from being visually impressive, thanks to cinematographer Danny Cohen and production designer Eve Stewart, who bring unique colors and features to every scene, emphasizing every single visual detail in order to enrich the sober style from the narrative. The only fail I found on The King's Speech is that there was a brief moment which was a bit dull to me; however, that does not avoid me from enthusiastically recommending it as an excellent film which is absolutely deserving of all the acclamation it has received so far.",9,0,2,19 February 2011
Moneyball," Very entertaining, and a pleasant surprise
","I tend to watch the films about sports with some reluctance, because that is not a subject I am interested in, and as a consequence, I do not know many things about it. So, if a film deepens too much into the rules or History of some sport, it is more difficult for me to 'plunge' myself into its narrative. And that is exactly what I was afraid of before watching Moneyball, not only because it deals with baseball (a sport I do not know practically anything about), but also because it is focused on its coldest and most inaccessible part: the statistics, the negotiations and the insides of the management of a professional team. To my surprise, the film ended up being very entertaining, perfectly accessible and even emotive.The subject Moneyball deals with might sound dry, but co-screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian expertly combined the intellectual aspect from the story with the emotions of the classic sport story, in which a 'loser' is ready to face unimaginable obstacles in order to reach the triumph...or at least trying it. The fact that the story is developed in meeting rooms, locker rooms and offices does not make it less interesting, even though director Bennett Miller certainly knew how to offer us some tense moments during decisive baseball matches.However, there are a few moments in Moneyball which feel a bit longer than they should during the very beginning. Nevertheless, the movie improves when Jonah Hill comes into scene, and his excellent chemistry with Brad Pitt takes the control of the narrative. Pitt himself brings a sincere and detailed performance, avoiding unnecessary sentimentality, but credibly expressing emotion whenever it is necessary. Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as the pragmatic trainer Art Howe, while Kerris Dorsey brings an adequate performance as the main character's daughter and Chris Pratt is quite funny in his role.In conclusion, I do not think Moneyball is a great movie, but I surprisingly liked it pretty much. My favorite film about baseball keeps being A League of Their Own, but that does not avoid me from recommending Moneyball as a very competent sports drama, which is well written, solidly acted and presents the adequate balance of suspense, emotion and drama in order to leave us satisfied.",8,0,1,15 December 2011
The Avengers," Very entertaining, but not great
","I have liked the comics from an early age, but it wasn't until I was 10 or 11 years old when I started to systematically collect them, following specific titles and 'plunging' myself into the respective mythologies from Marvel and DC (I have never been never been an 'exclusive' fan of some publisher). One of the first comics I took seriously was The Avengers, because Stan Lee already knew that the secret to capture the readers wasn't on the cosmic battles and colorful disguises, but on the examination of the vulnerable and human side of the characters. The Avengers was the perfect medium for that, because it put together a group of superheroes with very different ideologies and personalities, so that their mere interaction was as entertaining as their fights against villains and other threatens. Fortunately, director and screenwriter Joss Whedon comprehended that fact, and as a result, the film The Avengers is very entertaining.In The Avengers, Whedon wrote a generally well balanced screenplay in which he re-introduced the characters, justified their alliance and put them to fight as a team in one of those cosmic threatens suffered by New York with such a frequency. I said 'generally well balanced' because the screenplay makes some stumbles and has a few weakly developed characters. To start with, Loki feels like a bland villain; his methods and his motivation aren't consistent to what we had seen in the comics, in which he was a formidable and malicious manipulator (after all, he's the archetypal 'trickster'). I also found the 'Heli-carrier' sequence, in which Iron Man and Captain America try to repair an engine during 15 minutes, a bit weak...it feels like a poor excuse to insert an apparatus action sequence. And the other problem from the screenplay is that we don't know practically anything about the character Clint Barton. Fortunately, it was interpreted by Jeremy Renner, who is such a good actor that he can display his character's nature and his relationship with the other members of the team with just one expression; but even like that, I would have preferred the sacrifice of some gratuitous action scene in order to bring that character more dimension.Those fails are mainly noticed during the first half of The Avengers, in which the pieces of the story are being accommodated. For the rest, this is a very satisfactory and entertaining (and unexpectedly quite funny) culmination of the 'cinematic universe' Marvel had been building since the film Iron Man in 2008, and it was very pleasant to finally see the seeds which had been planted in that film harvested. As for the actors, I don't have any complaints. When I wrote the review of Captain America: The First Avenger, I complained about the fact that Chris Evans hadn't been able to evoke the gravity of Captain America, but fortunately, he corrected that weakness in The Avengers. Chris Hemsworth also brings a perfect work as Thor. Robert Downey Jr. shows a lot of enthusiasm and conviction as Tony Stark/Iron Man, while Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk also bring solid performances.In my opinion, the best moments from The Avengers were the dramatic ones, as well as the interaction between the superheroes. However, that doesn't avoid the action scenes from being exciting. Their best attribute is that they are always perfectly clear. In conclusion, even though I wouldn't consider it an excellent film, I had a very good time while watching The Avengers, and that is already more than enough to make it worthy of a recommendation.",8,9,20,28 April 2012
Black Swan," A fascinating and unique film
","Something the films directed by the great Darren Aronofsky have in common is the obsession. Independently from what the plot is about, we can be sure that the axis of the story will be the obsession which is devouring a person's life, either if it is in the shape of an impossible mathematical formula (Pi); the addiction (Requiem for a Dream); the eternal love (The Fountain); or recovering past glories (The Wrestler). Now, his most recent film Black Swan follows that thematic tendency, at the same time it brought me a unique and fascinating experience.I think that Black Swan is a movie which will provoke divisions between the spectators, because while some ones will acclaim it as an excellent film full of deepness, symbolism and emotion, other ones might consider it as an absurd melodrama due to the visual tricks Aronofsky uses in order to portray the unstable mind from the main character. Personally, I belong to the first group, because even though there were a few occasions in which I found the visual tricks to be a bit excessive, I was 'hooked' on the film from the very beginning until the end. And something which helped me to that is the extraordinary performance from Natalie Portman. To put it simply, she brings one of the best performances I have ever seen (I am not exaggerating). From the first seconds of the movie, Portman establishes the attitude and personality from her character with an incredible clarity and precision, and as a consequence, we do not need too much dialog or 'exposition' in order to understand the hard way she took in order to lead to the New York Ballet, the difficult situation she lives at her house, and the damage the suppression of emotions and natural instincts in her search of perfection provoked on her. Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder, Mila Kunis and Barbara Hershey also bring solid performances; however, they get a bit darkened by Portman's monumental work.The only time I have seen ballet live precisely was a staging of Swan Lake, and I was left impressed by the elaborated scenic effects the show was adorned with (I particularly remember a lightning which announced the entrance of an evil sorcerer). Black Swan also employs many special effects, but most of them are subtle and almost invisible, something which makes them to be more disturbing because we are never really sure if we really saw what we think we had seen. That is the general atmosphere from this movie...an ambiguous balance between fantasy and reality, not as opposite extremes, but as fusion of experiences which have to be interpreted by every spectator in order to draw conclusions. That nightmarish tone might be the reason why some people consider Black Swan to be a horror movie; but I think that it would be a mistake to typecast it into a specific niche, because its ambition is superior to belonging into any formula or genre.And I think that it is not convenient neither to 'understand' Black Swan, or to separate the real scenes from the ones which (maybe) take place into the main character's mind, because I feel that the purpose of the movie is for us to feel the confusion, anguish and terror the main character experiences under the intense pressure the different aspects of her life provoke on her, from the horribly competitive world of professional ballet, to the anxiety she feels at her house due to her own insecurities and the influence from her suffocating mother. Aronofsky and Portman can make us 'live' that situation with excellent results, and I enthusiastically recommend this movie, because despite not being perfect, it definitely is a great movie.",9,3,5,17 February 2011
Frost_Nixon," Undoubtedly,the best film from 2008
","Although it has been acclaimed all over the world with various awards and nominations (including the one to the Oscar as Best Picture),I went to see Frost/Nixon with some doubt about its social or political relevance.After all,Richard Nixon died fifteen years ago and his life as well as the Watergate scandal have been examined on movies (from the biographical drama Nixon to the comedy Dick,without forgetting the most famous one,All the President's Men),books and television and it seems there is not too much fresh material which does not limit to recycle what we already know.But,after watching this movie,I just forgot about all the prejudices I had before watching it because Frost/Nixon is an extraordinary movie whose main point is not examining the multiple mistakes Nixon has committed,but to examine the man behind the scandal and at the same time,offering a fascinating behind-the-scenes look to the interview that,for many people,represented the judgment Nixon has never had.Frost/Nixon is based on a play written by Peter Morgan,and the author himself made an excellent adaption.Morgan did not intend to take a play to the cinema but to transform the play into a movie.In other words,Frost/Nixon never feels as a filmed play,but as a movie.Frank Langella made a magnificent work as Nixon and he completely deserves all the acclamation he has received.Michael Sheen,Oliver Platt,Sam Rockwell,Matthew Macfayden,Kevin Bacon and Toby Jones also bring excellent works because they completely become on their roles,so they never seem to be acting.Ron Howard made an extraordinary work as a director.He has an irregular career and although he is a talented director,he has shown a doubtful criterion for choosing some projects (like,for example,The Da Vinci Code and The Dissapearences).But in Frost/Nixon,Howard proves all the talent he has when he works with good material.Although the story of the film is a little bit static,Howard found the way to make it enormously entertaining,interesting and not boring at all.I honestly think Frost/Nixon is the best movie of his career.By my point of view,this is the best film from 2008 (from what I have seen).Frost/Nixon is a fascinating and magnificent movie thanks to its interesting story,brilliant performances and excellent direction.I completely recommend this movie because this is certainly cinema of the best quality.",10,1,3,19 February 2009
Howl's Moving Castle," Good movie,but it is not so good as the previous Miyazaki's films
","I always like the films that Hayao Miyazaki does,because they are real art cinema.Howl's moving castle is a great film,but it is not as good as the previous Miyazaki's films.I think the movie could be a little shorter.But like I said before,the movie is great and it has something really strange in other kids movies:it is unpredictable.The movie is very fun and the little dog is hilarious.The scene in which Howl and the girl fly is excellent.If the movie would be shorter it could be a masterpiece like Princess Mononoke,the best Miyazaki's film.I recommend this film,because it is fun for kids and for their fathers and this is real art cinema.",8,0,2,2 April 2006
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A very interesting juvenile drama
","In this century, there has been a fracture in the juvenile cinema, dividing it into two different cinematographic styles: on the one hand, we have cheap vulgar comedies made straight-to-DVD, dedicated to the classic 'teenagers looking for sex' formula. And, on the other hand, we have 'indie' melodramas which take the emotional turbulence provoked by the end of childhood and the beginning of adult age seriously (such as It's Kind of a Funny Story and The Art of Getting By). I personally prefer the juvenile films from the '80s and '90s, in which both aspects were combined (Weird Science, Clueless); but anyway...if I have to decide, I definitely prefer the 'indie' side because those movies tend to be better written, acted and directed. What takes me to The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a very good juvenile drama which offers us realistic characters trapped into an internal and external fight expressed with honesty and a solid emotional impact.It's risky to let a novelist write the screenplay and direct the film based on his novel, but in the case of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, novelist/screenwriter/director Stephen Chbosky made a good work in every aspect, starting by the selection of actors. I hadn't swallowed Logan Lerman in some previous occasions (The Three Musketeers -2011-, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief), but his work in The Perks of Being a Wallflower is extraordinary, carefully modulating his character's multiple facets in order not to make him look like a stereotype; what takes me to one of biggest pros of the film (and from the novel, I guess): the characters are complex and possess an own voice, rejecting the habitual labels of the genre, and as a consequence, we won't find the typical villain sportsman, virginal girlfriend, 'mean girls' or buffoon friends.Ezra Miller brings an excellent performance as a sensitive and very friendly young man despite not fitting into the obligatory school niches, while Emma Watson brings a perfect melancholic sensibility to her character. Nina Dobrev is totally credible as the main character's older sister, occupied into her romantic drama but still vigilant over her younger brother; despite having few scenes together, Lerman and Dobrev perfectly evoke the fraternal love/irritation dynamic. The adult characters are a bit generically written (starting by the anonymous paternal figures who only exist as a complement of the domestic environment), but I liked the performances from Paul Rudd and Melanie Lynskey.Nevertheless, the best element of The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the screenplay, unpredictable enough in order to keep our attention, but respecting the 'coming of age' structure which invites us to revive that complicated period in human life. On the negative side, I would mention the last 10 or 15 minutes, when the drama is suddenly incremented in order to bring us a dose of forced psychological conflict which wasn't necessary to complement the well raised narrative. Some people are saying that The Perks of Being a Wallflower is '21st century's The Breakfast Club', and even though I wouldn't agree on that, I appreciated its ability to portray the transition to maturity on a credible way, examining the fears and insecurity of getting into that unknown territory. In summary, I liked this movie pretty much and I consider it worthy of a recommendation, but I wouldn't put it into my 'hall of fame' of juvenile cinema.",8,1,2,29 November 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Great movie directed by Spielberg
","Steven Spielberg is a great filmmaker.He made false moves on his career and great movies.He made a lot of sci-fi films,historical dramas and he made some comedies.But his comedies(The Sugarland express,Hook,Always and 1941)were failures of critic and of popular opinion.They are the less known movies of his career and a lot of people forgot them.Maybe,they were too shallow or,simply,they were not funny.Catch me if you can is a comedy but it's way better than his other comedies and it had good popular opinion and critics and a lot of people know it and remember it.I have to say Catch me if you can is the best comedy of Spielberg's career.The best thing about this movie is that it is dynamic,interesting and very fun and funny.The script is very well written and the 141 minutes this movie has pass flying.Another great thing about this movie is that the film does not have a hero and a villain and I did not want to see one of the main characters as the loser.The ending is great.Leonardo Di Caprio is,no doubt,a great actor and here,he has a great performance.Tom Hanks makes an awesome performance,too.These two actors were ignored by the pathetic awards because they did not have serious roles but they deserved a nomination.The supporting cast is great,too but the best supporting performances are from Christopher Walken and Amy Adams.Walken is really perfect on his role and he had very well deserved Academy Award nomination and Adams has a role of teenager in love but she makes the character complex and memorable.Catch me if you can is a great movie.Rating:8.5",8,1,4,14 December 2006

Star Trek," An excellent entertainment
","When I was young,my holy trinity of TV series was composed by Lost in Space,Ultraman and Star Trek.When the time went by,I kept appreciating the first two ones because of their fast entertainment and the nostalgic factor...but in Star Trek,I found additional levels which made me to comprehend why the science fiction can express interesting ideas and provocative concepts in order to stimulating the imagination and waking up the curiosity of the spectator about the universe which rounds on him/her.So,I have to admit I am a 'trekkie' who has gone to conventions (without a disguise) and who has seen every movie and every single episode from all the series belonging to this franchise (by the way,my favourite one has been The Next Generation,and the one I have least liked is Voyager).However,I am not one of those fans who take their fanaticism to semi-religious extremes,studying the continuity of the Stark Trek universe and remembering every single detail.We do not have to forget that,more than anything else,Star Trek must work as an entertainment,and when its appreciation is replaced by academic precision,I think it looses one of its main virtues.I think we should take that attitude to analyze the new Star Trek movie,because it works wonderfully as an entertainment.This resulted to be an excellent film for many reasons.First of all,this movie is tremendously entertaining on every scene,so it never becomes boring.This movie does not get the narrative heights from the best moments of the saga,but I do not consider that as a fail...after all,the main intention from the movie is re-establishing the Star Trek universe for a new generation,introducing the characters,their motivations and the relationship between them,and the movie perfectly achieves that.The cast is perfect and director J.J. Abrams obtained amazing changes of rhythm,emotion and tone which,on some way,they do not alter the consistency of the story and of its characters.Besides of that,Abrams shows great talent for generating emotive moments and exciting action sequences.The only fail I found on this movie is that,near the ending,a situation has a forced solution.I will not reveal more because I may ruin the movie to some people.In spite of that,I liked this movie very much.Star Trek is an excellent entertainment,and it left me very satisfied.I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm,because I am sure you are going to have a great time with this movie,being or not being a 'trekkie'.",9,0,8,5 June 2009
Fury," Fury is an entertaining, but not very memorable, war film
","With so many wars available as an inspiration for modern cinema, I like the fact that World War II keeps being visited with quite a frequency, because it was the last conflict with perfectly defined 'good ones' and 'evil ones', and with a concrete purpose which wasn't guided by ambiguous economic goals or questionable political interests. What I don't like too much is that, in 21st century, I generally keep finding the same clichés of the films I used to watch when I was a kid with my dad, in which John Wayne or William Holden played brave soldiers who didn't only fight the enemy, but who also represented the noble and fair North American ideals of post- war world. The difference is that, back then, it was considered propaganda, and nowadays, it's considered art... or sarcasm, according to the spectator's criterion. Anyway, the point is that Fury is a clichéd and not very memorable war film, but nevertheless, I found it entertaining, mainly because of the solid performances. Brad Pitt brings a credible and charismatic work in the leading role, and he's well complemented by Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal. Fury employs the same characters and situations from old war films, but its representation of the combat displays in detail the effect of the bullets and explosions over the human body, as well as the degradation of physical and psychological conditions in the line of battle. But the blood and devastation don't feel morbid or gratuitous, but as a reminder of the price many people paid for the sake of freedom (or whatever we currently enjoy). So, Fury isn't an excellent or particularly memorable film, but it managed to keep me entertained, and I can give it a moderate recommendation mainly because of its adequate balance of drama and action and the good performances.",7,1,5,15 January 2015
Train to Busan," Busanhaeng
","Once more, South Korea borrows a concept of North American cinema, and brings us a lesson on how things should be done. After many years of generic and repetitive zombie movies (with a few honourable exceptions), we finally have a film with authentic substance, well developed characters and a positive and humanist message which transcends the horror of the zombie infestation. However, thinking about it well, the secret might be the fact that Busanhaeng isn't really a horror film, but an electrifying adventure in which the main danger (but not the only one) is the zombies... a similar strategy to the one of World War Z (with echoes of Snowpiercer), but less focused on the global disaster, and more dedicated to cultivate interesting characters whose challenges and relationships form the dramatic core of the film. Besides, Busanhaeng isn't as bloody as it seems while we are watching it. In retrospect, it surprised me to realize that there are almost no firearms, a bullet is rarely shot and the blood flow is kept to the minimum... nothing of 'head shots' or dismemberments, and barely a few bites with minimum gore. However, the impact of the attacks is undeniable, due to Yeon Sang-Ho's brilliant direction, whose ingenuity doesn't know any limits in order to orchestrate chases, escapes and situations of a big danger which flow organically without damaging the logic and realism of the premise. The characters of Busanhaeng cover a democratic range of ages, occupations and personalities: the financial executive who is only worried about saving his little daughter; a working class couple with a baby on the way; two students who are in love, even though they don't want to recognize it until their lives are in danger; an indigent who is more cunning than the other ones imagined; and, of course, the obligatory 'corporative villain'. Despite so many sub-plots, Busanhaeng never gets confusing, and much less boring, because it continually finds new ways to create suspense about the destiny of the characters. Nevertheless, to be fair, my only complaint against this movie is that unexpected decision which concludes the second act, in which one of the characters does something quite absurd I didn't find credible or justified. But, well... the consequences of that twist deliciously complicate the situation, and I still give Busanhaeng an enthusiastic recommendation as a zombie film which is tense, hugely entertaining and even deep, with a solid social commentary about the war of classes and personal responsibility which is rarely found in this type of cinema. In summary, Busanhaeng is the best zombie film I have seen in various years, and another sample of Korean talent improving North American formulas on the basis of creativity and emphasis on the humanity of the characters, regardless of the circumstances they go through. That's a valuable lesson for any cinematographic genre... but it works better in fantastic cinema, in which a strong connection to reality is indispensable.",9,15,32,11 December 2016

Inglourious Basterds," Interesting but very far from Tarantino's best
","I am a big fan of director Quentin Tarantino's work, but I took a huge disappointment with Death Proof, at the same time it made me see that Tarantino was not infallible as I thought he was before watching that film.Death Proof had been full of loooooong and horribly tedious sequences which had insipid dialogs and which did not lead anywhere.I found Tarantino's indulgence on that film to be unforgiven, because his obsession for making a tribute to the 70's cinema took preponderance over the narrative and his usually clear vision.So, because of that, I had a bit of distrust before watching Inglourious Basterds, another tribute to a genre ('Nazi exploitation') which was popular on previous decades but which was extinguished over the time for finally becoming into a historical curiosity, and whose films are more interesting for their anachronism than for their intrinsic quality.And although I enjoyed many 'Nazi exploitation' films, I did not think they are worthy of a rebirth.At least that was my perception before watching the film.After having seen it, I noticed that Tarantino's intention was showing two facets which coexist on the same movie; on the one hand, he wanted to make a cathartic film with plentiful violence and action; and on the other hand, he wanted to make a sober drama about the ideological conflict behind World War II.I think those two facets are not very well balanced, but they help to each other for finally creating an interesting and entertaining experience, but which is not very memorable after all.I will start with the complains I have with this movie.First of all, I think Tarantino urgently needs an editor or producer who can instill some narrative discipline on him.Tarantino has always been interested in creating juicy conversations, but he exceeded a little bit on that in Inglorious Basterds (although not as much as in Death Proof), at the same time that makes him loose the narrative focus on a few occasions.That was definitely an obstacle I had to completely plunge myself on an interesting story.Besides, I do not think the story was completely well planned; I think that the elements of action and violence were the least lucky from the movie, and that includes the 'basterds' from the title.And finally, I did not find Brad Pitt to be completely credible on his role.I consider him to be a great actor, but he honestly irritated me a little bit in here.Fortunately, Inglourious Basterds has various positive elements, so I finished liking it after all.The best element from this movie is the aspect of the espionage and conspiracy from the Resistance, thanks to Tarantino's solid direction and the excellent performances from a group of European actors, where the members who mostly stand out are Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz.So, in spite of its various fails, I liked Inglourious Basterds and I can recommend it as an interesting movie.It is definitely an enormous step forward of Death Proof, but it is very far from reaching the heights of Tarantino's best movies (Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, by my humble point of view).Clearly, Inglorious Basterds is one of his least achieved movies, but it entertained me anyway.",7,2,8,9 October 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
","If Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope was inspired by The Hidden Fortress, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story took the example of classic movies such as The Guns of Navarone and When Eagles Dare, in which a desperate group of individuals gets infiltrated into enemy lines in a mission of high risk... and also high reward. But that's not all. As part of a huge cultural (and, let's accept it, commercial) legacy, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story must complement its main story with strong bonds to the past and the future of the saga, integrating new characters in old situations and recreating classic settings with the most modern special effects, without losing the 'spirit' which defines and identifies everything related to Star Wars. Is it possible to fulfill with so many requirements while bringing a satisfactory film on its own merit? Fortunately, yes. Director Gareth Edwards and co-screenwriters Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy took a 'historical' passage of the mythology, and brought it quite an energy and vigor, leaving behind the idealized 'space opera' in order to face the physical and emotional challenges of a guerrilla conflict, in which the action might be less epic, but not less exciting because of that. The main cast is composed by various solid actors making a good work in their roles: Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Donnie Yen, Wen Jiang, Riz Ahmed and Alan Tudyk (of whom we only hear his voice). On the negative side, I think Weitz and Gilroy didn't invest enough time on the development of some characters (Bodhi Rook and Cassian Andor particularly); sure, I don't need a prequel of the prequel either to explain every small detail, but some more minutes of 'backstory' would have strengthened those characters while leaving their function inside the narrative clearer. As for the villain, the great Ben Mendelsohn brings a perfect work as a bureaucrat who became a megalomaniac. And, sure, we can count with multiple cameos, references and hidden jokes for the fans. Some of those 'easter eggs' seem self-indulgent whims, while other ones denote authentic ingenuity and love for the saga. I found Rogue One: A Star Wars Story satisfactory and very entertaining, but inferior to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which I received with so much taste after 16 years of resentment against the 'bad trilogy'. But anyway, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story confirms the viability of tangential 'spin-offs' of the main chronicle, increasing the opportunities to experiment with new perspectives... exactly like the 'Extended Universe' did so during many years in the shape of comics, novels, videogames and even TV series. They all enriched the saga, and now, we are starting to enjoy the same in the cinema. We are already in the right track; now, please don't let George Lucas get close.",8,2,10,16 December 2016
Coraline," Not great,but it's a very solid movie

I have three examples of that : the graphic novel A Game of You, the screenplay of the movie MirrorMask, and the short novel Coraline.And,thinking it well,the graphic novels The Books of Magic (with a male main character) and Death: The High Cost of Living (investing the oneiric world with the real one) could also fit on that category.But well...I guess we can ignore those repetitions if we consider them the as 'recurring subjects' from the author.If someone has won the right of rethinking Lewis Carroll's formula is undoubtedly Gaiman,whose perfect domination of fantasy and its perfect balance with the real world has brought us literary masterpieces like American Gods,Good Omens and The Sandman.I was thinking all that when I had finished watching the movie Coraline.This movie is not great but I could forget of any comparison with Alice in Wonderland because I had had a very good time with its simple but at the same time deep story,its emotive moments,its correct observations and with director Henry Selick's visual magic.I am very happy to see Selick finally getting recognition,after being unfairly ignored for his solid work in the film The Nightmare Before Christmas,which is considered for many people,as a director Tim Burton's work,when in fact,it was Selick's.Honestly,I think Coraline is superior to The Nightmare Before Christmas for the simple fact the original material is more ingenious and that,combined with Selick's bizarre sensibility,it gets an appropriate balance between eccentric humor and disturbing fantasy.Fortunately,that sensibility is not out of control in Coraline (at the difference of Monkeybone) because,at working with Gaiman's short story,Selick had to 'domesticate' his bizarre imagination and use it as a tool for telling the story.The result is very entertaining and with some creepy moments.I have two complains against Coraline.For one sight,some elements feel a little bit forced and out of place while there are a few moments in which the movie looses the focus of story.However,in spite of that,Coraline is a very solid movie which is not great,but it is very entertaining and I like to see a Gaiman's work very well adapted,specially after the disappointing Stardust.I recommend this movie with confidence because I liked it pretty much.",8,0,3,14 March 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Great parody to horror movies
","This movie is totally great and it is fun from the beginning until the end.This is a parody to horror movies(my favorite genre) and it is totally funny.The scene in which the zombies kill David is hilarious.Edgar Wright made an excellent film and I am very interested in watching more films from him.In the second half of the movie there is a great scene in which they are fighting with a zombie and you hear the Queen song Do not stop me now.The genre of the movie is a romantic comedy with zombies.That description sounds strange,but when you see the movie you know that it is the best description of the movie.I recommend this hilarious movie to fans of horror films.",9,1,3,13 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," It's not great but it's a pretty fun movie
","Pirates of the Caribbean:the curse of the black pearl is not a great movie,but it kept me fun.The production behind this movie is great.But the best thing I found on this movie is the script.I know it's not innovative,but it's well written with the unexpected twists and the surprises the movie has.The great Johnny Depp has an extraordinary performance as Jack Sparrow and putting him on that character was a great decision.He had a very deserved Academy Award nomination.Geoffrey Rush and Jack Davenport bring excellent performances,too.Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are very shallow on their characters.The battle sequences are spectacular but some of them are very long and some of them could have been edited off the movie.Another frailty is that,near the ending,there are some boring and redundant scenes which could have been taken out.Pirates of the Caribbean is not a great movie but it kept me fun.",7,0,2,13 December 2006
Oldboy," Great revenge movie
","The movie starts with a very violent scene which shows a man killing a guy.You do not know who are they and why are they there.That scene says that the movie is not for everyone.There are more violent scenes and much more graphic than that scene.They can disturb sensitive persons.Oldboy is a great movie and a very original revenge film.Chan Wook Park found a very original way to tell the so used revenge theme and I wanna see Park's other films like Lady vengeance,a movie with excellent rumors.I totally recommend Oldboy with the warning that it is not for sensitive persons.Rating:9",9,16,77,8 September 2006
The Secret in Their Eyes," A proof that excellent cinema can be made in Argentina
","I always have a bad predisposition against Argentinian movies, because they tend to be boring and pretentious.However, there are some exceptions, because films like Nueve Reinas, Tiempo de Valientes and El Secreto de sus Ojos are clear proofs that excellent cinema can be made in Argentina.The screenplay from El Secreto de sus Ojos is very well written, since it is simultaneously detailed and fascinating, at the same time it presents complex and very interesting characters.Juan José Campanella's direction is perfect, since he drives the movie at a perfect rhythm and he creates a memorable sequence in a football stadium.That scene is simply magnificent.And, as for the performances, they are also very good.The only thing I can say against this movie is that a few elements near the ending feel a bit forced.However, that is a minor fail.El Secreto de sus Ojos is an excellent movie, and the kind of film Argentina needs to have more frequently.I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm.",9,11,17,7 February 2010
Black Book," A great film
","After a great career of almost 25 years making low budget films with a lot of fascinating ideas(like Spetters or Soldier of Orange)in his natal Netherlands,director Paul Verhoeven moved to USA in 1987.I consider his career in USA also excellent (with the exception of Hollow Man).He made fascinating films with an extraordinary energy and with excellent scripts.The films were very economically successful but the people in general could not understand the satire Verhoeven put to that films.The films I'm talking about are Robocop,Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers.But,after the economic and critic failures of the criminally underrated Showgirls(I still defend this film)and the mediocre Hollow Man,Verhoeven backed to Netherlands maybe,to escape the pressure Hollywood gave him and to go back to his land.And,Black Book is the spectacular result of that decision.Black Book is a magnificent film.This film is a perfect combination between the traditional war films of the 50s with the sensibility of the modern epic films.This film took the classic formulas and it gave them new life.Obviously,Verhoeven did not want to do a typical war film where the Nazis are the villains who are defeated by the hero.His intention was to show the analysis of a real situation in which,sometimes,the villains show more humanity than the hero.Black Book is a lot more than a very fun adventure during the World War 2.The difficult decisions and the questionable ethic of the characters make of Black Book a complex and fascinating film.Black Book is a great film:it's enormously fun,it has excellent ideas,it does not have the solemnity this kind of movies have,it's complex,fascinating and,the best thing of all,it leaves the spectator thinking.All movies should be like this one.",10,5,8,30 April 2007
Pirate Radio," Not a great film, but very competent
","There are many movies which proudly pronounce the magic of rock 'n roll, but let's accept it, not all of them are good movies in the traditional sense.Although I liked the music, attitude and message from films like Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, Detroit Rock City or Rock and Roll High School, I cannot defend them as authentic good cinema.Fortunately, we also have gems like Almost Famous, 24 Hour Party People or A Hard Day's Night, which are brilliant cinematographic works which proudly take the flag of rock and wave it with a lot of enthusiasm and conviction.Even though I would consider The Boat That Rocked inferior to the films mentioned in the second group, I liked its energy, cast and enthusiasm very much.What makes this film not to be great are two elements: the narrative feels a bit diffuse on some moments and I think some moments are a bit forced.However, that did not avoid me to enjoy this film pretty much.The Boat That Rocked portrays an important moment in the 60's, when many bands and artists appeared in the UK as an answer to the North American rock 'n roll movement; all that originated the 'English invasion', one of the most important movements of popular music during the 20th century.However, in 1966, while the popularity of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Cream and other groups was spreading across the world, they were practically censored in the UK, because commercial radio stations practically ignored their existence.It was then when many intrepid businessmen decided to satisfy the music demand by the only possible way: pirate radio stations (which did not have an official permission) which transmitted all kind of rock from boats which were anchor in the international waters from the North Sea.That did not please to the British governors very much, but the listeners received the transmissions with enthusiasm.I think The Boat That Rocked portrays that period in History very well.Director and screenwriter Richard Curtis used in here a similar technique to the one he used on his great movie Love Actually: instead of telling a unified and cohesive story, he decided to show us a series of bullets with subjects in common, showing us many characters as the protagonists of brief stories which do not say very much individually, but which on the whole, they integrate a rich and very interesting tapestry of emotions, events and situations.Besides, the actors show enormous enthusiasm, energy and conviction on their characters.It would be impractical to mention every one of them, but I will mention that everyone are simply perfect on their roles.As I said on the first paragraph, I liked this movie pretty much, and I recommend it with confidence, but with the warning that it should not be expected a rigid and generic succession of events, but a collection of anecdotes whose function is not repeating 'the truth', but evoking the feelings, values and energy of a time.",8,2,4,30 November 2009
Creed," Creed
","Creed found a solid and interesting premise to resurrect the Rocky franchise, with a minimum ret-con and a modern sensibility which doesn't alter the spirit of its predecessors. Well, 'resurrect' might not be the correct word. Strictly speaking, Creed is more like a spin-off in which the legendary Rocky Balboa limits himself to train a boxer with talent with few experience. Basically, Sylvester Stallone inherits the role played by Burgess Meredith in the original Rocky back in 1976 (in fact, Stallone is the same age in Creed as Meredith was back then... and there's no need to say how much that little coincidence surprised me). However, Rocky makes an influence on every scene, enriching the tale without imposing himself and generally avoiding manifestations of excessive nostalgia. I say 'generally' because, among the cons of Creed, I have to mention some forced recreations of some iconic elements in the Rocky saga; for example, that famous race on the streets, and the use of the majestic music we all remember. I'm not saying they are badly used... I simply found them arbitrary nostalgic whims. But well, that complaint didn't affect the emotive and very satisfactory experience offered by Creed. Michael B. Jordan occupies the leading role with credibility and huge charisma (not to mention discipline... I can barely imagine the effort required to shoot a whole fight without any camera cuts), while Stallone carries his age with dignity and doesn't try to hide it; on the opposite, he takes advantage of his age in order to portray Rocky's evolution, always consistent with his nature and the facts established the last time we had seen him in the film Rocky Balboa, without forgetting the small humorous details which enhance his humanity. On the negative side, the romantic sub-plot feels unnecessary. Tessa Thompson brings a good performance and she's undoubtedly attractive, but the connection her character has with the main one feels obligatory and not very natural. And the adversary isn't very well developed either; actor Tony Bellew brings quite a personality to 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan, the arrogant boxing champion who needs an important fight as a public relations strategy after some legal slips; unfortunately, the movie dedicates him very little time, and the exciting final fight might have had some more impact if we had known the opponent better. On the other hand, I know that the point of Creed doesn't exclusively lie on reaching the 'big fight', but also creating a touching relationship between Adonis and Rocky, each one of them filling the holes in the life of the other one on some way. And on that aspect, I found Creed recommended, very entertaining and worthy as a continuation/tangent of a franchise with such many followers. I don't think it's as good as the original Rocky, but I consider it superior to any of the other sequels (specially Rocky III, IV and V). I would like to finish this review with a boxing analogy, but I'm afraid I don't know too much about that sport. Oh, there's one which just came to my mind: Creed is a knockout! Start the count to twelve, please.",8,3,6,6 February 2016
Spotlight," Spotlight
","I think we have all heard news about the 'slips' of many Catholic priests who abused of their position in order to obtain sexual favors from kids and teenagers. However, the film Spotlight has the purpose of portraying the tragic reality of those 'slips', as well as the huge dimension of the problem and the unforgivable complicity of the highest religious figures who tried to hide the truth, or at least minimize it until it seemed something infrequent and excusable. In order to achieve that, co-screenwriters Tom McCarthy (who was also the director) and Josh Singer wrote a solid screenplay, which, I must say, feels diffuse and fragmented on the beginning, with the reporters talking fast about people we don't know and events nobody has explained us. During 15 or 20 minutes, the experience was a bit frustrating, as if I had arrived late at the cinema. However, we end up building the puzzle at the same time as the characters; and when we discover the final 'image', we receive the same emotional impact as the characters. It was a risky strategy, but the result is very interesting, while trusting in the audience's capacity to think, instead of receiving everything spoon-fed. Besides, Spotlight feels like a love letter to investigative journalism, a discipline which has almost disappeared in this time of 'clickbait', instantaneous gratification and 'listicles' as a replacement of genuine information. Even with digital help (the events portrayed in this film happened in the early-2000s, so there already were electronic mail, mobile phones and all kinds of digital databases), the reporters have to invest long hours of real work, interviewing people, checking printed registers from the previous century and, specially, creating hypotheses they have to support with evidence. Hollywood has accustomed us to the typical scene in which someone uses a laptop to search in Google, and ready... in 30 seconds, he/she found the necessary information to capture a terrorist/discover the origin of a ghost/deduct the killer's identity, etc. But having to search everything in the real world changes the perspective of the narrative itself, and inspires renewed respect for this archaic discipline in danger of extinction. On the other hand, that means that Spotlight is a slow movie, with a deliberate rhythm which allows us to savor every detail of the story and the performances. Almost everything happens inside the austere offices of the newspaper; there are no chases, police mobilization, or legal trial with surprising verdicts; and even though the characters are well defined, there aren't any artificial conflicts to accentuate their emotions. Fortunately, those tricks aren't necessary when we have the excellent performances from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup and Brian d'Arcy James. In conclusion, I don't think I would consider Spotlight as a great movie; but it's a very interesting film which definitely deserves to be recommended.",8,2,3,11 February 2016
Concussion," Concussion
","Who would have imagined that receiving hits in the head for many years has negative consequences? I'm sorry. I don't want to seem insensitive. Dr. Bennet Omalu is obviously a medicine genius who didn't only overcome the racial and cultural prejudices of his new nation (the United States), but also had the courage to defy the huge economic interests who were against his discoveries. That's the central premise of Concussion, whose main pro is definitely the excellent performances from the whole cast, starting by Will Smith in the leading role, who brings intensity and credibility. The supporting cast also makes a perfect work, highlighting David Morse and Alec Baldwin. However... it was difficult for me to get interested in Omalu's investigation. Were there really any doubts about the effects of football on its players... specially in the brutal professional level? It's like making a film about the first doctor who related junk food with obesity: it's difficult to get surprised when we already knew it, even without scientific evidence. So, all the scenes in which different experts examine Omalu's data and they seriously nod with their heads lack of any dramatic impact, because it would be absurd to suppose that football is a safe and inoffensive sport to its players. And I wasn't convinced by the romantic sub-plot between Omalu and his 'roomie' either; it might have been like that in the real life, but it doesn't contribute to the main story too much, and it feels like typical 'filler' to humanize a character who didn't need it. Maybe, I should have started this review stating that I'm not a follower of football and I don't know very much about that sport (and the few things I know are probably wrong because I learned them from films such as Any Given Sunday and Draft Day). Therefore, I didn't have any illusions about the loyalty of NFL to its employees and I wasn't scandalized by its cold betrayal to the spirit of the sport; no wonder the corporations are the most popular villains of cinema. In conclusion, Concussion deserves a slight recommendation because of the performances and its valid warning against the dangers of a violent sport. Besides, who knows?, the film might save the lives young university (or high school) football players who recognize the danger before the damage is irreversible. But honestly, I didn't find it very satisfactory as a film, even though I will employ it as a new excuse not to do any exercise.",6,1,4,19 February 2016
Midnight in Paris," An excellent and highly enjoyable film
","Director and screenwriter Woody Allen's most recent filmography was quite irregular, because on the one hand, he made the very interesting movies Cassandra's Dream and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and on the other hand, he also made the tedious films Whatever Works and You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. So, I did not know what to exactly expect before watching Midnight in Paris. Would it be a forgettable scale in Allen's ride through Europe? Or would it be a delicious look to Paris through an inspired filmmaker's eyes? I am very glad to say that the answer is the second one, because Midnight in Paris is an intelligent, very satisfactory and hugely entertaining tribute to the cultural roots from 20th century.The story from Midnight in Paris is not particularly complicated or ambitious, but it did not need that in order to keep me very interested in its historical travel, whose purpose is not only making a tribute to Allen's cultural heroes, but also making valid reflections about universal subjects on which the contemporary civilization is based, as well as the belief that 'past times were better'. And the fact that those fascinating ideas exist into an entertaining and very funny screenplay shows Allen's big talent as a screenwriter. Sure, Midnight in Paris might not have the intellectual density from Crimes and Misdemeanors, or the emotional impact from Hanna and Her Sisters; but that does not avoid it from being an excellent movie on its own merits.Owen Wilson is absolutely perfect in the leading role. His reactions to the unusual events he lives (and the titanic figures he meets) have the exact tone to share the surprise with the spectator, and at the same time, he accepts everything with the necessary aplomb and credibility to avoid more questions than the necessary. In fact, big part of the comedy resides on those reactions; as an example, I can mention the commentary he makes the first time he finds an old car which takes him to the '20s. 'Is that a Peugeot? A friend of mine collects them in Beverly Hills'. Well, written is not funny; it would be better for you to watch the movie in order to appreciate how Wilson's performance increments the humor, drama and sensation of amazement from the screenplay. Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen and Kurt Fuller are equally good on their respective performances as capricious girlfriend, pretentious erudite and father-in-law; however, their characters tend to be antagonistic figures, so they are not as likable as the main character.I think it was a great idea to use unknown actors to interpret various of the historical figures which inhabit the 20th century, because that does not contaminate our expectations of 'meeting' them. The actors who stand out in those roles are Corey Stoll, Tom Hiddleston and Adrien de Van. The only famous actors who interpret historical figures are Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody, and they also bring solid performances.The best thing if all in Midnight in Paris is that, despite its deep cultural vein, it never feels pretentious nor inaccessible. Those who know the works of the characters portrayed in here (even though if it is VERY superficially, like in my case) might enjoy it a bit more for understanding the references and premonitions about future events (for example, the relationship between F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda). But I think that even those without any interest in that historical period will not have any problem enjoying this film. In conclusion, despite a few minor fails from the screenplay, I liked Midnight in Paris very much, and I recommend it very enthusiastically, not only because it has definitely become into one of my favorite films from Allen's filmography, but also because on its own, it is a very entertaining, perfectly directed and brilliantly written movie.",9,1,4,7 August 2011

Pan's Labyrinth," Very fine film
","I always liked Guillermo del Toro's films;but on his most serious films(Chronos or The devil's backbone)I noticed that they need something else to be more than good movies of fantastic genre.Pan's labyrinth is another of his serious movies and something similar happened to me with this one:it is a good movie which lacks of that something that would make it excellent;here ''something'' is originality like his other serious movies.The best thing about Pan's labyrinth is that it shakes three parallel stories that they unite doing something credible.At one sight,the movie shows the familiar drama of the main girl,her mother and the mother's boyfriend;for other sight,the movie shows the horrors of the civil war and for other sight,the movie shows Pan's fantastic world.The performances are excellent,but the best ones are Sergi Lopez's,Maribel Verdú's and Ivana Baquero's.I liked this movie pretty much and I consider it very good;if it had been more original,it would have been better.Of the serious movies Del Toro made,this is my favorite movie.",8,4,9,15 December 2006
Begin Again," Begin Again is a pleasant, but not very memorable, film
","The main risk in a film about the process of musical creation is the fact that the music isn't as good as the screenplay supposes so. Unfortunately, that's the case with Begin Again. The songs from Gretta and Dan, the main characters, are pleasant and honest, but they never reach the necessary degree of greatness in order to convince us on her talent as a composer, or his magic vision as a producer. But nevertheless, Begin Again works reasonably well because of its narrative; and even though the music isn't particularly brilliant, it works as an attractive accompaniment (and occasionally catalyst) of the human drama. And then, we have the solid performances from the whole cast, starting by Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, who are completely credible as two 'lost souls' seeking for a new sense in their lives, which they might find sharing a creative project. Catherine Keener and Hailee Steinfeld also bring honest and detailed works as Dan's wife and daughter (respectively). Adam Levine (the singer from Maroon 5) plays the character of Gretta's unfaithful husband, but he took the good decision of not portraying him as a monster, but as a typical rock star who was a victim of his own success. I don't like Levine's music band, but he has shown talent as an actor in this movie. In conclusion, I found Begin Again entertaining and pleasant, but forgettable and superficial. I can give it a moderate recommendation as an inoffensive weekend distraction, but if you want to see brilliant films about musical creation, I recommend you Once (whose director, John Carney, was the same one from Begin Again) or Phantom of the Paradise.",7,1,2,11 October 2014
Shutter Island," An interesting movie, but I expected more from Scorsese
","Do not misunderstand me...I liked Shutter Island, because it certainly offers various positive elements.However, on a deeper level, it does not look like a film from director Martin Scorsese...I generally could not feel on it that fierce energy which identified many of his movies.Nevertheless, I will not deny this is an entertaining film which produces a good atmosphere.I had special interest in this movie, because it represented the first incursion from Scorsese in the mystery genre; I suppose his remake of Cape Fear could get into that category, but Shutter Island has many traditional elements from the genre, from mysterious disappearances to dark dungeons where the danger lurks everywhere.On that aspect, the first half of the movie works pretty well at establishing the mystery, suggesting a treacherous motivation for the villain and showing the tortuous past from the hero, which adds a personal subtext to the investigation he makes.However, on the second half, the movie looses the focus with false clues, redundant scenes and narrative alleys.Besides, I do not know whether Scorsese did not feel very comfortable working with this material, or if he wanted to make a tribute to films like The Silence of the Lambs, The Shining and Spellbound (1945).However, I would have preferred a more personal vision of the genre, and not a mere reproduction of the innovations introduced by other movies.The aficionados to film or literary thriller will know that the stories which involve asylums, psychiatrists and mental perturbations always end up falling on three or four narrative formulas.Shutter Island is not the exception, and it was pretty easy for me to predict the twist in the end which should have supposedly left us amazed.Dennis Lehane (the author of the book this movie is based on -which, by the way, I have not read-) may noticed that, so he decided to distract us and confuse the road from the story.However, the only thing he made is adding an extra half an hour which makes the story a bit tiring.However, on the positive side from this movie, we have Scorsese's efficient direction and the solid performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and Michelle Williams.Talking about Williams, she appears on the best moments of the movie, and it was there where I seemed to recognize Scorsese as I usually know him; unfortunately, the rest of the movie lacks of identity, and it limits to be a competent thriller, but which is not very ambitious or highly memorable.However, I recommend it to have a time of interesting mystery.In summary, this is a good movie, but I expected more from it.",7,0,2,13 March 2010
We Are Marshall," A mediocre movie which is not too satisfactory,but is moderatately entertaining

Interstellar," Interstellar is an excellent sci-fi film
","Director Christopher Nolan woke up one day, and he thought: '21st century needs its own version of 2001: A Space Odyssey'. And so, he decided to make Interstellar. Well, I might be exaggerating. After all, 2001: A Space Odyssey was an economical failure in the time of its release, and it was as the years went by that its huge ambition and influence on the science fiction genre was recognized. So, time will tell whether Intersteller deserves to occupy that same cultural niche. But in my personal case, I think Interstellar is a brilliant science fiction film which will stay in my memory for a long time. To start with, the ideas exposed by Interstellar are fascinating, audacious, and they belong to the level of 'serious' science fiction we rarely find in mainstream cinema. And besides, the ideas are raised with a certain subtleness which makes them more universal. For example, the catastrophe which threatens humanity is ambiguous on its shape, but clear on its effects; on that way, the screenplay filters an ecological message which doesn't feel as such, but as an integral part of a vast story, letting the audience assimilate it in order to enrich the experience. In the same way, many of the subjects from Interstellar reside on the periphery of the drama, making us seek them instead of having them spoon-fed. The actors make an excellent work in their roles, highlighting Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy. My only disappointment regarding the cast was the reduced screen-time from Michael Caine and John Lithgow (two of my favorite actors). Both make a perfect work in their roles, and I truly wanted to see them in an 'acting duel'... but they only have one brief scene together, and they barely exchange a few words. I also have to mention the beautiful images and space views created by the studio Double Negative. The special effects share the previously mentioned subtleness, discarding the 'space porn' from Star Trek or Guardians of the Galaxy in order to implement a more realistic vision, centered on the vision of the astronauts, where we see only what is necessary in order to understand what is happening without distracting us from the human drama which always leads the film. On the negative side of Interstellar, I will only mention three things: to start with, we have the occasionally forced sentimentality from the film, which feels a bit out of place inside the fascinating story; I also felt the late introduction of an unnecessary villain a bit out of place; and finally, I disliked the lacking of 'science' in this excellent science fiction film. On the one hand, I understand the fact that Interstellar decided not to spend time with every single 'realistic' detail of space travel, but on the other hand, some big licenses are too notorious (for example, the gravitational equation and its relationship with a space phenomenon). Nevertheless, those complaints didn't avoid Interstellar from being a memorable, fascinating and hugely satisfactory experience. So, I don't know whether Interstellar is truly a landmark which will re-define cinematographic science fiction for the following decades, but it's definitely one of the best films I have seen this year, and another example of Nolan's maturity and talent as a filmmaker. I like the science fiction with the emphasis on science, but sometimes, the emotions are more appropriate to tell stories about humanity and hope.",9,3,7,8 November 2014
Lion," Lion
","Lion is the best Google commercial I have seen. Leaving that aside, director Garth Davis drives the first hour of the film in quite an efficient way, making us share the fear and confusion of the kid Saroo, far from his home and overwhelmed by the chaotic environment of the big city, in which every kind of dangers are lurking at every corner... even from individuals trying to help him. That was the part of Lion I liked the most, because it evokes powerful emotions without the typical 'creative manipulation' employed by many films to accentuate the drama. Lion doesn't need those tricks... for its first hour only. Then, we jump 20 years to the future, and the film loses the honesty which had previously captured me. That doesn't mean that the second half is bad; but I personally found it manipulative and occasionally forced and cloying. Nevertheless, the performances from Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara and David Wenham (who all show up during that part) are very good. However, that second half can never recover the energy and raw realism of the first hour, both obtained due to Davis' direction and the brilliant performance from Sunny Pawar, and that avoided the experience from being totally satisfactory in my case, even though I can give it a moderate recommendation.",7,4,6,19 February 2017
The Bourne Ultimatum," An excellent action film
","I expected a lot for The Bourne Ultimatum.I liked a lot the first two parts because they were extremely fun and intense.Luckily,The Bourne Ultimatum surpassed my expectations.This is an excellent action film totally fun and intense.Director Paul Greengrass(who brought us the magnificent film United 93)made a wonderful work.His semi-documentary style makes the movie very dynamic.The camera behind the movie is anxious and that brings the movie a very realistic style.And,the best thing of all,is that the action is totally understandable with a shaky camera.Jason Bourne is not the typical superman because we can see some vulnerability on him and I thank that a lot on an action movie.The actors are perfect on their roles.Matt Damon brings a detailed performance which makes us know characteristics about his character.Paddy Considine,Scott Glenn and the brilliant Albert Finney have brief performances but they give some memorable elements to their characters.The movie raises us something interesting:there are villains on this movie but,are they villains for doing bad things for their country? or are they tormented heroes because of the hard decisions they have to take?.I found that thing great and one of the best elements from this movie.Some things on the script may are not well polished and that minimum fail does not dark all the amusement this film brings.The Bourne Ultimatum is a great action film which is extremely fun,intense and exciting.If you wanna have a great moment,do not doubt in seeing The Bourne Ultimatum.",9,1,3,4 September 2007
Fargo," Very original and great movie
","Fargo is one of the greatest movies from 90's.I have to congrats the Coen bros.for writing a such an original and entertaining script like the one from this film.If you wanna see the movie,pay a lot of attention.This is the kind of movie you should not distract,because you would loose some important details.Frances Mc Dormand,Steve Buscemi and William H.Macy are simply great on this movie.I loved the way in which the Coen bros.made this thriller and the twists it has.Fargo is a classic movie that tells a fun,original story with great performances.I totally recommend this great movie.Thank you,Coen bros.for giving us this little masterpiece.Rating:10",10,2,3,23 July 2006
The Revenant," The Revenant
","The Revenant is a very competent fusion of cinematographic technique and artistic vision, whose stylistic attributes transcend a simultaneously dense and empty screenplay. For some reason, the general effect it leaves is lesser to the experience offered by the individual scenes. Its narrative basis exclusively lies on the traditional ideals of the western genre (self-sufficiency, honor, revenge and the unavoidable challenge of natural forces, while they are paid the respect they deserve). And sure, all that is spiced by wide doses of pseudo-philosophy in order to prove that the main character's physical torture has a cosmic meaning we can barely understand ('God is a squirrel'). In summary: much ado about nothing. Having said that... what a good ado. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu and the brilliant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki repeated the amazing visual ballet of Birdman, with the graceful camera floating without any difficulty over complicated sequences in order to display the most dramatic details of the action and the performances in a simultaneously casual and precise way, sometimes with open shots which illustrate the geography of the locations, and sometimes, with those eloquent extreme close-ups which never feel confined. Unfortunately, what The Revenant couldn't preserve from Birdman are the deliciously intricate screenplay and its rich tapestry of character and emotion, which, after all, ended up being more important than any tracking shot or invisible integration of special effects. On the opposite, The Revenant is a simplistic linear tale with unidimensional characters who suffer a lot... but express little beyond of what is evident. Hugh Glass is the hero with a strong volition and a very clear motivation; Fitzgerald is the devious, treacherous and intolerant villain. And that's it. Two hours and a half of a slow chase, extraordinarily shot but without a bigger dramatic ambition. Sure, besides of the hero and the villain, we also have another faction of persecutors to complicate things a bit and bring us a lesson about the evilness of 'white man'; but leaving that aside, they don't have much relevance, at least until the screenplay needs them as a predictable deus-ex-machina. On the positive side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy received deserved recognition for their excellent performances, and I would also like to mention Domhnall Gleeson's unfairly ignored work, in which he credibly displays a good range of emotions. This is undoubtedly a 'style over substance' case, but in spite of that, The Revenant was a very interesting experience, and it definitely deserves to be watched on a big screen in order to appreciate its technical triumphs better.",8,1,2,28 January 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Tedious and very unsatisfactory
","I am not a big fan of the Harry Potter books, but I did not hate them either.I appreciate their vivid main characters and the fluid 'voice' from author J.K. Rowling, but I think that the saga suffered from a severe case of 'giantism', unnecessarily extending itself with 'surprising' revelations of a doubtful importance; carloads of new characters who are either simple fillers or convenient victims of inept villains; and an out of control 'ret-con' to justify the twisted narrative roads which lead to nowhere.I honestly think that the story about the young magician could have been told in only three books, but I think that it was Rowling's creative (or economic) ambition what unnecessarily inflated the series.As for the film adaptations of the books, I did not like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban; I found Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to be mediocre; and I liked Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, because they condensed the bloated books into competent screenplays, by extirpating the 'straw' and concentrating on the narrative knot.Unfortunately, that did not happen with the film adaptation of the last book, which was divided in two films as a desperate financial maneuver to extend one of the most successful franchises in film History a little bit more.And having seen the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, I felt it exactly like that: a marketing trick, and not as a genuine culmination of the saga.When Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 ended, I asked to myself: Two and a half hours for this? I think that the important elements from this film could have easily occupied the first half hour from the following film without losing the spirit from the book or the growth from the main characters.Big part of this film is a boring 'road movie' in which the three main characters run through woods, grassland and mountains...with which purpose? Was that really their plan to destruct Voldemort? For being such a redundant and unnecessary movie, they could have invested some minutes in 'Previously on Harry Potter', or something like that, in order to have a clearer perspective of the situation and the past events.Of course that that will be unnecessary for the 'hardcore' fans who know the seven books by heart and spend hours discussing about the sexual tension between Ron Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange (or similar subjects).And I am sure that those fans will find Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 much more satisfactory than me.But as a casual spectator, I found it to be extremely tedious and repetitive.Besides, the melodrama in this movie feels artificial, while the 'comic relief' is not funny at all and the action sequences lack of any emotion or suspense (even though the special effects are very well done).And the least I say about the central mystery between the 'horcruxes' and the relics, the better...it does not make too much sense and it sins from the typical 'deus-ex-machina' from Rowling.On the positive side, I have to mention that Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint bring solid performances.I think that the biggest problem from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1 is that I could never feel a real narrative impulse, or the organic development from a story; I simply found a list of situations and places the film has to visit, but without a genuine cohesion between them.So, in conclusion, I personally found this film to be very boring and unsatisfactory...and if that were not enough, I was left with the impression that this film is nothing more than a financial trick from the executives from Warner Bros. to squeeze more money from the fans of Harry Potter who have been faithful to the saga for almost 10 years.",5,6,12,20 November 2010
Warrior," Warrior is an unexpectedly excellent film
","Before watching Warrior, I expected it to be a poor imitation of Rocky, but set in the more violent world of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts). However, the reality ended up being very different, because Warrior is an excellent film which is more similar to The Fighter, in which we had also seen the rivalry between two brothers dedicated to the same brutal sport, balancing the action with a deep family drama in which the repair of grudges ends up being as important as the fight on the ring (or octagon, or whatever it is).It's not very common to find a martial arts movie such well written, directed and acted as Warrior is. For better or for worse, this kind of stories is usually relegated to 'B' cinema, in which the action takes precedence over elements such as performances and narrative. On the opposite, Warrior counts with a very well written screenplay, perfect direction and wonderful performances from Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy, who both work perfectly as brothers/rivals with turbulent emotions under their laconic surface.The only complaint I have against Warrior is that its screenplay includes a few clichés. Nevertheless, I unexpectedly enjoyed this movie very much, and I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm. In summary, a very pleasant surprise.",9,0,3,29 February 2012
The White Ribbon," A very interesting, but not perfect, film experience
","It might seem strange the fact that director Michael Haneke, who is mostly famous for making thrillers, made a historical drama which emulates the visual chiaroscuro and the narrative melancholy from various films directed by Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007). However, the screenplay from The White Ribbon hides enough terrifying surprises to make it pretty tense, but the horror itself is left to the audience's imagination, limiting itself to show us the most mundane aspects which surround the moral and spiritual collapse from a small German town in the previous days to the start of World War I.The elegant manufacture from The White Ribbon reminded me of the European art-house cinema from mid-20th century, cold on its surface, but with boiling emotions which are hidden by the habitual protocol from 'the old continent'.The element I most appreciated in The White Ribbon is that the screenplay can be interpreted in various different ways. The historical period from the story (just before World War I) and the commentaries from the narrator (who seriously mentions 'the bleak future from my country') can indicate that the movie tries to capture the social discontent which encouraged the nationalist movement...and the eventual rise of the Nazism. Something which can also be interpreted is that the point from the film is to show the inherent 'evilness' which is developed from the intolerance. And it is also possible to conceive that what the film tries to say is that the evilness does not exist...the only thing we have is different points of view, where the atrocity committed by one person is the heroic act from another one. There are other levels of interpretation in The White Ribbon, but my point is that it was very interesting to see a film which can be interpreted on different ways, inspiring the spectator to think and draw conclusions.On the negative side from The White Ribbon, I have to mention that some moments feel a bit pretentious, and that there are some scenes which could have been deleted, since they feel a bit unnecessary in the context from the movie. Nevertheless, the solid screenplay and some excellent moments of anguish and tension are enough reason to recommend The White Ribbon as a very interesting movie.",8,1,3,26 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The worst movie on Harry Potter series
","Harry Potter 1 is a boring film.The second one is better but not great thing.But the third one is terrible,extremely boring and so slow.I put this movie 4 only for Rupert Grint who gives an excellent performance.Before the movie was released, I read the book and I saw the trailer and I thought that it was going to be the best of the three.But I was totally wrong.This is a boring film.Alfonso CuarÃ³n made an excellent film called And your mother too.But this is his following movie and it is boring.I hope that he will back to the independent cinema.This is a movie totally boring and I do not recommend this movie.",4,0,0,13 March 2006
Ratatouille," This is Pixar's return to greatness.Excellent film
","I suppose Pixar had some pressure during the making of Ratatouille for two reasons:to recover some credibility the studio lost with Cars and because of all the animated films which attract little kids with the realistic animation,but without the creativity and imagination Pixar has showed from its first efforts.Luckily,the director of Ratatouille is the great Brad Bird,whose work in the TV series The Simpsons,The Critic and King of the Hill and in the movies The Iron Giant and The Incredibles is simply brilliant.Ratatouille is at the same level of that great works and it's very fun,funny and creative.One of the things I appreciate on Pixar movies is that they use voices they complement the characters without caring about the popularity of the actors.Patton Oswalt is perfect on the voice of Remy;Ian Holm is heard sinister on his villain character.The animation of Ratatouille is amazing but,on our days,we are accustomed to see wonderful animation,as we could see on Shrek the Third or Over the Hedge.But,the story this movie tells is so good that I could forget I was watching an animated movie,and that's something great for a kids film.The main character is a rat and this movie shows the nice and relative sight of that hated animal.Maybe,Bird put that as a challenge to the spectator to show that when the film is so fun and the story so good,the spectators forget their prejudices.Another great element this movie has is that some themes and narrative tones are much more mature than on another kids films.The only fail I found on this movie is that,near the ending,there's a typical cliché.But I can excuse that.Ratatouille is a great movie which is funny,emotive and never boring.After Cars,which was a little disappointing because it was not as good as the other films made by Pixar,Ratatouille represents the great return of an excellent animation studio.",9,3,5,7 July 2007
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Men: Days of Future Past is quite a solid superheroes film
","Like many films about time travel, X-Men: Days of Future Past occasionally stumbles over its own rules. Besides, there are some inconsistencies in the continuity of the saga, not to mention that the screenplay has few things in common with the comic Days of Future Past. All those factors make the narrative to feel a bit disperse, because there are so many characters and events that the scenes don't always flow naturally, and it can be noticed that screenwriter Simon Kinberg had to give them some push. But fortunately, X-Men: Days of Future Past has much more pros than cons. The characters continue with their evolution and learning, invariably considering their nature over their mutant powers, and as consequence, the film isn't only enjoyed because of the epic battles between human and mutants, but also because of the emotional conflicts from the characters. In other words, X-Men: Days of Future Past doesn't only care for the special effects, but also for the dialogues and the human conflicts. However, that doesn't mean that the battles and the special effects are bad; on the opposite, there are some excellent displays of mutant power (Quicksilver's appearance and Mystique in Paris come to mind). As for the actors, they all made a perfect work, highlighting James McAvoy, Hugh Jackman and the great Peter Dinklage. In conclusion, I would consider X-Men: Days of Future Past inferior to X-Men, X2 and X-Men: First Class, but superior to X-Men: The Last Stand, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Wolverine. But whatever the way it is, I found it very entertaining, and I consider it worthy of a recommendation.",8,1,3,26 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America: Civil War
","What the hell is next after Captain America: Civil War? Well, I guess I know what's next... the Phase 3 of Marvel Cinematic Universe, which will go through deep changes in the characters and the continuity which started 8 years ago, when Iron Man was released. What I didn't expect was the ending of Phase 2 to be so... I don't think I can finish that phrase not revealing more than I should, so I will limit myself to mention the reasons why I enjoyed Captain America: Civil War so much. The fans of the epic comic saga Civil War will recognize the same story in broad strokes, even though its dimension was considerably reduced. However, I don't mention that as something negative, because it was obvious that a 146-minute film wasn't going to be able to contain the hundreds of characters and sub-plots which integrated that 'crossover' (not to mention the copyright nightmare implied by the legal rights of such many characters scattered between multiple studios). I will even say that the abbreviation of the conflict to a dozen of characters distillates the main ideas of the tale, making them more potent and forging not only an exciting and hugely entertaining film, but an appropriate punchline to the events which have been gestating since 2008; in other words: this was the ideal moment to make Captain America: Civil War... when we already know the characters very well, and we share their uncertainty on the mission of 'avenging' the whole world. Besides, on a more visceral aspect, we already know what each hero is capable of doing, so when the unavoidable fights come, it's a pleasure too see them measuring their abilities, exchanging demolishing punches and fulfilling the fantasies of uncountable 'fanboys' (like me), who many times wondered 'who would win' in hypothetical fights with infinite permutations of opponents. But the most remarkable thing is that, even with such familiar characters, co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely found the way of surprising us with twists and unexpected tangents, while perfectly integrating the new heroes and villains to the narrative flow. The only thing I can say against Captain America: Civil War is that the tendency to the 'shaky cam' obstructs the excellent choreography a bit during some of the action scenes. But despite that small complaint, I liked Captain America: Civil War very much, and I found it one of the best films from Marvel Studios (I would personally place it in the TOP 3, along with Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy). I enthusiastically recommend it to the fans of Marvel's and those who like action cinema with a good dramatic endorsement, because Captain America: Civil War places as much importance on the characters and the story as on the action, instead of exclusively focusing on the special effects... which had exactly been one of the main problems of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.",9,12,23,5 May 2016
Inside Out," Inside Out
","Inside Out gradually introduces us into the complexities of human mind in an accessible way, so therefore, this ambitious ride through the turbulent emotions of pre-adolescence is likable and very entertaining, without losing a considerable emotional resonance I hadn't seen in a Pixar film since Toy Story 2. And I'm not talking about an easy emotional manipulation, but an authentic comprehension of the mood swings we all experience in moments of crisis and transition. What the hell does all that mean? It doesn't matter; it's better to watch the film. Not all the concepts harmonically integrate themselves into the vertiginous narrative; there are some arbitrary moments which exploit the diffuse logic of the story, and the ending feels like a convenient 'deus ex machina'. However, Inside Out has many pros to offer, such as the excellent voice work from the whole cast, specially Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader, Louis Black and Phyllis Smith. And we also have the many voices which bring weight, humor or sensibility to the supporting or incidental roles, making them equally relevant and funny (Diane Lane, Kyle MacLachlan, Richard Kind, Paula Poundstone, Bobby Moynihan, Paula Pell, Flea, Rashida Jones, John Ratzenberger and the great Frank Oz). Besides, we have the extraordinary images created by the Pixar artists, with characters full of expressiveness, settings of a magical design, casual realism and the accustomed details which make us smile or think when we least expected it (by the way, don't forget to stay during the end credits to understand the difference between cats and dogs). In conclusion, I wouldn't consider it an excellent movie, but I think Inside Out marks Pixar's return to original thought, the solid combination of animation, story and imagination, and the dramatic zeal which characterized its best films, before they became a factory of sequels and toy commercials to satisfy the ambition of its corporative father. Sure, there seem to be many second, third and even fourth parts in the list of Pixar's future projects, but as long as they keep that seed of creativity which generates innovative movies such as Inside Out, things will be on the right track. I think this film doesn't only represent the girl Riley's 'coming of age', but also Pixar's itself; after a difficult period of adjustment, life is extended to a future full of possibilities. I wonder what is waiting for them in the adolescence...",8,8,31,22 June 2015
No Country for Old Men," Great movie,crappy ending
","After the false move of The Ladykillers,directors Joel and Ethan Coen redeem themselves with No Country for Old Men,which is a great movie but with a crappy ending.First of all,let's see all the good points this film has.The movie has a slow,but never boring tone and that helps for making us perfectly know the characters.The performances are extraordinary.Javier Bardem brings a magnificent performance and all the awards he received are totally deserved.Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones also bring great performances.And,the film has some excellent moments of tension.But,as I said before,this movie was great until that crappy ending.The conclusion is very forced and artificial and that ending took out points to this movie.No Country for Old Men is a great movie but the ending is very frustrating.I was going to give this movie a 9 out of 10 but,with that conclusion,the rating went down to an 8.Still with that,I totally recommend this film.",8,2,5,6 March 2008
District 9," An excellent film of genuine Science Fiction
","I am accustomed to watch 'science fiction' movies to discover they are really adventure stories set on a futuristic, extraterrestrial or high-tech context.The emphasis is always on the explosions and special effects, ignoring the authentic basis from the genre: provocative ideas, reflections on human condition and speculation about the future of the human beings.So, genuine Science Fiction (yes, with capital letters) movies (like the extraordinary Gattaca and Children of Men) do not appear very frequently.I am happy to say District 9 is one of those fascinating movies, and it offers a high level of satisfaction for two facets of spectators: the ones who look for action and special effects and the ones who want something more thought-provoking and which feeds the brain.The main character from this movie is brilliant because he shows a very interesting ambiguous morality and an amazing emotional evolution during the movie.The story is also excellent for many elements.On the one hand, it shows us that the 'villians' are not only those who have hate on their hearts and weapons on their hands, but also those who rationalize their behaviour in order to disguise (at least on their minds) even the worst elements from human condition.Another very interesting aspect from the screenplay is the culture crash it shows, because it points out the human prejudice against anything which is not traditional.All those allegories would have become dull if they were not endorsed by a simultaneously subtle and brilliant satire which makes us occasionally smile, and which proves director and screenwriter Neill Blomkamp takes his movie seriously, but not enough to deny the intrinsic humor from some scenes.In summary, a great combination of ideas, drama, humor and suspense.But District 9 is not only political judgement and abstract concepts.The deep narrative is accompanied by extraordinary special effects and a perfect direction.The action sequences are brilliant, not only because of their manufacture, but also because they endorse the screenplay and they obey to the narrative flow from it.But let's go back to the special effects.The studio Weta deserves all kind of recognition for their monumental work, not only because of the extraterrestrial elements, but also because of the creation of authentic performances in the aliens.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few elements from the screenplay feel a bit forced.But that is a minor fail, and it did not avoid me from liking this movie very much.District 9 is a fascinating movie, which does not only analyze about potent and controversial subjects, but which also made me have an exciting, full of suspense and hugely entertaining time.Pity this excellent movie went completely unnoticed in the North American box office, while the tedious Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will end up as the most economically successful film from 2009.I recommend District 9 with a lot of enthusiasm.",9,1,7,16 October 2009

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Imperfect but very entertaining
","I found The Lord of the Rings cinematographic trilogy an extraordinary adaptation of essential novels from fantastic genre. After that, director Peter Jackson made the excellent remake of King Kong and the tedious The Lovely Bones, which was completely lacking of any emotion and narrative force. Fortunately, Jackson redeems himself with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, a very entertaining epic film...even though not lacking of some insipid passages and more characters than the necessary.The screenplay of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is chronologically set 60 years before The Lord of the Rings, and as a consequence, it doesn't follow the same characters from that trilogy. Some of them have brief cameos, but we won't find the same dynamic between races nor the balance of heroic archetypes. And the 13 'leading' dwarfs are peripheral figures, reduced to their most basic identity trait: the fat one, the funny one, etc. The only exception is Thorin...pity that his personality doesn't go beyond his superficial function. For better or for worse, the 'Company of Dwarfs' are extras in their own story (so far). On the other hand, this lets Ian McKellen and the great Martin Freeman carry with the dramatic weight of the film, and they are both completely credible in their roles while having a perfect chemistry with each other.Then, we have Jackson's solid direction, which competently balances the personal drama with the visual spectacle. The special effects widely surpass the ones of The Lord of the Rings trilogy (naturally, the studio Weta had almost 10 years in order to improve their technology), but I occasionally kinda missed the employment of more practical effects, specially regarding creatures and enemies. On some moments, I felt the action scenes exceeded the requirements of the story and crossed to the 'see what we can do now' field. On the positive side, Jackson shows a precise control over the tone and atmosphere, orchestrating light 'comic relief' scenes without decreasing gravity to the serious moments of introspection and personal growth.I'm now going to invest some time in writing about the controversial system of 48 frames per second employed in the shooting and exhibition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Against my custom, I decided to watch this film on 'HFR 3D', and I have to admit that the quality of image was phenomenal, much better than any other thing I have ever watched on a big screen. On the other hand, I keep disliking the 3D, because I think it darkens the image and overshadows the colours. However, regarding the HD system at 48 frames per second...I'm totally convinced. In conclusion, I didn't like The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey as much as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I think it made a very good work at introducing us to another facet of Middle Earth. So, I can definitely recommend it as a very solid and entertaining film. Having said that, when will Jackson make the 'independent horror film' he has been promising for years? I like the fantasy, but I want to see him back to the territory of Bad Taste and Dead Alive as soon as possible.",8,4,15,15 December 2012

The Pianist," Spectacular film
","A lot of film critics say Roman Polanski makes cold movies.These critics say his movies have cold emotions.But,personally,the emotive and cold touch Polanski gives to his films is totally appropriate.For example,The tenant(one of my favorite films directed by Polanski)would have been absurd without that cold touch.And,if the spectacular film The pianist would not have that cold touch,it would have been extremely dramatic.The pianist is an excellent and spectacular film.The best thing about this movie is that the main character is not taken as a hero.The experiences he has are a torture.The theme of the Holocaust and the Nazis has been told on a lot of movies and it's not easy to present a new face of this villains.Polanski shows that theme on a very realistic way.The movie brings a lot of questions but it does not bring easy answers to them.It only shows everything with a lot of realism and the spectator has to take out conclusions.For Polanski,this story is totally personal because he lived the war's horrors when he was a kid.This thing makes The pianist very real because the story is told through the eyes of someone who lived that horrors.The pianist is an extraordinary film,real art.",10,0,2,1 March 2007
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel is quite an entertaining film
","The films from director Wes Anderson are unmistakable, because of their flamboyant visual style and the narrative which takes the characters through absurd routes of comedy and drama which rarely lead to where the audience expected. Needless to say that this style isn't everyone's cup of tea; personally, I liked some of his films very much (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom), but I wasn't left completely satisfied by other ones (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Darjeeling Limited). Fortunately, The Grand Budapest Hotel, his most recent film, shows us Anderson in quite a good shape, investing a huge care for the story to be always interesting, to make the characters feel real despite their eccentricities, and to make every frame of the movie a delight to the view. In that way, despite some scenes which cross the line from the idiosyncrasy to the irritation and a few forced details, we can always have a solid production design, extraordinary cinematography and the vision of a filmmaker who has the ability to combine images and emotions into a funny, melancholic and deep film. But, as I said before, not everyone will appreciate this vision, and some people might find the universe in which Anderson frames this tragicomic farce pretentious. Or they might find the 'retro' special effects and the use of models in many exterior scenes (like the observatory in the Alps) ridiculous. I personally found that appropriate, because even the real sized sets look like models in The Grand Budapest Hotel. And that might be the reason why it transmits us the sensation that the characters are toys controlled by a kid with too much imagination in order to let logic and 'reality' interfere with his vivacious fantasies. Sure, not too many kids could accompany their games with a perfect score from Alexandre Desplat or with an army of famous actors ready to fill in even the smallest roles just for the sake of being a part of Anderson's game (Was it just me, or did I really see George Clooney for a fraction of second?). In conclusion, I wouldn't consider it an excellent film, but I enjoyed The Grand Budapest Hotel pretty much, and I recommend it to those who want to visit an extravagant universe which is always conscious of its duties as a film.",8,1,5,26 April 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A very entertaining horror comedy
","I have already complained in other occasions about the various bad horror films which are exhibited in cinemas, while many very good or excellent films of the genre languish in the darkness of the straight-to-DVD market, due to a poor distribution system which is incapable of recognizing genuine quality when it is in front of it. Unfortunately, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is another recent victim of that phenomenon...shelved for a long time and without a defined distribution contract, but with a big number of followers thanks to its presence in multiple film festivals. Anyway...I am not going to spend more time explaining that sad situation. I will better focus on the movie itself, which despite not being something great by my point of view, is a very satisfactory and entertaining horror comedy.To start with, the screenplay from Tucker and Dale vs. Evil includes very interesting twists, as well as ingenious changes of points of view employed by co-screenwriters Eli Craig (who was also the director) and Morgan Jurgenson in order to create two parallel and to some point contradictory stories, but which also both feel consistent and complementary. So, I have to say I found the screenplay simultaneously hilarious, interesting and emotive, specially when it plays with our perception of the 'rural horror' in order to explore new narrative possibilities which are not common to find in a horror comedy.Another important pro from Tucker and Dale vs. Evil comes from its two main actors. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk make a perfect couple as Tucker and Dale, and their performances are so good that the friendship between their characters feels absolutely honest from the beginning to the end. Besides, the spontaneous attitude they both bring to their works makes their characters to feel human, even when their actions border on the caricature. Katrina Bowden is a genuine revelation in this movie. Having seen her for various years as the vacuous and naive Cerie in 30 Rock, I expected her performance in Tucker and Dale vs. Evil to be the one of a typical 'final girl' with a pretty face but few histrionic talent; however, she ended up destroying that expectation with an absolutely credible and likable performance in here.The complains I have against Tucker and Dale vs. Evil are that the romantic component feels occasionally a bit weakly written, and that a few scenes break the flow from the film (such as the one of an improvised session of group therapy). For the rest, I enjoyed Tucker and Dale vs. Evil pretty much, and I consider it worthy of a safe recommendation. Pity that this film was condemned to the darkness by the distributors, because it really does not deserve it.",8,2,2,26 December 2011
City of God," One of the greatest movies of last years.Terrific
","City of God is a film that stayed with me a lot of time of going out the theater where I saw it.This movie is simply awesome and terrific and it tells a story that,sadly,is based on true events.I'm sure that the film isn't for everyone.A sensitive person shouldn't see it.There are very disturbing violent scenes(some involving children).Fernando Meirelles shows,with this movie and his another movie The constant gardener,that he's an excellent director.City of God is a superb movie,a bit hard to watch,but really great.Movies like this one aren't seen everyday.Rating:10",10,0,2,8 August 2006
JFK," This is a perfect movie
","The movie is perfect,and it is one of my favorite movie.The movie is long but it never bores.One of the things I love from this movie is that it is a movie to think and at the same time,a hugely entertaining movie.By my point of view,this movie should have won best picture at the Oscars because it is highly superior to The silence of the lambs.The screenplay is very well written,while Oliver Stone's direction is perfect.As for the cast, everyone brings solid and credible performances.This is a great,excellent and perfect movie.This is a must see.Rating: 10",10,4,16,10 March 2006
Beasts of No Nation," Beasts of No Nation
","In this century, various movies which pretend to denounce the terrible social and economic conditions in Africa have been made (such as Hotel Rwanda, Blood Diamond and, to a certain point, Lord of War). More recently, Beasts of No Nation reminds us that the problem remains... even though it never reveals where the story is developed or what the ideologies of the factions in conflict are. That's an audacious strategy, because by omitting geographical or temporal details, the narrative gains universality and avoids the moral dilemmas of the conflict between 'good' and 'evil' ones. Who is right doesn't matter; the consequences are the same for the innocent victims who are absorbed by military (or para-military) machinery which requires a constant renewal of troops in order to perpetuate a hollow crusade in which violence seems to have become an end in itself. Sure, I thought about all that after Beasts of No Nation was over. While I was watching it, I found myself frequently confused, with the sensation that I had missed something important because I didn't understand who was fighting against who, and I didn't know the motivation of the rebels or the defensive troops. However, I later realized the fact that the point of the film isn't the political diffusion, but sharing the main character's naive perspective, who is one day into imaginary games, and the next one is brandishing an assault rifle to shoot people he doesn't know for reasons he doesn't comprehend. The effect is simultaneously devastating and curiously distant, coldly examining the events without contaminating them with moral judgements or cultural rationalizations... exactly like a kid would do. Abraham Atta brings one of the most honest and natural performances I have seen this year, not only when he shows up on the screen, but also during his brutally revealing narration. The rest of the cast also makes an excellent work, highlighting Idris Elba. The technical aspects are also brilliant, contrasting the horrors of war with the beauty of African settings. Dan Romer's music highlights some scenes, but, like Cary Joji Fukunaga's direction, it never tries to artificially exalt the audience's emotions. In fact, that can be considered the mandate of this extraordinary movie: portraying a sad reality without seeking solutions or offering false hopes. The situation exists, and it would have been disrespectful to seek Hollywood formulas to solve it. There is no happy ending, but at least, there's an ending. Sometimes, that's the biggest blessing.",10,3,5,3 December 2015
Gone Girl," Gone Girl is a satisfactory and quite interesting thriller
","Many people adore director David Fincher, but I'm not one of them. I generally like his films, but I don't consider myself an unconditional fan of his. Gone Girl, his most recent film, is a very good addition to his filmography, because besides of having a refined style and various solid performances, it tells us a cleverly twisted and perverse story, where there aren't good or bad people, but different levels of victims. However, I found the first hour from Gone Girl a bit generic... the 'husband accused of homicide' subject is kinda trite, like taken from an episode from Law and Order. But then, the twist comes, and the movie comes to life, filling itself with energy which is kept until the ending. I had previously never swallowed Ben Affleck as an actor, but I have to admit that he brings a credible performance in Gone Girl, and he's well complemented by Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry and Kim Dickens. As for Rosamund Pike, who plays the missing wife in flashbacks, her performance is irregular; she feels excessively feigned in some scenes, but in other ones, she transmits devastating levels of melancholy and hopelessness. One of the elements I appreciated the most in Gone Girl is the tense music from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Or I might be saying 'soundtrack', because more than 'music', Reznor and Ross created 'aural landscapes' with percussions, noises and electronic cadences which twitch the nerves and make us participants of the anguish and concern all the characters experiment on a higher or lower degree. In conclusion, even though the first hour feels a bit generic, Gone Girl quickly recovers itself in order to bring us an intense, satisfactory and very interesting thriller, which I consider worthy of a recommendation. Besides, from a personal point of view, Gone Girl became another subsection in the long list of reasons why I prefer to be single.",8,0,9,3 October 2014
The Lives of Others," Amazing film
","I have not seen much movies which talk about the life in Democratic Republic of Germany before the fall of the Wall of Berlin,but of the little quantity of films I saw about that subject,they fall on cheap propaganda(with the excellent exception of Goodbye Lenin).It's difficult to say they are guilty for that but,it's nice to see an excellent(or,at least,good)movie about that subject which does not show the facts,but that they show events and situations inspired on real life and leaving the spectator the homework of taking out conclusions.The amazing film The lives of others does that and a lot more which make it a unique experience.The experience this movie brings is totally fascinating from the beginning until the end.The script is well written,the film counts with an excellent and detailed direction and with perfect performances.Ulrich Muhe and Sebastian Koch are excellent on their performances and they have a very precise attention to the details on their performances.The lives of others is an excellent film...one of that pleasures the seventh art gives sometimes.",10,1,2,22 March 2007
Room," Room
","Screenwriter Emma Donoghue (adapting her own novel) designed an intriguing structure which makes Room difficult to categorize. Is it a thriller, a domestic drama or a character study filtered through an unusual perspective? Don't worry; it's a rhetoric question, and I prefer not to get into too many details, because the less the spectator knows, the better the story will work. So, I will just say that Room is a provocative and very interesting movie with an innovative premise, amazing performances and solid direction. The story is generally developed through the eyes of the kid Jack, something which offers an incomplete vision of the facts; but thanks to the screenplay and Brie Larson's extraordinary performance, we can quickly fill in the holes in order to realize the scale of the situation and the way in which the main characters assimilated it. But that's just the beginning. It can be said that the 'conventional' ending of the film happens during its half, creating a brusque and significant thematic and narrative transformation which brings new challenges to the screenplay and the performances. Fortunately, both elements work, and they take us to an ending which isn't necessarily happy, but definitely satisfactory. As I previously said, Larson makes a magnificent work in her role (in my humble opinion, she should have already won an Oscar for her performance in Short Term 12), while the kid Jacob Tremblay also brings an excellent performance, absolutely natural and convincing from the beginning to the end. On the negative side of Room, it was a bit difficult for me to adapt to the second half after the suspense of the beginning; but that's when the previously mentioned character study comes into scene, and once I comprehended that strategy, I recovered my interest. Even though I liked Room pretty much, I don't have particular wishes to watch it again; however, it deserves a recommendation because of its originality and unusual execution. And, personally, it confirmed me the damage the trailers make to the films they pretend to sell. If you are interested in watching Room, don't watch any of its trailers.",8,1,6,20 February 2016
The Incredibles," This is a great animation film that it's fun for kids and for adults
","Various years ago,I saw The iron giant,a movie I really loved.When I knew that Brad Bird,the director of that fantastic movie,was going to do The Incredibles, my expectations got really high,and I ended up liking the film very much.It's not as good as The iron giant,but I have to say that this animation film is fun for kids and for adults.Pixar is definitely the best North American animation studio.It is almost at the same level of Studio Ghibli(the Japanese studio created by the great Miyazaki,whose filmography includes Princess Mononoke,a masterpiece).Both studios are way better than Disney,because Disney doesn't care about the story,they only care about the toys of a movie,while Pixar and Studio Ghibli care about telling a good story.The Incredibles is a great animation movie,fun for people of any age.",9,0,0,16 June 2006
The Hurt Locker," An excellent war film
","Despite all the acclamation poured into The Hurt Locker, I started watching it with pretty much skepticism, because I think the Irak war has already been examined in cinema from all the possible angles, not to mention that the protests against it feel increasingly tiring and irrelevant (even though they are right).However, The Hurt Locker ended up being a fascinating experience because of its innovative subject, lack of dull ideology, excellent performances and specially, because of Kathryn Bigelow's intense direction.One of the things I most liked in The Hurt Locker is that it does not pretend to instruct us about the failed reasons of the incursion in Irak, or repeating oil conspiracies or complaining about the lies about the weapons of mass destruction.It is simply focused on the experience from three soldiers specialized in disabling bombs, and it leaves us to interpret the situations from our points of view.And it also shows us brilliant scenes of action and war suspense.During the first seconds of The Hurt Locker, screenwriter Mark Boal establishes the message from the film: 'War is a drug'.And during the rest of the film, he shows us the effects of that addiction, making a realistic portrait of the dehumanization provoked by the uncertainty of combat, the impersonal management of the soldiers in the army and the psychological afflictions provoked by the horrible life conditions during war.But all those messages are set in the background from the movie, assimilating themselves to the spectator's point of view.On that way, the main attractions are the incredibly tense missions from the soldiers and the brilliant performances from the cast who interprets them.Jeremy Renner brings a very detailed development, which lets us see his character as a likable and competent man, but who is truly devastated in his soul.Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also excellent, since they completely become on their characters.By the way, the marketing from The Hurt Locker emphasizes the presence in the cast from Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce and Evangeline Lilly, but their roles are so short that they could be considered as cameos.I understand that strategy, because the main actors from this film are relatively unknown, and in order to raise the profile from this movie, they hired famous names; however that could disappoint the spectators who expect to see Fiennes or Pearce as the centre of attention, when reality is very different.But really...the performances from Renner, Mackie and Geraghty are so powerful that I barely noticed the stars on their fleeting appearances.What takes me to the real star from this film: Bigelow.The filmography from this director includes some of my favourite movies (Near Dark, Strange Days and Point Break).However, in early 2000s, her career declined with two mediocre movies: The Weight of Water and K-19: The Widowmaker.However, after that low period in her career, Bigelow makes her return to glory with The Hurt Locker, at the same time she created precise, energetic and very exciting action scenes in this movie.However, I have to make clear that the action of The Hurt Locker is not based on massive battles, confusing shootouts or heroic displays of machismo.Compared with the excesses from directors like Michael Bay or Stephen Sommers, Bigelow's action seems slow and methodic...but it is infinitely more striking because of the emotional weight from this film.Besides, Bigelow creates an appropriate sensation of anguish on the action scenes, which perfectly shows the nightmare of being at war.The only complain I have against this film is that it has a few irrelevant moments.But that does not avoid me from giving a very enthusiastic recommendation to this excellent movie, which is absolutely worthy of the acclamation it is receiving.",9,52,82,28 January 2010
No Man's Land," A great movie

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A good movie but far away from the excellence
","I generally start watching very long movies with distrust,because various of them try to betray us,making their story unnecessarily longer than what it should be to cover fails from the screenplay or the simple fact that they do not know what to say.On the other hand,there are long movies we wish they would never end,because every second makes the previous one richer and the characters become on something like old friends from the spectator.I think The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is on some intermediate point.This is a good movie,I do not deny it,but it is far away from the excellence and,although I liked it,it has various fails.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button tried to be a version of Forrest Gump for 2008.The main characters of both movies see the world from a different sensibility and they also have a physical condition which makes them different to the people they interact with.And what The Curious Case of Benjamin Button also shares with Forrest Gump is the very good manufacture.On this movie,director David Fincher shows a deep attention to the details, and the special effects are excellent,not only because they are perfectly done,but also because they work as a support for telling the story.I also appreciated on this movie that the narration from the voice of the main character results likable and appropriately subtle.But,at the difference of Forrest Gump,the main character results too bland.I mean,there is nothing which makes us emotionally connect to him.I think that the screenplay failed in constructing a deep character.Besides,this movie occasionally falls on cheap sentimentalism which was unnecessary.The consequence is that that moments do not feel honest...they feel forced.And there are various parts on this movie which felt irrelevant.On that parts,it seemed the film was going nowhere.I think the best element from this movie are the performances.Brad Pitt made a good work but I think the best performances are on the supporting cast.I usually like the work of actress Cate Blanchett very much and she did an excellent work in here.But I think the member of the cast who mostly stands out is Tilda Swinton.She completely becomes on her character and she could perfectly transmit all her emotions.Taraji P. Henson (who had left me astonished with her performance on Hustle and Flow),Jared Harris and Julia Ormond also bring solid works.I did not totally understand the main point from this movie...is it a romance?,is it a magic fable?,or is it simply a collection of vignettes without too much meaning,made with the only porpoise of winning Oscars?.I honestly do not know.I think it is a little bit of all that.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a good movie but it is far away from the excellence.Although I liked this movie,it did not result very memorable to me.",7,1,2,7 February 2009
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures
","With this review, I would like to express two ideas which seem contradictory: 1) The story told by Hidden Figures is inspiring, interesting and very relevant for the current political climate of the United States; 2) The way in which Hidden Figures tells that story is too elementary and predictable, and it occasionally feels the opposite to its message. Narrative simplicity doesn't necessarily contradict the important themes of a film; the problem from Hidden Figures comes from the fact that it reduces the story to a series of clichés which dilute the true events in order to fit into a commercial formula. That's a useful strategy, because it makes the movie more accessible, and it extends the diffusion of its message (the Oscar nominations it received will also extend that diffusion). However, Hidden Figures runs the risk of becoming a didactic pamphlet which only seeks an easy and quick emotional reaction, instead of fully exploring the complexity of the events it portrays. Nevertheless, Hidden Figures managed to keep me entertained with the minimum necessary effort, connecting the key points of the story with enough eloquence to keep the audience's attention. Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monáe and Octavia Spencer bring excellent performances in the leading roles, and I would also like to mention the solid works from Kevin Costner, Aldis Hodge, Mahershala Ali, Jim Parsons and Kirsten Dunst in supporting characters. So, Hidden Figures was made with good intentions, and it deserves a moderate recommendation because of its performances, its message and for portraying a little known chapter of the space programme, acclaimed as one of the most important human triumphs... but only for a certain type of humans. Hidden Figures reveals the other side of the coin, and that excuses its bland structure and weak conviction to a certain point. I think that this story would have been more suitable for Taylor Hackford, Spike Lee or similar filmmakers with more passion than patience for political correction.",7,0,4,4 February 2017
Sing Street," Sing Street
","An amateur music band in Dublin during an economic crisis? Am I talking about a remake of The Commitments? No, Sing Street isn't a remake, but the influence of that masterpiece is noticed in various aspects... something which isn't bad at all. Sing Street shares cultural elements with The Commitments, but it immediately finds its own personality, besides of adopting an enough different musical style in order to avoid unfair comparisons to any other 'garage band' tale. I enjoyed the multiple sub-plots of Sing Street very much; and even though they don't belong to my favorite type of music, I certainly appreciated the ingenuity and talent behind the original songs played by the characters. The historical period (the '80s), geographic setting and socio-economic environment justify the strong influence of the 'new romantics' which used to be popular during that decade, bringing songs which imitate the style of Duran Duran, Joy Division, The Cure and Spandau Ballet, with some North American references such as Hall & Oates; but, independently from their origin, I found all the songs excellent (I still have 'The Riddle of the Model' spinning around in my head). The whole cast makes a brilliant work, highlighting Lucy Boynton, who perfectly transmits sweetness and charm as the 'muse' of band, and Jack Reynor, who steals every scene he's in (besides, I was left with wishes to see a film exclusively focused on his character). In conclusion, Sing Street tells a compelling and honest story which employs music as a genuine complement of the narrative, instead of being a simple ornament. My favorite movie from director John Carney keeps being Once, but Sing Street still deserves an enthusiastic recommendation, specially to those of us who once played (badly) in the garage (or roof) of some house, making more noise than 'music'. Sing Street understands the magic of those moments, and it accompanies them with a subtle echo of social commentary, bringing a fascinating and memorable experience which combines nostalgia and raw reality. And a huge love for the music.",9,1,2,15 December 2016

The Imitation Game," The Imitation Game
","The story about the Enigma code is fascinating, not only because of its technical details, but also the colorful persons who were related to it and the huge effect they had in the conclusion of World War II. That's why I was interested in watching a 'prestige' film about that topic; however, The Imitation Game ended up being more superficial than I expected in its handling of a theme which might be too arcane for mainstream cinema. In other words, The Imitation Game was afraid to scare the audience with too much science, and it preferred to exaggerate the drama in order to obtain a warmer and more accessible narrative. I understand the making of that decision, but it makes the film feel a bit incomplete. Nevertheless, there are various attributes in The Imitation Game, such as the excellent performances and the well defined characters. And there's also some romance, but I'm glad to say that the resolution of that sub-plot didn't end up being as predictable as I had expected, because it's also employed to reflect on other topics, which are very distant to war and cryptography, but at the same time, equally important in their historical context. Benedict Cumberbatch makes a perfect work in the leading role, transmitting many emotions with his expressive face, and he's well complemented by the rest of the cast. However, I wasn't left completely satisfied by The Imitation Game, because I found its screenplay excessively light and lacking of genuine ambition. Screenwriter Graham Moore made a decent work, but he didn't have the audacity of taking the cryptographic subject as a starting point to create a memorable narrative puzzle, instead of limiting himself to cover the basic requirements of a functional but kinda insipid biopic. Anyway, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to The Imitation Game, because despite not being something special or highly memorable, it has enough positive elements, and it tells an important story for contemporary world, not only for the effects it had on World War II, but also for establishing the bases of the digital culture we nowadays enjoy (or suffer) every day.",7,2,5,7 February 2015

Logan," Logan
","Logan has already become one of my favorite superhero films... even though it doesn't really look like a superhero movie. It would be more appropriate to describe Logan as a western, or a drama, or a tense thriller which would still work without the fantastic elements, because there's no need for mutant powers to comprehend the desperation of a man tormented by his past and with an uncertain future lacking of any hope... until hope finds him. But, hope of what? Of redemption? Of survival? Or of briefly returning to the brutality and violence from which he attempted to escape? The simple fact that Logan inspires those questionings reveals its narrative deepness and emotional complexity, both of them rarely seen in the occasionally frivolous world of superheroes. Hugh Jackman confirms once more that he was born to play Logan/James Howlett/Wolverine. The benefit of the years (I'm equally talking about the age of the franchise and Jackman's) have allowed him to create a credible and natural evolution of the character throughout 9 films (well, he barely played cameos in X-Men: First Class and X- Men: Apocalypse, but I'm still counting them), and that's a probably unique case in universal cinema (not only in comic adaptations). But Jackman is only one of the brilliant elements of Logan; we also have the excellent screenplay, solidly structured with 'classic' elements (the retired hero must return to action; the hero considers his powers a curse, etc.) which feel fresh due to some unexpected inversion of roles and the intentional distancing from the comic archetypes which are becoming routine in this kind of movies; don't misunderstand me: I keep enjoying the films from Marvel Studios, but it's already time to change the recipe a bit... something achieved by Logan with an excellent result. I also liked the fact that the antagonists aren't megalomaniac super-villains with vague plans of planetary conquest (or something like that), but individuals who are 'normal' to a certain point representing extreme manifestations of the vices of humanity: intolerance, obsession with control, selfishness. Another thing I liked was the austere vision of the year 2029; instead of exaggerating the futurism and the science fiction, director James Mangold presents us a world which is the same to the one of 2017, but with small visual details supporting the story. In conclusion, Logan isn't a perfect movie, but I enjoyed it very much, and it definitely deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation.",9,1,4,4 March 2017
Big Fish," A good film but a little overrated
","My favorite movies directed by Tim Burton are Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow.Ed Wood is a tribute to B movies from the 50's and Sleepy Hollow is a tribute to the horror films of Hammer.In Big fish,Burton uses his original style,at the same time dark and innocent.But,the result is a good but not great movie that,by my point of view,it could have been a little better.The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has a lot of imagination.But now,I'll mention the weak things I found on this movie:the characters' emotions are not very deep.For the other sight,Burton seems more interested on showing all the imagination the film has that in telling a good story.The film feels a little cold and without the sense of humor that films like Beetlejuice or Pee-Wee's adventure had.Big fish is not a bad movie;I have to say it kept me fun and interested but I feel it could have been a little better.",7,6,9,29 December 2006
The Dark Knight," Not the the masterpiece everybody say it is but still,a very good film
","Batman Begins had been a great surprise because I did not expect too much from it and it resulted to be excellent and with a perfect characterization of Batman.So,I had high hopes with The Dark Knight.I did not like this film as much as Batman Begins and it's not the masterpiece everybody say it is but,still,it's a very good movie which is very entertaining and exciting.Let's see the positive elements from this film.The character of The Joker is perfect.It's brilliantly developed and his dramatic arc and motivation are truly perfect.And,talking about The Joker,I have to admit that Heath Ledger (1979-2008) brought a phenomenal performance.Ledger made the character really memorable and there were a lot of moments in which his performance left me astonished (the scene at the hospital proves Ledger was a genius as an actor).It's very sad that he died because he was extremely young and it would have been very interesting seeing Ledger getting the recognition he would totally deserve.The action sequences are very exciting and the direction is pretty good.But,in the last 45 minutes,the movie goes dawn and it looses some points.After Rachel's death,I thought the movie was going to end but it was not like that.The film introduces a second villain and I did not think that was a correct decision because that character is not too well developed and,at the difference of The Joker,you can never know him too well.So,I felt forced that part of the movie.It would have been better if director Christopher Nolan had left that villain for the third part so that he could have been better developed.But,in spite of that,I can recommend The Dark Knight.I do not think it's the masterpiece a lot of people say it is and I liked Batman Begins more but the film is never boring and it brought me a very exciting and satisfactory time.",8,4,8,24 July 2008

Avatar," Entertaining, but not completely satisfactory
","It brings me distrust when a director proclaims: 'Until now we have the technology to tell this story' (or similar words).I ask to myself if Shakespeare, Cervantes or Lovecraft had once said: 'Finally! A blue ink pen! Now I will be able to write my masterpiece'.If the screenplay from Avatar had been extraordinarily good, it would have worked even if it was represented with puppets.But it is not, and the film is supported on many brilliant special effects to simulate the fact that the screenplay is hollow.I cannot deny Avatar entertained me, but I am afraid I will erase it from my memory in less than a week.In mid-90's, a preliminary screenplay from Avatar appeared on the Internet, and I had the opportunity to read it.Director and screenwriter James Cameron said that that primitive draft was completely different to the final version of the movie, but I feel its basic structure is the same: on the one hand, we have the military and corporative villains ready to raze the 'eco-magic' world for the sake of money; and on the other hand, the integration of a human being to the native culture, which does only alter his perspective of the planet, but also from his values and ideology.Sure, I imagine that the descriptions from the flora, fauna and geology from the planet Pandora were increasing their complexity as Cameron found new technological tools to visualize an entire planet.And there is certainly no doubt...the hundreds of millions of dollars the movie cost were well invested on the fantastic images which bring Pandora to life, not to mention that the special effects are also great.Besides, the action scenes are very well filmed by Cameron, because they are always clear and they involve the spectator on them.However, I cannot ignore the fact that the screenplay from this movie is hollow, predictable, full of clichés and packed of unidimensional characters.With the exception of Sigourney Weaver, the cast does not bring very solid performances.Stephen Lang (unrecognizable in comparison with his days on the TV series Crime Story) and Giovanni Ribisi do not bring too much energy and conviction to their characters.Even Sam Worthington (who was so charismatic in Terminator: Salvation) feels listless as the hero.I guess that it does not help too much the fact that, during the 90% of the movie, Worthington is replaced by a digital creature with a similar face but less histrionic talent.I will not deny that the Na'vi race is created with very competent special effects, which surpass on expression and realism to the insipid dummies from Beowulf (2007) and A Christmas Carol (2010), but they are still far away from being perfect.In fact, it took me around 1 hour to 'plunge' myself into the movie and accept them as valid characters.Besides, Avatar has tiring ecological clichés and sentimental formulas which feel too obvious and cloying.However, in spite of its many fails, Avatar is an entertaining experience and I think that because of that it deserves a recommendation.Finally, I think that the inverse proportion which exists between the technical complexity from Cameron's films and their narrative ability is very noticeable, something which is a pretentious way to say that, in my humble opinion, his best films keep being The Terminator and Aliens, because what I most remember from them are the story and the characters, and not only special effects, like it happened to me with Avatar.",7,7,15,1 January 2010
La La Land," La La Land
","I definitely have to join myself to the multitudes acclaiming La La Land as a 'love letter to Hollywood'. I would just add that it's in fact a love letter to the IDEA of Hollywood... not the neighborhood from Los Ángeles full of homeless, drug dealers and 'trannies', but that Utopian 'dream factory' where love is instantaneous, sincere and eternal, and where talent, with a bit of luck, invariably leads to stardom... or at least absolute happiness. It's the same, isn't it? And when we add the musical numbers, the result is a delicate confection which is similar to a cotton candy: delicious but almost intangible. The difference is that La La Land will remain on our palate for a long time due to its sticky songs, excellent screenplay and extraordinary visual style. In conclusion, an unforgettable experience which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation to the fans of cinema and the musicals in general. In the leading roles, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone display their talent and charisma once more, and both form a magnetic couple. And then, we have the wonderful musical numbers conceived by director Damien Chazelle and his talented creative team, including composer Justin Hurwitz and choreographer Mandy Moore (not the one you are thinking about). From the first seconds of La La Land, Chazelle establishes his amazing vision with a musical number set on a Los Ángeles freeway, during the rush hour. And, in case that wasn't ambitious enough, cinematographer Linus Sandgren employs a graceful camera which moves through the scenes like one more dancer, with fluid and spontaneous movements which hide their careful planning. In my humble opinion, the camera work of La La Land rivals the one of Birdman, and I'm not exaggerating. I won't reveal the rest of the musical numbers, but I will just say that each one of them works perfectly to display the music, the actors and, of course, the city of Los Ángeles. The screenplay is perfectly written, and it doesn't only work to introduce the musical numbers, because it tells a very interesting story by itself. And even though Gosling and Stone are the absolute owners of the movie, I also have to mention the presence of J.K. Simmons, Rosemarie DeWitt and John Legend (yes, the one you are thinking about), who bring energy and conviction to their brief roles. In conclusion, La La Land is a brilliant musical movie, and as I previously said, I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm. And, yes, we have already understood that Chazelle loves jazz (his previous film was Whiplash); I suspect that his secret purpose was implanting that musical style into our heads, in which it will remain for many days after leaving the cinema.",10,3,12,26 January 2017
Saw," Great horror movie
","My favorite genre is the horror and last years there are terrible horror movies.But the independent cinema made excellent horror movies like May,The descent and Saw.The movie is very fun,every scene has a surprise and the ending is totally unexpected.The movie is original and I am not going to say the plot because the greatest thing of the movie is discover the surprises with the characters and the ending is unexpected.Everything you believed during all the movie changes at the end.The movie has a lot of potential and this is a great horror movie that it shows us that the best horror movies are in the independent cinema.I completely recommend this movie to fans of horror movies because they will love it.",9,0,1,6 March 2006
Up," Another excellent film by Pixar
","Some years ago,when the animation studio Pixar announced the increment on its volume of production,many of us had the fear that the effort of making one movie per-year (instead of making one every two or three years) would reduce the quality of the screenplays.The results partially confirmed that.Cars and Wall-E were solid films,no doubt,but by my humble point of view,they were not as polished as the other films from Pixar,but Ratatouille was great,and it's my second favourite movie from this studio (the first one is The Incredibles).So,I did not know what to exactly expect from Up.The result was another excellent film by Pixar.This movie is funny,very satisfactory and owner of a remarkable dramatic deepness.The main character is among the best ones from the history of Pixar,because he is very rich on the psychological detail.The visual aesthetic from Up helps to conciliate the fantastic and realistic elements from the story very much.The design of the characters complements their personalities and makes them as expressive as any human being.The moment from the movie in which the house is floating with the help of thousands of balloons is truly extraordinary.What I mostly appreciated from this movie is that its authentic beauty is on the story and its message.The title from this movie is very appropriate...I lead to the conclusion that it does not only refer about the house going 'up',but also to the emotional evolution from the main character.The action scenes from this movie are very exciting and funny,because they put an old man and make him a hero,who results much more interesting than many heroes from blockbuster action films.The fail I found on this movie is one : near the ending,the screenplay has a forced element; I think that should have been done on a more natural way.But,that is not a too important fail,and the only reason I noted it is because the movie establishes a very high standard of narrative quality.Up is an excellent movie which is highly recommendable for people of any age.",9,2,4,11 June 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Another tedious animation film
","Even though I am old and bitter, I can imagine the impact the film How to Train Your Dragon could have on a 5-year-old boy who goes to the cinema for his first time.This hypothetical boy may not know Harry Potter yet, he is not tired of seeing the same story again, and he neither has cultivated a deep cynicism as an answer to the condescendence Hollywood shows for the child spectators.From that innocent point of view, How to Train Your Dragon could be a good experience, with a message of tolerance and a young hero who must fight against his own insecurities in order to triumph over adversity.But to the cynical people like me who are tired of seeing the same formulas, How to Train Your Dragon is another tedious animation film.In this film, we have ANOTHER main character who feels misunderstood, isolated from his community and unable to please his father, until a magical event helps him to discover his potential and brings him the impulse to fulfill with his dream.Big yawn.To be fair, there are a few interesting small things on the screenplay, but the movie unfortunately does not deepen into them.In the technical aspect, the design from the characters is bland, but the animation itself and the special effects are well done.However, I cannot recommend How to Train Your Dragon, because it bored me and I did not like the story.In summary, another proof that, with some exceptions, the current quality of animation cinema in Hollywood is quite poor.",5,19,65,30 March 2010
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Wow,I love this film
","This is a perfect film with a great style.This modern film noir has an original style and I liked that style a lot.Guy Ritchie makes a great work as a director and Sting has a brief,but great performance.Something I liked a lot from this movie is that it has a lot of sense of humor.The ending is hilarious.Jason Flemyng made an excellent performance.I like this movie a lot,because I was totally fun watching this movie and the touches of humor are great.If you want to see an excellent movie with great touches of humor,you should see this great movie.This independent film shows us that sometimes low budgets make more that movies that have a lot of budget but they are pretty boring.",10,0,1,19 March 2006

The Departed," Great thriller
","I went yesterday to The departed's premiere and I really liked it.The movie is extremely fun and the violent scenes are very well filmed.Scorsese has a kinda irregular career:he made great films(Bringing out the dead,Goodfellas,Taxi driver or Raging bull), but also unsatisfactory movies(Kundun,The age of innocence or New York,New York).The departed belongs to the first group.The great Jack Nicholson makes a perfect performance and I think he needs to have another Academy Award nomination for this movie.Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg also bring excellent performances.The departed is a great remake that,without being at the same level of Infernal affair(the original movie),is very fun,with great moments of violence,with great performances and with very unexpected things for the ones who did not see the original film.",9,0,2,13 October 2006
Crazy Heart," Three excellent performances in a mediocre film
","I will say it from the beginning: Crazy Heart is on many aspects a copy of the brilliant film The Wrestler.Both follow a famous mature man in the decline of his career, who is defeated by life and survives thanks to the nostalgia, until a new romance renews his wishes of living and inspires him to look for redemption.I do not know if that similarity is due to the chance or the marketing, and I frankly do not care (to be fair, Crazy Heart is based on a novel written in 1987).Whatever the way it is, Crazy Heart is mediocre, but moderately entertaining, and it offers three great performances.Leaving the comparisons with The Wrestler aside, the story from Crazy Heart tends to ramble and loose the focus.However, we are fortunately in company of Jeff Bridges in the leading role, and his magnificent performance keeps afloat even the most insipid scenes (How many times we must see him vomiting in order to establish the fact he is an alcoholic?).And, besides of Bridges, we have Robert Duvall and Maggie Gyllenhaal, two excellent actors who show credibility and conviction on their roles.However, Colin Farrell is absolutely out of place with his performance in this movie.One of the most important fails from Crazy Heart is that I did not found the romance between Bridges' character and Gyllenhaal's very credible.I said I would not keep making comparisons, but on occasions like this one, that is unavoidable.In The Wrestler, we had two 'broken' people, who had deep emotional scars which on some way made them similar people and also justified their mutual attraction.In Crazy Heart, we have a modest and intelligent reporter falling in love with a finished alcoholic musician.The problem is that the screenplay cannot establish the connection between both characters on a plausible way, so big part of the posterior drama simply feels as a whim from the screenplay.Crazy Heart is a mediocre movie, but the performances from Bridges, Gyllenhaal and Duvall made me to be moderately interested, and I think I can give to it a slight recommendation because of that.However, I cannot deny that the movie lacks of enough deepness and substance, and that is the main thing which makes a bland experience of it.",6,2,5,12 March 2010
12 Years a Slave," 12 Years a Slave is a very solid drama
","Before watching 12 Years a Slave, I feared it to be too depressing, and on some way, it ended up being like that. However, screenwriter John Ridley and director Steve McQueen show us the most terrible sufferings of the slaves without losing of sight the main character's internal fortitude, avoiding the film to degenerate into a hollow parade of pain capable of desensitizing the audience. The excellent performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor (one of my favorite actors, by the way) is focused on keeping the hope alive despite the adversity, and he achieved it with an amazing subtleness in the use of his expressions. The supporting cast also made a solid work, highlighting Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and Paul Giamatti in characters which must have been incredibly difficult to play. On the negative side from 12 Years a Slave, a few scenes feel too sentimental, while other ones feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend 12 Years a Slave as a very solid drama.",8,0,5,1 March 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of Tomorrow is entertaining, but not very memorable
","If we can swallow the fact that Edge of Tomorrow is basically Groundhog Day with aliens, we will encounter an entertaining film with an ingeniously planned screenplay and excellent special effects. And even though that's not enough to make it something brilliant or very memorable, it works properly as a pleasant experience. Co- screenwriters Jez Butterworth, Christopher McQuarrie and John-Henry Butterworth have fun with the temporal loop concept, which allows them to kill the hero in many occasions, and at the same time brings him a kind of immortality which is explored with humor and enough logic in order to excuse the most improbable elements from the premise. And I estimate that that will be the main weak point from Edge of Tomorrow... some spectators will accept the ridiculous explanation about time travel, and other ones won't. I personally found it too forced, even though it brings some interesting dramatic levels to the film. Tom Cruise brings a weak performance in Edge of Tomorrow, because he feels listless and bland. I could never feel the intensity and conviction from his best performances; and it's not even necessary to compare it with his classic action roles in Mission: Impossible or Top Gun. It's enough with remembering the work he brought last year in Oblivion, a sci-fi film with multiple ideas taken from better movies; even there, Cruise showed much more life and passion. By the way, the description of Oblivion also applies to Edge of Tomorrow: a series of burrowed concepts (the temporal loop from Groundhog Day, the mechanic suits from Starship Troopers 3: Marauder, the overwhelming combat from Saving Private Ryan, the cyclic drama from the 'Cause and Effect' episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, etc.), but ready-made in a story with enough personality in order to earn an own identity, as long as we can excuse its most extreme ravings. In conclusion, Edge of Tomorrow deserves a moderate recommendation as an entertaining sci-fi film. However, it lacks of that 'magical touch' in order to be something memorable.",7,1,3,7 June 2014
Downfall," I love this movie
","Downfall is an extraordinary and powerful film experience.Everything on this film is perfect.Bruno Ganz has a perfect performance as Hitler and he is one of the best actors alive and I think he deserved an Academy Award nomination as best actor in a leading role.This is a crude film,because the director wanted to show us how Adolf Hitler was.Under the monster there was a person,that is the message of the movie.The director,Oliver Hirshbiegel,directed a few years ago another excellent movie called The experiment and with this movie he is confirmed as someone very talented.I love this film and I totally recommend this movie because movies like this deserve to be seen.Rating: 10",10,1,3,6 March 2006
Whiplash," Whiplash isn't great, but it's quite an entertaining film
","Every year, the Oscar voters include one or two independent films among the nominated ones for Best Picture; by doing that, they prove the fact that they aren't elitist and that they give the same opportunity to every stratum of production, and not only to the big studios. This year, the film Whiplash was chosen as a sample of the generosity and democracy of the Oscars, and even though I don't think it deserves its nomination for Best Picture, I found it a very entertaining film with excellent performances and a solid screenplay. I would have personally preferred to see Nightcrawler in that 'underdog' position. But, well... let's leave aside my cynicism and bitterness against the Oscars, and let's go back to the many pros of Whiplash. To start with, we have magnificent performances from two great actors who had been a bit underrated in the past: Miles Teller is practically initiating his career, but he has already shown huge talent. The other perfect performance is from J.K. Simmons, an acting veteran who shines in every thing he's involved, and elevates the quality from the projects he participates with his mere presence, either in cinema or TV (yes, I'm one of the few people who enjoyed the sitcom Growing Up Fisher, starred by him). The chemistry between these two actors is electrical, and brings intensity and emotional impact to many scenes. And then, we have the music. I'm not a fan of jazz, but the dynamism and energy of the musical numbers presented in Whiplash infect the spectator. In conclusion, I don't think I would consider Whiplash an excellent film, but I definitely think it's a solid one which deserves to be recommended.",8,0,1,23 January 2015
The Last King of Scotland," A great movie which is perfectly acted
","During the 70s,dictator Idi Amin ordered the genocide of a lot of people in Uganda(the total of victims are between 300.000 and 500.000),which was part of a large list of atrocities which were later revealed to the people.The last king of Scotland tells the events of Idi Amin when he was a dictator but from the point of view of his personal doctor.The result is a great and very interesting movie which deserves to be seen.The movie is very fun,it's never boring and it always kept me interested.Forest Whitaker makes an extraordinary performance and all the awards he received are totally deserved.James McAvoy(who appeared in The chronicles of Narnia)has a difficult character but the actor makes a fantastic performance.David Oyelowo has a great performance as Doctor Juju.Gillian Anderson has a short but excellent performance as an English doctor.Director Kevin MacDonald tells this story shaking reality and fiction on a dramatically efficient way and that results very appropriate.Also,he has a special talent in showing scenes of big impact for their content(like the tour for an Amin's torture room)or for their narrative style(like a persecution in the streets of Kampala).The real locations in Uganda give realism to the film and the atmosphere this movie brings is totally disturbing.The last king of Scotland is a great movie with perfect performances and which is very interesting and has a good level of realism.",9,3,4,13 February 2007
August Rush," It's not bad but it did not convince me too much
","August Rush is not a bad movie but it has various failed points.Let's see them.First of all,the magic realism this movie uses is a cheap trick for telling a story without too much logic and which also is badly raised.Robin Williams brings a horribly irritating performance.Do not misunderstand me.I think Williams is a brilliant actor but his performance in here is inappropriate for the movie.Still,it's not a bad movie.Freddie Highmore brings a good performance and he shows charisma for his role and the movie brings a good and valid message.August Rush has a lot of fails but,still with that,it's not a bad film.I think I can recommend it if you are looking for something entertaining and nothing else.",6,2,3,18 March 2008
The Green Mile," Great and very touching movie
","I thought that The Green Mile was going to be a drama with a lot of cheap sentimentalism but I was very wrong.The movie gives real emotions,not the cheap ones.This movie is very touching(especially on the ending).Michael Clarke Duncan made an extraordinary performance,full of nuances and emotion, with which he steals the movie.The rest of the cast also makes a solid work.The movie never gets boring with a running time of 188 minutes and all that time passed very quickly for me.The green mile is a great movie with solid performances,a solid screenplay and precise direction.In conclusion,this film is worthy of an enthusiastic recommendation.Rating:9",9,0,1,1 October 2006
The Wrestler," A truly perfect film
","The Wrestler is an extraordinary film at the same time it marks the transition of director Darren Aronofsky to a different style than the one of his previous movies.The Wrestler is a more accessible film than Aronofsky's previous movies.Pi,Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain were very unusual movies while The Wrestler is more 'normal'.But this very talented director has made a brilliant work even at a style which is different than the one he is accustomed to.This is a magnificent movie which will stay with the spectator for a long time (well,that's what happened in my case).Basically,The Wrestler repeats the formula from Rocky (or,more precisely,from Rocky Balboa).But putting the main character in the wrestling world makes the story more credible and less archetypal.The down at heel hero who tries to recover his previous glory has been used on many movies; but in The Wrestler,that story feels fresh,unpredictable and absolutely realistic because of some innovative angles the screenplay has.Many people consider The Wrestler as the artistic rebirth of Mickey Rourke,which makes me very happy,although we do not have to underrate his solid works on supporting roles in movies like Domino,Spun and the brilliant Sin City.But the last time we had seen Rourke in a leading role was in 1992,in the movie White Sands.His performance in The Wrestler is monumental and it also helps the fact that Rourke had a period of glory for then living in the shadows for a long time,something which is related to his character.Marisa Tomei also shines on her character because she is completely natural on her role.Evan Rachel Wood also brings an excellent performance because she shows solid range and adequate deepness.Aronofsky's direction is perfect.The style he found to tell the story was completely appropriate,he could obtain magnificent performances from his cast and the scenes of wrestling fights are very well filmed.The screenplay is amazing,not only because it is very well crafted and because it presents a perfect development of the characters,but also because I admired the way in which it shows the wrestling world.For one sight,it accepts the falseness from that sport but for the other sight,it shows the tremendous training the wrestlers have to do,which requires enormous effort.And I also liked the ending very much.I think it should not be taken on a literal way,but as an analogy of the emotional search of the main character.I will not say any more because I would ruin the movie to the reader.The Wrestler is a magnificent and absolutely fascinating movie which shows once more,why Aronofsky is one of the most interesting contemporary directors.This is a great cinematographic experience which deserves all the acclamation it has received.Besides,who cares if Rourke did not win the Oscar ? What it matters is that this excellent actor made an extraordinary work,at the same time he recovered the dignity as an actor many people considered it was lost...and that means much more than a whimsical trophy which has a very doubtful credibility.",10,3,5,3 March 2009
Inception," A very good film, but some fails avoid it from being a masterpiece
","I do not know how I am going to express the various pros and few cons from Inception without revealing spoilers.But well...I will try my best in order not to ruin this very interesting film experience to those who have not seen it yet.To start with, I liked the performances from Inception very much.Leonardo DiCaprio faces his character with naturalness and conviction...in other words, he brings his character to life.The rest of the actors make the same achievement.They are Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the main character's right-handed man; Ellen Page as an 'architect' of dream-like settings; Tom Hardy as a talented counterfeiter; Ken Watanabe as the impassive Saito; Cillian Murphy, who perfectly dominates what is, in my opinion, the most difficult character from the film; and the great Michael Caine, even though what he does is practically a cameo.As good as the cast is, the main pros (and cons) from Inception come from the screenplay, which is a work of an unusual complexity which makes the spectator to pay full attention, and even though it may seem obtuse and matted, it in fact has a very precise logical sequence, which is structured with an attention to every detail.Having said that, I have to mention the presence of holes and inconsistencies which, in my opinion, avoid the film from being excellent.The most important problem comes from the action scenes.Do not misunderstand me...they are exciting and thrilling by themselves.However, they introduce too many rules in the world of dreams, and they make the 'squeak' in the gears from the narrative to be evident, at the same time they distract our attention and interrupt the flow from the story.In order not to give too many turns about that point (since I would necessarily have to reveal spoilers), I will only say that the chases, shootouts and explosions feel forced, and they tend to obstruct a well designed and fluid story.However, even though I did not find it to be excellent, I think Inception deserves a safe recommendation for all the previously mentioned positive elements, and also because of Christopher Nolan's perfect direction.It is not a perfect film experience, but it is worthy to see it mainly because of the screenplay, because it is entertaining at the same time it leaves the spectator thinking.",8,5,14,29 July 2010
WALL·E," A good animation film but I expected more from it
","With The Incredibles,I think the excellent animation studio Pixar made an evolution.With evolution,I'm not talking about the technical aspect from the movie but about the narrative aspect.In The Incredibles,Pixar showed a more mature tone and some adult subjects.After The Incredibles,they had a little false move with Cars and,after that,they made Ratatouille which,as The Incredibles,had some subjects and messages which were not precisely for kids.With all this,I'm trying to explain why I consider Ratatouille and The Incredibles Pixar's best films : on that movies Pixar showed subjects which result very interesting for kids and adults and mature tones which are not common to see on animation movies.Wall-E,Pixar's new film,disappointed me a little bit.Do not misunderstand me : Wall-E is a good animation film with many positive elements but I could not find in here the narrative maturity which made The Incredibles and Ratatouille so special.First,let's see the negative elements from Wall-E.I appreciated the warning this film makes about the future of humanity but I honestly expected that screenwriters Jim Reardon and Andrew Stanton (the last one is also the director) was going to develop that message in a more sophisticated and deep way and not in the same way as all the constant ecological messages from recent years.Plus,I felt the romantic story on this movie a little bit forced.In other words : the love story does not flow naturally.I also found on this movie some irrelevant and redundant moments which result a little bit boring.I have the feeling that Wall-E has its origins as a Pixar short,so when they stretched it,they put some irrelevant moments to fill in the running time.Fortunately,this movie has many positive elements.With the exception of some boring moments,the movie is entertaining and sympathetic.Plus,the main character is very nice,so I could easily empathize with him.On the first 20 minutes,the movie is brilliant,but after that,it goes a little bit dawn.I also appreciated the references to sci-fi films,like 2001.Wall-E is a good animation film which entertained me for the most of the time.But it disappointed me a little bit that,after The Incredibles or Ratatouille,Pixar did not make something more mature and adult.In summary,I can recommend this movie but I certainly expected more from his film.Rating:7.5",7,1,6,10 July 2008
Arrival," Arrival
","It's usually a pleasure to find a 'serious' science fiction film, because we know that it will try to make us think, and it might even teach us something about ourselves. You know... like real science fiction used to do before being usurped by the special effects. Arrival is one of those 'serious' movies, and even though it offers various beautiful images and an impressive production design, the important thing isn't the spectacle, but the ideas it explores, the nature of the characters and the contrasting emotions provoked by the interplanetary 'culture crash'. In other words, Arrival is a vision of the 'first contact' which places more emphasis on the human attitudes than the hypothetical extraterrestrial 'conflict', obtaining a richness of shape and content I had rarely seen in this genre. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer took various common clichés of science fiction in order to rethink them in a format more consistent with the tone of the film; for example, the typical notion of the spaceships arriving at Earth is initially presented without showing those ships, because, during a while, we only see the reactions from the people, the media and, of course, the governments of the world. The whole cast of Arrival brings excellent performances; my favorite was the one from Forest Whitaker, who perfectly captures the internal strength of a sensible and pragmatic military who inflexibly sticks to the rules of the high command. Heisserer perfectly handles the fascinating central idea of the screenplay, until getting to an amazing twist, solidly unifying all the disparate elements of the tale... particularly a family tragedy in the main character's past, as well as the unavoidable romantic hints between the physicist and her. In this case, the romantic sub- plot is an integral part of the narrative, multiplying its emotional impact and accentuating the universal connection theme which leaves us with a bittersweet, but hugely satisfactory sensation, once the film ends. In summary: an extraordinary film which expresses epic science fiction in personal terms. Arthur C. Clarke would have been proud.",10,3,10,15 December 2016
The Blind Side," A very competent family movie
","The Blind Side tells us an inspiring story in the kindest way, which endorsed by competent performances and good intentions, ends up bringing us a nice, conciliator and very entertaining time.The first thing I appreciated on The Blind Side is the absence of sermons and cheap sentimentality, something which avoids the movie to become into a lachrymose melodrama.Besides, the message from the movie is shown on a natural way, because it is filtered into the sober narrative.The Blind Side does not pretend to plunge us into the sordid reality of the North American social system, and it even finds moments of humor into the racist comments from some hateful characters.The main attraction for many people before watching the movie will undoubtedly be the acclaimed performance from Sandra Bullock, which made her win an Oscar.Did she really deserve it? I tend to think she did not, but I definitely enjoyed her work.In a big degree, Bullock repeats her classic routine of adorable mischievous, but on this occasion, she seasons it with a subtle intensity which brings weight and honesty to her character.I truly think this is one of the best performances from her career, and not only for the emotions she generates with her development, but also because she feels much more credible than the uncountable harebrained women she usually embodies in romantic comedies.The fails I found on this movie is that some funny moments feel a bit forced, and that it turns a bit artificial near the end.In summary, I think I can recommend The Blind Side with confidence, because it is a movie which fulfills with its intentions of inspiring, entertaining and even bringing us a slight lesson of humanity in order to appreciate everything we have a little more.",8,0,1,19 March 2010
Despicable Me," It is not highly memorable, but it is entertaining
","Even though the general quality of animation cinema in Hollywood is quite poor, I had some interest in watching Despicable Me, because its voice cast included some solid comedians (Steve Carell, Jason Segel, Will Arnett, Russell Brand and Kristen Wiig), so I thought they would bring their personality and humorous instincts to what seemed to be another bland family story.And they made a good work, but to my surprise, the film also ended up being entertaining and nice.I guess I am not the only member of my generation who is tired of the modern childish entertainment, designed by marketers, psychologists, lawyers and pedagogues in order not to 'trauma' or impress the children too much, or inevitably damaging their frail minds (at the same time they are prepared for the delights of the consumerism).So, I always appreciate the slight efforts of films which dare themselves to introduce a little bit of 'edge' in the shape of black humor, funny misanthropy or a simple subtext which will not be understood by little children.And even though Despicable Me does not posses a high level of subversion or audacity, it at least adds a healthy dose of those elements to its predictable story, and those brief moments of twisted laughs are what I most enjoyed from it, along with the voice acting.On the other hand, the screenplay feels a bit weak and inflated with the accustomed filler of slapstick humor.There are scenes which work well, but other ones lack of imagination, and their only purpose is introducing noise and action in order to liven the slowest moments from the story.For the rest, co-directors Pierre Renaud and Chris Coffin drive the film at a good rhythm, and I also appreciated some deep details from the screenplay, like the relationship between the main character and his mother, Dr. Nefarius' seriousness and the satire of a bank which finances arch-villains to their own benefit.I think that I liked Despicable Me for those interesting details, and not so much for its cloying main story, with adorable (translation: a bit irritating) who soften the heart of someone who is not really bad...only misunderstood.However, I think this movie deserves a recommendation because, even though the final experience is not very memorable, I cannot deny it kept me entertained the whole time.",7,0,4,31 July 2010
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton
","My limited knowledge about hip-hop (or whatever it's currently called) is limited to the occasional collaborations of rap/metal implemented during the '80s and '90s by groups such as Aerosmith/Run D.M.C., Beastie Boys/Slayer and Anthrax/Public Enemy. Leaving that aside, I occasionally used to watch some minutes of Yo! MTV Raps!, but it has never been a musical genre I'm particularly interested in. So, I don't pretend to evaluate the veracity of Straight Outta Compton as a musical biopic, and I won't describe it on the basis of my personal tastes or any nostalgia. I will simply say I found it an exceptional movie which precisely captures the contagious energy of a new musical style whose influence would go much farther than anyone had expected... including its fans and haters. The structure of Straight Outta Compton follows the standard of any 'road to fame' tale, with its obligatory scales on Triumph, Betrayal, Tragedy and Redemption. But the story isn't as important as the History (with capital letter)... the portrait of a moment in time when the seeds of a turbulent future which has unfortunately not changed very much were sowed. That's why I found it fascinating to witness the key points of this social/cultural revolution, accompanied by dynamic music, solid performances and F. Gary Gray's brilliant direction, whose deceptive simplicity hides an admirable attention to the details in the recreation of facts which still resound nowadays, proving that, like critic Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr once said, 'the more things change, the more they stay the same': rap and hip-hop dominate popular music; but the racial tensions in the United States remain in the same degree as when they inspired Ice Cube to write his most famous song. One of the things I liked the most about Straight Outta Compton is the fact that it dedicates the same care to the sequences in concert of N.W.A. and the racial clashes between policemen and youngsters in the black neighborhoods of Los Ángeles. Actors O. Shea Jackson Jr. (who plays Ice Cube, his father in the real life), Corey Hawkins, Jason Mitchell, Neil Brown Jr., Aldis Hodge and R. Marcos Taylor make a perfect work in their roles, bringing hypnotic and absolutely credible performances. In conclusion, I'm not going to say that I will start listening to rap music after having watched Straight Outta Compton; however, I enjoyed the experience very much in each one of its aspects: didactic, visceral, narrative and musical.",9,2,26,13 February 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," An excellent conclusion of the trilogy
","In 2005, the film Batman Begins...no...One moment!...The Batman films directed by Christopher Nolan don't require an introduction, because they form one of the most acclaimed film trilogies in modern History, and I think that the three of them are very good movies thanks to their excellent performances, somber tone and dramatic intensity. Having said that, even though I liked The Dark Knight, the second film from the trilogy, pretty much, I don't admire it as much as many people do. And even though I keep considering Batman Begins as the best film from this trilogy, there's no doubt that The Dark Knight Rises is an excellent film which satisfactorily concludes the trilogy and leaves the door open for future re-interpretations of this iconic character.The Dark Knight Rises bombs with information, characters and events which generally enrich the narrative, even though they occasionally obfuscate it. The first 30 minutes from The Dark Knight Rises incorporate us very well to the situation in Gotham and to the role of the characters in a social setting which might have less crime, even though it's not lacking of injustice. The movie keeps being well developed despite a few minor fails; and the last 45 minutes are genuinely extraordinary, not only because of the action, but also because of the screenplay's ability to tie the loose ends and solve the tangled story with an impressive congruence, making the spectacle not to obstruct the performances nor the delicate characterization of the characters. Besides, as a fan of Batman in the comics, I appreciated the inclusion from various elements taken from the sagas Knightfall and No Man's Land.I also liked Batman's kinda reduced appearance in The Dark Knight Rises; even Bruce Wayne takes a supporting role during some passages, letting the weight of the story to rest on the other characters. On some way, this reduces the quantity of action and stunts, but it reminds us of the fact that the 'bati-universe' created by The Dark Knight Rises and its two previous films isn't based on traditional super-heroic exploits, but on the characters' internal conflict and on the drama generated by the crash of classes and ideologies in the realistic context of Gotham. Christian Bale brings a perfect performance once more as Batman in this film, but Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and the great Joseph Gordon-Levitt also bring excellent performances. Tom Hardy didn't have too much opportunity of displaying his performance with the mask he wears in here, but his physical development in the action scenes is solid. On the female aspect, Marion Cotillard brings an adequate performance, while Anne Hathaway makes a competent work as Catwoman.In conclusion, The Dark Knight Rises is a highly recommended film, because of Nolan's magnificent direction, the solid performances and the brilliant screenplay, even though it occasionally takes some unnecessary tangents. In summary, a fascinating experience which is worthy of admiration.",9,3,8,28 July 2012
Iron Man," A good super hero movie but nothing too special
","I did not have high expectations for Iron Man.I had the feeling it was going to be a crap like Hulk or Daredevil.Luckily,the movie surpassed my expectations and it resulted to be much better than the two mentioned films (which is not a difficult achievement)...but the movie is nothing special.First,let's start with the good points of the movie.The best element from this movie is Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark.Downey Jr is a brilliant actor and he showed a lot of charisma and enthusiasm on his character.I think he made this movie better than what it really is.I also thanked the movie is focused on the human aspect of the main character and not only on his super hero face.But,this movie has some important fails.I found the action scenes weakly filmed.They never reach big impact or big excitement,so that scenes feel cold.Also,the excellent actors Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges are wasted on their roles.Iron Man is a competent film and much better than what I expected but that's not saying too much.I can recommend it as a good entertainment which has nothing memorable or special.",7,5,10,6 May 2008
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3 is a wonderful film
","With Cars and Wall-E, I saw a declination in the narrative quality of the studio Pixar.Do not misunderstand me...I liked them both, but I did not feel in them the charm from films like Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo or The Incredibles.After Wall-E, Pixar made the brilliant Up, which is in my humble opinion, one of the best movies made by the studio so far (I think the only ones which surpass it are Ratatouille and the previously mentioned The Incredibles).So, I did not know what to exactly expect from Toy Story 3...was it going to be made by the magic Pixar or the solid, but not highly memorable Pixar? Now, after having watched the movie, the answer is definitely the first one.Toy Story 3 is a wonderful, very satisfactory and hugely entertaining film which is ideal to be watched by the whole family...and the best thing of all is that, at the difference of many contemporary animation films (like Madagascar or Planet 51), it never insults the audience's intelligence.Toy Story 3's brilliant screenplay is enriched by deep subjects which are hidden behind the characters' adventures, jokes and rescues, which are the key element which distinguish it (along with all the other Pixar movies) from many hollow animation films.The voice acting is very solid, and the members who most stand out are Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton and the great Ned Beatty.Another thing I liked very much is the animation, which respects the style from Toy Story 1 and 2.In films like Wall-E and Up, Pixar showed it can achieve extraordinary levels of realism on that field, but not because of that they felt obliged to take Toy Story 3 to those levels.Sure, the elements and the illumination feel more natural, and there are many visually impressive scenes; but the general look from the movie keeps the same tone and style from the first two parts from the trilogy.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few narrative elements feel a bit out of place.But that is a minor fail which not in any way tarnished the great experience I had while watching this film.Needless to say I enthusiastically recommend it.",9,3,5,19 June 2010
La Vie En Rose," Monumental performance by Cotillard but the film is only good
","Actress Marion Cotillard brings an extraordinary and monumental performance as Edith Piaf in this film,La Vie en Rose.But,aside from that great performance,the film is not great and,with the exception of Cotillard's performance,I could not find something memorable about it.La Vie en Rose is a little bit boring on some scenes and the film commits the fail a lot of biopics have:it shows Piaf's life but it never shows her motivations and psychology. I think that some of the biopics which avoided that fail are Kinsey,Capote and Veronica Guerin.Still,it's not a bad movie and,except some moments,it's entertaining.La Vie en Rose is a good film but,with the exception of Cotillard's extraordinary performance,I do not find something memorable in it.",7,0,0,5 March 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," A great movie I totally recommend
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a brilliant animation film with a charming 'retro' animation, a fascinating screenplay and sparkling voice acting from the whole cast (the members who stand out are, by my point of view, George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Bill Murray).Fantastic Mr. Fox is based on a book written by Roald Dahl (1916-1990), one of the few authors who have enjoyed quite a luck with the film adaptations from their books.Movies such as The Witches, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) respected on a big degree Dahl's unusual tone of prose, oriented to children but never condescending or simpleton.Fantastic Mr. Fox is an addition to that honourable group thanks to the irreverent humor co-screenwriters Wes Anderson (who was also the director) and Noah Baumbach brought to the screenplay, stylishly merging the adventure destined to the childish spectators with commentaries on adult subjects.The first thing which strikes in Fantastic Mr. Fox is the rudimentary style of 'stop motion' animation employed to bring the characters to life.This old technique has been replaced in the two last decades by the more efficient digital animation, but even the few movies which are still made with 'stop motion' (such as Coraline or The Corpse Bride) show a perfect manufacture which is mistake-free and polished to the point of sterility.On the contrary, Anderson and the effects supervisor Tim Ledbury chose a more simple and organic system which stresses the craft value of that discipline, and it makes the 'mistakes' (such as the characteristic 'rippling' which is noted on the models as a consequence of its manipulation during the animation by hand) to take part into its charm and personality.And the same applies to the ingenious models which work as scenarios and backgrounds, which are full of funny details which do not obstruct their work of creating an imaginative and consistent set.However, Fantastic Mr. Fox offers much more than attractive images.Its screenplay is surprisingly mature for a family film, and even though its characters are anthropomorphic animals, they are not used as excuse to reduce the level of the narrative.On the contrary, the adventures of Mr. Fox are exciting and very entertaining, but what I mostly liked was the dynamic with its wife and son, as well as its interaction with friends, enemies and the rest of the community.The result is an absolutely fascinating film experience.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few elements from the screenplay are not very well polished.But that minor fail did not avoid me from enjoying Fantastic Mr. Fox very much.I totally recommend it, because even if we ignore its multiple levels of narrative deepness, we basically have an hilarious comedy with nice characters, brilliant dialogs and a hugely entertaining screenplay.We really need more animation movies like this one.",9,1,3,10 May 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Force Awakens
","It just took 32 years, but we finally have a good Star Wars film. To start with, J.J. Abrams' direction is perfect, very well balanced between the action sequences, the dramatic scenes with genuine dramatic weight (yes, I was touched in more than one occasion) and the epic sensation that we are witnessing the rebirth of the saga. The performances are brilliant, from the old acquaintances to the new faces who will inherit the franchise. Needless to say, there are pretty much references to the original trilogy and a big care dedicated to the multiple tributes, but the main task of the film was preparing us for the future, something it did very well without losing of sight the foundations of Star Wars, both in the figurative (the fight between Good and Evil, the function of the Force) and practical (the space battles, the creative aliens and exotic planets) senses. What is more, co-screenwriters Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt created the intriguing beginning of a trilogy which, besides of that, tells a fascinating story on its own merit. And even though the ending feels unavoidably inconclusive, it leaves us with a very satisfactory emotional note which foreshadows the huge potential of the sequels. The previously mentioned 'old acquaintances' show absolute conviction in their iconic roles, while the new faces also make an excellent work, starting by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, who feel credible in their roles while having an excellent chemistry with each other; Oscar Isaac has relatively few scenes, but he quickly earns the empathy from the audience; and Adam Driver perfectly transmits Kylo Ren's terrible internal struggle. I also have to mention the extraordinary production design, which continues the general style from the original trilogy, but forging its own retro- modern aesthetic, always respectful of continuity and without the digital fetishism which tarnished the prequels so much. Even though I liked Star Wars: The Force Awakens very much, I have a few small complaints against it. The nostalgia occasionally interferes with the flow of the screenplay, specially when it's not limited to jokes or visual details, but segments of the dramatic structure. My second objection is regarding some aspects of the screenplay, which is interesting, deep and amusing, but it occasionally employs a few slightly irritating coincidences I couldn't accept. Fortunately, those small complaints didn't avoid me from enjoying Star Wars: The Force Awakens as much as the original trilogy; maybe more, because the nostalgic weight and fear of disappointment were combined in this occasion to make the experience more intense and cathartic. In summary, a brilliant rebirth of the Star Wars saga which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation, and which I would definitely place among the best films I have seen this year.",9,12,42,18 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A satisfactory and very entertaining conclusion of the saga
","I am going to explain my general posture about the cultural phenomenon Harry Potter, in order to give some context to this review, which will be positive; but maybe not as positive as the opinion of the fans who grew up with this saga, and who are acclaiming this last movie as a milestone of universal cinema. Anyway...I found the first three Harry Potter books to be moderately good inside the parameters of juvenile literature, but as the saga advanced, I noticed some loss of in the control of the narrative, which introduced characters and 'ret-con' without rhyme or reason, trusting the reader not to ask for any explanations nor an adequate development of those elements. Nevertheless, author J.K. Rowling could conclude the saga on an emotionally satisfactory and dramatically consistent note. As for the film adaptations of the books, my reactions for every one of them were also irregular, because there were occasions in which the movies tried to very faithfully follow the books...something which duplicated the missteps, 'deus-ex-machina' and forced 'suprises' from their literary counterparts. So, my big doubt was...Would Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 minimize the cons from the book and maximize the pros? Fortunately, the answer ended up being positive, even though I do not consider it to be perfect.The basic premise from this film starts simple in order to later become more complicated with multiple adventures, action sequences, romance and the obligatory visits to the past which generate new narrative tangents or try to justify some characters' behaviors. Some of those digressions genuinely enrich the story and tie loose ends which had been crawling from a decade ago. Other ones look like simple excuses to introduce more extraordinary special effects, or to visit some popular actor from the supporting cast, or in the worst of the cases, to create forced dramatic moments which were difficult for me to digest, even though some of them are better raised in here than in the book. However, screenwriter Steve Kloves knew how to 'tighten the nuts' from the story, and he abandons any filling during the final 45 minutes in order to fully explore the darkest passages from the entire saga. I have to say that the general result Kloves achieved in here is pretty good.The technical aspects from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 are brilliant. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is excellent, and I think that he could achieve an adequate balance between the 'fairy tale' visuals we saw in the first films, and the colder and more severe atmosphere which started to be employed when the 'dark side' of the saga appeared. As I previously said, the special effects are magnificent. And finally, John Williams' music fulfills with its purpose of accentuating the emotions deployed in every scene.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson show that they have not only grown up on the physical aspect, but also on the histrionic one. They are totally credible in their roles, and they have a very good chemistry with each other. As for the adult cast, my favorite performances in here are the ones from Maggie Smith and the great Alan Rickman, who both bring excellent works.8 months ago, I found Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 to be so slow and dramatically inert that it bored me very much, and that it considerably reduced my expectations for the final chapter. After all, I do not care very much if a movie is faithful to the book it is based on, provided that it finds its own 'voice' and becomes into a solid experience which does not require any comparisons nor cooperation to its written version. After 7 movies of a variable level of quality, I think that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is the one which could most achieve that, and even though it will definitely be more appreciated by the fans of this saga, I can recommend it also to those ones who do not memorize every book, nor saw the previous films more than once, because it is a satisfactory and very entertaining movie by itself.",8,0,2,15 July 2011
Unbroken," Unbroken
","I vaguely remember having heard Louis Zamperini's name regarding his Olympic fame, but I completely ignored his story as an allied bomber during World War II. His devastating experiences in combat and after having been shot down are certainly inspiring, and they undoubtedly deserved a film... but I think that the film Unbroken couldn't make justice to that story, because despite its solid manufacture, it isn't able to evoke an emotional answer on the audience. Besides, allowing myself some cynicism, Unbroken seems to have been designed to win Oscars, and that erodes the honesty of the film, which already feels cold and distant, even more... exactly the opposite of what we would expect in a film about 'the triumph of human spirit'. On the one hand, the absence of sentimentality and narrative frivolity denotes a considerable respect for the hardships suffered by the characters; but on the other hand, such lack of empathy ends up making the film a historical pamphlet which is informative and well produced... but hollow and forgettable. The performances are also a factor in that sensation of coldness. Jack O'Connell, Domhnall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund don't feel credible in their roles, and they can never transmit the psychological havoc of their characters' situation, or the internal struggle they had to go through. In conclusion, I appreciated the didactic intention of Unbroken, as well as its polished manufacture. This film didn't bore me, but it feels more like an impersonal History lesson than as an endearing and human tale. I can give a slight recommendation to Unbroken, even though I feel that having spent half an hour in Wikipedia reading about this story would have provoked the same effect on me.",6,7,10,31 January 2015

What We Do in the Shadows," What We Do in the Shadows
","Strictly speaking, What We Do in the Shadows is another horror pseudo-documentary (at first sight), but its sense of humor and naughty execution bring it closer to the style of sitcoms such as The Office and Parks and Recreation, and the final result is an unusual film with likable characters, sharp humor and very appropriate observations about the clichés of horror cinema. Thanks to that ingenious combination of elements, What We Do in the Shadows feels very different to the usual 'found footage' films. The hand-held camera technique adapts itself quite well to the screenplay, and there is no need to make any traps to follow the characters, even during the most 'extreme' moments of paranormal activity; and when the camera can't be present, we always have the alternative of the 'recreations'. Some people might say that What We Do in the Shadows has a diffuse screenplay lacking of a formal structure; in other words, there isn't too much story, and besides, it occasionally rambles between abrupt events and periods of a certain slowness; however, I think that was an intentional decision in order to highlight a 'reality' which doesn't have predetermined dramatic arches, but the arbitrary ups and downs of daily life which even vampires can't avoid. Discussions about dirty frets; how dealing with a temperamental 'roomie'; reaching an agreement on which nightclub to go... those are the narrative blocks of What We Do in the Shadows, and even though they don't always fit correctly, I estimate that the point of the film wasn't telling a linear story, but evoking the coexistence between eccentric characters who combine the bloody nature of the traditional vampire with the clumsiness from 'nerds' who are outside society and unable to adapt themselves to the fast changes of contemporary civilization (at least until someone teaches them to use cellphones). It might sound strange, but I found What We Do in the Shadows similar to Only Lovers Left Alive; the tone from both films is very different, but their characters equally suffer the social isolation and emotional loneliness which define them beyond vampirism itself. However, What We Do in the Shadows adds the humor of the trivial in order to balance the tragedy of eternal life. Or as eternal as it can be in company of distracted friends who leave the windows open.",8,0,2,28 April 2015
Moon," A truly extraordinary sci-fi film
","At first sight, Moon looks like an hybrid between 2001 and Silent Running, but I think it would be unfair to say that, because although it shares some narrative and stylistic elements with those two classics of the sci-fi genre, its story is totally different, and it presents fascinating ideas about human identity and the function of memory as the individual basis.Besides, this extraordinary film has brilliant moments of suspense, humor and a perfect atmosphere of loneliness.Revealing too much about the story from this film is forbidden, because big part of its attractive is on the gradual discovery of data and events which clear the situation from the main character, and they offer a fascinating psychological study.And something which helps that psychological study to be so interesting is Sam Rockwell's phenomenal performance.His performance is so credible and natural that the spectator feels identified with the events his character lives.I think this is Rockwell's best performance to date, something which means a lot when we contemplate the fact he has brought many excellent performances as interesting characters like, for example, the pusillanimous cowboy of The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford or the multifaceted murderer from Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.I hope that his monumental performance in Moon will get recognized by the Oscars and other awards, because he would really deserve it.Even though we only hear the voice from Kevin Spacey, he also made a very solid job by finding the perfect grade of personality and indifference the robot GERTY needs to express the 'feelings' trapped between conflictive directives which test its conscience.I also have to applaud the detailed models which represent the lunar surface, and the perfect cinematography which complements the illusion of scale and deepness.I liked to see that, on these times of visual excesses, someone decided to exploit the innocent tools from decades ago, corrected and improved by some digital touches.The best elements from this film are definitely Rockwell and the brilliant screenplay, which challenges our expectations and is based on fascinating ideas in order to express a deep and interesting message.In the tradition of the best science fiction, Moon combines intellectual challenges with an excellent narrative to bring a reflection on human condition.This film is a real masterpiece, and it is one of the best ones I have seen this year.So, Moon deserves the most enthusiastic of the recommendations, because it is hugely entertaining and it leaves us thinking at the same time.We need more movies like this one.",10,5,9,28 November 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A very interesting and entertaining movie
","I am very happy to see the sudden critical acceptation director Danny Boyle is getting for Slumdog Millionaire,because I have liked his entire filmography (with the exception of The Beach) and I feel that many of his films have been unfairly underrated for not adjusting to the spectators' expectations.Nobody denies the greatness from Trainspotting but his also very interesting films Shallow Grave,A Life Less Ordinary,28 Days Later and Sunshine were underrated from my point of view.Slumdog Millionaire is another very interesting and entertaining film from Boyle which,in spite of not being excellent,it is near from being.During the first half hour from the movie,it disappointed me its repetitive structure and the convenient way of how any question from the programme is magically related to a past event of the main character's life.However,that fail is compensated a little bit because when I started thinking about the movie,I noted that was made with the intention of showing the chaotic life in India,from the childhood from the kids of Mumbai to the impact the occidental culture has had on that country.Another function from those vignettes is showing the relationship between three young people during their unpredictable lives on which their separations are as important as the moments they are together.That is a very good strategy,because it makes the screenplay richer but at the same time,I think that aspect could have been worked a little bit better,because it reminded me to the style shown in the extraordinary movie City of God,which used that strategy a little bit better.However,the charisma from the actors and their honest performances emotionally connect to the spectator,and that made Slumdog Millionaire to provoke an unusual emotional impact on me.Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy used a very ingenious trick : starting the movie with what it seems a posterior event to the TV programme,suggesting the final result and making us believe that he killed us any suspense.However,that was only an intelligent manipulation from Beaufoy because,near the ending,nothing is as it seemed and the film gets incredibly tense until it leads to a very satisfactory conclusion.Boyle's dynamic direction perfectly complements the tone from the movie.It is obvious his intention was not emulating the narrative language from Bollywood (with the exception of the final credits) but incorporating his style to the exotic Indian sensibility,and it is a testimony to his extraordinary talent that so different films like Sunshine (human sci-fi),A Life Less Ordinary (a violent and modern fairytale),28 Days Later (horror for the new millennium) and now Slumdog Millionaire show the exact same vision.Slumdog Millionaire is not Boyle's best film (by my point of view,that one is still Trainspotting) but still,I can recommend this movie with confidence because it kept me very entertained and interested,at the same time it exposed a very good message.Rating:8.5",8,0,5,21 February 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max: Fury Road
","Mad Max: Fury Road is exactly what I expected from a prequel/reboot of the Mad Max saga: action from the beginning to the end, with a dense emotional core which brings substance to the chases and creates interest for the laconic characters who say little but express a lot. Mad Max: Fury Road basically consists on a 120-minute chase, in which the vehicles rarely stop; however, the perfect screenplay creates a fascinating dramatic arc for the main characters, offering them emotional moments which end up being as memorable as the magnificent action sequences. Some examples: Max's 'thumbs up', the bag of seeds, an old lady's hussy smile... they are very brief details, but their accumulated impact makes the film hugely more satisfactory than other blockbusters full of special effects. What takes me to the amazing chases and stunts from Mad Max: Fury Road. Director George Miller has wide experience with these frantic chases through Australian outback (even though they were shot in the Namibia desert this time), having made the three previous Mad Max films. However, it is possible that, until now, thanks to the invisible fusion of digital effects and practical stunts, Miller could finally translate what he had imagined many years ago... and the result is truly extraordinary, not only due to the explosions, body-machine combats and exuberant vehicles design, but also because of the beautiful cinematography and absolute clarity in the flow of the action and the development of car battles... even though we might have to call them otherwise, because the only 'automobile' recognizable as such is Max's Interceptor; all the other vehicles are insane mechanical frankensteins, each one of them more bizarre than the previous one... and even like that, beautiful in their twisted primordial aesthetic. And then, we have the excellent performances. It can be said that the authentic leading role belongs to Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, with Tom Hardy in the supporting role of Max, but I don't see the point of establishing hierarchies; their characters are equally essential to the narrative, and their perfect performances immediately capture us into their adventures (and dis-adventures). Hugh Keays-Byrne brings an appropriately grotesque attitude to the villain, and I also liked the performances from Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Zoë Kravitz; on the beginning, they seem to be employed as mere 'eye candy', but eventually, the actresses make those characters feel like credible human beings with well defined personalities, something which hooks us even more into the narrative and makes this '2-hour chase' a genuine tale of freedom and personal redemption... not to mention the strong feminist subtext which is apparently bothering some people. I don't understand them, but they are entitled to their opinion. In conclusion, Mad Max: Fury Road is a violent and somber movie, but with abundant spirit and humanity which compensate the cruelty of post-apocalyptic life. This is definitely one of the best films I have seen in recent years, not only because of the action and the characters, but also because it triumphantly re-establishes a fascinating world, which is simultaneously simple in its needs and complex in its evolution. I hope Mad Max: Fury Road earns the necessary money to make the planned sequels become reality; there is a lot of dramatic material to justify them. Besides, I need more doses of visual poetry with claws and a flamethrower which never runs out of fuel.",10,4,14,18 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Hacksaw Ridge
","The true story of Desmond Doss undoubtedly deserves a tribute, but Hacksaw Ridge manipulates the facts in order to fit into a classic war cinema structure: the rookie with good intentions who suffers the disdain from his partners and superiors, in order to later earn respect in the battlefield. Sure, the key difference of Hacksaw Ridge is that Doss' religious beliefs didn't allow him to kill, or even touch a weapon, something which made his military career even more difficult; but everything else is developed exactly in the way we have seen in too many war films. The avalanche of clichés makes the first half of Hacksaw Ridge occasionally a bit tiring, and it contributes to Doss' excessive simplification. I guess it was necessary to show the experiences which made him become an obstinately pacific man, but the screenplay feels so artificial that Doss ends up looking like a less endearing Forrest Gump. That's how we have a fight with his brother which almost concluded on a tragedy, an alcoholic and violent father (brilliantly played by Hugo Weaving) and a search of internal peace through the Adventist religion. Needless to say, those are valid motivations, but co-screenwriters Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight present them on a cold and artificial way, like a list of ingredients, instead of incorporating them to the natural development of an individual with strong moral convictions. Fortunately, all that changes during the second half of the film, in which director Mel Gibson overwhelms us with a brutal and bloody vision of war which doesn't only capture the struggles of combat, but also the chaos and hopelessness which torment soldiers. I won't say more than that in order to preserve the best moments of Hacksaw Ridge; but I can assure that the weak first half is compensated to some point by the visceral and emotional impact of the battle scenes. Andrew Garfield brings a good performance as Doss, credibly transmitting his character's transformation from a pusillanimous innocent man to a hero, while Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Richard Roxburgh also make a credible work as officers who find Doss infuriating, incomprehensible and even offensive. In conclusion, Hacksaw Ridge is definitely very far from being on par with classic war movies such as Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line, but it still deserves a moderate recommendation, mainly for portraying such a peculiar fragment of World War II, proving that courage doesn't necessarily require aggression.",7,1,6,5 January 2017
Gladiator," Great movie
","This movie is excellent.Russell Crowe makes a great performance but I think the best performance on this movie is made by Joaquin Phoenix.He is so great as the bad guy that you hate him.Well,I think this is an excellent movie with great performances and very fun.Oliver Reed(1939-1999) died while the filming of this movie and the scenes after his death are made digitally by computer and by a double.Richard Harris(1930-2002)makes a short,but excellent performance as the emperor Marco Aurelius.Djimon Hounsou made an excellent performance too as a slave friend of Maximus.The film is sad in some moments,for example the ending in which Maximus dies and when his wife and son are murdered.",10,0,1,3 March 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Very fine drama which does not fall on cheap sentimentalism
","The stories about fight against adversity tried to inspire humanity from its beginnings.But, with the creation of movies and television,they transformed on a simple thing which manipulates emotions.Sometimes,there's a movie that avoids on falling on that following a good story and almost redeeming that cheap genre.The pursuit of happiness is one of that surprises that,without being perfect,produces emotion on the spectator with a great work from all the actors.This film is based on real events and,luckily,Steve Conrad's screenplay feels honest without cheap sentimentalism and it does not have the clichés this kind of movie usually has.There is not shallow drama or villains.There are good performances,realistic situations and a story which progress on a natural way making that the spectator can feel identified with the main character's evolution,his triumphs and failures.Will Smith brings a great performance.Jaden Smith(Will Smith's son on real life)has a very natural performance.Thandie Newton shows conviction on her performance.And the supporting cast brings realistic performances.I found two failures on this movie:the first one is that,on some moments,the film is too slow.The second one is that the film could have been a little shorter.The pursuit of happiness is a fun movie and it can inspire without manipulating the emotions.Italian director Gabriele Muccino made a honest drama and I recommend it because the film brings a good experience.",8,0,1,30 January 2007
The Martian," The Martian
","The Martian is one of my favorite novels, and I had the fear that its homonym film adaptation wouldn't reach the amazing details of the book, its accessible handling of complex scientific concepts and, specially, the main character's pleasant 'voice', who we end up knowing intimately after sharing years of his thoughts and emotions. On some way, my fears were correct; screenwriter Drew Goddard necessarily summarizes the premise and sacrifices many situations which seemed indispensable on the written page; but what we have is still a fascinating tale about touching tenacity and triumph of the human spirit. It doesn't matter whether the main character lives or dies... what matters is the fact that he never gives up. I'm not going to point out the differences between the book and the film; I'm sure there will be many articles about that on the Internet, analyzing and comparing both exhaustively. I will just mention that, on the beginning, the screenplay of The Martian feels a bit rushed. But that's a minor complaint which doesn't darken the many pros from this film, such as the excellent performances from the whole cast, highlighting Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain and, specially, Matt Damon as the eponymous 'martian', who perfectly managed to balance his character's optimistic personality with his fear and occasional discouragement. Ridley Scott's direction is brilliant, and the special effects transport us to Mars with an impressive realism and scientific discipline. I also have to point out the fact that there isn't any fantasy or science fiction in The Martian (with the exception of the existence of crewed missions to Mars). In other words, don't expect any aliens or space battles; just an excellent tale about heroic human beings with the powers of science and determination. And a good sense of humor in order not to get mad into the loneliness of the red planet. Where's Dejah Thoris when you need her?",9,5,53,3 October 2015
The Fighter," A splendid film
","I am not a fan of boxing, but I understand the irresistible attraction it exercises on many people, including filmmakers who try to capture all the drama, pain and passion generated into the ring in the big screen. Boxing is an undoubtedly difficult sport, which cannot be practiced by anybody; and even though it requires many sacrifices, it can also offer extraordinary rewards (at least under Hollywood's affected interpretation). So, the best movies about boxing have a perfect combination of emotion, drama and action...as we can now see in The Fighter, an extraordinary film which departs a little bit from the formula, but without ignoring the traditional elements which can make this sub-genus to be cathartic and satisfactory.In films like Rocky, Cinderella Man and The Wrestler, the fight in the ring is a metaphor of the real fight from the main character, either if it is for going out of poverty, for showing his personal value or for recovering the dignity which was snatched to him by life in other aspects. But in The Fighter, the fights are a peripheral element, because the real conflict is not on the ring, but in the modest suburbs from Lowell, Massachussets, where the characters must face emotional disputes and take hard decisions which will deeply affect their future as well as their family. Do not misunderstand me...the fights are fantastically filmed, and they brought me great moments of hope, tragedy and suspense. But the most memorable scenes (at least by my point of view) were not the punching, falls and miraculous recoveries, but the dramatic confrontations from the main character with his brother, his mother, his trainers, his girlfriend, and other people who only wanna see him triumphing, even though they do not coincide in the way he must take to achieve it.Before watching The Fighter, I was fearing that it would be a simple boxing rehash of the brilliant film The Wrestler, which was directed by Darren Aronofsky; and my fears were accentuated when I found out that Aronofsky himself was a co-producer of The Fighter. However, after having watched this movie, I have to say that there is nothing to fear of...even though both films have a vaguely similar story, their style and atmosphere are very different. The only things they have in common are the high quality from the performances and the emotional impact they provoked on me. Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale bring excellent performances, and the acclamation they both received is absolutely deserved. The supporting cast also made a perfect work, starting by Melissa Leo and Amy Adams as the mother and the lover (respectively) from the main character. I also liked the work from Jack McGee very much. And finally, the unknown actresses who interpret the 7 daughters from the Ward family also made a brilliant work, and they bring some of the most dramatic and also some of the most humorous moments from this movie.I also liked the previous work from director David O. Russell, but I think that The Fighter is definitely his best movie so far. One of the things I most liked from The Fighter is the style employed by him, which is fluid and dynamic but at the same time incredibly thorough, capturing the big dramatic moments as well as the small and eloquent details which fill in the narrative holes from the story's periphery with a casual precision, enriching the narrative and increasing the dramatic weight from every scene. It is like watching a story through a filmmaker's eyes; it supposedly should be always like that, but while I was watching The Fighter, I noticed that that is unfortunately something that rarely happens. In conclusion, The Fighter is a splendid film which deserves a highly enthusiastic recommendation for succeeding so much in every single aspect.",10,2,4,18 February 2011
High Fidelity," A perfect romantic comedy
","It's really awesome to find a romantic comedy which breaks all the clichés,going far away of the traditional formula and,finally,bringing an excellent film,at the same time funny and deep for bringing an analysis of love.High fidelity does that and it's a perfect romantic comedy.This film has funny moments but,principally,I think this is a study of characters in which we see different characters and their interactions become on the most important element of the film.To make more evident this aspect,the main character speaks all the time to the spectator.For some people,the sensation will be strange but we transform on his confidents trying to explain us(and explain himself)why is he so immature.Director Stephen Frears brings to this movie,that sophistication he brings all of his films.The performances are excellent.John Cusack makes an excellent work in the leading role.Iben Hjejle(who surprised me a lot in the film Mifune)is simply perfect and she brings a lot of details to her performance.But the great Jack Black steals the film.His performance is awesome and he can be more than the typical comic relief.High fidelity is a perfect romantic comedy and I totally recommend it.",10,0,1,10 March 2007
V for Vendetta," Great film
","Alan Moore made great comics.The previous adaptations of his comics were The league of extraordinary gentlemen and Constantine,two horrible films.But the third adaptation of one his comics called V for vendetta is great.The action scenes are superb and it has a great story,very well constructed.James McTeigue makes a great work as a director and the cast has great actors like Hugo Weaving,Stephen Rea,Natalie Portman and John Hurt.After the horrible screenplay of the horrible movie Matrix revolutions,the Wachowski made a better work.I totally recommend this movie,because it is very fun and it has a great story.And that is something strange in the actual cinema.",9,2,5,8 April 2006
