Hereditary," Style over substance -- but what rich style!
","'Hereditary' wants very badly to be a smart, allegorical horror-film. It is gloriously weird, and visually striking to boot -- but it never can quite make up its mind what it's about, and so it ends up being mostly about the fun of watching a really weird movie, for whatever that's worth to you.That is to say, it's a film which tries (but fails) to transcend its genre trappings. Which doesn't make it a bad film -- rather, I'd describe it as a pretty great B-movie of the arthouse-horror sort. It's just kind of a shame that it's not better, because there's a lot of good material here, and much of it is sublimely creepy, thanks to excellent cinematography, fantastic performances, and some very effective sound-design.The story begins as a portrait of an artist and her family, as they recover from the loss of her mother, who lived with them in her final years. Annie, the artist, was never particularly close to her mother; at her funeral, she admits in her rememberance speech that she always found her mother a 'secretive and difficult woman.' A surprising number of people turn out for the funeral, which demonstrates the extent of her mother's secretiveness. That, and frequent appearances of a mysterious rune, clue us in early that 'mother' might have been involved in some kind of cult.Annie's daughter, Charlie, is a slightly misshapen girl of thirteen, awkward in dress and habit, and suffering from such a keen social disorder that it seems likely she has autism. In the wake of grandma's death, she has taken to sleeping in the odd treehouse in the backyard, where she seems to think Grandma's spirit resides. 'You were Grandma's favorite,' Annie tells her. 'She didn't want to have anything to do with the rest of us. But you, you were special.'Annie's son, Peter, and her husband, Steve, also figure largely into the story -- but to reveal too much more would be to give too much away.Suffice to say, 'Hereditary' plays out as a surreal, supernatural Greek tragedy, in which every member of Annie's family will inexorably inherit a curel fate. However, the theme that 'Hereditary' is most successful at exploring is the way that individual family-members can damage each other, either on purpose or by accident -- and the way those wounds can create lasting resentments and loss of trust. If the film were only about that, it might be a stronger work.But at a certian point, the film blithely introduces certain B-movie horror tropes which just seem goofy when contrasted with the film's more original material. For one, an outrageous 'seance' scene which moves the film all-too-suddenly into 'Insidious' territory. For another, well, let's just say that the film devolves into a tale of demonic possession which never quite succeeds at being anything more than the usual tales of that sort.Also, there's a thread about mental illness. Maybe certain characters are mentally ill? And a thread about, ahem, heredity, and what fearful things might be handed down through generations. And when Annie's husband dismisses her suspicions late in the film, is the film trying to say something about female agency? There's a lot going on here. It's not necessarily bad that the film brings up all these notions without delving into each one, it's just frustrating that the film never seems to resolve into a satisfying thematic focus.All of that said, there is undeniable pleasure to be found in watching a film which is as stylistically refined as this one is. The imagery makes bold use of color, which is a far cry from the standard desaturated look of modern horror films. The score careens, unhinged. One character's 'tongue-cluck' tic is used to nerve-wracking effect. The family's house itself is somehow sinister in its endless number of hallways and doors.And then there's this: Annie, the artist, creates immaculate dioramas of houses, of rooms, of her own house, of personal moments in her life. It would seem that she processes her emotions through the creation of these scale-model simulacrum of her life. The film finds an interesting visual gimmick in exploring these dioramas, and placing us inside of them, only to then reveal that we're looking at the actual spaces. The effect is a distancing one; it removes us from the action; it gives us the sense that the entire film is taking place in dollhouses of one form or another.I feel like that visual gimmick neatly describes both the pleasures and the problems with this film. It's an astonishing visual, but the 'distancing' effect it creates seems to work to the detriment of the film's action, and for no good reason that I could discern. Why does the film keep comparing full-size spaces with their scale-models? Why do the filmmakers want to distance us? Are we supposed to question the reality of what we're seeing? If so, why? I'm not sure the film provides answers to these questions, or even quite realizes that they're being raised.You see what I'm saying. The film is largely style over substance. But fortunately, style counts for a lot in a horror film, and 'Hereditary' has that in spades.",7,7,13,18 June 2018
This Is the End," Like a single joke that goes on and on...
","Maybe I'm getting old -- but I found 'This Is the End' to be way too long, and not all that funny. I more or less like Seth Rogan, James Franco, and Michael Cera, but this movie feels like a single joke that just goes on and on. How many jokes about farts and semen and dicks can you hear before they're just not funny anymore? I guess for these guys, and perhaps for most audiences, the answer is 'a whole lot.' I dunno. I need some actual wit to sustain my interest in a comedy. There is nothing like that to be found here; just extremely obvious jokes about weed and bodily functions.It's not an entirely unpleasant film; these guys obviously had a lot of fun making it; I mildly enjoyed watching them clown around and have a good time -- but after about the first 30 minutes, I started to feel more and more like I was watching a very expensive version of one of those improvised 'movies' that kids sometimes make over a weekend with someone's dad's videocamera. At a certain point, I found myself impatiently looking at my watch. If you must see this film, I strongly recommend that you wait for it to appear on Netflix. You won't have missed a thing. On the contrary: You'll have saved yourself $9.50!",3,5,12,4 August 2013
Midnight in Paris," A smart, warm, funny ribbing of nostalgia.
","I don't generally consider myself a fan of Woody Allen, and I'm not one of those romantics who gets all misty-eyed at the thought of 1920s Paris. I was more than a little surprised, then, to discover how deeply I enjoyed this film! It's smart, funny, full of heart and interesting ideas.In this typically deadpan and chatty Woody Allen comedy, a middle-aged American named Gil (Owen Wilson) is visiting Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachael McAdams) and her parents, as well as a couple of her friends. Gil has made some good money as a screen writing hack, but he yearns for a more artistic kind of achievement, and so he's been trying to write a novel. He is delighted by the city, finds all his romantic yearnings awakened by it. His fiancée and her family, meanwhile, are put-off by his romanticism; their experience in life is more superficial; they take- in the city as if on a guided tour, groaning about the inconveniences and the rich food, shopping for antiques, as if the entire trip only represents to them a kind of status-symbol, a collection of items and experiences they can use to say, 'I am of that kind of class.'Gil's book, it seems, is about a character who runs a nostalgia shop. His fiancée sees this as an indictment of his desire to live in the past, and she may be right about that. Gil is particularly in love with 1920s- era Paris, that time and place where a crop of reckless young artists were crafting their foundational works -- the roster including names like Earnest Hemingway, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Cole Porter, Picasso, Dali, Bunuel.Late one night as Gil is walking alone on the Parisian street, he is approached by a curious old 1920s Peugeot. The cabin opens and one of the riders, in period dress, invites him inside. With no explanation, Gil is whisked away to a party in another time, where he discovers that the man playing the piano is in fact Cole Porter, and that the Fitzgeralds he is speaking to are, in fact, THE Fitzgeralds.After a dizzying night meeting his heroes, he finds himself back in his hotel room, confounded but inspired. And soon, the pattern repeats: By day, he humors his fiancée and her family; by night, he talks and drinks and dances with his heroes in 1920s Paris.Gil soon meets a girl in the 1920s, and this brings a romantic crisis into the plot. But for much of its runtime, the film simply has fun simply following Gil amongst these people, and contrasting his meek artistic yearnings to those of his heroes, whose sudden living presence reveals them to be perhaps more human than he'd imagined. In a sequence that I truly relished, Gil has a nonsensical conversation in a cafe with Salvador Dali, Louis Bunuel, and Man Ray. To these three famous surrealists, Gil confesses that he is from another time, the year 2010. 'So far, I see nothing strange,' says Man Ray.The film is full of moments like these, and Allen's film assumes the viewer's familiarity with its subjects. Had someone warned me about that, I might have expected the film to fly right over my head. But no, actually, I found much delight in these scenes, and I was surprised by how many of these famous artists I knew. I suppose it helps that I have read some Earnest Hemingway, and am familiar with the Fitzgeralds, as well as Cole Porter and the surrealist painters. What I guess I never quite realized, however -- which this movie aptly demonstrated for me -- was just how many talented folks lived and worked and reveled within that city at that time. It certainly was an era of artistic abundance.The film also has fun ribbing the very idea of nostalgia. 'Nostalgia is denial, denial of the painful present,' says a friend of Gil's fiancée, as they stroll around the grounds of Versaille. 'It's the erroneous notion that a different time-period is better than the one one's living in.' Later, Gil will find people in the 1920's who pine for a period 20 years earlier. And then, in that period, he discovers folks who pine for the Rennaissance. We always think our own era has no imagination, the film argues. Even our artistic heroes thought that of their own eras.Anyway, it's an intelligent and funny film, and I definitely recommend it",9,0,0,7 June 2017
Ant-Man," Fun Like a 1950's Pop-Sci-Fi Fantasy
","Given the fact that I'm quite sick of superhero movies, I was surprised to find how thoroughly l enjoyed 'Ant-Man.' This is the most fun I've had at a superhero film since probably the first 'Avengers.' In fact, I may have liked it better than 'Avengers.' I might even call it my favorite of all of the Marvel films.There are quite a few reasons I found Ant-Man so appealing. For starters, I liked the fact that it tells a small-scale story, centered mostly around a guy, a heist, and his training to perform the heist in a desperate effort to win back visitation rights to see his daughter.I also liked the fact that the stakes are relatively small, at least on Marvel's terms. At some point in the film's chain of logic, the fate of the world would indeed be at stake, but the biggest threat that presents itself in the film is a dude who just happens to have a suit very similar to Ant-Man's suit. Likewise, the most meaningful thing at stake isn't the safety of the world, but a father's relationship with his daughter.This is a Marvel film that puts a lot of emphasis on the characters. That it does so without lacking in action, comedy, suspense, or the expected trappings of a Marvel film, is quite a nifty trick.Another nifty trick is how the film turns its absurd premise -- 'A dude can shrink but maintain his normal strength, AND he can control ants!' -- into a playground of fun, knowingly ridiculous moments and situations. The film doesn't try to excuse its own ridiculousness, or shy away from it. It just presents itself as ridiculous, and has a lot of fun doing things that way.I really admired the effects-work in this film. While many Marvel films appear to be saturated with wall-to-wall CGI, the effects in Ant-Man have a tangible quality about them. I have no doubt that a great amount of CGI was used in this film, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they used practical effects wherever possible; the film has that kind of visual 'weight.' It looks like real things are really happening. I can't honestly say that about most of the Marvel films; even though Marvel often does a bang-up job with CGI, and even though the results are usually pleasing to look at, they often don't feel 'real.' That might be by design. These are, after all, comic-book films. But I much prefer the visual effects in Ant-Man to any of its Marvel predecessors.The effects involving Ant-Man's interaction with ants -- especially when he's shrunken to their size -- are especially great! All odds would point to these scenes being extremely unconvincing. However, director Peyton Reed, however improbably, makes these sequences SING. Watching one of these scenes, with Ant-Man infiltrating an anthill and trying to make psychic contact with its denizens, I put the plot and the context of the scene out of my mind for a moment, and just watched action on screen, in purely compositional terms. It was a fantastic blend of 1950's pulp-SciFi book-jacket art, and Salvador Dali-esque surrealist spectacle. It's hard not to wonder what the film's original director, Edgar Wright, might have done with material like this. Wright, who is known for his impeccable visual stylings and clockwork-tight filmmaking, might have made something even better out of such stuff! But Reed, or his filmmaking team, definitely had a strong vision for these scenes. What could have easily been the film's weakest element, in their hands, becomes one of its greatest strengths.I also enjoyed the sheer fun the film has exploring common household topography from an ant's perspective. The 'shrinking man' film trope dates back to the 1950's, I think, and there's always a bit of kitch involved whenever Hollywood decides to recycle it. How long has it been since there was a successful movie about 'shrinking' people? Was it as far back as 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids?' At any rate, the 'shrinkdown' effect is particularly well-imagined here, giving us a sense of how Ant- Man finds himself suddenly swallowed-up by empty space every time he shrinks, how in the matter of an instant, the bottom of a bathtub impossibly expands to become a vast, desolate flatland.There's a sequence later in the film when Ant-Man must 'go subatomic,' which is a no-no akin to 'crossing the streams' in 'Ghostbusters.' The visuals accompanying his subatomic trek are the purest kind of cinematic joy. Imagine the 'zooming through the Monolith' sequence in 2001, updated for today's audiences, and done really well. My only complaint was that this sequence was too short. I could have gone on watching it for several minutes!I caught the film in its 'RealD' Digital-3D presentation. I don't usually prefer 3D; usually I avoid it. But here, I was surprised by how effectively the film uses the third dimension to express the scale of Ant-Man's surroundings. Visually, this movie is all about 'scale.' When the film is in action-mode (which is much of the time), its every shot is designed as a way of contrasting the size of one thing with the size of another. The film's use of 3D in assisting with that effect is fantastic. I don't usually recommend a film's 3D presentation, but if you don't mind wearing those silly glasses, Ant-Man uses 3D very, very well.It should go without saying that Marvel films always contain 'extra scenes' during and after the credits. This one contains two such scenes, and you'll definitely want to stick around for them.",8,3,11,25 July 2015
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A Fantastic Bore. A failure in the storytelling dept. Disappointing.
","'Fantastic Beasts' is a fantastic bore. I harbor no grudges against J.K. Rowling; I mean, I enjoyed the Harry Potter film series as much as most Muggles. But man, her first post-Potter film is just a mess.The film plays out in what seems like a series of trailers for itself. There are suggestions of excitement, and suggestions of drama, and suggestions of a film that I'd actually like to see! Unfortunately, the film has given itself far too much ground to cover, and so it can't spend any time delving very deeply into anything. Every scene has been reduced to the shortest possible version of itself, no beat is allowed to develop naturally; the film whisks us from one half-baked scenario to another, never pausing to develop its characters or its world into anything more than the most skeletal versions of themselves. Which is all a shame, really, because there was quite a bit of potential here, and this film needn't have been half the mess that it is.Positive notes first: The casting is good. Eddie Redmayne has the right kind of nervousness and dry wit to inhabit the character of Newt Scamander, the film's protagonist, who keeps a magical bestiary in his briefcase. Katherine Waterston puts just the right amount of tomboy into the character of Porpetina 'Tina' Goldstein, a witch who becomes Newt's friend and accomplice. However, the characters of Newt and Tina are kind of boring, as they're not very well developed and all they talk about is the plot.More fun is Dan Fogler as Kowalski, a 'No Maj' who works at a canning- factory, but who dreams of opening a bakery. As a non- magical person who gets caught-up in the film's events, Kowalski is essentially the audience's voice or perspective in the film; his sense of wonder is, at least theoretically, our sense of wonder. Also entertaining is Alison Sudol as Queenie, Tina's flirty, telepathic sister, whose developing crush on Kowalski provides at least a shred of genuine humor and warmth to this overstuffed film.Also good is the production-design. The digitally-recreated version of 1920's New York looks handsome (if decidedly unreal, in that way that any film which uses too much CGI looks overtly dreamlike), the costumes are spot-on, and the digitally-created 'fantastic beasts' of the title are nicely realized (even if they, too, suffer a bit from the 'unreal' effect imparted by the use of CGI).The problems with this film are many, but the biggest one is that it tries to do too much. It wants to launch a new franchise, so it needs to introduce us to a world full of new wonders (and characters). It wants to satisfy fans of the Potter universe, so it needs to include plenty of special-effects wizardry, plenty of action, and plenty of intrigue. It wants to make a direct appeal to Brits and Americans alike, so we get a Brit transplanted to the USA, and a lot of early-film jokes about the differences between the way Brits and Americans say things. The film also wants to be a bigger spectacle than any individual Harry Potter film -- and so, it's been crammed with enough plot and action for about 5 'normal' movies.All of this has the effect of leaving almost no room for character development, or good dialogue, or good foreshadowing, or any of the mechanics of good storytelling, or anything close to a sense of wonder. Instead, the film proceeds from scene to scene, with threats being explained just as they materialize. The characters deliver nonstop exposition. 'Here is what is happening right now!' they say. 'And here are four new terms you need to know! And here are their definitions!'It's understandable when a film has moments along these lines, especially if it's a film which requires some worldbuilding (as this one clearly does). But 'Fantastic Beasts' is made up of practically nothing but these kinds of moments. It's always introducing us to something new, instructing us about its intricacies, and assuring us that this will all be important later. Rarely does the film slow down enough to present anything like a single satisfying scene.Another problem I had with this film is that, apart from the nice production-design, it's fairly ugly. I mean, good sets, good costumes, and nice creatures only get you so far. These elements have to be filmed and edited effectively in order for the film to have an effective visual aspect.Unfortunately, the cinematography and editing of 'Fantastic Beasts' are competent at best, 'covering' the action without commenting on it or doing anything to enhance the visual aspect of the film. To top that off, the film has been given a desaturated, wintry color-palette of sepia-tones, deep blacks, frosty whites and burnt umbers. The color- scheme might have worked, if the team behind the camera had framed-up some interesting shots and tried to present the action in a cohesive way. But nah, visually, the film has no rhythm or logic or anything, and the murky color-palette only adds to the problem.There are numerous ways in which this material could have been crafted into a better film: Find a better beginning. Dump at least 5 major plot- points from the middle. Spend more time letting the characters get to know each other. Have them talk about stuff that isn't directly related to the plot. Shave a few beats off of the end; the ending here is egregious, it just goes on and on forever and actually gets worse the longer it lingers.Watching 'Fantastic Beasts,' I had hoped to enjoy a good tale. Instead, the experience was more like listening to a kid excitedly list an inventory of his toybox. Hints of a tale emerged, in a disorganized fashion, with little storytelling prowess. But gosh, look at those toys!",3,4,8,17 December 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," The 'Empire Strikes Back' of the MCU
","Finally watched Marvel's 'Avengers: Infinity War' this weekend. Oh, snap!Sorry, Sorry. Terrible joke. Couldn't resist. Anyway, as someone who's not such a big fan of the Marvel films, I found this movie unexpectedly thrilling! My only complaint was that the REMAINING HALF of the Marvel cast didn't ALSO die!No no, but seriously folks, I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would. Infinity War is both a thrilling tragedy and a sublime joke - Marvel trolling their own audience, entertaining Marvel skeptics like me by letting the bad guy win, and killing-off many of their most beloved heroes (even if it's all only for now). The fact that it works, and feels like it has real stakes, even though we all know this is just Part One of a two-part story, is a testament to the skill of the storytellers.In some ways, one might consider Infinity War to be the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Just as 'Empire' is celebrated for being the dramatic pinnacle of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy - the only film in that trilogy to leave our heroes stranded without a plan, at the end of an Act Two crisis without a third act in sight - Infinity War finds its cast of heroes outwitted and outgunned at every turn, their plans failing, their desperation mounting, hope always dangling just out of sight. The promise of good triumphing over evil is always there, until suddenly it isn't.For a tale with such a sprawling cast and such a multi-threaded narrative, Infinity War does a fantastic job of keeping the story clear, even while moving along at a snappy pace. From the very first scene, the narrative zips along faster than might be expected, as we follow Thanos in his quest to possess all six Infinity Stones, and the various groups of heroes who are scrambling to stop him.Part of the thrill, I think, comes from the fact that the heroes are behind from the get-go, only really grasping Thanos' plan after he's secured a couple of the stones -- and even then, we have various groups of heroes flung out across the galaxy, each group knowing some things that the others don't, and each unaware that the other groups are out there. And so it's a thrill, for instance, when the Guardians of the Galaxy encounter Thor, and are startled to find that they're pursuing a common enemy -- and then must find a way to establish trust with one another so that they can work together.The film has a neat trick of having its setups arrive at payoffs much sooner than you expect. In an early scene, as Iron Man and Bruce Banner are meeting Dr. Strange for the first time, and the three are frantically sharing what they know and trying to come up with a plan to defend Earth, suddenly it proves too late for plans as invading ships land outside. It's a neat way of upping the suspense, having our heroes taken by surprise like this. It upends the usual formula, where the heroes have time to strategize before the 'real action' begins. It happens many times during this film; it seems the bad-guys are always arriving exactly when you don't expect them to. It's a great hook.This all creates the illusion that this two-and-a-half hour juggernaut is moving along much faster than it actually is. To be honest, I found myself riveted, thinking that I was just watching the opening scenes -- until I checked the time and found that the film was half over. For as weighty as 'Infinity War' can seem from a distance, given its runtime and its huge cast and its 'tragic' arc, it's remarkably fun and light on its feet.There are also several elements of the story which transcend the superhero genre, in the way that only the best tales of this sort can muster. The fact that Thanos is a compelling villain who truthfully believes himself to be a misunderstood 'good guy' captures the insidious way that evil people often operate in the real world. In Thanos, and in the allegiance he inspires in his followers, we can glimpse the kind of world-leader who commits violent acts in the name of a so-called noble cause, and whose rhetoric soothes the ear of many a constituent.Likewise, it's fascinating how each time the heroes lose a battle, it's ultimately not because of physical weakness or secret vice -- it's because Thanos exploits their love for one another. Time and again, the heroes grudgingly fork-over a stone because they think it's better to let Thanos win this particular battle than to let one (or more) of their friends die. And unfortunately, this puts them into the endgame sooner than they expect, at an impossible disadvantage. It is a virute -- love -- that ultimately proves their undoing!This is all great stuff! So tragic! So ironic! So much fun to watch! This is the stuff of real drama, even if we *are* dealing with a comic-book film, and even if it *is* the first part of a saga which we feel pretty sure will turn out all right in the end. ...In fact, maybe it's *because* we know there's a Part Two coming that makes the tragedy of this installment so thoroughly enjoyable.So anyway, I had a really great time watching Infinity War. As many problems as I've often had with the Marvel approach to filmmaking (and even though I still think their films look weirdly flat and ugly, this one included) -- this film really worked for me. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to watch it again. I knew how it would end before I started it, and it STILL reeled me in. So that's a pretty good film, I think.",9,0,4,15 January 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians 2: Dazzling visuals and a nice soundtrack, but the writers were hardly even trying.
","'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' is a messy, irreverent fever-dream of a comic-book space-opera. Its characters are dumb but as likable as puppy-dogs, its script is about as hokey as a CBS sitcom, its plot is full of holes one could drive a Mack-truck through, its visuals make up for their CGI-fakiness by amping-up the color-saturation into neon-overdrive, and it's all set to an overtly nostalgic 1970's rock soundtrack. How can that be bad? Also, how can that be very good?All of which is to say that I think I liked this sequel better than the original 'Guardians.' It was certainly a bit more fun to look at, containing a few environments -- the 'Sovereign' planet, and the 'Ego' planet -- which were grandly imaginative spectacles of fake- looking and weightless but nonetheless striking CGI work. That, and many of the outer-space battles -- as well as a 'space fireworks' scene at the end -- were as gorgeously colorful as the prettiest sci-fi screensaver. The original 'Guardians' strived for this kind of over-the-top neon-daydream airbrush-art sci-fi book-jacket quality, and it came close. The sequel, however hyperjumps smack dab into the heart of that territory, and pushes the look as far over the top as I'd hoped it might.The film's plot is a little cleaner, a little more satisfying, than the original's. There were so many threads involved in the first film that all I can remember, at this point, is that it had something to do with the Guardians trying to keep something called an Infinity Stone out of the hands of a variety of forgettable villains. Thanos was somehow involved. Was Loki in the film? I can't recall. The entire plot was about chasing or protecting a MacGuffin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin), and the climax -- where somehow the Guardians were able to hold a bare Infinity Stone without dying, after the film had taken pains to inform us that such a feat was impossible -- kind of summed-up all my feelings about the film. Why care at all about a story, when the story is so ready to break from its own established rules and logic for a cheap 'wow' moment?'Guardians 2' provides a feasible-enough explanation for that unlikely climactic moment: Starlord's father is an immortal, god- like being known as a Celestial. This makes Starlord half-immortal, or something. Well, truthfully, it makes Starlord exactly as immortal as the plot needs him to be at any given moment, which is pretty convenient for the plot.This episode of 'Guardians' in fact focuses on the newfound relationship between Starlord (Chris Pratt) and his immortal father, Ego (Kurt Russell). Ego appears out of nowhere in his cosmic egg- ship, just in time to save Starlord and his crew from certain death at the hands of The Sovereign, a race of golden-skinned aristocrats whose ire has been provoked by the Guardians' theft of the very merchandise the Sovereign had hired them to protect. Why steal the very merchandise you've been hired to protect? The only actual reason is because it provides an excuse for some early-film space- battle action. But the film has some fun trying to answer the question of 'Why?' anyway, and eventually lands on the notion that Rocket (the foul-mouthed raccoon) just wants to be loved. That plays every bit as shallow as it sounds, but that's what passes for depth in a film like this.Anyway, after Ego's perfectly-timed rescue, the Guardians' wounded ship crash-lands on a forest-planet. Ego lands alongside, introductions are made, exposition-dumps occur, the next phase of the plot is set-up. Most of the crew then climbs aboard Ego's Eggship for a quick hyperjump over to his home-planet, a fantastical gardenscape known as Ego. Yes, as it turns out, Ego and his home- planet are in fact extensions of the same entity, an incorporeal energy-force which can seemingly manifest itself as anything it desires. This is a neat idea, but this isn't Star Trek, so the most interesting question the film can come up with about Ego's nature is whether or not his human form has a penis?Naturally, Ego's motivations are not as innocent as they first seem, and The Sovereign aren't lost for long. Stir-in a sub-plot involving Yondu, Starlord's 'tough-as-nails but not' adoptive father, and a mutiny aboard his cosmic pirate-ship. Add a measure of cutesy family-comedy in the form of Baby Groot, a CGI film-mascot who's only ever as smart, or as dumb, or as strong, or as weak, as the film needs him to be in any given moment. And there you have the sloppy concoction which comprises 'Guardians 2.'Honestly, this film is fun in an episodic kind of way, and I'm sure that's all it aspires to be. But then, I have to admit that much of the fun was spoiled, for me, by the fact that the film just refuses to respect the logic of its own storytelling. This is one of those films where absolutely anything might happen at any moment, regardless of how ridiculous it might seem, regardless of how out- of-the-blue it might be, regardless of how un-earned the development might seem. Exciting! Things! Happen! But those things are robbed of any weight or meaning by the fact that the film refuses to take its own plot seriously. It's all action with little to no consequence. As soon as you realize that, any kind of suspense or drama is completely gone. At that point, all that's left to do is just drink-in the colorful CGI fireworks and laugh (if you can) at the episodic goofiness.",5,1,3,28 May 2017
Arrival," A smart sci-fi film which couldn't be more relevant or timely:
","As a fan of science-fiction, I'm routinely disappointed in the intelligence and scope of the average sci-fi film. The last few years have been a boon, with intelligent films like 'Moon,' 'Gravity,' 'Her,' 'Ex Machina,' and 'The Martian' receiving wide release. These films use the tools of science-fiction to mine introspective and philosophical themes, to allegorically say something about human nature.And so it is with 'Arrival.' And yet, even though my expectations were set reasonably high by the trailer, I still found myself shocked by just how deeply interesting, powerful and moving this film was. In my mind, this film immediately joined the ranks of such all-time science-fiction film classics as '2001' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'The plot involves Amy Adams as a linguist, and Jeremy Renner as a scientist, both contracted by the military to try to establish meaningful communications with an alien race who have mysteriously appeared, hovering in an egg-like ship, somewhere in the majestic back-country of Montana. The ship is one of 12 which have appeared worldwide -- and so the race is on, as the US and its allies vie to crack the linguistic code before China or Russia. Fears that the aliens might prove malicious hang, omnipresent, over every move.This could certainly be the plot of a fun, lightweight genre piece. But 'Arrival' takes a more considered, more meditative approach. Rather than dispense with its heavy themes lightly, it examines them curiously, finds them more interesting the deeper it looks, builds its entire story around them. This is a film which rewards thought. The pacing of the film, which is very deliberate but not what I'd call slow, might owe something to Andrei Tarkovsky, the famous Russian director 'Stalker' and 'Solaris,' two of the slowest but most hypnotic and profound science-fiction films you're ever likely to see. Come to think of it, many of the sets in 'Arrival,' as well as the camera- placement and lighting, reminded me of Tarkovsky's work.No review of 'Arrival' could be complete without mentioning something about the film's surprising third-act. This is likely to go down in cinematic history as one of the best 'mindblowing' third-acts ever made. I felt a rush comparable to what I felt the moment I first learned the secret of 'The Matrix' -- and yet, here, the 'twist' is so poetic, so natural, so obvious in retrospect, that it really stands alone as a thing of greatness. It's a big thought, presented elegantly. But make no mistake -- the greatness of the ending is well-earned by the film preceding it.I have to say that this movie did a number on me. There's this thing that happens when I see a movie that actually respects my intelligence, where I become moved by even the smallest directorial decisions, because they feel so right. 'Arrival' drew me in almost immediately, with its intimate and ultra-realistic depiction of how Amy Adams' linguist, Dr. Louise Banks, learns of the arrival of the ships. She actually gets the news kind of late. It finds her in the middle of a class she's teaching, as several students' phones start chiming with texts. She's asked by one of her students to turn on the classroom TV. After she does, they all just sit there, stunned, watching the news- footage, not knowing how to react. An alarm goes off, the building is cleared, and everyone is sent home. These scenes play out with crystalline logic; the film observes them closely, without comment or bogus emotional cues. A meditative, nervous score percolates beneath.And here I've described the feeling and the texture of this film, and given you many reasons to see it -- but I haven't even begun to tell you what it's about. Well, doing so would take a lengthy conversation; this film contains some very big ideas.But more than anything else, this is a film about the power of language. A popular scientific theory, discussed by the characters in 'Arrival' but dating back to at least George Orwell's '1984' and its concern with 'NewSpeak,' holds that language actually shapes thought, and not the other way around. Vocabulary and syntax: We're introduced to these concepts before we even know what they are; from our earliest days we're taught the linguistic labels for things, for actions, for emotions and desires -- and we're taught to connect these words in specific ways, in patterns which convey specific meanings. The form of a question differs from the form of a statement. We just learn these things, most of us, and it gives shape to the way we think. Language and thought: Irrevocably intertwined. To what degree is our perception of the world based entirely upon the language we use to describe it and interact with it?That is what 'The Arrival' is about, at its deepest level. It's also about a lot more. It's about a woman coming to terms with grief; it's about a world poised on the brink of war; it's about the fears which divide us; and it's about the bravery -- the trust and the risk -- that it takes to come together again. It's about the miracle of empathy. Arriving hot on the heels of a very polarizing election, when anxieties and animosity are high, this film's messages couldn't be more relevant or timely.",10,8,20,12 November 2016
Wonder Woman," Just a darn good superhero flick.
","I liked 'Wonder Woman' a whole lot. Not only is it a 'fun' movie -- but it's also a 'good' one, with solid writing and character-development to match the larger-than-life heroics.I particularly enjoyed the lengthy prologue, which introduces Diana and her Amazonian family on their home island, a faux-Grecian paradise which is hidden away from the rest of the world behind a kind of supernatural cloaking-device. The film takes its time with these early scenes, revealing the nature of Diana's upbringing and the reasons for her simplistic but naive goodheartedness. These scenes are also beautiful, depicting a paradise that looks remarkably real, without excessive CGI work. I was reminded, in a way, of the old Greek-themed adventure films, such as Hercules, Jason and the Argonauts, and Clash of the Titans. There's an on-location quality to the island scenes in 'Wonder Woman' that does more to establish a sense of reality than even the best CGI can muster.And then the film becomes a WWI espionage adventure, as Diana finds herself drawn into the world of mortals to try and stop a kind of violence she doesn't fully understand. I was entertained by the colorful cast of characters, as well as by the film's charmingly earnest sensibility. This is easily the most downright 'earnest' superhero film since Marvel's original 'Captain America,' and I think it's a better film to boot. Diana's strong-but-naive persona brings out the finer qualities in Steve Trevor, the British spy with whom her life has become entangled, and they have a chemistry that's a lot of fun to watch. Like most superhero films, 'Wonder Woman' had a few too many action- climaxes for my taste, some fairly gaping plot-holes -- (For starters, what happened to that battleship off the coast of the island, which looms ominously before the film totally forgets about it?) -- and the final act is a bit messy. I also thought, for all the talk about the film's Feminist narrative -- well, I'll just say that whatever Feminist narrative it offers is fairly superficial, contained almost entirely in the fact that the film's protagonist is a strong woman who doesn't require a man to save her. But perhaps that's all fine enough. Ultimately, I just wanted a good, fun movie, and 'Wonder Woman' delivered a better time than I had expected. It does a great job of establishing its world and characters, and it tells its story in a satisfying, fun, and emotionally meaningful way. In its best moments, it even achieves a kind of wholesome, humorous, iconic quality that I don't believe we've seen on screen since Richard Donner's original 'Superman.' So yes, I am comparing it unironically to that classic of the genre. One might consider the two films as equals.",8,6,15,11 June 2017
