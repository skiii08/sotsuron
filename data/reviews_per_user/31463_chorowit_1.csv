The Blair Witch Project," Three students die of boredom in the woods. One year later...
","I'm not going to be as phony as other people and say the movie is totally not scary.  Oh it is scary.  For about a combined seven minutes. Interspersed through seventy-eight minutes of boring, repetitive dialog and non-action.  Hey look, I could film a movie of a guy decapitating people for eighty straight minutes.  That would be scary.  But would it be a good movie?  No.  And neither was the Blair Witch Project.  Bottom line is, being lost in the woods at night and having some unknown thing chasing and terrorizing you certainly is scary.  And the filmmakers added the slightest bit of intelligence in the last second of the movie with Mike's placement. However, the rest of the movie is plain old boring and is not worth 5 cents much less the $2 I rented it for.  The whole point of a movie is to have characters you care about, a well-written and thought out storyline and screenplay, and meaningful dialog.  This movie had N O N E!  I don't know why people decided those things weren't important and flocked to see three people walk through the woods for an hour.  In some of the comments below, people said they were hoping the students were killed by the middle of the picture.  I didn't even care enough about them to do that much.",Null,0,1,20 December 1999
