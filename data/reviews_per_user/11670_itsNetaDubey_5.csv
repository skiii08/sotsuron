It," Good !!
","Despite having plenty of gore, It works because it retains a sense of decency. Unlike some of the gratuitous horror films we've seen lately, where women in particular are dispatched in the most disturbing and inhumane ways It does not delve into offensive violence. Give it a try.",8,1,2,6 June 2020
Green Room," Extremely entertaining and brutal.
","Tense horror film that dedicates sufficient time to developing its narrative and not a second more; the descent from naivete into pragmatic ferocity is as compelling as the tightly crafted setting. Stewart is great as the restrained, effective, 'socialized' Nazi, who orchestrates the cruelty rather than partake of it himself. The realism distinguishes this outing from later A24 horror from the likes of Aster, which would incorporate supernatural or psychologically twisted elements almost by default.",8,0,1,6 June 2020

Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages. Plot, storytelling, screenplay, shots, and dialogues need to be deeply studied. A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating 9/10",9,1,3,21 March 2020
