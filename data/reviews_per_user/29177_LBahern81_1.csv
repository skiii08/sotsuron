The Lobster," Just awful
","This is the worst movie I've seen in years. And no, I'm not talking in the realm of Transformers 8 or whatever, but as a film that presents itself as a legitimate story. Annoyingly marketed as one of those 'this movie might not be for everyone, but we think YOU'LL get it, *wink wink', it seems to have been the first draft or a poorly written story that accidentally got the green light. Don't get me wrong, I was totally willing to look past the silliness of being able to turn people who failed to partner up into animals, fine. Except when earlier in the movie they go into some detail of how it is supposedly done, by a team of trained technicians who are masters of their craft. OR Colin Ferrell's character, who has no knowledge of this absurdly complex method, as he drags a woman into an abbandoned lab, because you know, lazy writing. The film has so many more similar inconsistencies, and just as disappointing, the story fails to ever explain why so many of the different factions of people adhere to the principals they now live their life by. 2/10 stars: About the same amount of structure and sense as a speech by Sarah Palin.",2,10,14,5 June 2016
