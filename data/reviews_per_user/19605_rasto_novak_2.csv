The Expendables 2," I was very pleased with the result from Stallone
","First I have to admit, that I was actually satisfied with the prequel as well. Thus, I was looking forward to this one for any circumstances. I have to admire Stallone for casting, very good choices. I was happy once again to see all my childhood good-guys working together in one movie against the bad ones. Norris was a fresh breeze in the middle and honestly I didn't now what to expect. Nevertheless, scenes with him are hilarious (audience in the cinema welcomed it, as well). In my personal opinion, Van Damme showed one of his best acting performances I've ever seen from him. Very good, he should continue with such roles. I liked very much the combination of action and humor, especially some particular 'lines'. thumbs up and absolutely recommend to others and I can't wait for the sequel.",8,0,0,6 December 2012
The Water Diviner," Rubbish, waste of time
",I would suggest to Russel to stick with Ridley Scott as a director. Russel should perform only as an actor otherwise he will end up with his movies on the very bottom. The whole story could be told in 10 minutes. The whole film was too long and boring. Some scenes were so amateur so I thought some high school kids persuaded Crowe to do this 'pieace of art' with them in the back yard. Plot of this story was quite confusing and little bit derisive. Russel goes down or getting old or just getting bored.The only joy from the 90 minutes pain is Olga. She saved some points from my opinion. I'm still not sure if this was a 'based on true story' or somewhat fiction. Because some scenes were quite fetched and hard to believe.,4,5,13,20 May 2015
