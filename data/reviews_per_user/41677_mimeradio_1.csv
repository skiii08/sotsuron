Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not for everybody (only everybody who matters)
","Borat is a SATIRICAL movie about prejudice, and love. While Sacha Baron Cohen pretends to be a journalist from Kazakstan, he interviews dozens of people from all walks of life who all share their 'wisdoms' about America. Some people are turned away from Borat because of it's at times grotesque humor. Sure, Borat is filled with bathroom humor, but that doesn't make it less intelligent. I challenge anyone who watches Borat and does not love it to show me a comedy with more relevant social commentary and funnier scenes. Borat will either have you laughing hysterically, or it will have you with your mouth open in disgust, but either way it will have you. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius.",10,6,11,9 October 2007
