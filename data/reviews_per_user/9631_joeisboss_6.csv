Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Underrated But Still Not Amazing
","Definitely the weakest of the Star Wars films for me. There were so many mediocre parts of it for me that there isn't really that much to say. Some characters were very annoying, the story was good, but not great, and the majority of the characters were just not great. Some scenes stick out to me as very enjoyable though; The PodRacing Scene and The Final Battle/Qui-Gon's death scene in particular. I love Darth Maul, he is very mysterious and has a good presence on screen, making him my favorite character, but Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are a good duo and fun to watch as well. Overall I'd give it a stream, but if you are on a journey to watch all Star Wars movies or need a movie that is decent to watch, I'd say it is a watch it level for me.",7,1,2,17 October 2019
Captain Marvel," A Good Intro to A New Character
","While I think this movie is a bit less than I was expecting, it is still good and has many good aspects to it. Some of the CGI work seems like too much, but the deaging in the film is amazing. The story did indeed have many problems, but I think the twists were handled well and I personally did not see them coming. My favorite part of the movie was something I did not expect though, and that is Talos. Talos is a skrull and is thought to be the villian, but he is actually not. I really enjoyed his character. Of course, this is a Marvel movie, so the action is here and every action scene is well done and very enjoyable. That's about all I have to say about this movie, but I did really like Talos and Nick Fury. While it is in the lower end of Marvel movies and one of my least favorite origin story movies, I still say it is a watch/stream.",7,4,9,17 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Another Great Film In The Franchise
","While this movie doesn't live up to the first 2 installments, it is still a great movie with well done closure to the original trilogy. Much of the movie feels boring to me, but I extremely enjoy the last scenes on Death Star 2 and Endor. These great moments of the film don't make up for the boring aspects of the first part of the movie, but the final battle scenes and Vader/Palpatines deaths make this movie an absolute must watch. I also like the parts at the beginning of the movie as well. I think they are cool and Boba Fett is awesome.",8,0,0,17 October 2019
Pulp Fiction," Best Ever
","This is easily my favorite movie. It has so much packed into it, so many twists and turns, and everything seems real, even the obscure things. It is hard to review this movie since there isn't anything bad to say about it. All I can say is watch it. I don't think you will be disappointed unless you're not into this kind of movie.
SPOILERS BELOWAnd Vincent Vegas death still has me shocked 3 days after the first watch. I fricking flipped when that happened.",10,0,1,22 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Great Film, One of The Best Star Wars Movies
","I think this movie is severely underrated. While the story has some bad bumps, we can all agree this has the best fight scenes in the Skywalker Saga and has the be at lightsaber battle scene in all of Star Wars. Every scene in the movie is enjoyable, from Order 66, to the Mustafar Showdown, and even some of the filler scenes. Sure Padme's death was a little lame and forced (no pun intended lol) but it was nice to get an intro to our characters of the original trilogy. I say the movie was very good and is one of the first Star Wars movies I grab at when I want to watch one. I say it is a must-watch mainly for the amazing action sequences.",9,0,0,17 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An Absolute Classic That Aged Beautifully
","An epic movie about good vs evil. Many can agree with me in saying this is the most recognizable and one of the be movies of the action/adventure genre. The way the story flows and is put together is astounding. While some of the special effects of the original can't stand up to modern era films, it is great that they rereleased the films with updated effects. The movie is also filmed very well. The characters in the movie were set up great too. Their stories all went well with one another, and many of the scenes in this movie are amazing. I specifically like Obi Wans Death Scene, and the Death Star Battle and Destruction. Can't wait for Episode 9 and am anticipating a great film.",9,1,1,17 October 2019
