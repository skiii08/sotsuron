Despicable Me 2," Awesome Movie
","Despicable Me 2 is a great film. We like to watch it a lot. The characters in the film are lovely and kind. For example Gru, he is an evil man but he is also a good dad. He always love and take care of his daughters. We also love the minions. Because they are so cute and adorable. They sing so funny and great. We love all of their songs at Gru's wedding. They sing I Swear but they read Underwear. It made us laugh over and over. We love the 3 daughters of Gru. They always care about their dad. That makes us love them a lot. In conclusion, we think the film is fantastic and want to watch it over and over again. We definitely recommend this movie to everybody. Everyone must watch this movie at least 5 times.ILA S3A Class: Milly Daisy Van Kate Erika",9,0,0,22 February 2014
