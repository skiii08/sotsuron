E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Perfection
","This was the first film I ever saw at the cinema. My dad took me to see it when I was only 6/7 so it has always held its own in my top 5 films.Its just a great family flick that you can't help but just get involved with ! The acting is cracking - especially from Henry Thomas as Elliot and basically I just can't praise this film enough.Now I have said this for the past 3 or 4 years to my mates who all thought I was a saddo poof. However, a big group of us went to see it last night in its new 'improved' format and by the end there wasn't a dry eye in the place !Of course its going to have it's cynics - but what do they know ?Go and watch it now - at the cinema ! You won't regret it !",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
