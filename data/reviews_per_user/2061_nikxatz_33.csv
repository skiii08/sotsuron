Blade Runner 2049," Time to live
","Blade Runner 2049 is one of the best sequels of all time.Visually captivating and full of deep philosophical questions about the importance of human existence,it is a spectacle that nobody should miss.The universe is created really well and includes new ideas and machines beyond our imagination.That makes the film more intriguing and original.The performances were really good,especially Sylvia Hoeks and Harrison Ford,and Ryan Gosling's character was deep and well- developed.The directing by Denis Villeneuve is breath-taking and proves that there are still directors that can make movies the are close to becoming masterpieces.The tone is the same,the visuals couldn't have been better and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is a total blast.But,most of all,Blade Runner tries (and achieves) to answer not only what makes us human but also what makes us feel,love,remember and understand what is real and what is not.It'a film not only with a mind.It has a heart(if we can define what has a heart and what doesn't).When you live the cinema you want to keep all these beautiful images,these mixed and complicated feelings and the spectacular experience inside you.Sadly,all those moments will be lost in time,like tears in rain.Too bad they won't live,but then again who does?",10,2,9,7 October 2017
Requiem for a Dream," when Dreams turn into Dust...
","'Requiem for a Dream' is one of the most immersive and shocking films of all time and in the end the movie turns into a feeling, an emotion- of unescapable sadness. One can say that it works as a complete drugs-do-bad movie, but the film is far more than that. It is a sad and tragic story of lost dreams and self destruction.At first, the way this is filmed adds so much to the experience. We get sthe same close-ups and fast transitions (it's like Edgar Wright was in the edit room) everytime the characters consume their 'thing'.We also get some split-screne sequences and uring the climax the film enters deeper and deeper into the human mind and a couple of sureal sequences are shown.
All these make for an immersive and 'ugly' experience that is ment to be desturbing. The only stilistic choice that I found too much was the some split screen moments whixh i think do not add a lot to the experience.But afar from the tremendous filming endavour...this film tells so much about the human condition and the black holes that a peron can fall into. In the film, all of the four 'vicitms' want sometihng, have a strong desire and they all fall in the same pitfall in order to complete their want.
A lonely widow who wants to be 'someone' and gai happyness by being loved and famousHer son who wants to find a money, make some money and have a girl
His girl who loves modeling and clothes and wants to make her own shop
And the man's firend who believes that by being succesful at a field he will make his mother happy and proud.All these dreams are shattered by their addiction to drugs. They lose their mind, their sanity, their love, their life.And it all eels so tragic and nightmarish.I mostly loved the more sutle scenes , like the conversation between mom and son about their situation. But the sureal sequences during the climax where pretty affecting too.Also, I really do not thing that this film is only about drugs, but cna be seen as a showcase of the consequences of our obsesions and addictions in general. And even the film is centered around drugs, we notice other addictions and obsesions too. Being mad for sex, for money, fame, recognition, love and acceptance, mad for food or for a calm life without worries are all addictions presented in the film and are all dangerous. The film shows that the only one that can destroy us really is our own self and our inability to control our desires which gradually become more and more monsterous.The characters are nicely written, they feel like real people,tohugh i think the young femal character was kind of underdeveloped and lacked a second layer. The performances are all exceptional, somobody give the actress playing theold womn another slice of grapefruit because she truly deserves it!The score is haunting and I liked that the movie used it corretly.You have to see this film and i might wreck you o pieces or make you rethink your small, unimportant existance but in the end eveything will be ok.Just kidding. No one can save youo of your doom except of you.",9,0,0,18 July 2019
Fight Club," A fight club full of life lessons!
","When somebody sees the title 'Fight Club'' for a movie the only things that he will think is blood,fights and violence.But,Fight club is exactly the opposite.It's different way to feel free and forget pressure,your job or whatever makes you feel bad. Fght club is not bad,just too different and crazy to understand it's definition.I that I've seen the movie,would characterize this club as a guy,as ...Tyler, the crazy and cool person that tries to build a new world through this club.A new beginning,a new way to express ourselves and understand the value of life.This is the Fight Club,this is Tyler.The film is a masterpiece and the tremendous acting of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton turn it into one of the best films of all time.But,I think i've said enough.For those who haven't watched the film,stop reading my review,put on your shoes and run fast to rent it.And you better take a bar of soap with you.It will be useful!",10,1,4,31 August 2016
Memento," Nolan did it again!
","Memento is something new,something different,a masterpiece among movies!When the movie started I had not really high expectations about it!But, while the movie was going on I couldn't take my eyes out of the screen!I felt like i was Leopard,the protagonist!Moreover,the movie is really cool and different because there are a lot of fast,amazing scene changes and the movie is full of flashbacks!For instance,in one scene Leonard is in the bath and in the next,we watch him going to the bath!!!I've watched some of the movies of Nolan(Batman:the dark knight,Interstellar) and a lot of enthusiastic films(Forest Gump,3 Idiots,Star wars,One flew over the cuckoo's nest) and,trust me,this is one of the most clever films that i have ever watched!Maybe it's a difficult film with a complex plot,but it is worth it! Tremendous scenes,crazy plot and a wonderful ending!Memento... an amazing memory!",10,0,2,1 August 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A rogue film
","Star wars...after the tremendous success of 'The Force Awakens', Lucasfilm and director Gareth Edwards decided to produce the first Star wars film that does not follow the storyline of the movies,but explains how the rebels stole the Death Star plans.I am and I will always be a huge fan of the movies and,as a true fan,I consider Rogue One a must-see and not just a typical Science fiction story.One reason that Rogue One is an awesome film is...the one and only...lord of the Sith...the chosen one(although I believe that Kylo Ren is the chosen one)...Darth Vader!!!!!!!!After thirteen years the big guy is shown on the screen and he is just perfect.Vader plays in the film just for three minute,but his presence is unforgettable.I(and all the other guys that are crazy about the star wars universe)hope that he will be also shown in The Han solo anthology film!But not only Vader kept the audience on the edge of their seat!K-2SO,the opposite of C- 3PO,was a really cool and entertaining character.Moreover,Chirrut was a great character with really cool fighting skills but also he was a strong believer of the Force.Rogue One was clearly a star wars film with much war,but it also included some great drama scenes and some small twists!The action scenes were perfect and the performances of Felicity Jones and Diego Luna were satisfying.The music was fantastic,as always,and in my opinion,the movie inspired me and thought me that in order to rebel,we must have hope.Rebellions are built on hope!The 3rd act...just perfect.Fight scenes,sudden deaths,Vader's lightsaber and of course..the extremely wonderful ending scene!The movie could last twenty minutes more and how more of Vader's perfection,but that wasn't a huge flaw.All in all,Rogue One is a film that everyone and only Star Wars fans ought to watch.You should go and watch it with your eyes open and don't just go to the cinema and fall asleep from the half of the film,like my mum! did!!It's a must-see,because of Vader,the plot,the action-scenes but basically because it's a clear,fresh,cool,inspiring,awesome Star wars film with the quality of the originals(4,5,6).For once more,may the Force be with you!",8,2,6,22 December 2016
Us," Us and...
","...Them. The rich and the poor. The wealhy and the impoverished. The ones and the others. The people and the puppets. The living and their shadows.Us is the second movie directed by the highly-respected Jordan Peele, who made 'Get Out' 2 years ago. This horror film manages to do so many things in its limited runtime. It succeeds at being a fun, scary an entertaining ride without losing its social and political themes.The film talks about disciminations and class diferences in a fresh and exciting way and proves that such social problems are still present. We have our luxurious houses, our well-cooked meals, our comfortable lifestyles and because of our easiness we tend to forget about 'Them', the ones who suffer, who are in pain or the ones who help and try but never get a reward. 'Us' is parltly about all these intriguing themes, but never forgets that it is also a film and a dark and fun experirience and not just a politically driven story.Its nicely shot, some of the shots actually ahve hidden meanings and clues or the development of the story. The acting is spot on, with Lupita playing 2 really demanding roles giving her most shocking performance yet. The soundtrack is great and some of the songs are used a contrast to the events of the film and make for a good laugh. The movie has its humor too, but sometimes I felt that it was too much with it.The script is really one of a kind. It might not be 100% original, but it is presented in such a way that the point it tries to make are clear while being such a good cinematic experience. It is of a bigger scale and has a lot of plot points that are clever.Now, the bads. Firstly, like most films of its genre, it has a banch of forced moments and some characters take really stupid decisions. Sometimes, during the 2nd act, it loses its weight as a story and has a lot of ups and downs in its tone. One joke comes after the other and I kind of forgot that I was watching a horror film. And the twist in the end is sooooooooooooooooo predictable and I'm still not sure if it is really important. They could have just go for something more ambiguous or give a hint or something.But, overall that's a good horror-social commentary-comedy! Jordan Peele makes his own kind of movies and tries to explore and talk about global and 'US ' issues in startling, new ways. Even if I'm not sure if 'Us' and 'Get Out' belong in the same universe, they are great and significant films and deserve your attention!8/10 Watch in the cinemas with your shadow and have some scissors with you...",7,17,34,24 March 2019
Juno," 'Juno' has a baby and a heart for sure
","'Juno' is a 2007 indie film and it is about a 16-old-girl who has sex and gets pregnant. It is a good film and a great, emotional experience, with a good understanding of its characters and some rapid and funny dialogue.
Ellen Page is magnificent. She is badass, cool, relatable and nails the role.Her character was so fun to watch. Michael Cera was also great and quircky.
This film is quircky, risky and kind of touching and really easy-going at the same time.The script is good, though not perfect. The dialogue is clever and funny. There are a lot of funny references and details too. It just that two characters in the film were really weird. I am talking for the dudes who want to adopt the child. Almost every scene with them felt kind of weird, creepy and overall did not feet the tone. It might was bad writing or even some inconsistencies in the acting, but these scenes were my least favourite partof the film.The soundtrack is fine. It is ne of those soundtracks with a banch of unknown, slow, sweet song that fit the movie but feel all the same and I would have prefered if there was not a song in every single scene!Anyways, this film is definately not perfect, but it has a lot of good things and its lesson about self-discovery, relationships and love is nice and sweet. It is a touching, funny, rational and funky little film that feels kin of it's own messed-up thing. It's like an older version of Lady Bird or a sequel to 'The Perks of being a Wallflower'.It got me

Pan's Labyrinth," A dark and deep fantasy film,visible only to those who know where to look.
","Pan's labyrinth is surely one of the best fantasy films of time because it is a fantasy film full symbolisms and life lessons about pain,love and mostly about humans and their behavior.The movie has an eye-catching plot,combining fantastic elements with war and a lot of drama,some well developed and enjoyable characters like Pan,great music and of course a satisfying ending that makes the film far far greater,showing that we should sacrifice for our love ones and generally for others and our sacrifice will make us happier.This magical movie also shows the cruelty of human beings and shows that war makes people miserable and does not allow them to dream and hope.Pan's Labyrinth has a really dark tone as a film,which makes the movie more interesting and fascinating.It isn't like other fantasy films that show only the good side of life,but gives emphasis to the dark times that people phased during that times.The ending is so good because its tragic and happy at the same time!The director created a labyrinth that none of us would want to leave.A dark,deep and surely a film that is hard to forget.",9,1,1,19 March 2017
Suicide Squad," I was the 'the lucky one'...
","'Spoiler Alert'I went to the cinema and sat to the first line,so that I can get all the craziness of the film.Although it was funny and pretty interesting as a film,it had several mistakes.1st.'Where is Joker?'' Before I watch the film,I had known that joker played just 15 minutes and that made me a little bit disappointed.In my opinion,if Joker had a bigger role in the film,the movie would be amazing.2nd.'Let's put the monsters aside!' When a movie full of action and comedy has a huge demon and a strange witch for the bad guys,it creates a mess,that we can clearly observe in the last quarter of the film.The monsters weren't something the impressive,although that the fight scenes that were made between the squad and them were pretty entertaining.3rd.'When did Batman became just a bat?' One the worst characters in the film was Batman.He didn't do anything,except of looking like a bat.However,the film remains great do to its fast,funny scenes and jokes,the excellent acting of Will Smith's and Margot Robbie's as the amazing protagonist...Harley Queen!Also,Captain Boomerang was hilarious,so i liked him as a character.The guy with the flames was fantastic until the point which he became a stupid master with flames and...About Killer crock...he wasn't anything that could blow up our minds! Finally, maybe the film wasn't like The Dark Knight,but it is still a fresh,funny and absolutely crazy dc film!Ha...ha...ha!",4,1,3,4 September 2016
Full Metal Jacket," Something about the duality of man
","Kubrick strikes again with a great, fun and genius film about this wild and nightmarish thing called war. Just like with some of his previous films like Paths of Glory or even A Clockwork Orange, Kubrick is not a director that gives a focus on facts but instead empasizes on the effect on human nature. In Full Metal Jacket, we carefully see how war targets at gradually dehumanizing every bit out of a human being. We want killers!
The first act is a clear example of that, with a private being the tragic victim of the sickness of war. I have to admit I loved the first act, because it is fun and funny but at th same time it rips my heart and challenged my mind. The characters are brilliant to watch, the humour is so spot-on and there is so much meaning behind everything. The introducton scene is probably my favourite Kubrick intro ever. The clever use of the song, the symbolism behind the idea of it, the first look to our characters who lose a part of themsleves even rom the first scene.
Now, the second act might be really slow-paced and kind of all over the place, but it is as meaningful as the first act. Our main character, Joker, though being a soldier, has maintained his morality and personality, he is not cold and still has not become a complete war machine, thuswe have the perfectly placed and written 'something about the duality of man' scene. He has a heart, he cares for life. And then we see him fail to keep going like that, he has to comromise to the brutality of war and beocme a killer, a man born to kill, a war weapon and completely lose his individuality and character traits and morals.
The second act might be hard to follow, because of the lack of fast-pacing and humour, but it really takes the story to a meaningful finale and we are lead to a realisation about the cruelty of war and how it forcefully transfers a human into a war ultra killing machine. Just take a look at the first and last scene and you can see the transformation
Perect camera move, even greater cenmatography, realistic sets and the soundtrack is a blast.
One of the most meanigful and important war films ever.",9,1,2,9 August 2019
Baby Driver," B-a-b-y
","Baby...Oh Baby...Baby Driver is one of the coolest,smartest and greatest films I've seen in years.It's fast-paced, well-acted,with beautiful cinematography and an outstanding soundtrack.Ansel Elgort's performance is great and all the other actors like Kevin Spacey,Jammie Fox and John Hamn were satisfying. The movie is also one of the best choreographed films I've ever seen.Every single move of the characters is combined with music and after a point I understood that without the music,this heist movie wouldn't work.An example of perfect connection of the music with the scenes is when Baddie,Darling and Bats shoot at some people and all this shooting coming form their guns creates..music. Edgar Wright's direction was phenomenal because, in my opinion, he found a perfect balance of style and substance.The car chase scenes,especially the first one,are perfectly directed and show that without a doubt Edgar Wright is one of the best director's working today. All in all,Baby Driver is a fun,cool and ambitious ride with lots of twists and turns and a perfect combination of what we love most: Cars and Music After Baby Driver my mind is only thinking of one thing Just me,music and the road",9,67,112,27 August 2017
The Shining," The Shining 'shines' for sure
","I watched this film with a cousin and a friend during a rather cold summer night. The circumstances might not have been the best, but I have to saw that I really enjoyed this film really much and it is for sure a really effecting and important horror film with one of the best performances ever by Jack Nickolson.
The film starts of and the pacing is patient and slow, but clues tha something big will pop out are visible. We are introduced to a looking-friendly writer,
his caring and quite naive wife and their young child that has an imaginary friend and faces some phycological problems.
They will have to take care of the grand Overlook Hotel for some months, isolated in these huge place. It does nt take a while till madness visits them.
I love the first sequence when they are introduced to each room of the hotel, we can imagine of the horrible things that might take place to those rooms and we are also introduced, just like our characters, to the main location to which the story takes place.
Then the whole film is a gradual turn to madness and hell...
The shot composition is perfect just like every other Kubrick film. The long takes when characters walk in the halls, the scenes with the kid riding the bike, the way the camera pulls back to reveal the mother and son watching tv in a snowy landscape,the room 237 sequence, the labyrinth parts, the classic elevator scene... Kubrick manages to be at his best during at most of these sequences.
The use of the pre-exisitng music is magnificent. Probably my favourite use of music in a horror film.
Everything that has to do with Jack Nickolson in this film.... my lord! His performance is maybe the best perormance in a film ever....? No words really. He completely transforms into this insane character and adds so much to this experience. Also, the lines written for his characters are just perect too. I love it when he gets completely mad and also when the movie leaves hints of what might happe inside the dialogues and lines of the characters.
Now, I might have some things that did not 'shine' so much in this film, but that might be because of my expectations or of a misunderstanding. So, the film introduces is us to a lot of 'paranoic aspects' and ghosts and really has a gripping history. The matter is tohugh, that it does not take this paranoia to the extreme level of horror or illness that I would want to. It does not explode so much that I felt sick or really really bas at the end. Yes, Jack Nckolson is in every posible way horrifying to watch, but afar from that the film is not much of an 'exploding nightmare' at many terms. Sure, it has a consistency in its characters and story... it just...did not ruin me the way I would want it too.
As an experience, I have to say I enjoyed and felt great of how awosome the film looked and how well Jack perfrormed in this film-he is just explosive. My one and only real issue is a wanted to be as hauting as 'A clockwork orange' was, without saying that it does work the way it is.
It shines, but without blinding me.Kubrick is a genius, anyways",8,0,0,6 August 2019
Being John Malkovich," Being Charlie Kaufman
","'Being John Malcovitch' is, in summary, a film about love, minds and puppets. Charlie Kaufman has proven once again, and this time mor than ever, that in order for a script to work it has to be an honest one, a script written by a person and a piece of art that illustrates that person's thoughts and emotions. I am amazed by the fact that with every movie he makes he shows a side of himself, a piece of his heart. His films are him and he is his films. As for this work...
It is a detailed, raw and (in a good way) dizzing illustration of what it means to 'be', to exist, to be trapped in a body, your body, to want, to need, to ache, to crave for something and because of your misery to get it you become another to be pleased... BOOM! I mean every singe moment I think about his films a new thing pops up!
So, now I am going to tell you my view on this film. Anyone who just wans a brief review, you can skip the next paragraph and head to the others.
As I see it, the film revolves around the idea of puppets. Yes, puppets. It sounds rediculous right? Well. a puupet can mean a lot. When we handle a puupet, we become another,we live another life, we control our a life and seize it the way we want to. We feel grand and free. Being another gives us joy because another means another life with new an interesting things to live. We are bored of our failure and sadness and we all seek that 'other'. How many times have you imagined how life would be if you had more money or a better house or a more pretty face or fame? How many times have played theater alone and rehearse what you are going to say to sb or your future life? How often have your expectations of a 'happy ending' to your day proved you wrong? And puupets mean even more. Everyone can be a puppet. A person can control a person and at the same time be controlled by another person and it goes on forever. We are never really free, are we? EVEN in the film industry. The cast is the puppets, the director pulls the stings and he might be controlled by the writer or the production company and it goes on...
So, in short I loved this film because this film IS its creator. It is his view, his idea on love, pain, relationships, desires, lonelyness. 'Being John Malkovich' never feels like a selling product or a popcorny blockbuser made to make money and make people laugh. We get to grasp our inescapable lonelyness and the fact that we are all the same, suffering being that is born , lives a huge part of life in despair and constant sadness and dies. Its attention to detail, from the maticulusly crafted puppets to the short hillarious documentaries, its authentic performances (Malcovitch is shining in this one) and its HONEST direction and writing make this film a gem and an insight to the great Charlie Kaufman. If only I could be in his mind...WAIT A MIN-",9,0,0,25 May 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An anthem to a marvellous universe
","Well, I am impressed and honoured to be part of this family. This people getting together to watch and live the epic climax of such a vast and heroic universe. Beacause this film is all about this. About a huge family getting together to fight and save the world. It is not a movie. It is not just a movie. It is in a way a phenomenon, which moves every fan and fills their hearts-our hearts- with enthuisasm, joy and a sense of pride to be a member of this extermely big event.The film as a film is also one of great value. The conversations between the characters are funny and well-written, the big stars get a nice amount of character developement, most of the plot points feel natural and logical to happen and the final battle is jaw-dropping. The audience experieneces a variey of emotions till the last act- where pathos and amazement are the majror emotions. Great characters, awosome moments, a satisfying fan service and a mixture of emotions.And although I am not a big fan of MARVEL or superhero films, I actually have to admit that this 'event' was something huge and important for cinema. And yes, 'artists' will avoid it and some will find it silly and childish, but I can assure you that this film has a heart and it is like a big, colourful, noisy parade.Ok, it has its flaws. The first quarter feels 'off', some of the humour and of the references are too much there is a feministic scene alsmost every Marvel superhero woman is there and it feels cheasy, a little bit of shaky camera, but...We have characters, epicness, long-shots, a solid soundtrack and a great amount of emotions. And we also learn that whatever happens, good or bad, we will fight it... together.What a day.8/10 go experience it with lots of friends and in front of a big screen",7,1,4,24 April 2019
Climax," A Haunting Ball
","I watched Climax without knowing any plot detail or having watched and footage that had to do with the film.But, even if I had watched them, I assure you that nothing can prepare you for what you will expercience while watching this film- Climax is a truly immersive and intoxicating ride that cannot be described or compared to anything else.
 Gaspar Noe plays with your mind and your emotions in every way possible. The nightmarish cineatography, the unsetting colours apperaing in the screen, the horryfiyng soundtrack ( Supernature is spectacular!), the the non-stop movement of the camera and the incredible work by the cast- which mainly consists of kids between 18 to 23 years old who only do sorts of krump dance-offs or voguing balls mash up in a 1 and a half hour film which is as electrifiyng as hell. 
I really admire such films, that are able to make you part of their universe, even if it is totally odd and ablnormal, and force you to feel one of with the situation, thus creating a completely genuine cinematic expericence.
 I also love the filrst dance scene, which is actually a single shot and you can actually see the amount of effort that the actors put to take you by the hand and pull you in their own world filled with fleeting plesures. And this is what CLIMAX really is.
 It's horrifying but beautiful, sick but true, dark but colourful, dead but alive.
It's nothing BUT everything.
Now, let's dance",9,46,102,15 October 2018
The Favourite," Rabbitholes
","Here it is. The Favourite is probably Yorgos Lanthimos most well-crafted film yet.Firstly, the 3 actresses were a blast to watch. Olivia Colman does an outsanding job and her performance really makes you understand her character. Rachel Weisz is tough, stiff, cold but caring. Emma Stone is a delight to watch once again. She is cunning like a fox (or should I say a rabbit), passionate , sexy and adds a lot to the movie.The films looks exceptionally well. The natural lighting, the complex editing, the overall production and the costumes create a a mesmerizing feel and really put you at that time period. As for the fish-eye shots, I kind of liked them. They look incredible when movement is present, but some of them feel a little out of place. But, I like that he is actually trying new things.The soundtrack... just perfect. It is intense and fits to the film dark, worrying tone.Well, what about its story?
The Favourite is one the best screenplays ever written. The dialogues are sharp, the way in which the story is developed is so clever and the events that take place are so well thought. Its disturbing tone is apparent , but not as much as in his other films. Oh, and its lots of fun. Hilarious.Its themes are also interestingly developed. It is open to interpretation like his other films and if I made something out of it it would be that power and fame don't give room for love and care. The queen is form the very start of the film weak and lonely, desperately searching for somebody to truly understand her pain. She lives in her palace with her 'everythings', but is in lack of connection and sensitivity towards her. Rachel's character cares for her and loves her but the queen does not want that kind of love. And when Emma Stone's character pops out, the queen finds pleasure and love in a lie, a fake love. What is it better, to feel nice even if you know its all a lie or to always feel empty, but having to face the tragic truth? For me, its the second one, but you can make something different out of it.
Also, the rabbits play a huge role and are a key factor to understanding the film.Overall, The Favourite is one of my favourites. I am Greek and I profound moved that a Greek director has made such excellent films. The Favourite is a haunting, dazzling labyrinth, a dark rabbithole in which you'll keep falling and falling... till you fall in mud.
And you know, mud stinks.Great

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," As real as a donut
","Whenever I go to watch a Tarantino film, I know that something huge is coming. He is one of those filmmakers that made me love cinema and understand its value and force. I remember the first time I watched 'Kill Bill'. I was home sick, sitting in the coutch and I thought: 'Well, if the medicines can't make me fine, something has to!'. And eventually he did. 'Kill Bill' fixed my mood and made me revalue art. It was creative, took risks and it was lots of fun. And now, Quentin makes his 9th film and boy, oh boy, isn't it a blast.'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' is one of Quentin's mosot intellligent, detailed and fun films to watch and also serves as insant love letter to film and to this crazy world called Hollwood, Let's dig into it.Firstly, the world. Right form the first 15 minutes of the film it is visible that Quentin has given life to the 69' Hollywood era. Everything feels so real and the whole film looks like it is set that exact time, even if I never lived there to see what it is liked. The funky streets, the pop-up graphittis, the clothing, the cafeterias and cinemas, the shiny billboards, the 69' cars and lastly the car radios that play constantly during the film and ads are included. Quentin used all of the tracks included in an old radio station 'Boss Radio' and he actually remembers that during that time people would not switch from one radio station to the other, but keep it there for their whole drive, even if they disliked a song or the adverstisments started playing. That's a nice touch.
Also, Quentin created made-up films for the film and also reshot of these films with new actors. His team crafted posters, mugs and turned a whole street into 69' Hollywood. Now that demands your attention.OF course, there is no Tarantino film without Tarantino characters in it. And he manages to birng out one of the most dinamic and fun to watch duos in cinema history. We got famous actor Rick Dalton, known for his presense in westerns and other films and his stuntman Cliff Booth, who, as they both agree to, has the job of carrying his load. Rick is at the ends of his career, he has been playing the bad guy in TV series pilots for the past years and his good, shiny days are gone. He feels like a nobody and in his face we see a faiding star who desperately tries to shine again. Cliff, on the other hand, is more calm and controlled. He just finds driving Rick to his jobs and bein his buddy fun and does not really care that his career is ending. Their story takes place during the infamous Hollywood scandal of the Sharon Tate murders ( 9 of August, 1969) . We also get to see the life of Tate before these events, as she enjoys the goods and luxurys of being a pretty actress in the Hollywood world.As I see it, the whole film is centered around the friendly bond of Rick and Cliff, even if the story drags them to different paths. Their friendship is what gives soul to the film. Rick keeps trying to be a star again and Cliff is there to remind his that he is Rick-f-word-Dalton. In the two fo them we see a duality of man. We have the worrying actor who fears of his finishing career and the relaxed stuntman who has accepeted his situation and just keeps living. Put these two together and there you have it.The cast is tremendous. Margot nails non-verbal acting, escpecially at the cinema scene with her really authentic reactions, Leo is has not been more mad and Brat is just... priceless. His performance along with Cliff's easy-going personality and violent-nature all come together and create what might be one of Quentin's most memorable characters. Pacino has a nice role too and Curt Russel hating a stuntman is alreary a hit. Oh, and the Bruce Lee scene is the most funny scene I've seen in a while and those who claim that it is mean to portray him like that are just dump people with no sense of humour.Now, let's talk about the story's stucture because a lot of people call this film boring and claim that nothing is going on, but the poor ones just don't get it.
To beign with, there is a difference between slow-paced and boring. Yes, the movie has a slow pace, but it is not boring at all. To me, it's all about the characters and the world they live in. We get the chance to see and feel what Hollywood felt like during 69' and we actually get to see the life of two really ineresting personalities portrayed by brilliant actors. Yes, the film does not have a certain goal or a narrative whch goes from one point to the other, like Django or Reservoir Dogs. It is more of a collection of moments that come togeher and create such a fun watch. We get western scenes, hippie scenes, a lot of driving scenes... how isn't this fun? I can't say that I got bored in the film at any means.Maybe the Sharon Tate parts felt kind of less interesting compared to the other two stories, especially the first itme I watched the film, and at some points the film goes at weird directions, but it is all about the characters the portayal of the industry.Okay, the soundtrack is just pure gold. 'Hush', 'Treat Her Right', 'Son of a Loving Man', 'California Dreamin'', 'Out of Time', Bring a Little Lovin''... one of Tarantino's best tracks and it makes the film much more energetic and atmospheric.The ending is really, really clever and it feels like a huge hug of consolation to Tate and to Hollywood's history from the one and only, Quentin Tarantino. By the end, I just wanted more and more...'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' is a cinematic joy. It is powerful, stylish, funny, comfy, clever, atmospheric, melancholic, beautiful and I feel that one day it will be considered of those film's that told history in the most fun and sweet of ways.See you in the next one, Quentie.",9,13,28,27 August 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Flying Colors!
","'Sensual Italian Summer' was what actor Armie Hammer said when they asked him to describe this film with three words.He is actually right,but I have to admit that this film was much more.
The acclaimed director Luca Guadagnino has crafted a lovely,true and truly heartbreaking film.His use of bright colors,tranquil music and elegant camera work create a unique and rather immersive experience.Though the beautiful images,the great soundtrack by a masterful artist,Sufjan Stevens we travel in Italy in the year 1983 and view one of the most romantic stories ever made.We are allowed to feel the splashing waters,the delicious food,explore the italian culture and experience a monumental work of art.
The chemistry between the leading actors is sensational.It is one of the rare experiences in which one actor cannot stand in front of the camera without the other.The perfect performances by Armie Hammer and the talented Timothy Chamalet bring the movie to another level and so does the transpiring music.
As for its themes,Call Me by your Name depicts in an atmospheric way the first feelings of love,desire,seduction that a 17 year old boy experiences.
The film,instead of explaining to us what love is,it let us feel love,sadness,compassion and wonder about its mystery.
The film couldn't have ended better. Elio (Oliver,to be correct) is questioning his feelings and remembers the beautiful,emotional,essential summer that passed...
But the thing that really got my attention in the last scene was the flies that where sitting on Elios elbow.These flies are reminiscent of this summer,this dream-like memories that are hard to forget...
Don't watch this film.Feel it.",9,2,5,11 February 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Luke didn't know what to say after watching this movie!
","Impressive,most impressive.After 37 years(The Empire Strikes Back) Star Wars is back.Star Wars:The Last Jedi is a nearly perfect film full of jaw-dropping action scenes,stunning visuals and huge twists and turns.
 The film is awesomely directed by Rian Johnson,who achieves to depict his own vision of this beloved universe.The action scenes never miss a bit due to his directing.The film's plot is really effective. lot of things happen that even the hugest Star Wars fan couldn't think of.This movie expands the Star Wars universe and adds new ideas to it in an original, fascinating way.The risky direction that the film takes make it a pure delight.
 The performances were really good.Mark Hamill was better than ever,Adam Driver was excellent and generally the whole cast did a great job.The relasinonship between Ray and Kylo is well-developed and although some people
found Fin's and Rose's adventure boring or insignificant,but I found it fine.
 The third act of the film one of the best moments in Star Wars history.Character's collide,the screen bursts with breath-taking scenes and a lot of questions are answered.
 The only flaw was the humor.Despite the fact that I laughed a lot,I have to admit that a lot of the jokes were presented in a way that looked like the film was making fun of itself.But this,in my opinion,is a flaw of minimum importance.
 All in all, Star Wars :The Last Jedi is amazing.It's a film to remember.A film which proves that Star Wars is and will always be a part of our history.But,even if it was bad or a failure,It wouldn't worry me at all.Because,as an old master once said:'Failure the greatest lesson is'.",8,0,11,15 December 2017
Midsommar," It's tough to forget this one
","Well, summer never looked weirder.Midsommar is the new nightmar by Ari Aster, who did a solid job with Hereditary. To me, Hereditary nver felt really scary or deeply disturbing, but it was definately entertaining and worked really smoothly as a family drama with Toni Collette giving a powerhouse performance. Midsommar, is a different film in a lot of ways. One thing is sure, though. I 'll never go to Sweden during the summer.
So, the film basically is about a group of friends visiting this society who live by their own rules and who are currently having this big event. In the group there is a girl who, after a tragedy, lives in pain and her boyfriend is trying to make her feel better.
The best way to describe this film is that in the end it is more of a feeling, it stands as an emotion and a disturbing one indeed. The main reason I wated to watch the film except of Ari and A24 was its undiniably visual presention. It looks so colourful and beautiful. The sun, the trees, the flowers, all feel so immersive and tranquil and cinemaography geeks are going to love this one. Noth only the actual sets and locations are blessed with joy and colour, but the camera movement, the way Ari draws the camera to reveal more information, the upper shots, the dizzy feel in the 'tripping' sequences, MIdsommar is a visual fiest. The amount of detail in the houses and walls and paintings all make the world feel alive and real. And all these beauty... in a horror movie. The apporach is just a new look at the genre of fear.Also, I am a huge 'Radiohead', so as soon as I see these gorgeous pictures of nature, I got a lot of 'Burn the Witch' vibes.
The story is solid, though it has some issues. The first 1 and a half hour are mostly buildup , no problem with that and the third act might make somepeople feel disappointed and confused, but I kind of liekd it. Sure, it does not go to full extremes or uses every information we've gotten before, but we get 2 or three really disturbing and out of this world scenes and the thematic of the film about manipulation of the weak and sad and also the theme of family and bonds are explored beatifully.Till the end, we get some great scenes with characters interacting with each other, some intentionally hillarious scenes with a guy frm the group working as really funny comic relief and I kind of loved how this iflm respects its audience.The perfromaces are in most parts really good, the soundtrack is so atmospheric and dear lord, the ending scene is the most beautiful and horrific scene I've seen in a while. This is actually the best way to describe the film Beautiful and horrifc at the same time.Okay, it is not for everyone. The pacing is slow, it could be shoerter for sure, nobody will ever really get it, but that's not to say I did not enjoy it.
It is disturbing and a magifisently looking film for sure and even though my feelings for it are weird, I know I'll have a hard time getting tihs one out of my mind.Let my hullicinating nightmares about flowery Swedish blonds and bears in cages begin.",8,2,10,29 August 2019
La La Land," Here's to the ones who dream!
","Some days ago I travelled to a beautiful land called ''La la land'...La la land is not just a musical.It's not just a love story or just a classic romance film with a happy couple at the end.It's a movie about dreams and hope,love and passion,music and dance.It's a masterpiece and we must all admit it.After the success of 'Whiplash'',Demian Sazel produces 'La la land'with Rian Gosling and Emma Stone being the protagonists as Seb and Mia.Mia and Seb believe in the right of dreaming and they both want to make their dreams come true.Mia wants to become an actress and Seb to open his own bar full of jazz music and chicken.They fall in love with each other and together they try to deal with their difficulties and make their dreams come true!La la land is a musical that will make the audience stand up and start dancing like crazy.It's a film with unforgettable songs like 'City of stars' or 'Audition' that will make everyone to feel extraordinary happiness.The songs fit perfectly with the scenes and make us either laugh out loud or burst in tears.The structure of the film is based on the four seasons of the year.This is a really clever move because when ,for example,it was fall,that meant that the couple will start to have fights and argue with each other. The performances of the actors were awesome. Emma Stone,one of my favorite actresses, was excellent and Ryan Gosling,one of my favorite actors, made me like jazz music!La la land is a film that compares the happy side of life and the desire of dreaming with reality and shows the importance of love and hope.It's the best musical I've ever seen so far!The final scene of the move,which is probably the best one because it makes the movie special and heart-breaking, will make a lot of people cry and with the same way the other scenes that are full of music and dance will make a lot of people to dance like crazy.La la land is a film that stays with you until it makes you wake up..It's a movie that makes you laugh,cry,dance,sing,feel love and of course dream big.As Emma Stone,after winning the award of the best actress in the Golden Globe awards,said:'This is a film for dreamers and I think that hope and creativity are two of the most important things in the world and that's what this movie is about.So,to any creative person who's had a door slammed in their face or anybody that feels like giving up,they must get up and keep moving forward. 'La la land is the best movie of 2016.I have watched it three times in the cinema so far and I want to see the particular movie again and again until I become part of La la land,the city full of love,songs and dreams.With great actors,fantastic songs, a beautiful background of L.A. and with a really thought-provoking story,La la land is clearly a land that all of us would like to visit!",9,3,6,23 December 2016
3 Idiots," Funny,Indian,Beautiful...a life lesson!
","3 idiots. Whoever hasn't watch this movie... is an idiot!Firstly, the movie talks about two friends who are searching for their long lost companion. They revisit their college days and recall the memories of their friend who inspired them to think differently, even as the rest of the world called them 'idiots' The film gives us the opportunity to learn what life means,to stop believing that life is a race and shows that if we want to do something,nobody can stop us from doing it!I liked some quotes from the movie like 'Al is Well' or 'Pursue experience and success will follow,pants down!'. Moreover,it includes jokes that make the whole movie lovely and really entertaining!The actors play really well,allowing anyone who is watching the film to become a part of it!.Furthermore,the funny songs and the wonderful images traveled me in India and in the Indian culture!There are not specific disadvantages!Although,the title could have been either 'Life of Idiots' or 'Life of Rancho!' These three hours that I spent to watch this movie where the best three hours of my entire life!Maybe this movie isn't the most famous one,but for me is it is the best!In this movie 'All is Well!!!'",10,0,1,23 June 2016
A Clockwork Orange," Viddy well, Stanley Kubrick. Viddy well.
","A Clockwork Orange is a haunting and powerful fable told by the unique and foreshadowing eyes of a true creator, Stalney Kubrick.The whole movie feels so exotic and out of this world. The colours, the weird sets and the shiny furnitures, they all create a sense of alienation, but the irony is that this story is really realistic and grounded.We perceive the film through the view of Alex, the protagonist. Alex is a troubled anti-hero. He has fun with the pain of others and is commited to sex and ultra-violence, but soon he falls into a neverending black hole and he faces the true evil of the movie-the ones who want to turn him into something he cannot be.Alex is used as a tool to an experiment which turns scoundrels like him into noble men.We have sen that Alex loves his criminal life and nature, he cannot live without it and when they force him to change and pretend to be a good man, he naturally cannot. And they treat him in the worst way possible. He is like a thing to experiment on and he is spit on and I felt that really nobody eserves such a life, even Alex.The real monters and sinners are the goverment and the men who do these experiments. Kubrick also questions what is considered noble and what not. Alex and his gang go in the same infamous bar with famous singers, the officer inspecting Alex reveals an animalisitc expression when he sees a naked woman, some of the characters just treat Alex with a barbaric way.It is a really thought-provoking film, but the filmmakin aspect-oh lord. The use of music is sensational. Vivaldi and Bethoven are instanlty mxed with horrific, brutal images and the result is fun and memorable. The colours are also fresh and the clothes, the way the rooms are lighted and decorazed gives th film another feel -one of being at a far-away world, but the simularities with ours are so obvious. The different and crazy vocabulary is so fun to listen to. The way the camera moves when the characers walk to halls, the closeups to the Jesus' schalptures, the fast-forward in the sex scene, the slow motion, hte subtle pull back in the first scene... I can go on an on.'It's not fair! It's not fair that I should feel sick when I hear lovely, lovely Ludwig Van!'Not fair indeedUnforgettable film",9,1,2,2 August 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's swan song is about human desires and sex- I'm obsessed
","'Eyes Wide Shut' is Kubrick's last film and the conclusion to my summer Kubrick Marathon. During those days, that the honour to watch these weird and effective stories come alive from maybe the most influensial director of all time and one of my favorites for sure. Eyes Wide Shut is a weird experience and it differs from any other Kubric film. It is a film which can be seen from many angles and in order to be fully understood and appreciated, it has to be viewed multiple times.In the film, Kubrick grows deep into our very own human desires for sex, truth, connection, consumerism and creates a 'universe' where everything is shiny and we get to take a look to how consumerism and money have changed the world and everyone has become more or less a being that gives full attention to what people think about them and how they look. As I see it, the couple of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman can be seen a mirror to the society that Kubric wants to portray during the whole film. The husband eagerly consumes without giving a second thought, tries to meet new women and engage with them, he cannot stop trying to achieve his sexual goals and money and generally his whole economical and social state is a ticket for completing his desires. Notice that his first line in the film has to do with his wallet or that he does not hesitate to give money even if he does not need do. His consuming nature and desire for more and more are viewed by his long walks from place to place and his whole obsession with that orgy mask party. He goes to gritty extremes and I love those scenes which purely reveal his obsessive nature. Cruise is a blast and let's not forget that 1999 was a blast for him, because he was exceptional is Magnolia too.The wife is more of a self-lover, a narcissist. She hold the title 'of a beautiful lady' and we can see that see always car about her looks and likes it when people call her pretty with flattering words. One of the shots that reveal her nature Is the shot where the couple kisses in front of the mirror naked and the wife looks at her self while she is passionately kissed by her husband. She is also haunted by her dreams of another handsome man having sex with her and the idea of cheat poisons her souls but she actually cannot let it go. The dreams reveal her deep desires for another more free love, an affair out of all this and her inability to escape all this devastates her.And dreams do play a really important role in this film. I think that in the end this film has an uncertainness to it. A lot of objects and scenes give you the impression that they might be a complete lie, something fake. We are not sure if the crazy and alienating elements are a matter of imagination or a symbolism or even real. Therefore, the film has a dream-like atmosphere.
Kubrick's direction and the style definitely boost this fantasy element. Most of the scenes use colorful lightbulbs hanged in every room and street to provoke that tone (anyways, it is set during Christmas). The slow move of the camera during the walks of Tom Cruise in the night, the blues and reds, the clever choices of switching between steady and shaky cam, the dream sequences...The technical aspects are great, like every other Kubrick film, though some sequences, especially during the 2nd half feel kind of weirdly shot and this is probably because Kubric's sad loss during the shooting. Leon Vitali, Stanley's loyal sidekick handled the shootings till the end and finished the film, but I think that some sequences felt more of Hitchcock or PTA than actual Kubric. That made the film kind of messy and less captivatingAnd this is m main bug too. It is not that I hated anything in the film, it is a really interesting film and you can make a lot out of it, but I felt kind of bored and uninterested during some parts , like it lacked a true consistency and core.Overall, the film is pretty good. Its cinematography, camera and soundtrack are perfect. Great performances. The script is a different thing compared to Kubrick's previous films and I liked that Stanley wanted to talk about humans and the society by using a single couple with a weird relationship. It is about desires, deceit, love, lies and truth, identity and it hinges on the consumeristic and 'oriented-by the-looks' society that we are living in. As a fact, I feel that it is a film that I prefer thinking than watching, at least for now. But anyways...every Kubrick film demands multiple watches.I also want to add that I felt that the story might be a huge reference to Adam and Eve? A man and a woman naked succumbing into cheating and sinnery??? Well that's a bingo. And I appreciate that Kubrick movies are so open to theories and analysisKubrick is and will always be one of the most creative and genius filmmakers of all time. His films are crazy and unique and mad and funny and colorful and cool and meaningful and true and 'Eyes Wide Shut is no exception.And I love himAnd you know, there is something important that you need to do as soon as possible...What's that?Watch this film (or rewatch it )",8,1,1,10 August 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Hooked on the Guardians
","The Guardians are back and they surely do not disappoint.The MCU creates an emotional,really entertaining and important film.It is not as good as the first one,but deserves to be watched.Just imagine Baby Groot dancing like crazy while the other members are trying to fight a huge monster in one of the first scenes.How better can it get?One thing that I really liked in this film is that it is deeper that the first and has an emotional tone,something that we rarely see in superhero films.It shows the real meaning of family and friendship and emphasizes on team work and sacrifice.It makes the audience move to tears and feel the particular film.The soundtrack was PERFECT!I loved Mr.Blue Sky,The Chain,Fox on the Run,Father and Son!It was energetic and it was combined perfectly with the scenes.Another advantage of the film was the character development.Yondu/Mary Poppins was maybe the best character of the film,because he was funny,cool and at the end proved that he's is a hero and a great daddy!Star Lord and Rocket were cool.Gamora and Nebula developed a great relationship with each other.Dax was really cool!He was funny,emotional and did exactly what he needed to do as a character.Baby Groot was really entertaining and cute,but he could have had a more important role in this film.Mantis,one of the new characters had a clever power and I liked the way they designed her look.The only character that I did not particularly liked was Ego,Star-Lord's Father.He was not the appropriate villain for the film and the idea that he was a planet and person at the same time was clever but over-fleshed.Except from Ego's character,I thought that the plot was a little weak and that the Guardian's story was less important than the first one.Although it had a great introduction and the movie included a lot of impressive action scenes,the story did not fully capture the guardian's greatness.The film provides great humor,touching scenes,cool characters and it has the same style as the first one.I especially liked the emotional ending.A perfect funeral.Fireworks all around the galaxy.Father and Son.How can you not cry?All in all,the guardians strike back in a powerful way and they do not only kick butt.They show to us that when we drop the ego whether it's our personal ego or our crazy planet god father named Ego then we can learn to value life and be with the more important things that could already be standing right next to us. The ones we love",7,7,12,10 May 2017
Joker," 'I respect those who tell the truth, no matter how hard it is!!!'
","Hi, everyone I just checked out 'Joker' and know I get why this one is so divisive. You see, Joker is already a thing. It is in the news, people love it for its message, others say it's political garbage and me:
Joker is... actually pretty good.
Let's get the easy stuff out of the way. Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular, mad, chaotic, out of this world. 'Joker' is a great addition to his monumental collection of gorgeous performances, among with 'The Master', 'Her', 'Walk the Line', 'Sisters Brothers' and I could go on for days. He is a moving force, an unstoppable dynamite and there is a reason why I keep saying that he is the best actor ever. He is so committed and into the role, laughs like Eddie Murphy(actually far better), dances like John Travolta, he truly becomes the Joker. A huge Bravo from me to his majesty!
The movie is actually really well-shot, the framing and the subtle camera movement, the stylish lense flair or the atmospheric, blurry in and out of focus, all add a lot of personality to the film, make it a feast for the eyes and distinguish from the everyday 'box-office fan flick'. The soundtrack is insane, the score, the energy that movie brings, wow. And yes the credits do nail it.
Ok, and know the story. Joker is honest,true,realistic,risky and bold, but also has its cliches and dump stuff, plus i can see the haters boing on this one a lot. But trust me, I think its risks are for the better.
Joker is a depiction of the social and political situation we are living in this moment. Gotham is a dark place, full of unkind and selfish people, fake news, 'happy' shows and 'glamorous' politicians who aim at changing things. And I really mean it, Gotham an our world don't really differ. I think about it and see it everyday, people just doing their thin, ignoring the lives of others, we have lost a part of our humanity through the years, we avoid greeting, we ignore the poor and beggars, we have built a wall of classes and politicians never do anything for that. I am not such of a politics guy, I hardly read any articles about politics, but I cannot avoid the fact that the world has turned into a ark and lonely one, one in which is ruled by the important and famous ones, the ones that 'matter', it is a black hole, a rubbish dump, as the film suggests . Joker is a person who has suffered form his childhood and is bullied, lied by the others, he has never really felt actual joy for something, he is suffering and in it not even his fault. The socieiety judge him and makes fun f him, he is barely noticed and the only relationship he shares is the one with his mother. He is a product of this cruel society and he is treated so badly, so the society makes him the Joker, a insane man. He decides to become important, to change things to beat cruelty with chaos and this is his world and even I don't approve his actions, well they are understood. Hate provokes hate, violence leads to nothing but violence. Joker was just Arthur, a dude who wanted to be a comedian and bring joy to people, but his pathisis and .the people around him turned him into Joker. And Joker wants to show that that the world is wrong. That it's the world that insane and he is the sane one. He faces a world full of mean and gridy people, who want to make everything look happy and nice through the telly and the shows and the ads and we must hide our porblems and sadness and ignore the sadness and despair around us, because the ones in the high place will fix it and everyone says 'DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY', 'KEEP CALM', 'JUST DO IT', like it is an easy thing to do, but no it isn't. And you know, I kind of agree. He is the monster the world created. The world has to pay for the mistakes of every person and system that never cared for anyone, that made everything an 'industry' and left the humanity behind. We are a mad, unfair, cruel and a self-destructive for sure. We deserve everything and we must face the awful truth. It just takes a clown to do that.
And I just imagined gathering all the presidents and kings and political party's and showing this film in a special screening or something. Just think if their reactions. They would hate to see the truth in front of their eyes, they would hate it. And apparently,so does every big critic's website and newspaper. 'Social commentary at its worst', 'Political junk', they call it. I call these critics what Venom called Eddie Brock in that elevator scene. It is funny, isn't it? The film has actually bedcome what it represents. People love it, consider worth of thinking and discussing, while the industrial sites and websites boo it and give it a negative glance. Just like Joker himself.
And I cannot wait to find what the big award shows, like the Oscars, will think of this film. Will they give it any nominations or ignore it because of its political ideology? From the one side, the film is really well-received and it has had a huge appeal, but from the other side its political and social ideologies are far too big and honest for American Tv.
Okay, still it is not perfect. There some really cheesy shots and sequences, but in order to fully express my bags with I need to go to spoilers, which I won't. I am actually going to post a spoiler review for the film to get in-depth.
Joker is a really good movie. It is brilliantly shot and directed, it has a distinct personality, especially when compared to other 'superhero films', it is works perfect as character study and the political and social commentary makes it quite tasteful. And, last but not least, Joaquin Phoenix proves for one more time that he is a monumental 'performer'.
Call me mad, but I think that this film is quite prophetic and might also have to a small but important change and for the better. a world where we will have a reason to laugh, live and
Smile
But, the true question is... is it better than Venom?
Only time will tell",8,3,6,7 October 2019
Arrival," No words.
","One thing is clear.When the movie arrived it shocked me.From the first scene until the last it was worth it.It is a must-see.But,for those who haven't seen it,let me give an advise.Try to read and see as less things as possible about Arrival before you see it.The director,Denis Villeneuve,who is now working on the sequel of Blade Runner did an excellent work turning the wonderful plot of Eric Haisserer. into a high-quality film.The movie is based on the novel 'The Story of your Life'which i really want to read.One advantage of the movie is that turns a classic plot,that aliens visit Earth with some huge vessels and then wait,into a story talking about humanity,love and mostly the meaning of language.Amy Adams played her role in away so realistic that it may be sure that she will take the Oscar of best actress this year.Although Emma Stone and Natalie Portman will be surely nominees,Amy Adams was just perfect.Well,the truth is that she played a really interesting and clever character,Louise,who is a linguist who tries to talk with the creepy,strange aliens.She is a character that has a lot to share and with really important abilities that will help people to find a solution.Jeremy Renner,plays Ian,the scientist that helps Louise to solve the problem.Their relationship becomes really strong as we can observe that they come closer to each other and share their experiences.I think that the movie is awesome due to one fact.It isn't like the other alien movies,that people need to survive for the aliens and fight them...but it provides to the audience a really strong meaning,the importance of language and how it connects us and changes us in a great way. Meanings.theories,ways of life,ways to look,to learn and to understand are hidden into words.The movie contains an excellent twist that effects the whole movie and makes it even more complicated.I was also surprised by the design of the aliens,that have seven legs and write with a code of cyclical nature,instead of the typical structure of words an letters.The 'flashbacks' are excellent scenes among with the scene that Louise talks with the aliens in person and she finally understands why they came there.These scenes make the movie a film of high quality and beautiful cinematography!All in all,Arrival is a movie talking about the borders not only between people but also between the pieces that build ourselves.With a perfect combination of science-fiction and drama,it is one of the best movies of the year.After Arrival I have really high expectations about Blade runner 2049 which will be also directed by DenisAnd,who knows,maybe these aliens arrive again...but this time their coming for the Oscars!Sorry,but I can'y say more.Because,very fittingly,I don't find the words in order to say more.",8,6,15,12 December 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," one word...perfection!
","I have heard that the movie is among the best and that is a must-watch.So,I decided to check if that is true. Believe me,the movie was just perfect.Not,only for its drama scenes and for the acting of Morgan Freeman,the movie clearly shown the power of hope and the meaning of freedom,described in a marvelous way.Particularly,i loved the scene when Andy,the protagonist,tries to cheer up the prisoners by talking about the importance of hope and how it can help them survive and believe in a better word.Also,the movie shows through violent scenes how prisoners where turned into slaves,that couldn't feel for just as second...alive!Both Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman played their role totally perfect,making themselves part of a cruel,dark jail!After its tremendous ending I had no words.The movie had reached perfection and became enemy favorites.Finally,when I went to sleep I couldn't forget the magic of the film,that surrounded me and took me away...",10,0,0,11 August 2016
Parasite," 'Call me by your Name' meets 'The last of the Mohicans' - a brilliant cinematic acievement
","'Parasite' is freaking awesome.It is a comedy, a family drama, a thriller, a horror, a political comentery, a social drama, a an action piece, you have to watch it to believe it. It is just every cool, fun and clever movie shrinked into 2 hours and 15 minutes of pure and unstoppable laughter, some masive and engaging thrills and a story about the distinctio of classes and th edynamic of a family trying to make ends meet.The cinematography is really distinct andI like that Asian films have a reather common but unqiue look and tone and creates a magical atmosphere and tone. The way the camera moves is so sweet and subtle, the framing, the long shots, it is just so fun to watch. The lighting is beautiful, the way certain rooms are lit give a darker or lighter tone. It never tries to show off and everytihng feels so organic that at one point you forget you are watching fictional characters and a made-up story.The soundtrack is another thing to praise of. Most of the tracks are classic music and although it often feels so contradictory to the film, the result is so great and so much personality was added to the movie.The great thing is that despite that the characters have not such a deep arc or are given any major traits, I was able to connect with them in the end and the whole film feels like a big family struggle. You grow with them and graually start to care, in site of their anethical and cheaty choices and actions. Evey actor gives such an appealing perormance and some of their reactinons are really on spot.The humour is there mostly during the first hour. It is seet and it feels genuine, it what family members would talk and joke about. It creates an intimacy and a fun time. Then we get a lot of shifts in the tone and the twists come and go and the great thing is that the film is constalnty on the go, it is always moving forward and does not waste any moment...and in the end the Parasite is a great story toold in the best way possible.The political comentary is perfect. There is actually a film that was released last and I vastly enjoyed... 'Burning'. Biurning was about a trouble guy feeling mad that his friend is dating a ritch successful man and he has nobody and actually talks about class discretions in a fascinting way. Parasite does the sam thing but in a different way. In the movie, we see a poor family trying to work together to scam some narrow-minded ritch family that live in a huge house with their luxuries and all. It is what 'Us' went for but done in a more clear nd subtle way. The ritch use the poor and the poor try to become the ritch. You either leave in a fancy house with a garden and a maid or in the ground floor with insects and a smell. It is like two different words that slowly destroy each other.
I will not say more. Watch this film and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I laughed, gasped, fell into thoughts, I was moved and always wanted more. It is a genius fraud, it has several 'peach scenes', a crazy artistic kid, a birthday party and just make a plan and go watch. In fact, don't make a plan. Just watch it.",9,0,3,20 October 2019
Paths of Glory," 'We're living in a world that's blowing itself to pieces as fast as everybody can arrange it.'
","I just started a Kubrick Marathon this summer and I chose to start with this film and it was a pleasure to experience such a well-presented anti-war film. Kubric is a filmmaking genius and proves it both with his interesting camera work and with the direction he chooses to talk about war and humanity.
At first,we get to see the uglyiness and unfairness of war even without seeing the Germans, who in this case, are the enemy. We get to see how unfair and ust plain stupid and politicly-driven can a war be by watching an insident in the battlefiled of the French army. The soldiers are acussed of cowerdness but they actually could noto do anything because the attack was impossible.And the commander says that 3 random soliders have to die in order to give a lesson the other soldiers.The men with the most power are so arrogant and cunning hat only seek for their own good and do not care about the human lives. A life t them means nothing and they do not understand that a human is a being with emotions and wants love and care and is not a robot made to please every higher force.And there we have Kirk Dougles' character who is the face of ethics and truth. He cares for every singl life of his men and rightably argues to any wrong or immoral decision. He is an unstoppable force and craves for the better.And then we have the three exceptional performaces of the 'guilty' soliders who have been chosen to die for a nonsnese. And it hurts to see young men lose their soles for such a wrong and barbarian order. The monlogue of one of the soldiers about him and the insect that by the time he dies the insect will closer to his wie than him is so true and difficult to swallolw. And all this for a stupid order of a stupid arrogant being.The ending is pure genius. The soldiers desprately cry by listening to a german singer and their sadness and pain and everything that this war has caused to their soles, their longing of family and peace is depicted through their sad and lost faces. And then Kirk Douglas gives a memorable smile, which as I see it, means that he was definately right form the begining. Humans are humans. They can't like a perfect being because being tired and dizzy and not being able to move on are situatin that we all face. And the tears of these soldiers signify that war damages and poisons are nature. War and these stupid men of power torn human nature apart. Humans are afraid and angry and feel pain. We ain't guns, we have a soul.Kubrick delivers a film which offers so many ideas about war that it is impossible not to keep thinking about the film. His camera work is provoking and we should cnsder that this is a film made in the 60's. Every choice, from technical aspects to the main critic on war and poltiics and religion is bold and it is striking to see a film with such a moral compass.A glorious film.",9,1,2,1 August 2019

The Thin Red Line," 'Wars don't ennoble men, it turns them into dogs, poisons the soul.'
","'What's this war in the heart of nature? Why does nature vie with itself? The land contend with the sea? Is there an avenging power in nature? Not one power, but two?'
These first lines ar the main theme of this astonishing film 'The Thin Red Line'. The particular movie is so effective and immersive because of a technique that the visionary director Terrence Malick uses in multiple of his films. In various parts in the film we actually get to hear the thoughts and worries of various characters as they are all faced with the insane madness and cruelty of the nature of war.They all question about death, their lives and the thing noboody can quite grasp is how this one and only world can be so beautiful and dark at the same time?The war takes place literally in the heart of nature. We get tranquil pictures and astonishing shots of peace and bless. The light of the sun passing through leaves, crystal clear lakes and sees, animals climbing and living in this enviroment, humans being a family...And then all these heavenly images are torn apart by bombs and bullets. Eveything alive turns into dead in a second. In war there is no sign of peace or life. We see that war turns mosot of the men either into mad killermen or into beings who have lost any hope and war has taken all the love and beauty from their young soles. And our protagonist claims that no-there is a better world, a shining one and human can still be one.This film is not about events or hisotry dates. It is never informative or aims at telling a historic event with clearness and truth. Rather than that, it astonishes the viewer with its shocking cinematography-both the beauty of nature and the futility of war are shown-its maybe even impossible to answer questions about the start and end of war,love,us.... and it is like a living soul whispering to our ears and sharing the dark truths of a grand universe. Nobody ever won in a war. We all lost a part of ourselves and a part of our world.'This great evil. Where does it come from? How'd it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us? Robbing us of life and light. Mockin' us with the sight of what we might've known. Does our ruin benefit the earth? Does it help the grass to grow, the sun to shine? Is this darkness in you, too? Have you passed through this night?'Beautiful, tender and immersive",9,1,2,30 July 2019
Her," I love Her
","Her is a deep end thought-provoking film that makes the audience understand the meaning of love .Its importance and the many forms it can take.But most of all it makes us point out how love can effect our lives.The story,which is breath-taking,is about a man who falls in love with an operating system,which is named Samantha.It focuses on their beautiful relationship as they learn more about each other.I have to admit that this love story is one of the most original,interesting and heartbreaking I've ever seen.Joaquin Phoenix's performance is outstanding and the other actors such as Amy Adams and Olivia Wilde are really satisfying.Scarlett Johnson really fits the role of Samantha because of her sweet voice.The music is wonderful and it's combined with the scenes in a great way.I loved that the music did not sound as it was form the future,but was slow and calm and made me feel more about this extraordinary film.Her gives emphasis on how essential love is and on the way it effects human emotions.Love makes us feel happy,sad,angry,afraid.It can lead us to laugh out loud or burst into tears or even see life in a different and more exciting and meaningful way.It also depicts how technology can change our lives.From really advances video games to a new way of making friends.However,it can also lead us to become more disconnected and miserable,as shown in the film.I also loved the complex and lovely relationship between the two protagonists and how they communicated with each other.Moreover,what I was astonished by was the fact that film made me sure that even if Samantha was a computer,her feelings and her love about Theodore were true and not fake.Through him she learned how to feel love,happiness and sadness.She became more than a human because she learned how to love.As a whole,Her proves to be one of the most original,existing and moving films I'ever seen.I have fell in love with Her.I have fell in love with this movie.I know,I am a freak.Because everybody who falls in love is a freak.It's a crazy thing to do.",10,0,0,14 July 2017
