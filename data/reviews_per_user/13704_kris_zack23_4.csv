The Avengers," Cheap plot, but good action scenes though
","The plot is very bad and very predictable, this is just a regular comic book movie with a great action scenes and CGI. But the story messed it all. Loki as the main villain is very bad. He didn't look as great as Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight The Avengers kinda focused only on Iron Man. It should be called Iron Man and Friends. Hawkeye and Black Widow need a bigger role. The Hulk pants doesn't really logical isn't it? Joss Whedon screw this movie. It doesn't come up to my expectations even though everybody calling it a very good movie. Captain America and Thor fight should be won easily by Thor, it doesn't really make sense how Cap could be evenly strong as Thor. The ending is bad too. Are you serious right now, Joss Whedon? Waking Iron Man up with a scream from The hulk?",1,10,35,5 May 2013
Iron Man 3," Bad plot, Good action scenes
","So the plot doesn't really going anywhere, not like Iron Man 1 or Iron Man 2 which both movies lead us with their great story into the Avengers movie. But RDJ's acting is great as usual and the action scenes are very great. Very disappointed with the story though, it's like they running in the same circle in the whole movie. The MARVEL objective of this story kinda messed-up and it didn't felt like it will lead us into The Avengers 2, which I hope it will be on Thor upcoming movie and Captain America's also Nick Fury The director weren't make the IronMan look bad ass like in The Avengers who can fight aliens and other than human beings, the iron man role was barely shown and RDJ holding a gun rather than in an Ironman suit. It kinda looked opposite from The Avengers so yeah, it doesn't really meet to my expectations.",1,6,14,5 May 2013
Man of Steel," Much More Better Than Superman Returns
","The darker and more mature theme makes it not so comical compared to SR, and a lot of action scenes which is lacking from SR. The flaws about this movie is that Kevin Costner dies for saving a dog's life, it's so hilarious how he risked his life for a dog, and the ending action scenes are too much just like Transformers. Great story with the Krypton universe being explained to the audiences and also the Kryptonian Warsuit about how it being explained about the 'S' logo. I noticed there is a LexCorp fuel tank vehicle but I didn't see the Wayne Enterprises logo which was mentioned by a lot of people. Overall a MUST WATCH movie, even for non CBM fans.",8,0,2,15 June 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Great movie, but TDK is better
","The plot is very good and unpredictable, the story is amazing just like The Dark Knight. Nolan did a great job doing this movie with a very huge expectations from the movie critics following the huge success from the earlier sequel, The Dark Knight in 2008. The Catwoman role was bigger than I thought it would be, she was an enemy but then became Batman's partner Tom Hardy's Bane look terrific and menacing with his control-freak personality and a bit of Joker's agent-of-chaos. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's role is also bigger than it looks like from the trailer, from a young cops to be the new Batman It's very satisfying how Nolan showed us that 'Batman Always Win' and the fact that Bruce Wayne live made my day Overall a very great movie",9,12,19,5 May 2013
