The Blair Witch Project," THIS MOVIE SUCKED!
","I did not like this movie.  It was not scary at all.  As an artsy type of movie it was merely 'ok' but as a whole the movie was horrible.  It was interesting how the media lures the viewer into it making it look like it was a real thing that really happenned when you watch the previews.  But the movie was completely unrealistic.  Honestly, if you were lost in the woods with your friends at each others throats and being chased by God knows what, would you really leave the camera running?  Some crazy critics compared this movie to The Exorcist.  That is pulling The Exorcist down.  The Exorcist had me scared in the first five minutes.  When I watched The Blair Witch Project I wasn't scared.  I sat through the entire movie thinking: When will I be scared?  This movie was not scary.  If you disagree with me then go ahead and e mail me.  Don't tell me that I didn't get it because I did, this film was all hype and NO SUBSTANCE.",Null,0,1,16 August 1999
