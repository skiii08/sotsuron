Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So disappointing!
","I was hoping for a movie as good as the first 3 ones were. Sure, I got fantastic visuals... but scenario full of inconsistencies (remember when Ben tells Luke that he will go to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi master who tought him? well... Lucas now thinks that the Jedi master who taught Ben is now Qui-Gon Jinn... why this turn around)... and full of unneeded add-ons... Whe de medicloreans... did Lucas feel afraid of the religous lobbies that he had to make the Force a physical/biological phenomenon rather than a mystical one? I won't go into the bad acting of Jake Loyd or the cliches of the various non humans we meet... or of the pathetic Jar Jar, or the almost inexistent Darth Maul... And... did anyone actually feel a menace somewhere?There were some great ideas, lightsaber fights are absolutely beautiful... but the movie lacks so much elsewhere.Come on, George, please, don't disappoint us again. And avoid titles that sound like 1960's movies...",3,0,1,25 November 2001
