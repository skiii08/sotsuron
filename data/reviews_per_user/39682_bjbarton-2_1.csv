United 93," an hour of air traffic control and 30 minutes actually concerning united 93
","This movie really disappointed me. I've never been a fan of made for TV movies, but A&E made a movie, titled flight 93 (and I'm fairly sure the A&E version was released first), which I saw prior to seeing this theatrical version, which I would give a ten compared to the 4 I gave this version. The theatrical version severely downplays any heroism you could attribute to the individuals on the flight and focuses more on the insubstantial banter of people in air traffic control rather than most of the true issues. Overall, when you consider the money and time invested in this movie, it is fairly worthless when you compare it to the most likely low budget, but far superior A&E version.",4,6,13,16 September 2006
