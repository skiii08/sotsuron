Captain Marvel," I loved this movie
","No One can deny that Brie Larson was excellent in this film. Some scenes are completely perfect; no defect, no objection. The scene in metro train was fantastic. I expect more prestige from Jude Law but in total it was acceptable.
But the story! I loved that. The only things I hated was oblivion. Why we always use this in films? I think the story had potentials to escape from this stereotype.
Marvel again showed us that believing in yourself is the most important feature of our life. Thus, the main idea was beautiful.
Visually, it was a final version of Marvel Superheros series.",9,1,6,10 July 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," coherent story, a real superhero
","An important matter about a superhero is that he/she must compel the viewer to believe his/her. The most important thing is not, necessarily, his power. Perhaps Captain America is not the strongest one, but I am sure he is the most reliable one. another matter that attract me is that, sometimes, I think an actor helps the character and sometimes vice versa but in this case, the character and actor both helped each other. Of course, the balance is a little for the strong character of Captain America.
and finally, if i were a superhero i prefer it was Captain America because it is supported by a nation.",9,1,3,17 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Unexpected
