The New World," Annoying Pretentious Drivel
","I was really looking forward to this one - a modern retelling of a tale which has been trampled through the lenses of history so often. What I got was just another version of the white man's Indian. This version is circa 2005 which means all the Indians are noble good looking folks living, as the narrator implies, in a world fashioned to the tune of John Lennon's 'Imagine'.Yep, the narrator really explains that these folks have no jealousies, no possessions, never get into disputes, lie, cheat or steal. Clearly they are perfect children of nature living a perfect life until the wascally white man comes there to mess it all up.Not only are the Indians a reflection of the distortions of white folks in 2005, but the main protagonist, John Smith is too. Here's a guy who magically, as only in movies today, never either shaves or grows a real beard. Instead he just has this mossy look all over his face. He just happens to have some neato tattoos and to top it all off, he has long greasy hair and an earring. Gee, who knew that 17th century English folks looked just like 2005 movie stars!! Now that's history research for you.All the Indians and English have perfect teeth. Poke is a hot chick who, despite the fact that the Indians of her tribe never used any metal, has found a razor or maybe a shaver to do her underarms. Clearly she's ahead of her times. BTW, her tribe is never specifically named but I'm sure the translation would be the 'muffin top Indians' due to the roly poly nature of many of them. I guess they got that way eating at Great Spirit Fried Chicken franchises.Skip this ponderously paced idiotic recasting of the tale. It just stinks as bad as a real Indian camp of that era would stink.",Null,0,1,30 July 2011
The Hangover," Took me by surprise
","I as well as my wife truly enjoyed this movie and neither of us expected to. In fact, the entire theater broke up laughing more often than not - and at the appropriate times too. One odd comment is that a family brought their son, perhaps aged 3, to this one and even he laughed at several funny slapstick sort of moments. This kid's laughter caused others like us around him to laugh even more.As a note about kids; this movie definitely earned its R rating. I suppose a 3 year old isn't badly affected by this movie because all the R stuff went over his head, but if you are offended by sex jokes or situations, avoid this one at all costs. Both my wife and I were surprised at how much one can get into an R rating. We thought we'd stumbled into some other rating but then again, I don't know what else their is either.Mostly what's fun about this movie is that it has a good spirit. It's not mean although some of the situations the 'boys' get themselves into can feel pretty tense. If you'll enjoy this movie depends if you have a sense of the absurd as well as if you feel comfortable with openly sexual situations. If you say 'No' to either of those, you just can't enjoy this thoroughly modern absurdest comedy.",9,3,8,21 June 2009
Star Trek," Adds A Few Badly Needed Things to Star Trek
","Sure the hidebound Trekkies have been in full mourn that this isn't a 'real' Star Trek. It isn't which is what makes it good. In place of Kirk wadddling around the universe mouthing childish maudlin mutterings of why we can't all be hippie love each other beings before I blast you with my phaser, this one just rocks.The excitement which was rare in the previous outings is here. Real wonderful sets. Special effects better than I have ever seen and I mean real good ones - not just things blowing up.The best part of this movie as compared to any other Star Trek anything is that this is a genuine ensemble effort. It is not a bombastic Kirk playing off of a stoic Spock with all others there for comic relief or to hold down a chair which would otherwise float away or supplied to be eaten by an alien thus affording Kirk another opportunity to go bombastic before he bombs away.Here the 'others', especially Uhuru really take a part. We see the others like Bones, Chekov, Scotty and so forth as real folks with a contribution to make.In the end, it's not Kirk who saves things single handed, but I won't tell you further. This is the best of all the movies or TV shows by far.I'm signed on for the next voyage.",9,1,8,31 May 2009
Zootopia," Drivel
","Animations can be wonderful even when pitched to children. Toy Story 2 is a great movie plain and simple. I don't mean for an animation it's great, it's great as a story. The open act of Up is as moving as any act in any live actor movie as well. Just because these two examples (of many possible) are cartoon figures, doesn't mean they can't have depth and move us. Not so here. We have the same perky female lead we are now having our faces rubbed in time after time. She's weak but takes on all because, by gosh, there are no limitations to what you can do other than in your own head. It's not that I'm opposed to this message, but rather Disney has pushed this out so often that we either get it or don't so let's move on. Isn't there another message possible? Or gee, let's get radical and have a movie that entertains rather than preaches. What a concept!!!So because it's a plucky female lead, we have no tension. We know that she'll come out ahead and better for the experience and the world will be better because she persisted in her remorseless pluck. Underlying all this for, I suppose, the pervs in the audience, there is some sort of odd sexuality and rather uncomfortable suggestions going on. It's a sour note that doesn't offset the saccharine dominant note but rather only adds a nasty undertone to the production. So the same movie with different characters showing that effort aside from CGI doesn't exist or at least it's died entirely in Hollywood.",3,18,42,21 May 2016
Madagascar," A dreary formula
","Given that this is the same studio which gave us the Shreks, I expected more, but got less. This is a boring movie mostly remarkable for its lack of imagination or use of what could be an interesting plot. The setup is that there is a society of animals which operates at its own level. Animals can all talk to each other, but humans hear them grunt and roar or do whatever animal noises we expect them to make.So here we have the fish out of water played out as a buddy version of the animal out of cage instead. The humor is sometimes toilet, sometimes the 'can't we see the end of this joke' crotch hit, but mostly shouting. So a character will, when the director calls for humor in a non-humorous spot, will shout which is supposed to evoke laughter. It didn't work even for the three year old. The best part of this movie were the coming attractions which, for the most part, didn't even make it into the movie itself. Faked coming attractions? There is absolutely nothing fresh, interesting or creative in this entire show aside from the animation of a lion's mane. It's probably all right to distract the kiddies for a few minutes, but for gosh sakes, there are parents too. Lately the studios have gotten it and provided movies for parents and children both. Prime examples are Mulan, the Shreks, the Toy Storys and Finding Nemo.Sadly, this movie is a high production value equivalent to Plan 9 where those others are equivalent to The Godfather. Avoid if you can.",2,6,13,4 June 2005
Capote," A rather slow and quiet account
","As others have noted, this movie tends to bias toward the view of the killers rather than the killed which I find bothersome. I do not find killers of helpless families to be interesting or romantic. However, that's only part of the film and hardly the center of it.The center is, in fact, the title character. The movie covers several years of Capote's life during which he wrote the book which did change many things in publishing. It made the author the most celebrated author in the US and maybe the world. However, what he had to go through to write the book as well as he did destroyed him utterly.The movie chronicles the destruction of the killers, to some extent the killed and most completely, the author who lost his detachment entirely. It is a picture of an artist, Capote, who sacrificed himself for his art. The art work is great, but it took everything from the artist to create it.My problems with the movie remain mostly directorial. We are often treated to jump mood shots supposed to convey the barrenness of the Kansas USA scenery where the crime took place, but the movie short shrifts how that barrenness played with the people of the area who were affected by the crime. Instead, we're shown seemingly hours of what in reflection, is unrelated Capote verbiage with his companion or with others in the town or prison.Thus the two most affected by the crime, the dead family and the townspeople are ignored in favor of us 'learning about' the criminals and Capote's love life.However, the worst complaint I have about this movie is simple: it's mostly inaudible. This is by far the worst sound I've heard in a modern movie. Capote as a man spoke in a mumbly high lisp which the player does well, but it's frustrating to miss at least 30% of what he says. Ditto the other characters because the director has chosen a documentary hand held camera look to the movie.The sound isn't any better than you'd get with a Super 8 home movie camera crippled by a $3 mic and in a windstorm. That may be the intent of the director, but it means that the movie which is 70% script and 30% performances loses much of the script.Very much worth a viewing or two, but clean your ears well before and pump up the volume.",7,0,0,6 May 2007
Being John Malkovich," missed a point
","I'm amazed that all reviewers seem to have missed what I think the main theme of this movie was and that's the obsession and resulting competition between the main character and his wife for the attention of a vamp. I still think it a terrific movie, but wonder why I seem to have seen it differently than most others.",10,0,0,17 November 1999
Shrek Forever After," Decent If Not As Fresh as 1 or 2
","A good deal of the critical complaining about this one is simply that it's derivative of a well loved Jimmy Stewart classic - _It's a Wonderful Life_'. In a modest way it is, but it also goes its own way enough that it's hardly a duplication of that flick.What bothers me about that complaint is simply that most Hollywood movies today - those loved or despised - are remakes of something which came before. It seems that for maybe 80 years or so, Hollywood was capable of coming up with original material, but lately that has waned. Perhaps the movie makers have become as script conservative as they are politically liberal. I'm not sure.There were perhaps five coming attractions before Shrek 4 started. Of the five, four were clear remakes, some bearing even the same title as the original. One example is the newest _Karate Kid_ which based on the previews probably uses the same script word for word as the original. On the way out of the theater we saw a poster for the upcoming _Predator_ which showed a monster identical to the one which threatened Arnie maybe 25 years ago.So complaining that Shrek 4 borrows thematically from a well loved movie is hardly valid unless you choose to see no movies at all because they all do it today.On the positive side, the movie is engaging. We enjoyed the 3D and I found the textures and animation as good as I've ever seen. I'm wondering if movies such as this have put paid to live human actors. I suspect it's close.No, this one isn't nearly as fresh as the first simply because it's fourth, not first, but it's fine family entertainment with a terrific look and a message which, if not original, is still quite valid. Just sit back and enjoy it.",7,0,1,31 May 2010
Captain America: Civil War," Headache Inducing Mess
","Like all too many productions lately, this one is barely a story, loud to the point of being obnoxious but lavish in its CGI production values. We again have people who seem to have super human abilities but no explanation of how that may have happened or what limits they have on their capacities. At least one of them, a flea sized human, sprouts another capacity in the middle of a fight - again no explanation of how this happened or if this is the end of it. Also their capacity to take punishment seems greatly enhanced. Each of the gets thrown around bouncing off of hard surfaces experiencing no trauma, fatigue or even getting dirty. That is until one of them does get terribly injured from suffering an impact no more than he has suffered countless times in the immediate past. Again, no explanation why this acceleration seriously injured him while the previous 500 similar ones did not. The one saving aspect of this movie is the recognition by the crew and public that them performing their feats leave behind a terrific amount of damage which seems to be a plot point usually ignored in these comic book sorts of movies. I was hoping that they'd consider this but in fact, it only turns into another series of fights where they leave behind more damage including destroying a huge airplane just because they can. So the movie starts to take a path more thoughtful than a typical three year old would like but abandons it almost immediately. Meanwhile there is some sort of other faction made up of Russians who are duplicates or something or other and they factor in somehow as well. Oh, then we have some mythical Edenish African Kingdom and the laughably mysterious addition of yet a new super hero just because at this point the whole thing is so utterly idiotic, well why not? Loud, thoughtless, pitched for five year olds at best but gee, great CGI.",4,15,32,21 May 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Newcomer's Perspective
","Unlike, it seems, everybody else, I'm still a newcomer to the Marvel Universe. I've seen two previous movies - the ones where the raccoon stars but none other. So I was a bit confused as to who everybody was and why they can do the things that they can. Putting that aside, I really marveled at the CGI craft here. I won't say it's the best ever since I'm hardly an expert but it sure was better, in some ways, than what I've ever seen in the past except for Avatar - a movie almost a decade old now. The downside of the CGI was the constant fast cuts meaning, at least for me, little comprehension of the action during fights. I only figured out who won a particular fight after it was over. I never had that issue with Avatar. I'll get right to my issue here. The plot is utterly senseless. The bad guy, who is weirdly the most sympathetic and best developed character, has a plan which is senseless. It can't work even if he achieves his stated goal. However, his ends can be met by other means. I was waiting for a character, any character, to sit down with this guy and together work out a plan which will achieve the bad guy's desires but also cause no misery or destruction. Then too we have the tired issue of time travel not taken. This pervades any show where time travel exists. There's no reason for a time traveler to experience a bad outcome since he can jump back in time as often as needed to remedy the issue. Here, the good guys get the bad guy under their power and are about to prevail when one of the good guys does something moronic which caused the bad guy to escape. Well, Mr. Time Traveler, go back a few minutes so you can stop this from occurring. There are other holes too. People have magical powers which wax and wane. One minute some woman is easily defeated by the bad guy and next is able to fend him off using only part of her power. That sort of inconsistency is rampant. Well, it was a good show even if it bugged me due to it simply doing whatever it wished without attention to what happened previously. I feel I got my money's worth and you'll get more if you also shut your brains off while watching.",7,1,6,12 May 2018
Gran Torino," For Religoius and Others, Refreshing
","Others have commented about most aspects of this movie and I won't try to repeat what others have said well both here and in the professional reviews. Instead, let me focus on one narrow aspect of this movie which I found refreshing.One of the main characters in this movie is a Catholic priest. In every movie of recent vintage, this means a person of overwhelming evil, creepy, and probably a child molester. Here the priest is well spoken, intelligent and adds to the evolution of the main character while the main character adds dimension to the priest.As a personal note, I'm not only an atheist, but have a shade of anti-Catholicism in me too. Yet not in my worst thoughts of religion or the church do I believe that all priests or other Christian clergy are evilly motivated sexual perverts which is what Hollywood of today would have us believe. I'm tired of the same old same old finding this, like so many Eastwood films, thinking its own thoughts rather than following the rutted path of those who (mostly) run the movie industry.Probably a solid 8 or 9 star movie on its own, this one gets a boost from me for being such a relief in its portrayal of the religious.",10,12,26,17 January 2009
Logan," Silly and Typical
","I got this as seatback entertainment on a Delta flight yesterday. I found it annoying, uninteresting and laughable at the same time. It's typical superhero idiocy. Here's the key to this genre. The hero gets the snot beat out of him (or her, I suppose) until either he decides to fight back in earnest or remembers some secret word which causes something or other to happen by majicks. The thing in question opens with a half dozen cholos stealing the wheels off of the title role's car while he's asleep inside of it. He comes out and nicely asks these fellows to cease. They kill him with a shotgun. Undeterred, he returns to life (?) and then tears them apart with majick talons which majickly appear at his knuckles. See? He's defeated and then gets serious. Predictable in the extreme, really. So then he goes to some place which looks like south New Mexico to visit with two oddballs Who Have Majick Powers (of course). One of them is the old captain of a Star Trek TV series, Patrick Stewart, who's in a wheelchair. They are attacked by a gang copy and pasted from a Road Warrior movie led by a Bork from Star Trek. I'm making NOTHING up. The bad guys prevail because it's too soon for them not to. The captain, the guy with the scary knuckles and some girl who was manufactured in Mexico via a bio lab flee. I liked the movie's paying honor to the highly advanced biotech which does exist in Mexico (in secret). About 9 hours later (it felt that way) the bad guys find and attack the group again - this time in a hotel casino. The captain then paralyzes them using his Super Power. I gave it up in disgust at this point. If the captain had used his Super Power back in New Mexico, the movie could have ended then. There's a good deal more that I detested in this mess, but you got my take. 8 stars? This one, other than production values, should be less than Planet 9.",1,10,21,11 July 2017
The Dark Knight," Vastly overrated as of this date
","Unlike many others, I'm not going to rate this a one star to counterbalance the lunacy shown by many IMDb'ers in giving this mediocre outing a 10. I will instead rate it fairly by my estimates.Pretty much all the adverse criticism you'll find by reading the one or two star reviews are accurate. The issue isn't if this movie fails continuity time and time again, but if it matters. After all, isn't this a cartoon? Yet it isn't. I'm not a fan or cartoons or the previous Batman offerings. I consider the 'dark Gothic look' of Gotham City which some so love to be puerile. At the start of this, I enjoyed that instead of fakey doo dark city infested with grotesque characters, we were in Chicago - a reasonably lighted place with humans as the dominant residents.However, if you are going to change the ground rules so you are in normal human space, then you need to adhere by these rules. Having some guy in silly makeup able to appear anywhere even in the company of his continually refreshed gang is jarring to say the least. Where did he get his superhuman cameo powers from? If you wish to posit at the start that the villain isn't human,or has supernatural powers or is an alien like Predator, then OK, but don't make him a human driven by human needs, cut off any back story and then give him powers which could easily defeat both Alien and Pedator.Also for gosh sakes, do a little homework. At one point a fellow removes a pistol from a criminal in court. Like criminals can just waltz into court with handguns so he can then later attempt to shoot the prosecutor. Worse, when the fellow is disarmed the guy doing the disarm move claims it to be a .28 caliber....Good grief. Was that supposed to be a joke or is Hollywood that lazy not to even note that there is no such thing in a modern Glock like pistol.In the end, this is a movie with no bright spots. It's despair all the way. There is no hope for goodness. Instead, we're given the choice between anarchy or oppression. Worse, the oppressive ones are the government who lack the will to deal with the anarchists.",6,8,17,3 August 2008
Avatar," Surprised Conservative Enjoys Avatar!
","Reading the negative reviews here caused me to be predisposed to disliking this flick because the themes heavily criticized, such as left wing liberal ideology along with silly myths about aboriginal populations particularly annoy me. Since my wife was insistent that we do see this one, I tagged along. I am glad I did because I enjoyed the movie enormously.First let me dispose with much of the negativity. The go go US military uber alles complaint that this movie celebrates the defeat of the US military is simply wrong. It's not even partly right. There is nothing correct about this complaint. The 'soldiers' in the movie are mostly or entirely from the US military but they are all separated permanently. This is not a military op of any nation much less the US. The movie just cannot be plainer that this is the case. The main protagonist goes to great lengths to say that he was ONCE a marine, now he's just a guy earning a paycheck.The second complaint most often heard here is that this movie's plot is similar, to a great degree, to many other movies such as Dances With Wolves or Pocahontas or even Ferngully. That this movie is similar to many other movies just proves that there are many movies with similar themes. Funny I can't find any complaint about rom-coms that they are similar to other rom-coms but they sure are. How many sports movies have you seen where the underdog team made up of miserable misfits and being coached by a drunken loser lost in the quarter finals? So what did you expect or want - that the mercenaries would defeat the aliens and maybe use their skulls as decoration for their quarters? C'mon, here, let's get real.On the positive side, unless you have a drastically limited attention span, this movie is a visual treat from start to finish. It moves well along and probably merits several viewings to appreciate all the attention to detail which is apparent even at first viewing.The story is uplifting (even if kinda bunkum) the soaring views wonderfully imagined and the players all did a great job of taking their parts and making them come alive.If you aren't seeing this one because you don't wish to see the US defeated, then see it because you won't. Defeated is a *private* corporation supported by mercenaries - not the US. In fact, the corporation is a joint project owned by Iran and North Korea.Keep that in mind and then get back to me about how you feel about its defeat.",8,2,4,22 March 2010
Toy Story 2," Why have live actors now?
","RE the movie itself, the commercial reviewers say it all for me. I only want to add that I honestly can't see any reason for having wetware actors any more. The *acting* in this movie was superior to that which almost claiming to be an actor can do. And the toys work cheaper too.",9,1,2,8 December 1999
Black Panther," Incoherent
","I'm blown away at how disappointed I was when I finally got to watch this one via Netflix. I'll say it out front: it's incoherent. Sure, the sets and people look good. I especially like the edges on the silly spears the female troops use, but all that production value is tossed aside if not hitched to a comprehensible plot. Here, I am now halfway through the flick and have only the vaguest idea of what's going on. I'll give it another go this evening. I'm unsure if I'll start it again or continue from where I am in hopes something pulls things together for me. I understand the high ratings on this bomb. I too enjoy finally seeing black actors behave like humans instead of caricatures but surely it can be done in a better constructed vehicle.",3,2,3,14 September 2018
Mother!," Your Personal Rorschach Test
","This is where all art is today. To make art today, you assemble the most disgusting elements you can dig up, mash them together and proudly display in all pretension for delusional art critics to fawn over. Here we have an odd collaboration of the lead actress and her current boyfriend as the director which gives us wonderful shots such as close-ups of her nose and the back of her head. From time to time she breaks from her default mode of being the new Great Stone Face to come up with contextually improper muggings for the camera. The 'art' here is twofold. First, to see if you can endure the boredom and second if you can stomach the non-boring parts. Maybe the idea was to show the world that if it's not bored, it's revolted. There is no middle ground. There is no sense which no doubt some critics will laud as a reflection of life where there too, there is supposedly no meaning to anything including our pathetic sterile lives. Miss this if you can.",1,43,81,16 September 2017
