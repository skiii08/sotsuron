Minority Report," What a Complete BOMB!
","Oh God, where to start. First, I'll take issue with the glowing reviews on this site and elsewhere. It stunk! Now to specifics....1. The technology was cartoonish. Judge Dredd looked sophisticated by comparison. 2. The acting was below Made For TV standards. 3. Attempts at tension-breaking humor were pathetic. 4. The chase and escape scenes were contrived and totally unbelievable. 5. Plot holes? HUGE! If you stopped someone from committing a pre-crime, why punish them? They clearly didn't and aren't going to commit that crime. How can you legally imprison sentient human beings even if they are 'precogs?' If they have images of the murderers and everyone in the world has their corneas on file, why not just match up the corneas in the precog images? The concept is intriguing. In the hands of competent writers, directors and actors it could have been great. It wasn't. So sorry I wasted over two hours watching this drivel.....",1,5,10,5 May 2011
Spirited Away," Are U Kidding Me?
",What are you people smoking? The greatest movie ever made? What a colossal waste of three hours of my life. It was my son's turn to pick the movie for movie night and he had it waiting on the DVR for weeks. I have never seen such a mishmash of crap in my life. Where to begin?The animation was cheesy. The characters without any emotion...except the whiny little brat. The 'plot' was all over the place. There were more holes in this plot than in SpongeBob's rear end.A 60 year old Popeye cartoon had superior animation and character development. NEWS FLASH! The Emperor has no clothes and this film sucks!-djfisher,1,23,98,20 April 2011
