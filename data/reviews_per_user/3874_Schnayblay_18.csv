Black Swan," An Incredibly Beautiful and Epic Tale That Is Perfect in Every Sense of the Word
","'Black Swan' was a film I had on my must see list for a long time. Natalie Portman was enough to draw me in, but I had heard nothing but good things about this. Add the fact that Natalie Portman finally got the recognition I always knew she deserved by getting an Oscar for this, and you have my interest. And after finally seeing it, I understand why everyone loves this movie. And I agree with them.So the story of 'Black Swan' is about Nina, a very fragile but lovable ballerina who is given the role of her life when she is cast as the Swan Queen in her ballet studio's production of Swan Lake. But the catch is that she has to play both the Swan Queen and the Black Swan, who is the evil and polar opposite twin sister of the Swan Queen. Everyone knows that Nina is perfect for the Swan Queen, but she has to really push herself to become the Black Swan which totally goes against her nature. Meanwhile she also is having a mental breakdown so there's a lot of freaky stuff going on in her mind. The cool thing that you realize at one point is that the story of the film is a real life parallel to the story of Swan Lake. All the characters, situations, and plot points reflect the ballet but it doesn't feel cheesy. It feels brilliant and beautiful.Now the acting in this movie is terrific. Did Natalie Portman deserve her Oscar? Absolutely without a doubt. I'm gonna be honest, ever since I was six and saw her in 'Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace', I knew Natalie Portman was destined to be an incredible actress. That and I have an insane celebrity crush on her, but that's beside the point. She is perfectly natural, believable, and lovable as Nina and you instantly fall in love with her character. While she's having her mental breakdown though you are really worried what's going to happen. Nina is so sweet and innocent you don't want to see a shred of harm come to this girl. That is true character connection and it was done amazingly in 'Black Swan'.Mila Kunis plays Lily, who is basically the real life equivalent of the Black Swan. She's the exact opposite of Nina. She's fun, secure, she goes out and parties. She is basically every 20 something year old hot chick on 'Jersey Shore'. But she has this very evil sense about her and you're always thinking in the back of your mind 'She could just flip and kill Nina at any time'. There's this one scene where Nina and Lily go to a bar and you can really see how opposite they become. But you also see how Lily slowly corrupts Nina and it's just a genius character dynamic. That is good writing and equally strong acting right there.There is only one more performance I think I need to mention and that's Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother. Nina's mom is just like Mrs. White from 'Carrie'. She is obsessive, controlling, psychotic, and just evil. You really hate her and it takes you a while to realize it but eventually you have an epiphany where you go 'Oh my god, Nina is like a hostage in her own home'. She's 27 but she still lives with her mother because her mom is so insane. Nina's mom puts off the same evil sense as Lily in that you feel she could snap and murder Nina in like a second if she was pushed even a little bit. It's a very scary character and Barbara Hershey portrayed it perfectly.I do want to mention that anytime the 'Swan Lake' music played, I could not help but think of 'Dracula'. I don't know if you know this, but the original 1931 'Dracula' movie with Bela Lugosi used the 'Swan Lake' song for its opening credits. And so anytime I heard that music, I got tingles. The music in this movie, especially in the finally is tense and exciting and does exactly what a good soundtrack should do. It gets you really anxious and nervous and I'm not lying when I say I felt my heartbeat while the climax of this movie happened and it was racing. There is so much emotional weight at the end 'Black Swan', I could not believe I was so invested in a film about ballet.This movie is perfect, and I have zero complaints. The acting was terrific, the pacing was perfect. The emotional weight and the themes were handled with exquisite and expert care. I do not think I can stress how beautiful this film is. It's rare that I call a movie beautiful but it is the only word I can think of that describes this movie. It is perfect.",10,0,2,11 July 2012
Men in Black 3," Decent as a Popcorn Flick, But a Poor Entry for THIS Franchise
","I was never too intrigued to see 'Men in Black 3'. After hearing about all the problems during the production of the film, I wasn't too hopeful about how the final product would come out. So I skipped watching it in the theatre, and had no real plans of seeing it in the foreseeable future. The only reason I did end up seeing it was because my mom spontaneously bought it. And should I have given this movie more credit? Yes. But maybe not as much as I've heard other people give it.The whole plot of this movie is that an alien criminal named Boris escapes from prison and time travels back to 1969 to kill Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), before the Young Version of K (Josh Brolin) can shoot off 1969 Boris' arm. So J (Will Smith) travels back as well to save Young K's life and stop Old K from disappearing from the timeline. There's a whole mess of a lot more but since it's time travel, it's hard to talk about it without spoiling a lot of stuff. I know from just that it sounds very cliché and boring, but trust me it's much more interesting than just that.Now as far as acting goes, it's a sci-fi action/comedy, don't expect Oscar performances. Will Smith headlines, as always, and I don't think I can say a lot about him except its Will Smith being Will Smith. Now, Will Smith can deliver amazing performances like in 'The Pursuit of Happiness', but when he's in a mainstream comedic action blockbuster, you know what you're going to get from him.Now Josh Brolin plays the young Agent K. All I can say is that Josh Brolin as young Tommy Lee Jones is the equivalent of Joseph-Gordon Levitt as young Bruce Willis in 'Looper'. If imitation is a form of flattery, then Tommy Lee Jones is the most complimented guy in the world. Brolin not only nails Jones as K, but Jones overall, throughout his entire acting career. He reflects Jones back in like the 90's where he was taking serious, but not too serious roles where he could be occasionally really funny and Brolin revisits that. It's so cool that even though Tommy Lee Jones is in this one for a total of about 8 minutes, you feel like he's still there the whole time and you're not mad he got cut.The special effects are a little bit more polished than the previous movies, but they still end up looking pretty bad and cheesy. Now some of it works because of the 1969 setting and I'm willing to just fool myself into thinking they're trying to pull the whole nostalgic throwback that 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' did with its alien and the 1950's setting. I know that's not at all what 'MiB 3' was going for, but I'll convince myself that they were so that I don't just write the effects off.Now while it's not as apparent as I thought it would be, you can still see the slapdash way it was reported that the script was put together. Throughout this movie you watch all the characters go to a ton of places and through so many situations, it feels like they came up with a bunch of random scenes and just said 'Ok, take these 12 and make a movie out of it'. It doesn't feel like there's any reason for some of these except to remind you it takes place in 1969 and the pace of the story once they get to 1969 feels so weird, there just doesn't feel like there's much cohesiveness. It feels so cut and paste, it honestly detracted a lot of the fun from the movie. While some of these scenes are funny, their reasons for being in this film feel non-existent.Now the tone of this film is so, (forgive the pun), alien to this franchise that it feels like a brand new movie. The first two films have a steady tone, but this one feels like it's trying too hard to fit into a new generation, it's almost like the film has forgotten its fan base. I didn't feel like I was watching a new 'Men in Black' movie, I felt like I was watching some awkward reboot with the same actors being used just to bring the fans of the original to see this new one while the filmmakers seemed to want the fans to forget the old movies. This movie's target audience is not the fans of the original movies, it's just the mass general public, and that really bugs me with franchises that have had a certain fanbase in the past.Overall, 'Men in Black 3' is very enjoyable with an imitation performance that matches Joseph-Gordon Levitt's in 'Looper', some fun moments and classic time travel mind games, but it's definitely not the strongest in the franchise. It's sadly obvious that the script was slapped together, the tone is completely off from the old movies, and it abandons its fans and tries way too hard to appeal to the general public. I'd say it's worth a rental and if you do like it, don't buy it for more than $10 on DVD. Paying the extra few dollars for the Blu-Ray is not worth it. Trust me; you will not be missing out.",7,0,2,4 December 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Everything That Worked in it's Predecessor is Thrown Out and Made More Generic
","I was really excited to see 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows'. I highly enjoyed the first film, and with Guy Ritchie returning to direct, and the addition of Jared Harris playing Professor James Moriarty joining the stellar cast, I had little doubt that 'Game of Shadows' would blow me away as much as the first film had. And then the trailer came out, and the doubt started to form. Robert Downey Jr. creepily cross dressing, giant gun fights, and recycled jokes made me worriful that the movie may fall where the first film excelled. Sadly, I was right.Watson has now moved out of 221B Baker Street, and Sherlock has become obsessed with linking evidence to the infinite web of crimes Moriarty is behind. Now, when a single clue reveals itself to Holmes, he embarks on a determined endeavour to take down his arch-nemesis once and for all. It's hard to explain the plot because some of the main plot points happen for no reason, so it's difficult to even write a proper synopsis. Seriously, things happen at random in this movie. Like within the first 5 minutes the most enraging, lame, and downright stupidest move the writers made happens for almost no reason.All main cast members return from the first film. Robert Downey Jr. is back as Sherlock Holmes, and as before, he's great. He is completely into this role and you believe him. What is really great in this movie is Sherlock vs. Moriarty, and this is really where Robert Downey Jr.'s acting in this movie flourishes. He gets really confident and serious, and you're just thinking 'it's going down'.Jude Law is perfect as Watson. I think I prefer Jude Law's Watson to Martin Freeman's Watson. But the two adaptations are set in different time periods, so I think Jude Law is the perfect Watson for the 1800's, and Martin Freeman is the perfect Watson for the 21'st Century. But Jude Law's Watson is perfect with the smart-ass remarks. He is totally Sherlock's backup and he hates it, but he accepts that and he deals with it, and it makes for some great comedy.Jared Harris is good as Moriarty. His first appearance on the screen, you know that he is in control. He's very calm, very smart, and menacing. The only thing I wish had been different about him is the actor. While Jared Harris is pretty good, I really wanted someone younger than or as old as Sherlock. That would be a great parallel for Holmes to deal with, but instead he's like sixty years old. This really sucks because I loved the Moriarty in the first 'Sherlock Holmes'. He was young, skinny, very threatening, and had this seriously scary voice. But now he's just this normal, heavy-set, old guy.The fights in this movie suck. You may remember in the first 'Sherlock Holmes', a lot of the fighting was hand to hand, and I loved that aspect. In this movie, we get like two fisticuff scenes and then the rest is gunplay. I hated that; don't make the action just generic slow motion bullet fests. That's my main gripe with this movie is it feels like someone wrote an 18th Century action film and just added in Sherlock Holmes at the last minute. I know that's not what happened, but that's what it feels like.The major thing that sucks about the Guy Ritchie movies is that after watching BBC's 'Sherlock' series, everything else seems second place. Everything that is done in the Guy Ritchie films, the BBC series does better, which makes enjoying the Ritchie films difficult because you're constantly comparing to something much better.I will personally not be buying this movie. I'd only get this movie if it was like a $5 movie in the bargain bin. I heard a lot of other people say they liked it, so I'm not saying everyone will hate it, but I did. And isn't that the point of a review, to state your opinion? So I did not like 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows', but you might so at least rent it or borrow it off a buddy. Who knows how you'll feel?",6,0,2,26 June 2012
Lucky Number Slevin," Not At All What You're Expecting, 'Lucky Number Slevin' is a Modern Classic
","'Lucky Number Slevin' is a film I'd only known about in name for years. I'd wanted to see it for years, but because I had no idea what it was about, I never took the time to see it. Besides Bruce Willis being in it, I had no background information to go off of when I rented it.The film is about Slevin, a normal everyday guy who goes to visit his friend Nick Fisher in New York. When Slevin is mistaken for Nick by two rival gangsters, the Boss and the Rabbi, he has a double ultimatum issued: to get $33,000 dollars for the Rabbi, and to kill the Rabbi's son for the Boss. With the help of Nick's neighbour Lindsay, her and Slevin try to figure out what all is happening and how to get Slevin out of his predicaments. That's about as far as I can get into the plot without spoiling the hell out of this movie. Believe me, this is one of those flicks where if I spoiled it, you'd hate me forever.Josh Hartnett plays Slevin. You instantly like this guy. He's a relatable, funny, wise ass, down-on-his-luck guy. Everything he says is either funny or very intelligent. One of my favorite tidbits is when Slevin questions how the Rabbi can be a religious man and a gangster, without conflicting his religion. It's little bits like this that really make you like his character.The rest of the cast is also great. Morgan Freeman plays the Boss. I don't even know what to say, it's Morgan Freeman being awesome, what more do you want? Ben Kingsley plays the Rabbi. I've never been a big fan of Kinsley, especially of late, but I thought he was great in this film. He does the Jewish accent perfectly and it sets him apart from practically every other part he's ever played, where I always think of him as 'that British guy'. As for Lucy Liu, she's kind of just there, but her character is still very likable. When she starts talking Bond trivia, that's when I was in nerd heaven. Seriously, if I ever meet a chick who knows every actor who ever played Ernst Stavro Blofeld, I'll marry her on the spot.'Lucky Number Slevin' is a film that was obviously inspired by Quentin Tarantino's work, mainly 'Pulp Fiction'. It has all the makings of a Tarantino film: complicated, intelligent and fast dialogue used to discuss such simple topics, constant references to classic cinema, non-linearism, and characters overlapping into each other's stories. It's a great formula that I wished was used a bit more often, but I'm glad it's saved for films that really deserve to use it.'Lucky Number Slevin' is a great film. With some Tarantino-esque flare and some great characters, you'll definitely enjoy this, especially if 'Pulp Fiction' is up on your list of 'Best Crime Films Ever', in which case, this movie will probably join that list.",8,3,4,12 May 2012
Sucker Punch," My Mind Just Took A 'Sucker Punch'
","This movie blew my mind. 'Sucker Punch' is, in short, about the delusions within the delusions of a crazy chick. That's pretty much all you need to know. Think of the 'dreams within dreams' case from 'Inception'. Just like that.The plot, well, there barely is one, but in all honesty. I don't care. But for those of you who want a bit more than 'about a crazy chick', here you go. Babydoll kills her sister by accident, and assaults her step-father. He takes her to an asylum, where Babydoll retreats into her mind and imagines it an old 1930's-1940's brothel, so she doesn't have to deal with the pain of being in a psycho prison. Within this 'brothel', a requirement to 'work' there is to dance. But Babydoll doesn't know how to. Her dance instructor, Madame Gorski, tells Babydoll to let her mind go, and somehow, that makes Babydoll imagine she's fighting a 20 foot gorilla-samurai with a chain-gun! It's messed up. So in basic, Babydoll plans to escape the asylum with the help of her friends, but along the way, she has to dance every once and a while, so we get more epic fight scenes. That's the best way I can think of putting the plot. And, I'm sure you're still a bit confused. Don't worry.As for acting, well, again, I don't think it matters. There's decent performances, and Vanessa Hudgens breaks the bond from her 'High School Musical' days and shows she can kick ass! Those are the best words for this film: Kick-Ass. The action is insane, over the top, amazing, beautifully choreographed and most of all, intense. The situations the girls are thrown into are ridiculous. One time, their in a D&D setting with an assault helicopter fighting a giant dragon over an egg. Then they're on a futuristic train trying to stop a bomb whilst killing every NS5 from 'I, Robot' they see.The soundtrack, is surprisingly, amazing. Every action scene is driven by a sick remix of incredible songs, from 'White Rabbit' by Jefferson Airplane, to 'When the Levee Breaks' by Led Zeppelin. It's freaking fantastic.I'll say one thing about 'Sucker Punch'. I saw this with my mother and she LOVED it, and she normally watches a movie once and that's it. She wants to buy this. When you get my mother's approval, you got something good. Hell, my mom said even she noticed the soundtrack and would totally buy it. That is a ground-breaking achievement, and also proving this is not just a guy movie. Though I have to say, a group of girls with names such as Babydoll wearing school girl outfits slicing and dicing will get any guys attention. Don't even bother renting 'Sucker Punch', just buy it.",8,2,3,12 December 2011
Source Code," This Decade's 'Minority Report' is Here...
","When I saw the trailer for 'Source Code', I immediately thought 'this looks like it could be really awesome or really dumb'. I was kind of leaning towards dumb because there aren't many sci-fi thrillers that are good these days. So I held off on renting it. But I finally did because I saw the trailer again and was like, 'you know what, I'm going to watch 'Source Code' finally'. And I'm glad I did.The plot of 'Source Code' involves Captain Colter Stevens (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) being abducted by a government project so he can go back in time into the body of another man to stop a terrorist from blowing up a Chicago train. I have to say, this premise always sounded really cool. Anything involving time travel in any way shape or form is always a good thing. But the cool thing about 'Source Code' is, as it's said in the film, it's not time travel, it's time reassignment. It isn't explained too well and I have a hard enough time trying to think about it as I'm writing this, but when you're watching the film, you understand, and that's really what matters. This isn't a time travel film you should go all sciencey on. It's just meant to give you a basic explanation for how the premise of this movie can even work.Acting is good. Nothing Oscar worthy, but good performances none the less. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good as Colter. He brings a lot of frantic and chaotic energy to the screen. Colter is a very believable character. You sympathize with this guy and you really believe him. It kind of reminds me of Bruce Willis' performance in the original 'Die Hard'. Even though he's in this ridiculous situation, he's still making wise-ass jokes and being smart. It's a really enjoyable performance that really shows how diverse an actor Jake Gyllenhaal really is.Michelle Monaghan plays Christine, Colter's love interest. Her character isn't that developed since we hear a lot of the same facts about her repeatedly, but overall she's a decent character. I didn't think she was there for much, except so that the ending of the film could even happen. But I'll get to that later.I like how small the scale of this movie is. Overall, there are three main sets; the capsule that Colter is stuck in, the headquarters for Source Code, and the train. You get associated with these areas real fast, and it kind of helps to put you in Colter's shoes. You're just seeing the same stuff over and over again. You already know where everything is, what's going to happen and how it will happen, but each trip is a little different.The final half an hour of the film is excellent. This is where Jake Gyllenhaal's acting skills are really spotlighted. He practically has this whole last half hour to show off what he can do. We get to see a cocky Colter, an emotional Colter, and a romantic Colter. We get to see all sides to this character in the span of this hour and a half film, and that's what makes him so believable.The ending is interesting. I'm not going to spoil it but I'll put my feelings out there. I think it was the right move, story wise, but I think it wasn't executed the best. It's still good, but I think the real thing that kills it is the lack of emotion in Jake Gyllenhaal's final narration. Especially because this ending is emotional. Overall, I think 'Source Code' was very enjoyable. While not the most thrilling of movies and definitely not at all action-packed, 'Source Code' will make your mind think. A lot of people might not get it, and a lot might think it was very generic, and I could see why. So I say, at least watch 'Source Code'. You may be surprised.",8,0,1,21 April 2012
Skyfall," A Fantastic Milestone That Takes The Bond Series To Brave New Frontiers and Is Definitely One of the Best of them All
","I was hesitant about getting too excited about 'Skyfall'. I had gotten so hyped over 'Quantum of Solace' before its release, and then been so disappointed, that I tried to ignore the buzz and wait to judge the film for myself. All I hoped was that 'Skyfall' would either match or exceed 'Casino Royale'. I didn't see it opening night and all I heard was that critics loved the hell out of it and that it was being called 'The Best Bond Ever'. Does it deserve that graceful title though? The film opens up with a chase scene. This opening really got mixed feelings from me. The chase was cool but at the same time I think it really lacked the punch that 'Casino Royale' did. But this is where one of the main plot points stems from. Bond is accidentally shot by his fellow agent and is declared dead by MI6. He goes into exile for months and drinks his face off and slums into a pretty pathetic life. But when a bomb attack at MI6 reveals a conspiracy against M, Bond returns to London to protect his mentor and help find whoever is threatening her life. The initial premise of 'Skyfall' is kind of boring, but it works perfectly because the film focuses on the themes that the story involves, and it seems like its natural and not just put in for character development.And character development is one of the movie's strongest points. Daniel Craig returns in his third outing as Bond. For me, Daniel Craig defined the role as 007 in 'Casino Royale', surpassing Sean Connery. He was cold, ruthless, and it took Vesper to show him love and that he could stop his job and live a normal life. When Vesper was killed though, he lost the reason to have that normal life and so went back to being cold and learnt to not trust anyone. I felt in 'Quantum of Solace', nothing new was brought to Bond. However, in 'Skyfall', Bond is taken to new levels that have never before been touched by the series. You can see when he's exiled that he doesn't enjoy it at all and he's living in his equivalent of hell. When you remember how he feels that he lost that chance at a normal life when Vesper died, it really makes sense why he's so unhappy with his existence and longs for his old life in the line of fire. When Bond comes back to MI6 though, he's lost his touch and can't even fire a gun properly. He feels old and out of date, not fitting in with the new world of technology. This is one of the main themes of 'Skyfall'. The whole film circles around Bond trying to reclaim his pride and prove himself again. This type of theme was touched upon in 'Die Another Day', but here it's done with much more style and competence.Javier Bardem plays Silva, the villain. His performance is mesmerizing; anytime he's on screen you can't your eyes off him. His entrance is probably done with the most class of any Bond villains in history. Silva is an ex-MI6 agent who was a favorite of M. However, Silva was captured on a mission in China and left to be tortured. Again, this is another type of theme that was touched on in 'Die Another Day'. After failing to kill himself with a cyanide tooth, Silva swore vengeance on M for leaving him to die. He's probably the best Bond villain in history, other than Ernst Stavro Blofeld. And while he longs to kill M, he still cares for her and is a great parallel to Bond.Judi Dench returns as M. M had been a major character in the previous Craig films, but now she's finally given the spotlight she deserves. M feels responsible for the deaths of all the people who have gotten caught between her and Silva and turns to Bond to help her. Even when Bond fails his service test, she allows him to go and investigate because of the trust she has for him. There's a brilliant unspoken bond between James and M, and it's one of the best things the Craig films have had in them. However, their connection is explored much more in depth in 'Skyfall' and brings them closer together than ever. Typically in Bond films, there's a girl that Bond needs to save and it usually goes that he ends up sleeping with her. The brilliant part in 'Skyfall' is that M ends up being this film's Bond girl, but she breaks the mold so much because instead of being the typical damsel in distress, she's a strong, independent woman who can match Bond's cold heart and ruthless nature. It's less of a cliché 'love' story and more a tale of friendship between mentor and student.Ben Wishaw makes his debut as the new Q, taking over from John Cleese. He and Bond instantly form that close but whimsical relationship all us fans have grown to know and love. Q himself really adds to the theme of Bond feeling out of date. He's young and amazing with technology, clashing with the old-school intelligence and gunplay style Bond reflects. Ben Wishaw's performance is perfect. It's smooth and confident, and he doesn't seem pressured by the shoes he's filling at all. I'm highly looking forward to seeing him in future installments.Overall, I thought 'Skyfall' was amazing. I found the first half a little boring, but all together I thought the film was an amazing way to mark the 50 year mark for the franchise and it finally brought Bond to new levels that I had been waiting to see for years. I would definitely get this film for full price on Blu-Ray. It's worth every dollar and is a milestone for the franchise, and I can't wait to see where they take the series from here.",8,2,13,4 December 2012
G.I. Jane," Good, Enjoyable Entertainment with Demi Moore Showing Off Her Badass Side
","'G.I. Jane' is the story of Lieutenant Jordan O'Neill, a Naval Intelligence officer who gets chosen by a senator to be the test dummy for woman's acceptance into Military Combat. She gets put into training for the Navy SEALS, the most elite and toughest training. Now, O'Neill must prove she has what it takes to be among the best of the boys. Directed by Ridley Scott and co-written by the creator of the 'Chronicles of Riddick' series, I wasn't sure what to expect. Ridley Scott is an amazing director but I didn't like 'Pitch Black' that much, so I didn't know if I ended up liking this movie. But you know what? I highly enjoyed it.Demi Moore plays Lieutenant O'Neill, a tough, no-nonsense girl who just wants to get in on the action. Out of all the roles I've seen Demi Moore in, this is my favourite one yet. She's strong-willed, determined, and as the film goes on, she becomes a giant badass. If there was ever a woman's version of 'The Expendables', Demi Moore would definitely be in it. She's a great character and you really want to see her succeed and kick all the guy's asses. She also gets into the best shape of her life. Even when she shaves her head, forms abs and gets totally ripped, she is still incredibly hot.Viggo Mortensen plays John, the Master Chief. No, not the one from Halo. The moment he steps on screen, you know this guy is hardcore. He's brutal, mean, and is really a dick towards O'Neill. Of course towards the end they become allies but the stuff he does to O'Neill is just terrible. You do not like this guy at all, but that just shows that Viggo Mortensen did a good job as Master Chief. Only way he could be any more badass is with an energy sword.The atmosphere in this movie is awesome. You're watching all these guys and O'Neill go through boot camp and you're just sitting there going 'Yeah, I couldn't do that. That's just gross'. Like there's one part where they have five minutes to eat dinner and do they get fresh food? No. They get the scraps from their lunch. So their eating like half eaten corn and weird goop that been sitting there for half a day. I have to be honest, I wouldn't survive 1 day at that place.The last 20 minutes are my least favourite part of the film. It's kind of like 'Full Metal Jacket' in the way that once they leave bootcamp, the movie goes downhill. But unlike 'Full Metal Jacket', the movie only goes downhill a bit. It was kind of just an excuse to make stuff blow up and have a gunfight but I'm not complaining. Got to say, Demi Moore grenading Iraqis and Aragorn sniping people is pretty cool.Overall, I highly enjoyed 'G.I. Jane'. I thought it was a great entertainment and Demi Moore was excellent. It's a badass military film that shows that girls really can kick ass, and I would watch this any day. Definitely a buy on Blu-Ray.",8,10,16,9 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A Very Enjoyable Superhero Film, But Several Major Things Handled Terribly Detract From It
","'The Amazing Spider-Man' had many people skeptical from day one. A reboot of a franchise that'd only been absent five years, redoing the origin story, and just a way for Sony to keep the rights to the character from reverting back to Marvel. But as more and more news came in about the project, I became more and more hopeful. I was hoping that with the excellence of recent superhero films like 'Iron Man', that 'The Amazing Spider-Man' would join the list of critically-acclaimed and commercially phenomenal adaptations that fans and mainstream audiences would love. Sadly, we got our hopes too high.'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a retelling of the origin story. Peter Parker's parents mysteriously vanished when he was just a boy. Now, Peter is a teenager and while looking into his parents past is bitten by an experimental spider, giving him newfound abilities. Peter also meets Dr. Curt Connors, an ex-partner of Peter's father who is trying to regrow his arm by splicing the DNA of lizards into other animals. When Connors loses his patience, he injects himself with an untested serum and becomes the the Lizard. Now, Peter must stop what he is partially responsible for and become the hero he is destined to be. If I went into every little detail about just the first hour of story in this movie, the whole review could be taken up by just the synopsis. When you're watching the movie though, they go through all of this really fast and it doesn't feel rushed, it's just expertly written.One of the reasons I did not enjoy certain aspects of this movie is first of all, the two main plot lines the marketing for this film pushed to be the molding of Peter Parker into a hero are dropped. After about 45 minutes, Peter stops looking for clues into his parents past. And about 20 minutes after Peter becomes Spider-Man, he stops looking for Uncle Ben's killer. Both of these plot lines have potential for strong emotion and character development, but they're forgotten and hardly mentioned ever again. Just like in 'Spider-Man 3', it feels like there were several sub-plots thought of for this movie, and instead of picking just one, the writers threw them all in. That's not to say that like 'Spider-Man 3', it feels like there's too much going on in this movie. It never feels like there is too much, but just the right amount of other things going on besides just Spider-Man vs. the Lizard. What I mean is that all the sub-plots were used fine, but two of them were just dropped suddenly. And that really bothered me.Now the acting in this film was great. Looking back, I now see how poor a casting choice Toby Maguire was in the Sam Raimi trilogy. I grew up watching the Raimi trilogy, and as a kid I never questioned it. But now looking at Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man in comparison to Toby Maguire's Spider-Man is pointless. They're just completely different. And not just with Spider-Man, but with Peter Parker too. Toby Maguire's Peter Parker was very cliché in that he's ridiculously smart, he's awkward, and he wears nice shirts and glasses. Whereas Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker was very modern. He rides a skateboard, he dresses like a hipster, he wears contacts, but he's deceivingly brilliant. He's just like that quiet smart kid that hardly talks and sits in the back of your class. He's extremely likable and funny and you relate to the guy so much. Everything his character does is what a normal teenager would do if given the powers that Peter has. I could never relate to Maguire's Peter Parker, but now we have Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker, and he is awesome.Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was nothing more than Emma Stone's usual amazing performance. She's very natural, very funny, but can also carry herself emotionally. You can't help but love her character and you care for her. When I love an actress that much, that means that she never lets me down when she portrays a character and I always love that character. Emma Stone does that. That's something that no matter how hard they tried, I couldn't do with Mary Jane in the Raimi films. Whenever she was captured, I just always thought 'well here goes Spidey to save cliché superhero girlfriend #25'. Thankfully, someone else thought that too.Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors was so cliché in my opinion, it was ridiculous. I never felt sorry for his character and I never cared whether he lived or died. He is such a stereotype scientist it drives me insane. The Lizard talks, which I didn't expect. And you could've blamed all his actions up to this point on the Lizard like a Jekyll/Hyde scenario, but once he talks, you realize that Connors is actually in control and has just turned evil for no reason. Towards the end of the movie, his evil plot is to morph the entire city of New York into Lizard people. And you're really wondering how a guy with an insane IQ like Connors thinks that turning everyone into monstrous killing machines will fix humanity. It doesn't make sense to me at all, especially since Connors is in control as the Lizard and he can still utilize his intelligence.You probably think I hate this movie. I didn't at all, actually it was really enjoyable. But I can't help nitpick this movie because I was really excited to see it. Whether or not I'm to blame for setting my expectations too high, or the writers are for not paying attention to certain aspects, I would still buy 'The Amazing Spider-Man' on Blu-Ray for $15 maximum. It's a good movie, and I'm sure on repeated viewings I'd enjoy it a lot more, but as it stands right now, it didn't satisfy what I was looking for.",5,0,3,5 July 2012
Mamma Mia!," This Movie Is Bad. Plain as That
","I'm going to try to keep this as simple as possible. This movie is terrible. It is one of the most gruelling films I've ever had to sit through. You would think a concept such as taking an ABBA-inspired Broadway musical and adapting it to the big screen would be at least decent. But this film is so poorly executed in every scene that you can tell within ten minutes that all your hopes for this movie are gone.So 'Mamma Mia!' is about a young girl named Sophie who is about to get married. However, she doesn't know who her father is, and after reading her mother's diary, she deduces there are three possibilities as to the identity of her dad. So she invites all three to her wedding, much to her mother's displeasure, and now we have our movie. Literally there is no real plot to this film, we get that five minute set up and the rest of the film is just stupidity that ensues, and you know precisely where this is going. Daughter's going to have mixed feelings between 'fathers', the mom is going to fall in love with one of them, and the dads are going to all try to connect with Sophie. You've seen this movie before, just in better quality. It's cheap, cliché, and boring. No one cares.And there's another thing about this movie. I care for absolutely nobody. None of the characters strike my interest, none of them demand attention, and none of them are relatable because they are all acted so poorly. Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried are the only ones I can say actually tried in this film. But everyone else phones in false energy, painful smiles and typically awful singing, in particular Pierce Brosnan. I know the man isn't a stellar actor, but I at least enjoyed him in the Bond films. Here, I want to punch him. His character becomes one of the leads, but honestly he was the 'father' I was least cared about, not to say I had much care for any of them.Now, the singing. I was excited for this movie at the beginning honestly, because I enjoy musicals and ABBA's songs are always enjoyable. Well scratch 'always' because I've found the exception. The pitches, the tones, the ranges, everything about this soundtrack screams for help. Pierce Brosnan has the worst singing voice I've ever heard an actor present on screen. Next time anyone complains about Russell Crowe in 'Les Miserablés', show them this movie and see what they say afterwards.I honestly don't have anything else to say about this film. It's so shallow and unappealing I don't even want to talk about it. Everything is bad. I will never watch this willingly ever again, and if I do by chance have to sit through it with a future girlfriend or something, I think I'll just plug in my iPod and play ABBA's original tracks over the musical numbers. At least that'll add some enjoyment to it.",3,2,3,28 July 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Another New Wes Anderson Classic, But Not As Great As Others
","I've always loved quirky comedies. The genre is so full of generic sex and stoner jokes that to see something off-beat, awkward and with true passion behind it is the most refreshing thing for me. Sadly, for the longest time, I had never heard of Wes Anderson. I don't dive into indie films that often unless it has an actor I love or some other person of personal preference connected to it. It wasn't until 2012's 'Moonrise Kingdom' that I was introduced to the work of the auteur director, and immediately after watching, I blew through his entire filmography and all related works. I found several gems, and some more boring pieces, but overall I was filled with joy over this sub-sub-genre of comedies I had discovered. So I was very much looking forward to Anderson's next directorial effort, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. And my patience was well invested.I want to start off by saying that I think Anderson's masterpiece is 'Moonrise Kingdom', although many say 'Rushmore' or even this now. But to me, the characters in Kingdom were the most developed and relatable out of Anderson's many creations throughout the years. So I went in hoping that 'Grand Budapest' would surpass his previous film and become my new favourite. This is the only part of the film I'm truly disappointed in. I don't think Anderson caught that lightning storm in a bottle he had before. Instead this time, he's caught a single bolt, which is more than enough for a great movie, but it's not as great.'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is the tale of Monsieur Gustave and his lobby-boy Zero whom, while attending the funeral of one of Gustave's many elderly lovers, discover she has been murdered and that she has left her most prized possession (a priceless painting) to Gustave himself. Fearful for their lives, Gustave and Zero steal the painting and run across country to avoid Madame D.'s vengeful son and the authorities in hopes of keeping their fortune and discovering Madame D.'s killer. It's a classic who-dunnit with Anderson's signature twist that makes the film feel very fresh and unique. It definitely stands apart from many of Anderson's previous works, while still keeping many of his trademark themes.Ralph Fiennes headlines the film as Gustave. I've always like Fiennes work, but I always felt like he would never break free of me only being able to see Voldemort when I look at him. But he has finally shattered that mental state with his performance in this film. I will always see Gustave now. Fiennes plays the role with complete confidence and conviction, as if it's a hidden method character he's had boiling in him for years, only to now finally be able to release it onto the screen and give us one of the most interesting and amusing cinematic bachelors in many years. You can never take your eyes off him, and from his mood swings to pointless ramblings he always has an intoxicating affect. You might not understand everything that he's talking about, but you're intrigued regardless.Zero, played by Tony Revolori, is basically Anderson's new Jason Schwartzman. I can see a long and prosperous partnership blooming here. Rightfully so, as Revolori is a great new actor. He has a nice breakthrough here in 'Budapest Hotel', and while the film doesn't let him show off as much of his skills as I wish it did, he still is always a friendly and comforting face to see. Even if it usually stays in that flat, indifferent expression most of the time. Zero is sadly made an observer in the film, not one to take action. Therefore, Relovori isn't given as much to do as he deserves. Regardless, I look forward to seeing him in future Anderson projects and hopefully breaking out on his own.Aside from those two, the film mostly consists of Anderson's more recent recurring actors that he's assembled from his past three of so films. Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe all appear, along with Anderson staples Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson. All these combined create a classic ensemble of whacky and lovable characters who just add more fun and delight to the film. Although I think Harvey Keitel should get a reward for best transformation. It took me a good minute to recognize him.Overall I very much enjoyed 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. I would call it Anderson's third best, behind 'Moonrise Kingdom' and 'Fantastic Mr. Fox'. The characters are very interesting and enjoyable, the plot's entertainingly complex (although not by that much), and Anderson's classic visual style, unique humour, and gorgeous music all combine to make for one of his best films.",8,1,3,16 July 2014
Across the Universe," If You Like The Beatles, Beautiful Visuals, Musicals, or Love Stories, Then This Is A Movie You Must See
","'Across the Universe' is a film I had heard of for years, but had never taken the time to sit down and watch. I knew it was a rock opera with Beatles songs, that it was a love story, and that I heard nothing bad about it. But after about three years of being in limbo on how this movie was, I decided to finally sit down and give it a watch. And I wish I had done so sooner.'Across the Universe' is about Jude, a young man from Liverpool who decides to go to America to find his father. While what he finds is a disappointment, he meets his friend Max and his sister, Lucy, who Jude falls in love with. The three of them move to New York, where they meet Prudence, Satie, and JoJo, and soon they are all swept up in the 1960's world of music, war, and love. You could possibly look at this film and completely label it a hippy throwback, but while you're watching it, the word hippy never comes to mind. It's more of a story of a group of people's self-discovery and the hardships they go through.There are no big-name actors in this film, at all. It's all unknowns. I love it when big films give young actors a chance to shine, and with this film, it'll probably be the roles they're all remembered for. Jim Sturgess plays Jude. He looks like he came right out of 1960's England. If you could go back in time and put him into the Beatles, you wouldn't know a difference at all. He was the perfect person to play Jude. Not just for looks, but for his performance too. He's instantly likable, you just look at him and grin because you probably know a guy exactly like him.Evan Rachel Wood plays Lucy. She gives a good performance, and Lucy's a likable character. She's obviously a polar opposite to Jude, so it gives them a good character dynamic, but honestly, the exact same kind of dynamic was in 'Grease', so it gives it a bit of a recycled feel, especially for a musical.Visually, this film will trip you out to no end. In several of the musical numbers, you'll just be wondering, 'who the hell just turned the psychedelic switch to 11'? It'll be a perfectly normal scene, and then it's like you just dived head first into an acid trip. Some of the scenes are disturbing and a bit off putting, like 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)', but there are others that are really beautiful like 'Dear Prudence'. It's a mixed bag, but you can't deny, it's a gorgeous film to look at.The songs in this film are all used to perfect effect. You'll realize it later, because you won't be able to listen to the Beatles afterwards and not think of the scenes in the film that go along with the film. Now usually, I'm completely against covers in films, but several of the songs used in the film I think are better in certain ways. 'Something' is the one I think is probably used to the best effect. It seems like the song is sung in the exact situation the Beatles imagined when they wrote the song. It works so beautifully, that you might find that the original version doesn't work as good if you visualize it being played to the scene.The other musical numbers that really stand out to me in this movie are 'With A Little Help from My Friends', 'Hey Jude', and 'All You Need is Love', which epitomizes everything the film builds up towards. Don't be surprised to find yourself singing along to these songs. Throughout the film, you've grown to love these characters, and these songs lift you up and warm your heart in a way that not a lot of films these days can do.In conclusion, 'Across the Universe' is a great film. It seems the team behind this film were able to find a story that after viewing this film, you feel like it wasn't forced, but more like it was there all along. And now that you've seen it unfold, you'll never be able to forget it.",7,0,0,12 May 2012
22 Jump Street," Definitely Not As Good As The First, But Still Holds Strong
","Comedies are a genre I'm scarcely impressed by. Unless the humour is highly quirky or the film is deliberately offbeat, I typically don't like them. So from someone like Jonah Hill, (who I had come to expect just mainly sex jokes from after 'Superbad'), I was really surprised to discover he wrote '21 Jump Street'. Was I impressed that he basically took (what I guess was, at least) one of his favourite shows from when he was a kid and pointlessly slapping the name on a new undercover cop movie? No. But the fact he was smart enough to address that and that he was actually capable of writing clever humour and completely emotionally developed characters, in the end won me to over to end up loving 2011's '21 Jump Street' and accepting it as one of my favourite comedy film in the past few years. However the immediate set-up for a sequel really dismayed me because I was worried it would become a classic case of 'rinse and repeat' sequel syndrome. And in that, I was pretty much spot on.So '22 Jump Street' takes place only a few months or so after its predecessor in that after being off Jump Street for a while, officers Jenko and Schmidt are re-assigned back to undercover work because they did it so well in their first case. So now they're sent off to college to do the exact same thing as the first film. And the thing that forgives most of the film for this is that the writers were clearly aware of this so they made full well the audience got the message that 'Yes, we know this is the same as the first movie. Don't bash us for it, its part of the joke. Go along with it'. But in that, at the same time, the movie also feels highly rehashed and you can't help but go 'This is the exact same'. I got sick of it towards the end, I just wanted something new. And a movie, especially a sequel should not make me do that.The other thing I want to address in this movie is that surprisingly I still laughed at this movie just as hard, and definitely harder in one scene, as I did in '21 Jump Street'. The comedy is still there, and it's still just as good. So don't think that because the movie feels rehashed that you're not going to laugh because yes you definitely are, regardless.Now while the first 'Jump Street' had some fairly recognizable supporting cast members like Dave Franco and Brie Larson, I have to say this movie's supporting cast was way more unknown. I thought I recognized Jonah Hill's new love interest but clearly she just looks like someone else because she has been no one with real screen time from anything I've seen on her filmography. So it seems like they had to use the budget they would have used on some bigger names, and instead used it to keep up with the cost for all the action scenes. It's just wasted potential, to me and that is a big disappointment.The acting itself in the movie is very good. There's only three people to care about this time since there's no real supportive cast. Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and surprisingly Ice Cube. I wasn't a huge fan of him in the first film (or any movie he's ever been in), so I'm surprised how much I enjoyed him this time around. But first off, I have to talk about our main duo. Tatum and Hill are a great duo because they have a chemistry locked down that so many films try to copy. It's funny to me because I would have never though that a G.I. Joe and that kid from 'Superbad' would one day be hilarious as hell together in an action- comedy, yet here we are. They bounce off each other really well, and I'm certain there's plenty of times where their lines are improv and it's completely seamless. They're great together and I hope they do another series or something after the Jump Street movies because they are so brilliant as a duo.Now Ice Cube was one of the biggest surprises to me in this film because I have never like him as an actor. He played up the angry black captain stereotype in the first film and it did alright for him. But what I realize now is that I didn't care because he just started off angry and never had motive. In this film they give him reason to be the angry black captain and that pushes into hilarity. Now I love his character and would watch a whole movie with him. It's just a good example how character development does add to an audience's enjoyment with a film.The last thing I think I can say is that the action in this movie is bigger than the last one, and overall better. There are more jokes while the fights are happening and it's all actual realistic conversations I've imagined real people would have if they got into that sort of fight, for example. There's one which makes fun of a really old cliché really well and it was one of the funniest scenes of the whole movie, that's all I'm going to say.So in the end, was '22 Jump Street' enjoyable? Yes. Was it better than the first? No. Was it a rehash? Definitely. But it did redeem itself a little bit by acknowledging that fact, even the joke got old quick. I'm still going to buy this movie, it's still super entertaining to me. It's best watched with a bunch of friends, like all comedies are. After this I think the inevitable 23 Jump Street could turn out at least good. Let's just hope it'll be more original.",8,3,9,16 July 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not One of the Best Superhero Flicks Ever, But Cheesy Fun
","So when I was a kid, I went through multiple phases of who my favorite super hero was. For quite a bit of time, it was a shared spot by all members of The Fantastic 4. When I saw the first movie, I thought it was awesome. And then in the middle of my FF phase, 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer' came out. But what I got, wasn't quite what I had expected.Set about a year or two after the previous film, Reed Richards and Susan Storm are about to be married. But on their big day, things take a turn for the worst as a mysterious being shows up who is digging giant holes in the planet to the earth's core. The U.S. army task the Fantastic 4 with stopping the Silver Surfer before he destroys the planet. At the same time, Victor Von Doom, aka Doctor Doom, has been resurrected and after encountering the Surfer, goes to the army to help Reed, Johnny, Ben, and Susan stop the Surfer. It is revealed that the Surfer is actually a herald for a greater threat, known as Galactus, an entity that devours planets for energy. Victor steals the Surfer's board and now the Fantastic Four have to save the world from the combined threat of Doctor Doom and Galactus before either one control the planet.As far as acting goes, superhero movies from the 80's to the late 2000's are pretty generic with their acting skills. There are exceptions like Christopher Nolan's Batman films and Bryan Singer's X-Men films, but for the majority of it, the acting is never something the films thrive on. 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is one of those movies. The performances are bland and as good-evil as Hollywood gets. The only one in these films who I think played their character to a T is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. He embodies the Human Torch much more than Captain America in my opinion.The action in this film is pretty good for as far as super hero films used to go. With one's like 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Avengers' these days, where the action is really insane or thrilling, it's amazing. But in the 2000's, anyone will remember that nothing really mind blowing happened in super hero films until 2008. For a summer popcorn flick, 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' has good action. The problem is it's done all too fast and feels really rushed. I don't think there's a better example than the fight in the forest with the Silver Surfer. When Surf is flying around and smacking missiles away like they're nothing, that was awesome. But it all ends in like one minute when Susan turns on some device and it's like 'Well, that was short'.For one thing, I always thought bringing back Doctor Doom was a stupid move by the writers. They should have stuck with it like the 'Spider-Man' films. Kill the villain, he's done for good. But in a logic defying move, Fox somehow bribed Julian McMahon to come back. This is my least favorite part of this film. I though Victor was a good villain in the first 'Fantastic Four', but here, he takes a back seat so the Surfer can have the spotlight. Understandably, but still, it feels like Doom was added last minute just so they had an excuse to bring back a familiar face. It certainly feels that way with his relevance in the film. When Victor once again becomes Doctor Doom, he has a dumb new silver cape, which I always though looked stupid. I mean, it's always been green. Don't mess with tradition.Now the whole movie, Johnny's powers have been in flux. After the Surfer attacked him, Johnny can temporarily trade powers with the other members of the team. But when the final fight happens with Doom, it's not the Fantastic Four teaming up. Instead, Johnny goes solo absorbing all the Four's powers and just beats the crap out of Doom. Then Ben takes a crane and home-runs Doom into the ocean and they act like everything's fine. He survived being burned and flash frozen; you don't think he could survive taking a swim? It was obvious that the writers were suggesting that Doom would return in a third Fantastic Four film, but I'm glad that never happened.Honestly, the Silver Surfer sucks in the movie. Aside from the Surfer's powers,there's nothing really cool about him. He's a cardboard cut-out of a character. In the finale of the film, the Surfer sacrifices himself to destroy Galactus. That's right, the Fantastic Four don't stop Galactus, the Surfer blows himself up using the board's power. I think this was a really cheap move by the writers. It's like, instead of really thinking of a cool way for the Four to even fight Galactus, they took the lazy way out and were like 'Well how about the Surfer stops him?' and they slacked their way from there.My final gripe about this film. Galactus. Anyone who has read the comics, or played Marvel Ultimate Alliance knows who Galactus is, what he looks like, and how unstoppable he is. Instead of the purple colossus of doom that Galactus has always been, the writers turned him into a space cloud. It looks like something out of a Roland Emmerich film, not an intergalactic super-villain.I know I've gone on a long bitch-fest about this flick and you probably think I hate it. Well, you're half right. I used to hate it, but after re-watching it the other night I found myself highly enjoying it. Despite the things I hate about it, I found that it's very good, cheesy fun.",Null,2,3,1 May 2012
Limitless," 'Limitless' Has It's Limits, But Not Many
","This film really caught my attention. 'Limitless' is the story of Eddie, a writer who is lazy, just got dumped by his girlfriend, and almost broke. When his ex-wife's brother see's him, he decides to use Eddie as a guinea pig for a new drug called NZT, which enhances brain capacity to 100%. Instantly addicted, Eddie gains a whole new life perspective and goes on a self-improvement spree, if you will.Due to his new brain power, he can memorize everything and for what he wants to do, he needs serious money, so he starts by analyzing the stock market and becomes the biggest expert broker in New York. But after a while in the limelight, he has no more NZT, so he starts doing desperate things to get some. He makes enemies with a Russian loan shark who steals a pill of NZT, not knowing what it is, and now forces Eddie to give him more.As Eddie goes through his new life, he gets his girlfriend back, but soon, negative effects from the NZT such as black outs wear him down. Now Eddie has to find a way to keep his new life together so he doesn't have to go back to being a bum.The film is more of a thriller than anything. Little action, a bit of humour, but it's like 'Doctor Who' humour, with him being so smart he out-thinks everyone and makes them look like idiots.There are no effects what so ever. But there is some action. There's a part where the Russian's gang breaks into Eddies house looking for NZT. There's a shoot-out, and to see Eddie's mind racing is great fun.There's another fight scene that was kinda unnecessary but it's cool nonetheless. After a blackout caused by the NZT, Eddie's inside the subway, and he bumps into some gang member. The gang huddles around and goes to beat him up, but by remembering moves in Bruce Lee movies and instructional self defence video's, he learns how to fight in seconds. He beats the hell out of the gang members, but it doesn't look like he's a pro fighter. It looks like what it's supposed to be: he's copying. Analyze and Interpret.The end has to be addressed cause it's where the film falls. After one point, it pull's a Season 2 'Battlestar Galactica' finale and skips ahead a year. Now Eddie is running for the Mayor's office, his book is out, and he's happy as can be.Van Loon shows up and reveals he knew Eddie was taking NZT and threatens that Eddie's drug labs just got shut down, but Eddie's become so smart by this point, he knows they haven't been.Eddie reveals to having fine tuned the NZT formula, and knows that Van Loon's company is in the toilet, so any threats are pointless. I was expecting some last action scene, but it's just verbal confrontation. Van Loon drives away after being totally burned, and Eddie goes to meet his girlfriend for lunch. They sit down at a restaurant, he speaks a foreign language to an Asian waiter, and then just says 'What?' to his girlfriend after she stares at him. And then the movie just ends. Like seriously? That's it? No final shoot-out? Nothing? Just 'What'? It's such a bad ending that it leaves you feeling unsatisfied.The film is good. Mind you, it has flaws, but to see this bum writer go from Hobo to God is a highly interesting concept. Everything he does have consequences, and hearing his voice-overs, hearing his thoughts and how he deals with all this, is the most interesting part, I believe. Make a sequel to this. I wanna see more stuff you can do with this magic brain pill.Anyway, I recommend this to anyone who likes interesting plots and mind-bends. If you're looking for an action movie, it'll satisfy you a little, but not as much as if you watched, say 'Rambo'. Good film, terrible ending.",8,0,1,12 December 2011
Scream," You May Not Scream, But You Will Grin
","In the 90's, the slasher genre was worn out. Series like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' had gravitated away from their horror routes and were now like comedies. The longevity of these series were now a running joke to the audience, and the genre needed some new life. So 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' director Wes Craven decided to make 'Scream'.'Scream' is a horror movie that is self aware. While most films in the genre are usually mocked for being so cliché, 'Scream' celebrates it and cleverly follows the classic formula.The beginning of 'Scream' opens up with Drew Barrymore. Many people thought that, due to the marketing campaign, she was going to be the lead role, since she was such a big name at the time. But, no, she's actually killed within 15 minutes. It's kind of a tribute to 'Psycho', where Janet Leigh was portrayed to be the main hero, but was abruptly killed early.So then, the film transitions over to Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell. Sidney's mother was raped and killed a year prior to the film, and as such, Sidney is in a depression. I find Capmbell's performance to be very solid for a horror film, and this is my favourite role she's been in. This is the film that launched her career. She may have a respectable resume these days, but in my heart, shes a scream queen.Sidney has a boyfriend named Billy, played by Skeet Ulrich. Neve Campbell had co-starred with him earlier that year in 'The Craft'. In his very first scene, Billy sneaks into Sidney's room just to make-out with her. But the way he proposes it is funny as hell. Funny enough, this is probably the way I would propose it if I had a girlfriend.Then there's Sidney's best friend, Tatum, played by a young Rose McGowan. Funny to think that in 11 years, this chick would be blowing the hell out of zombies with a gun-leg in 'Planet Terror'.Tatum's older brother, Dewey, is played by David Arquette, who is the real life older brother of Patricia Arquette. Patricia had starred in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors'. Dewey is an easily lovable character. He comes off as kinda wimpy and weak, but you just love him.Then there's Gale Weathers, played by Courtney Cox. Gale's a news reporter, but she also becomes Dewey's love interest. While the sequels expanded upon this, in the original, it seems like Gale is just using Dewey to get to Sidney for her next big story. Sidney gets so mad at Gale that she punches her square in the face. I laugh my head off every time I see this part.But the man who steals the whole film is Randy, played by Jamie Kennedy. Randy is a film buff, always overflowing with film references and great humour. Randy is probably my favourite film character of all time. Mostly cause I can relate to him. Being a film buff myself, I know the mindset, and thats my favourite part about Randy. He's always in movie-mode.The finale is a 40 minute long build up, sprinkled with a kill here and there, and it keeps you guessing at who the killer really is. Speaking of which, I haven't even talked about the killer yet.The killer's costume was an actual real life Halloween costume that was already popular before the movie. It's kinda like the original 'Halloween', where the filmmakers went out, just bought a random mask from the store, and used it for the movie. Reusing this technique was very smart in my opinion, cause it truly gives the feeling that the killer could be anyone.Overall, I love this movie. While it's in no way a masterpiece of horror cinema, the modern age owes a lot to 'Scream'. It revitalized the slasher genre and brought a new audience's attention back to the classics. It's not a landmark, but it's a pretty solid horror film. Check it out.",7,5,6,5 January 2012
X-Men: First Class," The Best 'X-Men' Film Yet... Even Though the Timeline is Now Forever Messed
","'X-Men: First Class' is the origin story of the amazing team of mutants. That's pretty much all you need to know. This film is what superhero films SHOULD ALWAYS be.Let's start with the characters. James McAvoy plays a much younger, less bald Xavier. He's womanizing, funny as hell, but also very wise and a great leader. It's only becomes a Patrick Stewart like performance when he's guiding the younger X-Men.Michael Fassbender is the new and, I dare say, IMPROVED Erik Lensherr; the man who would become Magento. His performance is natural, amazing, dark, sensitive and relatable. Being tortured by Nazi's as a boy has taken it's toll on him, as he's spent most of his years hunting the Germans involved at the camp he was at so he can get revenge on a man named Schmit; the Nazi who killed Erik's mother.Erik's philosophizing about acceptance and human nature's natural resentfulness towards mutants is great. His voice is dark, his tone is proper, and his face emphasizes his emotions. You can't help but agree with him. I mean, honestly, he's not truly a villain (well, not until the other films start), but in this film, he's just honest. You can't blame him for his thinking, which he actually proves to Charles within the film.Jennifer Lawrence plays Mystique, this film's third main character. She's been in a brother-sister relationship with Xavier since childhood. She's somewhat insecure and scared, but she's also very sensitive and relatable. When she and Erik begin their relationship, Magneto rubs his message onto her and she stops disguising herself as a human and permanently reverts to her blue skin as her public appearance.Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Shaw, a.k.a. Schmidt, the Nazi who killed Erik's mother. He's a mutant that can absorb anything to become more powerful. Not too much to say here, but he's a decent villain.The great thing I think critics are loving about this movie is it revolves around the characters. The writers made them understandable, relatable and lovable. Something most characters in the earlier films failed to do. The performances really drive the film. I don't classify it as a action movie. I think of it as a superhero drama (with action). The action isn't just for entertainment purposes. It adds to the story, and in the middle of it, there's always something else happening that makes it more involved.Basically, this is no 'Dark Knight', but it's definitely the best X-Men film yet, and I think it's about to lead the franchise into a new and bold direction, giving it new life. The characters and story matter, and action should be there to move the plot along, not just to waste 2 million dollars for FX shots and a cheap excitement. THATS what superhero films should be. And 'X-Men: First Class' has definitely hid that nail on the head with the hammer. HARD.This is a great film. A strong recommendation for anyone, even if you don't like 'X-Men'. And since this is the first in a new planned trilogy, you can expect more greatness. Long live the X-Men.",8,0,1,12 December 2011
Rear Window," One of the Most Intriguing, Unique, and Well Done Murder-Mysteries Ever
","'Rear Window' is a film I had heard of for a long time. It seemed that life kept pressing me to see this movie. I'd see a poster for this film in the bedrooms of main characters in many other films, just pushing that I had to see it. I saw the semi-remake 'Disturbia' first and really enjoyed it, but was concerned that I may not like the original because I may just compare it to the Shia LaBeouf version. And finally by luck, I found a copy, so I rented it. And now I see why it's held as such a masterpiece.I can honestly say, from the second I threw on 'Rear Window', I completely forgot about 'Disturbia''s existence. The plots are the same in about two aspects, everything else is completely changed. 'Rear Window' is about Jeffery, who has been confined to a wheelchair for the past several weeks in his apartment. Because of this, he passes his time by watching his neighbours out his window. And after observing a married couple through many fights and the sudden disappearance, Jeffery becomes convinced that the husband murdered his wife. Now, Jeffery must the authority of the crime before the husband can disappear without consequence. It's a very unique premise in which the villain is completely unaware of the hero, with there being no previous personal or political conflict between them, but simply a series of observations that has brought them against each other.The acting in this film is great. Jimmy Stewart leads the film as Jeffery. He is the everyday common man. You believe this guy completely and his performance never seems forced or written. It feels 100% natural and he pulls it off with such class. It's the little things in his character that make him relatable. Like him staring at his hot neighbour despite having a beautiful girlfriend, and making judgements and nicknames for his neighbours who he's never talked to. These little character traits make him likable to everyone and make you care for him.Grace Kelly plays Lisa, Jeffery's girlfriend. She and Jeffery are polar opposites. Jeffery considers Lisa to be too perfect for him and is into adventure, while she likes shopping and fashion. They're on the verge of breaking up, but as she helps Jeffery try to solve this mystery, her adventurous side comes out and they wind up closer than ever. Funny how that always seems to happen it movies, isn't it? She doesn't seem as natural as Jimmy Stewart, but that doesn't mean she's bad. She still does a good job, and it's fun to watch her go from buying dresses and eating expensive meals to breaking into houses and solving this crime.No one can talk about this film without mentioning the camera-work. This movie is filled with wonderful cinematography. Long, panning shots across Jeffery's neighbourhood that show all the neighbours activities makes you feel like it's actually full of people, and not just a bunch of shots of small sets cut together to give the illusion of scope. The set was designed in a brilliant way. It's a relatively small set, with all the houses being in apartments connected to each other, and the neighbours always interacting in one way or another. We get familiar with these neighbours quickly, with all them having nicknames based on their personalities and activities.The last thing I have to say about this movie is the finale. It's no wonder there's a last conflict between Jeffery and the killer. The killer breaks into Jeffery's apartment and is walking up to Jeffery, when Jeffery blinds the killer with a camera flash multiple times. And every time, the killer stops dead in his tracks, takes a second to adjust his eyes back, and takes another step or two and gets blinded. The idiot doesn't even cover his eyes after the second time, he just keeps looking straight into the flash like a dumbass. This really undermines how threatening the villain is, in my opinion, when he's too stupid to cover his damn eyes.Overall though, 'Rear Window' is a brilliantly paced, shot, edited, acted, directed and just really well-done film. But I could easily see modern viewers being turned off by its age and its very different concept. Regardless, I highly recommend giving it a watch.",9,1,3,30 July 2012
