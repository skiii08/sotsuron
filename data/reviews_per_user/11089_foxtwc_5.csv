Hereditary," Bad
","I seriously hated the ending of this movie.The pacing was slow.The plot kept chasing different concepts which ended up being a waste of time by the end.Literally was not scared at all. Even laughed at some things which were not meant to be funny.It's not marketed right, let people know it's satanic/occult in nature not horror.",1,37,80,11 June 2018
Hereditary," Not horror ... satanic worship movie
","I went to the movie expecting it to be a horror movie based on the hype.What I saw was a purposefully misleading plot that refused to reveal what it was about until the final chapter of the movie.I am not even going to waste time trying to explain the overall plot of the movie but will just cut to the chase and say it is a satanic cult that is sacrificing a kid to be the vessel for a demon.Had I known that was the plot of the movie I never would have gone.It wasn't scary, it wasn't a good movie, it doesn't even make you feel like it was well executed. Literally as the plot unfolds you think the movie is exploring one aspect of humanity but then it changes course and does something else entirely until you are left with a tangled web of crap at the end which shows that it was all satanic in the end. So only 1 star for lying to me about this movie being scary, for trying to make satanic cults mainstream entertainment, for a stupid plot, and for one dimensional characters who no one even cared about",1,2,6,20 September 2018
Captain Marvel," Ok but shallow
",I wish media would stop showing stereotypical male chauvinistic behaviour in shows hoping that it will prove that men are putting down women. That part of the movie really made me roll my eyes because it is so disrespectful to men. Why can't they show a great dad in these movies? And too many great men died in the service to serve their country for me to appreciate the knock against men in uniform. It's obvious this was an angle chosen by female direction.That being said it's an action movie ... not a moving piece of cultural history.The montage of carol standing up after being knocked down over and over ... welcome to everybodies life. Getting over fear of failure and being told you can't ... everyone has that in their life.Carol herself ... I couldn't really find her depth. She didn't seem comfortable with the role. And her stance when she attained her confidence in herself just didn't seem natural. Maybe it's the actress?I wonder if Margot Robbie could have put more life into the role? It's too bad she got cast into DCIt's not a horrible movie ... a long the lines of the first Thor movie for a comparable.The flerken part is one of the funniest things I ever saw. And seeing how fury lost his eye was one of those unexpected moments ... I was wishing I heard rocket laughing his arse off,5,2,5,17 March 2019
Aquaman," Good action movie
","Let's face it, most super hero movies are cheesy and consist of action sequences. This no real exception but it is entertaining.I know nothing about aquaman from the comics so I cannot say how true to the canon it is. What I will say is it's not a dark film like the rest of the DC movies.I have no idea what aquamans super powers are ... some things just don't seem to hurt him. And yet he desperately tries not to fall or get hit .... which makes no sense since some kinetic impacts are truly devastating looking ... but then he can't take a punch from a human.But let's not poke holes in the plot. Just enjoy it for what it is ... a popcorn movie with Nicole Kidman who still looks amazing and Amber Heard who would make most men want to be a merman with lots of action",7,1,2,20 January 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Flat and not factual
","This film is incredibly over rated. It should only be sold as a based on real events tag line because it literally Hollywoodizes true events to make it look like the finding of bin laden is due to the efforts of one person. It's an insult that the script writers decided to take such liberties with real world events to concoct a false story wrapped around real terrorist attacks and then market it like this is a factual depiction of the hunt.Boring script, shallow characters, one dimensional portrayal of Muslims.At least Mark Bowden researched events from both sides when he wrote Black hawk down. The book was as factual as he could make it and he did all the leg work to verify events and what people said. The film by Ridley Scott took some liberty to reduce the number of characters in the film but did not go so far to warp the work of Mark to the point the story was two dimensional or disrespectful to everyone involved.I am done with this director. Hurt locker was a fail and so was this film. She should stop profiting off of real life dead soldiers and just make cheesy B rated action films.",3,5,11,23 January 2013
