Alien 3," A Fascinating Failure
","David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club) manages to sow a nearly nonexistent sow's ear into a silk purse on this one.  The film was made without the benefit of a concrete script, yet is brought out of the doldrums thanks to Fincher's expert direction, and the amazing cast which was assembled for the production including Charles S. Dutton, Charles Dance, Danny Webb, Paul McGann, and of course Sigourney Weaver.If possible, check out the longer extended version available as part of the recent Alien Quadrilogy boxed set.  It adds multiple new dimensions to what has, over time, become my favorite film in the series.",Null,0,3,1 January 2004
