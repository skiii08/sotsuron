The Avengers," All together now
","Bringing in Joss Whedon to direct and write Avengers Assemble fitted perfect, considering his history of tackling many characters within hundred and twenty or so minutes. After all he was director/writer of Buffy the vampire slayer. Never before has their been a superhero team up to this magnitude on the big screen. With a good sense of humour and someone who doesn't take superhero mesh ups too seriously Whedon gets the tone spot on! Loki played by Tom Hiddleton is entertaining once more. Vastly entertaining and cunning he is more than a match for our team of heroes. This film introduces the characters and builds them up into team work few the vehicle of Nick Furys shield. Each actor feels made for the part, big Sam is the epitome of Nick Fury. Robert Downey Jr reprises his role as Tony Stark like only he can and Scarlett Johanson is back a Black Widow. Each character is in their own world when founded to join shield. Captain American aka Chris Evans is trying to adapt to the modern world. Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo now taking over from Edward Norton, is still trying to remain safe without incidents. Iron Man is feeling uninitiated and unwanted from the shield and Thor played by Chris Hemworth is on earth to retrieve his brother. Loki retrieves the tesseract a power source energy and encounters the other, an extraterrestrial, whom in exchange will give him an army. This isn't the most indepth story but is lighthearted and never dull. Each character has different strengths which make them likeable and full engaging to watch. The visual effects are stunning and in world of their own and with a strong antagonist this film has soul and purpose in the comic book world.",9,0,0,15 November 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Sulk on the run
","Bruce Banner is a man on the run in this one starting with the nice location of Brazil. This film isn't bad, but doesn't have the strongest of plots compared with other comic book films. Edward Norton does a worthy Job of Bruce Banner and his love interest Betty Ross Liv Tyler shows nice chemistry. You feel the emotional depth of seperation and loneliness for Bruce. You can empathise with his loneliness and issues of contamination due to the gamma radiation as he is hunted down by general thunderbolt Ross. Bruce Banner is harmless, intelligent, reserved and condemned from society to an extent worried about anger and rage and how to prevent this. His only friend at first is online in the name of Mr Blue. Somebody he has never even met. The imprint of what modern society has become in some cases of today world. He goes about a general warehouse job in isolation trying to keep what's inside at bay. Tim Roth plays one of the army soldiers trying to take out the Hulk and ultimately becomes the Abomination. We can see the transformation in Tim Roth as he manages what's inside and the inevitability of it taking over. Although even before, he had a taste for destruction. Emulating parts of the King Kong story and how the general refuses to see anything but a monster inside the Hulk. General thunderbolt Ross has an obsession with weaponising the gamma radiation incident by injecting it out of Banner. Only his daughter can see more to the Hulk and who he truly is inside, Bruce Banner. But her father believes she is blinded by love and not thinking clear.",6,0,0,30 October 2019
Iron Man 3," Any old iron
","Iron man is back and has moments of greatness and elements of surprise but did it all work swimmingly. Well in my opinion it rusted ever so slightly. The main problem with this film is the villain for me. The motive is good but the execution not so much. Jealously can be a dangerous thing and arrogance can set it off. But for me the previous instalments had stronger character development for our main antagonist. Maybe the twist gave the main villain much less screen time than we were prepared to accept. The main villain is a terrorist in the name of the Manderin or so we are lead to believe. But not everything is what it seems. Tony Stark does some crazy stuff for an intelligent man and is easily sent over the edge when his friend Happy is injured. Although there isn't a great deal of character development on their friendship. One big flaw for me is the simplicity in which the manderin is offered Mr Starks home address on the entire news. Now we know from previous instalments Tony can be his own worst enemy, at times egotistical, but seriously this is ridiculous. Does Tony not consider the danger he is not only putting himself in but his girlfriend Pepper. Being the third instalment like most third parts the exaggeration and humour has stepped it up a few levels and of course so has the explosions. Robert Downey Jr maintains his believable flirtatious chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper but also begins ascending new friendships in the unlikely nerdy boy in basement type or garage to be accurate. More of a distraction or annoyance than a friend but a healthy one to remove him from his PTSD after the events of the Avengers alien invasion. Downey Jr shows great emotional depth and along with humour/witty intellect he brings stress and anxiety to a much more round less invincible Tony. He proves that he is much more than just iron man. At times a mentor/father figure to the boy that he treats only like an adult. Juxtaposed along with how his father may well have treated him judging from flashes we have seen of Howard Stark throughout the marvel cinematic universe. Pepper is no longer the damsel in distress in this one but a influential team player and a worthy ally and partner for Stark. Guy Pearce is good in his role as the envious Aldrich Killian but we don't seem to get enough of him as we'd like. Overall it's a solid sequel but nothing groundbreaking in the comic book movie world. More of a story or revenge and how our hero will adapt against the odds.",7,0,0,28 November 2019
Iron Man 2," Stark with a spark
","With Starks alter ego Iron Mans status well and truly established on the world, a new terror is rising in Ivan Vanko. Mickey Rourke plays the cold hearted Vanko, distant, undisturbed and focused on nothing but his mission. The mission to avenge his father and pay a dept he believes the Stark family owe. Much like the first movie the light hearted charm remains in Stark and Pepper. Iron Man 2 is a rollercoaster ride. Stark is unwilling to give up his technology and weapons now the world knows he is Iron Man and arrogant in his beliefs that the rest of the world is nowhere near in designing a battle suit close to his. Expert research must have been made because because Robert Downey Jr is the personification of Stark and Iron Man. Each character has been perfectly cast for this movie. Mickey Rourke is excellent as the Russian hell bent on revenge a vendetta that goes back to his father being exiled from stark industries. Don Cheadle is now playing Rhodes and although I prefer Terrace Howard in this role Don Cheadle is worthy of the part as war machine. Reluctant to dulvage the secrets of his technology Stark is boastful and makes more enemies in fellow business man Justin Hammer. Overall the film is similar to the first and doesn't really bring nothing new to the table, but I'd say Rourke has more screen time than Jeff Bridges had in the first film and made for a more compelling villain. The effects and locations make for an all round well thought out movie and although the story has no real twist it has enough to keep viewers watching.",8,1,1,1 November 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Right on Cap
","The story of Steve Roger is unprecedented in cinema until now. Unlike most comic book movies this film is set in the 1940s. Rogers is your everyday nice but skinny weak looking guy who cares about others. A man who would be seen as the last you'd send into battle, but maybe...just maybe, the man with the biggest heard. Chris Evans is a splendid choice as our protagonist Captain America, and the scene where he dives over the grenade makes you feel another level of emotion. Picked to become a super soldier for his uniqueness, intellect and heart, Steve Rogers must lead soldiers into war to stop his ultimate nemesis Schmidt aka the red skull. With the side story of Rogers and Agent Carter slowly falling for each other. Both willing to wait for the right partner. Carter and Rogers must first get through a threat maybe even worse than Hitler himself. Hayley Atwell provides a strong independent woman in Carter and has depths of emotion towards the end. Rogers is rejected from doing his part in the army to begin with for being to small in stature. Tommy Lee Jones character Chester Philips had little faith in Rogers and is mainly standard Tommy Lee probably slightly under used as this character. The red skull is very caricatured and typical of what you expect a comic villain set in World War Two to be. Admittedly Hugo Weaving doesn't really stand out as an amazing charismatic villain or even as of much threat as he could have. Overall the setting are well related to the time and the Visual effects and stunts are fantastic like most marvel films. The props work well with the CGI and this one is overly flooded with computer visuals.",7,0,0,2 November 2019
Justice League," Kid friendly superheroes
","Justice League comes together and certainly doesn't feel free in it's creativity as far a story arcs are concerned. Where the restrictions come from is anyone's guess. Maybe it was due to Snyder being unable to complete shooting due to personal circumstances. Maybe it's the Hollywood comic book formula in trying to get all these stories to coincide with each other without some main characters even having their solo outing first. Where this film suffers most is lack of story development and a extremely weak villain in Steppenwolf. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it's basically a linear one dimensional storyline where Steppenwolf is in danger of taking over the planet using the energy he collects three motherboxes. These boxes have been hidden for centuries to keep out of the wrong hands. Meanwhile Bruce is assembling a team to stop him on a suspicion the end is looming. The actors do their best but they can't save a weak plot. Gal Godot reprising her role as wonder woman is solid and Ezra Miller brings the humour. But the tone of the film is all over the place. Something tells me Snyder's version will be a lot darker than what Whedon finished off. It's evident that this film was completed by two different men with very different visions. Whedons comedic light-hearted tone juxtaposed with Snyder's more serious outlook on the comic world and much darker style. Even the score was all over the place, Danny Elfman came in late and probably tried patching things up, but again for the most part things just seem out of place. This is close to a Batman and Robin blooper in terms of cheesy god awful lines and ridiculously inconsistent characters. Something is bleeding and it's bleeding awful. Ben Affleck done his best but he really didn't have the writing for this interpretation of batman. Why is he so obnoxious in this? Lines like when he mentions Steve Trevor seem so out of character even as a motivation tactic, his ideology seems mixed in this follow up of bvs. At times it feels like watching somebody play a video game especially towards the end where the battle scenes are full on CGI. Unfortunately this superhero film ended up in a league of their own and they definitely didn't do this film justice!!!",5,0,0,31 May 2020
Avengers: Endgame," End with no game
","Pretty sure Robert Downey Jr got his lines wrong. What he clearly meant to say is back to the future is clearly a way better depiction of time travel. Long gone are the days where movies had real emotional empathy and believability, they must have got washed up in the shores of time. Great Scott, if only we could go back to when these film had tangible sets and characters with substance and weight. This movie begins where infinity war left off with half the population doing a disappearing act, involuntarily of course. Our main protagonist Iron Man is lost in space and somehow found out of nowhere with very little reason. The new kid on the block has a talent for picking out people from space with, with her arms, or so it would appear. Eat your heart out superman!! Yet we are willing to let most this go, the task of expanding the universe further seems exhausting enough. With a barrel load of character to tackle not even three hours can save this mess. Maybe because they have to stick to their Hollywood Marvel formula and get the routine thirty minute, am I watching a kid play Mortal Kombat? Battle scene in!! The only thing missing is the vintage finish him voice at the finale. Reminence of the battle scene in 'ready player one' springs to mind. Don't misinterpret me I don't mind a well built up epic conclusion but unfortunate this felt like a reversal of what had already materialised in the previous outting. As far as character and acting goes our main bunch handled themselves to the usual standard. We had nice chemistry wisecracks and charisma throughout the film and with regards to pacing it's a little slow to start off with. It's a good thirty to forty five of we're getting the band back together!! Without giving too much away it is a very linear one dimension story but still packs a bit of a punch with some humour and emotion from time to time. With regards to empathy I felt more for the characters towards the end than in the early stages. I felt like they failed at the start where you should feel really sad for the friends they lost but they all seemed to have moved on five years on. Scarlett Johansson's character was the only one who made me feel like it had actually happened. Overall it was an average finish, nothing to go to mad about.",6,8,17,25 April 2019
Batman Begins," Not who I am underneath
","Christopher Nolan brings batman to life with the origin story which had never really been told in on screen. Spending time visiting the cave, where Adam West and Burt Ward raced out of, from the 60s tv show, Nolan and David S Goyer knew they had to return to the roots of what made batman. What's interesting about this film is how much anticipation is created whilst the audience awaits batmans first appearance. With great storytelling we are invested into Bruce Wayne as much as we are batman. The suspense is so thrilling even before he puts on the cape and cowl. With different beliefs to his mentor and the league of shadows Bruce Wayne sets out to find his own purpose. Along with the amazing composing of Hans Zimmer And James Newton Howard we feel the fear and emotional pain of Bruce losing his parents. Henri Ducard becomes a new father like figure to Bruce and trains Bruce in martial arts whilst he has left Gotham. This film has outstanding sequences and great cinematography. Batman is seen in flashes at first like a horror movie creating fear in the eyes of his opponents. Comparing it with modern super hero movies there is a lot more genuine solidility with cgi only being used when it is absolutely necessary. From being filmed on location, to epic full scale narrows and batcaves being built, which is the foundations of this standing out among the rest. One of the most authentic comic book movies ever made. Whilst being a big James Bond fan Nolan even adapted to incorporating Lucus Fox into the mix as your gadgets man. Using state of the art army like gadgets almost everything you see in the movie can be done. With a variety of quality actors from Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Liam Neeson this truely is a movie to bring a comic book film to life at its highest level. A nice twist along the way, for me Batman Begins is not only the best Batman movie to date but also the pinnacle of all comic book movies. Where it all does truely begin.",10,1,1,1 May 2019
Man on the Moon," Carrey is Kaufman
","This film is uniquely entertaining and redefines the words hoax and optical illusion. Jim is so close to what I imagine Andy to be like, even that itself is an illusion. Yet somehow Andy Kaufman lives on in what can only be described in my opinion as Jim Carrey's stand out best performance. The song and dance man, anti humour improvisational comedic, doesn't tell jokes. He is more interested in making himself and his friend Bob laugh at their own genius than entertaining his audience or so it appears. Danny DeVito plays George his stage manager/agent and appears not entirely sure at first what to make of Andy Kaufmans act himself. He may be crazy with surreal gimmicks and untimely motions but George is willing to take the risk with his out of the world man on a moon act. With bizarre alter ego character Tony Clifton and controversial anti women should be in the kitchen act. From the Taxi sitcom to wrestling to appearing on David Letterman, Andy has everyone guessing what's next? Not even George is in the loop with who is in on each act. Andy created a world where the audience were always second guessing and he wanted to stay one step ahead. But when tragedy strikes not even Andys own family can take him seriously.",9,0,0,31 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I'm the heavy
","Once again...but with feeling, blood and of course feet. Tarantino lets lift to create the late 1960s of Los Angeles like only he can, and it works on many levels. Remember stunt man Mike? Well this time it's stunt man Brad. Brad Pitt coming into his own in a movie where it would be unfair to call him anything other than Cliff Booth. The stand out performance in a movie with so many. At a time where everything is changing Rick Dalton played exquisitely captivating by Leonardo DiCaprio is a faded television actor trying to keep himself relevant. Cliff Booth is his stunt double and chauffeur and of course we have Sharon Tate played by the oh so relevant Margot Robbie. Part fiction, part based on truth all these characters stories intertwined in a intense finale only worthy of a Tarantino film. What's interesting is how parts of the film is Rick Dalton acting out his scenes or Sharon Tate even watching her own film in a cinema. Watching someone work, these things would normally be seen as boring to some, but this is no normal director. Tarantino shoots the movie in a way where the minor delicate things matter. Traveling to work...he shoots Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth TRAVELING TO WORK!!! Yet somehow we the audience feel like we are part of their journey in the back seat of the Cadillac. No 3D, no special cgi effect, yet I am compelled to be on the tv set with Rick Dalton,Cliff Booth and yes even Bruce Lee. Just as compelled am I to be in the cinema watching Sharon Tate movies. I wasn't around for the sixties, and I certainly wasn't in Hollywood. Yet now it seems captured to a tee. I didn't know the real story and although this is fiction too I now am interested to find out more. Not only is this a depiction of hollywood and hippies, poor Hollywood vs rich but has some great guest stars like Kurt Russel and my all time favourite Al Pacino. The typical poignant never good enough Hollywood actor must convince himself when enough is enough. The content friend in Cliff Booth and the living life happy go lucky actress Sharon Tate. From cinema drive throughs to playboy mansions and the Manson's lair at the Spahn movie ranch where bounty law was shot, this atmospheric depiction into the life of Rick Dalton is as heartwarmingly fun as it is gore. From sixties style radio playing in the Cadillac to old adverts of his show nothing is more of a homage to that lifetime and nobody is gonna tell Rick Dalton goodnight!!!",9,10,20,16 August 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," I'm distracting you
","Outta nowhere or space comes Marvels first telling of the Guardians of the galaxy. Possibly the most lighthearted and humourous one yet. This is the story of Peter Quill an epic adventure in outta space and a battle for the orb or whatever that does!!!? Later we will discover it will means much more in the marvel cinematic universe as it will be containing an infinity stone. Ronan the accuser is our main antagonist but appears to be given order by someone far more powerful and evil at the core. What's nice about this movie is the tone, it can appeal to both adults and kids for different reasons. It's nothing to be taken too seriously and the plot isn't overly complicated but overall it is still a thrill ride from start to finish. Some self awareness and mockery of the end plan keep this fun feast pulling out every cliche of what is expected. But this is not of the norm, with our talking Raccoon voiced splendidly by Bradley Cooper and the one line wonder Vin Diesel as I am groot!!! Not odd enough for you, add into the mix muscle bound wrestler Dave Batista and you have the full package. Well not quite as Zoe Saldana more than enough holds her own to pack a punch as Gamora. This is very impressive visually too, James Gunn has made his mark on the marvel cinematic universe and we will be expecting to see a lot more from this bizarre bunch. There is some emotional depth too as each classic tune is in remembrance of something Star lord has lost. Although it doesn't have the strongest lineup of antagonists our characters soon become their own worst enemies and create their own issue along the way. Chris Pratt has made star lord one of my favourite marvel characters.",8,0,0,24 November 2019
Thor," Flawless not quite
","Thor is one of the few Marvel films so far to have a really strong villain in Loka with Shakespearean motivations. Stories that go way back, similar to my favourite movie of all time Gladiator. It has the themes of acceptance and jealousy. Thor played by Chris Hemsworth is hungry, egotistical and ready and willing to prove he was the right successor to the throne. Orid father of Thor, sends Thor to earth in exile from home Asgard for his trigger happy war seeking actions on the ice giants. The ice Giants enter the palace in violation of their treaty. Thor reacts with lack of honour to their treaty and must learn the true value of his virtue. On earth he meets Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman where he learns love and value. Striped of his powers and now understanding not all one entire race is evil Thor acts with his heart protecting people he now cares about. The stand out performance comes from Tom Hiddleston as we are left constantly guessing what he is up to next. Envious of his brother believing he to be the true worthy candidate for the throne. Mischievous action is being made back on Asgard. The story is one that has been told many a time but not on Asgard and not with what was fresh characters for the big screen at the time. The visual effects are stunning and leaves us wanting to visit Asgard again in the future. The main downfall of this film is pacing as it does seem to drag at times and the spontaneous relationship between Jane and Thor seems to instant.",7,0,0,5 November 2019
Iron Man," Iron out a few wrinckles
","Before Iron Man and the Marvel cinematic universe there had already been many great superhero films. Batman Begins, Superman 78 and Batman 89. Not so many had heard of Iron Man so this gave a fresh look on a hero for people who hadn't read too many comics. The formula is similar to previous ones. Our hero is almost killed, shades of Robocop and then kept alive. Shrapnel about to enter Tony Starks heart is prevented by new technology keeping him alive. Robert Downey Jr was a fantastic choice to play Tony Stark and kick off the age of comic book movies. It had some competition in The Dark Knight coming out the same year. Tony Stark finds himself in serious trouble and in somewhat desperation comes up with a new plan to protect himself from not only his own weapons, but also to stop them weapons falling into the wrong hands. A terrorist organisation want Tony's latest development the Jericho missile defence weapon and he becomes their hostage until he builds them an exact replica. Robert Downey Jr is perfect as Stark charismatic, intelligent, arrogant and at times childish. An addict to his work with the flaw of not seeing the dangers Stark industries could have on the world, if in the wrong hands. Once this reality comes to light he'll do anything necessary to protect the people of the United States. Jeff Bridges plays Tony's business partner Obadiah Stane and Gwyneth Paltrow is Pepper Potts his assistant. Both are compelling in their respective roles to support Downey Jr, but this is clearly a Downey Jr show. Rhodes is a close friend of Starks in the military and appears to work with Stark unofficially. Terrace Howard doesn't have the longest screen time but what he has is effective. The locations are intriguing and relevant to terrorist issues of our time. Afghanistan terrorist organisation want power of these weapons, the weak point of this movie would have to be the villains. Although weapons mean power and possession of them is everything. This is a comic book film after all and doesn't appear to have a memorable flamboyant villain to go with the well thoughtout heart felt story, of how Stark is willing to change for the good. He sees his company going in the wrong direction and embraces change!!! Iron Monger is standard really not enough screen time to make an impact.",8,0,0,28 October 2019
