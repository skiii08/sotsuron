United 93," Excellent
","I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I decided to go see this movie. I knew that if it was accurate it would be great, and that was more than true in my opinion. Having read the 9/11 commission report, as well as other federal documents on Flight 93, and listening to the phone conversations online, I would have to say that this movie is about as real as you can get in a documentary/style film. The actors looked very similar to the real victims of this tragedy, and I firmly believe that since the film was made with the help of some of the people who experienced the tragedy, it was even better than it would have been. United 93 is a movie that will hit you deep inside. No matter what political affiliation you are, this film will remind you of the sacrifices that these men and women made, and life's true value. 9/11 affected us all in one way or another, some more than others. United 93 is fitting in every way, and is definitely a film everyone should see. A lot of people, especially on the east coast, are saying that it is too early for a movie about September 11. I ask you this then. If it is too early for a film of this matter, then why did the victims families and friends of flight 93 help out with getting the film right? This film is about heroism. The bravery, courage, and selfless-service that those men and women endured on Flight 93, and to have the courage to fight back is a quality that every American should have, and remember.I end this post with the famous words from one of my biggest role models and heroes, Flight 93's Todd Beamer. 'Ok Guys. Are You Ready? Let's Roll!' God Bless America 9-11-01 - WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER",9,2,6,30 April 2006
