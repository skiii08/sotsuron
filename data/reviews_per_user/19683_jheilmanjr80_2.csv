E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," You don't have to be a kid to love this movie...
","Considering the movie came out back in 1982, when I was two, my mother told me that she went and saw it at the theatre with me. Now, 20 years later, I had gotten the chance to take my two year old daughter (nearly three) to go and see it, but I missed out on the chance. I loved the movie when I was a kid and having had my daughter see on it video, she loved it too. I thought the 20th anniversary edition was really cool. It was good seeing a movie with new scenes after seeing the same 1 hour and 45 minutes of regular footage for 15 years. I remember when E.T. first came out on video tape back in I believe, 1988. I was so excited to get this movie that I bugged my mom and dad until they caved and bought it for me. This was also back in the day when VHS tapes costed almost as much as DVD's! (about $24.95) So seeing the movie brought forth to a whole new generation of kids was a really cool experience. This is a movie I plan on..... or rather Santa Claus will bring my daughter for Christmas. If you haven't see it yet (Where have you been?) then I suggest renting or buying it when it comes out on video this month.<ul><li>Jay Heilman</li></ul>",Null,0,0,17 October 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," Best of the Best
","This film in my opinion is one of the best ever made. When I went to the video store one time in 1999, I was in the mood for a drama. It was a toss-up between Shawshank and some other movie. I chose Shawshank. The plot outline on the back of the movie box was very intriguing. It is most definetly the best movie I have ever picked out at a video store. I liked the movie so much that I went and bought it the next day. Few movies have as much talent and drive as this one. Two of the best actors in my opinion, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. What an excellent acting duo. It's a shame that this movie lost Best Picture to 'Forest Gump'. Gump was good, but this one was much better. I gave it a 10. What a great movie!",10,0,1,1 October 2002
