Hereditary," Toni Collette and Ari Aster took me on a ride!
","I didn't know what I was getting into when I went to see HEREDITARY last night. But I knew I adored Toni Collette as a performer, so I took a chance.If I say too much, it'll spoil things, so I wouldn't dare spoil it. I will say that this movie won't appeal to everyone (as a matter of fact, the teens in my screening didn't seem to get it). It's way more psychological and artistic than mainstream horror. As a matter of fact, I'd say the first third of the movie is drama, the second third is suspense and the last third is horror. But even though this tale didn't follow a formula, it worked on my mind like a psychedelic. I cared about the family... and the more and more I saw and discovered what happens to them (including their history) chilled me to the bone the way few genre movies have.",9,26,53,9 June 2018
Call Me by Your Name," infinitely relatable
","I found myself being strongly reminded of my first love... and my most recent love (for radically different reasons) when watching this exquisite tale of the eternal and universal poetry that this story illuminates.Watch this with an open mind and I hope it melts over your heart like warm honey... seeping into every crack that time might've placed there... until, for even a moment, you feel whole.",10,2,8,22 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," among the best
","I had a feeling THE LAST JEDI would be divisive purely for the fact that Rian Johnson (who is known for complex, unusual tales) was the lead creative force behind it. For me, this movie was excellent! It subverted expectations... yet what it did deliver were events, emotions and character arcs that I had no idea I wanted until I saw them. So, the surprises, the substance, along with the permission to break new ground fit with my sensibilities. When I was very young, I thought the Force was like gravity... stagnant and reliable... but more and more the notion that the Force is ever-evolving and reacting to galactic events makes the journey forward less predictable and more interesting... multi-faceted. This new kind of STAR WARS, more sophisticated and open, should herald a new audience into a solid, fascinating and enjoyable franchise.",10,2,14,16 December 2017
