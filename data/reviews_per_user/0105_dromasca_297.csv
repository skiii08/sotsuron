The Double Life of Véronique," the great puppeteer
","Seeing the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski is a special experience, now, more than two decades since he stopped making films, and died soon after. The Polish director's relative short life (he died at the age of 54) and career (less than two decades) is now turning into legend. Each of his films shows the quality and the emotion of a true master of the cinema. 'The Double Life of Veronique' (or 'La double vie de Véronique' in French) is one of his best known movies, made at the peak of his cinema career, between the Decalogue and the Three Colors trilogy. Somehow I missed it at release. Now, in the perspective of the life and death of the director, not only that it stays as a remarkable piece of cinema but it is enriched with new significance.Fate and identity are the two big topics of this film. Have you ever had the feeling that you are not alone or even unique in the Universe, that somewhere or maybe in some other time, a parallel destiny is shared with yours? Did you ever feel like your life is not the result of your own decisions, that higher forces manipulate you life, same as a puppeteer controls his marionettes? If you ever felt something like this or if you can understand or imagine such feelings, this story of two young women, living in two different parts of Europe, sharing talents, feelings and fate without their lives ever intersecting for more than a few seconds, this story should not seem strange at all.Beautiful films (and books, and paintings, and musical works) have complex layers of meanings and a multitude of details that are revealed to the viewer, reader, listener. This is exactly the case with 'La double vie de Véronique'. One can use multiple keys to read the story. There is a political reading about the parallel destinies of the two women who are born and live on the two sides of the curtain that divided Europe and was just falling down by the time the film was made. There is a philosophical reading about destiny and about the controllers of the destiny (the puppeteer, the writer who creates characters and write about their destinies). There is a religious reading with multiple symbols that ask to be examined from the name of the main character to the music that is sung and played during the film.Each of the scenes includes details that support the multiple stories and have their place in it, in some cases relating to other scenes in the peer story. The only exception was the secondary thread about presumptive perjury by the French Veronique whose sense I could not decipher. Music plays an important role, as the two women are musicians, they sing and teach music that reflects their relation with fate and God. So does light, which is in some cases maneuvered by the characters. The mirrors also show up in many scenes, sometimes as a reflection of the self, in other cases as a gate to the other side, as in Lewis Carroll's stories. Shades and mysteries follow the characters and the viewers at any corner and in any moment.Kieslowski's mastering of the art of cinema is matched by the superb acting of Irène Jacob. She is strange and beautiful, sensitive and expressive. I can also wonder why her star paled after Kieslowski stopped making films, and why other film directors could not make better use of her beauty and talent. She is part of the same generation of French and French-speaking actresses as Juliette Binoche for example, but their post 1995 careers were so different. What a pity.I am happy to have discovered 'La double vie de Véronique', even if so late. It's a film to see and see again.",9,2,3,7 October 2017
The King's Speech," meeting history means first wining the fight with his self
","Here is a film whose destiny is to gather a lot of statuettes on the Oscar night this year, and this may be one of its problems in my eyes. The combination between a personal drama doubled by a physical or psychological disability (the stammering of the duke of York to become King George VI of England) which allows for great principal role performances and the obsession of the big screen with the British dynasty may lead for the third time in the last two decades for royalties get an Oscar ovation. It is not that 'The King's Speech' lacks moments of good cinema, a good dramatic build-up and a human touch but somehow it is too much on the side of the predictable to my taste.Being duke of York is probably the most frustrating position on the planet maybe with the exception of being VP of the United States of America. You are one inch apart from the peak of the Universe, and yet most people in your kingdom or republic may not know your face. The spotlights fall so close and you are still in the shadows. Exceptional events do happen sometimes and the second-in-line is pushed ahead and needs to take responsibility. This is what happened with the duke of York who became king at the abdication of his brother Edward, just at the time the world and his country where to face the biggest challenge in history at the outbreak of the second world war. And yet, his historical fight was also a personal fight, as he head to overcome his stammering, a huge handicap at a time when leaders' speech inspired nations and the relatively new media of radio broadcast was the most efficient propaganda instrument in the war.The best moments of the film were for me the human dimensions that the characters of Bertie (King George VI) and Elizabeth received under the acting of Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter. I am no fan of the British royals, but I ended by really sympathizing with their representation in the movie. The personal fight of Bertie, his relation with the commoner family of his speech expert (Geoffrey Rush which is no less than wonderful as we can always expect from him) and the way he ends by facing the call of history at the right moment are well filmed and described. I liked less the way the historical context is described, with characters like king Edward or Winston Churchill reduced to their stereotype. There is one character though which draw my attention and this was Neville Chamberlain in a very exact supporting performance by Roger Parrott. I could not avoid thinking that this complex character and the dilemma of appeasement that marked his political career with the disastrous consequences did not yet get any screen version fit to the dimensions of the historical figure.",8,0,1,6 February 2011
The Lobster," surrealist dystopia
","After seeing 'The Lobster' I have no doubt that Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the most remarkable film directors living and creating today. Each of his films shocks and disturbs, in each one there are copious doses of absurdity and cruelty. These extravagant and extreme elements are not gratuite as they start from real-world situations (or from history as in his latest film) and amplify them to grotesque and nightmares. The nightmares of the Greek director's films are our very existence, or what it could become. 'The Lobster' is among the Lanthimos' movies I've seen, the best structured and the clearest in message. A mute and tragic scream about the dangers of social and family engineering, about the emptiness of our lives and of the relationships between people.The story takes place in the near future, or maybe it's not even the future. Life in couples is the only legal form of existence. Those who do not have or lose their pair are sent to an institution that looks like a luxury hotel under strict control, where they divide their time between finding the right pair, participating in propaganda-educational activities and hunting animals. However, the animals (important as in all of Lanthimos's films) are actually just ex-humans, because if loners do not find their pair in 45 days (plus or minus a few days won or lost in the hunting games) they are entering the 'transformation rooms' and turned into the animal of their choice. When the hero manages to escape, he discovers the world of the opposants, only in dystopia as in dystopia, the opponents are also fanatics, extremists from the lonely side, any connection between them being also cruelly punished. Falling in love leads to tragedy and happiness is not possible in any of the sides of this dark world.The execution is impeccable. As in all the films of Yorgos Lanthimos, we deal with a world whose rules are only apparently familiar to us. The motives of the actions of the characters are often shrouded in mystery. Emotions are controlled by the laws of a society in which fear has become the main resort. Colin Farrell performs one of his best roles, succeeding in rendering the lack of emotional capabilities and the fear of the absurd and the inevitable that is going to happen with remarkable discretion. Bizarre and absurd seem to dominate the world described in this movie, a universe in which Beckett meets Hitchcock, but is our society so far away from it?",9,1,3,20 February 2019
Blade Runner 2049," more than a sequel
","If you have not seen 'Blade Runner 2019' yet, but you plan to see it soon, I have a friendly advice. The film is a continuation of 'Blade Runner' made in1982, and even if the story is not necessarily an extension of the original film, the theme and philosophy of the films are linked, and many of the motivations of the characters as well as the social ambiance of the future imagined in the film can be more easily understood if you first see or review the first movie, or at least read or reread the summary. The dystopian world imagined by novelist Philip K. Dick and director Ridley Scott in the original film, as well as the theme of robots with human characteristics (called 'replicants' in the novel and films) that are at the border between tools endowed with what we call artificial intelligence and equal beings to men, capable of feelings and endowed with what some call 'soul' have become in the decades that passed since a familiar presence in sci-fi cinema, and Ridley Scott's film is considered a 'cult' film. The landscape of the 'retro' style of the future has become a visual reference for many of the distant and / or apocalyptic films that followed, and Vangelis' music adds to the 'noir' sensation of action in the future.'Blade Runner 2049' begins with a text screen (something that I personally am not enthusiastic about in films) describing the events that took place between 2019 (the year when the first film was taking place) and the 2049's 'contemporaneity'. A black-out phenomenon due to an unspecified event (ecological catastrophe? atomic explosion?) produced a high-intensity electromagnetic pulse ('EMP') destroying all electronic devices and memories of mankind. Only what was recorded on paper - books, press, archives - survived. The possibility of such an event is as real as it may be, it can also be caused by high intensity solar rashes, and various emergency scenarios take it into consideration. The industrial concern that produced the replicas had been ruined only to be replaced by another, bigger, stronger, worse, a monopoly of slave robots. The main difference to the world in 2019 is that in 2049 the replicas do not work on distant planets, but they are largely integrated into human society, performing almost all roles and practicing all the crafts. The main character of the movie, 'K' (yes, indeed - 'K' as Kafka) is such a replicant, a policeman at the LAPD. The replicants are apparently fully integrated, they seem to be peers, and they are hard to distinguish, but they are not equal in rights, being merely subordinate and generally disciplined executors of human orders. Physically they seem to be parity with people - they eat and drink, they get tired and sleep, they have sex, they get older, and the blood flows when they get injured. They even die, except they do not give birth and they're not born. Only the ability to be born and to give birth to create life like humans do seems to be lacking.The movie's intrigue triggers when 'K' (played by the excellent Ryan Gosling, one of Hollywood's most talented younger actors) over a case involving an oddity in rgw order of things, starts to ask more questions than the norm , begins to doubt. His questions would upset the social hierarchy that makes replicants simple executors of human orders, and the official version of history on which this hierarchy is based. The order to leave the investigation and to forget the anomalies - which, of course, will be ignored - sends a direct hint to totalitarian regimes, and not only to them, in which a single version of 'truth' is accepted, and in which research of alternative answers becomes a crime. During his investigation, 'K' will face not only the forces of the all-powerful corporation that dominate the economy and public order of the planet, but also secrets related to his own origin and past, revealing traces of his own identity.The disturbing questions about the essence of human nature and the boundaries between humanity as we know it and understand it today, and what it can (some would say it would be) to become over a long time are a recurring theme of the anticipation literature from the first robot stories of Capek, or the novels and stories of Asimov, to films or television productions such as the excellent Swedish series 'Real People' ('Äkta människor'). The spectacular advances in synthetic chemistry, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence make these questions not only topics of the future, but also closer issues related to the present or the near future. Self-learning ability combined with emotion synthesis and emulation, implemented on platforms with speeds and computing power and with much higher reliability than human minds and human bodies, make the robots a new species that begins to compete with humans to control the resources of the planet. 'Blade Runner 2049' describes a possible world where autonomous robots are part of the social hierarchy and have also acquired many of the characteristics that make up the human personality and the specific differences between the different individuals belonging to the species. What's left behind as a barrier that separates mankind from the world of robots? Dilemmas? 'It's not a big deal, do not envy us for that' says in the film a human character to the hero belonging to the world of robots. Ability to love? This is not even certain in the world created in 'Blade Runner 2049' where people and robots seem to share 'resources' that allow sexual gratification, and where differences between humans and robots, or between all of them and virtual embodiments like holograms are not clear or important. The ability to give birth, to create life from your own body? This last barrier may be the real one, but you will have to see the movie to see how the issue is addressed, whatever I would say here would be too much of a 'spoiler'.The project was designed and prepared by Ridley Scott for many years, and the director intended for a while to direct the sequel. He was finally pleased with the role of producer and entrusted the direction of French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, author of several high quality and successful action films such as 'Sicario' and 'Arrival'. The combination of the action film with the intelligent science-fantasy intrigue, which raises issues not only about the evolution of mankind but also about where the directions for the future are drawn, works in the 'Blade Runner 2019' almost as well as in the original film . Ryan Gosling realizes a formidable acting performance in the lead role. In the second part of the film, Harrison Ford shows up as the original 'Blade Runner', the one who had good reasons to disappear from the world of the future between 2019 and 2049. The visual world continues extends what I saw 36 years ago with creative and executed capabilities enhanced by digital graphics. Even if the element of surprise is diminished, and if the world of the future created in the film is a continuation and amplification of the style and atmosphere of the original film, 'Blade Runner 2049' offers plenty of reasons for the satisfaction of filmmakers, not just fans science fiction, questions and raises current issues that deserve in-depth and interesting discussions. If you have not already seen it, I recommend it.",9,2,7,10 March 2018
Angels & Demons," at parity with 'The Code'
","I belong to a small and well-famed minority. I like Dan Brown's novels and I declare it openly. Yes, I came out of the closet as they say. I liked 'The Da Vinci Code' book (not so much the film) and I said it. I was immediately buried under tons of sarcasm, irony, pity. What can I do? Historical mysteries are one of my preferred genres since I read Jules Verne's books or Constantin Chirita's 'Ciresarii' (Romanian speakers may know what I am talking about).'Angels & Demons' the book was written before 'The Code', but the movie comes after, so there is no need to explain too much about the expertise of professor Langdon (Tom Hanks) or why he is called to solve historical mysteries with religious symbols implications. It's good that it's so, because the last thing the script in this film has is credibility. Yes, I enjoy historical riddles, but they need some plausible justification to be inserted in the script, and this justification lacks here completely. Luckily I buy easily the conventions of such movies, so I sat back in my chair and enjoyed the action, which is a combination between James Bond and '24' with Rome and papal intrigues replacing Los Angeles (or New York in the last '24' season) and the US presidency, but with corpses popping up each round hour. Moreover, seeing again the beautiful setting of the streets of Rome one and a half month after my last days of vacation there was also cool.This certainly does not make enough for a great film, or even for a great action film. My main problem with Ron Howard's 'Code' was the fact that he turned the great actors that are Hanks and Tautou unto just good but not very interesting actors. Here Hanks still looks at least as amazed to be in this movie as his character is to be in the middle of all this action, while his partner is now the Israeli actress Ayelet Zorer, which I respect very much for other roles, and I am happy that she got such an opportunity to play with Hanks in a blockbuster but I do not think that they let her use it too well. Maybe in the next film in the series Hanks will be more lucky with a partner to be of interest to him :-) Overall, not a bad action film, not the best either, at parity with 'The Code'.",6,0,0,21 May 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than vol. 1
","I posted mistakenly yesterday a comment that was intended to be for vol. 1. After seeing the first 'Kill Bill' on DVD, I ran to the theaters and saw vol. 2 today - it is better.One may argue whether making violent films about killers is moral. Still if morality of the times is a criteria, many art works would have never made it. 'Kill Bill' is a very good film, vol. 2 explains everything is important in a logical manner, it is superbly filmed and acted - a real treat. As vol. 1 was, vol.2 is full of cinema quotes from Terentino's masters, and for the cinema lovers this is really fun. Action film fans will find less of their preferred stuff in the second film. This did not bother me at all. What I got in exchange is the really tremendous acting of David Carradine. I never forgot what a wonderful actor he can be, but I did not see him in any important film since the 80s. Here he is back, and I hope his acting will not be forgotten until the next Oscars - he deserves at least a nomination in my opinion.
A few words about the ending. Leaving things un-explained as they were at the end of vol. 1 is a better artistic bet. Explaining has its problems, and explaining in films needs to conform to some rules. I think that the script and the director did a good job on this - not perfect, but very good indeed.
9/10 on my personal scale. the best film of this year so far.",9,1,2,8 May 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," That's Entertainment
","Take 'Kill Bill' for what it is - good escapetionist entertainment, and you have good chances to enjoy it. Judge it according to art cinema criteria, and you risk to not like it and miss the fun. Terentino may be one of the most talented film makers around, but his violent and beautiful films are not meant to be more than entertainment, and folks looking for big artistic messages are searching in the wrong place. 'Kill Bill' is a revenge story, as many were written for the big screen since the beginning of the Western history. There is not too much originality in the story - what is different is the art of film making, the smart mix of quotes from all what Terentino likes in the history of cinema, from spaghetti westerns to classic Japanese samurai films, the soundtrack, and of course the unmistakable touch of non-censored violence so typical to Terentino. Overall, the film is entertaining. I saw it on DVD, and I cannot wait for volume 2 release on DVD, so I intent to see it tomorrow in the theater. 8/10 on my personal scale.",9,1,2,7 May 2004
Black Swan," a study in perfection and madness
","'Black Swan' is about art and obsession, is about sanity and madness, it's about perfection and genius, all this described in the world which can be so mistakenly perceived of classical ballet. A world in which the spectator is supposed to get the feeling of fluidity and lack of gravity, of lightness and perfection of movement. However these are acquired by years and sometimes a lifetime of pain in which everything needs to be put aside for the seek of the unique moment of art on stage. Including ones own self.The film starts as a very tightly told story of the art and rivalry in the ballet world. While it develops as a story that without becoming really boring seems to focus too much on the technical issues of the profession and the personal challenges of a young woman who needs to sacrifice all to get on the top, it plants in its first hour the elements of incertitude and build-up of the final segment. Aronofsky plays permanently with the viewers the game of mixing and swapping perceptions between objective and subjective reality. It is not easy viewing and this is on purpose. There is a lot of suffering on screen and most of it is not physical. In order to reach the peaks an artist needs to master the dark side of its art and personality. But when darkness is awaken can it still be kept under control? The balance between art and obsession, between perfection and madness is the ultimate theme of this film. Reaching the peaks of art may demand the descent into the abyss of insanity.Unless a colossal misjudgment intervenes Natalie Portman will hold a statuette by the end of the Oscars night. She deals with an extremely complex role which demands a permanent balance between ingenuity and ambition, fragility and strength of character, loneliness and dedication to art. Of her partners I enjoyed mostly the performance of Vincent Cassel who provides to Portman the mirroring context of her ambition to reach the top of art.When I was a young kid I used to love the animal numbers in circus. Then I read one of Jack London's novels which described the behind-the-scenes of animal training in circus. I never could watch such a show in the arena with the same eyes. I am afraid that folks who love ballet may go though the same risk after seeing 'Black Swan'. They may have seen also one of the most unusual and best films about ballet ever made.",9,2,5,29 January 2011
Men in Black 3," MIB are back  they actually never left us  so what?
","Men In Black are back. 15 years after the first (and best) film in the series Hollywood tries to squeeze some more dollars from the same idea.Sequels are never easy to do. You need both to ensure continuity and bring back what the audiences love in the original and invent so that the repetition does not bring exhaustion and disappointment. Best examples of success like The Godfather or Star Wars were complex stories spreading over generations, developing memorable characters and bringing to screen new emotions and passions in each one of the new installments, even if they not all were as best as the initial films. Well, MIB is no Godfather or Star Wars, neither is Barry Sonnenfeld a Scorsese or George Lucas. Men In Black III has more downs than ups.The good news first? Well, it's available (also) on 3D. Don't forget to order 3D tickets as I did, as many of the screenings are banal 2D. Hint - the tickets on 3D are even more expensive that usual. Two new actors join the team - Josh Brolin doing a fine job as a young version of Tommy Lee Jones' character (yes, good guess, there is some time travel involved) and Emma Thompson who is always lovely to see, even when she has a too thin part as here. The less than good news? Well, there are no surprises, no new jokes to remember, no ideas that make the film really different or funnier or scarier than the previous series. The retro parts are very much the same we have seen in scores of other films since Back to the Future, the bad guy has bad teeth, and the story has holes as big as the cosmic warps with a touch of melodrama that does not add really anything good.Is it worth paying the ticket to see the film in theaters? Well, maybe yes, if you are in 'just' for entertainment and you are ready to accept conventions and to put logic to rest for a couple of hours, than you have chances to enjoy the film. If you are a MIB aficionado you will go and see it anyway, so I can just wish you to have fun!",4,7,15,27 May 2012
Frost_Nixon," strong docu-drama about one of the important moments in this history of America and of television
","Between two Dan Brown movies Ron Howard directed this strong docu-drama about one of the most controversial presidents in the American history. The interview that Richard Nixon gave to the British talk-shows host David Frost in 1977 was seen by Nixon as a means to rebuilt his public image badly damaged by the Watergate scandal. By selecting Frost a non-American and apparent outsider as a interviewer he was hoping to find a more easy or good willing partner of discussion, but he missed the fact that the born-for-TV professional also saw in this confrontation the big chance of his career. The resulting minds fight between the two is the focus of the film.There is a second and also very interesting plan of discussion here. David Frost was not a political commentator, or even an investigation journalist. He was a talk shows host, and the question asked is whether entertainment television can be up for the task of catching such important moments in the life of the nation. The answer given in the film is positive, although in real life I am not sure if this great TV moment was not rather the exception than the rule.As in other films of his Howard is great in bringing to screen the works of great and fascinating minds. He is helped here by the fabulous acting of two actors who are not stars but approach bravely the roles and gave big performances, not by trying to mimic the physical appearances of their heroes but more by focusing on their characters. Especially Frank Langella is bright in his rendition of Nixon, a role previously played by Anhony Hopkins in the 1995 biographical film. Langella's Nixon is less brutal and more complex and sophisticated than Hopkins made him on screen, he is a great conservative communicator, a Reagan avant-la-lettre. His human dimension as well as the limitations due to his conservative approach to life and policies show obviously. At least on screen thanks to Langella's performance Nixon's image seems somehow rehabilitated.",9,1,2,19 April 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," testing the limits of satire and hidden camera movies
","In the very heated debates this movie has generated one aspect seems to be forgotten very easily. The genre 'Borat' plays with is by no means new, it is the good old practical jokes film, where real persons are filmed on hidden camera exposing their real character when they are not aware about the presence of the camera. It's only that here the victims of the authors of Borat do know that they are on camera, but they believe that 's for a different reason.The whole difference lies in the purpose. The authors have chosen to present a manifesto about today's America and the way it relates to other cultures, to visitors and to the minorities living in the US. Does it look bad? Does it look worse than it really is - certainly it does, but yet the existence or racial prejudice, religious bigotry or intolerance is not a matter of numbers, and it is fair game in the satiric game. This is what shows like SNL are doing in the US for ages.The style of the movie is a complete opposite of the Hollywood comedy style. No exact script, improvisation, all is a huge practical joke with a true background. Everybody is being laughed at, including the characters of movie itself, and the acting of Sacha Baron Cohen is perfect, not only by its comic balance, but also or especially taking into account the permanent stress and sometimes real danger he must have worked under during the making of the whole movie. 'Borat' is not a perfect film, but it is the genre of comic movie that only a democracy can afford and a democracy needs.",8,2,6,26 December 2006
Mission: Impossible III," one of the good action films of the year
","In a year that was not blessed with many good action films (I have yet to see the new James Bond though) MI3 succeeds to catch the eye and offers two good hours of reasonable popular entertainment. The director J.J.Abrams is at his first big studios movie, his record just includes a few episodes in the TV series 'Alias' but the directing hand is sure and there are no major flaws. The story is rather standard in the genre, it does involve some hi-tech gadgets, it takes us in more than one continent, and includes a car chase on a oversea bridge as requires, there is also some romantic and emotional component, which fits well in the story and makes us care about the characters. Tom Cruise seems to enjoy the role, and is that the series are not at their end.",7,1,2,9 December 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," solid and funny gangster movie
","Director Paul McGuigan tried his hand in a few genres with mixed success. I liked less his romantic drama 'Wickers Park' but I enjoyed the medieval mystery drama 'The Reckoning'. Here he enters the Terentino territory and the result is good entertainment if you are not intimidated by some violence on screen.What looks like a story of mixed identity succeeds to become much more, thanks to a good and surprisingly funny dialog, interesting although somehow mannerist camera work, and very solid acting from Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu and Bruce Willis. Of course, I cannot forget Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley, who hardly can do something wrong on screen nowadays. The actors and the director seemed to have had fun doing the film, and the fun was passed to the viewers.",7,0,2,22 September 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Good, But Not A Masterpiece
","Darren Aronofsky's movie is considered by many as a masterpiece, equal or even better to 'Clockwork Orange'. I am cautious to join this chorus.This is a good film indeed. Four characters in the American suburb that became the background of some of the best movies in the last few years start spiraling down in an accelerated manner due to drug problems. Mother and son, different generations, are both victims of drug addiction, each in the specific manner belonging to their age. Their dream are artificial ones, Sparking American dreams from outside, rotten inside. One of the many good scenes brings them into what may look like their happier moment, but you soon realize that they already have started the free fall. More social comments are being made, including a tough view of the American TV sub-culture. Acting is remarkable. Best are the two lead feminine roles - Jenmifer Connelly and especially Ellen Burstyn, with an Oscar-level performance. This director knows to get the best from his actors.So, what's wrong? In my view the film is too obvious, too didactic. Drugs are a problem, and this film makes a strong case against drugs. As tough and hard to watch as it is, seeing this film should be mandatory in schools in US and other parts of the Western world touched by the drugs plague. But the didactic tone lowers the artistic quality. All what happens with the characters, as shocking and disturbing as it might be, is predictable after the first ten minutes of the film. Some ambiguity would have helped, and I hope that the director will avoid the manifesto style in his coming movies. He is really one big talent to watch. The film gets 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,0,1,7 June 2003
Captain Phillips," much more than an action thriller at sea
","There are a few good reasons for me not to like Captain Phillips. I am not a big fan of 'stories inspired by real events', especially when they try to follow closely the 'real events'. This film is based on real events, was made only a few years after the events occurred, and according to many accounts is quite accurate in following the real story. Yet the story does not get lost at any moment and tells much more that a docu-drama. It is a real strong drama by itself. I also dislike stories where unarmed and empty-handed heroes succeed to subdue armed and superior forces. There is no such thing here, the fight that is taking place (and there is a hell of a fight) is much more about psychology and about the power of will and spirit than the power of muscles and arms. Here is an American anti-hero rather than an American hero who survives and overcomes because of his anti-hero forces.I did learn a few things about modern piracy that I did not know. Commercial ships - it appears - are not carrying arms and their crews look more like a gang of corporate technicians (they even are organized in unions), even when they sail oceans infested by pirates. This makes the boarding of a huge American commercial ship by four machine guns armed Somali fishermen turned into pirates and the subduing of the American crew of 20 possible (I avoid using 'credible' because it really happened). The resulting confrontation which becomes a thriller at sea makes 'Captain Phillips' a well paced and smartly filmed action movie, and the suspense is in the air all the time. Even as we know how it ends we are curious to understand how director Paul Greengrass (who directed both the real facts inspired United 93 as well as part of the fiction Bourne films) will lead us to that end.One of the reasons of the success is no doubt named Tom Hanks. He can do no wrong and we all know it. He does even more here. If there was no concept of super-anti-hero before he just invented it. There is much more in his facing of his captors and the dialog with their leader who is so well acted by Barkhad Abdi that I had to go to Wikipedia to make sure that he is indeed a professional actor and not a fisherman from the coast of Somalia, maybe even one turned pirate. What we have here is a reflection about power. Who has the power? the guy with the gun? the guy with the bigger boat? What are the limits of having at hand the best technology and the best army, being able to launch satellites, send helicopters and deploy the best armed forces - does this ensure the safety of your (our!) mode of life? Great questions, and there are no definite answers in this piece of real history brought to screen, but the film has the huge merit of asking them.",8,0,1,29 December 2013
The Equalizer," the quiet exterminator
","Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) should be a super-hero. After all only a super-hero can destroy in 28 seconds the US East Coast command center of the Russian mafia (actually exceeding by 9 seconds his plans), can survive an army of armed and dangerous enemies in a Home Depot, even saving the lives of all his good friends, and then take a flight to Russia to destroy the whole organization's brains in the viper's nest.It is actually the anti-hero vision of the character that gives this story a high dose of credibility. Yes, I am incredulous of having said it :-) Denzel's character building is so rigorous, so precise, so human that he not only builds himself as the positive character we as viewers can sympathize with, but also lightens the whole story, which otherwise would be a brutal encounter between yet another retired agent and the world which would not let him enjoy his quiet reading and lattes at night hours, a world full of violence, of human traffic, of ladies in distress silently shouting for help with nobody to hear but Hollywood super-heroes.Director Antoine Fuqua seems to make amends to me for Olympus Has Fallen which I liked much less for various reasons. I would have liked Chloe Grace Moretz to be more on screen, but her absence for much of the screen time after having been the trigger of the story has logic. The Equalizer is based on a TV series from the 80s which I did not see or maybe I forgot, but there is enough good material in this film - including mystery hints about Robert McCall's past including a tragically lost love - to make me hope that this is another start of a series, on big screen this time.",7,1,4,23 November 2014
War Dogs," selling weapons is not nice kids business
","'War Dogs' is the second movie 'inspired by a true story' that I have seen in the last 24 hours, and is actually the one that I liked better (the other one being 'The Infiltrator'). Its film-making style (director Todd Phillips) and its comic thriller approach fit well the month of August. If I am to chose one easier entertainment with no super-heroes or space-ships, and yet a film that raises serious issues this summer, I will recommend it (but of course, I did not see them all).I am not sure if 'War Dogs' will make it to too many Jewish film festivals, but the two lead characters are Jewish or better say one nice Jewish kid (acted by Miles Teller) and a one Jewish trouble-maker kid (acted by Jonah Hill) who meet about one year after high-school. The bad guy is already in weapons trade and he easily convinces the good guy to become an associate. It's the Bush-Cheney period, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan need arms, and the government seems to have privatized at least part of the guns and ammo supply chain and opened it to free competition. A golden business opportunity for many, including the couple of young entrepreneurs who start small, win bigger and bigger contracts, break more and more moral rules, laws and trade restrictions, move into bigger offices and houses, and ask themselves less and less questions about what is right and what is wrong to do in such business.The film is fun to watch. There is no great characters development, the characters are from the start to the end what they seem to be when they show up for the first time, but they are enjoyable, and Jonah Hill at least does here his best role on screen to date. Bradley Cooper also shows up in a small but key supporting role. Story telling has pace and humor, although I could have given up the off-screen story telling which tries to provide the personal and somehow moralizing perspective of the good guy. It seems to be a returning fashion in the American cinema which I frankly dislike. It usually hides lack of skills in setting the contest and telling the story, but it was not the case here.It's the final titles before the credits, the one that usually relate the characters on screen with the reality of the 'true story' and show the real faces of the 'heroes' that we have seen acted on screen, that made me click. So these guys, who sold lethal weapons that caused death in the battlefields of Iraq or Afghanistan, who tricked the government and the individuals fighting for what they believe is a just cause got a few years in jail (one of them) and a suspended sentence (the other one) and they are now selling their story in books and movies? Something is broken in our justice systems if the 'war dogs' selling illegal weapons to the conflict areas are not punished. This film is not a masterpiece, but at least it causes to some of us to ask the right questions.",6,5,10,26 August 2016
Source Code," a techno-thriller with brains and soul
","Source Code is a rare kind of a film nowadays. A techno-thriller with brains and soul. No easy task, but apparently not a first for director Duncan Jones whose previous film Moon (which I did not see yet) has a large number of fans. This second full feature film establishes him as one of the most interesting directors in a genre which is not lacking opportunities in Hollywood, it is missing exactly the intellectual quality and the emotions that he is bringing on the set.The main hero of the story is a US officer fighting in Afghanistan who wakes up in a train speeding to Chicago in the company of an attractive young woman and soon realizes that his identity and appearance have changed. A few minutes later the train explodes in a terror attack, and he wakes up in his own skin in the constrained space of what looks like a space capsule, to be briefed and learn that he has just lived the last eight minutes in the life of another person. By means of a combination of quantum physics and computer engineering he will be able to return several times in the speeding train and re-live the same events accumulating the knowledge from the previous instances, in alternate runs of the reality, with the goal of finding the terrorist and preventing a second much more damaging attack. Inevitably he will fall in love with the young woman in front of him and tray to save her life and the lives of the other people in the train. It is just that succeeding would actually sliding in a different reality or a parallel universe, name it as you wish.Science in movies would almost in all cases fail you in technical universities exams, and the one in Source Code would probably not rank better if put under academic scrutiny. It has however two qualities that are important for the film - they allow for the repetition in a constrained space which provides the unity of space and time so dear to writers of good story since the Greek tragedies, and it is exposed gradually and learned by the main hero at the same time as the viewer, which helps us identify with the dilemmas and emotions of the character. Jake Gyllenhaal is an excellent choice for the role and all the other characters support him like a web threaded around his fight against the time to discover the truth and the moral and emotional choice that he makes in the final. A well made film, not too long, not too expensive (but not lacking a few spectacular moments), smart and sensible. One of a rare kind nowadays, did I already say it?",8,0,1,2 October 2011
Skyfall," 21st century Bond
","The century is the 21st according to one of the popular counting methods and 'Bond, James Bond' is still spoken from the screen by a man dressed in a tuxedo with a glass of a selected cocktail in hand. Yet, very many things are new in the last few films in the series (now at #23 if I am not mistaken) and the traditional casino scenes, the exotic locations, the gadgets and even the fabulous Bond girls, without being completely pushed to the back seats are secondary in the recently released 'Skyfall'. It's a new world, a world where the good guys in the service of Her Majesty are no longer fighting the bad guys on the other side of the Iron Curtain, as there is no longer any such Curtain. Not only the enemy is no longer clearly defined by politics or nationality, but he can actually be one of 'us'. Bond himself is no longer an infallible gentlemen feeling no pain and encountering no failure, he actually fails, and falls, and is wounded - physically and psychologically. Daniel Craig is a completely different type of actor than the first (big) names who took the role, he is not only better, but also has a much more distinct human dimension. No longer a super-hero. Hardly a hero.Is the new James Bond better? I would say yes, but not much better. Certainly, the realistic touch brought by director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road) is an interesting turn. For the first time maybe in a film in the James Bond series we are watching a Bond and an 'M' which are not only flesh and blood, but also complex human beings, with doubts and dilemmas that we can understand and resonate with. The question however for me is to what extent these human dimensions work in the context of a mega-action series whose rules are not only set from start but also known by almost anybody who chooses to come and see the film. This is a film I liked, but now, two or three hours after I watched it I can say that I liked it because of the same good all reasons that I liked all good James Bond films - for the fabulous action scenes (and there are a few memorable ones in the film), for the variations on the old familiar characters (and I loved the new 'Q') and for the balance between tradition and innovation. It is not for the psychological deepness of the characters that I (and many other fans) go to see a Bond film. The problem is not that the characters are not deep and real, but that these aspects of the film are too overloaded, and if the film seems to be a bit too long it is just because of these.Some of the acting is very much to the point. Judi Dench gives a great performance (possibly her last one in the series) which puts in shadow all other characters in what is probably the first Bond film without a real Bond girl to receive consistent screen time. Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw, and Naomi Harris mark the new generation that will probably take further familiar characters in the next 21st century installments, while Javier Bardem adds his name to the illustrious series of Bond villains. Times are achangin' and so are slowly the Bond films. For good? We still are too see, but there are signs it's the right direction. If we are to look back 50 years after, it's only Her Majesty who did not really change since the series started!",7,2,9,24 November 2012
50 First Dates," at the edge of ridicule
","'50 First Dates' competes for the title of the worst film of the year. The story is set in Hawaii, and the hero is a local skirt-chaser falling in love with a girl hit by a kind of amnesia that makes her forget overnight everything that happened before the car accident she went through. The idea of falling in love again each day has some potential, unfortunately the script goes all the time the easy way, combining bad taste and bore. The cinematography does not exceed in quality vacation commercials. The humor, if we can call it so is worse than in TV comedy series, reminding the 60s animals series for children. Drew Barimore acts decently, but cannot save this bad film alone. 3 out of 10 on my personal scale.",3,2,4,16 September 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg having fun
","Steven Spielberg seems to have had some fun doing this movie, and he is trying to make the viewers feel the fun too. I am no big fan of the true crime stories, but this is the second I saw recently (the other was the more recent 'Zodiac') that I really liked.The charm of the movie lies mostly in the recreation of the 60s with techniques of the 60s movies and some quotes from the James Bond movies for example, all combined with the fine story telling skills of Spielberg. Added here is the excellent performance of Leonardo DiCaprio which I have quite mixed feelings about generally but who fits here perfectly playing at 28 the role of a teenager who incarnates 28 years old characters. Together with Leo we can see Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, whose relationships with him as the detective following him to obsession and as his father are key in the logic of the character and of the film.Spielberg is now famous and proved everything he had to prove. In the last ten years he tried different genres, and seems to do a good job in most of them. The one thing that we may lose is who is the real Spielberg, what is this strong voice trying to say. For this we need to go back to the 70s and the 80s, or maybe see again 'Schindler's List'. Between those we may also have some fun seeing a fun movie like this one.",8,1,3,8 February 2008
Marie Antoinette," you cannot stay indifferent to this Marie Antoinette
","For those who come to see this movie with the expectation of seeing some historical drama or biography, this is a very different and special experience. Sofia Coppola in 'Marie Antoinette' takes the pretext of the life of the famous and infamous last queen of France and makes out of it a drama about the solitude of a young girl in a strange environment. Acted superbly by Kirsten Dunst Coppola's Marie Antoinette looks at some instances like a teenager today with modern haircut, closer to Scarlett Johansson's character in 'Lost in Translation' than to the historical character. Is the experiment successful on all plans? Certainly not, as the film gets too much into the details of the life at the court, of the garments and chocolates and interior decoration, at the expense of the differentiation of the characters that surround Marie Antoinette. So much is the movie centered around her that it is hard to distinguish the other characters around. The usage of punk music has a strong effect at the start, plays well in the ball scene, but starts to fit well later and becomes too repetitive. What we get overall is an interesting and different movie, but not a perfect one.",6,0,2,24 July 2008
The Ring," An Unpleasant Experience
","Well, a horror movie should not be a pleasant experience, should it? What I actually mean is that 'The Ring' is an unpleasant artistic experience, and this despite being actually well filmed. The director seems to be one of these technically skilled people, capable of taking a story and translating it into good cinematography. The problem is that the story has no logic, time is badly manipulated, there is no emotion to connect the viewers to the guys supposed to be good in the story, and frankly not enough thrill to make this a memorable horror film. The end which is suppose to explain what this was all about (need it?) is kind of a ridiculous joke, imported from the 'Gothic' stories. I realize that many people actually liked the film, but in this case I need to be rather on the critics side. 'The Ring' is a mediocre film, and there are not too many reasons to recommend it to my friends. 6/10 on my personal scale.",6,0,1,22 April 2003
United 93," the day the world changed
","There are milestones in history, days when the word changed, when tomorrow was a different world than yesterday. June 28, 1914 - start of WWI. September 3, 1939 - start of WWII. 9/11 - arguably start of WWIII.The story of 9/11 only starts being reinvented by Hollywood. What is for sure is that it will look different than the 9/11 that we all lived through. This is why I appreciate even more a film like 'United 93' which does not try to present an embellished story, does not play on patriotic or even politic chords, uses actors whose faces are as anonymous as the faces you can see in a real airport, and catches not the spectacular but the human dimension of the event. The characters in the movie are people like us, who are caught in a moment of craziness of history. They all behave like human and not like superheroes, they fear, they pray, they cry for their loved ones. Even the terrorists are veridical, they have fear, the sweat an pray - just human on the wrong side of history.Director Paul Greengrass' previous movie 'The Bourne Supremacy' was a imaginary thriller almost hard to watch because of the nervous cut in very short sequences, which intended to create a dynamics of its own in the minds of the viewers. What did not work well there works pretty good in the real-life thriller 'United 93', and combined with hand-held camera gives a feeling of authenticity to one of the best docu-drama that I have seen lately.",8,1,2,2 February 2007
Minority Report," Black and Dark Future
","Technology does not necessarily means progress. Or progress may not be perceived as progress by everybody. This seems to be the message of some of the later films by Spielberg. It's a good theme, as we may learn a lot about present not only by looking into our past, but also by looking into our future. In other words, the SciFi Channel may be as instructive as the History Channel!Is 'Minority Report' a good movie? I think the answer is yes, but it is not a great one. I think Spielberg is probably the greatest director alive, but I did not like AI. 'Minority Report' is better, it deals with big universal subjects - the right to privacy, and the fact one is innocent before it's proved he is guilty. The fluency of action is back, but so is the mixed choice of actors. I personally do not like Tom Cruise, but Max von Sydow was fascinating! Some of the futuristic gags are nice, but we have seen too many 21st century dark cities already to be really impressed.I think that what happened with other films of Spielberg will happen with this one also. They seem to look better at the second visioning, and behave like good wine (or good movies should I say?) - they become better in time. For now it's a 8/10 - but hey it's a 8/10 on Spelberg's scale.",8,0,0,4 September 2002
In Bruges," Beauty and Violence in Bruges
","I had the chance to see a few years ago one of Martin McDonagh's plays 'Pillowman' and came to know one of the more interesting theater authors today. 'In Bruges' is his first feature film, and while his path from a controversial and successful author of theater to director reminds David Mamet, the characters and mood of his film are more related to the world of Tarantino.Here is the story. Ken and Ray are two Irish mob killers who are sent into hiding after having murdered one more innocent victim than necessary. As our gangsters have a soul the younger of the two is full of remorse for the collateral victim who happened to be a kid, and as the gangsters world has a code of honor the elder of the two is charged with applying the capital punishment to the younger one. Here comes one of the best scenes I have seen recently on screen, with Ken with a gun at hand walking in a park towards Ray with the intention to kill him, and ending by saving his life by preempting his suicide. Genial - I believe that this scene may win an Oscar for original script to Martin McDonagh.The city of Bruges is playing more than a background role in the film. With its so European order, cultural atmosphere and quiet beauty it contrasts at first sight with the brutal characters sent into hiding under the disguise of the world worst tourists. And yet it is the simple humanity of the place and civility of its people that ends by engulfing the two heroes and making them find inside themselves the resources of questioning the sense of their own actions. The middle of the film takes almost a moralistic and religious tone when dealing with these issues. When the brutal world the two belong to surges back under the person of the mafia boss come to fulfill the rules of the crime world code of honor, even his actions end by submitting to the ritual of European politeness. As in his plays, you are never sure whether McDonagh is ironic or respectful towards the world he describes.Good acting helps a well told story, which develops in a natural manner despite the quite unusual premises. Colin Farrell, an actor that critics love to hate for roles like the ones in 'Alexander' or 'S.W.A.T.' is simply marvelous as Ray, the young gangster hitting hell at his first murder, trying to redeem himself and showing that he is so much better than his own actions. Brendan Gleeson as Ken, the elder, wiser and even more cultural-prone of the two adds his own human dimension, enhanced in a classical gangster movies ending which otherwise looks somehow not fit into the rest of the film. Ralph Fiennes is cast here completely against his type (another fine choice of the director) and does a wonderful job as the hysterical mafia boss enforcing the code of honor to its ultimate consequences. Clémence Poésy provides the romantic trigger igniting the spark of humanity in Ray, while Jordan Prentice allows to the director the throwing of ironical arrows towards David Lynch and the dwarf-haunted surrealistic dreams in his movies.Hopefully McDonagh will continue this path of his career as film director after this remarkable start. His own play-writing with the cut-edge irony, black humor and the sharpness of drawing his characters is probably the best source of inspiration and the best chance for his voice to become fully original, away from the other film makers who influenced his beginning.",8,1,3,24 January 2009
John Wick," aesthetic and violent
","As John Wick: Chapter 2 is on screens and gets unexpected good reviews and not only from fans, I thought that it's a good opportunity to see the first and original John Wick which also received some positive echos, much above what is typically delivered for a film in its genre. It's certainly a matter of setting expectations, but I personally was not disappointed. If violent action movies are one of the genres that entertain you, good chances that you will not be disappointed either.Rule #1 to enjoy such a film is to accept the conventions of the genre. The story takes place in the parallel universe of the crime underworld. Although bodies start to accumulate in piles pretty soon, there is no policeman in view with the exception of one cop showing up at one point, looking at the scene of the carnage and wishing good evening to the hero who happens to be a professional killer. This parallel universe is not lawless, it's just that the laws or better said the rules are different. There is a code of honor, there are territories of neutrality, and there is only one punishment - death - for breaking rules or trespassing borders. At the roots of the story stands a failed tentative by the main hero to break the cycle of violence of his profession and jump in the universe of normal people. All this is just memories when the action starts. This film is for Keanu Reeves what 'Jack Reacher' is for Tom Cruise and I suspect that at some point even taking the name of the hero as a title is not a coincidence. It's the start of a series and the second installment was not too late to come.Assuming you bought into the story and the convention, there is some good stuff to enjoy. Stuntman Chad Stahelski is sitting for the first time on the film director chair and he delivers exactly what is expected - a coherent story telling and perfect choreography of the many action scenes that occupy more than half of the duration of the movie. Keanu Reeves delivers what is expected, and a few other fine actors show up in small and even smaller supporting roles. Cinematography is just beautiful, with combinations of dark colors that fit well the violent dark universe that they populate. If you can just forget how sketchy the whole story (or pretext) of the film is, you have good reasons to enjoy it.",6,1,3,31 March 2017
Rocketman," the Rennaissance of the musical genre continues
","Elton John accompanies my passion for pop and rock music for nearly 50 years. I confess that I was not an unconditional fan of Elton over all these years, the celebrities with bizarre behavior have not been and are not my cup of tea, but this musical directed by Dexter Fletcher managed not only to captivate me and make me vibrate (again ) to the music, but also to bring to light some of the roots of his way of being. Now, when Elton John's career seems to get close to an end (at least the touring part), there are chances for me to return to the ranks of his fans, thanks to this film.Dexter Fletcher should initially have directed 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and he was the one who finished the film after Bryan Singer left the production. In 'Rocketman' producer Elton John entrusted him from the very beginning with responsibility of making a film about his own biography, childhood, coming to age, building his artistic personality and personal crises. He was right, I guess. Fletcher demonstrates again his huge talent in making the audience live again the atmosphere of the British pop world of the years of glory and to get to know the heroes of this revolution with their musical genius, but also their personal problems, the confrontation with life as stars, with drugs, alcohol, sexuality. His contribution to the revival of the musical genre can not be disputed, but I think it's more than that, because Fletcher combines in his films the limits and freedoms of the 'musical' genre, which became part of the mainstream in Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s and the vibration of British rock. It is, if you want, a cinematic equivalent of the fusion that took place half a century ago between the pop in England and the rock and soul coming from overseas, from America.The fact that Elton John is an executive producer of the film may, on one hand, be an assurance to viewers that the biographical information presented in the film is accurate and verified, but may also raise the suspicion that the film conceals some less comfortable details. It seems to me that the latter doubts can largely be eliminated. The script written by Lee Hall does not make many concessions to the characters of the singer's parents, nor to the ones of the more or less true friends who accompanied his career, and especially not to Elton John himself. The singer is shown in the periods he searches to define himself as a musical personality but also as a human being, including in the uncomfortable relationships with those around him, with his loneliness and the crises that brought him to the verge of suicide just when he was reaching the peak of his career. Homosexuality issues are addressed much more directly than in the 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. The choice of Taron Egerton for the lead role of the artist's maturity period seemed to me to be excellent. The little-known actor shows his talent becoming Elton John on screen (including singing the musical part). The film is much less a musical biography in the strict sense of the cinematic genre and much more a true musical, with songs and dance numbers inserted in the story, not as entertainment but as a way of expression in the most dramatic points. But the film is entertaining, and sensitive, and a pleasure to watch and listen to. It's a good substantial musical that has the chances of winning new fans for Elton John, now and in the future.",9,5,9,12 June 2019
A Star Is Born," art of the remake
","I find it quite funny when film critics or fans lament the 'lack of originality and creativity' of the contemporary movie makers using as an example the relative high number of remakes at Hollywood or big studios in other countries. After all cinematography is not the only art where the use of the same theme, characters, and sometimes of the same text or musical score is current practice. It is certainly used in theater or music which recycle the classical repertory of plays or symphonic compositions, completely new works being the exception rather than the rule. So I have no problems with remakes in cinema. Having said this I would also add that it's no easy task to make an interesting remake on topics or with characters and action that are well known to the broad audiences. New scripts and stories have the advantages of the surprise and of the thrill of the unknown. For a remake to be successful it needs to bring a fresh perspective and to add value to the existing familiar theme, it needs to figure out how to trigger new emotions in the hearts and minds of the viewers who 'already know how it ends'. All these conditions are in my opinion met by the latest version of 'A Star Is Born' the debut as director of Bradley Cooper who also cast himself in the lead role with pop superstar Lady Gaga as partner.The 21st century version of 'A Star Is Born' adds to the well known story a couple of dimensions related to the music industry which changed so much since the previous remake in the 70s. The already famous musician is a rock star, his life as an artist takes place on the scenes of the never ending tours circuit, his excesses and the roots of his down-spiraling life track can be found not only in his own soul but also in the style of life full with excesses that is shared by so many rock stars, to the point where it becomes almost a condition for success. She is not only an aspiring artist singing in bars while not even daring to dream to a musical career, but also a talent which soon after gleaming in the public eyes is targeted to embark on a commercial pop rather than a rocker career. In this remake of the known story, not only are the two careers on crossing paths (her ascending, his descending) but they also go on divergent artistic roads - classic rock vs. commercial pop. Do both tracks allow for success as well as for artistic accomplishment? The lessons about 'be yourself and say what you need to say in order to become an artist' seems obvious in the first part, but seems to enter in conflict with the destiny of the two musicians as the story develops. The very decisive stand taken by the script writers and the director seems obvious to me, but it's not really the accepted vision in the industry nowadays, and one could say that even the career of Lady Gaga can be seen as a counter-example to the destiny of the character that she incarnates on the big scene.I must confess my pleasure and emotion in watching the story of two artists and of their relationship. The rock concert scenes in the first 30 minutes of so of the movie are among the best I can remember. Bradley Cooper does what most great actors do when they first cross the line and seat behind the camera - he directs his actors with a clear concept of what he wants to receive from them while allowing for the degree of freedom that makes each of them happy to be on screen in his film. The result is a very coherent and vibrating gallery of supporting characters. Cooper and Lady Gaga have a fantastic chemistry on screen. It's not easy to play a role that was previously acted byJudy Garland and Barbra Streisand and Lady Gaga succeeds not only to create a new character but also to all but efface the older versions from our memories. As a film director Bradley Cooper seems to have followed the advice his hero gives in the film: kook inside yourself to seek for what you have to say, the most important thing as an artist is to be true to his own emotions. The result is a film which is deeply moving and a pleasure to watch and listen to.",9,0,1,27 November 2018
Gravity," floating in space
","Almost every pre-Academy Awards season brings for me the big Hollywood movies disappointment. A big studios film, usually directed by famous or at least interesting directors, getting raving critical acceptance and breaking audiences records for the year or for the eternity. A few years back the name of the sensation was Avatar, last year it was Lincoln. I go, I buy my popcorn, I sit down with the best intentions of enjoying it, and ... flop. When I exit the cinema theater I ask myself 'Is this all?'. 'What is the fuzz about?'.This year with Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity it's even worse than in the past years.Before you ask - yes, I have seen the 3D version in a well equipped cinema theater. I saw it in good visual and sound conditions and I was not enthusiastic at all about the cinematography and sound effects. I actually believe that cinematography was quite banal, and the few moments when some screwdrivers flew to our faces could not compensate for a film that takes place 80% in the open space - meaning open stellar space, and cannot provide even the National Geographic documentaries effects or emotions. The story is completely incredible from any point of view. If this is supposed to be science-fiction the science is completely flown, and the fiction non-credible. In other words, impossible on all grounds.Neither can Sandra Bullock and George Clooney save this film. To their defense I should say that they are given a very cliché relationship to act. Clooney's hero text actually provides some of the rare sources of emotion and fun in this film, but this is too little.Alfonso Cuaron directed previously at least one science-fiction film I fell in love with - Children of Men. What a difference between the action-ridden and the human tension there and the routine stuff we get in Gravity. I can understand his attraction into making such a film, it's a challenge for a director to film a story in either a small and confined environment or in the infinite space as here, and some of the greatest successes came from movies with theme like this. Unfortunately, he was not up to the challenge on almost any respect.",5,2,5,26 December 2013
Se7en," Strong, Dark and Violent
","I had somehow missed seeing 'Se7en' when it went out in the theaters. Now, four good films after ('The Game' and 'Fight Club' among them), this 1995 movie of director David Ficher still stands as an original and strong creation. This is not an easy film - much more violent and graphic than the usual detective drama. It's a multiple murder story, in an American city of eternal rain, ugliness and violence. The two main characters, played by Pitt and Freeman are fighting a war lost in advance, not that much with crime but with the insanity that attacks normal life. They seem to be motivated more by the need of sanity than by the need to enforce law and morals.It's great to watch scenes like the one where the detectives and what seems a regiment of policemen are going out to make a search - it tells a lot about the police system dominating our lives. This is the work of a great director, and with such a director at helm, there is hope that even 'Mission Impossible 3' which he is doing now might be a good film.
Pitt and Freeman are great. Spacey acts just for a few scenes, but that's enough to add his picture to the big actors playing serial killers gallery. Paltrow's role, unfortunately, is too conventional to allow her doing an act comparable to her partners. The final scene is so different from the usual Hollywood ending, that it may shock a lot of viewers. It takes guts to put such an ending to a 'big studios' movie. 9/10 on my personal scale. A great movie, from one of the best directors around.",9,0,0,18 January 2003
Star Trek," rewind on Star Trek
","As everybody is bracing for the second series of the new Star Trek series, I realized this is the right moment to see the first episode which somehow I missed a few years ago. I am a fan of the Star Trek TV series and movies, so there were little chances for me not to like this film. The passing of the torch from Gene Roddenberry who created the original series to J.J. Abrams makes a lot of sense to me, as I see in Abrams the successor of Roddenberry in creating science-fiction which keeps the right balance between science and fiction while adding human and in the best moments philosophical meanings to the action on screen, with an universal message that while the Universe may be infinite and the borders of knowledge just expect to be pushed further and further, the basic values that govern this Universe are the same, whatever form they wear.The story in this first series of Star Trek is a prequel to where the original series started in the 60s. Same as George Lucas did with Star Wars, we are being brought to an earlier phase of the conflict between the Federation and the Romulans, and we get to know all the familiar characters of the original series at an earlier age. Rigorous science was never the strong point of Star Trek, one accepts the conventions in order to enjoy the show, so the space travel as well as hint of alternate universes Abrams likes is used here as well, and it's not necessary to analyze it too closely to find some flaws. What counts is however the way the young actors build their characters and how they drive them towards becoming what we know that they will be in the series that began back in the 60s. The effects around are pretty standard for the space wars kind of movies, and the old tricks like the 'transporter' have kind of a 'retro' look. Here lies actually part of the charm of this film, and this balances to some extent the 'teens on space ships' moments, or even the 'intergalactic sex' scene (yes, there is one, not too explicit, do not worry).The presence of Leonard Nimoy as old Mr. Spock living thanks to some time travel tricks to meet his young self played by Zachary Quinto ensures continuity and connects well with the older TV series. Young captain Kirk is played by Chris Pine and I probably need to wait for the next series to see how he evolves into the character of Kirk as I remember him. A few good actors I know from TV series (Karl Urban, John Cho) add good supporting acting to the cast. Reasonable action combines well with nostalgia, but this combustible is already burnt out completely in the first episode. I hope that the coming series will find something new and interesting that speaks not only to the captive audiences like myself but also to the broader ones who were less exposed to large doses of the older Star Trek series and movies.",6,1,2,29 May 2013
Darkest Hour," roots of leadership
","This season of the Academy Awards has two strong contenders in movies that deal with the events that took place in May and early June 1940. While Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk used the power of the computer effects to retrace the saga of the evacuation of the British army from the beaches of Europe in the first year of WWII, Joe Wright's Darkest Hour takes us in the shady rooms of the politicians and army decision makers who had to make crucial decisions after the disastrous beginning of the war. While the focus in the first movie was on the collective resistance and heroism, the later puts on the first plan the personality of the man who took upon himself the reigns of power in the most difficult moments of the history of the United Kingdom.There is a lot of history in Darkest Hour, part of it facts, some other fiction trying to be true to the spirit of history. 'se non e vero, e ben trovato' - 'Even if it is not true, it is a good story'. The vision created by the authors of the script presents Winston Churchill as a candidate of compromise at a crossroad of the history, who reaches the peak because he is the only politician capable of gathering Labor opposition support for a national unity government. The conservative party and the king himself are very hesitant about his nomination, and much of the first weeks (described in the movie) of his prime-ministry will be faced finessing the attempts to have him replaced by an internal party coup, and fighting to take the kingdom firmly on the path of uncompromising resistance to the Nazi enemy and fierce fight to total victory, in the conditions of the defeat of the allied armies and fall of most of the Western Europe under German occupation. It's a story of political intrigue and the personal story of the controversial politician becoming the leader of the free world at war.Director Joe Wright does in my opinion a very good work in building the story as a political thriller, re-creating to detail the atmosphere of London at war, and bringing to life on screen the characters of the principal players of this historical drama. At some moments he plays with the formats of the frame, we can see the characters and especially Churchill cornered or squeezed to part of the surface of the screen, almost like in two-dimensional paintings, thus creating the sensation of claustrophobia or psychological pressure the heroes find themselves in. Churchill may be one of the most popular historical personalities in cinema, but the absolutely fantastic performance of Gary Oldman brings new angles, as we see the quite old politician and flawed human being transforming himself into a leader with the moral force, political skills and strong convictions not only to lead but also to become a model for his country at war. The rest of the actors team is up to the mission as well, including Kristin Scott Thomas as Winston's supportive wife, Ben Mendelsohn with a nuanced version of King George VI (although his change of mind is not so well explained) and Lily James as his young and devoted secretary.Winston Churchill is not only a popular film hero but he is also claimed as a model for many politicians who came after him, until today, when they try to prove that compromises and appeasement are not the right tactics when faced with enemies perceived as evil. He proved to be on the right side of history more than once, first when fighting the Nazis, later when opposing Communism in Europe. Yes, he was was also a human, he liked whisky and champagne and cigars, but this was not what made him great, but the fact that he fought for the right causes. One of the key scenes in the film shows him taking the underground - for the first time in his life! - and confronting the random sample of people in the train car with the dilemmas he is facing. They unanimously express their support for his own uncompromising positions. The moving scene intents to show that his strength derived from the people's will. It's a little bit romanticized and of course, fictional, but yet, this seems to concentrate the principal message of the film.",8,0,3,31 January 2018
Monster," Monster performances, but a very depressing film
","'Monster' is based on a true story. It brings to screen the character of a serial killer, a prostitute who never had a chance in her life. She tries to find reconciliation in a lesbian love story with a childish runaway, but life, society, men do not give her any chance. In her desperate search for a way out of the nightmare she starts killing her clients. There is a lot of moral debate about her right to take the life of other men, or about the right of the state to take her lifer, but frankly speaking I do not buy too much into such debates, and I found the overall story sordid and depressing. What is really great in this film is the superb acting of the two main characters . Both Charlene Trezon (what a make-up!) and Christina Ricci throw great performances, and they are the main and only reason this film can not only be watched, but also raises interest despite the depressing story and uni-tome message. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",8,0,1,2 October 2004
Memento," A Dry Exercise
","I did not enjoy this film. The idea is smart - an apparent crime story told in a reversive manner. The telling of this story of a guy who forgot his immediate memory, but kept his identity, and seems to be looking for the killer of his wife, the one who triggered 'the incident' - is technically brilliant, but lacks any feeling, and does not produce any emotion in the viewer. At no point in time could I identify with the character, and even if the pieces of the puzzle fit perfectly by the end, the whole story remains a dry, un-emotional technical exercise.",7,1,3,22 June 2002
Inglourious Basterds," don't be mistaken, it's just a Tarantino film
","I think that it is a mistake to judge a film as what it is not.'Inglorious Basterds' is not (just) a war film. It is not a historical film. It is not a film about the Holocaust either. It is a film by Quentin Tarantino. A genre by itself.Tarantino makes entertainment using as starting point different subjects, and develops them his way. One can of course ask whether world war II and the Holocaust can or should be dealt with by films in any genre. I believe that the answer is yes and that this answer was given already many decades ago. The French made I think some of the first comedies about the war (Babette s'en va-t-en guerre with Brigitte Bardot was made in 1960), and later in the past century the Holocaust started to be dealt in various registers, including the comic one, the best example being of course the fabulous 'La vita e bella' by Roberto Begnini.I liked this 'Tarantino goes to war' exercise although I do not think it is his best film. Relative to the the 'Kill Bill' two volumes 'Inglorious Basterds' seems a little bit too simple and too direct. Yet it figures a triangle of characters that are all acted wonderfully - Brad Pitt as the commander of the Jewish avengers squad is almost hard to recognize in voice and appearance, Christoph Waltz is one of the best villains seen on screen in recent times, and Melanie Laurent provides an exotic mix of revenge, ingenuity and femme fatale. The other point of attraction is the use o a cinema hall as the set for an alternate end to the world war - here Tarantino is at his best and the result is unforgettable. This is enough stuff to make of 'Inglorious Basterds' one of the contenders to the Best Film Oscar race especially now that the number of finalists in the category was raised to nine.It will not get the trophy, but it will give a good fight.",8,0,4,16 February 2010
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Good Hollywood Stuff
","This is a classical Hollywood movie. Several books and movies have been lately dedicated to the WWII events in Greece, the Resistance and the 'soft' Italian occupation. This is one of the best. All cliches are in place, but the film is well acted, the story is well told, in a simple and sensible manner, and the landscape of the Greek islands, one of the most beautiful places on Earth, does the rest. Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz are excellent, John Hurt is even better in his role a la Zorba. I did not have too many expectation from this movie, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I will. 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,1,3,28 December 2002
World War Z," saving the world again
","Sometimes you see a film which has great premises and it disappoints. Some other times however a film which according to the subject and taking into account previous experiences in the genre is doomed for failure succeeds to surprise in a good way. This is exactly the case with World War Z directed by Marc Forster starring The Brad Pitt.The human race is in danger and the enemy is inside. It is actually us and our neglect to the environment that causes a destructive virus to take over and spread by means of the global airlines network. In a few days or weeks, the danger cannot be hidden, as the virus turns almost on the spot human beings into zombies with enhanced powers and infinite hunger to bite and infect other human beings, and cities and countries fall one after the other into Z dementia. Only tiny Israel (one of a few movies my country comes with some kind of a positive face) succeeds to delay the fate by isolating itself and building a wall separating healthy people from the world-wide infection, but no wall is high enough to stop such an invasion (hear! hear!).The resulting film is pretty entertaining, although the story is not much different that the one told at least ten if not one hundred times. Director Marc Forster seems to try something else with each of the films he makes, and here his rehabilitation of a genre compromised by too may bad B-series movies succeeds, as he can tell a story and creates a few memorable images like the one of the hysterical zombies pyramids, beings that may have lost humanity but gained social grouping instincts, which had a 'Lord of the Rings' quality. Brad Pitt may seem to be a little bit regressing in his acting career, but as he approaches the mid-age roles time he must have felt happy to act again as the sexy savior of mankind, blessed with both muscles and brains.The word is saved again. The only bad news may be that WWZ 2 is in preparation :-)",7,0,0,7 October 2015
Passengers," an inter-stellar love story
","Spacecraft undertaking long journeys between the stars have become one of the sets favorite movies and television series about the second half of the 60s, with the entry in production of serials like 'Star Trek' and some major big screen movies as '2001: a Space Oddissey' directed by Stanley Kubrick. Smaller and larger studios added to their sets to apartments in Manhattan, wild west villages and saloons or columns of the Roman forums, the corridors and cabins passenger space travel as scenery and props were used and reused. While these sets were diversified, specialized and differentiated by gender, some of them represented true artistic creations, an example being the series 'Alien' with sets drawn by Swiss surrealist artist Hans Rudolph (HR) Giger.'Passengers' directed by Norwegian Morten Tyldum on a screenplay by Jon Spaihts is happening on such a spacecraft called Avalon. (The name comes from the Celtic mythology and Arthurian story exactly, is the name of the island where the legendary sword Excalibur was created). It is a huge shuttle carrying 5000 passengers toward the settlement Homestead II located far away from Earth. What is different from post-apocalyptic movies, we are warned from the beginning that this settlement is the result of a decision taken in an orderly manner and that everything is OK on Earth. In fact, it seems to be a peaceful period in human evolution, without internal conflicts and external threats. So there is room for romance. And in fact, this is what 'Passengers' is - a love story that happens in interstellar space.The journey should last 120 years, and is performed at a cruising speed which is half the speed of light. That means that those who embark on this adventure forever leave their home world, friends and family. Even if taking a return voyage the day after arrival at Homestead II would find upon returning to Earth a humanity oldest 240 years plus time 'compressed' due to travel at speeds comparable to the speed of light (this Conformity theory of relativity) . Achieving such speeds is currently beyond the capabilities of the technology, although known theoretically at least two types of engines (photon propulsion and antimatter) that can be used in the future. Inside the spacecraft imagined by filmmakers combine utilitarianism technical (individual cryogenic cells, a bridge where access is allowed only to the authorized crew, an engine room similar to the engine room ocean liners) and shared space with different sections with comfort differentiated according to social classes . Kind of like a giant Titanic, with a better service and menu afforded only by passengers who have paid the tickets more expensive. That mankind may not have acute internal problems or external conflicts, but the differences between social classes they were not erased this future described by writer 'Passengers'. As a consolation, the bar is still free for all passengers and serviced by an android (played by Michael Sheen) who is a good conversationalist (sometimes a little too chatty) and a gentleman. The exterior of the spacecraft is equipped with a protective shield which should defend the ship, of any meteorological nuisance such as star storms or meteor populated areas. All is well until a problem occurs, and among its consequences, a passenger, a mechanical engineer from Colorado named Jim Preston (actor Chris Pratt is called) is awakened too early. Specifically after 'only' 30 years, 90 years before arriving at their destination, which means in practice that he will never reach there.The love story between the mechanical engineer played by Chriss Pratt and the New York journalist played the beautiful actress Jennifer Lawrence is the centerpiece of the story. It's a story about guilt, because the heroine was actually awakened intentionally by the hero after more than a year and loneliness, which triggers the romantic story but kills the possibility that she ever reaches their destination. I will not reveal more than that and I will not say the connection seemed to me not too convincing despite some scenes filmed very well, and that the last part of the story slips in spatial action drama with not too many original features.I loved in this movie some of the cinematographic images. I saw the movie in 3D, but it should be quite spectacular in 2D as well. Splendid are the scenes inside where a couple of young heroes have at hand a whole (not sinking) Titanic where they are the only ones awake with other 4998 passengers plunged into a deep sleep. Sensational scenes are mostly the one outside the spaceship, where heroes - if we continue the parallel - observe from the deck liner the entire interstellar universe.In conclusion - a more than reasonable science fiction film, a romantic story that takes place in special circumstances and surroundings which may not be that convincing at the end of the day as romance, but the moments of great beauty reward those who undertake the viewing experience.",7,2,4,11 February 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," boring
","POTC-2 is a proof that the best special effects and a selected cast are not enough for a good movie. This film has indeed impressive visuals, and continues the first installment with some of the best (and best paid) actors in the industry. And yet, it cannot help becoming boring and being almost unbearably long, despite its pretensions of being an action film. To be frank, I had a hard time following the action, and worse, I also had the feeling that it did not matter too much. POTC-2 has a story that can be condensed in a few pages of a comics book, but it looks like long and complicated, and repetitive. So yes, I enjoyed the effects, and I like seeing actors like Depp and Bloom and the rest of the crowd in any movie, but this is not enough for a good film, and I think that kids also got a little bored by this movie.Ohm yes, I know, series three is out. Actually it's already on my DVD player and I started to see it.",5,1,2,26 December 2007
Argo," recent history a la Hollywood
","Americans like redoing wars in movies – and they do not avoid the lost wars. The hostage crisis in 1979 which cost president Carter a second presidential mandate was not exactly a war, but a conflict generated by the departing paths of the Iran in revolution after the overthrow of the Shah and on its way to become an Islamic Republic and the United States government which supported for many decades the old regime. One rescue mission went terribly wrong, but this is not the one shown in Argo but the lesser known and successful one in which six employees who escaped the embassy when events started and were hidden in the house of the Canadian ambassador were taken out of Iran, under the false identities of Canadians working for a Hollywood movie. As with the Rambo series for example, the story is first of all a pretext for action entertainment, and a way of making audiences feel better about a problematic episode in the American history. Same as with Rambo, success with audiences and in this case also with critics (which I am a little surprised) was achieved, but this does not make in my opinion for good cinema, and of course does not really change history.Does it matter that the film is inspired by a true story? That's an interesting question, and I would say that the answer is to a large extent No. It is not really the factual truth that matters when you watch a fiction movie, but the artistic news. Reality sometimes exceeds imagination, but art is first of all about imagination, and not necessarily about the imagination of the makers but of the one of the receivers, the viewers in the case of movies. The analysis on the Internet show discrepancies between the real events and the story on screen – this is not what bothers me but the result. The final chase for example between the Iranian police cars and the commercial airplane taking off would fit fine a James Bond or Mission: Impossible film, but not one labeled a true story. There was enough material in the story for a much deeper psychological processing, both of the CIA and other people involved in the plot, and of the American confined in the Canadian ambassador's house and waiting for the rescue. Ben Affleck and the other authors of the film went for the broader audiences using the action film tools and inflating the role of the Hollywood producers and of the Americans in general in the whole story. It was a fair and legitimate choice which probably improved the rating, but did not in my opinion make the film better.I do not like Ben Affleck as an actor. He inspires me dullness in most of the roles he takes, simply made me lose interest in more than a few characters I saw him acting. This is the case here as well. I am not inspired by his Tony Mendez, I cannot distinguish his hero from many other similar action movies heroes, I never got his motivation for making the tough decision of going rogue in order to save lives and accomplish his mission, his divorcée and remote father background is as banal as it can be in the script and Ben Affleck the actor does not pour any life in it. Actually as a director and script author he may be more interesting, his director hand is sure and witty, and as an action movie director he is above average. His image of the 70s is precisely executed, with the help of costumes and sets artists and despite use of stereotypes (like excessive smoking). As with many other of his films Argo promises more than it delivers.",5,17,27,5 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," This Summer's Summer Movie?
","This might be well the summer movie of the year. The audiences at least seem to prefer it to Terminator 3, or Matrix. I saw it a few days after the release here in Israel, and the theater was much more populated than with the previous summer movies, and the reaction of the public was more sympathetic. I think the reason is that the film does not pretend at all to be more than it is - Disney-level entertainment. When you enter a Disney park you leave out any big cultural experience expectation, you get in childhood mood and enjoy the ride. Do the same with 'Pirates', and you may enjoy it. Backed up by some decent acting, and with special effects that will fight for the Oscar with the Terminator stuff, the film is decent entertainment - probably some of best you can expect from the US studios this summer. 7/10 on my personal scale.",7,0,1,10 August 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," the thrill is gone
","J.J. Abrams uses in 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' the prequels formula Reversing the effects of present-past and discovering the causes of the effects we have known in advance have paved the interest for many films. In the first film we already met Captain James T. Kirk as a young rebel, Mr. Spock who already has all the traits of his humano-volcanic character, while doctor Chekhov and technician Scotty play an important role in the plot the second series.The world is again in danger in this series and the main villain Benedict Cumberbatch is played masterfully by an actor that I like enormously and in this film manages to be a 'bad guy' of high quality. Themes popular in the 'Star Trek' series like the moral dilemmas between friendship and duty, love between humans and humanoids from other species of the universe, the principle of non-intervention in exploration, namely the avoidance of disruption of the historical evolution of less developed civilizations, are added to a contemporary theme in this film - that of terrorism. The HQ of the Federation Council which extends the UN replacing or in some way by the Organization of United Civilizations is the victim of a terrorist attack in London of the future, and hence complicates the start and the multiple threads of the main action in the film.What is probably to be criticized in J.J. Abrams and the producers work in this second series 'Star Trek' is the fact that space action is given undue overweight. It is natural for a science fiction film made in 2013 to look very different than a television series conceived in the mid 60s. Cinematic technology progressed, taste of a public that has seen so many in nearly half a century of films changed. Yet it seemed to me that the filmmakers have chosen the superficial entertainment path and personally I missed the thrill of exploring knowledge and that was evident in many of the Star Trek TV series and movies from the past. The focus is too much on graphics (exceptional, actually), the image of the future metropolis, the space battles and chases occupying about half the film. This Star Trek's J.J. Abrams looks too much like Star Wars. Technology of the future imagined by Abrams brings little additional elements to what we knew from previous series - 'transporters', communication systems etc. we are familiar with these, with the sole exception of the levitation beds in hospitals. The atmosphere of 'Star Trek' is found rather in small dialogs between characters who continue to build and define the next generation and become familiar to the public. It is probably one of the reasons the film's success and a good premise for the series that will follow.The journey continues, but the pace is hesitant, and the thrill is gone. Hopefully, only temporarily.",6,2,5,3 June 2015
Hostel," efficient but not easy too watch
","'Hostel' directed by Eli Roth and produced and introduced by Quentin Tarantino is not easy too watch. It's a horror movie about a group of teens traveling to Eastern Europe whose trip for fun and sex turns in a trip of horror, when they fall victims to a gang of who attract tourists into becoming victims of a sadistic torture_per_pay theater. The difference between other many movies of the genre is that the introduction that looks much like a American_teen_trip_to_Europe film develops gradually in what seems to be a very realistic rendition of the post-Communist Easter Europe turned into a big circus of horror. The setting is much more realistic and credible than in the classic American movies of the genre, and the resulting violence and torture scenes exceed the usual limits. The film is well made and well acted, but while you admire the directors and actors skills you just with that they were spent into making some more entertaining, easier to watch and meaningful movie.",8,12,18,29 July 2006
Public Enemies," Michael Mann takes on Dillinger
","The gangster movies are by now one of the most well-established film genres. Born in the American reality of the 20s and 30s, as time passes they slowly become a genre that expands internationally and also reflects much about the times the films are made besides and they do so while retelling stories that have already become history and bringing to screen characters that have become legend.So is Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies'. One interesting aspect this film raises is the relation between popular culture - especially cinema - and the real lives of the 30s gangsters. Before becoming heroes on screen these bad guys were inspired in their deeds by heroes on screen. A scene in 'Public Enemies' close to the final shows Dillinger (acted by Johnny Depp) taking inspiration from a screen criminal acted by Clark Gable. Earlier we see the mobsters meeting in cinema theaters, watching newsreels and cartoons, and also playing with the press a public relation game that was much part of their ego and also of their fight for survival.'Public Enemies' goes far in researching the epoch, using original settings, fitting the wardrobe, weapons or music to the time it describes. From this point of view the achievement is remarkable, and it's one of the reasons the film almost never loses the grip on its viewers, despite the two hours and twenty minutes of screening which seems to have become almost standard in Hollywood lately. Well documented is also the story of the formation of the institutions that are fighting crime nation-wide as well as the relations between the bank robbers and the emerging organized crime institutions of the time. What is missing from the film is the psychological justification of the behavior of the characters. Dillinger and his friends, super-cops Hoover and Purvis (acted by Christian Bale) are just what they are - gangsters and cops, bad guys and good guys, and director Mann seems to tell us to take them as a given. A couple of lines tell something about Dillinger's unhappy childhood, mother died young, abusing father, and that's it - an average guy with great talent for organization falls on the bad side of law and life. His romantic interest with Billie Frechette (French actress Marion Cotillard, deserving a much better role) is also average, and gets a tragic nuance only in the context of Dillinger never being able to fulfill his promise to protect her - from what? from himself actually. We learn even less, actually nothing about what made tick cop Purvis in risking his life to become a chief mob fighter.Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are two formidable actors and they give both memorable performances here. Depp looks bad dangerous and dangerous any moment on screen, he is also charismatic and unfulfilled. His bravura seems to hide uncertainty, his thrive of living today is determined by the knowing that there will not be many tomorrows for him. Bale is entering his character as he always seems to do in the movie she acts in, up to the feeling that he lives the lives of his heroes. The rest of the cast is OK, but the lead performances being that strong it looks like all the other are gravitating around the two.In a period of crisis, with many contemporaries of ours questioning the systems that govern our lives characters like Dillinger exercise fascination. They were public enemies, enemies of the system of their time, fighting it their way. Yet, they were evil, robbing banks is not the solution for anything, same as the nowadays corrupt financial schemes are not a solution for anything. Showing the real life of such characters that became popular heroes of some kind may help in understanding this message.",7,0,1,5 September 2009
The Girl Next Door," not even a little bit funny
","In one of the scenes that pretends to be funny in this film the main male character is punished to run naked after the car drove by the main female character. 'It's not funny' he complains. 'It's a little bit funny' she answers. Talking about the film, he is the one to be right!'The Girl Next Door' is an unpleasant mix of teenage comedy, moralizing story and social comment about the porn industry. It takes a good director to mix these themes in a good film, and this movie did not get one. The script bares much guilt as it is never comic enough, sharp enough, crazy enough or credible enough to have the viewer path the threshold of 'so what'?'. Acting does not help either. We never get to care about the characters, they do not succeed to make us love or hate them. I liked Elisha Cuthberg in '24' - one of the best series of the latest years in American TV - but she does not hold the capabilities or she did not enjoy the hand of a good director to turn the role into something to remember. All male teen actors are directed in a way that makes them look unfit for life and screen. The better acted parts are the two supporting roles of the porn moguls, but this is not enough.'Euro-Trip' proved this year that there is a chance for the teenage comedy genre. With 'Girl Next Door' we are back to the moralistic view of the world. Trying to sell the 'human side' of the pornography world in a teenage comedy with 'moral fiber' (another quote from the film) takes much more talent. This film lacks it. 4 out of 10 on my personal scale.",4,0,2,10 September 2004
Oldboy," giving Tatantino a run for his money
","Amazing film. I visited Korea for the first time this year. As the country, Korean films are different from what you have seen and what you have experienced from a Western perspective. This movie has a subject that starts like a Kafka story of an individual facing an unknown repressive machine, but turns quickly in a sordid and personal revenge run that would be worth of the hand of Tarantino. I am sorry to use Western cultural references, but this is the best way to describe my impressions. There is actually much more deepness, a troubling, shocking but yet so human story beyond the action story line. There are tons of graphic violence and some sex, but they did not seem shocking to me because they were very much in the logic of the story. Acting is superb, and the story line, including the ending is perfectly logic. I am hearing that Hollywood intents to do a re-make and I fear the results. But maybe they can convince Tarantino himself to do it! One of the best films of the year to end, 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",9,32,120,17 December 2004
Spider-Man 2," A good movie from an unexpected source
","'Spider-man 2', while caching all that money summer blockbusters make succeeds to rally unexpected fans, while drawing critics from the usual audience which one would expect to be happy to see one of their preferred products. The IMDB viewers column is full of comments from good cinema fans pleasantly surprised by the movie, while comics movies fans complain about plot holes and  too much emotional stuff. I belong to the first category, and I do not regret having been dragged into the cinema theater by my teenager son. Besides the air-conditioning on a 40 centigrades afternoon, I really enjoyed the plot, which had logic - human and emotional logic for a change, the action scenes, which made sense, were clear and not confusing, and the fact that I saw the main character  facing a credible human vs. hero dilemma. BTW, the theme of incompatibility between the super-hero status and human emotions is a classical theme, from ancient legends, through many other literature works - but we are not here for an art history lesson, are we? Certainly, the film would have been better without the last five syrup minutes, but overall 'SP-man 2' is a proof that there are no forbidden genres, and that a good director in a season of inspiration can turn almost any material into real cinema. I am no fan of Tobey Maguire, and I did not become one after having seen the movie. Kirsten Dunst is better in the role of the love interest of the hero, and I will keep watching her, as well as the rest of the feminine crowd in 'Mona Lisa Smile', which kind of defines the new generation of actresses in the US cinema. Best act comes from Alfred Molina in the bad guy supporting role. Good cinema lovers, you deserve a break from time to time from 'serious' movies. Take this one for a relaxing, but still decent cinema experience. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",8,0,0,25 July 2004
The Secret in Their Eyes," a telenovela gets the Oscar?
","There is no 'bad' genre in cinema or literature or music I believe. There are just good films and bad films, good books and bad books, good pieces of music and bad pieces of music. So, saying that with 'El secreto de sus ojos' the Academy gave this year the Oscar prize for the best foreign language movie to a telenovela (soap opera) - a genre so popular all over the world which has a special flavor in South America and especially in Argentina - should not by any means be taken as an insult.The story line of 'El secreto de sus ojos' crosses a quarter of a century which for Argentina meant huge convulsions and transformation from the populist demagogy of the rule of the Perons in the 70s, through the brutal military right wing dictatorship at the end of that decade and the beginning of the 80s, until the full restoration of the democracy by the end of the century. It is a complex story, involving a brutal rape and murder which is being investigated by a criminal judge which tries to bring justice at all means, in a system that seems to be corrupt and incapacitated whatever the political system of the day. he story of passion allows the authors to make a deep and convincing reflection about the relativity of justice when faced with political and human weakness. However, beyond the satisfying thriller story it is the unconsumed love story between the investigator Benjamin Esposito and his superior, judge Irene Menendez Hastings that eventually takes over. This apparently impossible love, because of professional and social circumstances, gives the whole film an air of melancholy, and Soledad Vilamil as the judge is a fascinating screen presence, of an ageless and noble beauty that reminded that shines through the whole duration of the film and gives it the deserved title. Her partner Ricardo Darin seems a little too restrained, it is exactly the passion that never changes in a man which is once referred in a key scene that seems to lack to the actor.Many of the elements remind indeed the telenovelas - the development of the action, the parallel threads, the romantic tone. There are however some differences, some in favor of the movie, other against it. There is no violin sentimental music score. There are moments of great quality in the scenes of the 70s representing bars or house interiors or the stadium, the viewer can not only visualize, but also hear, feel and the smell the period. Beyond the principal actress there is at least one more exquisite supporting performance of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval, the drunken, pathetic, and eventually heroic partner of Benjamin. Yet there is not enough time to develop all the subjects. The film at 127 minutes is too short for all threads to develop completely, the authors seem to have intended to say too much and had not enough time and space to extend, ans the result is that the dictatorship period seems to be treated in a quite superficial manner, and the story has two endings - one for the thriller and justice story, the other for the romantic thread, which do not really come together.'El secreto de sus ojos' is not a bad film, quite the contrary. Having however seen two other of the films that competed for the Oscar this year, Haneke's 'Das weisse bad' and the Israeli 'Ajami' - I personally would not have been surprised or upset at all if any of these other two had won and not this one.",7,3,17,16 May 2010
The Irishman," an American History
","With 'The Irishman' Martin Scorsese makes an explicit statement that he considers his illustrious career as a director and a producer to be far from final. Besides, Scorsese is not only at the fourth feature film in this decade (plus some musical documentaries, another passion of his), but he is working deep in pre-production phases in two other films that promise to be events in the coming years.'The Irishman' is an interesting combination. It's a film about the mob, a genre in which where Scorsese has already offered us memorable movies like 'Mean Streets', 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino'. The director does not hesitate to leave the big studios in Hollywood and works with the new channels of film production and streaming distribution, specifically with Netflix. He uses computer graphics - he already has done it in 'Hugo' but here it uses a process of 'rejuvenating' the actors in a story that spans the whole second half of the 20th century. Most than all he brings back together the great actors who are Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, along with other well known actors such as Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel, all (as Scorsese) in the second half of the eighth decade of their lives. They are all happy to prove that they are still here, and that they can add memorable roles to their already impressive records.Frank Sheeran, the hero of the movie, the Irishman in the title is a real character in the histories of the trade union movement and of the American mob of the second half of the 20th century. Inspired by a 'true story' book, the film can be regarded as a docu-drama. Sheeran (played by Robert De Niro) lives the last months of his life in 2003, on a wheelchair in a retirement house and tells his biography - from a truck driver transporting meat to the slaughterhouses in Chicago to leader union and paid killer for the Mafia. Scorsese builds a specific American historical drama here, but he also takes a place in the series of directors who rewrote on screen the modern history of America, such as Oliver Stone did in 'JFK' or Robert Zemeckis in 'Forrest Gump'. We can see on the screen a gallery of more or less well-known historical figures, from union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) to mafia bosses and their corrupt lawyers. Most of them are introduced with the date and reason of death, and none died in his bed. For American viewers this gallery probably speaks a lot, but for those less familiar with the history of American organized crime, the character lineup becomes at some point repetitive and we do not differentiate them from each other, at best through the actors who interpret them.The pleasure of seeing De Niro, Pacino and those around them on screen is one of the reasons why I was nailed in the chair for three and a half hours. The atmosphere of the '50s,' 60s, '70s and the blood-stained kitch in witch the mob chiefs lived are very well rendered. The process of 'rejuvenating' the characters using CGI technologies, however, works only partially in my opinion. Its use may bring some technical prizes to the Academy, but neither De Niro's Sheeran nor Pacino's Hoffa seemed credible and authentic to me in the scenes in which we have to believe they were of age. 30 or 40 years. There is still work left in this area.I don't think that 'The Irishman' is the last of the great mob films in American cinema. The genre is already well-rooted, and as with westerns I believe that it will continue to give birth to new productions and variations in the future. The combination with the genre of docu-drama works well, and the film, without being a masterpiece, is a solid and interesting creation from many points of view. A film that shows Scorsese refuses to grow old and for good reasons.",8,3,9,10 December 2019
Black Book," imperfect justice
","Paul Verhoeven and Quentin Tarantino belong to a separate category of directors. Their films loaded with violence and in the case of Verhoeven and eroticism, both explicit and extreme to the conventional tastes, risk calculated and intentionally attracting the public for the wrong reasons. Paul Verhoeven's 'Zwartboek' ('Black Book' or 'Black Book') from 2006 is in many ways similar to 'Inglourious Basterds' which Tarantino brought to the screens in 2009. Both films are approaching the final period of -the Second World War in a very different way from other films dealing with this war, the Resistance, and the Holocaust. The two films copiously use elements from the spy and action movie kit to tackle a theme where there apparently wouldn't be much room for an entertainment atmosphere. In addition, both films use the entertainment vehicle to bring to light less-known and less-accepted aspects, some very uncomfortable, about those spent in that troubled historical period.The story takes place in the last year of WWII in the occupied Netherlands, a period during which the mass deportations of Jews by the Nazis and their local accomplices took place. Rachel Stein, the main heroine of the film (played by the attractive and talented Carice van Houten ), a young and beautiful Jewish singer, sees the Dutch family hiding her killed, and then her entire family slaughtered in an attempt to save themselves by fleeing to liberated Belgium. Obliged to remain in the Netherlands, she joins a Resistance group. Receiving the mission to infiltrate the German command in The Hague, she meets the Gestapo chief, discovers that he is more human than many of his subordinates and falls in love with him. This relationship is just one of the less believable elements of a plot that is about as realistic as a James Bond movie script. The non-credible love story between the Jewish survivor and resistant and the Gestapo chief cannot end well, and after the end of the war, Rachel (or Ellis in her assumed identity) is suspected of treason and accused of collaboration with the Nazis. The end of the war does not mean justice for all criminals or relief for all their victims. All will end well, somehow, for those who will survive.145 minutes of screening pass quickly for action movies fans. From a visual point of view 'Black Book' often looks like a Hitchcock movie, except that the element of psychological terror adds a lot of explicit violence plus the dose of eroticism characteristic to most of Verhoeven's films. But these should not distract attention from a few unique elements. History is not at all embellished in this movie. Jews trying to save their lives buy their freedom with money, jewelry and gold bars. The help received from others is not always disinterested, and Jews are often robbed and betrayed. The members of the Resistance are not presented strictly under a heroic light, there are also traitors among them, they are divided by ideological and religious conflicts. Not all Germans in the movie are 'bad guys' and not all Dutch are 'good guys'. The post-Liberation justice is far from impartial, and the behavior of the victors towards those suspected of collaboration is as violent and humiliating as the one of the Nazis, even if it is adorned with national colored flags. 'Black Book' was the returning home movie of Verhoeven after a two decades career in Hollywood. The film was well received despite its critical aspects. Verhoeven's style is visible not only in the visual treatment and the commercial cinematographic elements, but also in the extreme ambiguity of some of the situations. As for many of his films, from 'Black Book' we will later remember the controversies.",7,0,2,16 October 2019
Alexander," not the best historical epic
","It is hard to understand Oliver Stone's choices. The gifted director who made probably one of the best Vietnam war movies, the intriguing director of 'The Hand' and 'Natural Born Killers', even the programmatic director of 'JFK', and now this? 'Alexander' looks too much like a big studios historical epics of the 60s, but this is no 60s any longer, and without daring to say loudly what is different 'Alexander' fails on almost any plan.There are certainly a few different ideas in the script. One of them is a modern interpretation of the story of Alexander, with some contemporary implications. This part fails, mostly because it does not find any credible translation in cinema language. Being left with commentaries about 'guerilla war' in the mouth of 4th century BC characters cannot make a credible case. Another theme is about the ambiguous sexual orientation of Alexander. As legends whistle the story for milennia, as books throw the rumors of his homo-sexuality to footnotes, so does Stone, probably as result of Hollywood puritan politics, and here is the source of another failure. What we are left is with an inversion of focus, with Alexander's mother becoming sort of central or at least driving character in his life's story, and here we must give credit to Angelina Jolie for succeeding to play a powerful and dominant mother role, with the exception of the funny accent which only Stone and her hold the secret (maybe).There is too little good cinema in this film, and too much off-screen commentary and theater dialogs. Only for a few moments like in the flash-back re-creating Alexander's father assassination are we reminded what a fine director Stone was and maybe will be. 'Alexander' however, will be missing from the list of his best movies.",5,0,0,12 October 2005
Constantine," good cinema work, despite ridiculous premises

Troy," Exactly what I expected
","'Troy' is exactly what I expected. A big screen historic epics, taking a lot of licenses relative to the classic story, re-creating the ancient times via the perspective of the modern American cinema viewer. Some of the characters behave just like Western heroes, some other quote classic text while behaving more like contemporary American politicians or Afghan war-lords. Directing is quite straight-forward, the story is told well, acting is good - especially Peter O'Toole which is a pleasure to see again in a historic role after all these years. It is not art, and if you do not expect anything serious like Greek tragedy and you take it for what it is - popular entertainment - you can enjoy the fights and effects. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7,3,6,6 November 2004
Brokeback Mountain," just mediocre cinema
","I really do not understand what is the big deal. If this film was not about a gay relationship and if it was not for the controversy that the theme created nobody would have paid attention at best, or would have wondered why such a fine director as Lee or a fine actor as Jake Gyllenhaal became involved with such an average minus film.The story is of a forbidden love as homosexual love is still a taboo from a moral point of view in the US, especially in the conservative mid-West. Yet, it is not an interesting love story, the heroes do not have chemistry, and what looks like an average work and boys relationship suddenly becomes a physical relationship out of the blue and then turns into or the director wants to make us believe that it turns into a relationship. The problem is that nothing int he story justifies this, excepting a vague memory of one of the heroes about his father condemning such relations. So what? Then, the heroes try to get 'normal' lives, which of course are filmed in a banal and boring environment compared to the pure natural environment of Mount Brokeback where the 'love story'happens. Come on, this is a cheap trick! The rest is just soap opera, nicely filmed, well acted by Jake Gyllenhaal especially who hardly can do something wrong, but this is no more than just this - soap opera. The last 15-20 minutes are completely worthless, the authors even ran out of a story.I do not see the value of this film. I saw much better films in this genre like 'My Beautiful Laundrette' for example. In my opinion after the politically correct atmosphere disperses the film will be relegated to the gay relationships films niche.",4,3,27,23 August 2007
Ed Wood," great film about the 'worst director ever'
","One of the best thing Hollywood makes is films about Hollywood. Some may judge these movies like kind of acts of self-adulation, but the fact is that films dedicated to films making and even homage films about past stars and directors resulted into many remarkable creations from the classical Sunset Boulevard to recent films like Hitchcock to remember just the one recent film in the genre I happen to remember now. These films have in common a dose of nostalgia for the times past and a lot of respect for the creators who preceded them. Even when they contain a dose of critical nuances or they describe disputable characters in the history of American film making like is the case with Tim Burton's Ed Wood they still carry a dose of reverence and fraternity across the generation. All this is very visible in this film of Burton which is almost hard to believe that was made 20 years ago, so fresh and contemporary it looks. In Burton's filmography it may be one of the less 'rebelious' movies, yet it contains its dose of inventiveness and the sure mastering the skills of film making.Ed Wood (the real character) was - arguably - the 'worst director' in the history of film-making. There are certainly many great contenders to Wood for this title. Most of the IMDb ratings for his movies range between 3 and 4, with a deep dive to 2.2 and a stellar 6.2 for one of his latest films. Yet Burton's film shows him as a man of passion, and a fighter with the system and the big studios sharks (BTW - I am waiting for a great film about Hollywood producers!). One of the scenes to remember in the film is the one of the meeting of Wood with Orson Welles. The (problematic) message of the scene is that all directors - genius or trash - had to fight the same problems and the same system. The difference between them is of course that one had a huge talent, the other had just a daring character and a charming personality that allows us to sympathize with him while he is following and partly achieving his dream of creating trash on screens.It does help of course that the lead role is played by Johnny Depp, the permanent fetish leading star of Burton. He is rendering the character of Wood in its whole complexity, oddity, tenacity and charm. It is however the splendid re-enacting of Bela Lugosi by Martin Landau that caught my full attention. A great star of the horror-fantasy movies of the 30s, Bela Lugosi was all but forgotten, in poverty and sunk in drug addiction when Ed Wood re-discovered him in the 50s and allowed him a few last presences in his films. Ed Wood the movie is to a large extent the story of the friendship between the two men. Filming in black and white also gives style and quality to the film, and reminds us that The Artist may have rediscovered the silent film, but not the black and white movies. If Ed Wood did not create any quality on screen during his activity in Hollywood he has at least inspired a film which is much better than anything he made as a director.",9,0,0,18 January 2014
Spotlight," requiem for true journalism
","Director Tom McCarthy authored a very interesting first film in 2003 (The Station Agent) and then his career seemed to go adrift into 'OK movies'. Now he hits gold with Spotlight which does not differ much in directing style from his other films, but just gathers a number of very favorable factors into proving that you can get a Best Film Academy Award even taking the 'OK approach' (in a 'dry' year as 2015 was).Let me start with the positive things, and there are many of these. One first condition to hit gold at the Academy Awards is to run one of those big American stories, that play well with the concepts and heroes of the nation. Investigative journalism and people who make the news are the main theme and the heroes of the film, and on this respect 'Spotlight' follows a tradition that starts with 'Citizen Kane' and continues with films like All President's Men and Zodiac. The story that is investigated by the 'Boston Globe' 'Spotlight' team in the movie is the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests and the cover-up of the phenomenon and of its dimensions by the Church institutions but also by the town authorities, judicial system, community leaders. It's an explosive subject which to some extent continues until today. The 'based on real events' factor works well here because we know that the implications and ramifications of the problem continue until today. The writers and producers of this film chose to use the real names and tried to remake the true story as close as possible to the facts, places, characters.The other strong attribute of this film is the accurate rendition of the 'yesterday' atmosphere to the smallest detail. The story happens between 2000 and 2002, this was so close and yet so far from many points of view. Acting is also very precise, although the homogeneity of the team makes the characters indistinguishable from a moral stand point of view. It's like I missed an element of hesitation, of fear of consequences - the story looks not like what it happened but like the way the heroes told the world it happened. Sure, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Liev Schreiber do all fine jobs, and I also liked how many of the supporting actors entered into their smaller parts.I do not believe however that 'Spotlight' would have won the Best Film Award in another year. It lacks the sparkle that make the big movies we remember over the years. It may also be the last important movie in his genre. As printed journalism melts down and the multi-channel TV news and the Internet take over, the public relies less and less on this kind of journalism. People have easy access to much more information, they can change easily allegiance to any channel of news on TV or Internet, they need to make the choices by themselves. 'Spotlight' may be the cinematographic requiem for the kind of journalism it describes.",9,0,1,7 May 2016
Insomnia," Won't Let You Sleep
","This strong psychological thriller drama will not let you sleep. It is intelligent, well-acted and well directed. No wonder that this is a re-make of an European film - they do too little good scripts in Hollywood nowadays. The European public is much more connected to literature, and the lack of big apes and aliens encourages script-writers in Europe to focus more on humans.Acting is superb. Al Pacino is playing a deprived of sleep Columbo, with the emotional depth of a master. Robin Williams decided to break his stereotypes casting of the last years, and the decision seems to be already paying back. I expect more wonderful roles from him soon.The director Christopher Nolan takes a bet by picking a less revolutionary script than in his previous film 'Memento'. He succeeds and I actually liked 'Insomnia' more than 'Memento' - probably human feelings are easier to understand when run in the normal chronological order. It is hard to believe that he is only at his third film, he always has the self-confidence and sure hand of a master. As the titles of his films are all in the Hitchcock tradition, the comparison to the 'Birds' author is striking, and I really hope that the future will prove it as well-deserved.",8,0,0,2 November 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," bad cinema
","Reading the IMDB Message Board with the comments and reactions of viewers is much more interesting than the film itself. I usually know what to expect when I go to a disaster movie, so I bought my popcorn and entered the theater to see the big effects, not some cinema masterpiece. I must say that I was still very disappointed. After reading all the press articles, and seeing the TV clips, there was no surprise for me in the subject. If you saw the trailers then you saw all the good effects - the rest is quite un-impressive relative to the money that must have been invested. When it is not un-impressive it is really bad - in a couple of instances, you saw actors running off and escaping a huge tidal wave, and the glacial age (yes!) - this was so un-believable. Acting is average minus, although Emmy Rossum and Jake Gyllenhaal have the potential to become big stars. The scientific premises - not of the movie - but of some of the effects like the extreme cooling are so unbelievable and defying the logic, that they look extreme even in Hollywood terms. There is some more truth in details of the script, in the human father-to-son relationship, or in some surprisingly funny ideas like having US refugees flying the Mexican border southbound in some kind of reverse historic irony, but then all falls back and is swollen in flat and bad dialog. The only good thing that will come out of this movie is the theme park ride which may already be in building some place. The grim warning about our future if we ignore ecology deserves a better movie. This one gets 4 out of 10 on my personal scale.",4,0,1,6 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," too much, too long, so boring
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' series is a demonstration that not every good idea should be turned into a three series epic. Sure, the series were commercially successful, but the result was not at all satisfying on my taste. What started as a good epic, with with a great key idea, with a charming mix of history, legends and humor filmed in exotic places continued in the second and third installment with more and more visual effects, but the story simply was not here. More characters showed up in an attempt to create a sea and pirates mythology, rules of life and death were broken freely, so by the end almost every character seems to have died at least once, but a clear line of conflict is completely missing, and that the result is very difficult to follow. Actually even if you follow it I have the impression that it does not really help, because at the end it is not clear what the big conflict is about. The whole series 3 is built to prepare a battle magnificently filmed and computer-simulated, but what are they really fighting for? The film deserves Oscars in a few technical categories, but none in the art ones. I was tired and bored at the end of the film, and I am happy to not hear news about series 4.",5,2,3,27 December 2007
Don Jon," addiction and cure
","Sometimes I feel sorry for not liking a movie. It usually happens when I see tones of good intentions and talent put into a film, and yet the result is a disaster, or very far below the expectations. This is the case with this film written, directed and acted by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. If one looks at the cinematographic record of this 32-years young man he will see 63 movies on his acting record, 6 entries as a director and only 2 as a writer. These numbers actually tell the story of why 'Don Jon' is such a failure (IMHO of course).Don Jon has in my eyes the most unbelievable and PC-twisted story that I have seen lately. Jon (J.G.-L. himself acting) is a blue collar (way of saying, we never know what his work is) young guy from New Jersey. His life is as empty in content as any life of a hero from New Jersey seems to be in movies - he works, goes to the gym, drives as crazy to church on Sundays, then confesses the sins of the previous week to the priest, and begins sinning again. At night he hangs out in discos with his friends, chases girl, beds a number of them - not in the low numbers, and they are all good looking. Did I say he is good looking too? There is only one problem - he is also a porn addict. After having sex with women, he sneaks out of the bed to watch porn! Even when he meets 'the most beautiful thing in the world' (Barbara - Scarlett Johansson) and falls in love with her he cannot give up his habit. Which of course, endangers the relationship. Well, losers and twisted minds exist, and they make movies about them, some are good. The problem is that in this story the script decided that vice needs a cure, and the cure comes under the face of a much older woman (Julianne Moore) who teaches him a great secret - well, I will not tell more, just that this seems so conventional that it is really ridiculous.Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt is actually a perfect fit for the role, and Scarlett Johansson succeeds to bring to life the emptiness behind the physical beauty of a 'suburb princess'. Julianne Moore is a fine actress, but unfortunately she fails to convince and lacks the magnetism necessary to make the 'cure' credible. It was also great to see again Tony Danza of 'Who's the Boss' fame as Jon's father (or Jon's variant 25 years later). Director Joseph Gordon-Levitt has some interesting ideas, although I am not crazy about the trend of using video clips techniques in a repetitive manner in feature movies like this one. Unfortunately neither the actors (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt), nor the director Joseph Gordon-Levitt could compensate the flaws of the script written by writer Joseph Gordon-Levitt. From my point of view his only success with 'Don Jon' is to have made the first film with Scarlett Johansson that I did not like.",4,2,9,23 November 2013
Midnight in Paris," a song of love for the city of magics
","There is no better way to see this wonderful film of Woody Allen than in an art cinema on the Rive Gauche, then go out and just wonder through the streets of the city. Some miracle will happen, even if it may not be identical to the one happening to the hero in the movie. Miracles are not supposed to be identical any way, are they? Gil, the hero of the movie is a script-writer at Hollywood, successful enough not to care about being in love with the wrong girl, successful enough not to care to walk away from her and her corporate magnate daddy when he realizes what we all know from the first scene - she is not up to him, to his artistic and human aspirations, to his dreams to become a real writer and maybe live in Paris like Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway did in the golden 20s and 30s of the previous century. So when magic happens and a classic Citroen picks him at midnight to meet his idols and Picasso, and Dali (Adrien Brody) and Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and the lovely Adriana (Marion Cotillard), un-famous muse to Picasso and Modigliani and interest of love for the 21st century Gil and maybe for other 19th century artists nobody is too astonished. We are not because Woody Allen tells the story with the fluidity of the feelings and sentiments rather than caring for any rational or mechanical explanation, and the hero is not because his idols behave exactly as they are described in text books. Is our representation of the past more a collection of clichÃ©s than a true representation of what really was? This is one of the more serious questions triggered by the film only after the viewers quit the screening theater. Is everybody more or less unhappy with his own present and seeking the refuge in a Golden Age which looked close proves not to be as shining as from the perspective of history, certainly not for those who live it as present?The charm of the movie and its omnipresent element of continuity is provided by the presence of the city for which 'Midnight in Paris' is a love declaration. The film starts with a series of postcard or touristic shots in the city, just to fill them with content and flavor. In Allen's view in this film Paris is the kingdom beyond the mirror. The didactic message may be as obvious as ever in Allen's films and is even enhanced by the off-screen voice which sounds like Allen's whoever is the actor that plays the story teller - Allen himself or somebody else. For Paris lovers this is the song that they always wanted to hear. The rest are in danger to become Paris lovers after seeing this film.",9,1,5,12 June 2011
Youth," 'Youth; is about being Old
","Is the fact that I immensely liked 'Youth' a sign that I am getting old? I can tell you (and I will tell you) a few good reasons 'Youth' is not a masterpiece, and yet, I resonated and was really moved at several moments while watching this film.Take for example the scene when the emissary of Her Majesty comes for a second time to invite retired composer and conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) to perform at the anniversary of Prince Phillip a famous composition of his called 'Simple Songs' ('it's the only music he likes'). The daughter of the musician, Lena (Rachel Weisz) is present and the camera moves so that she turns from background to close-up. We will understand the scene by her emotions. The old musician has refused firmly the invitation 'for personal reasons'. The emissary royally insists and asks details about the reasons. The daughter understands, she is on the verge of breaking into tears. The old man answers 'my wife is the only one who was performing it perfectly and she cannot do it any longer'. Close up on the daughter crying. One of the most beautiful declarations of love that I have seen on screens for many years.The location of the story is a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps, a place of relaxation and recovery for the ultra-riches of the world. Some of the scenes that describe the daily life of the place look like a tourism promo, but there is enough irony to balance the super-aesthetic view. In the mid of the hinted celebrities, in between a cinema star that can be a Matt Daemon or a Leonardo DiCaprio refueling and a Maradona at the pick of his overweight decline, we meet the two old friends - the musician and film director Harvey Keitel who tries to find an ending to his 'testament movie' together with a team of yuppies script-writers. The two share memories - remembered and forgotten - as well as an attitude that tries to cope with their own personal decay. Is this a symbol of a broader decay, the one of the society they come from, the falling in oblivion of a way of life, but also of a way of making art and relating to art? This is one of the possible messages that I read in this film.The acting of the two old masters - Caine and Keitel is superb. Jane Fonda makes one apparition that is worth waiting for. There are a lot of funny moments in this film, there is melodrama, and real drama. A feeling of melancholy envelops all the story, the same type of melancholy that I sensed in The Great Beauty (which I liked less) and to some extent in This Must Be the Place which was one of the most original Holocaust stories that I have seen. Overall, 'Beauty' confirms the huge talent of Paolo Sorrentino in making films with emotional stories and characters that are both special and sometimes eccentric, but also deeply human.",9,0,1,22 June 2016
Zodiac," way too long, and yet interesting
","Something interesting happened while I was watching 'Zodiac'. I am not a big fan of the 'true crime stories' genre, and this film suffers from the 150+ minutes disease which seems to have spread widely in Hollywood. By the end of the first 30 minutes I was lost in the many details of the Zodiac serial killer case, and 30 minutes later I was on the verge of falling asleep, after all this is the maximum duration I can hold on similar themed TV series, and then I usually go to bed.It is not that it is not a well made film. I was amazed to read comments from viewers and critics about David Fincher having made a 'regular' movie. Maybe the subject seems to be so, but the cinema work is sophisticated - as we advance from the late 60s to the 80s the digital camera reconstitutes the light, the clarity, and the palette of colors of the films of that time. So subtle that it neighbors geniality.Yet the detective story is the weak part of the movie. Trying to be true to facts, it does not create enough tension, details accumulate and blur one another, and taking into account that most of the viewers know the story they are simply not enough interesting for more than half of the movie.An then something happens. You realize that the movie is no longer about the crime or the criminal, we know all that is worth knowing about those, but about the men trying to find the truth and about the obsession that brings them on the verge of the destruction of their families or even self destruction. Acting certainly helps, with Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. each giving such a top performance that the next year Acadmy nominating committee will have a hard time choosing whom to bring to the big evening in L.A. Seeing Jake Gyllenhaal for example I had a flashback three decades back with Richard Dreyfuss building mountains in his living room to prepare the close encounter. One can say that this film is much too long, so long that it ends by being interesting.",7,1,2,28 June 2007
The Prestige," good, but slightly over-rated
","By now we know that the unexpected would be for Christopher Nolan to make an expected film. Yet, 'The Prestige' is to some extend the most expected film of Nolan until now. It is an adaptation of a novel about the rivalry between two magicians turned into a life long obsessive fight, and although we do find interesting issues like the relationship between perception and reality and the border between life and illusion for an artist, the overall script is too much conventional in structure. The most disappointing is the ending, sure, we get an explanation for much of what we have seen, and the explanation makes sense, but then the magic is gone. You do not explain magic and expect for magic to stay.On the good side we have a strong hate story, which stays in the memory on the memorable stories of rivalry brought to screen, in the line of the 'Count of Monte Christo'. The script is well written, with some memorable lines. We also have Michael Caine whose every new act seems now to radiate personal charisma and the joy to be with us and act for us. Please Mr. Caine, stay with us and act for us forever.On the less good side I will put the acting in the two principal roles. Contrary to the majority of the opinions I do not believe that either Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale did a memorable job here. I mean they were OK, but the roles offered much better opportunities. Scarlett Johansson is undercast here, she deserves much more interesting roles. Cinematography and sets seem to be a little bit uninspired. Yet, the greater disappointment is that there is too little magic left when the film ends.",7,3,7,8 June 2007
Cloverfield," Godzila Meets the Blair Witch Project
","It could have been a very banal horror movie. Or it could have been a special effects blockbuster. Yet director Matt Reeves chose to do something different here. He put a video camera in the hands of one of his rather uninteresting yuppie characters and pretended that the whole film is a documentary starting with a good-bye party in Manhattan and continuing with a monster attack that plunges into pure horror, sometimes looking painfully similar to the amateur shots of the terror attacks on 9/11.This improbable combination works better than expected. The amateur camera pretext beautifully compensates for the low budget of the special effects. With the course of action cut every few seconds by the pretended lack of skills of the camera handler or better said handlers the linearity and simplicity of the characters are hidden and the holes of the plot not so evident. We never see too much of the monster because as soon as we see him the human holding the video camera needs to run for his life, but this adds to the unknown of the story. And by the end it looks like the camera may be the only survivor of the bloody series of events.This film could have been yet another teen horror or monster flick. It tries, dares, and succeeds to be something different.",7,0,0,3 June 2009
Hotel Rwanda," when humankind sleeps ...
","'Hotel Rwanda' is a docu-drama about one of the most shameful events in modern history. It is about the genocide in Rwanda, that happened only one decade ago, and the hard questions that need to be asked about how this was possible, and why governments and international organizations did not succeed in preventing it should haunt the minds of the politicians and of any decent person on earth.Still, this film is more about the human aspects of the conflict. As in 'Schindler's List', the action focuses on one episode figuring one noble figure of a real human, who succeeds to make a difference by saving innocent lives. Beautifully acted by Don Cheadle, the main character endangers his own life, and the security of his family, just because as a human he cannot behave differently. If we can be appalled by the dimensions of the Rwandian tragedy and the lack of humanity of the perpetrators of the crimes, the message of the film is basically optimistic, showing that human dignity not only survives in our cruel world of today, but also can succeed, can make a difference. If only all humans would behave like this ...I do not believe that this film is great cinema, but it is important, and it must have been made. It features some good acting from actors like Nick Nolte and Joachim Phoenix, but its value lays in having told the story, in a direct and fluent manner. Because of it, less people can pretend that they did not know that this horrible events happened now, in our contemporary times.",8,1,2,23 December 2005
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The Film That Comes from the Cold
","A few weeks after coming to Israel as a new immigrant in 1984 I started to borrow books from the public library in Lod. The first book that I ever read after becoming a free man was John Le Carre's 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'. Obviously the sophisticated world of Cold War espionage viewed from the perspective of the West was not the kind of theme that would allow books to be published in Communist Romania. I fell under spell from the first pages, and this was the beginning of a log term relationship of adulation and frequent reader mileage between me and Le Carre.I missed the very well made (as I hear) BBC series, so the film directed by Tomas Alfredson is the first screen version of the novel that I see. The principal lines of action and the relations between the characters are well kept here, and for most of the duration of the film the deep feeling of incertitude, the Britishness of feelings well concealed under manners, the foggy fights were the concepts of good and bad need to be found deep inside the hearts and minds of the characters receive appropriate translation in the language of cinema. The interior flow of Le Carre prose gets an equivalent in a series of short scenes, some happening in the present, other being flashbacks that get a pace and fluidity of themselves that make of the film a captivating thriller despite the lack of real action scenes. The Byzantine relations between the members of the secret services are translated into dances of characters that move and look to each other, or avoid one another like in sacred rituals. The Cold War atmosphere is put on screen using 70s-like effects, all blurred in smoke of cigarette, fog and frost.Some nuances get lost, and this is probably inevitable. Some characters get new dimensions or different perspectives. The sentimental aspect of the story (the relation between Smiley and his wife) is told, but loses in the context of the film the emotional importance it has in the book. On the other hand Gary Oldman builds a Smiley perfectly fit for the screen translation of Le Carre's intention. 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is one of the best adaptations of a novel by Le Carre that I have seen to date.",8,0,1,11 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," a cynical exercise in evil
","The movies fans word is divided in two - those who love Quentin Tarantino's work and those who hate it. There is almost nothing left out, if you have seen a film by Tarantino you either liked it immensely, or you felt insulted, disgusted and exposed to the worst of the bad taste. You probably dreamed about it the night or many nights after. You did not forget it completely. And it hardly left you indifferent. 'The Hateful Eight' will just deepen the abyss between the camps. Tarantino made not only another film but one that will confirm everything bad that haters dislike and will make delirious of evil joy the fans who admit they are fans and those who still feel it's good to be cautious nowadays in admitting they are fans.'The Hateful Eight' is full of quotes. The story is a crossing of action Westerns and Agatha Christie's mysteries - meaning that not only that there are a lot (and I mean a lot!) of gunshots, horses, two bounty hunters, one criminal on her way to be hanged and one sheriff (or maybe none) on one side, and characters that play roles and are being discovered by the smart detective via traps and dialogs (a lot of dialogs and I mean a lot!). The music is by Ennio Morricone who composed the unforgettable tunes of the spaghetti westerns half a century ago. There are references to Spielberg's Lincoln and to Tarantino's previous movies and especially Django Unchained which dealt with the same period and the racial relations from a very different perspective. However, if you have seen the film you will get to the conclusion that the quotes are intentionally non-respectful. The 'mystery dialogs' are long and verbose, and will make the action film fans checking if they did not enter the wrong cinema hall. The Lincoln starts and an apparent moral anchor to twist into an interpretation that I will not reveal but which looked to me like Tarantino telling Spielberg - this is what I do to the kind of themes you beat me with at the Academy Awards in 2012. Tarantino takes no prisoners. He is taking classical material, blending it, smashing it to the walls, shooting at it and spitting it back mixed with blood and poison. Sometimes literally.Then, it's a movie by Tarantino. If you are a fan you will get plenty of the gore stuff you like, you will get villains who can look charming for a few minutes an commit atrocities or be victims of atrocities the next ones. It's a well told story which proves again that Tarantino is in the big league of American film directors (together with the Coen brothers, Scorsese, Spielberg and Woodie Allen) who can invent and tell a story like no one does out of America. Acting is superb to the point that we hardly recognize Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell or Jennifer Jason Leigh. The vision is kitschy, is dark, is violent, there is no place for kindness, no morals, no values. It's Tarantino.",9,1,4,14 February 2016
Molly's Game," verbose and boring true crime biography
","Americans love the true crime genre. The big bookstores in the US have dedicated true crime books sections. Many of the Hollywood or independent films are based on true crime stories, biographies and memoirs of people who walked on the wrong side of the law. Good and bad books, good and bad films. 'Molly's Game' (written for the screen and directed by Aaron Sorkin and based on the auto-biographical book written by Molly Bloom) is a good example of how short is the distance between the good ones and the bad ones.Molly Bloom is a real person, born in 1978. She spent much of her childhood and teen years in sports training, she was a skier and Olympic aspirant, but jer sports career was cut short by an accident. Shortly after that event she became involved in the high-stakes poker games, at the edge of the law. While the money that the games she organized went up, her life spiraled down, she became involved in a big scandal and lawsuit involving the mafia, accused of money laundering and organizing illegal gambling. The whole operation fell apart during a big FBI crush-down on illegal games and gambling. The film describes her ascending and downfall, the inquiry and the trial during which she refused to become a state witness, preferring to plead guilty and eventually avoiding a prison sentence.Much of the film relies on acting performance of Jessica Chastain. She does a find job in describing a woman of character and ambition, who makes the wrong choices at several moments of her life, but finds the inner strength to assume responsibility and change the path of her own destiny. Unfortunately, Chastain's acting is not enough to save the film. Much of the screen time (which exceeds two hours) is spent in legalities and technical details about poker. You can follow these for a couple of times by a couple of minutes, but here they come back for almost all the duration of the movie. The second aspect that I did not like was the way the film describes the building of the relationship between Molly and her lawyer. There are several dialogs written by script author Aaron Sorkin that filmed director Aaron Sorkin liked so much that he forced the actors to declaim them at high pace, almost with no break for breathing. They looked to me theatrical and not credible. Another weak part in the script was the psychoanalytic explanation of Molly's choices which we get in a teary scene by the end of the film that contains a discussion between the hero and her father, who happens to be a clinical psychologist. The fact that the role is played by Kevin Costner did not help either, this is for Costner another bad choice among many that he made in his career.'Molly's Game' is probably close to the book and may be faithful to the real events which happened quite recently. They may have actual resonance which may be enough for a TV documentary drama but it is not enough to make of it a good feature film. Hints to real persons, actors or other celebrities are not relevant, especially for for international audiences. In the absence of true drama or characters evolution, we are served with a lot of legal and poker technicalities, and with a conventional and melodramatic view of the whole story. The result is verbose and boring, and seems even longer than its 140 minutes of screen time.",5,29,51,14 February 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," an amazing technical experience
","Having made some of the best and some of the most successful movies in the history of film making, Steven Spielberg has nothing to prove to anyone but himself. He is the complete master of the subjects and themes, genres and styles, and I suspect even of the financing of his films. Thus I am not surprised at all to see him pick Tintin as a hero for this film made in 2011 in which he plays on the ground of movies for children while allowing his own childish self to enjoy the making and the story and experimenting with the almost unlimited possibilities offered by computerized animation.There are two things that I did not like in Spielberg's version of Tintin. One is the de-belgization of the character. Titin as a character has a Belgian flavor and although his appearance and the the one of the surrounding characters created by Herge are respectfully preserved, the rest is all but lost in translation. The second is the fact that there is too much action in this film. Yes, Spielberg is a fantastic action director, but he seems to have become at some point too much absorbed in creating action at the expense of creating emotion. Kids today already have at hand a lot of action movies, TV shows, games. If this is to be a film for kids and if parents take their precious ones to see a film by Spielberg I would expect then to experience emotion and not so much action thrills.Otherwise The Adventures of Tintin is an amazing technical achievement and a superb visual experience. It's almost a masterpiece in hyper-realistic cartoon making if you believe such a combination exist. I must just honor the names of the people in charge with the art – they are Andrew L. Jones and Jeff Wisniewski. I will be excused however that I expected more from the great film-maker named Steven Spielberg.",7,1,3,9 February 2014
Ocean's Twelve," Stars in Dust
","How can the director of 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape', 'Erin Brockovich' and 'Traffic' do such a bad film? I was no fan of 'Ocean's Eleven' either, but 'Twelve' is by far worse. The film belongs to the genre of big burglary movies, but there is no credible or interesting story to follow or tell about. It's just a pretext to gather the most impressive list of stars in a major movie in the last year, and put a failure in the biography of each of them. The problem is that the story line is so broken and so confuse, that I simply did not understand the end, and worse than it - I did not even care. The brightest idea of the script is a cameo in cameo trick - you will find out when time has come, but it's too little for a genre that asks for creativity and humor. Some of the stars on the screen do their best, each is certainly flattered to share the screen with the other, but this is one of these movies where the stars simply cannot save the day. What a gathering of talent, and what a less than mediocre result. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale.",5,0,0,15 April 2005
Crash," A Los Angeles 'Wire' - good, but slightly over-rated
","'Crash' annoyed me to start from because it took the title of another film to remember by David Cronnenberg. It succeeds to be a different and interesting film however, so from now on we will need to say this 'Crash' or that 'Crash'.The film is built as a puzzle of loosely coupled stories, around the theme of the attitude of common people in their approach to people belonging to other communities, in the multi-racial Los Angeles of today. The mix technique is interesting, although if you carefully analyze it we have already seen it used in other films, one good example being the excellent HBO series 'The Wire'. Each of the individual stories has a moral theme, based on how initial judgment and race-based stereotyping can prove to be wrong - in the eyes of the characters, but also of the viewers.It's an interesting movie, although neither the script is that original, nor the racial theme approach is that crisply approached. It god very good critical feedback, maybe slightly better than it really deserves. At some points I had the feeling of manipulation, especially when world music was brought to help and channel feelings in the more pathetic scenes. Still, the overall sensation is of a well constructed puzzle, like life itself, or if you want like the diversified society it describes.One final remark, the whole cast is very good, but Matt Dillon is the best in the role of a racist cop, who proves to be much more complex and very different from what the spectator may originally think.",8,0,4,5 September 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," a dark fairy tale
","'Pan's Labyrinth' uses the format and borrows characters from the fairy tales genre, but takes it into extreme allegory territory. It is set in the Spain of year 1944, a year where Spain was just starting more than three decades of fascist rule. The principal hero is an 11 years orphaned girl, who is witnessing the tragedy in her family, the tyranny of a cruel stepfather, and the political turmoil around caused by oppression crushing the last remaining fighters of the Republican army. As many fairy tales heroes of her age she searches refuge in dream and imagination. The difference is that here the alternate reality may be as complex to cope with for the young girl and reality is.The whole idea of the film plays on the equilibrium and interference between the two worlds. While the fantastic world is built with the imagination of a Gothic thriller author, the real world seems to be impregnated as well with an aura of mystery despite the cruel and sordid deeds happening within. Although there is a clear delimitation between good and evil in the real world, decisions in the fantastic realm seem to be more complex, and the director refuses to make it a complete balance of reality. At the end what is different is actually the artistic treatment that the two alternate worlds receive in the movie. While the fantastic scenes are full of imagination and create a complex and interesting visual composition, the real world seems schematic and too much close to the conventional and politically engaged view of the period. This lack of balance is the one that makes so that this very interesting film does not reach in my opinion the level of a real masterpiece.",8,2,5,13 September 2007
Black Mass," an American anti-hero
","The season for screening films with ambitions for Academy Awards must have started. Black Mass is directed by Scott Cooper - a relative newcomer (this is only his third film) but a rising star among directors at Hollywood if we are to judge the impressing cast he succeeds to enroll - better and better and certainly more expensive from movie to movie. It seems to meet at least a few conditions to enter the competition for Academy nominations. It stars Johnny Depp in a role we barely recognize him which may well get him into the Final 5. It tells a story that captured at some point in time the interest and imagination of big audiences, and it deals with a Big American character. The fact that this character is a despicable gangster, who was in control of one of the lead Mafia gangs ('the Irish one') in Boston in the 80s and early 90s and was responsible for numerous murders and organized crime felonies may eventually matter when the jury will debate. Or maybe not. Until then, let us take our places in the theaters or download from the Internet and watch the movies.James 'Whitey' Bulger now serving a couple of life sentences is the kind of anti-hero America is fascinated with. The story starts in 1975, when Bulger is enrolled as an informant by the FBI - a status which together with the family ties (his brother played by Benedict Cumberbatch was a state senator) ensured him two decades of immunity and the almost total dominance on the crime industries in the Boston area after eliminating (with the help of the police and justice system) the Italian rival gangs. The story on screen mentions nothing about the still not elucidated episode of the murder of the 'Lady of the Dunes' that took place a year before, but does include the death of Bulger's only child that actually took place in 1973. From this episode we may or maybe are supposed to understand the motivations of his violence and lack of respect for law or human life? Quite thin for an explanation in my opinion. Despite Depp's fantastic acting the man behind the crimes remains an enigma.The rest is a 'true crime' story (the film is inspired by a true crime book) with the relations between the boss and his acolytes, the treason and executions of the traitors, the have-heard-it-already rants about the Mafia honor code, with corrupt cops and victimized girlfriends, and with a twist towards Bulger's support for Irish nationalism and terror movements, which was part of the reasons that led to his eventual fall. It started quite confusing to my taste, it improved as the story grew and the relation between characters became more clear (and the number of characters decreased :-) ) but it did not reach any of the peaks of the genre like in Scorsese's films or in Mystic River. Depp's performance is hypnotic, I will try a metaphor and say that he brings death to his hero on screen. Cumberbatch on the other hand will not get another Academy nomination for his role here. I know nothing at this point about the other candidates, but in an average to weak year I would bet for a couple of awards.",7,0,2,4 October 2015
Closer," great acting, but such a boring story
","It's really intriguing for me to see such an amazing pool of actors gathering to do a film based on such a booooooooring story. As I understand, the script is based on one of these London or New York theater plays dealing with modern relationships. The traditional triangle is here a square and the four characters located in modern London are playing for the about 100 minutes a game of true and deceived love and treason. The problem is that all the atmosphere is so dry and detached from reality. What may be working on stage is not transformed at all into good cinema. I could not get rid of the feeling of filmed theater for the duration of the whole movie, and I have different expectations from a theater play than from a cinema piece of art. What a pity to see the splendid acts of Clive Owen and Natalie Portman spoiled on such thin premises. Jude Law and Julia Roberrts are also quite good, but this film is yet another proof that great acting alone does not make a great movie. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale.",6,1,2,19 March 2005
Battleship Potemkin," a classic of its time
","What new can be said about a film that was commented by some of the most famous critics and was taken as inspiration by some of the most remarkable directors in the history of cinema? Even if one sees it for the first time it has good chances to recognize scenes or themes that were taken over by many other movies that followed.The new version that was shown by the European cultural TV chain ARTE brings a few new elements beyond the reconditioning of the film. It has a new musical score which is very well fit to the rhythm and action building that Eisenstein mastered so well. It also features an odd color addition that aims to emphasize the red of the flag raised by the revolutionary on the crusader which was an idea that I liked less. Most important it includes a prologue written by Leon Trotsky which was part of the original version screened in the Soviet Union in 1925, but which was censored shortly after, as Trotsky fell into Stalin's disgrace and than flew Soviet Russia in exile.Many scenes of the film keep their beauty and magic until today. The port of Odessa filmed in the morning fog by Eduard Tisse would be an impressionist masterpiece if it was a painting. The scenes of the shooting on the stairs or of the naval encounter in the final are exquisitely built and edited. Yet also the weak parts of the film are being made clear by the renovation and new screening - characters are stereotypes, and they serve a propaganda cause. For a viewer who has lived in the Communist system the political context and the background of the invented or deformed history put in the service of the enrolled messaging cannot escape.Esthetically 'Potyomkin' is and will always be a masterpiece. The message it carries is clearly dated.",8,1,2,11 August 2009
Shutter Island," Scorsese's Hitchcock
","Islands are terrific settings for thrillers. We know it from our own cinematographic experience, and we know we are in claustrophobic territory from the very first scene of this film, with the Shutter Island somewhere out of Boston in the mid-50s appearing in the mist under the gray oppressing skies. In Polanski's previous film or in the first series of Millennium there was a bridge to connect the island with the continent, here there is no bridge and a storm will soon cut any connection with solid ground and any way for the characters to get back to the safety of their routine existence. If there is one.There are a lot of Hitchcock quotes in this film of Martin Scorsese, we almost may characterize it as a Hitchcock film directed by Scorsese. The setting of the film in the 50s reminds immediately the great films of the master of the suspense from that period, and the main character, a US marshal sent to investigate the impossible disappearance of a patient in a special asylum, where criminals are treated for insanity using modern psychoanalytic methods behaves for a while as one of these Hitchcock heroes whose sanity is placed under doubt, but we know that it is not them but the world around that became crazy, and tries to pull him into its lack of sanity. Is this the case here? Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead role, I am no fan of his, but I confess to have liked immensely his acting here. In a film where nothing is really what seems to be, where the reality and terms of reference change slowly to be completely swapped by the end, his solid but very nuanced acting is critical and sustains the film from start to end. DiCaprio is present in every scene in the film, because what we see is what he sees, and what he feels starts to infuse into us viewers as the film progresses. His perception of reality becomes ours, his flashbacks bring his past under our eyes, his visions and nightmares end by hunting us.There are many beautiful scenes in this film, ideas, shots, dialogs that are all memorable. Acting from actors like Ben Kingsley or Max Von Sydow as two of the psychiatrists in the prison-asylum is positioning their characters against the evolution (or is it an involution) of the hero in search of the truth, which becomes a search of his own identity. If I am to explain why I was not completely happy with this film I would maybe blame its duration, the rule of 'way over two hours' which seems to have been legislated in Hollywood lately applies here as well, with no clear benefit. It's maybe a way to say - this is a serious and heavy movie- but there is no need to have said it in this case because the film is serious and catching and the final is hard to forget anyway. Less is better, here is another rule which could have applied. Scorsese makes great films, they need not be excessively long also.",8,2,5,12 July 2012
Lost in Translation," Sensible and complex, sometimes boring
","I believe that Sofia Coppola is a real talent - she has a different voice and vision and with time she will hopefully become  the mature and great director that her name deserves. 'Lost in Translation' is a complex story about two characters looking for a change in their lives, almost touching this change, but never really catching the opportunity. The scene is set in Tokyo, the characters are American, and they feel physically jet-lagged and culturally estranged. Although some of the lovers of the japan may find the kitschy rendition of this great culture non-balanced, the film makes the point that the blame lies with the American characters, never eager to explore the different culture, rather attracted to the same 'Western' sub-culture they know from home. I liked the ambiguity of the relationship - life is never clear cut as the Hollywood movies try to make it. I loved the characters, I salute the acting. I do not remember Bill Murray from other movies - I probably need to go back and do some research. And Scarlett Johansson - what? she is not even 20? She acts with sensitivity and maturity, she is beautiful and smart, and I wish her to become the big star she promises to be. Yes, the film is sometimes too long, and the repetition of some of the messages may look boring. But so is life sometimes. It reminds me some of the great films of Michelangelo Antonioni - same alienation, same beauty.

Doctor Strange," 3D confusion
","The genre of movies inspired by comics books seems to be one of the safest bets in Hollywood nowadays. It attracts stars and talents, and sometimes the results are brilliant. This is not the case with Doctor Strange, a film that tries to be different that the norm, but lacks in my opinion emotion and relies to a very large extent on special effects and the stars involved in the cast. Do they however get the roles they deserve? I love all work that I have seen until now by Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, but to a large extent I feel that their talent was wasted here.Script author and director Scott Derrickson specializes in films that combine reality and super-natural. This is the case with 'Doctor Strange' which is conceived as a fantasy combination between comics super-heroes and oriental philosophy or better said oriental mysticism. Unfortunately the whole 'philosophy' behind the film which is supposed to get the upper hand over the 'materialistic' and scientific is just cheap comics level phraseology. At first the combination hits the ridicule, later, with the repetition it becomes simply boring, so it did not work for me not even at the entertainment level. Also, for someone who did not read any of the original comics series some of the details and characters remain obscure - for example there are two level of 'bad guys' - one is more physical, the other more, let us say 'meta-physical' - I could not understand the relations between the two. There may be a full mythology developed in the comics series behind, but it stood hidden from me as just a film viewer.With the text being so thin, much is left to the visual part, which is certainly nothing less than impressing. The special effects of the alternate worlds are spectacular and will probably enter the contest for the Academy Awards in the technical categories (but have we not seen many of these already in 'Inception'?) I have seen the 3D version which could have benefited from more light, but this may have been the problem of the cinema theater I saw the movie in.The cast is impressing. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers the expected but his intensity seems wasted because of the pseudo-philosophical text, and his conversion from scientist to mystic arts master is not very credible. This is leaving to Tilda Swinton the best role in the film, another proof of her talent to build highly original composition characters. She is a strong contender in the supporting role competition at the Oscars. Yet, despite the visuals and the acting I could not avoid the feeling of confusion and lack of substance of the whole film. At the end of the film I felt like after one of these glamorous theater shows on Broadway where a lot of talent and effort (and money) are invested with little artistic or emotional return.",5,3,6,25 November 2016
Barry Lyndon," almost a masterpiece
","I saw this film for the first time, part of the Kubrick retrospective on the ARTE TV channel, and I was fascinated. This classical 18th century story written by a 19th century English writer is being brought to screen by Kubrick with an imagery and a style hard to equal. The story may be a moralistic one - a young Irish makes his way through cheats and lies to the higher positions in the British society, but is unable to live the live of his rank and survive at the pick, falling back mainly due to his own flaws of character. Kubrick films the story in a completely unemotional manner, no social or moral judgment is made, we are just brought a full world, or better say we enter a full world and we have to judge by ourselves.The quality of the visuals is one of the best in any movie I have ever seen. Kubrick seems to have spent a long time watching the paintings of the masters of the epoch, and his exterior landscapes as well as the interior scenes and the sitting and attitudes of his characters seem to be driven from some of these paintings, or even better said, create new ones. I also loved the way the music drives and paces the rhythm of the story, Kubrick used the same technique in 'Eyes Wide Shut' where music, image and actors seem to be part of a broader, more complex orchestration.The almost single weaker part of the story is Ryan O'Neal's acting, this immensely popular actor in the 70s is not up to this film, he seems too young all along, and almost nothing he does throws any light on the motivations of his character. Yet, these may have been Kubrick's directing indications, and he does not spoil the film either, it would have been hard to do it.",9,2,4,22 March 2008

","'Full Metal Jacket' is structured like a play in two acts, with little connection between the two parts excepting one of the principal characters. The first part describes the brutal basic training that turns young normal kids, just out of their childhood into killing machines. It's sarcastic, tragical funny, with excellent dialogs, pace and logic. The second part looks more like a war movie, which is kind of a paradox because it's a war movie within an anti-war movie. Arrived in Vietman the young people in the America 60s find themselves immersed within the same world of cruelty and immorality as any of their fellows sent to fight the just or the unjust wars of the past and of the present.Kubricks building has an internal balance despite the lack of symmetry of the two parts. The first scene is a typical disconnection between the normal life and the army. The last scenes show our heroes trying to exercise the feelings of human solidarity the real life, but facing the absurd and lack of any logic of the war. The common thread is the strong anti-war message, typical to Kubrick not only in this film.",9,1,6,2 November 2007
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," life and anger in deep America
","'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is positioning itself as the main favourite of the Academy Awards season, and if it will win some of the statuettes in the major categories it will be by merit. It is quite interesting that an Irish - British director succeeded to make such a sharp film about the territory that we know so little especially out of the US - the deep America, the one far of the glamour of the big cities or the sparks of high-tech. We should not be amazed however, as Martin McDonagh is a very special kind of artist, a playwright of great talent who has gradually broadened the scope of his plays from the Irish history and political present to British realities, and later to more broader human topics. As a film director he started with a short film set in Ireland that won an Academy Award in 2006, while his next two feature films are set in Europe (In Bruges) and Hollywood (Seven Psychopaths). The story in 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' takes place in the heart of America, I would almost say to the bleeding heart of the country, as the small city in Missouri can be seen as a micro-model of the complex realities of the US, with its prejudice and violence, but also with the humanity and power to heal of its people. The quality of the film making places it somewhere in-between or in the same league as the films of the Coen brothers and of Tarantino.Mildred ( Frances McDormand ) is a hard working woman, divorced and living from a gift shop in a place not many tourists come to visit. When her teen-aged daughter is attacked, raped and killed she feels guilt at the thoughts that she could have prevented her death and anger at what seems to be foot-dragging from the local police force led by sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). She turns her anger into action by posting bug announces on advertising billboards on a side road, but in short time her actions will put her in conflict with the rest of the community.There are many levels that the development of this story can be understood. People like Mildred (and not only her) are angry, and anger needs to be channeled into action. Does this action need to be violent? Does violence ever pay? Maybe this is one of the roots of the higher level of conflict and polarisation that we detect when we observe the American society in general and small communities like the one described in the movie in particular. Then, in true life, nobody is a perfect saint and nobody is pure evil either. The sheriff is terminally sick which makes the whole community to side with him in his conflict with Mildred, and maybe his inaction is only apparent, maybe there are crimes which cannot be really solved but by chance. Life is not as presented in the 'CSI' TV series (although a CSI element does appear in the story!). Mildred's actions seem all justified but do they have the effect that she desires, do they bring peace of mind, and especially do they bring closer the solution of the crime that took her daughter away? Can redemption be achieved by taking the law in your own hands or by punishing the committer of another crime?The script succeeds to bring to surface the characters and the environment they live in. Acting is superb. Frances McDormand makes us forget all those discussions about the lack of strong feminine lead roles in Hollywood and she may be on her way to a deserved second Academy Award. He words, her looks, her silences are just to the mark. I liked her performance here more that Meryl Streep's one in 'The Post'. Woody Harrelson provides another strong performance, but the real great surprise is Sam Rockwell whose nuanced interpretation of the role of Dixon (the sheriff's aid) was complex and subtle and succeeded to overcome one of the few weak points of the script, the change of perspective of his character.'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' is the best thing that I have seen until now in this pre-Academy Awards season. It makes the viewers immerse in the reality of the place it describes, it makes them think about the humanity that exists in each of us, about the need to act and the need to find peace of soul, about justice and vengeance and the difference between the two concepts. As with many good films its story and characters continue to be with us long time after the screening ends.",9,2,5,22 January 2018
American Sniper," no questions asked
","It is very difficult to judge this film without referring to politics. One can just read the viewers opinions in IMDb.One of the first scenes in 'American Sniper' defines the world of the hero. It's a childhood scene. The hero as a kid sits at the family table with his father, mother, brother. The father tells his view of the world. It is divided in sheep, heard-keepers and predators. Predators try to kill, sheep risk to be slaughtered. Nobody in this family will be a sheep. The 'yes, Sir' typical to the traditional American way of kids addressing fathers follows. This is the same 'yes, Sir' used in the Army.Clint Eastwood makes films with a talent that is in competition only with his skills as an actor. My problem with many of his films is that his heroes are so far of my world that I cannot avoid detesting them, as much as I admire Clint's artistic skills. True again for this film about the most decorated sniper in the history of the US Army.Now, the issue is that the hero described in Clint Eastwood's most recent film is a real character. The authors of the script did not even change his name (it's Chris Kyle) and many of the facts and situations described are taken from a book inspired by reality. We are shown a young man who decides to switch from rodeos to becoming a soldier after seeing the news on TV about the American embassies being blown up at the end of the 90s. 9/11 follows (again as a piece of TV news) and this is enough to convince him that his tours of duty in Iraq serve the noblest possible cause. If he ever asks questions about the policies of his government, if he ever has any doubts about his life being torn to shreds by the conflict between his duties as a soldier and the duties to his family - these are never shown on screen.There are two other memorable scenes I took from the film. In one of them an Arab kid takes a rocket launcher and almost fires it. The hero prays that the kid drops the weapon so that he would not be obliged to kill him. His prayers are heard. Later in the film an Army shrink asks him whether he has any regrets about what he did during his service (he is credited with 160 enemies killed in action as a sniper). 'No, Sir' he answers, the day he will face the Creator he will have clean conscience about each of them. I could not avoid asking myself the question - what if that kid would not have thrown the weapon and would have been the 161st? Can soldiers involved in the bloodiest of the wars ever come home? Mentally, with their souls intact? Such questions are asked by many films and are asked implicitly by 'American Sniper' as well. Apparently the film takes no position while it describes a real life character who can be read both as a hero and as a casualty of war. I can but admire the splendid acting of Bradley Cooper who simply brought back Chris Kyle to life of screen. Eastwood's story telling skills are exquisite, and while I am no big fan of war scenes I liked the way he staged these. I liked less the one-sided view of the conflict and the situations in Iraq, but let us recognize that this is a film about an American soldier and his perspective of the war. The fact that this is the kind of hero glorified by the society tells more than anything about the world we live in.",5,3,30,14 March 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," a boring film about a supposed world of glamor
","Some people think that this world of glamor exists. It is located in a remote galaxy named the United States, on a solar system named New York, and more precisely in the center of planet called Manhattan. The inhabitants of this world seem to be obsessed with their clothing and they do not behave very nicely to citizens of other galaxies.Maybe the life of those aliens is interesting for some folks, but it is not for me. The action of 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a little bit more than a sitcom, but not much more. 'Sex in the City' without the sex if you see what I mean. Actually David Frankel directed a few episodes of 'Sex in the City' and his skill in filming New York and love for the city is visible.It is not that horrible as a film though. Meryl Streep is always fascinating to watch, although half of the screen time is spent in showing her in various closing for no longer than two seconds. In the other half she succeeds to create a female executive character that is strong and credible, one percent human and 99 percent not, you feel like you may have met her in the board room of any American corporation. The Oscar nomination seems a slight exaggeration though. I was not too impressed by Anne Hathaway, who is playing the principal role of the young journalist trying to make a career as PA of the famous Streep, opposing integrity and humanity to the she-devil. It is maybe because it's hard to be a female actress in the shade of Streep, or just because big eyes do not automatically make you an Audrey Hepburn. The role I actually liked more was the one of Stanley Tucci as the slightly effeminate and affecting editor, charming and self-ironic in the right doses.All these save the film from being the complete disaster the conventional story deemed it to be, but cannot raise it above the threshold of mediocrity. At least thanks to it and to wikipedia I now know what Prada is :-)",5,0,0,2 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The Force is Alive
","This is one more episode in the Star Wars series, and there is not much more to say. The epics continue, for whoever is interested. But as we all know the story line is not really important here. Fans (and I am one of them) come to see the films in this series mainly for the fairy sci-fi tale atmosphere, for the infinite cast of space creatures, for the laser weapons fights and for the space or flying speed races. Acting is mediocre, dialogues succeed to provide the usual quantity of 'Star Wars' quotes without being at all natural, and even some of the effects are not that impressive - but what is impressive, now that we have seen 'Lord of the Rings'. However, the Force is still alive in this film, and this episode has stylistic consistency with the rest. Go with the right mind set, and you will enjoy it. 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,0,2,1 February 2003
American Hustle," smartest film of the year?
","I really needed this film two days after watching and being so disappointed with Gravity. I am pretty sure that American Hustle will make ways less money than 'Gravity' and will get less Academy Awards if any. It is however a much better film in my opinion, smart and sensitive, funny and entertaining, and in its way represents much better today's (or yesterday's) America.The story happens in the late 70s – early 80s in Manhattan and part in New Jersey, these two settings which may provide the background for more than half of the movies about America today, and is based in part on the real story of an FBI investigation that discovered wide-spread corruption in the local and national politics. In order to infiltrate in the local environment the Bureau investigator (Bradely Cooper) devices a scheme in which he blackmails a couple composed of a con man (Christian Bale) and his partner and lover (Amy Adams) are sent to lure a local politician and then other by offering them bribes. Same as in director David O. Russell previous film Silver Linings Playbook, (also set between NJ and NYC) none of the characters is really normal, they all have their non-negligible dose foolishness, malice and stupidity.There are two reasons for which American Hustle works well. The first is that the structure of the script is well designed, and the characters are very credible with all their goods and flaws. The second is that Russell's style of directing his actors enhanced the feeling of authenticity. Russell picked a team of very talented actors whom he knew well from previous films and let them create and improvise each their own roles. The result is bright. Christian Bale is hard to recognize physically, he is a smart and pathetic, loving and cynical con man. The actor of so many feel-good movies Bradley Cooper is mean and dark. For the first time I have seen here Jennifer Lawrence in a role (Bale's wife) that justifies the praises he received from many critics. Last and best – Amy Adams is unbelievably beautiful and vulnerable – she looks like a 2013 version of the best of what Jane Fonda could be. The cake has a glazing, and it's called Robert De Niro (uncredited for some reasons) – he does the older and tired version of the role he played so many times, and I hope that his devastated looks were just make-up.Smartest, maybe best American film that I have seen in a while.",9,4,13,27 December 2013
Top Secret!," Awful
","Well, I got enough of guessing if the humor in this movie is voluntary, or involuntary. Some may call it a parody, but the only parody is the claim of the authors that they know anything about film making. They certainly have no clue about geography, history, the difference between Communism and Fascism (East Germany was more anti-fascist than its Western counterpart, guys!) and less of all about cinema. The only humor may be related to some US TV comedy jokes, but this is mostly lost 18 years after the making of the movie, or was lost from the beginning for the non-US audiences.
Skip this precursor of the parody about films genre when you meet it at the movie rentals. 4/10 on my personal scale.",4,4,19,29 November 2002
The Bourne Ultimatum," best action thriller in a while
","If this film is the best action thriller in a while and yet it gets only a 7/10 grade says something about the films which premiered this year, one of the less interesting I remember in the history of cinema, and especially of the big American studios. That this film is the third in a trilogy is not surprising, because most if we shall remember anything at all it may be some sequel or third film in a trilogy like this one. I may be wrong, it's only August, but I am afraid that I am not mistaken.To its credit The Bourne Ultimatum has everything an action thriller needs, has a credible pretext, a likable hero, pace, logic, and keeps the viewer interested all the way. Director Paul Greengrass who made us dizzy in the previous installment with the fast under-second takes is combining now short and long takes and the result is in very well filmed set of action scenes that despite the lack of spectacular and expensive effects bring some sense into the action and uses in a wonderful manner the urban settings familiar to many. Logic holes and hard to believe details are not missing completely, but at least the action is simple enough to be followed, complex enough to be interesting, and also has the righteous spin of the Hollywood movies to please the more conventional viewers. Matt Damon is sensitive and efficient and makes us care about him to the point where we would hope he meets some more consistent feminine counter-part. Don't lose hope for him however, as the quasi-open ending leaves some hopes that if BU will be doing well in the box-office this may not be the last film in the series.",7,3,6,17 August 2007
Nightcrawler," news scavengers
","It's really amazing that 'Nightcrawler' is the first directing achievement of Dan Gilroy - whose record only includes a few scripts (one of the Bourne series movies among them). It's a real catchy, witty, brutal and realistic story about the thirst for sensations in the news and the monster it creates. It's also a very well written story (Gilroy authored it as well) with crisp and interesting characters which we keep discovering as long as they are alive on screen. The visuals also have quality - on one hand I have visited Los Angeles recently, so I could not only recognize the places but also feel the atmosphere, on the other hand much of the action happens at night and is news related, so the nervous camera moves with focus on blood and violence makes a lot of sense.The main character, Louis Bloom is unemployed. I suspect that the proximity with another more famous character L. Bloom is not coincidental, as like Joyce's Ulysses he is wondering at nights in a big city, looking however to more earthly matters of life. He is a smart unemployed who spends his time navigating the Internet in search of educational and motivational stuff that can push him out of the current status of small criminal, steeling metals and selling them by the pound. The only problem is that nobody wants to hire him, despite his verbal skills of self-promotion, and the reason is bluntly put to him by a potential employer: 'I am not hiring thieves'. There is however one industry that does not seem to have such scruples: it's the crime news industry. Local TV networks are ready to pay good in order to serve their customers (us!) the bloodiest news and the most graphical images at breakfast time. Bloom will soon learn the technicalities of the profession, and find inside himself enough resources not only to survive but also to become successful in it.The action takes place in Los Angeles, and we can even see the Hollywood sign at some point, but it's far from the typical Hollywood production. It actually has more of an indie atmosphere, and reminded me at some moments 'Drive' which was released three years ago. Same intensity, same fringe world. The difference is in the approach. There are no good guys in 'Nightcrawler', maybe the exception of Lou's assistant Rick (played by Riz Ahmed) who does not have much chance of survival in the world described by the film. The film takes also a sharp critical stand about the business, work and human (or should I say inhuman?) relation in the corporate world of America. The words we can hear day to day in the corporate environment sound so natural in the mouths of the criminals. Something must be wrong with the words or the way they are used.On a higher level however the film is not only about the industry and one specific character that makes his way in it. It is also about the audiences who create the demand for sensationalistic news soaked in blood. About us.Much of the quality of the film relies on Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Bloom. Gyllenhaal has in this movie the sparkle, darkness and craziness of the big roles. He may not get the Academy Award this year, but he is getting close to that level. Rene Russo also provides an excellent support as the hungry producer ready to accept almost anything and to bend almost any moral or legal rules in order to rise the rating of her news show.This was the first movie I have seen in 2015. I can only wish that the year in movies will be as good as this one.",8,1,1,3 January 2015
The Aviator," hype was exaggerated, not wining the Oscar justified
","This was supposed to be one of the greatest film of the year, and a plethora of Oscar nominations gave hope that Scorsese will make it this time. He did not, and he did not deserve it.Not that this is a bad movie. Scorsese knows to tell a story, and as a docu-drama 'Aviator' is one of the best. The problem is that the film tries to be a lot more including to meet the challenge of 'Citizen Kane' - much inspired of the same character. It fails exactly where a film like 'Beatiful Mind' succeeded - in explaining the mix of genius and paranoia, of vision and eccentricity, of the business leader and frivolous entertainer of movie stars. The scene in the character childhood trying to explain the obsession of a whole life is simplistic and lacks not logic, but artistic truth.Worst is the mis-casting of Leonardo di Caprio. I confess that I am no fan of his, and I believe that after sinking 'Titanic' he now crashes 'Aviator'. He cannot track the aging of the character, and he is far of the complexity of Crowe in 'Beautfiul Mind'. As a compensation we have Cate Blanchett, shining as ever in Hepburn's role.Not that it's a bad film. It tells a lot about the period, about aviation and cinema, about the conflict between the South and the North in the American mentality. But is is far from any psychological depth, and does not raise to the level of expectations and of the hype.",8,3,5,12 June 2005
Oblivion," when games work
","I liked many things in 'Oblivion', actually more than I expected. I am no fan of computer games, certainly not of these that are dominated by machine guns and laser guns, by cars races and space-ships races - and there are plenty of those in the film directed by Joseph Kosinski. I disliked many of the films that bring to screen heroes and action inspired by comics or graphical novels, and 'Oblivion' is based on one written by the director. And I am not too sympathetic to the action heroes roles that Tom Cruise picks almost exclusively lately, the main reason being that by doing this he buries in the past an excellent actor (hopefully just puts him to freeze). Despite all these wrong starting points, I liked a lot (but not all) in this movie.The story conceived by director, script writer and games creator Joseph Kosinski happens in an uncertain future. The world as we know it ended in 2017. Earth came under attack, Moon was destroyed and the nuclear weapons of Armageddon were used in self defense. Mankind won the war but lost the planet Earth now inhabitable, and will soon be moving to a new home, one of the satellites of Jupiter. It's only that almost nothing of what we see in the first 15 to 30 minutes of the film is what viewers are actually made to believe. 'Oblivion' starts like a very standard comics-inspired film, and as we got used to its world, something happens that is quite unusual in routine movies of its genre. Characters start to develop, they learn about themselves, they ask questions about their own identity. Eventually the movie will turn into the action thriller that it was advertised to be, but this will happen in a smart manner, and the heroes end by being something very different from our initial guesses.A few words about acting. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman are two names that do not need any introduction. Cruise gets more opportunities for an interesting role and deals with them honorably. Freeman has a much drier part and cannot make too much to enrich it. The real surprise is Olga Kurylenko, not only fit to the action role, not only looking good, but also acting appropriately in a key role.There are two interesting aspects in which 'Oblivion' breaks the rules of the genre and helps being more than just another adaptation of a graphical novel. One aspect is that the viewers discover together with the heroes that the world where the action is located is something very different from what they thought it is. This complete change in their systems of reference and values doubles with a story line that has clear ecological and political references to the present, although the action takes place in a not very immediate future. The dangers of the new technologies like AI and cloning when they fall into the wrong hands are clearly articulated. The second aspect is that the graphics fit well the idea of the two intersecting and interchanging worlds. In the beginning the film has a very computer graphics game look which describes at perfection the apparently ordered world. Later the border between the artificial and idyllic worlds and the complex realities of the future begin to blur, we see the 'monsters' and realize that they may not be what they seem to be. There is also a political saying about a world where drones play such a central place from fighting the wars of the humans to protecting and saving their lives. 'Oblivion' has many quantities that make if different from the crowd and is definitely worth a try.",7,0,1,6 September 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," piercing the sky
","I am a daring person and I confess what very few people seem to have the courage to confess nowadays. I never was a great fan of 'Queen' or Freddie Mercury. It may be my dislike for the disco genre and the suspicion that this rock band with incontestable talent and which has reached immense planetary success, slid too much towards this direction. It may be the fact that by the time when 'Queen' were rising and had reached the peak of their glory I was behind the Iron Curtain with all what that meant from a point of view of censorship. Anyway, it's a fact, but at least this gave me the advantage of seeing and judging 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without the prejudice or extra-enthusiasm that many of the fans seem to have in the opinions they expressed about the movie.Not being too updated about the biography of Mercury and the history of the group, most of the information brought to screen by the film was new to me. As I understand there are some inaccuracies but the spirit of the band was kept true by the two veteran members of 'Queen' who are still active and who read the script and surveyed the filming. They seem to have had such an influence on the film that director Bryan Singer did not complete his work, although he is still the only one credited, and the differences of opinion with them led to Sacha Baron Cohen giving up acting in the lead role. We are left with a story of the raise, the troubles and the tragic end of a star who aimed to pierce the skies with his music, but the same ambition as well and his incapacity to control his personal life daemons led to his burning out fast after reaching the peak. The film deals mainly with the period of his ascend and culminates with what is considered today to have been the best concert Freddie Mercury and 'Queen' ever gave and one of the best in the history of pop music - their section in the Live AID concert on Wembley, on July 13, 1985.What I liked: The rendition of the atmosphere and sound of the music clubs and recording studios of the 70s is very credible, close to a documentary, and I mean the positive interpretation of the term. The stories about how some of the most famous songs of the band came to life are very interesting, and I do not care too much if they are not 100% a accurate. The recreation of the band concert at the AID Life mega-show on Wembley is a masterpiece. All details are being brought to screen at perfection and the atmosphere is as electric as it was on the stadium. I have seen again the original footage on youTube, and the twenty-something minutes in the film seemed to be another version of the same event, filmed with different cameras. The soundtrack is also excellent.What I liked less: I feel that Rami Malek is a miscast. He is doing great efforts to replicate the moves, the grimaces, the moods of the real Freddy Mercury but he lacks the charisma and the stage presence of the artist. The teeth prosthesis is ridiculous. All this is mixed into the melodramatic construction of the script and the effect is at some moment closer to parody than to real emotion.Frankly, I believe that the producers missed a great opportunity by not succeeding to bring Sacha Baron Cohen in the cast. It would certainly have been a different film, as Cohen is known for insisting on his personal ideas in executing his roles. I am not sure that my opinion about 'Queen' and Freddy Mercury would have changed, maybe the film would have been less reverential to the factual history of the band, but certainly it could have been a more interesting movie.",7,2,4,3 December 2018
Burn After Reading," a funny film about stupid people
","There is one mis-perception that this film fixed in my mind - there are not really funny films about stupid people. Stupid people are ... well ... stupid, their behavior is by definition subject of easy jokes, so for smart and educated audiences laughing at stupid people comes together with a feeling of guilt. No fun.What makes 'Burn After Reading' different then? I think that one of the reasons is that this is not only a comedy about stupid people, but more about a stupid people in a stupid system. The Coens attack, catch, and dissect a lot of holy cows of the American political system (the CIA, the government secrecy), morality (matrimonial fidelity), social habits (Internet dating, the gym) and national obsessions (the shrink, the divorce lawyer, the plastic surgery).Almost nothing that is a cliché in the average American behavior escapes becoming a victim of their cynical look.While the script has certainly its role in the success of the comic experience, the story by itself does not try to be more than a funny chain of coincidences that hit a bunch of characters that act according to their immediate instincts and bad planning, something that brings us back to the time of the great comedies in the 30s and 40s of the past century. It would have been of no special effect without the master story telling skills of the Coen brothers, which pace their gags and laughs in the 96 minutes of screening (low figures well below recent Hollywood average).Overall however the film succeeds through the perfect casting, and the brilliant manner by which the Coens succeed to bring the best out of their actors. John Malkovitch is an actor of all seasons, one of those that brings his personality in any role he does. Not here, where he melds into the alcoholic spy clerk, who loses his useless job and wife, hates the whole world and nobody cares about him, his life, or even about him losing the secrets he was supposed to have learned during his career. Frances McDormand who was the Coen's unexpected heroine in 'Fargo' is back in the role of a gym clerk who does not hesitate to betray her country to finance plastic surgery, but worries even more being in time at her workplace after leaving the Russian embassy. Brad Pitt is her gym trainer companion, looking flat-minded and younger than in the teen years of his role as Benjamin Button.And then George Clooney. I feel every time that I write about Clooney in the last few years that I need to apologize (to myself of course, as he does not read me or care) for having underestimated his talent and having considered him yet another TV actor and beautiful face. His work as a director and his last performances as an actor are better and better. Here he is superb, the happy husband who cheats his wife with Internet dates without knowing the reason, the involuntary and hysterical killer who associates with other stupid people in senseless actions.Yes, it's a cynical view of the world - but hey, this is entertainment, these are the Coen brothers.",8,2,5,1 February 2010
Watchmen," beautiful expensive nonsense
","I am no fan of the super-heroes films genre, and 'Watchmen' did not change this. The film tries to build a sophisticated intrigue which gives to several superheroes a past and some dilemmas to deal with (beyond saving the world) in a revisionist version of history where the Vietnam war was won by a super-heroes helped America and Nixon won four consecutive presidential mandates. Actually this alternate history landscape and the beautiful cinematography are the best parts in the film, which otherwise I found to be a pretentious and long nonsense.Now my son points to me that איק graphic novel the film is based upon is one of the best and most known modern literature works of our age and is studied and read even in academical institutes. Maybe, but this still could not make me believe for one fraction of second the view of the latex-costumed heroes dealing with relationship traumas. The level of the cinematographic realization was also uneven. Splendid computerized effects (like when Dr. Manhattan finds himself on Mars) coexist with what looks like bad make-up of the main heroes. Was this intentional? Maybe, but I missed the intention.Oh, yes, one more grouping of sequences I loved - the scenes with the plethora of generals in the situation room surrounding the old venerable president Nixon ready to decide on starting WWIII based on a 54% estimation that the whole Soviet Union will be nuclearly annihilated, while 'only' a few big cities on the US East Coast will be hit in the retaliation. This looked like an homage to 'Dr. Strangelove' and was superb. But not enough.",4,2,5,4 July 2012
The Bourne Identity," Robert Ludlum Book as a Major Studios Subject
","Robert Ludlum is one of my favorite spy stories writer. Many of his books deal with the issues of memory, and describe common people accidentally caught in spy intrigues webs. 'The Bourne Identity' is the case of such a lost memory case - with the main hero suffering of amnesia and learning fast that his true identity may be one he prefers to keep forgotten.
Unfortunately, the complexity of the Ludlum action is badly brought to screen in this film. We never get a good explanation of what really was behind the complex and seemingly all powerful spy organization that tries to eliminate our hero. The action is paced, there are many good atmosphere scenes, a plausible romantic thread, but the logic is missing, and many viewers may be in the situation of not really being able to describe what the film was about, after having seen it. Still, good entertainment - 7/10 on my personal scale. Action and spy movie fans will not be disappointed after all.",7,0,1,6 June 2003
The Italian Job," Waste of Time
","What a disappointment! This film was so talked about as one of the good action movies of the summer that I bought a ticket and went with some expectations. What I was served with was a 70s like robbery movie, without the humor and the good story telling of the 70s. Mark Wahlberg seems to spoil every film he plays in, and Charleze Theron will put completely her career on a dead end if she continues to pick scripts like this. The rest of the characters are just cartoons. About the director I can just say that he accomplishes the almost impossible - spending producers money to make an expensive action film that looks just boring! 5/10 on my personal scale.",5,1,2,7 September 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Good Ending to the Matrix Trilogy
","The first 'Matrix' was one of the best science fiction films that I have ever seen. The second was a failure, and I was concerned about the third being even worse. Well, for once, my concerns were not justified, and the final (is it final really?) movie in the series without being as good as the first one is not a bad movie at all. On the bad side, there is nothing too original or too unexpected in this series. It very much continues the second part, and I remember having read that the authors consider the two last parts as one film. Some of the pseudo-philosophy could have been avoided, and the symbols are not that deep as the authors would like us to believe. Overall, this 'quality' part of the story and film is the weakest. Now the good side. The action is really good, and the effects are as good as you can get with the technical means of the beginning of the 21st century. It may come as surprise, but the real art in this film is in the good cinema created by the effects. Some good acting helps, casting is good excepting Monica Belucci - I cannot imagine why such an exquisite and beautiful actress accepted to play this purely decorative role - Maybe she just wanted to be part of the movie?The film got a lot of bad critics, and I do not really understand why. Maybe it is because of the high expectations the first 'Matrix' created. In any case, it is not bad at all, and the trilogy gets a good ending, although not an exceptional one. Yes, the Wachowsky brothers can do better, and the audiences are waiting for better from them. This one gets an 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,0,0,13 December 2003
The Village," welcome back M. Night Shyamalan
","I was disappointed of M. Night Shyamalan falling under Mel Gibson's religious fervor and mixing science fiction with Catholicism in 'Signs'. Luckily, my concerns were eased by 'The Village'. M. Night Shyamalan is back, and 'The Village' sits well among his good movies.A previous commenter observed that two categories of viewers seek M. Night Shyamalan's movies. Those who like horror stories, and those who look for the hidden traps specific to his writing and directing. In my opinion both categories find good stuff here. The horror story thread is very convincing, and the first half of the movie recreates a 1800s American settlers environment mixed with a Gothic horror story thread that was very credible for me. Yes, I was willing to be fooled, but you need to be a willing fool if you want to enjoy horror movies. The explanation of the trap in the second part of the film has logic and morals. One may argue about the approach taken by the characters in their attempt to fly the evils of civilization, but not with the quality of the cinema used to give the story.Cinematography fits well the twists of the action, with a color code that is well explained and will soon become part of the stony. Acting is superb. Jaochin Phoenix and Adrien Brody give two of their best performances ever, William Hurt is William Hurt, and the fresh face of Bryce Dallas Howard fills in well the screen in her first lead role.Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",9,0,1,26 February 2005
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg takes on the Cold War
","So after sharks, dynos, extra-terrestrials, WWII, Holocaust, Olympics terrorism, future, Lincoln and handful of other themes, it's the turn of the Cold War to be processed, re-created and brought to screen in the vision of Steven Spielberg. 'Bridge of Spies' inspired by the historical character of James B. Donovan, defender of the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and then main negotiator in the spies exchange that set him free for the US pilot Gary Powers downed while in a mission over the USSR, is also the first movie in the political thriller genre directed by Spielberg.Had the script of this film been written by Ken Follett or the late Robert Ludlum, I would probably have accepted much easier the outcome. However, when brothers Coen are two of the three authors of the script I would have expected more than a smooth narrative structure and well written dialogs (in many moments). There is almost nothing of the sparks or daring insolence of many of the scripts in the films directed by the two. The story is roughly divided into two parts, and the tentative to synchronize the two threads (Abel's story and Powers' story) fail not only because they were separated in time by five years but also because it is only the first that has interesting material and consistency. The lawyer who does the right thing defending the rights of a criminal who presumably caused harm to his own country in time of what some perceived as war is too gross an analogy to the contemporary fight against terror viewed from a liberal point of view. The second part is more like the classical East Berlin spy stories, but here again the schematic description of East Berlin and of the Eastern German policemen and even officials lacks authenticity and complexity.We are left with enjoying two formidable performances by Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and especially by Mark Rylance and Rudolf Abel. I am looking forward to the nominations for the Academy Awards and I hope that Rylance will get at least an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. His act here is my favorite from all 2015 movies I have seen until now. On the other hand the political messages that this film tries to convey are much too obvious. Yes, they are important, but important messages are not well served when the style gets that close to propaganda. Actually the genre this film is closer than other is the Western. One lonely hero fights for justice against the whole world and wins against all odds. It's just that the century is the 20th and the hero is not using his gun, but is a lawyer. Problem is that the analogy does not work very well in this recent film of Spielberg.",6,1,3,23 December 2015
Pitch Black," Good B-class Movie
","The B-class science-fiction movie is surprisingly good. The plot is simple, and has logic - Survivors of a long distance space crash fight for survival on a three suns planet. They have to face unknown dangers, but also their own characters. Acting is good, violence is never cheap, and the effects prove that you can do a lot with little money. It is worth watching, and better than the sequel('Riddick', after the name of one of the main characters) which was released in 2004. The quality of the cinematography is especially good, from the filtered light of a always lit world to the darkness of an eclipse happening every 22 years. Another interesting and original concept is presenting a group of Muslims in the future - taken into account the stereotypes too often met in recent movies their presence is fresh and different here. Overall, good science-fiction and good action, worth a watch, certainly for the fans of the genre but not only.",7,0,0,8 March 2003
Cold Mountain," what one would expect from a good Hollywood movie
","'Cold Mountain' is a big studio epic, and a good one for a change. All elements of a successful creation of this kind are in place - a good historic theme, super-stars casting, good cinema (much was filmed in location in Romania) , and a message that is beyond the plot, and makes the film worth watching. The message is about the vanity of war, the conflict between love and man's brutality, the will of the human beings to love and survive despite the wish of their leaders to push them to war one against the other. It's an actual theme today as well, unfortunately.What the viewer gets is a good cinema treatment, a superb war scene at the beginning of the film setting the background and providing Law's character motivation for the rest of the movie, and very good acting from Renée Zellweger. I was slightly disappointed by Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. Each of them was good, but not at their best, and they never showed up the radiant chemistry of a true great love story as they should have. A full world of good supporting characters and solid cinematography re-create the world of the American civil war in a fresh way, despite the many other memorable film stories inspired by those times. It's what you expect. Nothing less, maybe a bit more. 8 our of 10 on my personal scale.",8,2,3,18 September 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," the right to be a loser
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is not at all my kind of movie, and yet I enjoyed watching it. The story is about a gathering of characters who call themselves a family, each bringing his or her own combination of dreams, stereotypes and disappointments, trying to make their ways in the context of the very American competitive system to which none seems to fit very well. When the little daughter in the family wins the right for a hopeless participation in a kids beauty pageant the family embarks in a trip that would make them maybe see where the right value of their lives lies.The nice thing in this movie is the freshness and sincerity of acting. First time directors Dayton and Faris succeed to make the characters alive, distinct and likable from the very first minutes and so they remain for the whole duration of the movie. There is a lot of talk in the film about how not to be a loser, and apparently the characters as individuals and the family as a whole seem to be super-losers in the real world, yet on the human plan they end by being winners, and so they are in the hearts of the viewers.",8,1,2,22 June 2007
Knowing," ine of the best science-fiction films lately
","I am part of a proud minority who likes Alex Proyas' films. While almost everybody hated 'I, Robot' not having found in it, the image of Asimov's work that they expected I liked the way Proyas dealt with this theme. It looks that this time also few critics enjoyed this film and its ambitions - I actually liked most of its vision and coherence.'Knowing' starts as some kind of Dan Brown mystery, with a time capsule letter put on earth 50 years ago by a young college student in Massachusetts being found by a nowadays astro-physicist to contain exact dates and number of victims of almost any catastrophic event that happened between 1959 until today. The today hero is played by Nicholas Cage, a widowed single father whose son plays a role in the story, as he seems to start hearing the same voices and has the same vision as the girl who wrote the prophecy 50 years ago. Philosophical discussions about determinism and fate develop in parallel with the anxiety of the characters, the atmosphere slides into Gothic including a Psycho-like mansion that starts to be haunted by strange visitors. The combination between horror and contemporary action films works very well, because it has logic and consistency. It is not only that the special effects are very well made, but they also are in the right place in the story, and the right dose, being not a goal but a means to pass a message.Sure, this message is ambitious, and for some people it may look disturbing or may seem to question or explain too much fundamental religious beliefs. The final part of the film turns into something again different, big catastrophe film combined with extra-terrestrial visitors a la X-file story. I would have been normally shocked by such an exotic mix, but I actually enjoyed it and made to believe it - in cinema logic terms of course. In many cases the problem with films extra-terrestrial is that they are better when you expect the outer-space visitors than when you see them. Without completely avoiding the slight disappointment one feels seeing on screen outer-space visitors and their space ships, in this case the effects are well made and the graphics beautiful. It is worth seeing the film in cinema theaters by the way, for the dimension of the effects. The camera work and the pallet of colors are also remarkable, and so is the music which combines classical scores by Beethoven for example with the original music of Marco Beltrami. It is only in the final scenes that the cinema solution lacks originality reminding too much 'Contact', but it does fit in the intentions of the authors, and overall the film provides a good cinematographic experience.",8,0,1,8 August 2009
Hugo," dreams of cinema
","For me the rebirth of cinema in 3D, the moment when the technology met with art is not 'Avatar' but Scorsese's 'Hugo'. James Cameron's film validated the technology, brought it into the mainstream, and – of course – made a lot of money in the process. Hugo is in my opinion the first great film realized in this technology, taking a rather melodramatic story targeting the all family audiences and using 3D to amplify the visual effects, to create a world of dreams and fantasy – the material great films are made from. Based on the Paris of the 1920th it recreates the city on screen in a manner that is spectacular and sensitive at the same time, and populates it with characters who meld the qualities of fiction heroes and flesh and blood humans. The complexity of the staging, the attention to the details, the pace of the action and of the moves of the camera, the world of objects who surround the heroes – all this get together in a charming visual experience. We have known many versions of Paris in art, some from books like (Victor) Hugo, some from photos like the ones of Brassai or Robert Doisneau, some from works of art like the paintings of the Impressionist era, now we have the Paris as imagined by Martin Scorsese.Bringing George Melies into the story is a real touch of genius.This film is a love declaration for cinema, full of respect and quotes from famous movies. The comparison with the other big film about cinema in 2011 The Artist is immediate and makes us forget immediately the simplistic kiddish story. But the story itself has a quality that makes jealous the current Disney productions. This is real Disney stuff, the one that would not make Master Walt blush as would the majority if not all the scripts of the films made by the studios who inherited his name. This is the Disney of Fantasia, the one that made me dream and cross the barriers of imagination.George Melies actually did break with the studios and retired from film making before the war, and many of his films were destroyed to be used to manufacture military materials. He had a shop in the Montparnasse train station, and even if a round-eyed boy who was making the clocks turn in the station did not really exist – the imagined part of the story is as good and as moving as the real one.A film like Hugo does not necessarily excel in acting, although big names show up in the cast and do more than a decent job. Ben Kingsley adds George Melies to the gallery of the great personalities he brought to life in his screen career, and Sacha Baron Cohen proves that he can be funny also out of his usual stand-up comedy style. It is however the complex and beautiful world in which the characters move will be the one that we shall remember from this film.",9,3,5,8 January 2013
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Best Action Movie of the Summer
","This is a summer action film, and if you approach it this way you will enjoy it. I liked it more than the other blockbusters of this summer. For a change there is a coherent story here, with the logic of a Terminator story, but still logic. The film is not too long, it does not have any philosophical pretentions, and you get what you paid for. Action is very well done, effects are first class, though there is no great innovation as in the previous films of the series who were classics of special effects. Acting is decent - playing robots makes the profession easier for Schwarzenegger and his female partner who do not belong to the Nicholson league. The only mis-cast is Claire Daines whose make-up and wardrobe make her look ten years older than her Connors boyfriend and future husband. Action movies fans should wish Schwarzenegger to lose the California race, so that he can make Terminator 4. Otherwise, 'Hasta La Vista...'. 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,0,0,10 August 2003
The Shining," slowly becoming a classic
","In the mid-90s I was fascinated by the Danish TV series The Kingdom. The story happened in a hospital which was a labyrinth building that played an active and determining role in the action - a structure built on unsafe ground claimed by ghosts and haunted by crimes of the past. I had discovered a great and original director named Lars Von Trier. Now 15 years later a discussion on the Internet list doubled by the coincidence of the screening of The Shining on ARTE-TV reveals me what may have been one of the sources of inspiration of Von Trier.The film is an adaptation of a book by Stephen King, although the writer had many reservations and critics about Kubrick's version, who took the characters and the basic story but moved the emphasis on what seemed to him to be more relevant and expressive. As in a few of King's other novels the principal character is a writer who hides in the mountains in order to find the tranquility for his creation, and finds horror instead and the tranquility and power of nature becoming soon a threat. Kubrick was no strange from the recluse position, as a few years before the making of the film he had retreated into an isolated house he had bought, actually starting a personal evolution towards the image of the great director with sparse output he took in the last decades of his life. The frustrated writer story is however only the surface, as we soon get into a much more complicated epic with multiple layers of horrors and incertitude, where family relationship drama, ghosts, haunted manors, supernatural powers interleave and place the viewer in the situation of never being sure from what perspective the story should be considered. The answer is that it is probably about all of these and more that would be revealed when thinking about the film after the projection or seeing it again.Jack Nicholson plays the lead role and this is one of his powerful creations in a type of roles in which insanity takes control not only of the character but also places under question the sanity of the whole world around him. The question critics asked was whether his stronger than life acting did not shadow completely the other actors and characters. His partner in the film is Shelley Duvall, an anti-Hitchcock female character (opposite to Hitchcock's blond and beautiful heroines). She was so overwhelmed by the work with Kubrick and Nicholson that her career crashed after this film. The musical score is dominated by Gyorgy Ligetti's Lontano but also includes other significant excerpts from Berlioz (directed by von Karajan) and Bartok. It is however the exceptional cinematography that makes this film unforgettable. As the hotel isolated in the mountains and cut from the outer world by the winter storms plays a central role in the action the filming of the deserted rooms in the huge and empty hotel (when it does not become populated by ghosts) provide the opportunity of an aesthetic exercise which is valuable in itself, but together with the acting and the music provides one of the most consistent visions in any horror movie I have seen. Always on the edge with technical inventions Kubrick used here the Steadicam which allows for a stable holding of the camera with unusual angles to film the kid running though the endless corridors from the lower angle of his toy. The effect is amazing.The initial reception of the film by critics was rather negative, adding to the cool reception by King. Themes like alcoholism or the disintegration of the family were considered as downplayed. My opinion is that they are there for anybody who wants to interpret the story through one of these angles but they are not the only ones possible. The very last sequence changes the perspective and provides a very different reading through which the film can be seen, one that has hints planted in some of the previous dialogs and situations. The presence of the native American as 'true owners' of the ground where the hotel is built is also mentioned in several sequences and provide an alternate reading. As time passed this film (which was also a commercial success from start) started to gain critical acclaim and gathered interest from aficionados of Kubrick and of the horror film genre. I had seen it for the first time only now but my impression if that as with many other good films it gets better at each viewing.",9,0,1,19 March 2011
"I, Robot"," would Asimov have liked it?
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS! I am a big science-fiction and Asimov fan. I was watching this film and asking myself - would Isaac Asimov have liked it? On one hand there is too little of Asimov's complex dilemmas that turns into screen. Little of the full world that one's imagination as a reader opens when you read Asimov's stories and novels makes it to the screen - or better said it's just a small fraction of this world viewed through the eyes of the script-writer and director. You are much less intellectually challenged by watching this film then by reading the books.On the other hand, this is still a glimpse into Asimov's world. The robotics law theme is taken into saying something about a menacing word where robots try to become the ruling power because 'they know better' then humans what's good for humanity. This does look like an asimovsque theme, despite the commercial treatment that it gets from the director. Some of the special effects are spectacular and pretty well done, although the inflation of special effects on the screen in the last years in action and comics inspired movies creates a competition hard to match. The robots behavior is very well rendered on the screen, and it's worth pointing that there is even a robot artist involved - Oana Bogdan, whose hand is behind many of the successful movies of this type. Smith is Smith, he is already more a star than an actor, and plays himself more than the character. There is a risk in this if crowds get tired, but that is his business.I do not believe that Asimov would have denied this film. It's good robot theme entertainment and this is not too little. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 on my personal scale, and I am waiting for the real great film inspired by Asimov to come sometimes in the future.",7,1,2,29 January 2005
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," sparkling and dusty at the same time
","I do not have the habit of apologizing for my guilty pleasures, and I will not do it this time either. From time to time I love to watch animation movies. I do it not only for the nostalgia of Walt Disney's masterpiece or to remember the pleasure of sharing the experience with my kids some time ago (it's the turn of my grand-kids now), but also because I believe that the animation films, like any other genre, have their own successes as well as failures. When it succeeds, good animation is an aesthetic pleasure, a source of emotions and thrills, a joy that we remember in time as we remember any other good films. But this is not the case with 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' - the latest success from the House of Marvel. And I will not argue with the success either.The more ambitious films of the comic-inspired genre are trying to bring new ideas to attract viewers, as even the most passionate fans of the genre need something new from time to time. In 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', not even this new idea is exactly original - I've already seen in quite a few other movies the heroes of different comic series as they were brought to the screen and combined as heroes into the same story. In this case, the heroes of the various variants drawn or derived from Spider-Man, including Spider-Man Noir and Spider Girl, are gathered in one place (Manhattan, where else). Parallel universes of different stories with spider-men meet for the pleasure of the connoisseurs. Those less familiar with the sub-genre characters will not get that much from this reunion, and the resulting action did not seem terribly interesting to me either.The result is, in my opinion, that we are dealing with yet another routine movie (animation movie this time), similar to just another magazine in a comics collection. For the enthusiasts it is important not to miss any issue. As an occasional spectator, nothing in the 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' seemed to me to be special, neither the animation nor the 3-D effects, neither the action nor the humor or the characters (the good or the bad). I'm sure this film will take its place in the collection and I am also sure that I'll forget it quickly. Its makers have been able to create something sparkling but already dusty before time.",5,3,18,3 February 2019
The Alamo," an American history epic - but not one of the good ones
","This is the genre the Hollywood movie should be at its best - historic film inspired by the American history. This film is not one of the best in its category. I actually am a history fan, but I am not very familiar with American history. Maybe I am close to ignorant on some respect, because I did not know before this film for example that Houston was a historic figure, and only vaguely knew about the Alamo. The problem is that the film did not help too much, and not being familiar with the characters of the period I had quite a hard time understanding the American characters views and differences. I have no complains, this is not supposed to be a documentary, but...Sure, for the external world the story of Alamo does not tell too much. Non-American viewers do not resonate to it the same as do the American viewers and the Texan war that touches American patriotic cords is for other just another war fought almost two hundred years ago between two remote countries. The way the characters are divided between good American and bad Mexican may be by default right for the American viewer, but needs more argument in the film for a foreign viewer. The way its done, it makes me suspect some kind of stereotype. The Mexican general is presented too stupid to be credible, and showing him merciless to the defeated and corrupt morally does not help. Neither are we explained well why the soldiers and volunteers in Alamo fought with such fanaticism, nor why do they not send their families to safety. There also is a missed opportunity for a great theme, with Sam Houston, having sacrificed his friends and fellow citizens for a bigger goal. However, if there was a moral dilemma for Houston in his acts, we are not shown it, instead we are instructed in his military tactics.Moreover, the film seems too long, not much develops in characters, and if you are not really in the military history not much happens here. I liked more the drama in 'Cold Mountain', to take another American history epic, it had more interesting and powerful characters. The best act in Alamo was by far the one of Billy Bob Thornton, he is really fun to watch, but not enough to sustain a really good film.'The Alamo' is a film to watch, but it does not exceed the level of mediocrity. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale.",6,1,3,23 October 2004
Wanted," canceling the laws of physics and morality
","I was expecting the American debut of director Timur Bekmambetov, the man who made the Night watch series, a fascinating and catching vampires meets Bulgakov film in the decadent post-Communist Russia. The result is quite disappointing, but no usual stuff either.You can watch 'Wanted' and enjoy it if you forget for the duration of the film both laws of physics and rules of morality. The story is of a secret society of assassins, working according to a code of rules and instructions received from no other than Fate itself. Killing is presented and I would not say say justified, but no question is asked about who writes the rules and what is the collateral damage of the actions of the society, in a film where more than half of the screen time is spent in motorized killing rampage. The annihilation of the laws of physics is of course another accepted feature of the comics genre, the effects are well done, remind to some extent Matrix without the astonishing visuals of the brothers Wachowski, while the innovations (curved trajectory bullet, a recovery bath that looks like some kind of a cement mold, etc.) seemed to me to be somehow naive.WHat about the movie itself? The dark cinematography was consistent, but the unidentified American metropolis looks less intriguing than the Moscow the director left behind. Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie do what they are expected. James McAvoy makes here another 'landed-in-a-foreign-world' type of role, same as he did in 'The Last King of Scotland' and ends by being the most incredible serial killer we are in danger to see again if this film is only the start of a series.",5,3,7,17 August 2008
We're the Millers," so predictable
","Jennifer Aniston was the nicest nice girl two decades ago, projected to fame by the 'Friends' series and by her publicized relationship with the nicest nice guy Brad Pitt. 'Friends' concluded after more than one decade of successful seasons, Jennifer is no longer with Brad, she is still one of the nicest in the comedy films country, but now it's time to play the mother. Or fake mother. Which is what she does in 'We're the Millers'.Premises are pretty good. David (Jason Sudeikis) has a profitable profession which now has become history - he's a weed dealer in Denver, CO. When he gets in trouble he is forced to become a drug smuggler which is quite a different and risky protection as we learn. In order to make it happen he needs to recruit the help of a neighbor stripper (our Jennifer) and of two teens in semi-trouble to fake a regular family crossing the border between the US and Mexico for non-chemical recreation. Troubles, of course, just start.The problem is that not only the troubles the characters are in or get into are predictable, but almost everything that happens in the movie can be told from start from a story or emotional point of view. The only unpredictable thing is how predictable everything is. Even the jokes are to great extent recycled, and director Rawson Marshall Thurber has almost nothing to add. The best comical part is made of the cut scenes screened after the end of the action and before the credits - do not leave too early! Jennifer Aniston is - of course - superb, and much of what I found written about the film was about how good she looks and what she did for this. Which is absolutely deserved, by her and by the movie called 'We're the Millers'.",5,4,7,4 July 2015
The Patriot," Patriotic Kitsch
","'The Patriot' is a good film by the norms of Hollywood, belonging to the genre of the historic epic drama. On the positive side it is well done, well acted, with quite a complex action line. On the bad side all is very expected,  many of the 'memorable' lines as well as the characters behavior belong more to low grade history books rather than to an artistic film.  It looks like cinema art did not develop after 'Gone with the Wind'. The film is also very one-sided in its historical approach, pro-American and anti-Brit. Being quite well done, no wonder that American viewers are moved and resonate positively, while British viewers may find it ultrageous  - see some of the IMDB comments. Mel Gibson is on some kind of programatic path with his creation lately, and I like less and less what he is doing. He seems to forget that art is more valuable and durable when political or religious propaganda are played lower key. Over all I watched the film with a mix of cinema enjoyment, and lack of comfort because of the too obvious historical and political message. Too much message, too little emotion. Curiously enough, 'The Patriot'  reminded me some of the films I saw in my younger days, in Communist Romania, where the propaganda machine was enrolling the cinema industry into making films in service of the official ideology. Worth seeing, but controversial for me - 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7,0,2,15 February 2004
Silver Linings Playbook," everybody's crazy
","I am trying to remember at least one character in Silver Linings Playbook who is not crazy in some way. You know, what we call a normal person, who is not or was not a patient in a mental institution, is not on psychotic medication, is not going to shrinks or a shrink himself, has no mania or obsession, does not live his or her life according to canned solutions prescribed by psychiatrists. Actually there may be one - Dolores, the mother of the deranged home where much of the action happens, splendidly acted by Jacki Weaver who also is hinted to be the deus-ex-machina of the sophisticated intrigue of rehabilitation of her son Pat (Bradley Cooper, much better than in any other film I saw him before) out of the mental institution where his stay seems to have been caused more by legal reasons than by health troubles. In the process of getting back his life, which includes for some reasons (never explained) getting back his cheating wife who was at the origin of all his troubles he will meet a new love (Jennifer Lawrence - great looks, average acting, but then she is really only 22). It's just that the Pat's system of reference (as the one of other characters in the film) is so much deformed by the stereotypes of therapy and legalism that seem to rule over the life of the heroes that only the rules of Hollywood good-feeling scripts succeed in bringing together the intrigue towards the end.It is certainly my problem that I am not a big fan of suburbs drama or of romantic comedies. It is the problem of the film that it cannot offer credible solutions to the problems of the characters. If this was real life there would be no happy character in this film. They live in times of economic uncertainty, lose jobs or run in-secure businesses. Family lives are buried in boredom and mediocrity. They are stuck in unhappy marriages. They are on medication. Even their American football teams do not do too well, and sport events turn into violent incidents with ugly racist facets. The aspiration to a positive attitude seems to be imposed and artificial. It's mean drama packed in the artificial wrapping of therapy and optimism, but the source of optimism is not clear. It sounds and looks superficial and artificial.There are many details to like in Silver Linings Playbook. Dialogs are extremely well written and acting is so natural that you feel that you are present in the suburb home, and that the characters are folks like the ones you met yesterday. You even forget that Robert De Niro is the actor who played uncounted number of gangsters, his maniac focus is so well targeted here to the obsessions for football and betting. Director David O. Russell makes the best of the neurotic ambiance and temperament of his characters and eventually drives the viewers in caring about them. It was not a bad film, despite the amount of clichés that outnumber the moments of real emotion, but I left the screening with a feeling of dis-orientation - serious problems are dealt with the wrong approach. A little bit like the issues the characters in the film have to face and the way they try to solve them.",6,0,2,6 April 2013
Van Helsing," a computer graphics Gothic film
","'Van Helsing' is a remarkable film from a technical point of view. Computer graphics in films became a major trend lately, and the borders between classic animation, computer animation and acting become more and more blurred. If you doubt, just see the four animation films in the US top ten this week, and computer effects playing a visible role in at least another two. As I said, I liked, actually was captivated by the endless imagination in the computer work in this film, and this kept me interested despite the length of the film. Sure, there is not too much originality in 'Van Helsing'. We get a very strong mix of many of the horror stories of the 19th century. The only original idea was re-defining the Vatican as the host of the bigger spy agency of the epoch. The film even has a Mister Q as an important supporting character. Acting is not too bad, but the quality of the film lies mostly in the Gothic atmosphere, the infinite number of monsters, and the landscape created by computer means. Certainly, it is just comics-level geography and history. Do not expect any historic or geographic truth here. Transylvania for example for whoever is interested is 500 kilometers away from any sea. But who cares. I enjoyed 'Van Helsing' more than I expected. However, I dislike the idea of a second film, and the producers would make a big mistake to try to create a sequel. It can't be better than the original in its genre. I am however sure that they did not wait for my advice, and are already doing it to capitalize on the momentum :-) 'Van Helsing' gets 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7,0,1,28 November 2004

","Based on a trilogy of books written by Veronica Roth, Divergent brought to screen by Neil Burger begins as many other similar dystopian films years after the civilization as we know was destroyed by war. One of the surviving pockets is the city of Chicago. In the retro-futuristic ruins that we know from many other films the local community survives by having itself divided into five strict casts, with well defined social roles - agricultural production, justice, social assistance, policing and defense. One has to chose once base on some kind of a hipno-test that detects his abilities and recommends the future path. There is no return. Outfits are thrown out of the system in kind of a homeless world. Those who do not fit into the patterns are feared, and eliminated when identified. They are the Divergents.The film is the story of one of them - a teenage girl who chooses to train to become part of the more exciting military-policing cast - or maybe two if we add her trainer who has one secret in his pocket - as they fight the system, try to adapt, but do not find their way of integrating, so they revolt. The premises are almost as strict as the social rules of the world that is being described in the film, and it would have taken quite a lot of talent and character building in order to overcome a simplistic approach. Unfortunately this is not the case, and the film hesitates between a future vision which is not original enough and a teenage fighting adversity story which is not complex or interesting enough.Director Neil Burger of The Illusionist fame quite disappoints here. I should say that he disappoints again, as after that 2006 movie he never got back to the level of story and characters building that he reached there. He never succeeds to exceed the clichés of the The Hunger Games genre. No, this is not supposed to be a compliment. Divergent is too much resembling many other films of its genre, the young Shailene Woodley and Theo James act well but they are no Jennifer Lawrence and the presence of Kate Winslet in a well built supporting role is not enough to save this film from a very average grade. Divergent is missing some more divergence.",5,1,2,7 April 2017
The White Ribbon," punishment and guilt as sources of evil
","The full title in German of the film is 'Das weisse Band – Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte' – 'The White Ribbon – A German Children Story' which could translate as 'story for children' or 'story about children'. A story for children it certainly is not – Michael Haneke is the author of some of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, and if there is some sense in age rating of movies, I would avoid showing his films to children under a certain age to protect them emotionally. It is a story about children, and the film can certainly be categorized in the genre of these horror stories where the Devil seems to be incarnated by innocence, and for sure a good one in the genre. Haneke knows how to create and maintain tension, how to film the real while suggesting the missing, how to pass the anxiety beyond the polish of civility. But the film tries to be much more.We are actually warned from start what the film is about. The story happens in the year prior to the first world war, in a rural area of Germany, where the social and moral system in place for centuries seems to have little chances to change. Peasants work the Baron's fields and gardens, the priest and the Church defend the existing order and the morals, teacher and priests are not more than associates of the existing order. And yet strange things start to happen, some get obvious explanations in the human conflicts, other remain unsolved – accidents, deaths, violent deeds. As the story is told by the teacher of the village many years after the events we know exactly the location in time of the events, and we know that the storms of history will blow up the whole system and apparent tranquility of life soon. However, before war starts the life fabric seems to deteriorate from inside, the whole society and its institutions – church, medical practice, family fife – are deeply sick.The thesis of Michael Haneke is not far from the one of the American author Norman Mailer in his book 'The Castle in the Forest'. As Mailer goes back into the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler trying to discover the roots of evil in his family life and sins of his ancestors, Haneke takes a more general approach and tries to discover the roots of Nazism in the internal conflicts, the puritanism, the unspoken dark secrets of the family life of a constrained society. Obsession with order and discipline, education by punishment and guilt, tight guarding of the appearances of morality without deeds being true to principles do not necessarily lead to the order and quietness that is aimed, but long term can generate quite in the contrary. In a society where speaking the truth and revealing the evil at small scale are less important than keeping appearances of social order the freedom is in danger and evil can develop at bigger scale.All this is spoken in few words by the off-screen commentary of the village teacher who tells the story, but is not explicit in the cinema language of the film. The impact of the film would not have been that deep without the master cinematographic treatment that Haneke applies to the story. First the black and white image fits perfect the world that is being described, and not only because its a world still lit by gas lamps, but also because the lack of colors reminds the classic German expressionist films that caught in the epoch contemporary or soon after the action of the film takes place the same type of angst. Then the acting is simply amazing. Many of the important characters in the film are kids or teenagers, and Haneke had to do a rigorous selection to select his best actors. he succeeded at utmost, I have seldom seen such a range of kids characters, each of them different, human, true. They seem to belong to their time, and to live through the painful coming of age, which is their growth into maturity in a world which becomes ugly.The tension between the not so innocent childhood they are going through and the adult world that tries to educate them by oppressing their feelings, punishing and inflicting them a permanent state of guilt is well acted and described beyond words.Haneke avoids to make a harsh judgment. The whole fabric of human relations is not dark, we do have a love story between the teacher and nanny and we do have the innocent gesture of a kid trying to give consolation to his father by making him as present the most important thing in his universe, which say that even in the darkest times and circumstances there is still hope that a flame of humanity is kept alive. He does not completely solve the mystery of everything that has happened on screen. As in real life some facts remained unexplained, and judgments, even historical judgments need not be fully radical, and and good that such it is.",8,4,12,6 February 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," a remake worth being made, but ...
","When I wrote about the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a few years ago I ended with a remark that I am concerned about the news of an American Hollywood version of the film. I still believe that the Scandinavian version of the first of Stieg Larsson's book in the Millennium trilogy is a better movie, but from many respects the American remake directed by David Fincher is a respectable effort worth being seen and watched even if you have already seen the original, and even if you are not necessarily a big fan of the author and the legend around him (which continues to develop as we speak).I was expecting to see what the director of Se7en, Fight Club, Panic Room, Zodiac, Gone Girl, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button will make out of the labyrinthine and cool (from so many respects) Scandinavian thriller. To my surprise he was quite respectful to the original story, and developed it better than the version directed by Niels Arden Oplev some of the detective story elements. The Agatha Christie heritage is so evident here that we did not need a Christopher Plummer in the cast to make it more obvious, but I enjoyed his presence. The Hollywood version is also more detailed in describing the social backgrounds of the two principal characters and this only makes their encounter even more charged when it happens. Did I miss something from what I was expecting from Fincher? Yes - the surprise, the usually close to the final twist that makes many of his film be something else than what you believed them to be when you watched them for the first time. Too much respect for the text sometimes harms.Despite being made at high professional level the Hollywood version stands one step lower than the Swedish one on several key aspects. One is the atmosphere. Whatever Hollywood cameramen do, snow and cold and the light of the North look and feel different in a Scandinavian movie, and the original dialogs and the soundtrack sounded more natural in the Swedish version than the English spoken words. The other is acting. It is said that Daniel Craig brought life into Agent 007. It may be that the dose of life needed to make James Bond a real person is not enough to make investigator journalist Mikael Blomqvist the man in Larsson's novel who overcomes his life being broken into pieces in order to find the truth. Michael Nyqvist who played the role in the Scandinavian film walked that inch towards fully melding into his character. Almost the same thing can be said about Rooney Mara's rendition of Lisbeth Salander - one of the best roles created in the last decade for a young actress. Mara makes us forget her other (nice girl) roles, while Noomi Rapace had made us forget that there is an actress behind the character.Despite being better than most of the Hollywood remakes of non-American movies, David Fincher's film stops one step apart from being as good as original, maybe at an invisible border that cannot really be crossed.",8,0,0,20 September 2015
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A good feeling comedy that is actually funny
","Judd Apatow is at his first big screen movie, and he hits it right. 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was an unexpected success on screens last year and it deserves it. The story of an aging geek who spends a mediocre sex-less life who is pulled by his work fellows into manhood and finds real love on the way could have fallen easily either in vulgarity, or in sweet and false romantics, or worse into boredom. 'Virgin' falls in none of these traps, it plays right most of the time by building a credible action, being sexy without becoming gross, and filling the time with a lot of memorable situations and one-liners. The two principal actors Steve Carell and Catherine Keener are not too famous either, but they succeed better than most of the first rang comedy stars in Hollywood lately to build a couple that has chemistry and makes us care about. The last 15 minutes of the film are maybe too expected, like the script suddenly ran completely out of ideas and borrowed from another thousand of Hollywood comedies, but the final musical like singing brings back the smiles viewers will end with watching this movie.",8,1,2,24 February 2006
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," out-Bonding James Bond
","I did not see any other blockbuster this summer, but I have the feeling that having seen the latest in the 'Mission:Impossible' series may have been sufficient for having seen the best. I confess that good action movies are one of my guilty pleasures, but I am quite picky on this respect. Besides the mandatory portion of attractive women and spectacular landscapes, the ratio between action scenes and story telling must not be too unbalanced on any side, car chases and fight and gun shooting scenes must be well filmed and fun to follow, the pace should be alert but still allow me to understand who shoots whom, and there must be action movies logic in what happens on screen, which of course has not too much to do with the real life logic. 'M:I 5' comes close to perfection on all these respects.Whoever followed the previous films know already that the writers of the scripts will not avoid doing a few things: make sure that Tom Cruise (alias Ethan Hunt) is on screen 99% of the time, that he will sooner or later fall in for one of the female characters in the story (Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson is on duty this time) with no good chances for a happy and long married life to follow, that enough countries and landscapes will be traveled during the movie than in a full season of a National Geographic series, and that some of these landscapes will be badly altered after our heroes visit them. This installment also continues the intrigue in the previous one, as the secret services department to which Ethan Hunt belongs is threatened by the more conventional services, which obliges the hero to go rogue and become the most chased person on the planet, followed by both the good guys and bad guys organizations.When all these happen on screen my first thoughts were to remember that this is almost the same script that was written for the latest James Bond series (with the changes of M, remember?). Actually under the hands of director and script writer Christopher McQuarrie the latest 'Mission: ...' looks more and more like a James Bond film, even better than one on some respects. Just listen to the variations of the music theme for example. The two series address now the same space in the movies spectators preferences and the borders are being effaced. It's good that the releases seem to be coordinated to avoid bringing to screen the new films in the two series during the same summer seasons. If the quality stays at this level I will not complain. This summer's 'Bond/Mission' was well written, alertly directed, Tom Cruise who gets near his mid-50s is in an acting and physical shape of an early 30-er, and even the stiff-as-usual acting of Alec Baldwin could not spoil too much, maybe because his role was of a stiff CIA boss. The bad guys were also quite schematic, and Cruise will need a more ferocious adversary in the next one. Yet – highly recommended to all fans of action movies – get your popcorn, sit back, relax and enjoy!",8,0,3,25 September 2015
Collateral," solid, well-acted thriller
","'Collateral' is a well done thriller, with an intelligent script, logic, pace (for most of the time) and succeeds to avoid many of the traps and clichés of the genre The action takes place in LA at night, and although the large concrete jungle plays a role in the action I feel the director could have done more with the location. Cruise as a paid killer on a multiple murder mission tries to break his positive characters type, and succeeds it very well, in a cinema season where we have seen other great actors Ike Hanks or Robin Williams taking the main negative role in movies with similar good results. Foxx is his positive counter-part, a cab driver becoming tool and victim of Hanks, and the strange and developping relationship between the two is the backbone of the movie.Not all is perfect in the movie. Some script details around are not as original as the main story, and the ending needs to wrap-up everything, and it does it in a sligthly commercial and disappointing manner. Overall it's a good film, worth watching, and not only in order to see Tom Cruise. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",8,1,5,7 January 2005
Dark City," dark and original, but aging quickly
","Alex Proyas made recently 'I, Robot' - a controversial version of Asimov's classic. I liked it and was in a minority. I believe that I may be in a minority again saying that 'Dark City' is an interesting film, with a lot of strong and original ideas, but also a fast aging piece of cinema.The theme of our civilization falling under the mind control of another civilization was repeatedly dealt with since 1998 when this film was made. Still the combination of detective story, mind control as in 'Eternal Sunshine', and alien contact, all filmed in a style reminding the 30 classic horror movies is interesting, but too heavy in my opinion to be efficient. The film tries to be too many things, a melding of too many styles, and falls eventually in a rather conventional ending, that cancels the surprises and tension built until then.Kiefer Sutherland's fans will enjoy seeing him in a very different role one second before '24'. Williana Hurt is as WIlliam Hurt as ever. The rest of the cast is good. What fail to make it to the screen are the graphics - the strong and original ideas of the movies are mis-represented using second quality graphics. If this was intended to be comics style, it's a bad idea because this movie tries to be more than comics.It's a film to remember, it's a different story than the usual science fiction stuff, unfortunately it's of the kind that fades rather than improves in time.",7,2,6,3 June 2005
Dunkirk," men at war
","I fail to join the chorus of praise from critics and many film fans for Dunkirk. I came with big expectation to this film, not only because I read the critics, but also because Christopher Nolan is a director whose work I enjoy, who tries and succeeds to surprise in most of his films, in very different genres. This is why Dunkirk, his tentative in the WWII films genre slightly disappointed me. To be clear, it's a good film on any scale. It's just not the best on Nolan's scale, IMO. I really hope that the race to the Academy Awards is not over (as some predict) and better films will show up in the race for the small statues.I am lacking in this historical description the element of surprise and innovation that Nolan brought to films like Memento , Inception, The Prestige, or even Interstellar. What we get instead is an almost docu-drama approach to a historical event that is known well enough so that we need not too much background information and we can face the individual destinies of the heroes. I liked the fact that for most of the film Nolan and the authors of the script avoided the heroic or melodramatic approach and presented war as lived by the soldiers, a bloody chaos which found the young men unprepared not only from a military point of view but also from a personal perspective. War is not a collection of heroic deeds but also or mostly a fight for survival. The trap of melodrama is not completely avoided however, and a few scenes to the end seem to belong rather to another film. So does the character of the British navy commander played by Kenneth Branagh - wasted talent. The other actors are less known and it's better so, as most are supposed to be the anonymous soldiers who fought for their own lives, some of them with success, some with less luck. A special mention for the excellent musical and sound track which helps a lot the cinematography which is also impressive at many moments.At the end of the movie, when some of the characters make it alive to Britain, the film leaves the personal contexts of its heroes to refer to the political context of the day, which is for us now the historical context. The trains with the survivors just start to make their ways and the politicians already use the events to push ahead their agenda. Their is a gap between the mess that they just had survived, and the words that describe the facts in the newspapers and in the Parliament. It was a necessary gap, however. Big war stories are built of small personal stories, that sometimes include fear and mistakes. The evacuation at Dunkirk was one of the key moment of WWII. The avoided disaster on the beach at Dunkirk prepared the victory on the beaches of the Normandie in the summer of 1944. The saving of hundred of thousands of soldiers after the 1940 Allied defeat in Europe allowed for the men under arms to be spared the sufferings of being war prisoners, allowed for regrouping of the forces, the defense of Britain and eventually the turn of fate and victory in the war. It was a key moment in the war. That was not enough to make of Dunkirk a great movie.",8,0,4,10 August 2017
The Intouchables," about bridging the differences, but in the easy register
","In the year when The Artist dominated the Oscars and achieved international success and recognition, it was a very different kind of a film that dominated the French box office. This film is 'Intouchables' and the one of good reasons of its success is that it deals with a problem that seems to be universally actual but especially painful nowadays in Europe and France specifically – the relation between the 'native' Europeans and the immigrants who migrate to the Old Continent in search of its freedom and chances of finding here prosperity and escaping the hardships and in many cases the prosecution at home. This encounter is an encounter of cultures and styles of life, which puts to prove everybody's capability to accept the differences and to live aside or even create stronger relationships despite the differences.The two principal characters of the film have each a strong handicap but also other strong points. Philippe (the excellent Francois Cluzet) is quadriplegic condemned to life in a wheelchair following an accident, but he has a wide culture and especially a lot of money which allow him to afford not only treatments, people to serve him at ease, living in a palace in the center of Paris, and flying on private jets to any place in the world at any time. Driss (Omar Sy) posses nothing and lives a life of a semi-criminal and semi-homeless, but he is young, strong, and has a natural goodness and common sense of the street. The two meet and complement each other, help each other with what the other is missing or has lost, but this is possible because the two share also the will to live, the taste of the extreme, and especially humor. The two directors of 'Intouchables' Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano made of this film a feel-good story that tries to pass in a comic and easy way a strong message that the differences can be bridged when and where we can look at the people near us, find their strong and good parts and offer ours to them to overcome the lower moments in life.The film is inspired by true people and by a true story, and here is where I feel a little bit cheated. I feel cheated because if this fact was not so visibly emphasized I would have criticized the film for being to idealistic, its characters too good to each other, differences and situations solved too easily, in other words I would have said that this looks too much like an idealized Hollywood story. Should I risk to do it now? Say that for example if Philippe was not so extremely rich to buy his entourage and way out of any situation by taking another fine meal or private jet flight this maybe would not be the same story. Or say that the final story with the anonymous girlfriend brought up at the exact place by the sea (Normandie?) where the two end to run seems too much like a movie-style 'deux-ex-machina' exercise? Or ask practical questions like who help Philippe take food or drinks to his mouth at that encounter? I would be ridiculous, as this is inspired from real life and characters, and all or some may be true. So I will just take the risk of saying that the approach to a very serious problem seems to be a little too idealized, but that overall that is a good feeling movie worth being seen, as there is nothing wrong to feel good even at films dealing with serious subjects.",7,6,11,2 June 2012
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," just a kids movie - a good one though
","I confess that I did not read any of the Harry Potter books, and I am afraid I will not have the time to do it during the current reincarnation of my soul. This being said, I am judging the film by what I saw on the screen, and I cannot refer to the many details the book afficionados seem to be that familiar with. My opinion is that this film belongs to the category of kids film, and should not be over-estimated or over-judged beyond. It is actually quite good in its own terms, and doing good kids movies should not be under-estimated in a world poluated with that many bad taste or plain boring movies targeting young audiences, unfortunately many claiming Disney descendence, or even bearing Disney labels. My young teen-age soon enjoyed the film, and so did my wife and myself. The good parts are the overall atmosphere, darker, and less surprising if you saw the previous films in the series, but still very consistent and catching. Computerized film graphics is by now an art in itself, and the makers of this film master it fully. I did not like that much the horse-bird character, which looks like being intended to generate some affection, but fails to bear a personality as some other recent film monsters.Acting is good, with the kids trio, now on the verge of their teen years growing up still as a consistent team, although Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter seems to have less acting resources than Emma Watson in Hermione, who may develop into a real screen star. Interesting to guess how the makers of the series will deal with the inevitable growing pains and crisis of the young actors. A good team of good and better actors surrounds the kids, with Michael Gambon having taken over the key role of dean Dumbledore after the passing of Richard Harris in a flawless manner.Sure, the fans can and will build a world around the books and the films. Even for the non-initiated or beyond the age groups, like the ones I belong to, there is enough good stuff to enjoy in this film. 8 our of 10 on my personal scale.",8,0,2,12 June 2004
54," Good Club Movie
","54 is above the avearge with its recreation of the late 70s club scene in New York. The story of a New Jersey guy dreaming of the big city, and making it to the center of the sparkling night life is quite well done, with a good recreation of the athmosphere and some truth in the psychology of the characters. Acting is fair to good, music is fun, and there is less melodrama than in similar epoch stories. 7/10 on my personal scale.",7,2,4,22 February 2003
Dallas Buyers Club," AIDS docu-melodrama
","'Inspired from a real story' can provide the premises of good movies and bad movies, or I should put it in different words - movies I like and movies I do not like. They are usually good when they aim higher than replaying on screen the facts but also succeed in extracting the human truth behind the journalistic truth. It's not only an issue of credibility, as reality surpasses fiction in many cases in creating incredible situations, and real life characters can be extreme to the unbelievable in good and evil. It's an issue of adding that minimal dose of emotion that justifies the decision of viewers who chose the movie channel rather than Discovery. It's just that it must be real human emotion.Combining docudrama and melodrama Dallas Buyers Club describes that moment at the beginning of the spreading of AIDS when no cure or even treatment to decrease suffering was available and the lack of information about the disease, its origins, ways of propagation was leaving space to prejudice. We still encounter this in some remote countries, but than, 30 years ago this was the situation in the developed world including main stream USA. Ron Woodroof lives the transformation between being the ultimate macho stereotype man, homophobic and ignorant to the stunned victim of the disease who decides to fight for the right to live his own way - which is also the way of the rebels in the American system in periods of pioneering. Actually America was pioneering new territory at that point in time with the initial initiative fighting not only the external threat but also the internal sclerosis of the medical and legal system.Yes, the acting of Matthew McConaughey is brilliant and he deserves the Academy Award that he may get for this role. Unfortunately this is the only artistic statement of quality in this film. The rest is enveloped in a package of melodrama, with a script that does not offer any interesting or surprising development, and director Jean-Marc Vallee and supporting actors Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto not succeeding to overcome the stereotypes and the melodrama. I was quite hesitant to go and watch this film which is out of my preferred genres and zone of comfort or entertainment, unfortunately the reasons to hesitate were justified.",6,0,2,21 February 2014
The Exorcist," a milestone
","I saw 'The Exorcist' 32 years too late. This was not the kind of films to be allowed in the Communist Romania of my youth. It's really a milestone in the horror movies genre.I dare say that if 'Exorcist' was made today it won't go controversy-free. In the current moralistic climate, and with the on-going debates about the role of the Catholic church, a film about Catholic exorcism would generate some debate. The thing is that three decades passed and as we got used with this one, we can argue now about the 'Da Vinci Code'.The art of the movie is to take the very un-believable story of a pre-teen-age girl with a deteriorating mental health and make us believe that the only logical explanation is that she is possessed. We would not believe it in real life, we truly believe it on screen. The means to achieve this artistic truth are mostly classical cinema, good story telling and solid acting but at the same time the film is revolutionary by bringing to screen for the first time elements of the horror genre that have become routine since then - levitation, psycho-kinetic capabilities, and especially the make-up that transforms the angelic Linda Blair into a demonic kid-monster.Director William Friedkin had 'French Connection' in his record when he did 'The Exorcist'. This was to be his last great film, unless the future will bring us surprises - he is still working, now in his 70s. But these two movies are more than most directors do good in their whole lives, and well enough to book him a place in the history of the seventh art.",9,7,10,5 June 2005
Now You See Me," magic fun
","I have somehow missed 'Now You See Me', a very entertaining movie directed by Louis Leterrier when it was released four years ago. Luckily, it's one of those movies that do not lose their appeal that fast, and then it's summer time, so the right time for fun and entertaining films. The only detail that seems overcome by time in this film is the usage of phones phones with geo-positioning systems.As smartphones took over the market, and applications as Google Maps became ubiquitous, the cops using keyboard based not-so-smart mobile phones seems to have happened twenty and not four years back. It's kind of a lesson for film-makers which may find more and more difficult coping with the pace of progress of our smart gadgets. Maybe the sequel avoids this mistake.'Now You See Me' combines two genres - the big robbery and the magicians movies, with more emphasize on the later. 'The closer you look, the less you see' is the key saying of the film which tells the story of four magicians with different specializations brought together in a team that combines huge magician shows a la David Copperfield with bank robberies. They are supported by a finance tycoon (Michael Caine), followed by a former magician (Morgan Freeman) whose pastime is exposing on TV the tricks and frauds of magicians, and have of course all the FBI and Interpol on their tracks. The roles of manipulators and manipulated, suspects and innocents change all the time, and as in a good magic show we are never sure what we exactly see on screen.The story may have a few holes that cannot be filled even by magic, but the convention works well, and is well supported by the actors. Watching Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine is always a delight in this kind of roles that they enjoy playing in this epoch of their careers. The rest of the team does a good job as well, with special mentions for Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. 'Now You See Me' is a film to enjoy, like a good show with magicians.",7,0,1,13 August 2017
American History X," powerful anti-hate drama
","'American History X' is nowadays almost a cult movie, one of the category that seems to get better with the time. This is probably because of the very actual message and the strong story of a family caught in the racial and gangs conflicts of the 90s Los Angeles. The messages that hate does not solve problems and that tentatives to reconcile cannot wipe overnight deep-rooted problems are still strong and universal, and the movie looks as actual as the day it hit the screens.It is also the best movie of Edward Norton, in the principal role of the pro-Nazi gang leader who kills two Afro-American who were trying to stole his car. He is shown the day of his liberation, trying to re-build his life and wipe over his violent past, but meantime he became a model for the racial hate groups in the neighborhood and for his younger brother. If there is hope beyond the violent conflict it's in the tentative of some of the characters to bring some sanity, but the message is open and the tragic end avoids the typical rose water endings of the Hollywood movies.I liked this film, it talked to me length about race conflict, hate, appeasing, forgiveness. As I said, it's more actual than ever. 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",9,0,2,30 April 2005

It is a pity to see him now making such a mediocre establishment movie.'Ocean's Eleven' is a well made action movie. It reminds many other similar action films, like 'Mission Impossible', gets together a bunch of very good actors, is well filmed and succeeds to be rather logical in its Hollywood incredibility. However, it fails to create any kind of real artistic suspense. Even as summer entertainment, it repeats too much of the already seen cliches to be really a good entertainment.

Underground," a strong metaphor about communism in the Balkans
","'Once upon a time there was country' - this is how this film starts, setting a tone of legend on what will follow - a long, breathtaking and heartbreaking allegory of 50 years in the history of Yugoslavia and the Balkans. Although the movie tells a lot about Yugoslavia and the internal fights leading to the civil war there ('there is no true war without brothers killing each other' is another memorable quote) the movie can be related to any other Communist country in Eastern Europe, kept for many decades in the 'underground', torn away from the sunshine of freedom.The film was made in 1995, in the midst of a period when Europe was coming together, while Yugoslavia was falling apart. It is not the historic accuracy that was the focus of Kusturica's work, but the need to tell to the world the story of a region that underwent so many conflicts and has seen so much human tragedy, the need to find an explanation for the world but maybe first of all to himself. One needs not relate to this film as to a documentary, his tools are not the ones of the reporter but of the artist.It is a long movie, but I couldn't complain a bit, so fascinated I was by the story telling skills of Kusturica, by the music which is wonderful and plays an important role as in all his movies and by the acting which brings to screen a full colorful world of characters and situations. A great film from one of the greatest directors today.",10,5,11,29 December 2006
Tropic Thunder," when the director dies first
","Funny things can happen when the director dies first while filming a movie. One thing for example would be that nobody believes the death is real, as it happens with the gang of failed actors parachuted in the South East Asia jungle while filming a Vietnam war action film, which will have to face real nowadays drug traffickers with their dubious acting skills as only means of survival. The result can be as in real cinema a blessing, a catastrophe, or something in the middle.'Tropic Thunder' is that thing in the middle. It's a funny idea.The film starts with a previews-like generic which is one of the best I have seen recently. It gathers a team of comic actors (Stller, Downley Jr., Black) that would each be able to carry a comic film by themselves. It includes one of the best cameo appearances that I have ever seen.And yet ... it is the supporting stuff that does not really work and does not connect well. The too many cinema associations and quotes are lost in the sound of explosions and gunshots. The irreverence of the politically incorrectness is expected. The too many changes of face and faith of the characters result in eventually having us not caring really too much about them. It's still a fair entertainment, not too funny but not completely failing easy. For Ben Stiller the director, if he wants to cross the line and stay behind the camera more often he needs to design more carefully the emotions of his other characters, or he simply needs to get even more crazy.",5,1,3,28 September 2009
Yesterday," 'All You Need Is Love'?
","If they create a category of 'best idea for a film' at the Academy Awards, 'Yesterday' directed by Danny Boyle would undoubtedly be a formidable competitor this year. The starting point of this movie, which is part of the wave of musical films that have brought this genre back to the preferences of the audiences in the last two years and made some nice cash as well is the hypothesis of a world in which the Beatles have never existed. Does this sound like a dystopia? To appease your fears I will add that after the imaginary event (but in fact very possible - an electromagnetic solar source pulse with catastrophic effects on people's memory and on the machines they created) a few other landmarks of Western civilization, including Coca-Cola, are almost forgotten by most of mankind. Well, Pepsi and the Rolling Stones survive, but I assure you that this is not a catastrophes movie.The film's hero, a mediocre amateur musician, is almost the only one on the face of Earth who seems to have been spared by this selective amnesia. When sharing with the people around him the Beatles songs, the cultural shock has mixed effects, but eventually they claim back the audiences on the planet, and also make our hero a world celebrity, one of those who fill the stadiums and sell music on all channels and available media. The first part of the movie works well, at least for those who know the music and agree that the genius of the Beatles is equivalent to that of Mozart. I'm not sure about the impact of the movie among younger audiences. I saw the film in a movie hall where part of the viewers were teenagers who were probably more familiar with the figure and music of Ed Sheeran (who has quite a substantial cameo role), and they seemed a little confused. After all, if you did not hear 'Hey, Jude' for several decades, why wouldn't it work as well, or even better as 'Hey Dude'?The movie asks explicitly or implicitly some questions about the Beatles. What caused their phenomenal success and the way they changed the course of pop and rock music in a few years of intense activity (compositions, recordings, concerts)? Just or mainly their music, or their personalities, their way of being and dressing, the scandals created by them and especially around them? The authors of the film seem to support the thesis of the importance of music, and hence the choice of a relatively anonymous actor (Himesh Patel) who creates a sincere and super-naive character, charismatic only through the music that we know well, does not belong to him. The Today of 'Yesterday' is our time, with the advertising machines and the image makers who can invent stars but can also destroy the lives of those behind the shining masks. As the story progresses, the movie loses speed and slips into little compelling melodrama which cannot be saved even by Lily James, the beautiful and talented actress, known from theater plays on the best English scenes.'Yesterday' is a must-see movie for Beatles fans. The first part is superb. The continuation belongs to the 'feel-good genre and, despite the attempts to preserve originality, it disappointed me a little. 'All You Need Is Love'? Perhaps that's not always enough.",8,0,1,24 July 2019
Resident Evil," A Well Made Microsoft - Zombies Film
","I do not like zombies movies. It's a matter of taste, but none of the after-death genres really speaks to me. I must however confess having enjoyed 'Resident Evil', especially because it is very well made - but I might have never seen it if I knew what it is about when I rented it from my local Blockbuster. This would have been a miss.The director, Paul Anderson seems to specialize in movies inspired by computer games (another sign of the culture of our times, but why not?). This is his second one after 'Mortal Kombat', and it works much better. His other sources of inspiration are Lewis Carrol's Alice, '2001 - The Space Odissey', and of course the other zombies movies in the last 20 years. The combination works, and I think that this is first of all because of the clear and sure director hand. The story line is of a corporate having almost total control of home computers ('evil' Microsoft comes in mind immediately), and performing secret biological weapons experiments behind the scenes. When something goes wrong, zombies are not late to show up and start eliminating the humans around. It's not especially original, but all is well linked, there are no major  flaws, and even the quantity of pretentious laughable quotes is beyond the usual limit.Milla Jovovitch and Michelle Rodriguez are the feminine stars in the movie, easy to remember as they are both beautiful and well-casted. The rest of the actors team are decent. Effects are well filmed, and provide the needed quantity of horror for the fans of the genre.The sequel is already in making, and I intent to go and see it.",7,5,9,8 September 2002
Quantum of Solace," fine actors cannot save one of the worst James Bond films
","Let me say from the start that Daniel Craig is one of the finest actors having played James Bond, maybe the best since Sean Connery. Judy Dench is also the best M. ever, and the idea of a female M. is just genial. Yet, the series are in trouble, and something needs to be done to save the series from the downturn that seems worst than the world economy.I will call the film QOS because the name requires a non-native English speaker to use a dictionary to understand it - and this is one of the many small problems that make a big disappointment. Another one is the unconvincing evil character. Another one is the lack of global threats in the intrigue - to justify the immense destruction and number of widows and orphans left on the track a James Bond movie must invent something more interesting than the water supply of Bolivia revealed as the big motivation way into the film. The action scenes themselves are well made, but too fast, too many, to confuse to help the viewers understand what is going on and care beyond the pure aesthetics of destruction.Bringing on the set fine actors and redesigning the character into a human being with real feelings as well as into a darker Bond fit to the world of today is a great idea. It is not enough though. Bringing good script writers is even more important.Oh, and yes, please bring back Q. and please have Bond say at least once 'My name is Bond. James Bond'. There is no such thing as a good Bond film without those.",5,24,32,27 June 2009
The Butterfly Effect," a future cult movie?
","I deeply feel that when it comes to real value and time resistance the audiences are better judges than critics. In this case, 'The Butterfly Effect' directed by two almost unknown newcomers got a good reception from viewers, including a rather high IMDb mark, while critics trashed it almost completely. I wonder what is the reason, and I ask myself if the instinct of the audiences did not see in this traumatized childhood to manhood story combined with alternate lives transitions something that critics missed.Much of the discussions were around Ashton Kutcher performance, and I dare say that in the absence of his off screen media exposure his performance would have been much highly rated. He holds this complex story on his shoulders, he does it with some doses of exaggeration at some points, but overall he is credible in the role of a traumatized young man, who is damned to change life lines more often than shaving.The theme is not easy, and the movie is not easy viewing. It can never be easy when childhood traumas caused by child abuse and their repercussions for the rest of the life are brought to scren. Due to the changes in the story line, each of the four main character goes through his own moments of ecstasy and agony. Yet, there is consistency in the story telling, there is both dramatism and magic in the search of the right path to take, there is credibility in acting and all these make of 'Butterfly Effect' a film to watch, that may last longer and better than expected.",7,0,2,28 October 2005
Alien vs. Predator," not as bad as I feared
","For some reasons 'Alien vs. Predator' has a bad name. Critics did not like the film. or maybe the idea of bringing together in one movie horror characters from two different flick series does not seem too original. Maybe so, but it was done before, and will be done more, I am sure. The film is not by far as bad as they say and I expected. I am a fan of the genre, and I would see almost all that was and will be put on screen in this genre, but 'Allien vs. Predator' has a consistent story, is not too difficult to follow, effects are OK, and the graphics are average plus. The original 'Alien' design was by the famous Swiss artist Giger, and the following films in the series including this one kept the cool repulsiveness of the original designs. Director Paul Anderson does not fall much from his original 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Resident Evil'. Main actress Sanaa Lathan is no Halle Berry, but I doubt that Halle Berry could have extracted much more from this role. The problem with the rest of the actors is the fact that they spend too little time on screen, and we do not really get to know them beyond the cliché, or even less. This is probably the main problem of the film - despite belonging to the horror-sci-fi genre it never succeeds to make the viewer too involved or too afraid. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale.",6,1,3,8 April 2005
No Country for Old Men," the Coen brothers are trying to be too over-smart for this genre
","I do like the Coen brothers movies, including some of the previous ones which were not commercial successes and were not so well received by the critics. Surprsingly, it is this film which seems to be universally acclaimed by critics and received high enough grades to make it in the IMDb Top 100 that left me with a partial feeling of un-satisfaction.On the good side the film really catches the attention with a strong visual style, and with a sophisticated structure which makes the multiple cat-and-mouse games played by the characters extremely enjoyable. It also allows for a tremendous performance by Javier Bardem for which he received a well-deserved Oscar, and another solid one from tommy Lee Jones - he may be somehow stereotypically cast lately, but he fits so well in the stereotype and becomes better as he gets older like god whiskey I dare say :-) On the bad side the film tries to play a little too much on the over-smartness side. I did not read the book, so I was left to guess key pieces of the action, and yes, life is full of mysteries, but I could detect no logic in how the Coen brothers decided what to leave out - these just looked like intentional wholes in the plot, obviously intentional because these guys know too well how to tell a story. The ending which was intended to be symmetrical with the beginning was supposed to give a different perspective to the whole story, but it did not really make me vibrate either. It is maybe because the combination of the genres of violent gangsters conflict, greed and hate motivated pursuits and the western setting do not really rime in my mind with the kind of philosophy Tommy Lee Jones' character was articulating in words at the end. Some more simplicity would have yielded into an even better film, IMHO.",7,3,7,30 September 2008
District 9," better than 'Avatar'
","If there ever will be an Oscar for the best science-fiction idea to be turned into a political film 'District 9' is a certain candidate. It takes the theme of the third degree encounter, but reverses the relation between the human and the alien races into a very unexpected manner. The aliens arrive indeed in their gigantic ships, but their place of levitation is neither a coned mountain nor the lawn of the White House, but the slums of Johannesburg. Neither do the Aliens look like ethereal blue-men, nor like naughty gremlins, but they are rather a frightened and disoriented crowd which looks in shape as disgusting prawns, who do not seem to enjoy often showers either. Placing them in the slums that South Africa is very familiar with looks like the right thing to do, and nobody is surprised when racial riots break up between the 'superior' humans and the new 'inferior' race visitors. True, the 'prawns' as they are called do have the military technology you would guess, but it's only some kind of teenager nerd of theirs that holds the secret of saving the oppressed race.Released in the same year as 'Avatar', 'District 9' carries a similar message of intergalactic tolerance pleading for the need for dialog between cultures, for mutual respect despite differences in language and behavior. It probably cost only a few percents of the hundreds of millions Cameron could invest in his blockbuster. However, after putting aside the outstanding visuals of 'Avatar', 'District 9' is a much better film.Talking about visuals, I liked the atmosphere that first time director Neill Blomkamp created for the slums. The pseudo-documentary style fits well the story logic, and the use of TV news allows for action to be re-created with an air of authenticity, enhanced by the propagandist media speak coming from the comments. Actor Sharlto Copley is perfect in the role of the inept bureaucrat Van De Merwe put in charge with moving the aliens to a new relocation camp. He acts well the coming back towards humanity of his spirit in parallel with the metamorphosis to alien his body is going through. Overall this film is a good surprise in the genre coming from an unexpected cinematographic territory.",8,0,7,28 June 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," epic stories need not be painfully long
","I hope that director Dominik takes this advice. The 2 hours and 40 minutes length is the principal problem of this 'Jesse James' screen story. It is not difficult to imagine a shorter version of this film and you get a much better one.The very good news are Casey Affleck. Dare I say he is a better actor than his elder and more famous brother? Yes, I dare. I could not identify for a long time Ben Affleck in the crowd. Casey is both resembling physically to Ben, but also has a personality that strikes at first sight. His acting as Robert Ford, the young, fascinated and treacherous killer of outlaw Jesse James is deep and emotional. He matches the much more experienced Brad Pitt, who is giving himself an outstanding performance as the charismatic and suspicious Jesse James at the end of his criminal career and life.It is really a pity that the director having created the good acting and beautiful cinematography of the film seems to have become so much in love with his own creation that he did not want to leave out anything. What resulted is a full two hours which are becoming repetitive, a lot of characters that look and behave too much of the same just to come down under the bullets of a Jesse who understands he cannot trust anybody any longer. Surprisingly it is the last 20 minutes which avoid the film from becoming a more complete bore with the story of what happened to the killer after the assassination. The too long elegy until that point is balanced with a condensed and expressive epilogue. In most other films this post-ending would occupy just one scene of half minute. Here it saves the dayIt is interesting to see a non-American director in charge with such an American film and story. Dominik brings the fresh view that takes out of routine a genre as the Western. If only he could have resisted the temptation of making the film long as an American screen saga.",6,2,4,12 June 2009
Batman Begins," best of Batman ... maybe ... but not much more
","Yes, this is the best film in the Batman series. It's not that hard, though, as the previous ones were just comics films, with mega-stars playing childish action. This film tries and to a certain degree succeeds to be a little more - meaning it has a story, some characters development, good cinematography (although not that impressive as in 'Van Helsing'), and some good supporting role acting with names like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson in the cast. On the bad side, Chriatian Bale is even less charismatic than the guy who played last summer in Spiderman, and Katie Holmes never succeeds to make us believe she is a DA deputy, or that she succeeded to get engaged to Tom Cruise.I wonder what made a director like Christopher Nolan, who directed the strong and original 'Mememto' and then had Pacino and Robin Williams sharing the screen in 'Insomnia' go that down on the artistic scale. Oh, I forgot - money, money, money...Yes, this is the kind of entertainment that many will enjoy and let them be happy. No it's not a bad film. But it's not a good one either.",7,1,2,5 July 2005
Meet the Fockers," big stars doing kitsch
","I confess I do not like Barbra Streisand, except when she is singing. I never understood her diva status and I do not buy that she has big comic talent. She worked very little in the last twenty years, did only four films or so, and if she was planning some come-back 'Meet the Fockers' failed to be the opportunity.The film is based very much on ethnic stereotypes comedy. It can be funny sometimes, especially when characters and situations help - but this does not materializes here, despite of the promises. All the situation is so unreal, the conflict is schematic and predictable, that the best comic scenes of the movie - and there are a few - are gags completely unrelated to the subject, which could figure in any other comedy film.De Niro and Dustin Hoffman can do no harm, they are too good actors to be bad whatever they play, and they probably enjoyed doing this film. I personally do not like Ben Stiller, I do not find him interesting or funny, and this film did not make me change my opinion. Streisand's character is supposed to provide the counter-weight to De Niro's toughness and meld him by the end, but because of the lack of chemistry between the two all the ending seems even more artificial than it is. A lot of stars talent was spent in this film, but the result is below average Hollywood kitsch.",6,0,1,9 July 2005
Man on the Moon," great acting from Carrey but nothing new about Kaufman
","This is one of the greatest roles Jim Carey has ever made, and certainly a role he did enjoy. The story and character of Andy Kaufman, erratic stand-up comedian who refused to be considered as a comedian, who shocked the audiences with his behavior and tricks, and manipulated them up to the point that even his tragic malady and early death were considered a farce by many fit very well Carrey and gave him the opportunity to mix his facial and body expressions with a tint of tragedy and a feeling of permanent search for a more depth truth beyond his clownesque acts. Add to this Danny DeVito's performance - also one of the best in his career and we have all reasons to consider 'Man on the Moon' as good entertainment.And yet I also had a feeling of exploit watching this movie. I never heard about Andy Kaufman before, but after having made some Internet investigation I got the feeling that the film tries to match quite closely what have been the more spectacular moments in his career, without adding too much information about who really Kaufman was. Sure, Carrey's act is more than efficient, and the story is told fluently as you would expect from a fine director like Forman, but the almost documentary remake of Kaufman's schemes, the involvement of some of the people who were really engaged with Kaufman while alive and the homages and unfit ending gave me the feeling that the authors did not really have something new to say about Kaufman but rather try to play on the same story and characters as twenty years earlier. This feeling did not have the fun one must have had watching Kaufman's real acts.",7,0,0,16 August 2007
The Pianist," One of the best Holocaust films ever
","Holocaust movies are always tough to watch for me, and I confess my lack of capacity to be objective on this respect. Trying to re-tell the un-speakable in the format of popular entertainment is impossible, and I have a hard time avoiding the emotional aspects and mastering my personal feelings. 'The Pianist' is one of the best movies in the genre. The comparison with 'Schindler's List' is immediate, as both films look at the Holocaust from the angle of the tragedy of the Jewish people with personal or family connotations for the directors, as well as they bring the perspective of the True Human Beings who risked their own lives to save the lives of individuals threatened by the Nazi death machine. In my opinion both films are very good, some of the best cinema two great and different directors of our times have ever made.'The Pianist' is a good film by all criteria. Although some editing cuts would have helped in avoiding repetitions, it never ceases to be shocking and emotional. Adrien Brody gives a great performance, and the camera work is great, with a classical touch reminding us that Poland gave some of the greatest cinema artists of our times. 10/10 on my personal scale.",10,0,1,2 January 2004
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Mendl's Cakes
","Cakes made at the Mendl's patisserie play an important role in this film. They are sweet round things, with an appetizing and improbable shape and pastel colors which emanate sugar. They are made by a sweet girl and delivered to the Grand and Imaginary Budapest hotel on the peak of the mountains of an Europe that ceased to exist, or maybe never existed but in the imagination of writer Stefan Zweig and later taken over, amplified and brought to screen and to us by director Wes Anderson. A reverence to a world of beauty and aesthetics, of culture and respect, of honor and pleasure of living which is crushed by history, same as the world of Jewish Austrian writer Stefan Zweig was in the events of the second world war.The story written by Wes Anderson freely develops the themes and atmosphere of Zweig's writings without being specifically based on any one, in a fantasy which extends beyond the historic boundaries of the life and works of writer. Europe survived the war but could not recover its history, its style, it's human quality. If buildings survived they are condemned to decay, if men survived they are reduced to their shady selves. What is left is to remember the world that was - now retreated back in a past that looks more and more like a fairy tale. And fairy tale is what we are served on the screen, albeit a very fun and entertaining ones, and there are many reasons to like this picture even without philosophizing too much about its deeper meanings.One of these reasons is of course the cast - one of these exquisite gathering of stars that usually get together only on the Academy Awards night. Shining over all is Ralph Fiennes in the lead role, and I will stop here but I ensure you that even if you recognize some of the faces you will find out that most of them do something different and in a different manner that you always knew (Edward Norton may be the notorious exception). Second is the amazing visual world created by Anderson which coupled with the camera work gives the viewers sometimes a 3-D feeling (although no special spectacles are involved), and in other cases seems to play with the dimensions of the rectangular screen extending them at will. Third and neither last nor least the settings contribute to passing to viewers the flavors of well-being of the times that went away.Stefan Zweig did not survive the war. When the world he loved crumbled crushed under the boots of the Barbarians he committed suicide. This film can be read like some kind of revenge. At least in the fantasy space created on screen by Wes Anderson a world similar in feeling, manners, colors, smells and tastes to the one Zweig loved survives. A world like Mendl's cakes. Almost poisonously sweet.",8,2,6,25 April 2014
The Favourite," the favo(u)rite of the race to Oscars
","I confess that Yorgos Lanthimos' films confuse me. Each one that I've seen approaches a well-known genre, starts from premises that seem familiar to us, as moviegoers with some experience, and gets totally elsewhere - in territories where the laws of decency or morality as we know them do not work anymore. It is obvious the director's effort to shock through the language used by his characters, but also through his own cinematic language. The result is a collection of movies that belong to the space of the bizarre, but also have obvious quality and which remain in the memory of the spectators. This is also the case with 'The Favorite', which has become an unexpected favorite (the game of words is unavoidable) in the race to the Academy Awards this year. It's a period film. A period film of a kind never made before. A period film by Yorgos Lanthimos.Queen Anne does not have a great name in England's history. She was eclipsed by other queens named Elizabeth or Mary, but the historical period and her historical role are not to be missed. She was the last queen of the of the House of Stuart (but a Protestant) and the first Queen of Great Britain. Her physical and mental health problems resemble those of her successors to the throne from the House of Hanover. Visually, the costumes and sets created for Yorgos Lanthimos' film reconstruct the atmosphere of the palaces and the royal court at the beginning of the 18th century with an accuracy and care to details worthy of the best films of the British studios or of the BBC. The characters that populate the film, or rather the Lanthimos version of the historical characters, are however far from being conventional representations. One might say that this is a strong feminist vision. The court and the political intrigues are dominated by women, but those are women who have suffered the traumas of persistent sexual harassment and rape since their teenage years, and who take their harsh revenge on the world of men. The sickly queen (played by Olivia Colman) reigns as the absolute sovereign playing as her mind or moods dictate with the matters of state and with the prime ministers and the Parliament, with the help of her favorite Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and of the newly arrived Abigail (Emma Stone). The main thread of the action is the conflict that opposes the current favorite to the younger woman, who will have to overcome the differences in social status and the hostility of the queen's councilor in order to take her place in the queen's circle and even closer to her.'The Favorite' has many qualities. The acting of the triplet of actresses is phenomenal, and the relationships of this 'triangle' dominate the story, evolving gradually and convincingly. Some of the scenes and some dialogues have formidable humorous sparkles. I've already mentioned about decors and costumes. Lanthimos's spices however add nothing meaningful and interesting, on the contrary, they appear to be forced and obviously inserted to attract attention. I did not think the film needed those. If showing lesbian ties may be considered as an original perspective on the queen's personality and the relationships the the royal court, the avalanche of profanities does not serve anything. Not only is it not plausible that the ladies at the court of the Great Britain in the 18th century have so often spoken words such as 'f ...', but this adds nothing to the characters or to the historical vision. I'm far from being pudic, but I think Lanthimos's vulgar insertions here are devoid of logic. The result is that 'The Favorite' is a movie with many good parts, but which does intend to be liked. I appreciated parts of it but I did not like it. It will be interesting to see if the Academy, with a renewed participation, will reward boldness, or rather pursue its Puritan reflexes and punish the film despite the high number of nominations.",8,12,20,6 February 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," growth pains
","The Mission Impossible the Bond series share growth pains. They are both making huge efforts to adapt and behave nicely in the new millennium.It's not an easy task for series whose characters, rules and conventions have been written originally in novels of the 50s, or in TV series of the 70s. They both answer by building darker stories (in the mood of the pessimist start of the millennium), hiring new actors (with the exception of the eternal Tom Hanks of course), and new directors who put the emphasize on building flesh and blood characters, humans who can feel pain and sorrow.Directing is trusted in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol to Brad Bird whose all previous successes were with animated movies. I cannot say that this is felt at all, or at least I did not detect any flaws in the fluency of the story telling or the work of the actors which are as little cartoonish as a MI-series film can be. The story this time has the quality of being well written, keeps the number of characters almost to the minimum needed and thus is easy to watch. We are still jet-flown in a handful of different countries, impossible infiltrations and games of masks are still part of the action, messages self destroy and at least one symbolic building is badly damaged - but there is an overall effort to make the intrigue, the relations between characters and even the extreme situations more credible, and this effort is mostly successful.Acting is exactly what is expected. The only regret is that Michael Nyquist has no real role and not enough screen time to demonstrate the huge talent we admired in the Scandinavian version of the Millennium trilogy. Tom Cruise who turned 50 this year is more and more involved in the MI series, he is here not only the lead actor but also the producer. One difference between the Bond and the MI series is that Ethan Hunt's role was never undertaken by another actor but Cruise, while at least five actors featured in the 23 Bond films. Of course, Cruise is still in great form, but the problem will be on the table maybe two series and ten years from now and the question is whether the MI series will over-live Cruise's aging. We shall live and we shall see.",8,1,2,14 December 2012
Revolutionary Road," Leo and Kate riding the boat again
","One decade after American Beauty Sam Mendes directs another strong melodrama located in the American suburbs, going back in time to the mid of the 50s at the time the powerful suburban myth and way of life was born. Mendes is cruelly X-raying the feelings and the conflicts of the generation that exited victorious from the war, enjoyed the post-war prosperity and fathered the baby bloom, a generation that made it materially but seemed to fail emotionally and culturally, falling into conventionalism and emptiness which only the late 60s flower generation will wipe away.As principal actors Mendes brings back together Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, the royal couple made famous by Titanic. This film seems to a certain extent a negation of the big love story in Cameron's blockbuster, and Leo and Kate's act make their relation in the film dramatic, credible and even memorable in its best moments. Actually the whole cast is wonderfully chosen and another performance to remember belongs to Michael Shannon who is playing the hospitalized son of the neighbors who under the cover of his mental problems plays the role of the Shakespearean fool, telling the truth in face of his guests.Great acting and some memorable cinema scenes like the starting train ride and parade of hats from the suburbs to the city at the beginning cannot yet make from an interesting film a great one. The principal problem of 'Revolutionary Road' seemed to me to be the theatrical setting of many of the dialogs in the film. The evolution of the relationship between the two heroes, the emptiness of their lives, and the failure to fill them with content are being told in scenes that may looks better on a Broadway stage but less on a cinema screen. It's really a shame, as Mendes seems to be a creator really capable of strong visual impact. However, the two talents of Sam Mendes visual expressed and directing his actors cannot get together to make of 'Revolutionary Road' the great film it could be.",7,5,8,4 April 2009
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," computerized graphics cannot put soul into these apes
","Amazing how many times can Hollywood try to squeeze the idea that triggered in 1968 the 'Planet of the Apes' series. The original film starred Charlton Heston and led to four sequels in the few years after its original release. A remake by Tim Burton with Mark Wahlberg in the lead role was made one decade ago. And now we have 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' which in my humble opinion is technically sophisticated but lacks much of the quality and ideas on which the original films were based.The evil human origins of the world dominated by apes were the nuclear apocalypse in the original film. The new evil role is nowadays taken by genetics research and medical corporations. Experiments on apes for a drug that can heal the Alzheimer disease go wrong and one smart ape triggers a revolution. The family-adopts-ape plot is extremely simplistic and not much complex then in scores of films and TV shows we have seen in the last few decades. Even so the film which is directed by Rupert Wyatt feels much longer than its 105 minutes.'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is certainly technically amazing. The imaging technique used already in such films as the 'Lord of the Rings' series or in 'Avatar' allows human actors to dress into fantastic shapes while keeping expressiveness and emotions. Here this technique is brilliantly used to create the main chimpanzee character (Caesar) and the crowd of apes, each gaining individual traits. Unfortunately the more sophisticated the technique and the virtual characters the less expressive are the human ones. There is not too much talent to be wasted in the characters of the scientist played by James Franco or his girlfriend played by Freida Pinto, and the best human performance is given by John Lithgow as the Alzheimer disease-stricken father.It is said that 'Rise of the Planet of Apes' is the smarter entertaining film of the summer. I can only imagine how bad must be the other. You can certainly lie back in the chair, and enjoy the popcorn and the apes. Not much more. The scariest thing is that the signs are that this film is the first in a new series.",4,7,16,27 August 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino and Hollywood hit back
","What do Quentin Tarantino and Pedro Almodóvar have in common? A lot, of course. First of all, both are among the most important film directors of the generation with which we have the chance to be contemporaries. Each of them released on screen at the Cannes Festival this year a film that deals with the world of film and its heroes. Films belong to the category I call 'movies about movies', an apparently narcissistic preoccupation of cinematography, but one that has resulted in many memorable films. Apparently Almodóvar's film, 'Pain and Glory' is more personal, many of those who saw it defined it as autobiographical. I dare say that Tarantino's 'Once Upon a Time in ... Hollywood' is largely a personal film, which tells a lot about the American director who is still threatening us to put an end to his film career. It tells it of course, in his own special style. The Tarantino style.The most frequently heard criticism of this film is the one that claims it is too long. Maybe it's a justified claim. Maybe out of the 161 minutes of screening, 20 or 30 or 40 could have been cut out and then there would have also been a better balance between the two episodes that make up the story, episodes which take place six months apart, in 1969. But I must confess that I enjoyed each of these 161 minutes. Tarantino managed to transport us in his version of that year at the end of a decade that transformed America and the world, into the universe of the movie studios and in the Hollywood streets populated by famous actors and hopeful extras, by hippies and riches, a puzzle of bright kitsch and contrasts. I enjoyed the episodes from the films and television shows of the time, and I enjoyed sharing with the character of Sharon Tate, the starlet with a tragic destiny, in the darkness of a cinema hall the spectators' reactions to her acting in a supporting role in her last movie. Tarantino was only a child that year, but his insider vision over time, the combination of reality and imagination, between vintage films and his own implants works very well.Tarantino also provides to Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt the opportunity of some of the fine roles in their fine careers. DiCaprio is fantastic in the role of the actor who feels his career is fading out and that his age catches behind before he managed to impose himself as a great star. His character is a combination of kitsch and self-doubt masked by boasting. Pitt ris his partner, a very Tarantinoesque role, and he again demonstrates the good reasons why he is the director's favorite actor. Even Al Pacino finds the opportunity in this film to play a sapid and important supporting role in the story. For much of the film, we have the illusion that Tarantino has renounced explicit violence as a means of cinematic expression. The last part of the film proves us wrong, the ending is spectacular, one of these that we expect from him, spectacular not by the graphics of violence (which is not lacking) but by ideas. Same as he has recovered in other well-known and controversial historical episodes, such as World War II and the Holocaust or civil war and slavery, Tarantino does not hesitate here to rectify history and to make justice, the way he knows to do it, a la Hollywood. Exaggerated? Implausible? Let's not forget the title of the movie. Fairy tales can be a source of serious lessons but the genre is not obliged to adhere to historical truths. In addition, we can, at any age, enjoy their beauty and charm.",9,10,21,22 August 2019
Django Unchained," Tarantino vs. Spielberg
","I saw yesterday Tarantino's Django Unchained. The film deals approximately with the same historical period as Spielberg's Lincoln, but what a difference! Spielberg and Tarantino are without any doubt two of the most important American directors today. Both come from the let's call it commercial cinema like let's say both had remarkable blockbuster successes which translated into financial success enabling them to produce and direct everything they dream. Both use this success to explore with their personal craft tools, style and talent - various genres which they change and put their own imprint in. Both made films about the Second World War and about the Holocaust, and now about U.S. history, and the horrors and abolishing of slavery.Concerning the movies about the Holocaust and the Second World War I think Spielberg and Tarantino are tied at the highest possible level. Schindler's List was impressive and Saving Private Ryan is simply the best war movie I've seen, while Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds rewrites with a Tarantinesque chutzpah and expressiveness one of the final pages of the history of the Second World War.Lincoln and Django produced me completely different reactions. Spielberg appears to wish to say by all means that 'I can do serious films' and the result is Lincoln - a rhetorical film, in which characters make speeches even when they are in bed with their wives, a film in which I miss the thrill of discovery and emotion and the fluency of the story telling I love in Spielberg. On the other hand Tarantino tackles that time in history in Django with his usual boldness and lack of complex, he uses violent action cinema and makes a deep reverence to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns. The result is a sparkling film that is both fun to watch and passes the message.This is certainly a violent film, but maybe I should say something about Tarantino's violence (on screen) the way I see it. The exaggeration and complete lack of realism in the violent choreography of Tarantino's movies is his way of saying - do not take me too seriously. There is something more in this film however - the introduction creates the message of abhorrence towards slavery in a manner at least as efficient as Lincoln's speeches in Spielberg's movie.There is a lot of good cinema in Django which makes the film enjoyable also for the passionate of quality cinema. Jamie Foxx's rendition of Django, the liberated slave who turns into a professional killer in order to save his wife is dark and compassionate at the same time. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson are a fabulous pair of surprisingly bad guys, and Tarantino himself and Franco Nero show up in minor but memorable appearances. And the story telling ... well ... it's good like in the good Spielberg movies.Django is my preferred 2012 film about the period of abolition of slavery.",8,1,3,6 February 2013
Drive," a beautiful love story disguised as a violent action movie
","Certainly, 'Drive' is a thriller. A different and unexpected type of thriller. Whoever has seen this film will remember maybe the story line, and a few action sequences, some of them extremely violent. They will remember first of all the two principal characters and their almost unreal lover story, they will remember the calm and focused look of Ryan Gosling (we never get to know the name of his character, he is just the Driver) which blurs into tenderness when he crosses the restraint smile of Irene (Carey Mulligan). One kiss followed by a violent kill, this is the only physical contact the two will ever make on screen.It may take a good 30 minutes for the viewer to decide what this film is about, but then things become clear. It is the most impossible and most beautiful love story we have seen in a while, disguised in a violent action movie. He is a stuntman, and a potential race driver who does not get to the race tracks, but races for burglars, helping them escape the location of their crimes. She is her floor neighbor, she has a kid and a husband in jail. When things seem to converge to some domestic low class drama located in the non-privileged area of Los Angeles, the husband returns from jail, gets soon into trouble, and the Driver is the only one who can potentially help him. Or drive him to his destiny. From here the second half of the film becomes one of the most violent I have seen recently on mainstream cinema, all packaged by director Nicolas Winding Refn in 70s style cinematography mixed with classic cars races.The sincere and straightforward acting and the day to day appearance of the main characters make the violence (and there is violence!) even more striking. And yet, the overall impression 'Drive' left to me was of one of the most sensible films I have seen recently, with emotion surging up from a very unexpected place. My only problem is that I am not sure to whom this film would be recommended. Action films fans may find a little bit too sentimentality here, romantic movies fans may be shocked by the violence. To all, give this film a try!",8,11,18,9 January 2012
2012," ultimate disaster?
","After having destroyed a few times on very big screens Manhattan, Washington DC, the United States and the whole North America it was time for director Roland Emmerich to get to the ultimate stuff - destroying the planet. What better pretext to do this than the Mayan prediction that the end of the world will happen on 12/21/12 - neither sooner nor later? So here we have the Hollywood version of the Apocalypse with no angels or saviors in sight, humanity is on its own. Sun and planets align, the core of Earth overheats, the crust cracks and the whole humanity is swallowed by huge earthquakes and tidal waves as high as the Himalayas.Well, almost the whole humanity. As in any other disaster films we do have our handful of survivors, some are bright scientists and some just your neighborhood mid-class Americans who will raise to the call of the hour. Inevitably there are some smart kids, ex-es who cancel their ex-ing one minute between the end of time and an American president who is too good or too smart to be elected but in the movies, etc., etc. Does this seem known? Well, because it really is. It's the same old, tired formula, and dialogs are worst than in many other such films, and situations are less then less than credible. But maybe the end of the world is not credible. Or is it? If the script of 2012 is an unbelievable collection of clichés and dialogs competing for the most stupid lines ever said in a movie, the viewer is left with the special effects and on the good side these are really first class. Of course, everything is completely incredible, but the fun of watching the heroes escaping the sinking of California in the mother of all cars chases, or the series of monumental tsunamis destroying all the wonders of the world plus the UNESCO-protected monuments one of the other is undeniable. A 5 year old can fully enjoy this film. Most 15 years old will consider it crap. Those older then 55 (me included) may also enjoy it provided that they place themselves in the mindset of 5 years old kids.",4,0,1,9 January 2011
The Number 23," this was a comedy after all ... oh, it was not??
","I love Jim Carrey's work as a comedy actor, but I can understand his wish to play at least once a 'serious' role, to prove that his acting skills are valid in other acting registries. Problem is that unless your name is Tom Hanks or Robin Williams this is not an easy task.In the case of 'Number 23' there is another problem, at least for people like me who have a very hard time in believing that occult sciences or theories like numerology are anything else than fraud in real life and good pretexts for horror stories in literature or on the big or little screens. Many great thrillers are based on these, among other my number one science fiction series of all times 'X-Files'. What happens there is that the acting style required by such movies needs to be very restrained and controlled in order to have the maximal effect on viewers, in contrast with the terrible things we witness on screen. Restrain is however one of the least skills in Jim Carrey's acting repertoire and this is the principal reason of his failure in this film. His indecision or impossibility of controlling the grimaces we so well know from 'Mask' or 'Ace Ventura' combined with the lack of any day-to-day logic in the story made me at some points hesitate between the options that maybe director Joel Schumacher made some smart parody and all will end with a laugh and the option that this is just a failed thriller with a huge miscasting in the principal role, a miscasting voluntarily assumed. Unfortunately, the later hypothesis is the real one.",4,0,2,6 October 2008
Ghost Rider," Peter Fonda is giving up his motorcycle
","Peter Fonda will certainly remain the hero of the most famous motorcycle movie made ever, but here he plays a very different role, joining the gallery of famous Hollywood actors who have played the Devil. And the Devil is using a motorcycle because we are in the 20th century comics universe, however the rider is Nicholas Cage acting as the Devil's head-hunter.'Ghost Rider' is a combination of Faust, cheap popular culture, computer effects and comics-deep characters that works to a certain extent but also shows deeply the limitations of the genre, or of the mix of genres I should say. It is the choice of a fine actor like Nicholas Cage with good supporting roles from Finda and Eva Mendes that makes the combination even more obviously look like badly mixed. Cage's melancholy is disturbing in every scene he is in, but is not convincing and not in tune with the quantity of muscles on his body and the spectacular action around. The ending is badly written, non-convincing, and if it was meant to signal the start of the series it did not ignite at all for me the wish to see the follow-up installments. 'Ghost Rider' is not bad, but is far from the other Fonda motorcycle movie.",5,1,2,30 September 2008
The Lives of Others," different perspectives
","I am born and have lived much of my life in communist Romania. There is a difference I think between the way I and other like me have received this film and the way it was received by folks who were born or lived most of their lives in countries where dictatorship is known only from news, books or films. The very existence of a repressive police machine that supervises every aspect of private lives, that suspects and follows its citizens with the purpose of detecting any act or tendency of political disobedience, up to intervening brutally in their lives may be news for the occidental viewer, but not for us.On this revelation for the unsuspecting viewer is based part of the impact of 'Das Leben der Anderen'. Another side of the secret is the human story, the story of good people in the bad 'democratic' republic of Germany. Geor Dreyman (acted by Sebastian Koch) is a successful writer who succeeds to become successful and to live a reasonable style of life by compromising in his play-writing of theater about factories and workers. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a Sasi captain who receives the mission to supervise Dreyman, not so much because of political reasons but more because a Communist minister wants to eliminate him as a rival to the favors of his beautiful actress girlfriend. Paradoxically, the two, although no strangers to the limitations of the regime are also the only true believers in the movie, trying to find its good parts, and to match them with their own personal ideals. However, the totalitarian brand of socialism practiced behind the Iron Curtain is nothing but a police system trying to keep in power the party dictatorship, and the only way to be true to the personal ideals is the the two characters to commit treason. Dreyman will write a 'subversive' article and send it to the West, Wieser will secretly cover him and will reveal to no one the dissident change in the writer's approach, at the risk of his own career.There are at least two memorable scenes in the film. Inone of them a young Sasi officer tells a political joke, and is being heard by one of his superior. The boss plays a cruel game with him, threatening him to destroy his career and then apparently joining him with the laughs. We do however see later that the forgiveness was apparent, when in a later scene we find the young officer sent to a lower grade of work by opening and reading private mail of the citizens, together with Wieser, punished for his lack of vigilance in the Dreyman case. It is however no usual day, it is the day the Berlin wall fell, and we see the Stasi officers whose role was suddenly canceled abandoning their place of work and exiting from the dark underground room to the outside world.I liked less the general conception of the movie, which tries to satisfy the needs of commercial cinema. It looks like made with the Oscar for the foreign film in mind, and it actually got it. The final scenes that happen years after the fall of the Communism, and try to provide some kind of forgiveness and especially the very last scene seemed very untrue to me. The suffering and scores of lives destroyed by the communist regimes in Eastern Europe scarcely deserve this kind of forgiveness.",8,3,6,25 December 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," All Times Oscar for Effects!
","Reading the comments of my fellow viewers I remark that having seen the film in the first days after the release I shared the experience with the hard core fans of the series. Not being one of them (until now at least), I can just comment of the quality of the film making. In my opinion, it is an extremely well directed film, superb camera work, and greater effects I have ever seen. If anybody doubts that computer effects became an art of its own, her/his doubts will be dissipated by this film. The complexity and perfection of some scenes looks like a big work of art, and the comparison coming to my mind is to Brueghel's or Bosch's paintings.However, the story is very complex. The director decided that the whole film will be just one piece of art, broken into three slices of three hours each only by commercial reasons. This median series starts and ends in the midst of the story telling. Well, having been busy the last year with a few other things - among them seeing many other movies - and not having read the book, I had problems in getting much of the action and characters development. A short recollection of the previous series action would have helped, and I recommend it to distributors for the next  time. They can of course, take it out for the big nine-ten hours screening in cinematheques of the future times :-) People who read the book were mixed in their reactions. Some say that the book is richer in characters and philosophy, and the movie loses something. Well, this happens with most books adaptations. I think that in this case, there is a lot the screen adaptation has added as well. But I will certainly buy and read the book now! It is still a good movie, one of the best of the year. I said good, but not great - only 8/10 on my personal scale, which I think will end being close to the real and deserved average mark of this film, after the initial fans enthusiasm cools out.",8,0,0,23 December 2002
The Incredibles," incredibly entertaining
","Let me start by saying that animation movies are not my genre. Shrek or Nemo movies seem to childish to me to spend one and a half hour of my time on Earth, yes I am aware that I may miss something, I was told it. I was however intrigued by the success of the 'Incredibles', rented the DVD and I am not sorry. It's pure entertainment, no pretensions, but still as good entertainment as many of the comics-inspired films I saw lately. Of course the imagination and creativity of the animators is key in such movies. Computer enhanced techniques help tremendously in creating a few characters that are better than similar cast in actor movies. The action is however somehow childish and with a better written story this film could have crossed the threshold into being good cinema, but still it's amusement of better quality than many other films lately. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",8,0,3,1 April 2005
I Am Legend," last man on earth meets zombies
","'I Am Legend' is a combination of two genres - one of the apocalyptic post-atomic/post-lethal virus stories with the sub-genre last_man_on_earth and the zombies movie. Here Will Smith is apparently the last survivor in a Manhattan that had been again Ground Zero for a different type of catastrophe. He is the only healthy survivor I should say as the rest are men and dogs made to look like flesh-hungry hordes of zombies by the epidemics that destroyed civilization permanently menace him and his faithful dog. It is actually the first part of the film that I liked most, the Manhattan_after_civilization looks well and scary, and Will Smith is doing a fine job, we always knew that he can carry a full film by himself. Conveniently he is also the biologist who can cure what remains of mankind, and when it proves as expected that he is not that alone in sanity on Earth the film slides to a more conventional and moralistic path. Not enough to spoil it completely but bad enough to lower my grade for this film from 'very good' to 'average plus'.",7,0,0,22 June 2008
School of Rock," School of (love for) rock
","'School of rock' is the type of movie dedicated to a sector of life, which you will not enjoy really if you do not like the respective sector. This time this is about rock music, and as a rock music fan I enjoyed the film a lot. Still I am aware that rock music apart, this is just a 'feel good' film, a little above the average comedy. Just last week I gave a lower rate to 'Master and Commander' as the naval history epic says me nothing, and the film - which many enjoyed - seemed just boring to me. Many will have the opposite reaction, I am sure.There is a message in this film about an aging and fatty rocker stealing a teacher job, just to turn his elementary school class in a band of rockers. The message is that rock music is a way of life - and it is presented as a superior one, and a culture revolution - which is is presented as positive and significant. Some may dispute these points, I happen to agree.
Jack Black is not the greatest comedian on earth, but he acts with passion. The kids succeed to be less sweet and conventional  than you would be concerned, and this is certainly the director's merit. Music is fabulous. If you like rock, you may love this movie. If rock tells you nothing, avoid! 7/10 on my personal scale.",7,1,2,15 May 2004
Kick-Ass," wild ride
","The heroes in 'Kick-Ass' are not made of special forms of matter and are not un-breakable. They try however to live to the ambitions of the super-heroes myth in a world which seems to believe in myths, and take the superhero life-style paths. Of course, when regular people act as super-heroes they can also get hurt, especially as they are at different levels of evolution in their training. A dad and his 11 years daughter seem to be the most advanced, with a high-school teenager who is actually the main hero following them bravely on the same path. Another teenager rather seems to be on the dark side, but he also tries the funny costumes and the weapons of the trade. The names of the heroes are Big Daddy, Hit Girl, Kick-Ass which seem like warnings not to take things too much seriously. There are some background explanations, but these do not count too much. The general tone of the film is on the comic register, a combination of superheroes parody and teenager growing pains comedy but the mix becomes lethal when it comes to action scenes. These are actually as violent as you can get in a Tarantino movie, and the scenes featuring the father training his 11 years daughter to become a killing machine (even if for the good cause of justice) risk to upset anybody who stops for a second to reflect at what is presented on the screen, and takes the subject too seriously and out of the nonsense territory.The film does also belong to another genre - the 'how could Nicholas Cage pick such a role?' one. With all due respect for the film, which is actually a well made, well paced and entertaining movie if you can overcome or you do not care about the moral aspects, Cage's presence in a supporting role in which he walks most of the time with a ridiculous thick make-up is wasted time for his enormous talent. That's certainly just a (big) fan opinion. Otherwise you can accept the convention and just enjoy the wild ride.",7,3,4,8 July 2012
Unknown," despite what critics say
","I usually rely on the opinions of exquisite movie critics like Robert Ebert or James Berardinelli and it seldom or almost never happens to be in disagreement with one, not to speak both of them. Luckily I usually read critics opinions after seeing the film and so I did in this case as well, because I may have chosen to skip one of the most intelligent and well written action films I have seen lately. The story is not only well written and the pace of the action kept me on my edge for the whole duration of the film, but it also has logic and is credible, so I dare say that the two great critics got it wrong when they gave the two stars out of four treatment to the film.The first sequences of the film introduce the viewers in the American-Has-Trouble-In-European-Big-City genre, with Berlin playing the role usually assumed by Paris. The hero is a biotechnology expert which in the first few minutes of the film loses his suitcase, his wife, and his identity. The losing of the identity is soon to be turned into the kind of situation where not only the hero starts to doubt his own self, but also the viewers start doubting what they have seen, or searching for the hidden signification. Another man has taken his identity, his wife seems to have become part of the plot or maybe she is forced to be one, a lot of people try to kill him, and whoever helps him is in mortal danger and does not survive much time on the screen. All this happens in a frozen Berlin in winter, and is filmed with a blueish filter that creates a metallic light atmosphere that just increases the anxiety. Acting is exact, Liam Neeson will not get another Oscar nomination for this role but he succeeds to make us care for him and so does Diane Kruger in the role of the woman who helps him, to find her life blown-up together with her flat in the action.This is the fourth film of director Jaume Collet-Serra, whose first film, a piece of horror name House of Wax I also enjoyed. He proves here that he understands the rules of the genre and can make well-paced and efficient movies. The quality of the film comes however first of all from the quality of the script - Unknown is simply brilliantly written, the terrorism and Cold War sequels intrigue reminding Le Carre's novels provides a logical explanation which put for me every event in place in a story of lost memory and identity that could belong to the Bourne series. My preferred critics were wrong this time.",7,1,1,3 September 2012
Gran Torino," moralistic suburbs melodrama
","Clint Eastwood's character in Gran Torino is one of the less likable good guys recently seen on screen. Recently widowed, retired automobile worker Walt Kowalski is a lonely man, non-communicative neighbor, non-committal Catholic, badly mouthed and with a tendency of racism towards the Asian neighbors who came in numbers to settle his neighborhood. His sense of justice is initially focused towards keeping any other human beings' feet out of his lawn. This until events in the neighborhood will force him take a stand and get him to know the true human face of his neighbors.The theme of the WASP American confronted with the newcomers in the increasingly multi-racial and multi-cultural society of today's America is the same as in the wonderful 'The Visitor' that I saw a few months ago. Yet, everything that was there subtle, unexpected, hinted, is here in 'Gran Torino' direct and trivial. Eastwood's Kowalski acts as and old incarnation of his cowboy roles three or four decades earlier. His understanding of the neighbors is never in harmony with their culture for which he keeps a permanent disdain, it is always in his own terms. The cultural integration is not perceived as a bilateral and respectful process, but as a series of lessons in 'the American way', meaning rude language and macho behavior. At least the screen story has the wisdom of showing this way as failing in real life. The final resolution of the conflict has a very moralistic tone, with a Christian symbolic nuance that may work on the screen but in real life would be less credible (there is probably more than one gang in that suburb area, right?).Clint Eastwood is a living legend, and at his age and stature he can do whatever he wants on screen. He does it his way. To my taste, when dealing with the tough problems of inter-racial relations and social problems in the American suburbs his ways do not work too well. It's maybe because the cowboys ways do not work that well in these situations.",5,9,18,28 February 2009
Hero," one of the best movies in its genre
","'Hero' is one of the best movies in the genre of Asian historic and martial art films, and one of the best movies that I saw lately. The story line is quite familiar to the fans of the Chinese and Japanese film fans - a mix of legend and history from the far Chinese past. We have seen it many times especially in Japanese movies. What is different and special here is the smart use of flashbacks in the story, re-creating and re-discovering the story with new twist every time. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, one of the best I have ever seen. The fight scenes are good - I am not a big fan of the human flying effects that reign in the genre in the last ten years, but the fight scenes in this film are more than just physical fights, they are confrontation between the characters, melt in same as the dialog ad the rest of the action. The moral of the story makes sense, and is beautifully translated in cinematographic language. I also like the atmosphere of Oriental mystic - certainly commercial, but at least coming from the real source. Indeed, China is the source of some of the best cinema in the last years. The film gets 9/10 on my personal scale.",9,0,0,2 July 2004
The Hurt Locker," playing dices with fate
","William James (acted by Oscar candidate for best lead role Jeremy Renner) is a character that is hard to forget. He is a soldier whose expertise is to defuse bombs. He played dices with fate more than 800 times and won each time. When he enters a bomb threat scene he walks directly to the target, with the sure straight walk of an American hero. His enthusiastic commander officers believe that he does 'hot sh.t' and congratulate him. His soldier fellows think that he is crazy and that he endangers himself and the other carelessly. When asked how he does it he shrugs and just says 'I try to be careful and stay alive'.William James is different from his fellow soldiers. Those are not heroes. They are just normal people, young men doing their tour of duty in Iraq, counting back the days to the end of the tour, and hoping that they will survive it. They are professional, well trained, but not heroes, and they work in a hostile and paranoiac reality, facing a country and a culture that they do not understand. Every civilian can be a terrorist, shooting can start from behind any sand dune or from around street corner, any bag, any car, any corpse can hide a bomb, any situation can escalate into violence.The situations in the film are not totally new for those who have seen previous films about the Middle East conflict, and especially the Israeli films 'Beaufort' and 'Lebanon'. As in 'Beaufort' the soldiers are equipped with all possible armors and technical gadgets that make them superior militarily, but their superiority is apparent, as victory is not at hand because the reality around does not allow for military victory. They look as aliens in a hostile world. Same as in 'Lebanon' most of the soldiers are disoriented, cannot find the familiar milestones in a reality that speaks and behaves differently than the logic of their human experience.'Hurt Locker' is 'Beaufort' and 'Lebanon' re-written and directed with the skills of a Hollywood professional.One of the best scenes in director Kathryn Bigelow's film puts the hero in the situation of trying to find the parents or relative of an Iraqi teenager killed by rebels, and whose body was bobby-trapped with explosives. In a typical Hollywood movie hero gesture he tries to find ways to tell the story of his death. Iraq does not behave however according to the classic film rules, the tentative turns into misunderstanding and almost ends in tragedy, and only a hysterical escape of the armed soldier hero saves his life. Dialog seems impossible, human relations are poisoned by the hate and mistrust injected by the political situation.Do we get to understand the motivation of the character? Actually never. The invincible hero has a family and a life that expects him after the tour of duty. When he is back home his wife does not understand his war stories and would rather have him slice the vegetables and fix the roof, and his kid does not really know him. His only thrill has become the war, actually an addiction, the addiction of playing dices with fate. We never get an explanation of the hero's personal evolution in this strong and subtle anti-war movie . His tragedy started long before the action of the film starts. He is a victim of war as all the other.The film was nominated for the Best Film Oscar. If there was any cinema justice on Earth 'Hurt Locker' should win rather than 'Avatar'. Yet, I do not think that it holds any chance in the competition with a film that made maybe one hundred times the money.",8,3,9,8 February 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," Problematic, Better Than Expected
","I was not supposed to like this film at all. I am not a fan of 'heroic' movies, and Tom Clancy books and films belong for me to the popular science shelves. However, I found 'K-19' to be a more interesting and in some ways better than expected movie. The film is based on the true story of a Soviet atomic submarine, going through an emergency situation in the early 60s. The subject is a good opportunity of asking some questions about the futility of the fate of very young people sent to serve in the Army (whatever Army), about characters reaching the hysteria of heroism, about the fight between discipline and common sense in a military environment. In the 'good Hollywood tradition', it does it but it goes only half way from an artistic point of view. Director Kathryn Bigelow is good in rendering the claustrophobia of the submarine life, and avoids to the possible extent the stereotypes in directing her actors. Peter Sarsgaard has a fantastic scene when doing a young officer terrorized to sacrifice his life to save other's. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are as good as you can expect. The problem is in the total absolution the film gives to Harrison Ford's character, and indirectly to the cause the characters were sent to fight for. Yes, they were heroes. Yes, they did their best for what they perceived as a just cause. Does this turn them into models in today's world? The Hollywood treatment for these Soviet era heroes does not help in answering any of these obsessive questions. 7/10 on my personal scale.",7,2,4,21 June 2003
The Illusionist," great creation by Norton raises an average magician story
","'The Illusionist' is a film that was often compared with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' which had a similar theme inspired from the life of the turn of the 20th century magicians and was released about the same time. It fails the comparison I am afraid.The story takes place in the last decades of the Austro-Hungarian empire, where a magician of modest origins is using his skills to fight the system and win back his lost love who is to become the wife of the crown prince. The intrigue is quite simplistic and the characters around the main hero are all schematic, with the exception maybe of the chief police inspector played by Paul Giamatti who oscillates between fear and allegiance to the system on one side and curiosity and search for truth on the other side. So it falls upon Edward Norton to save the film, and he does it brightly. It's his best role until now in my opinion - he is dark and subtle, sensible and articulate. While 'The Prestige' will probably remain the better film about magicians of that year, Norton will stay as the better magician in the two films.",6,0,2,26 December 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," no Forrest Gump
","This is an ambitious movie, and it will enjoy I believe success especially with the American audiences and with the academy members grabbing a number of Oscars (but I hope not the one for the best film deserved I think by 'Sinedoche, New York'). It is Oscar stuff with a story located in America (New Orleans filmed at its best) spreading over decades, with greater than life characters. Or I should say greater than time in this case.The ambitions exceed even the usual American saga story. The script written by Eric Roth, script-writer of 'Forrest Gump' and loosely inspired by a short story by Scott Fitzgerald tries to tell deeper things about the relativity of the passing of time, the inevitability of death even if time runs for the main hero from old age to childhood, about the power of love to transcend time. Yet the ideas as interesting as they are do not all find a cinematographic equivalent on screen, the result being a film with many memorable parts but also with failed ones.I did like the story telling in the first part of the movie, the many simple stories and moving characters coming together, but I had the feeling that there were too few new elements or surprises in the second part to justify the almost three hours film length. I loved the setting of the city of New Orleans, which filmed across many decades provides a fabulous landscape of color and passion, sounds and mist where all legends are possible. I liked the acting of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, each of them would deserve an Oscar, but overall they did not come together perfectly in a story that needs intense emotion and perfect chemistry in order to overcome credibility problems. Most of all however the feeling on mission incomplete derives from the fact that not all the ambitious philosophical messages found a cinema equivalent on screen.At the end this film does not stand the comparison with Forrest Gump, the other story of a different type of hero located in the Southern hemisphere of the American universe. The reason is maybe the fact that while Tom Hank's Forrest Gump carried the innocence of permanently rediscovering the purity of the world through the eyes of his character, Benjamin Button's recession into young age and childhood lacks such innocence and keeps a taint of sickness and uneasiness failing despite Pitt's magnificent acting to take us viewers with him into his universe.",7,1,2,3 January 2009
Men in Black II," Get in Mood, and Go with It!
","This is not big cinema art. It's a sequel, so it cannot be too original. However, if you know what you bought tickets for, and if you get in the right mood, you can really enjoy it.MIB 2 repeats many of the original gags in the original MIB. It does it with enthusiasm, and adds sufficient new effects to make the whole film enjoyable. Tomy Lee Jones and Will Smith have fun, and this is so obvious that it makes us join eventually. The comic arrows are still on the science fiction and cheap press, and the film is almost completely lacking vulgarity - which makes it palatable for children (or better their puritanic parents).And yes, there is a fresh new character - a Princess! - leaving an un-finished romantic line by the end. My guess is that this is the sign of a future MIB 3, and we might have a WIB in it!",8,0,1,4 September 2002
Hidden Figures," math and prejudice
","Very few films were made until now about the beginnings of the American space program, and I am wondering why. Here is a true American saga that took place at a time that is still remembered by many of us. It's a story with famous and anonymous heroes, a story that begins with the dismay and fear caused by the Soviets taking early lead in the race to space (with the launching of the Sputnik and with sending the first man in space) and ends in triumph with the Apollo program and the moon landings. And yet, Hollywood still has to approach the period and make the movies about this great story and the men that made it possible. Hidden Figures only partly fills some of this gap, looking at a little known aspect of the first space programs, from a specific perspective, with the emphasis on an unexpected and unknown aspect - the racial prejudice that faced and had to be overcome by the first Afro-American contributors to the program. It tells the story of (until now) little known heroes who not only were 'colored' but also all happened to be women.Hidden Figures is a fiction film based on the nonfiction book Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, written by historian Margot Lee Shetterly. The script authors and director Theodore Melfi where extremely careful in the details, from dialogues that aim to be as close to reality as they are remembered by the heroes who lived the period (including apparently a scene that looks very Hollywood-like but apparently did happen, with John Glenn on the launching ramp of the very first flight asking for the computations to be checked by 'the girl' he met in the preparation meetings room) to details about how buildings, corridors, rooms, parking lots looked at the NASA compounds in Virginia. What is shocking today especially from a non-American perspective is the extent to which segregation and racial discrimination was part of life and of the books of laws a little more than half a century ago, in the country that was leading the democracy block in its fight against Communism, and was working to send its first men to space.Yet, the 'inspirational' tone dominates the film, and the viewer has the feeling that almost every fact, action, or spoken dialog is in line with the point that the film aims to make. A more realistic or neutral approach would have made the message more convincing IMO. I did like the characters development, the fact that three women who are the lead characters in the film have each her own personality, talents, way of overcoming prejudice. The three actresses are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe and I hope to see them in more (good) movies ahead. Kevin Costner and Kirsten Dunst are cast in supporting roles and they do a good job. Hidden Figures is a solid and in some places emotional film, but cannot break the convention of genre and style that it seems that the authors imposed on themselves.",7,4,9,6 April 2017
1917," immersed in ww1
","I'm afraid that I saw yesterday the movie that will win the Academy Award for Best Movie this season. I wrote that 'I'm afraid' because '1917' directed by Sam Mendes is an extremely technically ingenious film, impressive in cinematography, and belongs to one of the thematic categories loved by the members of the Academy. I could not help but be impressed by the visual aspects of this film. But I didn't feel any emotion, no special interest and no intellectual challenge when watching the movie. In a season blessed with many interesting, original and exciting films, '1917' risks to steal the show and the big prizes - Best Director and Best Film - as it already happened at the Golden Globes. If it happens at the Academy Awards, in my opinion, it will be a shame.The story is between simple and simplistic. Two English corporals from the First World War trenches are sent on an almost suicidal mission to communicate to an isolated division the order of cancellation of an attack that would have attracted 1600 British soldiers in a tactical trap set up by the German enemies. The lines of communication had been cut, and the English generals had not thought of using aviation (already existing, as will be seen) to convey the message, because otherwise the story of the film would not have had any pretext. The film describes the race against time and death of the two soldiers, in the fields of fire, mud and death of the war.I used the verb 'to describe' but what happens is that the spectators are close witnesses of almost everything that happens during the two hours of action, and the merit is the technical ability to use the long frames (although not really one shot as sometimes advertized) and the close camera perspective. The most appropriate term can be borrowed from the field of virtual reality and it is 'immersive experience'. '1917' represents a formidable immersive and cinematic experience, succeeding in introducing its viewers to the nightmares of the war trenches. However, the action is simplistic as in a trivial action movie, the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypes are not avoided, and even the presence of well-known actors in the role of the commanders who send soldiers in the risky mission fails to elevate the film to a human dimension. The comparison with the great war and anti-war films related to ww1 makes no sense. Perhaps also due to the technological promotion of the film, the viewers are prepared to watch the movements of the camera and forget (or have not many reasons) to feel emotion. I think that '1917' deserves the Academy Award for cinematography that it will get. But I'm afraid he'll get a lot more.",7,1,3,11 January 2020
Lincoln," Abraham Lincoln deserved a better film
","'Lincoln' is one of the bigger favorites for Oscar Awards this year and will certainly be one of the heroes of the evening in Hollywood a few weeks from now. It is made by one of the greatest directors of our time, it tells a big American story and features a big American hero, it enjoys some fine acting and is very accurate in searching into history and retrieving a moment and a story that continues to impact the American social and political fabric until today. And yet, 'Lincoln' did not turn to me into a cinema experience to enjoy. Actually something interesting happens with my relation with Steven Spielberg. The film I liked most is one of his first – the very little known Duel, a minimalistic masterpiece, followed by the wonderful Close Encounters  and E.T. I enjoyed the Indiana Jones and The Jurassic Park series for what they are meant to be – great entertainment. However my personal experience with his 'serious stuff' is mixed. While Saving Private Ryan is for me the best war film ever made, and Schindler's List is one of the best in the Holocaust genre, other stuff looks sometimes pretentious, sometimes too naive. As much as he tries to prove, Spielberg cannot do films about any subject, I mean he certainly can, but not all are that good.Most of the action in 'Lincoln' takes place during the month of January of 1865. After four years of Civil War victory is quite close for the North, but the ending would have been meaningful only if the 13th Amendment making slavery illegal was adopted, making the reason of going to war and the temporary judicial war decisions part of the Constitution. Timing is critical, as the nation is tired and aspires for peace and recovery, and without the adoption of the amendment the end of the war may mean a compromise that leaves slavery in place. Abraham Lincoln will make all possible political maneuvering in order to have the amendment pass, in a Congress where he did not have the required majority. There is an interesting dilemma here about using 'unclean' political means in order to achieve a just cause and this is one of the principal themes. There are two problems here however in my opinion. One is that the political intrigues occupy a good half if not more of the film, and what we get on the screen is a painfully long succession of bearded gentlemen under top hats arguing and bribing for the good cause. I guess some of the American audiences are more familiar with the historical characters, but even so this is a long and repetitive succession of more of the same, and even the climax scene of the voting in the House misses some of the thrill I have expected. The other problem is the political speak which is attributed to almost all characters in the film. Maybe the script writers used fragments from speeches, I do not know, but there is too much rhetoric, too many historical sentences are being said by many characters (not only by Lincoln) and even in what should have been day-to-day situations. The overall result seemed to me tiring and emphatic. It is actually the non-political secondary threads that seemed more interesting – for example the agonizing decision of the parents Lincoln not allowing their elder son to fight in the war. This dilemma would have deserved a film by itself, a smaller but maybe better one.Much was said and written (even a cover story in TIME Magazine) about Daniel Day-Lewis's impersonation of Lincoln. He is good but far in my opinion from his own creation in 'My Left Foot' or from Joaquin Phoenix's act in 'The Master' (best acting of the year in my view). The way he is filmed does not help, too many frames are looking towards catching his silhouette or making his profile look like the pictures which represent Lincoln in his time. Again, when he is human, when his words are not taken from speeches he looks and sounds better, but this is only for part of the time. Rhetoric prevailed in the building of this role, and Spielberg's scope looks like creating as many scenes to quote, but less to link them in a fluent story as he knows to do that well. I liked much more the supporting roles of Sally Field as a Lincoln's wife, or maybe the wife of all presidents or great men who sacrifice their personal lives for the greater causes, and of Tommy Lee Jones as the radical pro-abolitionist politician Thaddeus Stevens, a man whose life was dedicated to the fight against slavery, but who knows to make the right political move at the critical moment to achieve the legal confirmation of the dream, at a tough personal price with respect to his own ideals. In a movie where so many characters including the one that gives the name of the film are no more than rhetoric symbols, these two living heroes played by the two great actors make a refreshing difference.",6,79,138,3 February 2013
Pi," One of the best underground films
","I try to measure all films by the same scale. I do not care that much if it took 60,000 $ or 60,000,000 $ to make a movie. At the end of the day I will probably pay the same price for the ticket, or DVD rental, and it will take the same 90 minutes of my precious and too short life to see it. What I care about is the emotion, or the intellectual pleasure I took from watching the film. According to this criteria 'Pi' gets an 8 out of 10 on my personal scale. However, one cannot refer to this movie without taking into account that it was made with the lowest budget possible nowadays - a real underground or garage movie if you want. Do not look for smart expensive effects here. Even the computer equipment looks like eightish, although the film was made in 98. The cheap production, the black and white filming gives the whole movie an atmosphere of roughness and sincerity and lets us viewers focus on the story. And the story - well, the story is original and strong. Finding a common mathematics pattern in nature, economy, God has always been the ideal for many geniuses and lunatics. It is hard to say to what category does the main character belong. He gets close to the supreme mathematic or maybe metaphysics truth - at the same time he gets deeper and deeper in what seems to be the darkness of obsession and madness. The films succeeds with that little means to provoke so deep thoughts to the empathic viewer about science, and truth, and madness, and being different, and refusing to plat within the rules of the society. The director, Darren Aronofsky seems to be one of the most original directing voices today. I admire him  for not giving up to the temptations of commercial cinema. If and when he does it, I hope he will not do something like 'Blair Witch Project 2', nor 'Matrix 2/3', but rather keep expressing the strong and original voice he lets us hear in 'Pi'.",8,1,2,4 July 2004
Children of Men," back to the dark future
","None of the visions in science fiction films about what expects us in a few or a few tens of years is too positive. This reflects the global pessimism derived by recent political developments, terrorism, global warming. Director Alfonso Cuar贸n's vision in 'Children of Men' is however by far the darkest that I saw later.'The world collapsed' and the last refuge is Britain, which has become a generalized Iraq combined with a Orwellian vision of a super-patriot and anti-immigration laws. Beyond looking like a huge wasteland the world was struck by infertility, no children were born in the last 18 years. When a woman is pregnant, and when this woman is a black illegal immigrant she becomes the treasure and Mesia of the oppressed, and the object of hunt for rebels and police as well. It is such a coincidence and the killing of his ex-wife that determines the hero played by Clive Owen to get out of his gray carcass of a semi-human semi-robot and start acting as a movie hero.What makes the film remarkable is the skill and consistency of the director vision. We have seen already after all many pictures which described a post atomic era or such. Yet, none of them built that carefully the vision of what our planet could become if we do not pay attention.",8,3,7,10 April 2007
Million Dollar Baby," boring boxing melodrama
","What happened to the critics, what happened to all the fans of this film? What did you guys find interesting in this boring production? How could this film fill in shelves with Oscar prizes - I believe that this says more about the poor state of the film art in US than everything else.It's a rather simple story - Swank is a destiny-hit young woman, working as a waitress and gathering every penny to become a boxing girl. Why - probably just for the seek of the script, we are never told why does she not invest her money in going to college, for example. Clintwood and Freeman are box trainers, quite failed ones, with a common past, and a broken family (Eastwood) finding in Swank's character kind of a surrogate daughter.The first 40 minutes of the film are spent with Swank convincing the two to accept her as a trainee. Then, a few fights, and it's the best part of the film. The last 40 minutes are spent in pure melodrama, and I would say no more, as people will still go and maybe enjoy it - I did not.Acting is reasonable, especially Eastwod and Freeman. Swank is average, her work is far still from Oscar level. The director Eastwood never convinced me, and he is not doing it in this film either. There are good box movies, I remember Zefirelli's 'The Chanp' with Jon Voight - that one was a melodrama too, but here, 25 years later Eastwood has nothing new to say. It just does not ring me any bell, I was simply disappointed by this film.",6,2,4,15 July 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," in the best tradition of American political film
","This is not the first film of George Clooney, 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' preceded it, but this is certainly the first important film. I am no big fan of Clooney the actor, even in this film his own part seems to me one of the weakest links in a very good movie, and I prefer that he focuses on directing. 'Good Night, and Good Luck' shows that he has the talent.The story of the fight between the CBS news team and the political persecution and witch hunt led by right-wing senator McCarthy in the 50s has strong connotation in the actual political scene in America. This is one more reason to applaud the good work done by Clooney, who is shooting the whole movie in black and white and mixes almost perfectly real news footage with the atmosphere in the TV studios of the time recreated with a great care for detail. Jazz music links pleasantly between the scenes and builds the overall tome of the film. Splendidly acted by David Strathairn in the principal role, Downey Jr., and a few other excellent actors, the principal downsize is the lack of more consistent material. It is seldom that I consider a film to be shorter that it should be, but here is one of those cases. Yet concision may be looked as a sign of quality and hopefully, this movie coming directly from the tradition of 'Citizen Kane' will be one of the first steps in a magnificent director career.",8,1,2,13 October 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," pure entertainment - for whoever likes it
","I liked more the original 'Resident Evil'. It was not a masterpiece or a very original film either, but at least the idea was rather new, and seeing Milla Jovovich as the principal action hero fighting armies of zombies created by a scientific experiment gone wrong was refreshing. The problem with 'RE2 - Apocalypse' is that the film turns again around seeing Milla Jovovich as the principal action hero fighting armies of zombies created by a scientific experiment gone wrong, and what was new a couple of years ago looks like a repetition here. Paul Anderson who directed the first film only wrote the script here, leaving the task of directing to somebody else, who could not bring too much life in this second film in what looks will become a long lived series. A sequel must have new elements, keep some surprises to attract the viewers - this is not the case here. Nothing is very wrong, the new cast around Milla is quite OK, but we have seen too many times the same or similar characters in similar situations, and as in many other movies the outcome is just too physical and too expected. So, zombie films and action films fans will get an average product that most of them will probably enjoy because this is what they expected. Fans of good cinema will come out with empty hands. 5 out of 10 on my personal scale.",5,2,4,21 January 2005
Mulholland Drive," Confusing, but Beautiful Movie
","Whoever looks for a good and simple story - this is not a movie for him/her. As many of David Lynch's films, 'Mulholland Dr.' is complex and mixes reality and dream in a sophisticated and beautiful web. I can provide an explanation for the story, with some time twisting, but it would be a useless spoiler. The beauty of the acting and filming, the mistery of the atmosphere, Lynch's themes of passion and horror played back from other movies, the way he plays with the popular culture in an LA we know and re-discover - all these are combined in a movie you need to dip in, and not look for the killing logic. It is the strangest movie I saw lately, and one of the best. 9/10 on my personal scale.",9,1,1,29 March 2003
8 Mile," Not Only for Rap Fans
","I confess to be the age of rap fans parents, and my musical taste is far from rap. However, this is a surprisingly good movie, that makes justice and throws light on the world of the rappers. There is social content, there is artistic logic and truth, it is a strong documentary and emotional film and story. Much was said about the acting of Eminem - what can I add. If one is an artist, you may be multi-faceted, and this may be the case with Eminem. He is good, and may some day make a career by acting other parts than himself. Overall, I liked the movie, and I am surprised! 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,1,2,21 April 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," That's Entertainment
","(I mistakenly posted this comment originally on vol. 2 - it was meant for vol. 1)Take 'Kill Bill' for what it is - good escapetionist entertainment, and you have good chances to enjoy it. Judge it according to art cinema criteria, and you risk to not like it and miss the fun. Terentino may be one of the most talented film makers around, but his violent and beautiful films are not meant to be more than entertainment, and folks looking for big artistic messages are searching in the wrong place.'Kill Bill' is a revenge story, as many were written for the big screen since the beginning of the Western history. There is not too much originality in the story - what is different is the art of film making, the smart mix of quotes from all what Terentino likes in the history of cinema, from spaghetti westerns to classic Japanese samurai films, the soundtrack, and of course the unmistakable touch of non-censored violence so typical to Terentino.Overall, the film is entertaining. I saw it on DVD, and I cannot wait for volume 2 release on DVD, so I intent to see it tomorrow in the theater. 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,0,2,8 May 2004
The Adjustment Bureau," Chairman is another of His names
","The Adjustment Bureau starts like an election year movie. As we are in 2012 this may be the right time for such films, but it quickly quits that path to go into a direction that I personally find even more interesting and attractive that the life and career of a politician who may be ruined because of intrigues or just because he will follow his own personal instincts and chose love even at the risk of his career. We get these all in the film but also much more, as we can expect from a film based on a short story by Philip K. Dick. The world, we learn pretty soon is not completely run according to hazard. Actually there is a plan, a well organized plan and a quite big bureaucratic system with a well-established hierarchy which makes sure everything happens according to the plan and in extreme situations takes measures to adjust the disturbances. One of these happens to our heroes – the candidate senator played by Matt Damon meets accidentally and falls for the beautiful and talented ballerina played by Emily Blunt and they do not forget and search each other despite being separated for years and insist on getting together despite the plans of the great institution that was targeting the hero to become a future president, but a bachelor one for some reasons. In the antic tragedy the name of the institution was Destiny, Christianity and other religions call Him God, in this film his name is Chaiman, and his clerks have all very handy tablets which can be of help to a lot of things including shortcuts by secret backdoors in traffic-jammed Manhattan (sure, I want one, Apple, please!).One does not feel at all that this is a first long feature film for director George Nolfi. However at some point I regretted this not being his second or third film – he has talent in telling a story, skills in directing the actors, if he only had dared going deeper in the direction of the dilemma and confrontation between fate and good will – we would have maybe received an even better movie. But even so The Adjustment Bureay is smart and sensible and better than the average.",7,1,2,7 October 2012
Cold War," love in times of cold war
","Pawel Pawlikowski continues a tradition of remarkable film directors that left their mark in the history of cinema in the second half of the 20th century and made of the Polish film school one of the best in Eastern Europe, competing in value and number of remarkable movies only with the Soviet school of cinema. Andrzej Wajda, Krzysztof Kieslowski, and young Roman Polanski made wonderful films despite Communist censorship, fighting and tricking the censors and using cinema as a mean of social and political protest using the tools of art. 30 years passed since the fall of the Communist regimes in Poland and the rest of Europe, but film makers from that part of the world continue to get back obsessively to those times. They do it now with a different perspective, and free of political constraints. Did time heal the wounds? Maybe, at least in part, but there are lessons to be learned, traumas carried over generations and realities that perpetuate in mentality that invite to thought and debate.'Cold War' (the original title is 'Zimna wojna') tells a non-conventional love story that takes place in troubled times. Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) is a musician and co-founder of a musical institution for talented young people trying to promote authentic Polish folklore - music and dance - in the conditions of increased ideological pressures. Zula (Joanna Kulig) is one of his pupils, a young and beautiful girl, just out of a troubled childhood. Their relationship goes against all the conventions because of age gap, social status, cultural level, puritan rules of morality. Poland is hardly a place were their relationship can blossom .Aspiring for freedom they will cross the Iron Curtain on both directions, but hardly find happiness or accomplishment in the Paris of the 1950s either. The impossibility of their love - is it caused by the hardship of time, or by personal incompatibility? I did not get a clear answer even after the last frame of the film.What I liked. The whole cinematographic concept - black and wide, narrow screen format - fits well the story and makes a reverence also to the cinema of the period when the action takes place. The music is fabulous. It starts with real folklore songs, continues with the processed folklore mixed with the hymns to Stalin which was promoted in the Communist countries at that time, switches to jazz and French chansons for the time spent by the heroes in Paris, and returns to the 'light music' of the early 60s in Poland. Music tells as much about the period as the story itself. The settings and the atmosphere are carefully designed, from the muddy desolated landscape of Poland in 1949, passing through the Berlin of 1952 still bearing the scars of war, the Paris of the 1950s undergoing the Americanized healing, and back to the Poland of the late 50s and 60s, with its own version of the Gulag but also with the false shining of life 'normalized' under Communist control. All these are realistic and credible.What I liked less. Although both Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot are fine actors and their individual performance are good, their relationship does not look at any moment too credible on screen. Hard to tell if their lack of chemistry is intentional or not, but they never seem to fit one with the other, and their love story looks as cold as the war which gives the title to the movie. This surprising lack of vibration lessens the final impression about a movie with many qualities and certainly worth watching.",8,1,3,22 January 2019
Silence," question and answers
","Why is (or was) God silent is a key question for believers. Why was God silent when Christians were prosecuted and died for their religion in the 17th century in Japan? Why was God silent when Jews were prosecuted by the Catholic Inquisition and died for their religion at the very same time? Or when Christians fought and killed each other in the European religious wars in the same century? Or during the Holocaust? Or today when people are prosecuted, fly for their lives and die for their religion in so many parts of the Globe? Is (or was) God silent? Or maybe He did speak and we did not hear Him? Those are the questions asked in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'. Are these questions asked in a generic manner, or just limited to his own faith, and to the specific period he deals with? Are the answers the film gives convincing? The experience may depend on the viewer's close or remote relation to faith. The story of the two Catholic priests who are traveling in AD 1640 in Japan at one of the most cruel periods of persecution of Christians, their encounter with the different culture and religions, their fight to help the devote local Catholics who were continuing to stick to their belief, their own personal fight with the doubts and the apparent silence of the Divinity, their dilemma the ultimate choice that they need to make between saving lives and their own soul, between martyrdom and apostasy - all these may speak a lot to believers in general and Catholics in particular. From that perspective, this is the Via Dolorosa story with a different ending. What if as viewer one does not belong to either of these categories? These viewers are left with a film of exquisite cinematographic beauty but with a slow and unconvincing story telling, quite surprising for a master director as Martin Scorsese is.There is a secondary story here of the relationship between the priest father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and the local fisherman who helps and then betrays the two priests Kichijiro (Yôsuke Kubozuka). It's an extension of the Jesus - Judah story, a continuation maybe of the relation between the two described in Scorsese's 1988 'The Last Temptation of Christ', and one more work that deals with the story of Judah, part of a trend of 'rehabilitation' of the character, at least in films and books. I liked this part, and the acting in general (not to forget Liam Neeson who always fills any screen he is on). I liked less the long off-line monologue which becomes quite repetitive at some point, the 'Deus ex machina' off-screen voice that shows up at a key moment, and the odd epilogue that does not add too much to the story, is told in a different style and from a different perspective. Maybe it's just Scorsese's way of making sure that we place the story he is telling in the historical context? Did he really need this?One of my friends wrote after reading the original version of my short review: 'It is an experience more than a movie to watch.' I agree with her. Seeing 'Silence' is like visiting a church. Christians and non-Christians, believers and non-believers, everybody has a different experience, remarks and appreciates different things.",7,0,0,13 April 2017
The Dark Knight," darker than ever
","'The Dark Knight' is a new and interesting achievement in the career of Christopher Nolan, a director who always tries to do something different, something that surprises and takes films beyond the genres of patterns they are supposed to belong to. Although I do not share the superlatives and I do not think that 'Dark Knight' belongs to the top 10 or even top 100 movies of all times as it is placed now, there are enough interesting things to make it worth seeing.It's dark times out there and our preferred movies sequels get darker also. 'Dark Knight' starts in a routine comics movie style, with a confusing first quarter an hour until we can make sense of the characters and we start understanding that it's more here than the standard stuff. Sure, we do get a great concentration of acting talents, and just having Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman play two supporting (but key) roles says enough. What is however remarkable is that this is a long film, and yet, tension and quality builds in time, and the last half hour is the most interesting of all - not because but despite all the special effects, acrobatics fights and car races. It builds into a destructive and apocalyptic vision, and the frightening thing is that in today's world such a vision is almost credible.Amazingly for a comics movie, at some point in time we start to care about the characters. The evil character in the film is the most interesting as well, and we can only deplore the fact that Heath Ledger did not live to enjoy the success of this film which is due to a large extent to his acting talent. As the film all over, within the limits of the mask and of the convention, this is almost the best we can get.",7,0,2,28 November 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Over-rated and Artificial
","I sincerely do not understand what the buzz about this film is about. Charlie Kaufman's story is based upon the idea of erasing memory and the way it affects relationship and love. For science-fiction fans the idea of memory manipulation is not that original at all. Recently the 'Bounty' series or 'Paycheck' brought it to the big screen, and did it in a more attractive way, leading to good action films. The relationship story in 'Eternal Sunshine...' is rather banal, and even Kaufman could not resist to a quite routine ending. A lot of screen time is spent into simulating the effect of memory erasing, but I found much of it not-inspired and artificial. Jim Carrey is mis-casted, he wears a monkey grimace much of the film that let me ask how he could raise the emotional interest of Kate Winslet. Kate is better than Jim, while Elijah Wood and Kirsten Dunst do good supporting roles. Overall, I did not find the film too interesting, it's just fair entertainment that tries but does not succeed to be something else. I cannot share the enthusiasm of many other viewers about it, and gave it a 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7,1,3,5 November 2004
Avatar," a dimension is still missing
","My impressions after having seen 'Avatar' are mixed.On one hand I am the kind of film viewer who does not run away from entering the film theater and expecting a greater-than-life experience. I also love computer effects and any special effects that extend the cinema experience. From this point of view James Cameron's film is one of the best that I have seen, maybe second only to Peter Jackson's last film in the Lord of the Rings series in creating a whole new world of fascinating beauty, in imagining shapes, colors and visual emotions that did not exist before.I also am a big science fiction fan, I love third degree encounters, and I let easily the small or tall, green or blue aliens move and frighten me. Yet, when judging a science fiction story or film I use the same criteria as when judging any other story or film - the capacity of entertaining, of creating emotion, and of making me think. Here I think 'Avatar' is no more than an average movie. Considered beyond the visuals it is no more than a quite banal action film, with stereotype characters (human or alien), with an anti-colonial message that is routine having seen it in scores of films from the Tarzan and John Wayne movies to the latest Iraq films, and with New Age incantations that never convinced me in any film ever.The 3D genre is not so new. I have actually seen a 3D film festival in a cinematheque a decade ago, and it was made up mainly by action and science fiction films of the 50s. The technology was amazingly similar based on the two colors plastic spectacles. I find it remarkable that film makers took this technique out of the dusty drawers and made it enhance the other new film effects invented since. Films will however be judged by most people by the emotions they generate. My feelings after seeing 'Avatar' are that I viewed a fine visual show, but that it was deprived of originality and depth. Despite the 3D visuals a dimension was still missing.",6,8,17,17 January 2010
The Artist," ... and the rest is NOT silence
","The Artist is a good and entertaining film, and it may deserve the handful of Oscar prizes that it received. I missed it in the theaters, then I bought the DVD when I was in Paris, and it's only now that I got to see it. My conclusion is that it's good, but slightly over-hyped and something is missing for it to be the great film some people talk about.Let me start with what I liked most. It's a film about cinema and specifically about Hollywood and it may be or it may be not surprising that it's been written and directed by a Frenchman and the star is another great French actor. After all it's the French who are the most respectful to the tradition of the great American cinema, and this is not something new, this lasts for more than half a century. While the American themselves criticize and change all the time the face of Hollywood (and it's good that they do it), the French seem to be permanently fascinated by the legends of the American cinema and the silent movies is the one picked to be the subject of The Artist, or better said the death of the silent cinema and the fate of its stars. The story of George Valentine (Jean Dujardin), the star of silent cinema in 1927, who refuses to acknowledge the revolution of the 'talkies' in 1929 and finds himself rejected and abandoned by almost everybody in 1931 is well and simply written and filmed with elegance by director Michel Hazanavicius. Dujardin gets fine replicas from Berenice Bejo as the growing star of the new era and James Cromwell as the faithful driver of the falling star. The two and the cute dog, who would have deserved an Oscar for canine performance if there was one, never abandon the hero, they actually all love him and cause us to love him despite perceived character problem. Eventually even the shark-producer acted by John Goodman will give to George Valentine a second chance in life.So yes - it's a well written story, a respectful reverence to a crucial period in the evolution of cinema and its heroes, an interesting format which makes the story different. Why is it 'good' and not 'great'? It is good because the film could not have been possible in a different formula - the silent film that describes the transition of the world of cinema from silent to talking movies. It is not great because the formula is too obvious in a few places (when the film less creates emotions and more tries to show how smart it is) and because the ending contains a 'deus ex machina' type of solution that goes in the contrary direction than the whole film. But maybe I am wrong. If more great silent films will follow I definitely will prove to be wrong. I would be happy to be wrong in this case.",8,2,4,1 December 2012
La La Land," sorry, not a masterpiece
","The buzz is high, the prizes started to accumulate. They tell however more about the status of the industry and the longing of the public for escapist entertainment combined with a high dose of nostalgia for the musical successes that were running high 60 or 70 years ago. La La Land directed by Damien Chazelle combines a well known formula, makes reverences to the golden period of the musical films in Hollywood (some scenes were filmed in the studio were Fred Astaire once was filmed) but also to some more modern film makers and their ideas (like Ki-duk Kim), and enjoys the participation of shining stars like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. It may be sufficient for collecting statuettes. It is not enough to make it a real good film. I know I am in a minority expressing this opinion now. I believe that it will be a growing minority soon.What we get with La La Land a collection of a few wonderful moments connected by an awfully schematic story. Boy meets girl, of course. Boy is an aspiring jazz musician in a time when real jazz seems to be in a descending slope of interest, Girl is an aspiring actress, waiting in a Starbucks (or like) coffee shop and auditioning in a serial and desperate manner. They both have visions and passion. They both aspire to careers, but life is tough and art and success seldom meet for one person and almost never with personal happiness. Or true love. From here on the story accumulates many of the possible stereotypes and too little artistic truth. Great scenes are not missing - actually this film has a number of memorable quotes, the problem is the rosy sweet materials on between. There is also one great idea that I liked - who does it belong to? script writers or director - the non-reality scenes are drawn in music and dance. The ones from the films in the 40s and 50s.When jazz is played however, it's different. Jazz music is also about being true, great jazzmen do not lie when they play music. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) explaining to Mia (Emma Stone) what jazz is about is one of the best scenes I have ever seen about jazz. The problem is that this is not a jazz movie. As much as I love Ryan Gosling and appreciate Emma Stone their chemistry on screen is not enough to sustain the film, and it actually makes their breaking (and the break away scene) even less credible.Just to be clear - La La Land is not a bad movie. Damien Chazelle is at his third film, the two other were also one way or the other related to music. Whiplash was welcome with ravishing critics and a very high IMDb rating. La La Land however belongs to a very different category. In the thin air of the ideas and good cinema of the last years it will get a lot of prizes in the next couple of months. Many of them are not deserved. I write this by respect for what the film is (and is not) and for what the Academy, BAFTA, or Golden Globe awards should be. I am expecting more and better films about music from Damien Chazelle. Maybe a great jazz movie.",7,4,10,10 January 2017
Saw," a horror film that works
","'Saw' is a horror film that works and this is not small stuff in a genre that was that much loaded recently with pretentious productions, expensive actors, but with no real effect on the screen. I believe that the quality of the film starts with the story which has logic, develops at a good pace and surprises the viewer at any corner from the very beginning to the end. The Australian director James Wan does best with a team of anonymous actors, and leads us through the twists of the story without any visible flaw. The movie has a high amount of ketchup blood and tough scenes even for its genre, but when solid logic stands behind it is perfectly OK for the viewer who comes to expect it.",8,0,1,29 April 2005
Super 8," when J.J. Abrams and Steven Spielberg met
","I sat to watch Super 8 with the expectation of seeing the science-fiction / fantasy film of the year. The director is after all J.J. Abrams, the director of the last Star Trek and the producer of my previous favorite science-fiction series Lost and of my current favorite Fringe. No other than Steven Spielberg is the producer and rumors have that he had quite an active part in this production. And yet I was disappointed.Super 8 has a very spielbergian look, colors and cinematography-like. It is set in 1979, at the same period when Spielberg's great science-fiction films were made. Kids are in the center of the action, and Spielberg likes and knows to make movies and maybe understands better kids than women for example. The first 15-20 minutes when we get to know the heroes are pure fun, as a gang of kids get together to make a film, kind of an homage to the films noirs of the 40s - all is fine as in a good Spielberg film. But, hey, wait a moment, this is a J.J. Abrams film, isn't it? And actually trouble starts exactly when the aliens and the rest of the grown-ups world interfere. I mean trouble for the heroes, but also or merely for the film.Here is the problem of this film as I see it. There are too many Spielberg ideas here, and too little of J.J. Abrams. It looks like the master threw a basket of ideas, many ideas, good ideas, and the apprentice did not really succeed in putting them together in a convincing one story line. There are too many quotes in this film, from Humphrey Bogart passing through the special effects a la 50s and reaching to E.T. Many pieces of magic, a few scenes to remember, but here I am a few weeks after I saw the film and I cannot remember well the story line, which means that it did not really matter. Many people will like the film, and I also liked the passion for cinema and for alien encounters, but the overall impression is of a collection of beautiful scenes wrapped in a conventional and unconvincing story. A miss, maybe a miss to remember, but still a miss.",6,1,2,17 January 2012
The Last Samurai," Too predictable
","Warning - possible spoilers!'The Last Samurai' could have been a great Hollywood movie in the series of films dedicated to the meeting between the Western and Far East civilizations. It does have many of the needed ingredients , and enjoys the participation of two mega-stars of the American and Japanese cinema. For much of the duration of the film, it meets the expectations, especially with respect to the rendition of the atmosphere and in the building of the conflict between the modern world and the old ways of the traditional Japanese culture. Tom Cruise is good as you expect, but does not get to the level of an Oscar performance. The film gets worse in its last part. First it is too long, suffering as many of the Hollywood films lately of the tendency to add the unjustified half hour to our film experience. The historical truth is badly twisted, but this would be no problem if this would buy some real emotions. What happens is that the Hollywood clichees take over any artistic logic - soldiers die in the slow motion we have seen in that many action films, the main hero dies exactly the way you would expect from minute two of the film, and even some dream-like  rosy end is stuck as a final scene without any reason. That's how what could have been one of the great films of Hollywood falls into mediocrity. What a miss! Still a film worth seeing, but only 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7,0,0,10 February 2004
Sinister," for fans of horror to enjoy
","Being scared is not fun for everybody. The horror movies genre has its addicts and fans, but also its haters or people who just avoid watching. I believe that with 'Sinister' directed by Scott Derrickson in 2012 we face one of those cases of a film that spectators who love or at least can live with the genre will like, while people who dislike horror movies would better be advised to skip it.The story in 'Sinister' fits into one of the most used patterns. A family which seems 'normative' by all criteria moves into a new house. It will soon be clear that the family is not that normative (the father makes a living from writing about sordid true crime stories) and that the house is also marked by having been a crime scene in the past. What is different in this film is that the fight between sanity and horror, between the tentative to explain things by logic and the powers of darkness is well described and the gradual fall in fear that happens in almost any good horror film is described in a credible manner. There is logic in what happens on screen, but this is the logic of horror films, and the viewers need to accept the rules in order to enjoy.What I liked. 'Sinister' follows the rules of the horror movies and the script graduates well the slow transition between 'normal' and 'horror'. Ethan Hawke gives a good performance of the writer trying to rationalize what happens to him and to his family and fights the occult with the wrong tools. The use of 16mm film to bring back the crimes of the past is a nice idea, and never has a box with film reels looked so frightening. Much of the film action takes place deep in the night, and the cinematography is adequate.What I liked less. I am always uneasy with kids in horror movies. I guess, however that this is part of the typical scripts in the genre or sub-genre. I also found the other characters and especially the wife (Juliet Rylance) too schematic.Fans of the genre will probably love this film. Most of the other, better chose something else.",7,0,0,3 January 2019
Woman in Gold," the impossible restitution
","Maria Altman, the principal character wonderfully acted by Helen Mirren in 'Woman in Gold' is a Holocaust survivor. At some point in the film she gives a public speech where she traces the origin of the word 'restitution' to a Latin term which means restoration to original condition. Today's Wikipedia further clarifies: 'The general rule, as the principle implies, is that the amount of compensation awarded should put the successful plaintiff in the position he or she would have been had the tortuous action not been committed.' At the top layer of the story 'Woman in Gold' is about the restitution of a work of art, the fabulous 'Portrait of Adele Bloch Bauer', one of the masterpieces of Gustav Klimt and of the Austrian art to the successors of the rightful owners, Jews from whom the work was confiscated and who perished in the Holocaust. Deeper it asks the question whether the true restitution is ever possible. Returning to the original condition of the Jewish life in Europe after the Holocaust? The answer given by the film is a definite 'No'. Restitution of art may be possible. Restitution of the broken human lives is not.The story has many elements of docu-drama and is largely based on a true story of a legal battle held in the last years of the 20th century between a Holocaust survivor from Los Angeles helped by a young and idealistic lawyer and the government of Austria. The combination of the BBC and Hollywood production of the Weinstein studios did not leave too much room for cinematographic invention, and director Simon Curtis did not add too much on this respect. The successive sequences of the legal battle may have been close or remote from the actual truth, but they were not terribly interesting even for the fans of the courtroom movies. The schematic depiction of the Austrians as bureaucratic bad guys, as well as the idealization of the American justice system did not add too much either. The gold in the 'Woman in Gold' lies somewhere else.First, acting of Helen Mirren is superb. She's one of these few actors that leave me lacking words. After each great role that she makes I declare that she is at her peak, and then in the next movie she reaches another higher one. Same here. To say that she deserves an Academy Award for this role seems too pale a compliment. Part of my family comes from that part of the world and has similar origin. She is like one of them.Her role is however more than this. She gives a face to the Holocaust, she makes me understand the human dimension of the tragedy that the generation of my parents went through. That part of the film, the flashbacks that bring back to her mind the memories of the lost happiness, the brutality and vulgarity of the change, the tragedy of leaving the parents back, the determination to survive, the refusal to look back, the decision to end being silent - all these are very well described, and they make of 'Woman in Gold' one of the important movies about the Holocaust.Ryan Reynolds is a miscast. Tatiana Maslany on the other hand is a splendid young Maria. In its good moments and there are many of them 'Woman in Gold' is a 'must see' film.",8,5,8,14 June 2015
The Legend of 1900," Old-fashioned Since the Premiere
","They say that they do not do movies like this any longer. Truth is that they do not watch movies like this any longer either. Many good films were filmed on ships - the closed environment, the romantic setup,the taste of adventure related to sea were good premises for memorable movies from 'Ship of Fools' to 'Titanic'. However, 'Legend of 1900' does not deliver - it is long, melodramatic, and despite many beautiful moments lacks the artistic glue to make of it the big and memorable movie it could be.I was disappointed. This was the most American movie made by an American team after the spaghetti Westerns. It's place is in the archives since the moment it was launched.",7,3,11,27 July 2002
From Hell," Don't Panic, It's Just Hollywood Hell
","I enjoyed the movie, but I think that the opportunity of a great movie was missed. It has logic all over, it is not badly acted, and succeeds to recreate something of the London Victorian atmosphere. A quite sophisticated explanation of the Ripper cases bought me in, and I am sure many will be in my situation. There are some tough scenes, but it is about Jack the Ripper after all. Word is out that the film authors will join the Cohens and the Tavianis in the gallery of great brother directing couples. I think that it is too early to say - there was a big subject our there, but the general outcome is too conventional. Almost each 'surprise' could be anticipated one scene earlier, the red and black cinematography and the sets smelled Hollywood, there is good acting but no unforgettable act.",8,1,2,27 May 2002
National Treasure," good entertainment, one of the best of the year
","For a change, here is an action movie without any comics character, no super-hero, nobody flies or moves buildings with his bare arms, on the contrary, the main character does from time to time something very different ... he thinks! 'National Treasure' is someplace between where 'Indiana Jones' was and where 'Da Vinci Code' will be - treasure hunting mixed with historic riddles, with a considerable dose of free masons and US revolution history. It succeeds to catch us and makes us spend a pleasant two hours because it is well done, nicely acted, brings to screen some of the well known locations in the US North East without destroying them completely, and enough credible things happen in the screen at a good pace to keep our interest alive.Nicolas Cage exchanges his typical anxiety for the obsession of a treasure hunter, and has fun carrying his Donald Trump hairdo for the length of the movie. Diane Kruger is OK as Cage's emotional interest, now that she does not have to carry the responsibility of the Troy war on her shoulders. Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight show up in supporting roles - none of them will run for a Oscar for this, but they certainly have fun and help us having fun.I read that 'National Treasure 2' is in the making - I hope that it will keep the level up and I am pretty sure that I will go to see it.",8,0,1,16 July 2005
Limitless," stretching to the limits
","One of the latest films I saw before 'Limitless' was 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice'. The two share at least one line in which the supernatural capabilities of the hero are explained by his making used of 100% of his brain capabilities, while us, the rest of the mortals scarcely use 10% or 20%. In this movie the explanation is a memory enhancement drug, in the other one magic but is there a difference? Let us not forget that the best film director Neil Burger has on record (better than this one) was 'The Illusionist'. This director probably does believe in magic.What are the effects of the drug on our hero which seems to be doomed to be an eternal loser? They turn him into a super-smart analyzer and winner into the stock market, a heart-breaker speaking all languages immigrant waiters speak, but they also put him in trouble with the Mafia and maybe - we just never know - turn him into a murderer. Bradley Cooper with the help of some special effects that make his eyes more blue than deep sea when under influence does a fairly good job which is not pushed into the corner even by Robert De Niro in another of these roles that do not do too much good to his filmography but may round corners to his bank account.The film does work eventually especially if concerns about morality and credibility are pushed aside. If at some point in time one may suspect that the story will make the case about drugs not really improving life or eventually asking the payback for their effect some disappointment may be in the waiting. Limitless is fair entertainment based on an interesting premises, the kind of movies we remember the idea but not the details soon after we finished the viewing.",6,1,2,7 May 2012
The Red Violin," blood and music
","This ambitious project realized 15 years ago and directed by Francois Girard uses a not completely new pretext for its story line retracing 300 years of history of a superb violin manufactured at the end of the 17th century, a violin born in tragedy and seeming to carry unusual passion and power which marks the destinies of all its successive owners. When watching this film we cross centuries, countries, continents following the destiny of an unusual instrument which seems to be hiding the special gifts making wonderful sounds, but also a curse for the fate of its owners. An object that ignites art and passion.The story telling predicts by a few years the novels of Dan Brown and the like, and we deal in parallel with the chronological told story of the violin and with the intrigues behind the scenes of the public auction in which it is sold at the end of the 20th century. As the story develops we understand that the participants in the bid are also related to the history of the instrument, descendants of its previous owners, connected also through a destiny predicted in cards of tarot, which is also revealed gradually as the story progresses.15 years after the film was made its music and some of its independent story segments survive better than the whole. Violinist Joshua Bell was the musical consultant and probably played much of the score, which makes for some very interesting but out of the beaten track music. I liked it, but do not expect to hear any famous scores, you will need to listen carefully to understand the passion and appreciate the quality. The short stories in the history are all well written but also a little bit conventional, characters are drawn with attention, and love for music. The connection between the episodes is not so well made, the five cards can be a transition trick that works well on TV, but the jumps in time and the changes of hands of the owners are too sketchy for a big screen movie. The final episode (of the public auction) introduces an element of suspense which I found again to be a little too conventional and not really in tune with the rest of the story. A little bit like a musical composition with many beautiful passages but lacking strength in composition and a 'finale' to remember.",6,1,1,21 June 2013
Sicario," the borders of the country of law
","If you really need to put genre tags or labels on movies, 'Sicario' would belong to the 'psychological thriller', 'violent drug action', 'Mexican border' categories. While each of these naming would have its dose of justification, 'Sicario' succeeds to be more than these, actually it is one of the more interesting films in a pre-Oscar Awards season that does not make me too enthusiastic.The film directed by the Quebecois Denis Villeneuve starts and develops for a while on the lines of a violent well-made and fast-paced thriller about American drug enforcement agencies fighting a bloody war against the smuggling Mafia on the two sides of the Mexican-American border. As the story advances we realize that there is much more than a war of gangs going on, and the questions that are asked are not only about the number of victims or arrests, or the amount of drugs that is confiscated or makes its way to the 'customers' but about the balance between law and efficiency, the price of human life and the tragedy of families who are collateral victims of the violence.The quality of the film is built of the combination between the sure hand of the director, the music of Jóhann Jóhannsson and the splendid acting of Benicio Del Toro (in a role that fits him as a glove) and Emily Blunt who grows in the viewer eyes from a don-Quixotesque policewoman one can see only in movies to a key character for the whole story and a real person who carries on her shoulder the huge dilemmas of deciding between good and bad, between the rule of law and the need to win the war on crime by any means.If you like any of the genres I listed at the start, you will not be disappointed by this film. If you are not the fan of any you still can enjoy this powerful drama and professionally made film, which exceeds the borders of the genres.",8,1,2,30 January 2016
Departures," caring for the death, caring for the living
","The Japanese entry that received the Oscar for the best foreign movie deals with a theme that is not unique in the Japanese cinema - the death as a continuation of life, the caring and respect one owes to the dead which helps the living to continue with their own lives. It does it in a manner that is both emotional and serene, and the result is a film that will touch a cord for almost everybody who watches it.The hero is a musician, and this fact plays a role in the film, as it gives a pretext for wonderful music to be inserted and create the appropriate atmosphere or counterpoint in certain moments. He has to quit his profession when the orchestra he was playing in is disbanded and returns to his home city together with his beautiful and seemingly almost smiling wife. By accident - he is misreading a newspaper add - he is hired by an agency that cares for the bodies of the dead before cremation, a work so low class that he cannot even tell his wife about it. It's well paid however and he takes it, and then he is confronted with the reality of the 'departures' - his employer is an artist in the profession of making the final moments of quitting this world honorable for the dead, but especially kind and memorable for the remaining family. And we will all become convinced by the end of the film that this is how it should be.The film certainly belongs to the category of melodrama, but then it is good quality one. Most cinema viewers are not ashamed of dropping a tear when something moves them in the movie and appreciate directors, actors and story writers who are capable to induce such emotions. It tells also a lot to the non-Japanese viewers about conflicts between tradition and new pace of life, and about family relations and the role of the wife in the modern Japanese family. I am not familiar enough with the social and cultural details of Japan to make a judgment to what extent they are authentic, but they are clearly articulated and in a delicate manner. The film is maybe 10 or 20 minutes longer than it should be, but there are no long intervals when it becomes boring, so its length is supportable. It is wonderfully acted and viewers will probably remember for a long while the principal hero played by Masahiro Motoki, the older dead caretaker played by Tsutomu Yamazaki, and the wife Mika, played by the wonderful Ryoko Hirosue. Cinematography is simple and aesthetic, although the scenes of the hero playing music in the nature seem artificial and the filming of the mountain in the background is too many times repeated and apparently unjustified. Over all it is a good and moving film. Maybe it was not the best foreign film of the year, but it was quite a simple and obvious choice for the jury of the Academy.",8,5,6,8 August 2009
Inside Man," good thriller, but was this a Spike Lee film?
","'Inside Man' is a good thriller movie. It has a different idea, and what starts like your usual bank robbery film turns into a more sophisticated action film that you would have expected. You keep asking yourself together with most of the characters what the thieves are after, and they plan to get out of the hostages situation in the mid of Manhattan, and when it happens it all makes sense.It is also well acted. Denzel Washington and Clive Owen are the main players in the cat and mouse game, while Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Cristopher Plummer give strong and key supporting roles.Yet, I may ask, is this a Spike Lee movie? We are always used to Lee making something different or surprising, saying something that makes sense from a social or political point of view. Here he almost plays truthfully the role of conventional thriller director, the fact that the good detective is an Afro-American does not take it for a social comment for a long time, and from this perspective I was a little disappointed.",7,1,2,24 September 2006
Jack Reacher," the producer as superhero
","It's good to be Tom Cruise. Famous, rich, with an impressive list of impressive ex-es, and even gone through a high profile divorce. After having gone through all major role that make a bright career Tom Cruise can afford now to invest and become a producer. He can take a book by Lee Child and make the action film he wants out of it. He can take the role a 6 feet 5 inches hero and tailor himself in it. He can afford beautiful and talented Rosamund Pike as a partner, and Robert Duvall and director Werner Herzog in the the veteran good guy and villain roles. And the result is pretty acceptable.So, who is Jack Reacher? Ex-army investigator, a man hard to discover and trace to the point that some doubt he exists. A man dedicated to finding the truth to the extent that he is ready and willing to sacrifice anything to make justice. A man capable at any moment to fist-fight five tough guys, to put three bullets in the center of the target from any distance, to destroy the heavily arm need of armed bad guys. In other words - a super-hero.No need to tell too much about the story. It's about an apparent clear cut case of mass killing in an American city that proves to be something very different that what you and everybody else in or out the film think excepting Jack Reacher, of course. Viewers get another well done action film, Tom Cruise does his job as an actor as we expect, Duvall and Herzog have fun and so do we as viewers. Christopher McQuarrie is a rather inexperienced director, this was only his second film, but producer and actor and superhero Tom Cruise trusted him with the new film in the 'Mission Impossible' series, so he must have been satisfied. So are we, if we look for good quality action entertainment from Hollywood.",6,0,1,18 April 2015
The Da Vinci Code," Solid but non-imaginative adaptation
","Even Hollywood could have done a little bit more of the huge bestseller by Dan Brown. Despite the hype and the great cast the screen adaptation does not succeed to be as interesting as one would expect. One of the reasons I believe lies in the exaggerated fidelity to the book. As there are too few people who did not read the book, the lack of surprises plays this time much against the movie.On the good side the action is well paced and has logic. On the bad side the two main actors do not really deliver, or even seem to be too interested in the roles. Yes, it is a performance to make Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou look un-interested and un-interesting, but director Ron Howard succeeds to do it, even for the great fan of the two actors that I happen to be. In this case I will probably remember better some of the supporting roles.Nothing or not too much of the mystery of the subject makes it to the screen. I do not believe that the scandal around the book and the movie was justified, this is only popular entertainment and action cinema, and the film never tries to be more. Take it as another big studios action movie, not the best, just an average plus movie of its kind.",6,0,2,4 November 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," disappointing
","The director of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' taking over the Harry Potter series? One would expect some of the humor and good-feeling atmosphere of his previous movies to find somehow place in the teen-Gothic series based on Rowlings nooks. What is happening is quite the contrary and to a somehow a disappointing result.The good things to be said about this fourth installment in the series are about the effects, masterly integrated into the movie, serving well the overall atmosphere and color. I should rather say lack of color, because the world of 'Gobblet of Fire' is much darker and less exuberant than the one in the previous series. The principal characters matured, and the world is much less a universe of childhood masterly taken over by good and bad witches, but starts to look like the threatening world of adults where the destiny of any child is to arrive. Acting is good, the original casting proves itself and the three main actors do not disappoint, but age is doing its work, and we are already in pain believing that the heroes are only 14. Interesting to see how this will be solved in the next series, re-casting may become inevitable.The main problem of 'Gobblet' is the story itself, which fails to interest and lacks continuity. It may be that if we say the previous film one week ago we would remember better what the villains are about and how menacing they really are. It's however two or three years later now, and the result is that we do not really remember why the bad guys are bad, what is Harry's family story, the mature seem too much like a parody, and the terrible things that are supposed to happen on screen look cartoonish and fail to involve the viewer. In the balance between the teenagers angst and the dragons-witch stories it is the teen story that paradoxically looks more interesting, but then, that much money put in a teenage growing story seems to be an excessive expense.",6,0,0,8 April 2006
Three Colors: Blue," a beautiful film about loss and loneliness
","This is one of the masterpieces of Kieslowski. A film that speaks about loneliness, grieving and death, which leaves you with a feeling of premonition, knowing that the director died a few years later leaving so many films undone.This is the story of Julie acted by Juliette Binoche who loses her husband, a famous composer and young daughter in a car accident. After an unsuccessful tentative of suicide she leaves the house where she was living with her family and moves to Paris. In fact she is not sure what to do with her life, she does not know how to cope with the loss, she does not even know if she is capable of feeling anything any longer. While life goes on around her she seems to become kind of a spectator, tries to forget and disconnect from memories in order to alleviate the grieving. Even discovering that her husband had an affair with another woman who is expecting a child from him does not really shake her, although this seems to trigger a process of returning to reality. Will she close the circle? The end seems to say yes - on a factual plan at least - as she is finishing a composition that her husband worked at, and she is restarting a liaison with a friend and long time admirer, but we are not that sure that this also happens on an emotional plan. The last sequence seems to show the principal characters that crossed her path in the movie being each alone in his universe. Real life cannot be lived more than once, loneliness surrounds us in our awaiting for death.Binoche acts beautifully, it's maybe her best role. The pace is slow, the tone is melancholic, but if you like human stories, that make you think and feel this is a movie that you would not miss.",9,0,0,2 March 2007
The Shape of Water," overrated, overrewarded
","From the beginning, maybe even before entering the cinema hall or starting digital viewing, the convention should be understood and accepted. 'The Shape of Water' is a fairy tale, even if it is apparently placed in a reality that has existed 50 or 60 years ago in a well-defined place with somewhat recognizable landmarks in North America. Even the science-fiction pretext is no more than a framework, although much of the action takes place in a science research center filled with fantastic machines with intimidating tubes, and control cabinets with flashes after the last the rage of electronics technologies in the middle of the last century. But it is a fairy tale that is not recommended to children, an adult R-rated fairytale.Director Guillermo del Toro was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1964. His cinematic feature includes 'The Devil's Backbone' (2001) during the Civil War in Spain, 'Pan's Labyrinth' (2006), considered to date his best film , and films from the success of Hollywood's 'Blade' and 'Hellboy.' Two are the common features of his films, which we also find in the 'The Shape of Water'. The first is the presence of monsters in an universe that does not have the same aesthetic rules with our universe all the time, and where what we find to be physical deformation does not, according to ordinary conventions, equate to moral or character. Some of his films, including him most recent ones, have as main theme the meeting people and monsters, and the possible connection between them, a theme inherited from Gothic literature and traditional fairy tales such as 'The Beauty and the Beast' taken over by folk culture in movies and musicals. The second feature is the predilection for different and disadvantaged characters. Elisa Esposito's main 'The Shape of Water' heroine is mute, her friends and partners in the story are a gay painter and an African-American colleague working hard alongside Elisa as a cleaning woman in a government institution. Their opposite, government agent Rachard Strickland is white, rich, racist, and sadistic - all vices embodied in one person, who also has a seemingly exemplary family life and a predilection for expensive cars. A stereotype you would say, but in the end, it's just a negative character in a fairy tale, is not it?The main theme of the film is the possibility of love between species. The 'monster' is brought into a sealed container, is prisoner and the subject of cruel medical experiments, with the shape of a reptilian nightmare, captured somewhere in the jungles and swamps of South America. The cognitive curiosity of the 'monster' is due to its ability to adapt to water and (for a certain period of time) and air. The two parallel respiratory systems could be useful to the Americans but also to their Soviet competitors engaged in the race to conquer the cosmos. This is the end of the scientific pretext of the film, and there is no need for more. Between the two possible approaches, the incompatibility of humans and other species developed in series of movies such as 'Alien' started by Ridley Scott in 1979 and the possible friendship (and even more) with which ET 'Steven Spielberg responded in 1982, Guillermo del Toro clearly chooses the second option. He chooses and develops it because the connection between Elisa - fragile, weird, different in our world - and the monster who also likes hard-boiled eggs and jazz music evolves towards an impossible love affair with explicit erotic scenes, including a scene of inter-species sex with which spectators are aesthetically and emotionally tested.Water plays an essential role in the visual universe created by Guillermo del Toro in this film. It represents the species barrier but also the environment in which the love story is consumed. It's a vehicle for comic sequences and the hero's rescue line. Cinematography and decors with their retro-quality and atmospheric atmosphere create a special aesthetic experience, from this point of view, 'The Shape of Water' stands at the same level as films such as Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo' or 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' by Wes Anderson . I add to this the special acting of Sally Hawkins, an English actress underestimated so far, perhaps because she is not a standard beauty, her physique being better suited for comic or compositional roles. Here, however, she's a perfect fit to a role that she performs with sensitivity and ingenuity, giving credibility to the fantastic relationship between the character of Elisa and the 'monster'.'The Shape of Water' is not a masterpiece. Fairy tales, even those for adults, have their limits. The 'monster' is pretty schematic, and as convincing is Elisa's Sally Hawkins, so little believable seems her attraction to the representative of the amphibian species. Concentration of politically-incorrect vices in the negative character makes it a boxing sack hard to accept, even for a negative character in a fairy tale. The message 'We are new monsters' seems a little rhetorical. This film wining the supreme Academy Award tells more about the state of the industry than about the film itself. But did not we say the same thing in the previous few years?",6,4,20,10 March 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Unfinished Business
","'Matrix Reloaded' is the first part of a two series sequel to the original 'Matrix' (which was one of my favorites - a 10/10 which I rarely give). It not only ends with the magic and promising 'To Be Continued', but it also leaves many of the characters as well as the action suspended in waiting for the final. However, it does take a full ticket price to see it, it's a business after all, and a rewarding one it seems. Thus, the comments are also for the full price we pay and in my opinion, it is an unfinished business. 7/10 on my personal scale, largely a disappointment relative to the original.The Big thing in 'Reloaded' are the effects. Though it does not provide anything similar with the genius vision of the Matrix of humans connected to provide energy for the machines - one of the greatest visual images of the seventh art from the original - it has a huge amount of special effects of memorable creativity and force.  Nothing really new concerning the Matrix. After the positive shock of the original idea, it looks like the authors have not much new to say, and the action is not much better than classical science fiction - humanity fighting machines or aliens - it really does not matter. It's good stuff, but not genial as expected (sorry guys, you are the ones who created the great expectations). Worse, a lot of pseudo-religious, pseudo-Shakespeare talk makes the film too heavy, and even sometimes boring. Overall, good entertainment, but not much more. Let us wait for the third film, and expect that we will be rewarded. I am ready to apologize to the 'Matrix'.",7,3,6,2 June 2003
The Disaster Artist," worst is good
","Hollywood loves more than anything else to make films about Hollywood. There may be some trivial economic reasons for this, films about films taking place mostly in film studios are easy to make in film studios. There is a more deeper reason however, and this is the Hollywood fascination for movies and for itself. It may be considered self-serving, but when the fascination is shared by audiences the result is good movies. Actually, some of the best movies made at Hollywood take place and are about making films (in most cases in Hollywood). James Franco's 'The Disaster Artist' belongs to this category, but there is an increased risk as its topic is the making of 'The Room' considered by many the worst film in history and its principal hero is its director, producer, script actor and lead actor, Tommy Wiseau.'The Disaster Artist' tells the true story of the making of a film which many consider so bad that it should never have been done. Yet, this film is born of the passion and of the desire to prove themselves of two aspiring actors who were rejected by the Hollywood system. We know that Hollywood is a capitalist jungle, that one in a hundred or a thousand make it, that in order to succeed one needs talent and luck. But if talent and luck are missing, can money replace them? Tommy Wiseau tried to prove it by making 'The Room'. The result was surprising, just because the film was not mediocre, it was awful. Superlatively awful, to the point to become a success and a legend.Viewing 'The Disaster Artist' asks some troubling questions about what is a 'good' film, and what it takes for a film to become a 'cult film'. Are we living in times of such confusion of values that nothing does really matter? If bad is good, than 'The Room' is the best because it was the worst? What turned it into a 'cult film' and what does this mean? I would not say that all these artistic and philosophical questions found answers in 'The Disaster Artist'. The film is well made and it entertains, James Franco does a good job as a film director and as an actor, but I cannot claim that I understand his character (yes, he has passion, but passion is just one component of film or any other art making) or what a 'cult film' is. I can however say that I witnessed an episode of the 'cult of 'The Room'' as the cinema hall at the cinematheque in my city was more populated than in an average evening, most of the spectators were young people who knew and voiced text loudly, in chorus and in sync with the actors, and brought with them spoons. Why spoons? You need to come and see the movie to learn the answer.",8,0,3,29 January 2018
The Fountain," unbelievable - is this from the same Darren Aronofsky?
","I cannot believe that the gifted, original, strong, promising director who made 'Pi' and Requiem for a Dream' could make this confusing fantasy. After six years of directorial silence Darren Aronofsky is back with a combination of a New Age transcendental story and a Love Story (yes, that one) melodrama of a scientist confronted with the death of his dearest one. A script full of coincidences does not honor the career of Darren Aronofsky as a script writer either. The parallel lives story combines with mystic accents and worst of all, is filmed in a rosy video clip style with effects which seem to have been designed ten years before the last 'Star Wars' movies. Fair acting in the two principal roles cannot save the show. This was a real disappointment for me from a director I was expecting much more and who I still hope can do better in the future.",3,2,6,28 June 2008
Mystic River," strong drama, solid directing, superb acting, dubious moral ending
","I confess to my sins - I never trusted Clint Eastwood as a director, and I avoided seeing his films - as actor and especially as director since I saw the spaghetti Westerns in my childhood. I may have missed this good film, and stayed in my mind with the stereotype of a bad director, if somehow I did not start seeing the DVD before realizing it was directed by him. I was wrong! Despite his bang-bang youth Eastwood is a solid director. 'Mystic River' is a well filmed drama, he knows to create a full world of emotions, classic in its approach of human relations and honor codes. He lets the superb cast to do its acting, and what an act it is! Sean Penn uses this role to climb one more step to the peaks of American film acting, to these altitudes where Nicholson and De Niro are waiting for him. Tim Robbins abandons for a while politics, and proves he can be a great actor and take upon complex roles without the need of a manifesto film. Kevin Bacon completes the trio in a solid and convincing manner. If there is a problem with this film, it lies in my opinion in its ending. The plot is complex, and the characters run convincingly each towards his or her fate, tragic for most. However, the last two or three scenes seem to have been added as some moral forgiveness comment of the directors. Trying to wipe out all the murder, abduction, child molesting and other traumatic events that have happened before in these final scenes is not convincing. It's actually the first time when what we see on the screen does not fully make sense. Otherwise - one of the best crime and friendship dramas lately. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",8,0,1,25 September 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Superb Acting by Russell Crowe
","This film is certainly memorable for one reason - but one BIG REASON - the superb acting of Russell Crowe. He deserves three Oscars, not only one for his great part. The movie overall is too long, and too conventional for my taste. At no point do we get really the genius at work, and though the schizophrenic non-reality may be well emulated we have a hard time relating the characters into the social reality of their time. However, Crowe is present in almost every shot, and I have not seen such a treat since Dustin Hoffman's Oscar performances. I am now convinced that he is the best actor of his generation.",8,0,2,10 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The 'Chamber' Is Nice, But No Big Secrets Inside
","The second in the Harry Potter series was described as better than the first. I do not really agree with this. The 'Chamber' is a good movie, but there is no really anything new and the magic of the first film is already too well known and repeated here to be efficient. The only new funny character is the computerized servant, which I really expect to develop in the next series. Otherwise, the film is well done, well acted but too much the same. I really wonder if the young ones who are supposed to be a big percentage of the public can really enjoy the movie - some parts are too scary, and the 161 minutes are a challenge for young ages.
However, do not miss it. This is certainly one series to follow, and hopefully the next one will have some more original stuff. 8/10 on my personal scale.",8,0,0,5 December 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," make better use of your money and time
","Unless you are a big fan of Brad Pitt and/or Angelina Jolie and you never miss a film of theirs avoid this movie. I was not expecting some cinema masterpiece, just a relaxing summer entertainment movie, romantic, comedy, or action, I would have taken any of the three or any combination of the three. What I got is a film based almost exclusively on the two stars. They actually deliver, these are not the best roles of their lives or careers, they are still fairly acceptable. However the premises around are so weak, the lack of logic is so dominant, the lack of humor so overwhelming, and the action scenes so devoid of any originality that the overall product is almost a sleeper. Yes, here is a film with two sexy mega-stars, full of car races, action scenes, half a city plus a suburb home are being destroyed, and yet, I almost fell asleep. In one word - avoid!",4,3,7,29 June 2005
The Departed," Scorsese back in gangsters movies genre
","The return of Martin Scorsese in the gangsters movies genre is certainly a spectacle to watch. It takes a Scorsese to gather such a crowd of stars and herd them into a consistent and coherent film like this.The story inspired by a Hong Kong movie is about two policemen belonging to the same generation in the police academy becoming each of them a mole - one for the police with the Mafia, the other within the Mafia for the police. They do not know the identity of each other and their mirrored cat and mouse game is at the core of the story.Matt Damon and DiCaprio play the two main roles, and the mirroring of their fate reflects also in the acting, while sharing the fears of not being discovered and - how not - sharing also the love of the same woman. Although the credibility stack is raised very high in the movie Scorsese succeeds to make it interesting and slaloms well through what could have become a too heavy epic. As a viewer I hold my breath towards the final scenes filled with violence and leaving a number of corpses that rivals with a Shakespearean tragedy.Jack Nicholson creates another of his memorable demonic characters in the role of the chief gangster who manipulates a mole in the police, while fighting to discover the one in his own ranks. It comes as a surprise that the shrewd and mean characters eventually dies at the hands of the unexpected character, but if you look well this is a story where everybody seems to be killed by the wrong man.It is said that Scorsese and Eastwood are front-runners for the best movie and best director Oscars this year. Their two films are two different types of American epics, two poles of the American saga told in their specific ways and styles. 'The Aviator', the previous epic of Scorsese had similar ambitions but failed. Frankly I like that one less. This time, back in a territory that seems familiar, he may have a good chance again.",8,1,2,10 February 2007
The Holiday," good film for a wedding anniversary
","I am not a great fan of romantic comedies which I can stand only in small doses at large intervals in time, but 'The Holiday' plus half of bottle of champagne from yesterday's party was the best film viewing for the occasion. I should add that it's not a bad movie as you can believe reading some of the critics, succeeding to raise above the usual kitsch level of the films in the genre.The two main protagonists of the story are a Californian trailer producer (Cameron Diaz) and a British journalist (Kate WInslet) who on holidays eve are abandoned by their years long love interests who happened both to be absolute jerks and in order to run from depression and solitude enter a home swap, exchanging residences for the period of the holidays. In a very convenient manner a few screen minutes after landing at each others home salvation knocks at their doors incarnated by the comic super-genius Jack Black and by British beau-of-the-day Jude Law. What follows is what you suspect it follows but surprisingly the parallel story develop in quite a cursive manner, dialogs are most of them funny, though they do not avoid completely being too wordy, and the four acting stars seem to have a good time. A special mention is to be made to the character of the old Hollywood script-writer, aced with emotion and nostalgia by Eli Wallach in a deep reverence to the good old American movies industry.Good entertainment for Christmas, wedding anniversaries and maybe in other occasions too.",7,1,3,13 July 2008
Zero Dark Thirty," soulless
","What is surprising for this two and a half hours film depicting the search after Bin Laden, the planning and the execution of the action that killed him is how superficial it is in its approach. It may be that the level of expectations was set too high by the previous film by Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar decorated The Hurt Locker one of the best if not the best film made up to now about the war in Iraq, about the men in uniform involved in it, about the moral and human impact of the war on the people who carry it. Zero Dark Thirty is a very well made film which also proves that making very well a film is not enough for the result to be a piece of great cinema.The film follows a decade of mostly covered activity carried by the CIA in tracing Bin Laden and punishing him. The film tells the story of the searches, with the ups and down, the false tracks, the mistakes, the labyrinths of lies and the misunderstandings caused by the cultural differences. Good action, well told, well filmed. It is just that we are expecting to see something else - because it is a film by Bigelow, because in a film about tracing and punishing Bin Laden we should learn something that we do not know from the stories in the press about tracing and punishing Bin Laden.It may be that the intention of the director was to provide the human interest by pointing to the character of the principal hero - the determined and fearless CIA agent played by Jessica Chastain. Too little, too schematic, I am afraid. Who is agent Maya? What makes her so obsessed with her mission? Where did she learn to fight and win her way in a world and a profession of males? There are a few moments where we are hinted to moral questions about the methods of interrogation, or when the agent mask trembles for a moment leaving room to human feelings, but none of these elements of 'softness' are pursued. All we are left is a character that despite spending two and a half hours on the big screen in front of us and despite good acting does not let us know more about her soul than a routine TV detective hero. Oh, yes - and the memory of a scene of confrontation with James Gandolfini (in the role of the Director of the CIA) little time before the great good-bye of the actor.Much less than expected.",6,0,1,13 September 2013
Steve Jobs," Jobs as father
","The second film in the mini-festival of Steve Jobs movies that I enjoyed last Friday was also the better one. Danny Boyle, the director of Trainspotting, Sunshine, and Slumdog Millionaire may have hit gold again, as his Steve Jobs started to collect awards at the Golden Globe ceremony last night, and Michael Fassbender became lead contender to the magic statuette to be awarded for Best Actor on February 28. What is the secret? The film based on a script by Aaron Sorkin (who also brought to screen the character of Facebook's Zuckerberg) is very different from the other biopic ('Jobs') or from the documentaries dedicated to the man and the entrepreneur who was Jobs. It catches three half-hours prior to three major announcements in the career of Jobs, but does not deal almost at all with the technicalities - they deal with the atmosphere (ordered chaos we can call it), with the encounters of Jobs with people who are close to him - his technical partner Wozniak, his business partner John Sculley, and especially his estrange wife and his daughter, whom initially he refused to recognize in one of these attitudes who built his negative perception as a father and human in the eyes of the public. The situations repeat and escalate, but the relationship with his daughter provide the missing human dimension. We may not understand more of the hi-tech genius of Jobs, but we gain more understanding about the man and father he was.Besides the smart script, acting is the second winning card that makes 'Steve Jobs' the better Jobs film. Michael Fassbender avoids replicating the physical characteristics of Steve Jobs and focuses on his personal life and the relations with his partners and close ones (as close as he let them be). Kate Winslet builds the character of Joanna Hoffman who was the right-hand of Jobs but gets a much more extended role than she played in reality. You may not recognize her at first sight, as this role is pretty far from her usual gallery. A Globe is hers already, other awards may follow.By focusing on a specific segment of Jobs' personality this movie succeeded to give a better view of the whole. Yet, it's only one facet of a huge personality that remains from many other points of view an enigma, and maybe character for more movies.",8,0,2,11 January 2016
War of the Worlds," wining the war
","I do not believe that it took me four days since the movie was distributed here to get an see it. But as they say, better later than never :-) This is not the best, but certainly not the worst movie of Spielberg's. I would say it's well above average. It's interesting to see the evolution of the alien's image in Spielberg's movies - from the smart folks playing mind games with humanity in 'Encounter', via the sweet and children-friendly E.T. - and now we have these pure monsters, no doubt aiming to destroy mankind.Despite opening and ending with the H.G. Wells opening and ending quotes from the book, 'War of the Worlds' is more a horror movie than a science fiction one. Sure, there are a lot of very well done effects, the aliens when we see them close look a little bit like HR Giger's aliens, but the focus is on the small family cell running in terror for their lives. Here Spielberg is closer to Hitchcock then to Spielberg.Best thing Spielberg achieved in the movie is, I believe, the opportunity he gives Tom Cruise to play what I consider simply the best role of his career. He is human, terrorized, far from a super-hero, that's why he is the best. Dakota Fanning is terrific as well, I just wish and pray that her teen years and maturity period will be blessed with roles and acting as good as here. Tim Robbins is good in a supporting role, but I fail to understand where and how he disappears from the screen. Actually the last fifteen minutes of the film are the weakest, a little bit too conventional and expected, although it's hard to see how the tension built until then could have been continued up to the end.One more word of caution - there are a lot of tough and graphically violent scenes, I cannot understand how the rating in the US is only a PG-13. I would not take my young ones to this film, especially girls or even boys if I know they are easily impressionable.",8,1,3,11 July 2005
Love Actually," good, actually
","Here is a rare bird in my cinema landscape. I really am no great fan of good-feeling movies or romantic comedies, but this Christmas film really succeeded to make me feel good, and romantic. Sure, Richard Curtis is one of the best directors in this genre, certainly the best British one, but it takes a pound of courage to engage in such a deprecated genre and a bunch of talent to get out with a cued piece of work like this one.Multiple stories movies are often brought to screen in the last few years. To be successful you need not only for each story to be simple and credible, but you also need a script that gives enough individuality and weight for each of the segments, and a good director that brings everything to look like one piece of work, more like a good composer combines different orchestra sections in a symphony. Al these are present here, and moreover, a brilliant cast, including half of the who's who list of romantic comedy actors, and still allowing a few of them to do memorable creations, especially Bill Nighty in the aged rock star role. Hugh Grant is the only one who seems slightly mis-cast, and this is not because he is not a good romantic actor, but because he looks too young and unsure for a British Prime Minister to be believed.'Love actually' will be on the holidays seasons TV schedules for many years, and for a change will be the one movie on the list that will not cause me switch channels.",8,0,2,7 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," Faust without Satan
","I have somehow avoided seeing There Will Be Blood for ten years despite its success, and despite having as lead actor Daniel Day-Lewis who got his second Academy Award for this role. The reason is that I was under the impression that this is one of those Big American Sagas which make great impression at the Oscars but seldom have convinced me to jump on their ship of emotions. This is true to some extent, as the film deals with the period of the beginning of oil drilling in the United States, the very important difference being that this saga has not an American Hero but and American Anti-Hero as main character. Which probably makes the film even more interesting.The story takes starts before the turn of the 19th to the 20th century and ends in the late 1920s, following the raising of an oil magnate from his first discovery of one oil pit to his taking over a small empire of oil fields and the building of the pipes that ensure the transportation. Daniel Plainview, the character played by Day-Lewis seems to come from nowhere and grows from being nothing to the status of a millionaire. Achieving this takes not only luck and a complete lack of any scruples in dealing with competitors, friends or his very close ones - it also takes his soul. The story is kind of Faustian, it's just that Satan never shows up, or maybe he is there during the whole story under the form of the black gold. The script is loosely based on a novel by Upton Sinclair, with the difference that while in the Socialist writer novel the emphasis is on the social aspects with a critical view of the Capitalist system, in this adaptation it's the moral aspects that prevail, with Planview's character finding a counterpart and nemesis in preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). It's the material world faced with the possible spiritual salvation, another Faustian theme if you wish, but the preacher character eventually proves to be as corrupt and empty in substance as its arch-rival, which makes it unable to fulfill its goal. The destinies of the two are interleaved and they both end in damnation. Director Paul Thomas Anderson opens here a theme which he will continue in his next great picture The Master which offered Philip Seymour Hoffman the opportunity of incarnating one of his last greatest roles.At the end of the day, telling the story of an American hero or of an American anti-hero does not look that different. It is still one of these sagas starting in the days of the rush for gold and ending when the rush for the black gold - the oil - stabilizes into the big corporations consolidations. The lead hero does not seem to have real roots in history or a specific place, and he needs none as most of the attention is focused on its deeds, mostly evil, with the exception of the personal survival story that is being told in the first 15 minutes. As any saga that respects itself it's long, which in cinema today means more that two and a half hours, which according to tastes and attention pass more or less easy. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is superb, he fills the screen with his personality to the point that the balance between his character and the one played by Paul Dano is broken in his favor. Dano acts well but he just cannot raise to the height and intensity of Day-Lewis. There Will Be Blood is one of those movies which cannot be really placed in a specific box, or in more than one - they just build to themselves a category and a name of their own.",8,0,2,26 March 2017
Joker," a dark Joker
","Todd Phillips' 'Joker' surprised me. It was something completely different than what I expected from watching the trailers and reading the reviews written by those who saw the film before me. Apparently the film would belong to a genre that I would call extensions of superhero stories and specifically to the prequels sub-genre revealing the origins of some of the characters in these imaginary worlds, tracing the personalities and motivations of their actions before the first printed comic book or the first movie they appear in. The script of this film goes much further and dares much more. 'Joker' not only redesigns the map and image of the mega-city of Gotha, but also anchors it in a dark and violent world that painfully reminds us of our world and the contemporary events around us. The Joker character created by Joaquin Phoenix is a victim who becomes a vicious criminal, and the film is a study of a vicious mind and a journey to the roots of his violent revolt.The clown is one of the most versatile characters in the history of cinema. From Charlie Chaplin to the horror films written or inspired by Stephen King, clowns have represented the full range of human feelings, from sadness to happiness, from naivety to cruelty, from art to madness. The character created by Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix has all these plus he has something new to add. The aspiring stand-up actor who earns his living as a clown for rent is not only a persecuted and a marginal individual, a victim who rebels (it happened also to Charlot when he was getting upset) but becomes unwittingly a symbol of a collective revolt. Because of his bipolar personality, from a certain moment he does not discern between good and evil, just as we as spectators no longer discern between reality and what happens in his imagination. But his violence in the film is not only accepted but also taken as a role model by one half of the world rebelling against the order and inequality imposed by the other half of the world. I do not think that the film justifies violence in any way, but it does not hide it and it makes us ask questions about its sources.I don't know if Joaquin Phoenix will get the Academy Award for his role in 'Joker'. Maybe for some political reasons he will not be voted by a majority, or maybe an even more impressing role will show up. I think however that this fantastic role will become a reference and will be studied in acting schools many decades from now. I do not remember seeing such a complex study of a disoriented personality, of a victim becoming a murderer, of the personal downward spiral to hell in parallel with the social ascension in the eyes of some people around. Robert De Niro also has a remarkable supporting role, which makes us forget the actor's personality to bring to mind the image of the legendary TV anchors of the past. The city of Gotham seems different from the one in the Batman films, it is rather a New York from the early '80s, full of violent revolts similar to those we are experiencing in the present times. The film is grim and violent, interesting and ambiguous, melodrama and social criticism woven on a story where comic book heroes are just a pretext. My only reservation is related to the final scene, I found it superfluous and little related to the rest, maybe containing a symbolism that I confess I did not understand. Conclusion - 'Joker' is almost a masterpiece.",9,1,5,15 October 2019
Man on Fire," well directed and acted, but long and with a problematic theme
","The theme in 'Man on Fire' is problematic relative to the way the movie is being done. Denzel Washington is a tough character with anti-terror background, hired as body-guard to a rich family in order to guard their child daughter. When the worst fear of the parents become true, he swears vengeance to everybody involved, and engages in a killing spree worth a Bronson and Stallone film. The problem is that in those films you know what you buy, and you seldom question the reasons of the violent action. 'Man on Fire' starts differently, it shows a character with sensitivity and morals very well acted by Washington, and the course of violent action he is taking fits bad in the story. It is exactly the moral dimension of the Bible-reading ex-Marine that makes less believable his immediate recourse to weapons and torture against his enemies. Otherwise I liked the way the film was done, some of the cinema and subtitle techniques are interesting and well combined. The cast is good and well directed, with Dakota Fanning superb in the child role, Mark Anthony , Christopher Walken, and Rachel Ticotin catching good supporting roles.The film is a little bit too long, with the last half hour section looking like being added later, in a twist that starts after one may think everything is over - but it is well justified after all, now that I am thinking back. A good film overall, worth watching, although not without some problems or weaker sides. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7,5,12,18 September 2004
Edge of Tomorrow," not just action
","A lot of film fans deplore or criticize Tom Cruise's latest choice of roles. They all seem to be focusing on action movies, with the 55 (!) years old actor cast in roles where the ration between fights, high-speed chases and use of advance weaponry on one side and meaningful story and dialogues on the other is dangerously unbalanced in the favor of the first. His role in the 2014 'Edge of Tomorrow' apparently falls in the same category. However, the film directed by Doug Liman is much more than this. It is actually one of the smartest science-fiction films in the last few years.Time looping is one of the most intriguing themes in science fiction, and has a huge number of variation and derived paradoxes. The authors of the script of this film have taken the idea and introduced it into a 'War of the Worlds' kind of film and actually cinematography and even the evil alien's appearances look quite similar to the one in the films inspired by H. G. Wells classic novel. What is different is that the superiority of the alien race is not based only on physical abilities but on the capability of controlling and resetting time. Luckily, at least some of the humans will be contaminated and use the trick to fight the invasion. I will stop here in order to avoid spoiling too much, with the promise that there are many more surprises, and that the solution and ending combines action and fine sci-fi.Tom Cruise does what he best does (and likes it) in the last decade, with Emily Blunt a good and fit companion to his deeds. Well-paced action combines with smart writing for a film that needs no excuses to be liked.",7,0,0,15 August 2017
Downfall," best docu-drama in years
","I got to see 'Der Untergang' only now, on DVD, but maybe this is the right format for it. The film is a docu-drama, with all the goo things and the limitations of the genre, and as a docu-drama is better to be seen on the small screen than in a theater.And it is one of the best docu-dramas I saw in years, maybe the best. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel brings to screen the last days of the Nazi regime and of its leaders, crowded in a bunker with a seemingly infinite Web of corridors, terrorized by the louder and louder noises of the approaching Red Army attacks and living the last phantasms of the nightmare their sick minds created, the nightmare that swallowed the whole world.A lot was written and said about Bruno Granz's rendition of Hitler. There is no Oscar for no-English speaking actors, and it's a good thing, because Granz deserves not a Oscar but a Nobel prize for acting, if such thing existed. Hitler's madness exceeded the limits of human understanding, it was madness at history level. Was Hitler a man, or the incarnation of Devil in man's skin? His success in turning his nation into a Evil Empire and half of the world in hell was the result of a mix of historic context, but also the result of a magnetic personality, that Granz analyzes and recomposes with art. Granz's Hitler is a master in human manipulation, the majority of his foes stay devoted to him until the last moment. Granz's Hitler is charismatic, physically sick and mentally mad, he lives in a world that mixes messianic faith with murderous hate for his enemies and especially against the Jews, a world fill of phantasms and military fantasies. He is completely isolated from reality, as all dictators, because dictators inspire fear, fear inspires lies, and you cannot build strategies on lies.Almost all acting is superb. The Nazi leaders, one more sinister than the other are brought to life with art. Julianne Kohler's Eva Braune is a frivole, living the day in the shade of the Great Leader. The Goebbels pair played by Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch are sick and fanatic, they commit the absolute family crime by killing their children before taking their own lives, and killing with them the myths of the German Nazi family. There is some controversy abut the image of Albert Speer, the Nazi minister of economy and the architect of what would have been the capital of the 1000 years Reich, the film presents him in a more human light, but life and history was also more understanding with him, making him the only Nazi leader who ended his life in his own bed.A few words about the character of Traudl Junge, Hitler's young secretary acted by Alexandra Maria Lara. The movie presents her as completely fallen under Hitler and Eva Braun magnetic powers, she is genuinely devastated not by the end of the war but by the personal loss and death of his masters. Only when she gets out of the bunker and sees the smoking ruins of what became of Germany she starts to understand the dimension of the tragedy brought by her superiors to her country and to the whole world. However, the total understanding may have come later, and we understand it when the real Traudl Junge, at his old age tells us, looking into the eyes of the camera 'I should have known!'.Docu-drama has limits, the purpose and quality lies more in the accurate rendition of the history than in looking for the deeper truth. Still, for whoever sees this film, the last days of Hitler will remain as they are described here. There is no one movie that can encompass all the lessons of history, but this movie made from the German perspective provides a veridical and true version of the human dimension of the absolute horror.",9,5,7,31 December 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese did it again
","'Inspired by a true story' seems indeed to be the mantra for the majority of the films in the Academy Awards race this year. A few days ago I saw 'Dallas Buyers Club' and now this 'Wolf of Wall Street' which together with 'American Hustle' are among the strongest competitors in the race and are all inspired by biographies and true stories that took place in the last few decades of the previous century. Even '12 Years a Slave' is inspired by a true story and biography but from the previous century. While I liked much less 'Dallas' I feel 'The Wolf' is quite comparable - both are remarkable movies, both throw light on some dirty and corrupt aspects of the American society, both bring to stage characters which use and trick the system at the same time. While 'Hustle' has a more original idea, 'The Wolf' has Scorsese and DiCaprio.The real life Jordan Belford is probably a much less likable character than the one brought to screen by Leo. He made his fortune in the 80s and early 90s by pulling the strings and walking the dark alleys of a system which was building financial castles on sand and where the real money was made almost exclusively by people like him. The whole movie can be actually considered as a sharp critical view of a society that creates and makes heroes of such individuals. This is however a moral judgment and it belongs exclusively to the viewers - actually the film makers were quite insistent that the many scenes of debauchery in the film were as close to what really took place in Belford's corrupt empire and faithful to episodes from his auto-biographical book. Scorsese can use the excuse that he just makes a film which is fun, interesting, entertaining based on the real life story and the conclusions are yours, Mrs. or Mr. Viewer.It's rather amazing for me that things that I really dislike in other movies work so well under the hand of Scorsese. The use of the out-screen voice for example which I typically hate works here pretty well, as it gives an auto-biography touch to the whole story. I would hardly bear three hours in a cinema theater if it was not a very well told story, with heroes and action that keep me quiet in the chair. Leonardo DiCaprio amazes me again and again, especially when Scorsese directs him. His hero is mean and cynical and does abhorrent things and yet he is simply fascinating. The most questionable thing in the film seemed to the ending, which I frankly did not understand. Maybe it tried to make a point that I missed, maybe it just described the anti-climatic years of the rest of the life of an individual past his wild years - I do not know. It came however too late to spoil my immense appreciation for this film.",9,1,4,24 February 2014
The Last King of Scotland," the superb performance by Forest Whitaker is part of the failure of this film
","One of the problems with 'The Last King of Scotland' is that it is too much a pleasant and commercial film. Dealing with one of the most horrible dictators of the 20th century the makers of this film may have been concerned that the subject is too difficult for a film to be successful. They so try to create a flawless action (although the final looks less credible) and they casted Forest Whitaker to act as Idi Amin. His act is superb, but is also part of the failure of the film in my eyes.The balancing figure of the film and the main character filling the screen time is the dictator personal physician acted by James McAvoy. He is also meant to symbolize the blindness and indifference of the post colonial West, less caring about the human rights in the colonies they just abandoned and failing to understand both local realities as well as the evil of some of the rulers they put in place. However, the young McAvoy is a miscast, he is too young and without being a bad actor misses the complexity and angoisse that must have stroked a real doctor Garrigan.So the film is left on the shoulders of Whitaker, whose Amin is credible, although probably not historically true. His superb acting holds the movie together with the splendid camera work and makes it enjoyable if one can enjoy the fascination of evil, but overall the movie misses to tell many of the truths it could about Africa and dictatorship. I was disappointed.",6,1,3,4 August 2008
"Hail, Caesar!"," diluted Coen brothers
","A few weeks back I wrote about Bridge of Spies and I was mentioning the fact that I expected more than an OK+ story about the Cold War from a script written by the Joel and Ethan Coen brothers. This feeling was now enhanced by viewing Hail, Ceasar!. The trailer was so promising - the anti-establishment brothers made a film about the Hollywood. George Clooney as the drunken (not even, actually) star in the historic super-production. Scarlett Johansson as the blonde brainless starlet. The bigger the expectations, the deeper the disappointment, they say. The brothers seem to have ran out almost completely of ideas and spices.Hollywood loves making fun of itself, but never forgets to mix a dose of nostalgia. This is what made The Artist such a huge success, plus of course the French charm. It's 2016 however, and nostalgia should not be consumed in overwhelming doses. Yet, the Coen brothers seem almost to crawl in repentance to the big studios they succeeded to teach in the past a few things about digging for gold in the classical fabric of American stories. There is only one scene where the Coen spin and spirit succeed to remind the good old days - that's the 'ecumenical' discussion in preparation of the Christ movie with the participation of Catholic, Easter-Orthodox and Protestant priests plus one rabbi. It looked and sounded like a good joke. The difference is that we used to have ten or more such good jokes in the Coen brothers films, now it was just one. The social content which is also present in many of their films is now reduced to a parody of the black-listing of the 50s combined with an incarnation of Communist hysteria (in a Malibu villa by the ocean of all places) which is maybe the second good joke in the film. Still insufficient.In a season that was so deprived of comedies that The Martian got a nomination in the category at the Golden Globes, Hail, Ceasar! is still the funniest show in town, but it's more by lack of competition. George Clooney and Scarlett Johansson looked genuinely bored in a film which should have been fun to make. Josh Brolin is no comedy actor. The ones lucky to get more interesting parts are the amazing Tilda Swinton, and Ralph Fiennes who left me with the dilemma of guessing which film director he took revenge upon when building his character.I am waiting for the Coen brothers to return.",6,0,2,4 March 2016
American Gangster," half-baked mob saga
","'American Gangster' has in place all the ingredients for being one of these big and successful American sagas that Hollywood knows to do too well. The film is built around the true story of an interesting character - Frank Lucas, one of the first Afro-American mob heads, a self made gangster but also a businessman and a man of family, it enjoys the presence on screen two leading actors of Oscar fame, it is directed by a well known name, and even screen time exceeds the two and a half hours, which became kind of normal for the big American films recently.And yet, Ridley Scott's film fails, and the failure is to be found in the two many inconsistencies in building his characters, and in the lack of success of making the story in the film both successful and true to reality. Denzel Washington's interior light and dignity plays an ambiguous role here, we know and like him too much from other scene appearances to really get shocked of his Frank Lucas's evilness, he is more convincing when shown taking his mom to church, or building a business plan or even turning down his accomplices, than when killing a man for to impose his power in a scene which seems out of the character's space. Russell Crowe as detective Richie Roberts is on the contrary more convincing when dealing with his personal troubles, and less when trying to be the on corruptible character who nails Lucas. A typical case of two excellent actors that do a good job but do not raise to the levels of excellency we expect from them.While the parallel lives of the two characters advance on parallel tracks, the tension is built towards the final confrontation that is meant to be the climax of the movie. We are filled in with too many standard and expected stuff from other more minor movies - for example the juxtaposition of the failed family and parental life of the 'good' detective vs. the devoted family life of the gangster. If this is meant to be kind of a social comment - the good guy is paying with his personal life the price of being right, while the bad guy is the one apparently realized, well, this sounds kind of trivial and moralistic. It is only the usage of the TV sequences that puts the story in the perspective of the 60s and 70s and the ravaging effects of the drugs trade on the American society. Nothing new or unexpected here however.'American Gangster' could have been one of these big American sagas. Or maybe not, maybe we had too many of these on screens in the last ten years and we should rather take a break.",6,0,1,28 February 2009
The Reader," a film of two stories
","There are two stories or if you want two different films in this film.The first one is a wonderful love story, starting the 1950s Germany trying to cope with the trauma of the war and of the defeat and to build itself back as a nation and as a country. Michael is a 15 years old teenager discovering love, life and himself. Hanna is 20 years older, a simple woman trying to break the walls of a lonely life. Their relationship starts on a purely sexual way but soon turns into something else, as she starts asking him to read to her loudly from his school literature books. Reading becomes the center and the focus of their affair. One day however she disappears. We find them almost a decade later, when he is a student in law and she is on the accused bank of a SS camp guardians trial, accused of war crimes. He feels betrayed twice by her disappearance, and by her having said nothing about her past. When the occasion comes to ease her punishment by revealing that she is not able to read he fails to do it, he is too ashamed, she is too ashamed, and social conventions again win over truth. The final part of the relationship is sublime. He is now mature, she is old and in prison. He starts sending her recordings of his readings of the preferred book, she finally starts to understand the evil she caused and also the reasons of failure and learns to read and write. It is a relationship that is no longer physical but only spiritual but it still gets only stronger. When liberation time approaches however, Hanna cannot cope with real life - the physical world and and a real relationship with Michael have no meaning for her. The second film or story is a Holocaust theme, but not the usual one. The film happens many years after the war, but the shade of the Holocaust is planing over the whole story. Hanna was one of the blind executioners, her evil deeds had nothing ideological, just reflected the moral decay of the world she lived in. For many years after the war she just lives, does not seem to have any remorse or think too much about what happened. Her process of acknowledging comes late and is not well expressed, she is not a character that explains herself well by any means. The world around here judges and condemns her, but not even the judges have a good answer to the question she asks at the trial'what would you have done in my place?'. It is not that the good answer does not exist, letting 300 Jews burn alive in a church rather than releasing them and risking 'disorder' is obviously the evil choice - but it is the new society that may not be yet strong and good enough to give the appropriate answer. The way the theme of the Holocaust is dealt in this film cannot avoid controversy. Both heroes of the film make at given moments of the story the wrong choices, and none of their tentatives of atonement can really compensate or fix what happened, Many people could read in the telling of such a story by itself a tentative of humanizing the wrong-doers and seeking excuses for the unspeakable. The real answer is given I believe in one of the final scenes, when a survivor of the Holocaust refuses to make any judgments, learn or teach any lessons based on one happened in the camp. This is again a disputable position, but a possible one. Kate Winslet is superb in the role of Hanna, rendering the character with all its simplicity, naivety, lack of sensitivity in many moments tenderness in other, mis-communication, and humanity. For once the Academy may not have been wrong. Her German partner, young actor David Kross succeeds to match her beautifully as the young Michael. I liked less Ralph Fiennes as the mature Michael, but then I seldom like Fiennes. Overall this film asks a lot of important questions and provides back answers that will not make everybody happy, but it's a complex story and the answers cannot be simple. The film did not enjoy too much success, maybe there is a level of saturation because of too many Holocaust movies lately, but 'The Reader' will I think get in time the status of one of the important films of the genre.",9,0,0,30 May 2009
Dark Shadows," vampire games
","When Tim Burton and Johnny Depp come together one already knows what to expect. Dark Shadows is the 8th film directed by Burton with Depp in the cast, the first one being Edward Scissorhands from 1990, maybe the most famous of all. We already know that a fantastic and strange world of weird beauty and ugliness will be created on screen. We know that it will be scary but that we need not take it more serious than necessary because we are now adults and fairy tales do not scare us any longer (do they?). We also know that Depp will again be hard to recognize, but will be himself as well, another entry in a series of fantastic characters that we - who love the actor - wish will last for as long as possible.'Dark Shadows' is inspired by a TV show which gained cult status in the late 60s and early 70s which I have never seen or heard about before. It starts as a Gothic witches and vampires story in the 18th century to continue as a back-from-grave witches and vampire comical action in the contemporaneity of the TV show. Tim Burton and his script writers chose the path of creating from the perspective of 2012 a retro-actual comedy combined with situation gags about the culture, revolts and music of the 70s including a cameo appearance of Alice Cooper. These are actually some of the funniest moments in the film, as the rest of the story is pretty conventional and does not exceed the level of a mediocre comics-inspired intrigue.Acting-wise we have of course Depp, as pale and as weird as ever. Besides Depp the film is blessed with exquisite cast including Michelle Pfeiffer which unfortunately seems lately to fade away from important roles, Eva Green which has a love scene like you never saw on screens before with Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter which I wish had spent more time on screen. And yet, despite moments of fun and splendid visuals that only the imagination of Burton can create, something is missing in the script. I did not see the TV show, and yet I had a very strong feeling of deja vu which could not be completely balanced by acting and spectacular visuals. A movie relying only or mostly on visual effects, as perfect as they may be, risks to feel like unfinished.",7,0,0,21 October 2014
Hancock," more trouble for the superheroes
","One cannot say that the superheroes genre does not renew itself lately. We have seen Batman and Spiderman and the rest of the crowd as kids, teenagers, falling in love, losing and regaining their power, and even starting to look human. On the same line we can place 'Hancock' which starts with the superhero played by Will Smith in a serious moral crisis (I was almost ready to write mid-age crisis, but there is no such thing as mid-age for immortals) that alcohol does not seem to really solve, saving lives but doing too much material damage in the process and losing popularity with the press and public opinion. And then the solutions comes across - PR, how did not he think alone about it - but then the PR man has a beautiful wife, and ... not ... you did not really guess what follows but I will try not to reveal more.While the first part of the film seems to be pretty standard 'hero-in-trouble' stuff the second half hides some surprises, and the idea was pretty cool. The realization is however too standard, director Peter Berg seems to have relied almost entirely on his two stars - Will Smith and Charlize Theron to deliver the sparkles. They do to a certain extent, but this is not enough to make the film something to remember. Smith and Theron are supported by Jason Bateman, who play the more human element of the triangle, and he looks too routine, even more routine that he is supposed to be.Maybe this is the problem with Petr Berg's movies. I have seen recently 'The Kingdom', the film he made before 'Hancock'. These two films belong to very different genres, but they do have something in common. They are both action films that pretend to be more than that. Without really being bad films, both of them fail. Berg should maybe try to break the routine and dare more.",6,2,5,19 September 2009
Hitch," testing the limits of romantic comedy
","'Hitch' is a movie to love for fans of Will Smith and for addicts of date movies and romantic comedy. Will Smith gives a nice pleasing performance in the role of 'dr. Date' a dating counselor who is teaching and passing to his clients the magic and life experience of a charmer. He is matched by the attractive Eva Mendes, an investigative journalist who is set to de-mask the crook in the charmer (if there is one) but cannot avoid falling to the magic herself. Dialogs are quite witty, a good team of supporting actors is doing a good job with special mention for Kevin James whose comic talents deserve a better role I hope he will get some day - in a few words a very reasonable Will Smith romantic comedy. So, why not a better film? Probably because there are limits in the genre itself, and probably because after building a good story and bringing it to the pick of the conflict (to the extent there is a conflict in a romantic comedy) the author of the script does not know exactly what to do next, and lacking ideas the final part of the film is exactly what Hollywood does worst in rose-water conventional happy endings. So after the end of the movie best chances are that we will remember Will Smith but not the movie.",5,1,1,24 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The ending in the middle
","This ending in the middle, following the curious episodes order of the Star Wars Saga fits very well in the circle, and this seems to have been the main goal of Director George Lucas. By the end of the film not only we know how Anakin Skywalker turned into Darth Vader, but we also fit many other pieces of the puzzle at the right place. That's good.On the other hand, this Episode 3 also has many of the flaws to be found in the other installments, especially in the more recent prequel films. The effects are superb, and I can be only sorry because I saw this film on small screen, on DVD, due to being busy or lazy or both. Poor excuse, I know and I am sure I have missed much of the experience only a theater viewing can give. But, and this is the big but, colors are superb, certainly computers graphics are very good, but we have already seen better for example 'Van Helsing' the last one in the LOTR series. Moreover the surprise of seeing a full new world brought on screen from pure imagination that we had in the first 'Star Wars' 28 years ago is not there any longer.And then it's the acting. Hayden Christensen is simply not at the level required by such a film and I would almost say 'like son, like father' because a similar thing happened to Mark Hamill, who played Skywalker's son in the next series (chronology-wise) filmed 28 years earlier. Natalie Portman is OK, but there is no chemistry between the two and the love story simply does not make it from the screen. Not that dialogs help too much, they are too close to chip science fiction, and the exception, the memorable 'This is how democracy dies - in thundering applause' seems more like targeting contemporary politics.Satr Wars fans will love the film, as everything coming from the Lucas studios. Good cinema fans will raise some brows. I am a little bit of the two, so I am a soul divided by now.",8,3,6,4 December 2005
Ray," what Hollywood knows to do best
","Having used many times Hollywood as the reference for big American studio movie making style, commercial and deprived of artistic quality, let me say that 'Ray' is good. it's good because this is what Hollywood is good at - taking a life and bringing it to screen in a cinema epic of dimensions that stays with you for a long time. In a year that brought many American stories and heroes 'Ray' is the best, much more representative than 'Aviator' for example of the times and of the American spirit.It's difficult to say much more that was not said. Jamie Foxx is not acting superbly in Ray, he IS Ray Charles, and the Oscar seems to be in place. The music is superb, the re-creation of the music and social scene of the 50s and 60s seems true. The anti-drug message is somehow too simplistic but is strong and consistent and ends by being moving overall. Unless you hate music films you will enjoy 'Ray' for many reasons.",9,0,2,26 August 2005
Inception," 'Inception' is good, but the hype is greater than the film deserves
","With Inception Christopher Nolan ends a decade in his carrier marked by a series of movies which brought together the best in the traditional Hollywood cinema with intelligent scripts that explore the space beyond reality. His latest film is closer of all his precedent movies to the one that opened the decade and his first success - Memento that he made in 2000 - in being a challenge for the cinema viewers who are asked to do more than just relax and eat popcorn while the story runs for itself. The sophisticated story of dreams control requires attention beyond the usual visual effects satisfaction granted to science-fiction blockbusters watchers.The idea that reality may be a controlled dream of ourselves or of some supernatural divinity, that the world is the subjective summation of thoughts and feelings of all living is not new in philosophy, literature or cinema. It gets however more and more attention lately, also due to the increased popularity of virtual reality computer programs and communication. The script of Inception plays well into the genre, with a team of dream controllers taking the apparently impossible mission of getting into the brain of a corporate shark heir in order to change his mind about the destiny of the corporation. The rather non-important pretext allows Nolan to develop a sophisticated web of action scenes in which reality, dreams, dreams in dreams, and yes, dreams in dreams in dreams play the most important role. All the structure is carefully build, and the logic seemed to me perfect during the viewing, and very well supported by visual effects as well as by the explanations given by the characters.Yet, this is not enough in my opinion to justify the super-hype created around this film although I agree there are not much better in view around this year, and especially not the #4 where it stands now in the IMDb all-time viewers preferences. With the narrative structure put aside we are left with a rather schematic set of characters, some of them incompletely developed despite the almost 2 and a half hour of duration, with a love story which we have seen too many times for us to be impressed despite Leo's presence, and with a sometimes questionable choice of actors (Ellen Page?). For a film with such an innovative structure it is surprising how much stuff is borrowed from the typical Hollywood bag of tricks. Action scenes seem to clone a Bond film, and if the story pretext has any importance we never know actually how the intrigue ends but we are served with a very conventional and sentimental rosy style ending instead. On the good side Leonardo DiCaprio is better and better in each film he acts. As in Memento the idea of the movie is mind-blowing. None of them succeed in being the great film they aspire to be, Memento was too cool (in the negative sense, lacking human touch) and Inception is too conventional in the details of its execution. Both are however films to remember coming from a director who does not seem to know how to make forgettable movies which is certainly no little thing.",8,1,7,20 November 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," Poirot is Back
","It's not easy to adapt Agatha Christie to screen in 2017, and it is even more difficult to take upon 'Murder on the Orient Express' which already had a fabulous and stars-blessed version made in 1974 by Sidney Lumet. The queen of the detective novel created superb mysteries, but there are challenges in bringing them to screen, as her characters are quite theatrical, always hide and seem to be something else that they really are, and the confined enclosure where most of her stories take place does not fit the requirements of dynamics in modern action cinema. It's a challenge to turn the bright mental exercises in her novels into screen action, especially as most of the viewers would know the ending. A challenge that can be compared with bringing to the cinema screens the text and characters of Shakespeare. So, maybe it takes a director and an actor that already brought to screen the plays of Shakespeare to assume the challenge and the risks. The name of this director is, of course, Kenneth Branagh.The approach chosen by the director for this version of Murder on the Orient Express does not try to 'actualize' the intrigue into the present time, but does the contrary - it is very specific about the exact year of the plot, 1934, exactly the year when Agatha Christie's book was published. While keeping the structure of the intrigue and the format of the 'train story' it invests much of the writing and acting efforts into developing the characters. First of all it's Hercule Poirot's life itself which is enhanced with the memory of a lost love, although more details may have been left for the following episodes. Branagh himself assumes the role of Poirot, with Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Willem Dafoe and a wonderful supporting cast providing color and personality to each one of the characters, whatever time they catch on the screen.I enjoyed the experience of watching this version of the classical murder story, even if the solution of the mystery was known to me from the beginning. I believe that Kenneth Branagh succeeded to find the right balance between the old good way of making films with a good story combined with nuanced acting, and the modern visual techniques that place the action in a spectacular landscape adding an aura of fairy tale. The ending alludes to the next episode in what may become a series, and I am looking forward to it.",8,0,2,10 January 2018
Defiance," heroic view of the Bielski bothers story
","'Defiance' tells about one of the lesser known episodes of World War II in which a group of Polish Jews saved themselves from the ghettos and the executions by the German occupiers and their local collaborators and formed a partisans unit in the forests of Belarus. They were led by the Bielski brothers and succeeded to hide more than one thousand of people in the forests, to fight against the German occupiers, and also to form a community that survived the harsh weather and natural conditions in the woods, the fights with the enemies, and also the sometimes tense relations with other non-Jewish partisan groups and with the local population. The story was told in the last decade in several books and historic studies, some revealing not only the heroic story but also some more controversial aspects.The film directed by Edward Zwick focuses on the first year in the three that the group spent in the forests, the year that the group was formed, and the first winter that they had to survive in the woods. It's a story of heroism and survival, of revenge and resilience. Two of the three brothers (originally they were four) are in the center of the story - Tuvia, the leader (Daniel Craig) and Zus the fighter (Liev Schreiber) who at some point joins the Soviet partisans. Both give very credible performances, their dilemma between personal revenge and saving lives, and their conflicts in the ways the group is to be led are well described. Heroism, faith, will to survive and to keep the human dimensions of life are the main motivations of the characters and they come strong on screen. Besides good acting, authenticity and attention to the details in film making are other visible qualities of this movie, together with fluent story telling. The only questionable aspect is the one related to the language - the Jewish characters speak English, they turn sometimes to Russian when speaking with the Soviet partisans and to the local population (was not this supposed to be rather Polish?) in a mix and with switches that are not clear at all and lack authenticity. I am not sure what the better solution would have been, this may be the best an American production can do without losing the American audiences for whom big screen movies must be mostly or fully spoken in English, I guess.'Defiance' belongs to a genre which does not have too many films in its records, the one that deals with the Jewish Resistance during World War II, representing Jews not only as victims but also fighting back, defending themselves and sometimes taking revenge on their murderers and oppressors. The other illustrious example is Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' which was produced and released around the same time, which was a declared work of fiction. Defiance openly advertises being inspired by true events, and it succeeds to present a credible and in some moments moving picture of the few and the brave who had the courage to resist. There is no hint in the film itself or warning in the text introduction or epilogue about the controversies related to the darker aspects of the story, and this is maybe the principal minus of this production.",7,0,1,11 October 2013
Lord of War," Docu-drama? well ... more docu than drama
","Andrew Niccol has a short but exquisite record as writer, producer and director, including 'Truman Show', 'Gattaca' and 'S1m0ne'. He is doing again something different in 'Lord of War' but unfortunately the difference is mainly relative to the quality of his previous record. 'Lord of War' disappointed me, it looks more like a documentary longer than the usual 60 minutes (including commercials) than or a HBO biography feature than like a real feature film.It's not that the subject is not important. Arms traffic is one of the more critical problems in world policy and it certainly deserves a good film. The problem is that 'Lord of War' is not that good film, it is so obviously engaged that even if you agree 100% with the message you shortly become sick of it being repeated again and again. Moreover, there are many details that are superficial and characters that get a soap opera treatment, like all the assortment of bad guys from Ukraine, Liberia and so on.We are certainly left with fine acting from Nicholas Cage. He is good as always, but his character's deepness is spoiled by the fact that he is put to explain himself and philosophize for half of the screening time. Cage does not need this and I believe he would have created a much more interesting character without one word spoken off-screen. The other piece of fine acting is given by Janred Leto. As we are one one night before the Oscars, I wonder why was Leto skipped from the supporting role list of candidates.It's a disappointing film for those who expect a real feature movie from a director like Niccol and an actor like Cage.",6,0,2,4 March 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes as a comics hero
","It was said that Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes would make Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes turn in their graves. I believe this statement to be true to the extent that the latest had a grave.Yes, this version of Sherlock Holmes - which I hear will be soon followed by a sequel - is much more 21st century entertainment. It resembles much more some of the latest and more successful entries in the genre like V for Vendetta or The Dark Knight than 19th century detective stories. It is dark and violent and has political connotations that speak only to these who lived through the 20th century history. It's the kind of entertainment which you watch first to relax (if you like the genre) but yet you do not end viewing it with the feeling that you watched a completely brainless piece of garbage.Much of the quality of Guy Ritchie's version lies in the tormented version of the principal character that is being created by Robert Downing Jr. The rational detective from Baker Street is a man of all sins who is capable not only of reasoning but also of fighting and surviving in a brutal world, as well of feeling deeply for a cared one who betrays him not only once. Then we have a vision of London as a 19th century Cour des Miracles which is rendered in a strikingly poignant manner as a stage of all possibilities becoming true provided they they rely on 19th century most advanced science. I liked this vision and for once the perspective of the sequel does not make me uncomfortable.",7,1,2,12 March 2010
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," a powerful war drama and a moving brotherhood story in the Korean war
","I know very little about director Je-gyu Kang. He made three films overall and quite interestingly none after 'Taegukgi' from 2004. His creation is very different from the one coming from the other famous Korean director Ki-duk Kim, or from the Korean commercial cinema (horror or science fiction films) which is somehow known in the world.'Taegukgi' can be considered to a large extent a replica to 'Saving Private Ryan' by Spielberg. It's a war story involving two brothers caught in the turmoil of the Korean war, with very different personalities and destinies. One of them is the strong character and his initial purpose is saving his younger and weaker brother, sparing him the rest of the war and sending him home. In time his destiny changes and his character seems to head towards the apparently inescapable brutality and insanity of the war. The film becomes at the same time a realistic rendition of a civil war in which the borders between good and evil slowly disappear, as well as a metaphor of the tearing apart of the Korean nation, with the two brothers ending by fighting on opposite camps. The final sacrifice reestablishes the balance but the reconciliation and the peace never come, only death puts end to the life long waiting and desire for getting back together.Much of the screening time is filled with the war scenes, some of the best I have ever seen, and Spielberg's movie comes again in mind as the obvious reference. It is hard to say whether the story of the two brothers happens on the background of the war, or it is the war that catches the center of the attention and the story just flows with it. The effect is however strong, the story is moving and for the non-Korean viewer this is an opportunity to learn something about the history and feelings of a nation that is still divided.",8,1,2,28 May 2009
WALL·E," an overrated film with memorable scenes but no solid story
","Every summer lately has its big animated hit, and sometimes more than one. 'Wall-E' will certainly be the big one of the summer of 2008 and will make a lot of money in the process. I do not share the enthusiasm of the crowds on this one however.There are a few remarkable things in 'Wall-E'. The principal character is cute and nicely drawn, with an E.T. like silhouette. His romantic interest is however deprived of any charm, exception the way she voices 'Wall-Eeeeeee' and we hardly share his enthusiasm for her. The love dance in the starry night is a beautiful piece of animation. The visions of Earth reduced to a garbage dump and the one of the humanity turned into sacks of junk food are haunting, although a little too ideologically explicit. But then between all these we do expect a movie line and a story, and those are not missing but so simplistic and naive that they lack any interest for the adult viewer, and by this I mean anybody older than nine. Graphics are OK but I have seen better from Pixar.When the first viewers enthusiasm will fade out this film will slowly decrease in rating (it has by now a stellar 8.9 in IMDb, and is a neighbor of Lord of the Rings and Usual Suspects) and will melt out from Top 250. We will be left with an animated movie of a few memorable quotes but no real story to connect between them.",5,8,20,14 July 2008
Arrival," another encounter of the third kind
","Almost every season of American cinema in this period brings about at least one big sci-fi production. While in recent years the themes dealt with space exploration within Earth orbit ( 'Gravity' in 2013 directed by Alfonso Cuaron Sandra Bullock and starring George Clooney ) or the planets of our solar system (Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' with Matt Damon last year), 'Arrival' this year returns (as 'Interstellar' by Christopher Nolan, also starring Matt Damon in the title role of 2014) to one of the themes of most popular in the classical literature and film of the genre and namely contact with extra terrestrial civilizations and possible visits and even invasion of our planet by representatives of civilizations more advanced than ours. What can bring new another movie in a genre so popular and populated with significant creations, with branches in all genres from science fiction and apocalyptic visions to technological sparkling comedies and fairy tales that turn extra-terrestrial beings in friendly issues and the films in family-friendly productions? 'Arrival' managed to generate interest because it follows two of the basic rules of success in this sub-genre of science fiction. The first is that a film of 'first contact' must have the focus or pay significant space to humans and their real problems, must have heroes in flesh and blood, with whom viewers can identify. Dennis Villeneuve's film has as the main heroine Louise Banks, a beautiful woman but passed beyond the first youth who has just gone through the terrible trauma of losing a child to an incurable disease. The beginning of the film looks more like the beginning of a psychological drama about post-trauma recovery, and this is what this film is actually in some way. But of course, Louise Banks is a doctor in linguistics and because of this expertise is involved in trying to communicate with the passengers of the 12 spacecraft suddenly appeared in sight of earthlings. Intervenes here second compulsory element in the success of the genre which requires the contact between civilizations to combine in suitable doses the mystery and anguish human contact with the unknown and an explanation which has sufficient scientific logic (or humor or poetry, in other films ) to satisfy curiosity but also to stay with the audience after the film. Here lies the secret of the interest and success of the film.From here starts but actually the most difficult part. For us, people (scientists or movie viewers), imagination is the only tool that we have at hand to imagine how the inhabitants of other planets physically look. Dreams and nightmares may take the forms, but the filmmakers have a duty to bring the extra-terrestrial on-screen, to shape dreams and imagination. Many movie genre filmmakers often failed, because when dreams becomes concrete substance, interest and expectations often melt into disappointment. You can not say that in 'Arrival' this issue is resolved, rather it is avoided or marginalized in style. Extra-terrestrial in Villeneuve's film are seven-legged creatures looking like octopuses, but to relieve the feeling of revulsion or physical danger there always is a screen between them and people. Viewers' attention is directed to the central theme of the film which is the possibility or impossibility of dialogue between civilizations that can be very different in their biological characteristics and stages of development and therefore use highly specific media each.The main question the heroes in 'Arrival' are faced with is related to the intentions of the extra-terrestrials. To judge them in the image, likeness and intentions of humanity can be a fatal mistake. But ignorance can be fatal and potential hazards are present. Why did the extra-terrestrials come on our planet? What are their intentions? Cooperation or exploration, or conversely, the monopolization of resources (which ones?) on our planet and maybe annihilation? How can be established communication with them, how can their messages be translated when the bases are unknown language they use and even fundamental pillars of their way of thinking are different? I will not give too much detail because I do not want to take away from the joy of watching a film that I recommend to everyone. Of course, the lead heroine plays a key role in the solution of the problem and the answer will come in the end and is related to her biography and traumas that had she went through.The film is based on a story by writer Ted Chiang, winner of the Nebula Award, one of the most important distinctions of genre, in 2000. The text addresses many aspects of the theory of language, perception of time and determinism underlying human communication, and develops a principle known in linguistics and epistemology as the 'Sapir-Whorf hypothesis' or 'relativity language', after which language determines or at least influences the way of thinking, knowledge, and the decision-making of those who use it. Screenwriter Eric Heisserer and director Dennis Villeneuve found screen equivalents to some of the ideas of the story and added further elements, some more successful (i.e. the very credible 'international' response the arrival of extra-terrestrials) other less to my taste (resolving at the last moment the inter-civilization the crisis that is on the brink of armed conflict seemed too 'Hollywood-ish'). The film's graphics solutions for the relations between civilizations at first contact are well suited and exceptionally aesthetic. There are too many details in this film about extra-terrestrial technology, and about the secrets that they want to transmit to mankind, and all these make this movie worth seeing.",8,0,4,11 February 2017
The Terminal," best airport movie
","I usually avoid seeing films while traveling, despite flying quite often over the Ocean. Cinema experience does not fit well for me with the poor sound, very small screens, and airplanes food. I could not resist however seeing 'The Terminal' both because the movie was presented by the airline before the DVD is out, and also because this is definitely The Movie to see in-flight. It's about airports after all, and I am spending nowadays part of my life on airports!Well, I am not sorry at all. This is a typical Spielberg film, and with the exception of 'Schindler's List' here we have a film maker who cannot care less about credibility. His film making is about emotions, relationships, fears and monsters, and we have all of these in the film. The story is of an East European tourist, who finds himself stuck in the no land zone of a New York airport after his passport is being made valid by a military coup in his country. He is not allowed to enter the US, he cannot return home, or fly some other place. He became a non person in international law terms.The best part of the film was for me the culture clash between the main character and the bureaucratic machine he needs to face. The message is that there is more humanity in his naive, East-European approach to life then in the government clerks supposed to represent the 'Western civilization'. America is an immigrant society, and this film tries to remind this basic fact. This is not supposed to be realistic life description, but more a symbolic confrontation, somehow similar to a Chaplin character facing the Big Machine. There is no other word to describe Tom Hanks performance but perfect. A good supporting cast provides the comic counterpoint. There is not too much to say about Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is beautiful, and this is all what the role required. This may not be one of Spielberg's best films, but even when he does an average film Spielberg succeeds to make it interesting, and in this case funny. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",8,1,2,4 October 2004
Parasite," wars of the classes
","We've only been through the middle of 2019, but I think that I can mark the fact that I experienced the cinema event of the year, or at least one of the important events of the year in movies. This is the film by Korean director Joon-ho Bong, 'Gisaengchung' / 'Parasite'. It has already received 'Palme d'Or' at the Cannes festival, and this time I believe that the jury's choice is extremely appropriate. 'Parasite' is a profound and complex cinematographic work, which does not hesitate to ask painful questions about the huge differences between the social classes and the deep prejudices that divide them in today's world, but it does so in an elegant and expressive way, with images. and characters who have a chance to remain in the memory of the spectators for a long time, causing them to reflect but also engaging them with a captivating story.At the center of the story of the film are two families from today's South Korea, located at the two extremes of the society. The Parks live in a spacious and luxurious villa, full of works of art and surrounded by green landscape. He is the CEO of a large company, she is a spoiled housewife, the kids, a girl and a boy are even more spoiled. They are all surrounded by servants, drivers, tutors for children. The Kis live crammed into an unhealthy half-underground flat. The parents are unemployed, their children are smart young people, but with little chance of overcoming their social condition because of the poverty. The homes of the two families play a significant role in the story, the luxury and order of the Parks' villa hides secrets, while the claustrophobic disorder of the Kis' family home is similar to that of the family in the movie 'Shoplifters' of the Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda. The destinies of two families accidentally intersect when the boy in the poor family becomes (with the help of forged references) the private tutor of the daughter of the rich family. As relationships intensify, cultural differences seem to diminish, the less fortunate family being equal or even superior in adapting to life and in the cultural interactions. Until about halfway through the movie, the audience is watching a social satire in a light style, a kind of 'rich family vs. poor family' story. And then everything changes.A few weeks ago, writing about another Korean film, I noticed that many of the films that came from there defy genre cataloging and combine different styles into original and surprising mosaics. 'Parasite' is yet another example in this regard. We have here manifested social satire, melodrama, humor, love among teenagers, horror in the Gothic style, comments on art, a natural catastrophe, neo-realistic poverty and soap operas wealth. Stanley Kubrick and Yorgos Lanthimos are quoted. The natural tendency of the spectator to take the part of the oppressed in the class conflict that takes place in front of us is put to the test by the events that happen on the screen. 'Parasite' is an excellently acted movie, filmed in style, a story with many ramifications and meanings, which will not be easily forgotten by the spectators and which gives them material to think about the society and the world in which we live.",9,6,31,9 August 2019
The Big Short," the end of capitalism?
","Was Karl Marx right with his critics and analysis about the capitalist system, its crisis, and inequalities? The question must have crossed the minds of many people faced with the periodic failures of the world economy and financial systems in the last couple of decades, which seem to have made the poor poorer, ruined into poverty millions of people who were part of the middle class, while making many of the rich richer. The question is asked indirectly also by the makers of 'The Big Short' directed by Adam McKay, probably the best film made until now about the crush of the real-estate market followed by the financial system which started in 2007, and to some extent continues until today.The housing market in the United States was expanding and seemed to be rocky solid in the 1990s and the early 2000s. It was supported by a banking system which did not only provided the credits that allowed all the strata of the population reach the house of their dreams, but also created new money from money and profits from profits for the investors. This kind of bubble BTW persists until today and endangers all the capitalist economy. The film describes how a few people involved with the investment funds and banking systems had foreseen the fall ('The Big Short') and made a profit out of it investing in credit default swaps, kind of insurance policies against the deficit of a system which was supposed never to fail. If you want this was like buying insurance policies against earthquakes with the confidence that an earthquake will happen in the next two years in one of the most stable areas in the world.Director McKay took a documentary book (Michael Lewis' 'The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,') and turned it into docu-fiction of the best quality. In order to explain how the system worked he used the narrator who is also one of the heroes (played by Ryan Gosling) and a few real life celebrities to explain the dry financial terms. I certainly did not become an expert in economics after seeing this film, but I can understand what chef Antoine Bourdelle means with taking lower quality ('B rated') sea-food and putting it in his bouillabaisse, package with his 'AAA rated' prestige. The smart heroes take life each on screen thanks to well written dialogues and fine performances of such actors as Gosling, Christian Bale, Steve Carell, or Brad Pitt.'The Big Short' proves that the financial and banking system that is supposed to support the capitalist economy is ill. It also proves that Hollywood at its best can make relevant movies that touch real life, while being good entertainment for smart viewers. In what concerns the question 'was Karl Marx right?' the answer is in my opinion that he was right in part of the analysis of the capitalist system, but was completely wrong in what concerns the cure. If a cure exists for the capitalist system, its name is certainly not communism.",9,0,1,4 June 2016
The Conjuring," ridiculous
","I usually have little problem accepting genre conventions. Without being a big fan of exorcism or daemon's hunting films, I believe that I understand the rules of the genre. Something odd (and bad) happens however with The Conjuring. It takes the genre seriously.Director James Wan has the original Saw in his directing record, and he was the executive producer of the next six films in the series. He should know something about genre rules. One golden rule is that you either need to abstract the details to give the story a more generic touch (this is what was done with Saw which could be seen as a pure horror exercise, enhanced by the claustrophobic and time bomb effects), or include a touch of humor or some other elements to allow detachment of viewers from the 'tough' stuff. The damaging mistake made in my opinion in The Conjuring is that not only that none of these two elements is present, but also that all the story is taken so much in serious up to the claiming that it is inspired by true events and characters. What if you are not a Roman-Catholic, if you do not believe in daemons, if you doubt (as many Internet sources do) that Ed and Lorraine Warren (the couple of demon fighters in the movie) were really anything else than story tellers at best, fraud at worst? This film does not let you room to enjoy, because if you do not accept the convention little makes sense - story, dialogues, characters.There is some good horror cinema in this film, which tried and to some extent succeeded to paint the action in a retro early 70s atmosphere, using film means of that period. However, the weak premises of the story make everything look artificial, and when noises become more strident and bodies start being dragged faster or fly higher, the lack of credibility is so strong, that it the even more ridiculous solution comes as some kind of relief.Avoid!",3,0,1,12 April 2017
Wonder Woman," enjoyable
","So we bought our tickets and our medium sized popcorn box (usually lasts about 15 minutes in the movie), grabbed the 3D spectacles and sat in the theater to watch Wonder Woman. That's the way to do it. Each genre has its rules and one needs to know a minimum of them before entering the cinema theater or starting to see a movie on TV or on his/her preferred viewing device. When I chose to see a super-heroes comics inspired movie I do not expect a lot of realism or credibility from the story, and these are not the films where I am looking for lessons about life. On the other hand I am ready for fun entertainment, for action and special effects, I hope to see a coherent story with actors performances that make me care about the characters. I do not care about the laws of physics, but I hope there will be some humor and that the good guys will eventually prevail.Many of the super-heroes movies nowadays do actually carry some cultural background, it's just a different type of culture, and it helps, although it is not mandatory, to know it. 'Wonder Woman' is a character that combines the mythology of comics stories with the other mythology, the ancient Greek one, the one we read about and maybe learned about in school. Invented during WWII, at a time when women were playing an increasing role in supporting the war effort, mostly by undertaking the roles played in economy by the men sent to fight, but not on the first line of the front, the character of princess Diana (yes, this is the name of the character) carries a strong feminist message. The authors of the script and director Patty Jenkins moved the origins of the story to the end of WWI, the war that was supposed to end all wars. By the way, hard to believe that this talented director is at her only second film, and that 14 years passed since her remarkable debut with Monster. They brought the princess from her isolated island somehow hidden in the mist of mythology, in a tentative to really end all wars. We all know that the tentative failed. In the process the hero will learn a few things about men and evils of mankind, will avoid and block a whole arsenal of bullets and bombs and will kick many bad guys to dust.I enjoyed 'Wonder Woman' because of a few good reasons. The feminism of the message is never dogmatic and almost always impregnated with a dose of self-irony. Gal Gadot who plays the lead role may not be a great actress, but she has the looks, is very well fit physically and typologically for the role. The film is very much the story of her coming to age while learning to understand mankind and fighting on the side of the good guys. She does it with the smile of a teenager on her face and radiates optimism and belief in truth which somehow becomes credible and succeeds to overcome the horrors of the carnage fields of the world war we see on screen. While playing well on the mythology grounds, the story has enough humor to avoid being dry or pathetic and lets us understand we are still in fantasy land. I also liked the special effects, especially in the opening scenes when the Amazons fight the uneven battle with the war machines created by men since they were lost in history. The color palette of the cinematography was well adapted to the different phases of the story, although the 3D spectacles made it (again) too dark - there is something that needs improvement in the technology here. I also liked two of the supporting actors - Chris Pine who succeeded to be the nice guy without being over-sweet (also because of the dose of humor invested in his role), and especially David Thewlis which I have seen previously in Fargo and who develops to be a formidable actor. I liked less the other characters, especially the bad guys, who were, well ... cartoonish. The end of the story was a little disappointing. It looked like one of these epic superheroes endings, but the careful preparation and building that preceded prepared me for something better. It leaves however clearly the path open for the sequels and I will be making reservations when pre-sales tickets become available.",7,4,11,14 June 2017
Paths of Glory," the first masterpiece of Kubrick
","'Path of Glory' would not have happened without Kirk Douglas. He not only makes here one of the deepest and most human roles of his acting career, but also put all his influence and some money into determining the great studios to make this anti-war film, which became the first in a series of great anti-war films of Kubrick. The story of the first world war French soldiers sent to an almost sure death by their corrupted generals and then randomly court-martial-ed and sent to death for cowardice when they face the predictable failure is turned by Kubrick into a splendidly built and beautifully filmed pledge for humanity. And it is humanity that prevails despite the tragic destiny of the soldiers. The final scene in which soldiers join a German prisoner girl into humming a simple German love song is a scene of redemption and of pure shaming of nationalism. Kubrick was still, at least at that point in his life and career an optimist.",10,2,3,29 June 2009
Marriage Story," anatomy of a divorce
","'Marriage Story' directed by Noah Baumbach has been compared by many people to 'Kramer Vs. Kramer 'and I can't help suspecting that this comparison was encouraged by or even originated in the PR machine of the film's producers. There are indeed many similar traits: both films belong to the genre of 'divorce films' and have as protagonists couples who have serious reasons to break up but also maintain strong emotional bonds; in both stories there is a child at an age at which the separation of parents cannot remain without the sequels who becomes the main subject of the custody dispute and divorce settlement; lawyers play an important role in deepening the conflicts; in the lead roles in the two films appear well-known and highly talented actors who combine their magnetism (of attraction and rejection), managing to create difficult-to-forget broken couples on screens. It remains to be seen if this recipe will work with the same success at the 40-year interval that separates the release of the two films. Matching the five Academy Awards collected by 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' is a challenge.What has changed in the dynamics of divorce and the attitude of society in the 40 years that separate the two films? Charlie and Nicole, the divorced of 2019, could ultimately retain their affection and share the responsibility of child custody without lawyers or the institution of marriage, but eventually the social pressure brings them in the situation of the classic couples in legal conflict. As in the 1979 film, it is the wife who initiates the divorce, but the world has changed and the reasons have changed. Joana Kramer (Meryl Streep) was leaving Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) because he was too busy with his professional life and neglected his father and family duties. Charlie from 'Marriage Story' (Adam Driver) is an almost perfect husband and father, but the marriage suffocates Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) whose career as an actress stagnates in the shadow of the talented theater director who is her husband. The characters in Noah Baumbach's film are equal in professional aspirations, and in the affection that continues beyond the legal conflict and the legal separation, and also in the responsibility of the breaking up of the marriage. In fact, maybe they should never have married, that seems to be one of the possible lessons of the movie.I am convinced that there are many different interpretations and opinions, and that 'Marriage Story' is currently being discussed in many families, circles of friends, social networks. One of the merits of the film is that the situation presented on screen and the rich and complex characters of the two main heroes open the appetite for such discussions. The acting performance of the two is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson plays one of the best roles of her career - she is assertive and vulnerable, ambitious and skeptical of doubts, a devoted but catchy mother, and an actress who does not give up her dream of success and achievement on screen. I know Adam Driver less, I have seen him in 'Star Wars', here he shows that he can play excellent and earthly roles. Some sequences suffer from excessive verbosity, but the actors manage to execute them with great vigor. I saw with great pleasure also Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, in the roles of lawyers of both parties, secondary but also key roles in the development of the story, both acting with aplomb and with a well-dosed sarcastic criticism. I was less excited about the insertion of the musical sequences towards the end, they do not fit well with the rest of the movie, they are too little for a musical and useless for a family drama. Despite less successful parts and ideas, 'Marriage Story' - which might have been called 'Divorce Story' as well - manages to captivate because of the topic and of the remarkable acting performances.",7,5,8,31 December 2019
The Queen," splendid performance from Helen Mirren, but too much TV-like stuff
","This could have been one astonishing movie had the script writers and the director the courage to deal with some of the subject lines that keep being just hinted under too much expected TV biopic like stuff. I will leave to other to comment whether the movie is pro or anti-monarchy, maybe it's just neutral in the good BBC tradition. The story of the week between Diana's death is a good opportunity for one film or more about the birth of the myth of Saint Diana, about the faith of the British dynasty and its adaptability and amazing survival into modern times, or about a dysfunctional family who is at helm or close to it in the monarchic democracy of today, but is as remote from its own people as like being on a different planet. It is only the last line of action that gets some decent treatment, yet here also the TV instincts of the director seem to prevail and the result looks a few inches too close to TV comedy, rather than to serious political drama. It is really a pity, we are left just with the superb act of Helen Mirren - here being for once an Oscar prize I believe was deserved - and all the other interesting movies that could have been are left for the future to come into existence.",6,1,3,17 August 2008
Blow," Just Boring
","True crime stories have been a subject of a few good movies, and much more failures. 'Blow' belongs to the second category. Nothing interesting happens in this movie, the story is conventional and previsible, the characters never develop beyond cheap melodrama. Nothing of the devastation of drug culture shows up on the screen. Gangsters love their daughters? So what? Just boring. I never liked Jonny Depp, but what a waste of Penelope Cruz talent to appear in such a movie! 6/10 on my personal scale.",6,0,1,22 February 2003
Vanilla Sky," A Strange Combination
","This film is a surprising and strange combination. It starts as a kind of crime psychiatric story, gets fast into the rich-boy-has-all-and loses-all track, drives through many sentimental twisted with Tom Cruise split between the beautiful but brainless singer (Cameron Diaz) and the intellectual true love Spanish dancer (Penelope Cruz) and towards the end turns into something very different that I will not describe in order to avoid writing a spoiler.The film has surprising twists. Its main problem is that it is too long - it could have been a much better film if it was 20 minutes shorter. American directors did not learn that long shots are effective in European movies only because they are backed by psychological depth. Even so, the length of the plot and some of the flat acting (Kurt Russell for example) are compensated by the intriguing development at the end of the movie. As a viewer I was rewarded by the sentiment that I saw something different than the usual banal stuff, even if my patience was badly tried.",7,0,0,25 August 2002
The Dark Knight Rises," heavy and over-rated
","'Batman' series and in general the super-hero movies are supposed to be popular entertainment. Their 'literary sources' if they can be named so are in the comics books enjoyed by the kids and teenagers of the 30s and 40s which grew older and did not really know to much other literature, and then passed the same taste for direct action, plots that many time passed the border of the credible and 'deux-ex-machina' solutions of the story involving in most cases the super-heroes with their super-powers. After a first generation of movies building the premises of their success from the visual effects that tried to equate the thrills on the printed paper later productions emphasized other aspects of the story - like the romantic aspects (the 'Lois and Clark' TV series that I enjoyed greatly) or the growing pains of the hero on his path to become a reluctant superhero.Comes now this Nolan adaptation. I must say that I greatly admire Nolan for much of his early work, but my feeling was that in the New Batman series he simply failed. The million of dollars invested in special effects or in paying the superb cast (or I should say the cast of superb actors) are mostly lost in a story that grew too much became too complicated. I loved some of the early work of Nolan, movies like 'Memento' or 'Insomnia' with true characters faced with credible dilemmas in real life. Even in the later more sophisticated (and more expensive) movies like the Prestige or Inception his characters have their own truth despite the twist and a-reality of the stories. Here there are two many characters some of which are redundant with other, and the story becomes too complicated with no real reason (it can be easily told in 5 sentences and 50 words, but the film lasts close to three hours).Christian Bay, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine (where does his character hide for most of the film?), Marion Cotillard, Ann Hathaway, and the splendid Joseph Gordon Lewitt are all fine talents. Christopher Nolan is a fine director. The film they made? - not fine and even not fun.",5,1,4,9 March 2014
Black Panther," entertainment for kids of different ages
","The usual introduction and disclaimer applies. When I chose to go to a comics-inspired movie I expect a different type of experience than the one that I expect when I go do a Shakespeare-inspired film or an European art production. Yet, there are good films and bad films and I have seen all of them in all genres. Within the limits of its genre I did not find 'Black Panther' directed by Ryan Coogler to be a very good film and it's difficult to me to understand the enthusiastic reception given to it by some of the film critics that I otherwise agree with most of the time. It's not a bad film either. It's just average.The idea could actually work as most of the ideas of comics-based characters. A meteorite hit Earth million of years ago bringing with it a precious metal, vibranium, stronger than anything we know plus some curative properties. Vibranium is something like the reverse of kryptonite which was annihilating the powers of Superman, with the difference that while the Black Panther superhero can use it and become superhero by drinking it in liquor form, his whole nation of Wakanda can enjoy its power and build an advanced underground civilization in a secluded area of Africa, with one of the poorest countries on Earth as a cover above the ground. If you did not hear about Wakanda you should not worry, you probably did not hear about many of the - say - 20 poorest nations on Earth members of the UN. The adventures of young king T'Challa who ascended to the throne and is confronted with many internal and external threats and enemies as well as with the dilemma whether to continue the isolationist policies of his father and ancestors ('Wakanda first' :-) ) or open and share his technology with the rest of the planet and especially with the oppressed categories on it are the essence of the story. The rest is CGI and 3D effects.It is visible that film director Ryan Coogler made a serious effort to add a layer of serious items to the basic comics story. Allusions to current events in the US and rest of the world like racial inequities, war as a mean of settling conflicts and isolationism are more than transparent. The treatment they get in the film is pretty conventional and there are no surprises or dilemmas, there are more questions than answers. Characters are quite well differentiated but their depth does not exceed the two dimensions of the comics heroes - we pretty much know from start what they will be doing and how they will react to various challenges. Good acting by a few well known and other lesser known actors could not add too much, not even the fantastic Forest Whitaker or Angela Bassett. Computer graphics are spectacular but they lack innovation, I found them to be at the middle of the road between 'Star Wars' and 'The Jungle Book' (the animated version). One atop the other, it's reasonable entertainment for kids of all ages (and I include myself in this category) but it's not up to the buzz.",5,0,0,21 April 2018
Blade Runner," a science-fiction classic keeping its dark glamour
","It is said that this is one of the classics of science fiction that influenced many of the films made in the following two decades. I think the reason lies not that much in the usual science fiction effects (which are not bad) but in the original and well structured idea - robots are on many regards more human the homo sapiens species. Add to this one of the best acts in the career of Harrison Ford, the retro-futuristic landscape and Vangelis' musical track - and here you have both an enjoyable movie experience and a 'classic' that keeps much of its original dark glamour.",9,0,0,7 January 2000
Bruce Almighty," God as mainstream comedy item
","I like Jim Carrey, and consider him the big comedy star of the American screen nowadays. Yes, he does remind us Jerry Lewis, but this is a tradition that goes back even farther, to the days of the mute comedy, and I do not find this a problem - quite the contrary. 'Bruce Almighty' is a(nother) comedy about God being busy, or just tired, and relenting some of his powers to earthy creatures. The lucky winner (or victim) is the very human TV reporter played by Jim Carrey, a typical mix of egocentrism and good sentiments, as any of us is. Some of the gags are really good, and the film develops well for the first two thirds of the time. No deep philosophy, but decent morality in the clothes of good comedy. Unfortunately, in the last third the movie really goes in the very center of the mainstream, trying to make happy all the family viewers in the most fundamentalist homes. This does not help the level and impression the movie makes as a whole. Jim Carrey is good as always, Jennifer Aniston prepares her post-Friends career and may catch soon the place that Meg Ryan just left free as the US cinema sweetie of the decade. My grade for this film is also 2/3 -  or 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7,1,3,7 February 2004
Casino Royale," what does it take for a good Bond movie?
","Indeed, what does it take to make a good Bond movie? If we are to judge according to the first 20 films in the series we need an actor who can identify himself as a sex-symbol with enough sense of humor to compensate the savage killing he is exercising in each film, we need at least three cars or other vehicles races ending in spectacular explosions, we need exotic locations, we need at least two Bond babes usually a good one and a bad one, and a spectacular evil character which usually will offer the better chances for an interesting role. And of course we have M. with his/her authority and Q. with his gadgets, and miss Moneypenny eternally in love with Bond.Here is series 21. As the Bond books were exhausted we are back at book one and director Martin Campbell is taking us into some unknown territory. Not only that M. is a Dame Dench (this is not new I guess) and Q. has a new face, and miss Moneypenny is absent, but here is a blonde Slavic type of Bond played by Daniel Craig (quite a good performance) who makes the mistake of becoming really emotionally involved. A married Bond in the next series? Not really, but worth watching this.Does the more human Bond make sense? Does the renewed Bond series make sense in a world with no global cold war, but with a lot of small hot local wars and terrorist after each corner? The jury is still out there. Until then it is worth seeing this latest Bond movie - it is quite well made, I did not get bored despite the long screen time, although I found the final too much out of tune with the rest and with the Bond style. I will still watch for what will come next, maybe there is indeed a Bond for each generation.",6,1,5,14 June 2008
Signs," Spoiler? maybe - but the director was the greater spoiler!
","'Signs' begins very well - kind of an early Spielberg like aliens story. Mel Gibson is good as he can be, Joaquin Phoenix whom I saw recently in 'Buffalo Soldiers' is an amazing actor, and the tension is slowly building. An then, two thirds in the film, you are due for a big surprise. It is really a turn in the subject, in the characters evolution and in the message. I am not going to reveal more but high chances are that you will either love it or hate it! Unfortunately, I fall in the hating category, and some of the scenes in the last third of the film are, in my opinion close to the ridicule. However, I know that many people will like the turn, and believe me - it is a matter of faith. What wasted talent! 6/10 on my personal scale.",6,0,1,4 May 2003
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen in Europe
","The typical Manhattan director transplanted himself to Europe. His previous films were set in London, now he reached the continent and Barcelona is the setting of his summer romantic comedy 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. The setting of many European films becomes background for another classic Allen show, gathering a couple of gorgeous American female tourists and a suicidal ex-wife around the super-sexy Javier Bardem. Everybody is neurotic despite living a life without any apparent care and any expense report to fill. Their personal problems seem to be their whole universe. The scheme seems to work pretty well and pretty the same way in many of the films of Allen in the last two or three decades - it works due to the fluency and witness of the dialogs and of the splendid actors that love to star in his movies. This is not however his best cinema in my opinion. Allen is at his best when craziness exceeds and displaces the thin intellectual wit - an Yidischer Mamma speaking from the skies or a spectacled sperm cell waiting to be launched to fulfill his destiny. It is not the case here. VCB is another Manhattan story of Allen, disguised as an European summer comedy.",5,0,2,23 May 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," no match for the first movie
","Director Shekhar Kapur tries with this sequel to ride on the success of his first 'Elizabeth' movie one decade earlier. However, despite the promising premises of a story of love, war and politics centered around one of the most fascinating characters in the history of England and of the world he largely fails. His rendition of the crucial years of the reign of Elizabeth the time when the English monarch renounces marrying ever, faces internal rebellion from her Catholic subjects, decides to execute Mary Stuart and is caught by the remorse of this deed, lives the impossible passion for the pirate turned politician lord Walter Raleigh, and eventually faces the deadly danger of the invasion of England by the then superpower Spain to prevail in glory and make out of England a great nation tend to be accurate in their historical details but lack the power to create emotion. The counter-performance is even more amazing taking into account that a magnificent team of actors serves the director in this film. Individually the performances of Cate Blanchett, Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush or Samantha Morton are each of them close to the best level we can expect from such fine actors, but they somehow do not link one with the other and fail to interest the viewer on the human plane. The emotional response from viewing this second 'Elizabeth' is similar to the one of seeing a fine documentary or docudrama about that historical period. Too little for such a gathering of talent.",5,1,2,28 May 2009
Identity," Good Thriller, Definitely Worth Seeing
","Agatha Christie meets 'Psycho' in this surprisingly good thriller. With a well written story full of many hidden twists, well acted and directed with a sure hand, the film caught and kept my attention for the whole duration of its 90 minutes.

Saving Mr. Banks," a melodrama about the making of a melodrama
","Here is an interesting situation. I love cinema and I like the 'movies about movies' genre which I believe has provided some of the best films in the history of the seventh art. Saving Mr. Banks is however a film about a movie that I did not like - Mary Poppins. I was a kid when it was released but I was already disliking melodramas and I failed to be captivated by musicals unless they included my kind of favorite music which was pop and rock. I am still looking for a film by the Walt Disney studios that is credible and contains enough emotion and less sugar to make me feel good during the screening and after it. Director John Lee Hancock's film about the making of Mary Poppins could not change my mind. From my point of view the film inherits many of the flaws of the original. Of course, fans of the original may like Saving Mr. Banks as well, but I do not belong to the category.The period is the early 60s, the action takes place in London and California, but do not expect anything about the emergence of the pop or hippies to show up in screen. The background is actually exactly the world against which the pop and hippie movements revolted. Famous British writer P.L. Travers goes to Los Angeles to work on the screen adaptation of her novel by famous producer (and theme parks owner, and author of the most charming animated cartoons in history) Walt Disney and his studios. The cultural clash between the two personalities although filled of stereotypes is the funniest part of the film, with the feelings of the estranged author surrounded by what she considers the Californian kitsch superbly brought to screen by Emma Thompson. I like much less the parallel story line about the childhood of the author where the authors of the script of Saving Mr. Banks sought the 'deep' motivation of the novel and the resulting film. All this parallel run of the stories looked to me melodramatic and superficial. The scene that is supposed to be the emotional peak, with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) flying to London to reverse the decision of the author and obtain the screening rights includes a short speech that is close to ridiculous.We all know the end of the story. Mary Poppins was eventually made, it was the first 'serious', big stars, big screen movie of the studios which have achieved in the decades after a front range position with combinations of the animated and actors movies, becoming champions of the 'family films' genre. The film about its making gathers a lot of acting talents, beside Hanks (who must have put about 15 extra kilos for this role) and Thompson we have Colin Farrell in the role of the loving but failed father of the writer and Paul Giamatti in a charming supporting role of the only Californian that P.L. Travers ended by really liking.'Saving Mr. Banks' eventually delivers what some people and the producers expect from it - squeezing tears. It does it however the same way the original 'Mary Poppins' film did - using the melodrama tools. So it's a melodrama about the making of a melodrama. Nothing more, a little less. Mary Poppins had the music.",6,0,1,3 December 2016
Jojo Rabbit," the coming to age of the rabbit
","'Jojo Rabbit', Taika Waititi's film arouses controversy among film critics and viewers. Normal for a satirical comedy dealing with the darkest period in history? Perhaps, however, we should not be so shocked anymore, and not because almost eight decades have passed since the horrific events, but because World War II, the Holocaust and even Hitler's persona have already been subjects of comedy and satire in numerous films, some even very good - starting with Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator', continuing with the French comedies with Louis de Funes, moving on to Roberto Benigni's superb and moving film 'Life is Beautiful' and reaching Tarantino. And yet, Taika Waititi was able to make this film only by financing it as a producer and making it as a director and as an actor in the most delicate role - Adolf Hitler's as an imaginary friend of a ten-year-old boy raised in the poisonous atmosphere of the Third Reich and fanatical in his worship of the Fuhrer and in his hatred of Jews. The film describes the tragic coming to age and awakening to reality of Jojo, the aspiring Nazi child, unable to kill a rabbit, hence the nickname in the film's title, during a disastrous war ending for the world he believed in and he lived by until then.The directorial approach and the style in which the story is exposed, at least in the first part of the film, resembles nothing of what I saw on screens in the films about World War II. In fact, the film may be looked at differently: as a combination of coming to age and early exit from childhood movies in extreme conditions (Giuseppe Tornatore's 'Malena' would be another example) and an anti-racist and anti-militaristic satire with clear references to the contemporary period. As a film about the war and the Holocaust, 'Jojo Rabbit' does not say many new things. Jojo's conquering character splendidly played by Roman Griffin Davis, one of the most memorable children's roles of late, dominates the film. The world we see on the screen is his world, with the fears and imagination of a ten year old boy raised in the shadow of war and educated in a twisted ideology. The relationship between his mother (Scarlett Johansson) and Jojo is a relationship mixing love and fear, the mother's fear of the monster that her son might become, maternal protection combined with the fear that Jojo may, intentionally or not, denounce her for her opinions and actions.The film works very well in the first part, the grotesque kitsch of Nazi education and the sick fantasy of the kid's 'imaginary friend' Adolf Hitler managing to create the effects expected by the director. Things get a little complicated when Jojo discovers the 'enemy', a Jewish girl his mother was hiding in their home at the risk of her life, and who, to his surprise, has neither horns nor tentacles. Here begins the process of awakening and coming to age, accelerated by the approach of the end of the war, which brings with it the destruction and death that the fanatical children born and educated in Nazism had been hitherto spared of. The story now slips into melodrama, not before providing one more grotesque and tense scene, when the family home is visited by Gestapo. The ending is less original, and the mix of dream (actually a nightmare in this phase) and reality is no longer as interesting. Until then, however, 'Jojo Rabbit' has already provided many interesting ideas, original and moving sequences, and a lesson that stays with the viewers about the grotesque of hate. Taika Waititi's film may not be an immediate public success, but its fame may develop and last into the future instead.",8,0,1,7 January 2020
Lucy," viewers brains are still used at 10% ... or less
","Lucy was supposed to be a film I should highly enjoy. I love Scarlett Johansson not only for the way she looks but also for daring to undertake complex and different roles that put at work her acting talent. Science fiction is one of the genres I like most. I liked everything that Luc Besson does  actually everything he did until this film. In my opinion 'Lucy' is a low for both Scarlett and Luc as well. It's not terribly bad, as they are too good artists and professionals to fall too low, but it's highly unsatisfying, well below expectations.Readers of popular science magazines, or watchers of the similar TV shows should be already familiar with the scientific pretext of the film. The complex and sophisticated computing machine which is our brain is barely used, maybe at 10% of its capacity. If somehow (maybe using a blue powder drug!) the brain efficiency was used at a higher percentage the respective individual would get capabilities that are well beyond average to the point that they may seem superhuman to the other mortals. This is what happens to the hero in 'Lucy' but the problem is that the combination of sexy techno-thriller does not work well with the pseudo-science in the film. Talking about the meaning of life and universality of time in-between car chases and the destruction of the French Academy by bullets and mortars is some kind of fun, but not much more.When talking about many other films made in Hollywood I have often complained about their length. It's seldom today to find a feature film that does not reach 120 minutes of projection, and in many cases American (and not only American) productions exceed the 150 threshold, without any consistent gains in complexity or quality, but adding time resistance to the qualities required from viewers and justifying to some extent the additional ticket prices. 'Lucy' is only 85 minutes long credits included and this may be one of the reasons it feels like hurried and superficial, with the main ideas exposed like in a crash sciences lesson and all the characters with the exception of the main hero reduced to uni-dimensional sketches, without any character development. It's just a pity to see the talent of such fine actors like Morgan Freeman or Amr Waked wasted in such a way. The becoming of a genius and superhuman is described in a manner that is neither too original, nor too spectacular, and the smart dialogs between the beauty who became a genius and the scientist whose role seems mostly to be amazed without being able to help are just deprived of any emotion. There is one sentence about losing the capability to feel which if developed could have added a very different dimension to the film, but it was lost in the rush. When time becomes a dimension to be transgressed the journey looks more like an adult version of the 'Night at the Museum' which may run in the neighboring cinema hall. And that cinematographic metaphor reminding a famous ceiling painting? is it parody? 'Lucy' has many good premises and wastes most of them.",5,0,2,4 January 2015
Amélie," An American Import That Works
","It is usually the American studios taking over European movies and themes for remake. This film goes the opposite way. All the theme and environment is very much like 'American Beauty' or 'The Best You Can Get'. An innocent introspected waitress becomes the blessed angel for the lives of people around, and all goes as in Hollywood until she meets her destined half. Then, can she help herself and fix her own destiny? The stuff works amazingly, the combination of American plot and technique with the Paris chic, and French characters creates the ground for good acting and enjoyable cinematography. You will hardly forget the superb eyes of the main character. I enjoyed this movie!",10,0,1,8 June 2002

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I met the Force (again)
","Am I the only one believing that the peak of the career of J.J. Abrams as director and producer was (up to now at least) 'Lost' - the captivating series which dominated the TV screens in the second half of the previous decade? A couple of things are obvious beyond any doubt. Abrams is a passionate of science-fiction, and he has Gargantuan ambitions as he tries to make his mark on many of the major brands of the genre (and some of its action spins) from the MI series, then in Star Trek ( with the 2013 Star Trek Into Darkness) and now with the film that starts the last series in the Star Wars trilogy of trilogies - Star Wars: The Force Awakens. He did not convince me yet on the big screen that he is the same original thrilling creator that made of 'Lost' the series that made people change their weekly schedules even in the era of Internet availability of everything, but he certainly succeeded commercially and this film is 'in danger' of becoming the best cash machine in the history of the movies industry, displacing another film which was not IMO a masterpiece either - James Cameron's 'Avatar'.It's fun to watch the reactions as well. The enthusiastic fans who rushed to see the movie in the first hours after its premiere or in the first weekend the latest granted it a 8.8 average grade on IMDb. It will go down and I doubt that it will stay in the Top 250 (it's now in the 22nd place). Some other mourn the new series and its success and prompt it as an example of the decay of the 7th art into an industry of mass consumption. The reality is IMO someplace in the middle. 'Star Wars' belongs before all to the fairy tales cycle. Even the science-fiction and action labels apply only second, and you can enjoy them fully as a viewer only if you accept the fact that you are watching a film with emperors and princesses, with monsters and talking toys and animals who happily live, fight, love and die together. Seen from this perspective 'The Force Awakens' is a continuation of the series created by George Lucas , re-using and expanding its mythology, bringing back characters that we knew at younger ages, quoting from the precedent series. Its line of action is not very original and different from the one in the other series, but the demarcation between good and bad is the same, with the ambiguity of the two facets of the Force still being the principal philosophical line along which all the laser swords are fought and space-ships chase are run. As this is the first series in more than two decades that advances in time we are introduced to the new generation of Star Warriors which I guess will become dominant and will fight the final battles in the two series that are expected to premiere in 2017 and 2019.J.J. Abrams has done a more than decent work, quite respectful towards the original series, especially the first films. There are no spectacular innovations in this film, the graphics and the visual feeling is very similar to the first movies. Some of the characters return and seeing again Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is a true delight filled with melancholia. The new generation offers some interesting acting proposals, with Daisy Ridley on the side of Good as a Hunger Games-like young lead (who I suspect has some royal blood - to be discovered in the coming installments, the original ones had a similar secret), and Adam Driver playing the lead role on the dark side. There is a new robot in town as well, his name is BB-8, and an interesting future waits for him as for his human colleagues. Even R2-D2 makes a come back, and so does the Furry One. The 'new blood' and the action pace that can satisfy even fans of 'Fast and Furious' are good reasons to like this film. Again, however, the entry condition is to accept the convention. If you do not like the genre, it's not 'The Force Awakens' that will convince you to become a fan.",7,6,18,21 December 2015
RED," when actors retire
","When actors who played spies in action movies get older they have an option. They can start playing roles of retired spies in action movies. At least the best and the luckiest of them. Same is true for westerns or for science-fiction movies, BTW.Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman are all among the good and lucky one. Some of them may have not even crossed the legal age of retirement in these times when the governments push the pensions limit higher for reasons I would not detail here. What counts is that all the members of this 'carre of aces' are in good shape and have fun making us have fun in this story where the renegade and rogue agents are the active ones the the institution one should trust less than any other around is the government. Conspiracy is not a theory, it's a fact of life whose credibility is not placed under question for one second in the script of the film directed by Robert Schwentke. who film after film builds to himself a name of one of the best action film directors in Hollywood and I expect him being trusted with one of more of the never-ending James Bond series entries sometimes in the future.Did I forget somebody? Oh, yes - I should mention Richard Dreyfuss, one of the actors I mostly admired about three decades ago and who seemed to get lost into politics, to the point that I almost did not recognize him here in the retired villain role (sure, villains also retire). One could comment that only Willis is within his usual casting limits, while actors like Malkovich, Mirren, Freeman, or Dreyfuss could do more interesting things and certainly no Oscar was waiting for them behind the corner for the roles in RED, but, hey, this is entertainment, this is an action comedy, one of the genres Hollywood knows how to do well, the guys and the gal are having fun doing it, so get your popcorn and have some fun yourselves watching it.",7,2,3,24 December 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," the magic ends
","I am no big fan of Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling's novels are a combination of two literary genres that I am not fond off – the teenager adventures which I somehow left behind after reading Jules Verne when I was a teenager myself and the magic adventures stories which never really charmed me. Blame my scientific formation.Not having read any of the books I had to watch the films to get an idea what Harry Potter is about, and here again I did not fall in love. I liked the characters at many moments but I was not fascinated by them. The permanent gallery of good and bad witches with professorial robes fighting each other until and sometimes beyond death ended by confusing me and I stopped watching them carefully from a point on. If there is something that I really liked those were the computerized characters that seem to be benevolent, yet very ugly and very funny at the same time. Do not ask me their names.And now the end came. In two series spread over two years. I have seen them both in one evening, five hours of magic cinema thanks to the Jewish holidays. Again I could not help but admiring the impeccable camera work, the endless imaginary of the settings with a cool look, cool as they look very good and cool as in frozen as most of the action happens in winter. I also sensed the much darker treatment of the characters, after all round-spectacled kids grow up into round-spectacled teenagers and young men with a different problems, and of course little cued girls grow up into cued young women, and the process can be painful, as we know from our own experiences, or some of us even as parents. The good performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson made me by the end care about this gang.I less cared about the apocalyptic battles in this last film in the series, and not even Ralph Fiennes' performance as the super bad guy could convince me that the end can be anything else but the sympathetic heroes wining the war and living happily together in one combination or another. The tendency of the big series from the TV 'Lost' to 'The Lord of the Rings' and now Harry Potter to fight the end of world again each time becomes a little obsessional. The spectacular effects may be the ones attracting the audiences in the cinema theaters, they are not what the viewers remain with a day, a month, a year or a decade after they saw the film. It's the round spectacles and the first exchange of looks between a boy and a girl (be they magician apprentices) that will survive better.",8,0,1,4 October 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Almost a masterpiece
","LOTR-3 is probably the most astonishing achievement in computerized effects in film history - a masterpiece in this field, and it will stay so for a long time. I is a great piece of visual arts, and a good film in many other respects - well acted and directed, complex plot, with many interesting threads. However, in my opinion it fails to be the masterpiece that some viewers see in it. For the many of us who did not read the book the plot is still not very much more than a legend, which fails to bear too deep meanings. And although the last series is a little bit more human and touching than the previous ones, many of the characters are still one-dimensional. The biggest failure is however the ending - very long and redundant. If the film ended 20 minutes earlier, it would have been better.
Nevertheless, these minus points are small compared to the high level of the camera work, visual and sound effects and production. It is probably the best film of the year, and it gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",9,0,0,25 December 2003
Munich," a low for Spielberg
","I love Spielberg and much of his work. I first loved 'Duel' a minimalistic piece of horror in the early 70s, then he created a genre in 'Jaws', and he brought charm and sensibility in the alien stories in 'E.T.' and 'Encounter'. Later he tried to broaden his themes with 'Schindler's List' and 'Ryan' which were not masterpieces, because of the limits of Hollywood cinema approach, but yet were good films. I am afraid 'Munich' is a low.The Israeli TV made a few series about the life and moral dilemmas of Israelis that have to fight terrorism and defend their country by using non-conventional means. I am sorry to say, but these movies realized from the Israeli perspective with tools of tele-novellas are better and more true than this movie. Moreover, a bunch of Palestinian and Israeli movies recently were much better in catching the roots of the Middle East conflict and the psychology of its players.Much was written about the lack of authenticity in 'Munich' in re-creating the Israeli and Palestinian characters, or the numerous location mistakes. I was not that much disturbed about these aspects, but much more concerned about the lack of artistic truth. Palestinian and Isralis in the film behave in schematic way, they are represented through the stereotype view of a person remote to the conflict. The moral dilemma facing the Mossad agents is falsely represented and badly timed. The dialog in in Athens between the Israeli and the PLO agents which could have been a rare opportunity of truth is missed completely and turned into some kind of TV-like debate. At best the film looks like a routine international thriller, at worst it is close to the ridicule, when it tries to fake 'deepness' in rendering the nightmare of the terrorist acts in badly staged black&white flashbacks, or the sex scenes which try to be maybe some way for the main character to consume his anger or doubts, but look just grotesque.I hope Spielberg will overcome this low in his career, and get back to themes that he has better chances to understand or he dedicates more time and passion to really understand the issues at stake. Frankly, I miss a good dinosaurs movie.",5,2,7,24 June 2006
Looper," an intelligent sci-fi thriller
","Once the future was projected in movies as a colorful and peaceful environment, where most of the human challenges will come from encounters with other civilizations and the confrontation with humanity's own thirst in discovering the Universe and breaking all its frontiers. Then dark political fiction interfered, as movies like '1984′ and 'Brazil' brought up to screen the social nightmares of a world dominated by totalitarianism. Nowadays almost all movies that deal with the future seem to be dark dystopias that describe the planet after some kind of atomic, biological or ecological apocalypse, or in the best case populated by a society that resembles some kind of Orwellian nightmare. Director Rian Johnson's 'Looper' is no exception, as the world of 2044 or 2074 in the film is dominated by violence, human life has lower price than ever, and the technology progress did not bring to mankind any happiness (neither cleaner streets). Time travel was invented but quickly forbidden, as organized crime took over, and as with any forbidden substance or weapon it is the mafia that controls the illegal trade.'Loopers' are paid killers whose mission is to execute in cold blood in the year 2044 the victims targeted by the mob of 2074 to die. The trick and the trigger of the story is that 30 years later it may be decided that the looper is the one to die, and then if the sentence is not put in action a loop is created. Loopers are not allowed to feel any mercy, not even to their own self in the future. The smart script of this film, one of the smartest that I have seen lately avoids with the twist of a sentence the hard questions asked when the two instances of the same paid killer (Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) meet in one of the scenes that is hard to forget for anybody who saw the film. 'Too complicated, let us not enter the details'. And if details are left apart, this story works perfectly, and the ending makes a lot of sense in a story which could easily get too complicated and too hard to follow.It's hard to tell from this film that writer and director Rian Johnson is almost a newcomer in the world of Hollywood. Not only the pace of the film is perfectly tuned accelerating and slowing as the story demands, and the cinematography choices he made seem efficient and the story and dialogs create the atmosphere of distrust that lets the viewer ask all the time what is meant by the sequence he watches and what comes next, without explaining things too early or too late – there is also something in the realistic style he picks that makes the story credible and the characters resonate with viewers despite the unusual situations they are facing. Bruce Willis proves again that he is much more than an action hero actor (although the fans of Die Hard will find here a few scenes that will remind them their beloved character), Joseph Gordon-Levitt approaches the role with a self-confidence and a palette of nuances that makes me believe that we may have in him another megastar of tomorrow, while Emily Blunt confirms the good vibrations I felt watching her in 'The Adjustment Bureau'. 'Looper' is a more than satisfying action thriller, it's one of the best written, acted and directed films I have seen in the last year.",8,1,2,26 January 2013
Life," 'If All Goes Wrong'
","The once very popular Murphy's Law was stating 'Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.' The practical application of the saying into the space horror genre seems to be director Daniel Espinosa's Life. What if the worst assumptions and the deepest fears related to the long expected contact with alien life become true? This seems to be the premises of the film, coupled with an execution which salutes famous predecessors like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Alien, but does it in a different dosage of the components adding a few of its own to be satisfying, interesting and thrilling.The rules of fantastic fiction are well respected here as all starts in the familiar and thought-comfortable atmosphere of the space expedition returning from Mars and bringing back the first proof of alien life. Times Square fills with enthusiastic viewers of the life broadcast from the international space station where science mixes with trivia about food entering and exiting human body in no gravity conditions, and school kids give a household name ('Kevin') to the new form of life. It just happens that this very smart alien cell has the power to turn in a few minutes of screen time into a killing machine that will start devouring the crew whose mission of ensuring protection of Earth and life on the planet is in jeopardy, and gets suddenly much serious consequences.For a serious science-fiction movie the script has huge holes and abounds in science gaffs, but this becomes secondary because of the good characters development. Quite unusual in the genre, we get to know the six astronauts, and when they start dying heroic but horrible deaths we already know and feel something for them. Good actors performance helps, with Jake Gyllenhaal excelling in his 'guy-we-care-about' routine. The sets also try something different, this space station has a lot of tubular corridors where the lack of gravity is induced to viewers by using camera position effects and the colors palette looks like the (dark) negative of the cool non-colors in Kubrick's film. I will not say more about the ending then stating that this was one of the most unexpected and unsettling movie ends that I have seen lately. One more good reason not to miss this film, especially if you like science-fiction and horror.",7,2,7,6 April 2017
What We Do in the Shadows," I survived the night
","I love comedies in general and parodies in particular, but I'm not a big fan of vampires movies. But what about the parody of a vampires movie? I chose to watch 'What We Do in the Shadows', mainly because the film is written and directed by Taika Waititi - one of the hottest names on the movie market today, the author of 'Jojo Rabbit' - here alongside Jemaine Clement. The two also play two of the roles within the vampire quartet who spend a portion of eternity in a haunted house in the city of Wellington of our days. In fact better said the Wellington of our nights, because the active life of the vampires begins, as we all know, at nightfall, when they can go out without fear to lure and hunt their victims and meet with others creatures of darkness, for example with werewolves. I am not sorry about the time invested, I survived in one piece and with no bites the experience, and also without becoming a vampire or a fan of vampire movies.The format used by the filmmakers is that of a parody of documentary films, a format sometimes called 'mockumentary'. A film crew (whose protection is provided by contract) is sent to film kind of a 'reality show' that presents 'around the clock' the after-death adventures of the New Zealand's vampire inhabitants. As in any movie or TV show of the genre, there are alternated live footage (most filmed at night, some even in the dark) with biographical notes and off-action comments of the vampire protagonists. The formula, once understood by the spectators, allows for the continuous unfolding of jokes and orgy drunkenness with blood, of the comic and horror sequences, sometimes interleaved, other times combined. A considerable dose of ketchup and other red liquids finds plenty usage throughout the film.The schema works very well. The effect I think depends on the viewers' adherence to the parodied genre and the familiarity with the comic characters transferred into the vampire space. I believe that fans of the genre will find many familiar references, and for them the jokes will more easily reach their targets. Viewers who know the team of actors and directors will find familiar characters in new situations. For the less initiated viewers - myself among them - the result is partial. I smiled pretty much all the time and laughed moderately at many moments, but I didn't roll on the floor with laughs, as at the most successful comedies. Something in the style with which Taika Waititi addresses elements of popular culture is also felt in this film. He does not avoid the kitsch, I can even say that he is looking for it, but under his guidance parody loses any nuances of vulgarity. Unlike in 'Jojo Rabbit', in 'What We Do in the Shadows' fun is more important than the message. And that's OK. A recent news item names the New Zealand director as the author of a future series in the 'Star Wars' cycle. Now I have become curious!",6,2,4,18 January 2020
Cloud Atlas," past, present, future
","'Cloud Atlas' is one of those films that challenges critics and movie lovers by refusing categorizations. Historical fresco? Philosophical film? Science fiction? Art movie? Mega-production with mega-stars in distribution? 'Cloud Atlas', made in 2012 by The Wachowskis and the formidable German director Tom Tykwer, can be considered as having elements of all these genres, and at the same time belonging to a separate category. It is a spectacular and sophisticated film, which leaves many elements of the story and interpretation in the hands and minds of the spectators, and a captivating movie because of the way it is made, realized and interpreted. At the end of the viewing I was left with the feeling that many details and meanings remained open or unexplored, but at the same time I did not go through any boredom moments, on the contrary, I was permanently captivated, despite the duration of almost three hours. It's one of the few movies I'd like to see again. It happens very rarely to me, even with the films that I really loved.
'Cloud Atlas' is the screen adaptation of a novel by the same name written by David Mitchell, built as a succession of six stories, which take place over different periods of time, and which are linked by a similar theme and by the fact that in each of them there are references to the previous story. The structure of the novel is pyramidal, the stories unfold in the first part of the book chronologically, the final one in the middle, and then the narratives come back in time in reverse sequence. The filmmakers chose to present the six plots in parallel and interleaved. The film permanently alternates scenes in which the narrative threads intersect: from the story of a ship sailing the ocean in the 19th century during the slave trade period, passing through the 1930s story of the young genius composer of the symphonic piece 'Cloud Atlas', the one of the brave reporter involved in a political investigation in the 1970s, of the publisher pursued by literate gangsters in the contemporaneity, until the two episodes in the future, involving a revolt of humanoid robots and a story of contact between civilizations. There are some shared ideas - especially the uniqueness of truth and its supreme moral value, but the style of each episode is distinct, from the historical film, via political thrillers, to sci-fi. Three of the episodes are directed by The Wachowskis, the other three by Tykwer. Their combining is superb, creating a sense of continuity and sublimating the idea of temporal relativity and fluidity. One door closes in one time period and opens in another. The paces of the stories accelerate or stop simultaneously, the moments of maximum tension are reached in simultaneity. As in a wonderful mosaic where you step back a few steps and you see the whole, same in 'Cloud Atlas' the sensations of continuity and consistency are perfect.
The unity of ideas and style of the film is strengthened by the casting in different episodes of a remarkable team of actors, many of whom play multiple role roles that transcend not only time, but also ages, sex, skin color. The exceptional makeup also contributes to the melting of actors with such well-known faces as Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, or Susan Sarandon in their characters. Also appearing in the film is Doona Bae, a famous South Korean actress (I had seen her in 'A Girl at My Door') but little known outside her country. Another special component of connection and expression is the film's soundtrack. I believe that for those who are not afraid of cinematic experiences other than the routine ones, and who do not necessarily look for a particular genre in its purest state, 'Cloud Atlas' is a film that offers many reasons for satisfaction. It is also a film that I think by its very structure is destined to withstand time, and to be increasingly appreciated in the future.",9,2,5,19 February 2020
300," ridiculous as cinema
","'300' can be located in the antiquity historical films genre that gave a few very good movies, just to mention 'Gladiator' and the TV series 'Rome'from the later success stories. Films in this genre usually succeed when they are true to the spirit of the times and the human dimension of the heroes and fail when they try to make a point and send messages that fit our times rather than the past. '300' makes all the possible mistakes already made in the bad category genre plus a few new ones.The story of the battle at Thermopylae where the 300 Spartans faced the mighty army of the evil empire of those times is told in a bombastic manner, with off screen commentaries and heroes tirades that sound more fit to the parliaments nowadays. It would be an insult to the comics books to say that the characters have the depth of comics books characters. The whole representation of the different nations in conflict is full of stereotypes, and does not seem to care too much about historical details.The only good parts in the film are some of the visuals, but even here what I read about the techniques used or invented to make this movie was more efficient than what I could see on the screen, maybe also because a wrong choice of the palette of colors that makes the landscape look in many occasions like some old-fashioned studio setting from the 50s - exactly what the creators of the effects intended to avoid. The fight scenes are fine, but fight scenes do not make a whole movie nowadays. As cinema '300' is a complete failure.",3,2,3,17 August 2007
Ran," Kurosawa's Last Masterpiece
","This is an amazing film, the last masterpiece of one of the greatest directors of the 20th century. Kurosawa was a master of cross-cultural fusion, he started by doing very Japanese music that were re-made by the Western creators, then he took some of the great writers and playwrights themes and gave them a Japanese adaptation. 'Ran' (Chaos) is a perfect blend of the Shakespearean 'King Lear' with the Japanese samurai legends. It is both classical and Japanese, it is universal.The film is of a visual beauty and complexity that words can hardly describe. Action scenes, costumes and the color palette are worked finely to the latest detail. The text has poetical beauty and moral strength and tells a world about wisdom and insanity, getting old and loving one's children, about death, love and treason, and above all about human madness. This is a creation not to be missed.",10,2,5,1 September 2007
Green Book," music, friendship and prejudice
","'Green Book' seems to have been designed according to a recipe for winning Academy Awards. The subject is historic but with reverberations in current politics and the approach is in tune with the mood at Hollywood. It addresses one of the painful topics of recent US history, but it does it in a sufficiently careful manner to get a rating that makes it accessible to audiences of almost any age. It has as a hero a musician and includes a lot of (good) music at a time when musical films are again enjoying great success. The cast includes a couple of well known actors who are given the opportunity to play consistent roles. Finally, the film is based on real life heroes and a true story. And yet, despite all these arguments, I do not think the 'Green Book' will be able to gather too many statuettes.The story of the friendship between the high-class musician and the driver he hired for a two-month tour of the Southeast US of the 1960s is unusual. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) was an exceptional musical personality, one of the virtuoso pianists of his generation, but he could not get recognition into the world of classical music because of his Jamaican origin. He played a brand of sophisticated jazz for rich audiences. Yet, the rich musician, accustomed to first class hotels, when in tournaments in the southern states, as a black singer, he was subjected to racial discrimination in the still partially segregated America. Don 'Lip' (Viggo Mortensen), the driver and bodyguard hired to accompany him on the trip is an Italian from the Bronx, not missing a dose of benign racism. A lot seems to separate them, but the differences in race, culture, social classes and personal tastes will be tested and will melt during this road trip together that allows the two to get to know each other and to learn each some lessons from the experience of the other.What I liked. The music. The authenticity of the details. The acting performances of the two lead actors, but also of many of the ones in supporting roles, including the non-professionals. The way in which the realities of the 1960s are brought to screen.What I liked less. The predictability of the script. I was several times in the situation of anticipating a few minutes in advance what was going to happen on screen. The director and co-screenwriter Peter Farrelly went too far to make of 'Green Book' a feel-good film to be enjoyed by the audiences and especially by the jury of the Academy. The result, even if it has the excuse of being inspired by a true story, is conventional and syrupy. I think this movie could have been much better if it did not try that hard to be a crowd-pleaser.",7,1,2,19 February 2019
Jackie Brown," the less Tarantinesque of Tarantino's movies
","Somehow I missed 'Jackie Brown' - a Tarantino movie made in 1997 which takes in his directing career a chronological place between 'Pulp Fiction' and the two 'Kill Bill' movies. It is to some extent the less Tarantinesque of the Tarantino movies - 150 minutes of solid film making, a violent gangster movie very much in tone with the 90s, but lacking the excesses and the sarcasm of his greatest films. I am sure though that many other folks will consider it the best or one of the best films in his career, exactly for the same reasons I did not like it completely. Great acting by Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda and Palm Grier. Excellent soul music soundtrack - Tarantino's mobsters have a special taste for music, did you notice?",8,0,1,24 July 2013
Sin City," visually amazing, tough and original
","'Sin City' is not a good proposition for folks who dislike violence on screen. Tarantino contributed to this film much more than by directing one scene and having his name recorded on the screen as co-director. In fact 'Sin City' is a direct descendant of the popular culture trend open by 'Pulp Fiction' and the style reminds and gets closer in some moments to 'Kill Bill'. Rober Rodriguez may be the director, but the spirit of Tarantino co-directs all along the way.'Sin City' takes the comics inspired movie a step ahead by taking the graphics of the two-colored comics books and translating them into scree visuals. The result is amazing. It also takes the comics characters and puts them on screen, as comics characters are - sketchy and bi-dimensional, forms without soul, with no pretension of character building or evolution. There is no psychological depth in a two-dimensional cartoon.Folks may argue about the amount of violence of all kinds, and question if they are really needed. Well, there are different categories of comics, 'Sin City' tends to be in the rated category, and this is what the film director decided to do. Acting is actually here entering the cartoon character skin, and amazingly the only weaker performance seemed to me to be the one given by Willis, who tried to be more human than necessary.Yes, of course, 'Sin City 2' is in the making, and there is talk about the third one.",8,0,2,24 October 2005
Gangs of New York," Strong and Entertaining
","Martin Scorsese's movie is close to the best American commercial cinema can get. I do not know to what extent the events described in the movie are true, but they come really alive on the screen. A whole world is brought to our eyes - powerful, violent, colorful and you can really philosophize and say that you understand where the violent power and fascination of today's New York come from. This world seems to come directly from the books of Dickens or Hugo. If the American literature did not have a novel writer of that stature to describe the 19th century society, here comes Scorsese, and re-creates that world one and a half century later on a different media.I am no fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but he is at his best in this film. Daniel De Lewis has already an Oscar on his shelves, and would have deserved a second one for his creation in this movie. There are a lot of other well acted strong characters in this film, and you can feel the hand of the master in directing the actors, as well as in the camera work. One may say that violence is not always justified by logic but by artistic needs, but these were the times, and there are a few memorable scenes to pay back for this. 9/10 on my personal scale for this strong and entertaining film.",9,1,2,14 December 2003
Spectre," 007 - overcome by events
","Action films have a problem this fall. The reality of the crazy world we live in is not only rapidly closing in the horrors and destruction imagined by script authors, but it is overcoming it also at some moments. 'Spectre' the 2015 edition of the adventures of Agent 007 has a number of TV screens that bring to the world TV audiences information about terror attacks taking place in locations like Mexico City, London or Capetown. Unfortunately they do not look much mode dramatic than what we have lately seen on the news about Paris.So what is left for Agent 007 in a film set (or at least made) in 2015 at the time the news on TV screen compete and overcome the horrors imagined by Fleming and his followers? Director Sam Mendes brings into the story some of the recurring themes from 'Skyfall' as well as a number of characters from the new generation of Bond's companions. Ralph Fiennes is already comfortable in the role played in many episodes by Judy Dench, and the next generation of Q (Ben Whishaw) and Miss Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) start to gain an air of familiarity. Daniel Craig continues to divide the fan base, bu then, was not this always the case with all Bonds since Sean Connery left the role of the Eyebrowed One? Action is more than reasonable, it is actually quite good in 'Spectre' but this is not something we should be surprised in a Bond movie. The only surprise is actually the lack of surprises.With the new team taking control with good action, with a Bond widow (Monica Bellucci) worth every second (there are not too many) spent on screen and a Bond girl (Léa Seydoux) who seems here to stay at least for one more film why do I feel still so much missing in the new Bond? One of the reasons may be that the bad guys do not look so bad. It is not that Christoph Waltz is a bad actor, but we do know that in 2015 most of the bad guys have very different ideologies than the politically-correct one brought on screen by 'Spectre'. Old secret services configurations are outdated, and even the evil state surveillance does not seem too high a price to pay in a world dominated by terrorism. The no. 1 enemy of the new Bond film seems to be again reality.",7,0,2,26 November 2015
True Romance," the best Tarantino movie not made by Tarantino
","I believe that there is such a genre called 'the Tarantino movies'. They have a story which is usually a gangster story, but not necessarily. Men in the story are teenagers or they all have teenagers minds, they are addicted to comics and pulp fiction, they love cinema if cinema was invented when the action takes place, there must be a scene in a cinema theater or at least in front of a TV set in these films. Girls are gorgeous and hookers. Morality plays an important role, but is of a special kind. There is a lot of violence in this films, so well filmed that viewers know it's not true and they have fun watching it. Martial arts are the real art.Some of the Tarantino films are made by Quentin Tarantino. Some other not. 'True Romance' is not, but it's written by Tarantino, it was made 20 years ago but looks as fresh as if it was made yesterday, which shows that the genre beyond other qualities also has the one of aging nicely. It's a gangster story, it's a love story, it's a crime comedy about a young couple semi-willingly becoming murderers and unwillingly becoming drug dealers, it's a road movie, it's a movie about Hollywood. And it's fun to watch.There are so many good things in this film that I have a hard time picking which one to list. Dialogs and the musical score (Hans Zimmer - see the list of the films he composed for at IMDb and you will understand why you loved even more some of the best films in Hollywood in the last 30 years) are exquisite. Acting is stellar with the lead exception of Christian Slater which I simply cannot force myself to like. Lucky me, he is paired in the film with Patricia Arquette, and then we have Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walke, Gary Oldman ... wow ... each of them in supporting roles hard to forget.The director of this film is Tony Scott, who died last year. He was among these directors who would never get an Oscar because he just made the films that pleased the crowds. 'True Romance' is however much more than a crowd-pleaser, it may be T.Scott's best and one of the best Tarantino films ever made.",9,0,2,14 June 2013
Her," 'my sweet OS'
","I have no luck this year with the films that are favorites in the race for the Academy Awards. Or maybe they do not do well with me. I liked almost none of the ones I've seen so far and I found myself disagreeing pretty much with the audiences and the critics. That was the case with ' Gravity ' with Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock, so it is with 'Her' made by Spike Jonze, a director of ambitious projects and always interesting to watch . From this point of view I appreciated the movie, I like movies that try to send a message and say things in a different way. Jonze managed to do this with 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, failed with 'Adaptation' in 2002, and fails here again IMO, although as I said others differ. At least he does not fail for not trying.The story takes place in Los Angeles sometime in the not too distant future. As all social conflicts were resolved people seem to have enough time to take care of themselves. The film heroes are not significantly different than the New York yuppies of our time - they are prone to introspection and melodrama , and feel miserable and self- compassionate in breakups . The main character of the film named Theodore (played by the wonderful Joaquin Phoenix holds a job of the future - composing handwritten love letters, of course with the help of computers. Each of the characters , each of the figures that appear on the screen even for a fraction of a second holds in its hand, pocket, or ear the devices which connect them to applications and operating systems . It is a world in which the descendants of the iPhones and the natural extensions of Facebookj have become the physical and intellectual extensions of humans.But what about human feelings? The main plot of the film begins to unfold when Theodore buys a new operating system for his computers and appliances. Simply called OS / 1 it has not only a phenomenal capacity calculation and a female voice belonging to no other than Scarlett Johansson , It is actually a She. She also has the capability to self-learn, to continuously improve her know-how and ,ake the best decisions for the good of its users.When Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson are together on screen even if she is only present with her voice, when he is struggling with loneliness in the final stages of a divorce , and she in turn is un-experienced in the facts of life, but willing and able to learn more and do everything for him, Hollywood logic requires them to fall in love , and it does not matter that she is nothing but a sublime collection of algorithms - she acquires the ability to feel and to love. Love is beyond physical connection , that much we know. What the film tries to say is that no matter what we are, no matter how and where we are, as long as there is a feeling there can be love.I will let you discover how the story ends after watching the movie. Many of the film's fans were convinced. Some other like me less. A few left the hall before getting to see half of it . One of the difficulties viewing is related to accepting the film convention. Computers have a soul? It's a question that was already asked by science-fiction writers since Isaac Asimov, or by Kubrik in '2001 - A Space Odyssey ' one of the masterpieces of the genre. Who does not accept the existence of the soul and love beyond strictly human context will have a problem with watching this film which takes the premise very seriously. Otherwise, for these who have a hard time accepting the convention, about half of the film may seem ridiculous, because it is composed of dialogs between Theodore and Samantha (yes, that's her name on the incarnation of OS / 1 ), that is of Phoenix and a voice from the off. Remember how you find those who spoke on the speaker phones in cars stopped at traffic lights until you are used to the fact that it is not a crazy person talking to himself in the car ? It is not with the convention that I had trouble watching this movie but with simplistic sentimentality of the plot . What we really have here? A lonely man meets a smart girl , beautiful , and yet inexperienced in life. Together learn to know one another , she learns to express her feelings, she discover him and she understand him, she learns to love and to make love. But there many reasons that men do not understand because of which she cannot only be his. After I accepted effects and was able to disregard them (that is what the director wanted me as a spectator!) I was left with an ordinary and melodramatic romance. And the fact that I know something about the technology behind the film did not help at all in making more interesting. On the contrary .The basic premise of the film that thinking machines would be capable of feelings, through a simple extension of artificial intelligence algorithms is in my opinion flown. Feelings are not just an extension of human logic, and love can not get perfecting algorithms, adding memory, and increasing speed Internet access.",6,0,3,12 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," powerful social melodrama
","I confess that I have too little knowledge about the genuine Indian cinema, and I need to rely on films like this one to understand the culture and the people of the country. Danny Boyle's surprising Oscar blockbuster is a strong and colorful explosion of images of different segments of the Indian society, from the lowest unlucky kids in the slums, born to violence and abuse to the gangsters and nouveaux riches privileged of the developing India of today. Kids abuse, crime, poverty, religious and ethnic tensions, the old and the new India all get their place on screen, and the viewer can feel the rhythms and the immense power of this country even if he never visited it.The structure of the story is inspired by the trivia 'Millionaire' TV show, the main hero being a semi-an-alphabet tea boy in Mumbay who reaches to the almost final win stage raising the suspicions of the police. Under a harsh interrogation he starts revealing the secret of his matching answers - all questions relate one way or another with experiences of his life. It's a little bit like the Forrest Gump hero connected to all important events of the American history of the second half of the 20th century. Here it is his own life, a life of violence and tragedy that seems to fit with the show questions and provide him all answers. One can interpret this as a fine saying about the relationship between popular television and life, but this is not the focus of the film. The biography of the superbly acted hero feeds the colorful and realistic rendition of the Indian landscape presented through the eyes of kids unhappy by birth and destiny and filmed with pace and non-hesitating realism, sustaining the interest for most of the film.It is the final part that changes the tone and turns the movie into melodrama and romantic story. I have mixed feelings about this change of tone, including the finale which makes a deep reverence to the Bollywood style. On one hand the director seems to give up to the cruel and dark vision that dominates the first part of the film. He seems to have feared that if the register stayed there we would have got 'just' a strong and violent social drama, lacking too much the human dimension. With the romantic component controlling the final part of the film the whole message looks different, the film is closer to popular entertainment, and even the TV trivia game ends by being seen from a different perspective. The success of the film is no doubt due to this change of register in the final quarter of the screening time. Maybe all successful films (and certainly these who aim to wining Oscar awards) need a certain dose of melodrama. Due to this final the film achieved success, but I am not convinced that it really got better.",8,1,3,22 May 2009
The Bourne Supremacy," better than James Bond?
","The Bourne series, now at the second install have the potential of becoming a rival of the James Bond series. They do belong to the same category of international spy stories, taking us in all kinds of urban and exotic jungles, they are written around a well defined character, they originate in a series of novels written by a master of the genre, and with the James Bond series losing steam lately - who knows? 'Bourne Supremacy' is not a masterpiece, but is one of the good action films of the summer. It has a good script, it is well acted and if you accept the rules and you are after action entertainment you do not need much more. Some of the viewers in IMDb criticized the camera work in the action scenes - I actually found it interesting with the subsecond takes more suggesting than describing what is going on. For me it is he changes in pace between these scenes and the more psychological long takes - especially the ones in Russia reminding the Russian cinema style that make the film look different.7/10 on my personal scale.",7,1,4,7 September 2004
Sully," Clint's Heroes A-changin'
","It's interesting to watch the evolution of the heroes that Clint Eastwood brought to screen in his acting and directing career. His first serious impact was with the spaghetti western style heroes of the 60s, followed by the sometimes rotten, sometimes idealistic cops in the action movies of the 70s. Later as he turned to directing and built a solid career as an accomplished director his heroes were polarized in super-achievers or rhetoric failures. Some of them continued to use their fists or guns. Other were inspiring leaders or great inspiring movers. They never were conventional. Which is the main problem with Sully. The hero of this film is so predictable. Even his dilemmas and the way they are solved are predictable.You will tell me that this is a true story, we know the ending, it happens to be a happy one, this also happens in life. Maybe so. Reality however does not always provide the best promises for great art, and realism is just one of the possible styles in cinema (and not necessarily the one I prefer). Good movies were made based on true stories and biographies of real heroes. They succeeded however because they could find new dimensions to the stories and the characters, not because they followed the beaten tracks. Even in Sully the best parts are the ones that describe, almost as against the story the conflict between self confidence and doubts. Should we trust the heroes that become overnight media sensations. The instinctual answer is 'no - be cautions' but this is not the obvious answer here. The problem is that the envelope is so conventional, full of platitudes and melodrama, of small and insignificant side threads (the calls with the wife) that add nothing to the substance of a story that is quite thin already.It is interesting as well to watch the evolution of the heroes that Tom Hanks acted on screen. If there is one thing that made his career exceptional it's the fact that he never made the expected, his next role was an exception, a different character that built himself as a live and true character on screen, no matter if he was playing a Central Asia refugee or an American astronaut. This is not the case here. If there is one performance that director Eastwood succeeded in this film, it was making actor Hanks look bored and boring for the first time in his career.'Landing on the Hudson - The Movie' (my personal title) is not the best film of either Clint Eastwood (as director) or Tom Hanks. It brings however some interesting questions about the careers of the two exceptional film personalities in the film industry and America of 2016.",6,0,0,29 December 2016
Valkyrie," it could have been a much better film
","The plot to kill Adolf Hitler put together in July 1944 by a group of military was the last in a series of attempts to kill the head of the Third Reich and save what could be saved of the German honor, and spare Germany the total defeat and unconditional surrender. This is one of the most fascinating and intriguing pages of the history of World War II and any film that is inspired by this action has interesting premises to base upon despite the fact that the end is known to everybody. The plot failed and the was continued for another ten months, Adolf Hitler committed suicide and escaped human justice, but not the justice of history.The man who led the plot and who had the courage to put a bomb in the meeting room where the commanders of the German army were gathered together with Adolf Hitler is one of the fascinating characters of history. He was a complex character, that his wife Nina von Stauffenberg who survived him for more than half a century described in the following words: He let things come to him, and then he made up his mind ... one of his characteristics was that he really enjoyed playing the devil's advocate. Conservatives were convinced that he was a ferocious Nazi, and ferocious Nazis were convinced he was an unreconstructed conservative. He was neither. Claus von Stauffenberg is the principal character in Valkyrie, the historic thriller directed by Bryan Singer. Tom Cruise could have been the ideal casting, even if he is about ten years older than the age of 37 that Stauffenberg had at the time of the events. He was not, as both director and lead actor seem to focus on the action side of the story, on the details of the plot that involved activating a program designed by Hitler himself that mobilized the reserve army in the eventuality of a successful plot to the life of the Fuhrer, and on the reasons - mostly of human nature and of hazard - that lead to the failure of the plot. The historic details are interesting, but the documentary quality is not enough to fully sustain a Hollywood production with stars of such quality, and too little of the human dimensions, dilemmas, fears of the plotters make it beyond the screen.'Valkyrie' could have been a much more interesting film, a drama focused on the tragic complicity of the German military class with the criminal Nazi regime and the choice that few of them made to become traitors to their country in order to save something of the honor of the nation. Instead of that we get a docu-drama made with the expensive means of the Hollywood studios, which bows respectfully to the plotters of July 1944, but fails to bring on screen their human and true historic dimensions.",5,0,1,9 October 2011
The Soloist," This is Called Grace
","One trick I truly dislike when a movie is promoted is when the label 'inspired by a true story' is placed into a too visible place, especially when it comes to true stories and to characters which I could in theory at least meet on the street (well, on some streets). I am confused by mix of documentary and drama that are not frankly labeled as such but prefer to disguise in fiction movies resorting the 'inspired by ' label only when in artistic or credibility trouble, and I do not buy easily the theories about life exceeding melodrama. After all what counts for me in a film is the artistic truth, and there is a credibility of emotions and situations that does not necessarily go at the same pace as plain reality. For plain reality I have the real life, and I have TV news, Internet and written press. I am looking for something else when I watch a fiction movie.One of the problems with The Soloist is that while director Joe Wright uses all the tools of the great studios films, the story does not gather neither enough 'meat' not enough 'steam' to sustain the whole film. The story of the Julliard drop-out who becomes a homeless to be accidentally discovered 30 years later by a LA Times reporter can make for a good article in the LA Times, or even a good series of articles or a book, but not for a whole film. One of the reasons is that the script writer does not seem to have fully investigated the case, or maybe decided not to bring the whole material to screen. I confess that I did not understand the reasons of Minnesota-born cellist Nathaniel Ayers leaving school – we have flashbacks that bring indications about childhood problems, some words about a big-handed father (maybe child abuse?), other flashbacks hint to racial pressure at Julliard or just the pressure any young artist experiences in such a competitive environment, and other words speak about his need for RESPECT – so what is the conclusion? The director does not let us know, or I did not get it.There are many artistic qualities in this film. First the superb acting of the two lead actors – Jamie Foxx is troubled and vulnerable and the efforts to break the wall of non-communication he built around himself make it to the viewer. Robert Downey Jr. provides the interior strength and the humanity to make us love his hero, and believe strongly that there must be a place for investigative journalism and its true heroes in our future lives. What causes The Soloist not to be the good film it aimed to become is the lack of decision in choosing the right tone while throwing away the overweight of moralization. While saying emphatically that it is based on the realities of our days, the film dares not adopt the documentary techniques, but emulates them using the traditional tools of Hollywood. It is just that good acting and splendid music are not enough in this case.",6,0,0,16 December 2012
Rock Star," good rock film
","WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!'Rock Star' is one of the solid rock movies I have ever seen. The original idea of the script focuses on a young singer in the 80s, leading a tribute band of one of the most famous hard rock bands of the period. He is not only playing their music to the note, but also living the life of his idols. When his friends  in the tribute band expel him, in search of some originality, the destiny plays him a good turn, and gets hired to replace the lead singer of the idols band.  A dream came true? Well, almost. While starting to live the life of the famous, including the drug and sex excesses of the rock scene of the 80s, he will also have to face the problems in relationship with his supportive girlfriend, and will be eventually need to answer questions about creativity and having a saying in the music of the band.
I liked the film, one of the reasons being that it is one of the first times that the life and music of the hard metal rock bands is shown in a realistic manner. Fans of the music genre will be satisfied by the soundtrack. The overall idea is original, and the issues of how an artist lives his life and creates his art are being rendered in a sensible and balanced manner. Acting is quite good, with Mark Wahlberg better than in most of the other action flics I saw him lately, and Jennifer Aniston in tune with the nice-girl-who-knows-a-lot-about-life role. More problematic is the ending, which  is quite conventional, and may disappoint.  It looks like the main character after quiting the big and famous band has found his own creative path. However, in an  ironical twist the music he is playing in the club at the end is the worst in the whole movie! 8/10 on my personal scale. Worth seeing - however, expect exposure to a high dose of metal. If you do not like this kind of music, you may chose to avoid this film.",8,7,12,27 June 2004
The Martian," techno-survival
","I expect something special when I go to a film by Ridley Scott . In his long and remarkable career Scott approached many genres from space horror to historical sagas, from road movies to gangster comedies and succeeded exceptionally well in many of these. The secret is of course professionalism, the talent to tell a story, and to build (sometimes) greater-than-life characters which are credible in extreme situations. He tried to do the same with 'The Martian' but in my opinion he did not succeed too much.Maybe the problem lies in trying to build too much on the combination of two successful genres - the sole survivor story and the big space drama. The second genre was pretty successful in the previous two Academy Awards seasons (with 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar') and Scott and his producers may aim for a similar fate for 'The Martian' - the saga of an astronaut believed dead and left behind on Mars, to be rescued in an extreme action of inter-planetary dimension. We'll see if he succeeds, but on my scale he rather failed.The sign of such a film not really succeeding is when the day or the days after you remember more the technical aspects. This exactly happens to me with this film. Planting potatoes on Martian soil and sealing a space vehicle with adhesive tape has some fun of itself, but it dangerously competes with the human dimension of the story, with the fight of the lonely astronaut to overcome the elements and his own despair. Matt Damon is a fine action movies lead actor but he's no Tom Hanks (not yet, at least) and his role here may not get him even an award nomination. This techno-survival story leans too much on the technology side.",6,2,6,29 December 2015
Law Abiding Citizen," how unfortunate lights need to be turned on at the end of the screening
","Here is the genre of action movie that catches you while you watch it, keeps you on the edge of the chair or sofa, but later, when lights are turned on again you start asking questions about credibility and authenticity not only of the action, but also of the characters and the meaning of what you have seen on screen.The first scenes of Law Abiding Citizen show the hero (played by Gerald Butler of king Leonidas fame in 300 in a very Russel Crowe style) talking with his young daughter while building some amateurish electronics (actually they should be very professional but we shall know this much later). Then hell breaks, bad guys break into the house, kill his daughter, kill and rape his wife. When the DA (Jammie Foxx) closes the deal with one of the murders to be the prosecution witness against the other, so that he gets a lighter punishment vs. death row, our hero gets angry. He actually gets more then angry, he becomes a psychopathic serial killer, who will kill one by one not only the perpetrators of the horrific crime that destroyed his life but also everybody who was involved in the deal. He actually will be more than just a serial killer, he will be a sophisticated serial killer, who is able to kill even while he finds himself in jail, even when he founds himself in seclusion. This we learn because his skills were not really amateurish, but rather the ones of a professional planner of murders. The criminals and the compromise-prone justice people had really chosen the wrong guy.Does the synopsis look like already-seen-hundred-times at best and stupid at worst? Yes, it does. The surprise is how well it works for the majority of the film duration. The merit belongs in my opinion to director F. Gary Gray whose previous best quoted films (The Negotiator, The Italian Job) were also in the thriller and action genres proving his mastering of the matter. Gray keeps the suspense at high most of the time, he succeeds to surprise the viewer several time with insertions of violence just when the apparent order seems to be re-established, but most than all he knows how to pick his actors. Gerald Butler is so credible that we end as viewers by empathizing with his hero much more than he deserves, but the real surprise is Colm Meaney a great TV actor that we know from scores of series, who gets here an opportunity to make it on the big screens and certainly deserves much more time on them.It's just after-screening logic that kills this film. But turning on the lights after the screening is unavoidable as we all know.",6,1,2,20 September 2010
Up in the Air," Thin Air
","I fail to get enthusiastic about 'Up in the Air'. It may be because corporate life is no strange thing to me, it may be because romantic comedies or professional dramas are not my piece of cake, it may be because I was starting to develop so high expectations about George Clooney that seeing a film where he is just good, and not better than in a previous one comes as a disappointment.Or maybe it is the subject. Firing people from their jobs ('terminating' them as the euphemism goes in this film) is no laughing matter and even if it was unavoidable that it becomes subject to a major movie some day, the intermingling of this theme with a few other (like life of the big corporate travelers addicted to their frequent fliers programs, or the romantic theme of the eternal bachelor facing mid-life crisis and catching the opportunity to make a change towards the conventional track) did not really work to me. The story of corporate job terminator Bingham (Clooney) facing the termination or at least radical change of his own job because of the appearance in his own company of rookie Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who tries to revolutionize the business endangering his jet style of life while his personal life seems to be at pick when he meets his female mirrored image in Alex (Vera Famiga) combines several conventional threads, and cannot make out of the combination an original movie.I do not have anything special to say about what director Jason Reitman does for most of the time - he does a fair job but having Clooney in the lead role is like coaching a soccer team with Messi in the opening squad. Actually Clooney although well cast does not do anything special, he just plays his own role - enough for a good performance, disappointing if we consider how well he changed skins in most of his films lately. Famiga is OK, and only Anna Kendrick succeeds to break the ranks and to bring to skin an emotional ingénue which crosses the screen in a sincere interpretation.The best part of the film are the one shot scenes of people being fired. It is here that Reitman had his touch of genius. He put an add in a St. Louis newspaper and gather real people who lost their jobs recently, and enacted their feelings and emotions in the moments when they received the hit for the camera. These are the moments when we feel the true life, these are the scenes when we can understand the dramas that take place at the personal level, part of the bigger picture drama of the economic crisis that engulfed America. This is actually the best cinema in this film, the rest is just Hollywood wrapping.",5,1,2,22 April 2010
Atonement," a story of love and betrayal in times of war
","The story of Joe Wright's film 'Atonement' starts as romantic and social drama in the setting of a 1930s high class mansion, very similar to the one of 'Easy Virtue'. The rich elder daughter of the owners of the estate Cecilia (Keira Knightley) falls in love with handsome and clever Robbie (James McAvoy) the son of the janitor and the two live a short and passionate affair which is brutally interrupted by Briony the young sister of Cecilia, a confused but imaginative teenager who misreads some of the scenes she is witnessing and sends to jail Robbie for a crime that he did not commit.The next part of the story happens in Europe at the start of the second world war. Robbie has won his way out of prison volunteering to serve as simple soldier in the army, and lives the tragedy of war and the days of the debacle of Dunquerque. His moral anchor is a short meeting he had with Cecilia and the hope to get back his love and life.In the third segment we meet again Briony, out of her troubled years, and starting to understand the evil she had made to her sister and her sister's lover. She renounced the easy life at the estate and studies at Cambridge, has volunteered as a nurse to do some good, and tries to contact her sister to get forgiveness and fix the evil she has done by recognizing that her accusations were false. But is atonement sufficient and can evil deeds be undone in real life? Or can imagination compensate for what destiny has decided to happen in real life? Is it actually destiny, or hazards and misunderstandings of real life that govern what happens? It is the final segment of the story that will provide answers. Briony becomes the real hero of the story, with her permanent alternation between imagination and reality, with her tentative to take responsibility and get absolution from deeds she committed long time ago but which need to be with her for the rest of her life. The final key scene gives a different perspective to the whole story and this is probably reflecting the structure of the narration in the original novel. There are two scenes of beautiful cinema in this film - the run in the forest in the first part of the film and the long shot scene on the beach of Dunquerque bringing to life the debacles of war - and the name of the director of cinematography Seamus McGarvey must be mentioned in this context. Out of a fine cast I liked most James McAvoy who brings to screen personality and charm to match the beauty and talent of Keira Knightley, and Vanessa Redgrave with a moving performance as old Briony, a role that fits her perfectly.I did not read Ian McEwan's book, but the quality and intensity of the story can be felt in the script of 'Atonement'. Director Joe Wright uses a couple of times an interesting technique of playing the same scenes from the perspective of different characters, emphasizing the role of perception (real or false) in the story. As a viewer I had the feeling that this time we may be in the case of an adaptation to screen that succeeds to be true to the spirit and quality of a good book.",8,1,2,30 May 2009
V for Vendetta," good cinema on a very problematic message
","'V for Vendetta' is one of the best comics-inspired movies ever made. It succeeds to bring to screen strong characters, yet it is faithful to its comics roots. It has a message, it sticks to it, and it transmits it in a efficient way to the viewer. However this message is disturbing and problematic.The story happens a few decades from now. The US do not exist any longer, and Britain fell under the grip of a fascist regime, evolved from a Tory party that went wild. One man fights the wrong, lonely but powerful as any of the king of Superman or Spiderman. His goal is no less than to overturn the political system and tumble back the balance of power in favor of the people. The problem is that the Wachovsky brothers (authors of the script) and director James McTeigue are too good in making us believe that the futuristic recent history on screen is a direct continuation of our reality today, and so that what would have normally been the comic hero choreographic deeds may be looked in the light of a manifesto that justifies violence for political reasons.It's a good cinema experience, and probably the best made entertainment movie done lately. There are many fine touches of British humor, and solid acting, with Natalie Portman giving a superb performance. If you watch it as entertainment, it's fine, but if you fall on the path of thinking to the implications beyond the story you may like it or not, as your political inclinations will start to interfere.",8,0,1,1 September 2006
The Island," THX-1138 meets video games
","'The Island' is a typical summertime movie - lots of action, very well filmed by the way, based on a science-fiction idea. The problem is that the premises are very good, so the limitation that director Michael Bay placed on himself really make you feel sorry that he did not aim higher. The first half hour looks very much in staging and idea to the early Lucas film THX-1138, all at bigger scale, of course. So that when this anti-orwellian theme is transformed in yet another car races and urban landscape destroying feast, you start feeling that this film could have been better, maybe getting close to 'Matrix' or 'Blade Runner'. Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor do a good job in the leading roles, and overall it is a satisfying summer entertainment movie that could have been more.",6,0,0,14 August 2005
