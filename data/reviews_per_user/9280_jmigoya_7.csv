The Avengers," The Best Of The Best Of The Best To Infinity!!!
","Just sat thru a 14 or 15 hr superhero marathon ending with The Avengers at around 12 midnight, it made all the previous superhero movies that came before it feel like a small tease snack leading up to the epic meal time main coarse. all i can say is WoW! the way they actually gave almost equal screen time to the characters and yet your favorite which ever one it is feels like they got the perfect amoount of screen time to compliment the movie. perfect balance and i mean perfect the length was also perfect (Stay after the Credits) Priceless, cant say enough about this movie, id say this was better than Than any superhero movie before it including The Dark Knight, this actually has the potential of dethroning Avatar as the top box office. This was Epic.",10,1,5,4 May 2012
Gravity," Pure Hollywood Magic, What an Incredible Movie
","just got back from seeing this movie and it truly was an experience to behold, see it in IMAX if you can, I think 3D is a must though I haven't seen it 2D so I cant compare, other than the fact that distances in this movie are very important and 3D delivers on that end. It truly gives you a sense of desperation in a very realistic way, I found myself gasping for air in some scenes and that really about says it all, you're right there with them, you feel it and at just 90 minutes long you feel like the movie is much longer but in a good way in that it transports you to space and makes you feel at least part of the helplessness and desperation that they are feeling, will not give any details about the movie because you all pretty much know from the trailer what the plot is pretty straight forward plot, I do agree with another reviewer's opinion that Sandra Bullock should get another Oscar for this and maybe its the source material but no one so far this year has taken their acting to this level, the people behind me were crying in several scenes, I almost did, Sandra has truly come along way since Demolition Man",10,3,7,7 October 2013
Creed," Fantastic but could of been Perfect
","you're probably wondering why my summary says Fantastic but could of been Phenomenal, well let me explain, this movie surpasses any expectations I had even for a Rocky movie, people will immediately say this is not a Rocky movie it's Creed movie it's a new story, and you'd be completely wrong, this movie continues the story of Rocky Balboa and just like you see in TV shows like The Walking Dead where they dedicate a show to do a back story on some character and then integrate them into the current story, well the same is done here, you see Creed getting in trouble as a youth with a short temper and likes to fight, fast forward several years and he finds out he's Apollo Creed's son, at this point the stories are starting to merge and when Adonis seeks out Rocky Balboa at his Restaurant still in business years later then it becomes a continuation of the Rocky Balboa story, yes the focus is on Adonis Creed but it's a continuation of the story not a side story and it is told beautifully, the movie for me was better than Rocky Balboa and obviously Rocky 5, but for me Rocky 1 thru 4 are still my favorites and for me are all a perfect 10, I'm a die hard Rocky fan and Creed would of benefited tremendously from a classic Rocky score, some of the Rocky music is in there but for a true Rocky movie fan it's just sprinkled lightly here and there throughout the movie, there is a scene towards the end of the movie that we actually get a Rocky movie score and that's when people at the theater came alive, I got goose bumps myself and felt the music really should of been more faithful to the Rocky series and make no mistake this movie was great, I truly loved it but it would of gone over the top to perfect if it had the appropriate score, I have no doubt you'll see a Fan Edit version of Creed in the future with the score reworked to be more in tune with a Rocky movie when the Blu Ray comes out, I've seen it done before with the recent release of A9 Prometheus (A9 being the editor) and a true die hard fan of Alien movies re worked the story and score of the movie even added deleted scenes and gave it a more Aliens movie franchise feel to it and in my opinion an improvement, A9 even re-did the Alien attack scene at the back of the bay doors to the ship and made the Alien look more like the traditional Alien but with notable differences, and trust me a Creed Fan Edit will be done because that's already the number 1 gripe with Rocky fans, the music, I can't wait to see it, but for now this will be the next best thing, great movie I give it a 9 out of 10",9,2,6,1 December 2015
Man of Steel," Man of Steel & The Avengers Tied for best Super Hero movie
","Man of Steel is the reason why I take movie critic reviews with a grain of salt (I accept their review as a personal opinion but there are too many variants at play that I always wait till its mass release to see what the common folks have to say about it)in this case I couldn't wait I saw it a day early in the Thursday night sneak preview, this Man of Steel is for Superman Films what the Star Trek 2009 Reboot was for Star Trek show and prior films, the story is there but just slightly different enough to make it fresh and more realistic to make it less corny, this is a serious Superman coming to terms since his childhood that he is different and those thoughts are reinforced by his earth father Jonathan Kent because of fear that he would become a government lab experiment, Clark has to endure bully's pushing around and insults, so needless to say for him to break out of that shell it is difficult he's a quiet man that for many years has learned not to bring attention to himself and to just blend and never stand out. that's my take on why he's not a humorous man, the action in this film trumps The Avengers and those who complain that there was too much destruction and that Superman is always conscious of not destroying buildings per the comics need to understand that this is the very beginning of Superman, great acting from everybody, I give it a solid 10 Stars no doubt about it",Null,4,8,16 June 2013
1917," One of The Greatest War Movies ever made
","To say this was a huge Surprise would be an Understatement, I had seen 2 or 3 different trailers before seeing it last night, nothing could have prepared me for what I experienced, it's as close to a tense yet incredibly enjoyable 2 hr Roller Coaster ride as you could get, This was the greatest one continuous shot type Film I have ever seen, The Pacing of the Film is like no other I've seen, the amount of onscreen story telling you experience feels way more than just the 2 hrs run time, it's just the perfect economy in motion pacing, a pause for just a minute and off to the next main objective, you'll see what I mean, the pacing is just masterful, the tension building is also phenomenal, Best Film by Far this Year in January of all months, can't imagine any other topping this Masterpiece",10,5,8,13 January 2020
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Definitely the best in the series, ending is Epic
","hey what can i say i liked the movie if you're into romantic movies as well as vampire flicks you'll dig this series there's no ifs ands or buts about it, i disagree with a lot of people complaining about the a animated baby its essentially the girl actress face turned into a baby form so rather than look for a pairing of baby and older actor they opted for a animated face which i didn't see the defects these people posted about but hey thats why there's a different shade of color for everyone because two people liked the same movie doesn't mean they'll both like a similar movie its individual taste,i thought it was really good and the ending, well you've probably read negative reviews on the movie but called the ending worth seeing the movie again for, ill just leave it at that it took me like a month to see this movie because of the bad reviews it initially got, I'm now glad i saw it 8 out of 10 for me",8,5,16,20 November 2012
The Conjuring," Perfect Blend of Horror Genres & this was a true Story!!!
","I had seen the trailer and loved it but nothing prepared me for what I saw on screen, My wife says the only movie to ever get under her skin was The Exorcist and I suspect that one goes for a lot of people I saw The Exorcist for the first time in my late teens and it didn't have that shock value to me that others felt when seeing it much younger, back to The Conjuring which now has become officially the only other movie to scare the hell out of my wife, I'm much more hardened when it comes to Horror movies but I got to tell you that I had shallow breathing at times and even had sweaty palms I loved every minute of it, A Horror movie done right, the based on a true story label in movies almost always results in the makers screwing it up for sure, well this time they pulled off a masterpiece of a Horror movie, I wont touch the subject of how accurate the film was based on the actual events that happened because I don't know, the book (which I have not read) seems to suggest this all actually happened, & that scares the crap outa me, If you don't handle tension well stay away, if anything that has to do with Demonic Possession & Exorcism scares you then stay away because we get a Ghost Haunting/Demonic Possession Movie that will not give you a breather, you will leave the theater spent, also I had no idea this Movie was Rated R, no Vulgar Language but they got the Rating for disturbing images. & the Possession scene is very intense. I suspect this movie will be playing at the theaters for 2 months or more & go on to make more money than any other this year and for good reason. 'A solid 10 Stars'",10,0,2,24 July 2013
