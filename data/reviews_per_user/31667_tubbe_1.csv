Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good, but didn't convince me!
","First excuse my poor English. Just saw Vol. 2 yesterday, know it's a bit late, but didn't really want to ruin the experience, made by the first Kill Bill movie, which was a piece of art. I don't see the link between the two movies. The first movie was definitely one of Tarantino's best yet, didn't beat Pulp, but it was also a different kind of movie all together. Vol. 1 was quite artistic in many ways... the huge amounts of blood, the cartoons, the whole atmosphere made the whole movie feel surrealistic. Vol. 2 was really an ordinary movie, the artistic boldness was gone. Perhaps it was intended this way, but to me the two movies didn't link.",Null,1,3,19 September 2004
