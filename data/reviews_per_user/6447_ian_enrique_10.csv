Train to Busan," Pretty Good
","Well,I want to do a review about this film warning!contain spoiler! What Can I say about this movie that it actually pretty good not perfect but just nice what I love about this movie is the cinematic value of this film very clean and not very predictable like I being told by everybody who watches this movie.Now I want to tell you about the plot is okay,so many difference character and scripted well.Love the plot that this happen on a train very good even though,I know it's not a real train but but think the CGI is very good now you maybe you think if this film is very good why I give only 9/10 because the ending is not very good and disappointed me not only that I don't agree that only two of people survived and what make me angry is An Son Hee character is death! Why you must kill her F**k you stupid Director! Darn it! But this film is good I recommended it go watch it worth your money P/S climax of this film will make your cry..",9,2,6,24 September 2016

Life of Pi," God works in mysterious way..
","After seeing this movie, I had learnt so many thing. This movie teaches us about life that sometimes life is hard like shell. But, if we trying to learn life can be simple so simple that we can tame a tiger but, if we learn from experience itself we can assume that life is just an ocean it's so big and full of some many creatures that we can't understand at all. Life is just a thing that a human being like us keep through although, there are sometimes a violent storm wind keep hitting on us but, if we keep strong and brave it can't affect us because it just temporarily.There is so many morals value in this movie I don't want to spoil it because I want you to feel it by yourself. The colour of this film is just beautiful. Ang Lee really is a genius this is not just a film or a movie this is a masterpiece! Wonderful! Amazing! Beyond of our imagination. Please, watch this movie you will not be disappointed.",10,0,2,15 July 2016

Spirited Away," Best Animation of all time
","I can't say much about this film because it's so beautiful this is not just a movie it's a masterpiece from the Godfather of Asian animation Hayao Miyazaki.There is so much lesson can be learned from this story and the moral value in this movie is so acceptable I don't want to spoil anything watch it for yourselves focus on the story you will get it.For 2001 animation I think Hayao Sama is a truly a genius man I'm so stunned by the beauty of this Film it make me chill.We can see the beauty and the view of the sea, grass, mountain like is just so real just three word to describe this film Awesome Amazing And Absoletly Brilliant!!!! 10 star!!",10,0,1,15 September 2016
