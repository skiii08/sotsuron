Changeling," If I liked my nose rubbed in it, I'd probably like this movie
","A shame that so much talent and money are used for a movie of this kind. While the craftsmanship of this movie is not bad (not marvelous, either) the really important question, in my opinion, is: Why call 'entertainment' a 2 hour showcase of human misery? At best, this movie can stir up outrage; more likely, depression.Is this movie worth the torture of watching it because it enlightens us as to how low can humans sink? WE ALREADY KNOW!!! (And here, we get MORE than TWO HOURS of it!!!Did this movie actually inspire anyone to go out and do something about the kind of thing it 'denounces'? I seriously doubt it.So, what's left?Two hours of human misery. I believe that depression, outrage, and the like actually affect our physical health!I am not advocating for 'looking the other way' or being less conscious in any way. Just let's try not to revel in the darkest side of humankind all that much.",3,7,22,4 March 2009
12 Monkeys," Great mental mouswheel! Everything I expect from Terry Gilliam
","I thought Brad Pitt was no good. I was mistaken.I knew Terry Gilliam was a genius. Not disappointed.I still have my doubts as to Bruce Willis' acting ability. Call it Terry Gilliam's hand, but the three performances of the main characters (Pitt, Willis and Madelaine Stowe) are flawless. If everything else were no good (which is NOT the case) Pitt's performance alone would be worth the time spent.But what I really love about this movie is the going-to-the-past paradoxes and the way they get beautifully weaved into a convincing story that even manages to elicit profound compassion, hilarity, admiration for the characters, and so on.See it, rent it, buy it, whatever.",10,0,1,4 March 2009
Madagascar," Should be top 10
","I have NOT read the comments on this picture. I probably won't check on responses to this comment, cause frankly, I check IMDb mainly for movie info. But I just HAD to say something that I can't believe this movie is so bad ranking. I just loved it!The main characters are good enough, the story is rich and funny enough, but when on top of that you throw Julien, the King of the lemurs (and sidekick) that's just too freakily funny and lovable to ignore!Always loved Ben Stiller and Chris Rock. Always LOVED computer animation (Shrek is top 5 of my comic movies).The visuals are also outstanding (And bare in mind that I watched this on a pirate DVD made in Russia) (sorry, if piracy offends). The quality was not the best...They even handled the flesh-eating friend-of-prey issue honestly, yet with lots of laughs. Yeah, yeah, I know: They finish killing innocent fish, but taken the setup into account I find it a rather elegant way out of the paradox.But i just LOOOOOOVED the lemurs, and proclaim myself a humble subject of King Julien.Elmer Homero",10,1,4,1 August 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," I HATE movies that portray suffering. This one is the exception
","Despite the fact that this movie is a terrible load of suffering and brutality, it manages to put through a message of hope: Even in the face of the worst injustices and literally murderous of circumstances, there is a last refuge inside every person. A place that nobody can violate... not even by killing you.The original Spanish version is worth very much... do not see a dubbed version if only to get the emotional acting that comes through the voices.This actually constitutes (in my humble opinion) the only argument in favor of escaping reality that has merit.The special effects are great.Do not take your children!!!",9,1,5,5 March 2009
Clash of the Titans," I hope never to see another movie this bad.
","I KNOW that departing from the actual stories that Greek mythology tells is expected in films these days.I would have even enjoyed it if the writers were to take liberties with the original in order to do good storytelling.But what these people did was to butcher mythology in order to tell a perfectly inane story... or more accurately: no story at all.Greek (and Norse) mythology have survived for centuries (what has gotten to us, anyway) because it is most of the time magnificent storytelling. If you want to take the characters and use them in a different story, the least you can do for yourself and for your audience is to write something worth watching. Have some MERCY with the audience!!!",1,11,16,16 May 2010
The Matrix," Best sci-fi ever done.
","I just have to review this movie, even if it is a decade after it was made (I loved it that much)!One thing I don't see often is reference to the part of the film that deals with faith (mostly, about The Oracle). I find this part of the movie particularly nicely done. A great answer to the question: 'What form would human faith take in a world in which humans are less than slaves to thinking machines?' I think this also has to do with the fact that the best piece of acting is given by Laurence Fishburne, who depicts quite well a 'man of faith'.The whole disquisition about what is reality and Neo waking up to learn that his whole life has just been an induced fantasy are just too juicy not to love!Some acting in it is not first rate, but the rest of the film (everybody knows that the visual effects set a breaking point in cinema history) carries it greatly.It is difficult to believe that this jewel came from the same minds that gave us the enormously disappointing Matrix II and III.",10,2,4,4 March 2009
