Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Oh no,thank you
","When someone tells you the premise of this movie, your little heart just gets so excited. Your imagination just goes wild with the possibilities... then you hear the dang rabbits voice (ppppppleeeaase)and blam your heart just breaks..and you have to have your arms tied so you don't pull out your hair by the roots. It helps if you look at in on mute and just have the close caption up. The way that they were able to pull this off is just mesmerizing. That red dress is.. amazing. Personal issues aside, this movie is worth checking out just to see how wonderful everything looks. And if you find yourself wanting to commit murder upon exposure to Roger Rabbits voice, hit mute and chillax.",3,2,14,12 February 2015
World War Z," Nice little addition to Zombie lore
","I don't admit this too often, but I don't like Mr Pitt. I had stayed away form any movie that had him in it. Then one day, I heard an interview that he had done to promote this film. I remember he said something along the lines of:' my kids love zombies and I wanted to make a zombie movie for them'.Well, that over rode everything that I initially thought about Mr Pitt. How do you make...no,no.. what kind of movie would you make for your kids?!?!?! Let me tell you, this movie was not that bad. I was very surprised about that. I expected something goofy..maybe childish. This is anything but. It's not overly gory, but it does have it's jump in your seat moments. I have not read the book so not able to say whether it is faithful to that story line.",7,0,1,12 February 2015
The Fifth Element," True Classic IMO
","I love everything about this film. I like the look, the story,the pace, the action and the seamless ability all of the actors had in telling this story. It is made in such a way that it's a believable place,time and people. All the characters are three dimensional. Even the guy that Korben compliments on his hat choice is believable. I wanna go eat at that McDonald's. I wanna get some soup from that little oriental guy that offers to buy Korben his lunch. If I were to get a little teeny tiny bit picky, my only trouble was with the clothes. I don't think I would be able to pull off any of their outfits. Gosh, I even found Luke Perry interesting in this! And I don't much like Mr. Perry. Chris Tucker's character has all signs pointing to being annoying like Jar Jar Bing or Roger Rabbit but I found him very amusing instead.",10,1,2,13 February 2015
Stardust," True fairy tale
","This movie made me feel like I could believe in magic again. It was like my mother was reading me a fairytale and it was coming alive before my eyes. It had royalty, witches, pirates and magic. Lots and lots of magic. It was done so beautifully, so perfectly. And no matter how much screen time each actor had, their input was essential to move the story along.Peter O'Toole, Henry Cavill, David Kelly, and Ricky Gervais are very good examples of this. The movie was very well paced, the story was fantastically told. And you had sword fights, pirates coming to the rescue, and a witch that you could not help but giggle along with every time she did something wicked.",10,3,3,16 February 2015
War of the Worlds," Just cuz Tom is on it
","I have a secret. I don't like Dakota Fanning. I keep waiting for her to not have the effect of creeping my out every time I see her, and it hasn't happened yet. The first time I saw her, she was really young, but she looked older to me somehow. Like someone had lied about her age and she was just a really small adult. So I tend not to look at any of her movies. But Tom is on this, so I stayed away as long as I could. But she is just too present in this. So I could not really enjoy it like how I had hopped. It's not a bad movie, if anything the ending to me was a little too abrupt. Like they either ran out of money or time. And yet it's still not a bad movie. It does kinda draw you in, you want to find out what is going to happen to them. You want for Tom and the kids to end up Okay.. yes even the little creepy one. Its been almost 10yrs now since this movie came out. Maybe they'll try again. Keep Tom and Justin...and maybe Dakota is away at camp or something",7,0,1,16 February 2015
The Silence of the Lambs," Really liked this film
","I don't think I relaxed the white knuckle grip on the edge of my seat from start to finish. This is what story telling is all about. It's easily the type of film that whenever you catch it on t.v., you have to watch it till the end, commercial breaks, time constraints and all. Jodie foster impressed me more in this film than she has in any other that I have seen her in. And to say that Mr Hopkins is what nightmares are made of would really not be giving him enough credit for what he is able to pull off on this film.The pace of the story, the soundtrack, even the amount of violence that they decide to use or not use is so well done in shaping this film.",10,1,1,11 February 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Best I have seen so far this year
","The trailer hooked me so good. Every time it would come on, I would need to stop what I was doing to see it all the way through. Usually when this happens, that just means I have set the expectations on a film too high. It happened with Robocop, for example... and the Lego Movie. But this one did not disappoint me at all. I was pleasantly surprised with what the movie ended up being about. And after seeing Mr. Firth fight on both of the Bridget Jones movies, I was so not expecting him to be able to open up a can of whop a-.I have to say, they need to give Mr Jackson more roles like this. He is so good. I hadn't seen such a good action movie in a while. The pace, the story and the action were just perfect,IMO.",9,1,6,16 February 2015
