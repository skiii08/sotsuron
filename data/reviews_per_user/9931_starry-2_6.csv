Scarface," An indulgent drug crime rags to riches fantasy.
","This film was too heavy and for some reason not a success upon its release. But like Blade Runner, it slowly gained a massive cult status and aged like fine wine, finding its place in cinema history. Written by Oliver Stone (who partook in 'method writing' (!) ) and directed by Brian DePalma, this violent and daring film is a relentless masterpiece, a study in rags to riches, criminality and narcissism to the extreme. Al Pacino is absorbed in this character that we forget its Pacino (the only other actors to do this that comes to mind were Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now). This movie is so early 80s in terms of its look and production design/sets that Miami becomes a character unto itself. (As is cocaine...the monetary motivator in this film). The movie plays out like a dream...the events unfold in a surrealistic way, things get more disturbing and chaotic and ruthless as it goes on. The main character and his co-hort are confronted with so many challenges and their daring sacrificial attempts at making it rich at the expense of anything/anyhow/anywhere is sonewhat cool and amusing, all in a disturbing way. The music score is novelty yet epic, and it's no wonder that the rap music culture took heart to this movie due to its romance with violence and brutality and the flexing of money. This isn't for everyone but worth a look- it's one of DePalma's finest commercial films and kudos go to Universal's executives who saw fit to invest in producing this film because it makes sense and gets better with every year that passes. The 4k bluray looks amazing. Technology is so good these days that the amount of film grain seems to be easily controlled. For an old film, this digital transfer makes this film look like its shot in the early 2000s, making this more appealing for the most scrutinizing viewer who thinks any movie older than 5 years is too aged and not visually appealing. The hdr contradt and colors are punchy and vibrant and for the first time since its theatrical release, we finally get to see this film as it was intended to be seen in all its south Florida razor blade glory. (Previous versions, from VHS to laser disc to early days of dvd looked and sounded flat). The soundtrack/soundeffects are more hi fi than ever making this a good fit/competitor with films all throughout the last 20 years. I rate the movie a 7 out of 10. The technical presentation is visual: 5 out of 5 and 4.5 for the audio. This film is a good commercial curio done in the spirit of a guerilla indie film. An indulgent crime fantasy to the extreme.",7,0,1,21 October 2019
Alien," PerfectiMasterful blend of atmospherics and primal fear and the unknown. A Ridley Scott masterpiece.
","Warning: Spoilers.Finally cinema's premier ambient genius atmospheric and primal fear sci-fi & horror masterpiece (directed brilliantly by Ridley Scott) gets the 4k treatment for home viewing. This film, the arty sci-fi version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, starts with a brooding isolation in space mood then builds nicely when the 'truckers in space' land on a derelict planet to find the source of an alien transmission which may be a warning according to a female crew member. What happens then is that a bizarre alien species with an interesting life cycle then begins to be the hunter and one by one gets each crew member. The film is a first for showing a very visceral graphic violent scene which scared off audience members while making the others sick. The acting is superb. Ian Holm as Ash, is acted amazingly. It's funny in a smart way how much human traits he has in his personality- his deceptive ways, the high-strung and annoyed aspects are so intense and highly reactive that its almost funny in a good way. John Hurt's character is devoted, enthusiastic and meek in comparison. His curiosity gets the best of him however. It's also interesting to note that after 35 years of watching this film that I now see that captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), also annoyed and high strung is actually going along with Ash and his constant bickering reminders that the alien must go back to earth for study despite the company's secret 'Special Orders' in that the alien is of highest priority and that the crew is expendable. The rest of the acting by Yaphet Kotto (cocky alpha brave male), Harry Dean Stanton, his right hand man and parrot ('RIIIIIIGGGGHHT...' is amusing), Veronica Cartwright (frail and adds fear and tension at her improvised crying helpless scenes (something she does rather well- see her performance as a child in Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds) and Sigourney Weaver as the proper ethical company person who takes the cake and balls in the film and innovates to dispose of the beast. The Alien and the planet's topography and Alien derelict ship was designed by Swiss surrealist painter and sculptor H.R. Ginger. No expense was spared- here he created sexually suggestive and ultra creepy aspects to the creature (a mix of organic and mechanical dna) and landscape. The tension builds up so amazingly that you'll find yourself downright baking in fear whilst rooting for the heroine to be to kill the alien or successfully escape. The music by Jerry gold Smith's a winner here...bizarre yet fitting classical ambient with a weird cool depressing down tone compliments the action while translating the story into more atmosphere and fear, rather artistically. This film was a huge success and its trajectory is unforgettable and relentless. This became an ultra huge comercial cult hit and is the best of the franchise it brewed. The vast nature of space, 7 crew members, one ship and one hell of a unique, hostile and clever alien that has Kill on its mind. He director has the audience gripping their seats throughout that the surprise stick he throws at us, the viewers, into the drama's spokes is more than a acceptable and furthers the constant building of relentlessness. It's perfect right down to the end credits' music, which plays out ironically like funeral music and great ending mellow classical fanfare. ALIEN is one of the best films in the past 40 years. It never ages and of course never let's go.The 4k blu ray's image is a 4 out of 5, as it was transferred around 2013/4 using earlier equipment. I suspect the original 35mm film negative was not used as the film looks like a bit of a well worn faded documentary film. However that's to the analytical eye....the lighting is meant to look that way. The sound is superb, and you can listen to every mix they ever made for it it...from dolby pro logic matrixed mixes to early ac-3 (5.1 surround) for laser discs to a new 7.1 mix. Included are audio commentaries and the cash grab 2003 extended cut. Alien is a masterpiece of psychology , fight for survival while living a nightmare that keeps getting worse.",10,2,3,18 October 2019
The Shining," Legendary mysterious controversial Kubrick film is superb
","One of mastermind director stanley Kubrick's most controversial, challenging and stylistic and mysterious films- about madness, psychic phenomena and spiritual hauntings (based on the Stephen King book). This 4k restoration is masterfully tweaked and transferred with great bright colorful hdr signal with a perfect film grain structure. (Transfer was supervised by Steven Spielberg and Kubrick's longtime personal asisstant, leon vitali). For hardcore fans and perfectionists, they will discover that the frame aspect ratio is very slightly off what it's supposed to be, (its zoomed a pinch) however there's hardly a difference. The visual quality is amazingly superb reference quality....to be expected since its kubrick. (Check out the 2001 space odyssey 4k disc to know what I'm talking about)... the 5.1 surround sound remix is quite good, though staccato in nature (sporadic, popping out of nowhere in between long moments of silence from the rear speakers) due to the fact that it was never designed for surround in the first place. It would have been nice to have a well thought out and designed mono soundtrack since the original is worn out and damaged in terms of its dynamics the remix comes pretty close. The dialog track is more present and deep compared to the previous 1080p blu ray. The story itself is captivating and perhaps a too rushed portrayal of a man descending into madness with his symbolic previous alcohol problem and of course his run in with ghosts. Shelley Duvall who plays his wife put all of herself into her performance and then some . She should have won best oscar performance that year. The film is a bit dated and uneven but kubrick inserts so many cool uses of avant garden music and surreal sequences that it makes up for all the uneven flow and abrupt transitions in the storytelling. This film is a curio of sorts, featuring memorable famous moments by jack Nicholson. My favourite humorous human moment in the film is when we see scatman crother's character back in Florida silently receiving a psychic communication by the psychic child character back in Colorado. Crothers' gives his infamous 'kubrick stare' whilst lying in bed watching tv . The camera zooms out to reveal a velvet painting of sorts of a nude African american woman above his bed. Perfect. Amusing. Deep. Says it all in terms of kubrickian peculiarities and attention to detail. (My second favorite wee moment is in the beginning of the fil when jack is being shown around the hotel and the two female employees walk by and then jack walks in the room only to give them s double take! That said... Otherwise, the movie still retains some horror and spookiness to it. The opening titles with deus irae performed by wendy carlos and Rachel Elkind is among the best (up there with Alien (1979) title sequence and Jaws' as well as blade runner series.) The existential and symbolism and 'puzzle' element is among the best films to ever include such things, and despite countless viewings I still see new things I it with each subsequent screening. Not for everyone- either you'll love it and consider it a masterpiece of horror, ghosts and art (with dynamite editing), or you'll find it too esoteric perhaps. Nonetheless it's a masterpiece technically as it's one if the first Steadicam films out there (smooth following motion....predominates most of the camera shots stylistically and previously never used as much) , and it features imaginative scenes and legendary bits of dialogue from jack Nicholson. ('Heeeere's Johnny!'). I rate the film a four out of five, and perhaps my fourth favorite kubrick film. The technical 4k presentation is a 6 out of 5 (!). I look forward to seeing every 4k kubrick restoration and expect nothing but the best sound and visually. (2019 4k restoration blu ray review)",8,0,0,18 October 2019
Apocalypse Now," 4k final cut general review of an arthouse psychedelic vietnam war era film
","This is an amazing and well priced definitive collection of one of the best films of the 1970s and perhaps of all time, the psychedelic and intense Vietnam war era film Apocalypse Now. Like the director (Francis Ford Coppola, who also directed the Godfather series and The Conversation- another best of the 70s film) said in a press conference...this film IS Vietnam. This edition consists of the recently assembled ''final cut'...which is somewhere in length between what was the Redux version and the original 1978 cut. I find it a little more fascinating and gets a little more in depth about the journey and mission martin sheen's character gets involved with. It's the best of Redux really. But what's great about this set is that it comes with all three versions on 3 separate discs so no one is left unsatisfied. It also comes with regular 1080p blu ray versions along with the fantastic unique behind the scenes documentary from 1991 called Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse. I would rate the 4k visual presentation at 4 out of 5...the elements used in the transfer to digital are a little faded and I suspect multiple sources of film elements were used to make the final cut. However the cinematography of the film is so strong and well lit that it really overshadows any generational loss or fine details issues. The use of neutral density filters in the shooting of the film is prominent and the hdr color and wide contrast reproduction is vivid and blends beautifully. What is much more amazing is the work that went into the surround sound remix for this release. The low end pulses rather dramatically and deeply and the high end fidelity is penetrating. The use of The Doors' 'The End' song in the infamous dazzling opening shots/scenes are so mesmerizing and spacious that it gets right deep into your brain via your ears and vibrations through your spinal column. This film is reputed as one of the best sound designed films and it's true. It's one of the only films in existence whereby you can listen to the film with the visuals/tv off and still be able to get the story of the film in great detail. It's a testament to pure artistry and psychology delivery via editing of sound and picture. This goes with Thanks to the ultra genius craftsman of film overall, Walter Murch. It's hard to say which cut is better, which is great that all 3 are here in this collection. I rate this film (no matter which cut/length) a 12 out of 10. The 4k restoration is a 4 out of 5 as stated previously and the sound reproduction, Do get this if you are a fan, or just curious. It's a rare perfect movie thats immersive- delving deep into morality, 'tripping out' and of course, madness. Get some Coppola estates red wine and a nice joint and kick back to this fine fine piece of cinema. Its a keystone and testament to how a story should be told.",10,3,3,18 October 2019
Schindler's List," General review of Spielberg's personal art film (4k disc release)
","This is no doubt one of the most important movies of the last 30 years. It was an intense passion project of director steven spielberg. Based on true, horrible, horrible events in poland from WWII, we are taken through one man's journey from being a wartime profiteer to that of a compassionate saviour, rescuing many Jews from peril. Shot in glorious black and white film by dop janusz kaminski, the film tonality acts as a truthful portal into the brutal times of German nazi occupation and the goings on in the horrific work and death camps this is a film that proved that spielberg was and is a true masterful artist and auteur. The arthouse editing tells the story on a thread that also contains small bits of humor. ( One of the best scenes in the film and in perhaps modern cinema is the intro to character amon goethe). The violence is so brutal that you can subconsciously see red in the almost black blood. The 4k transfer, supervised by spielberg, is crisp, modern yet retains a theatrical film screening look and feel.",10,1,3,18 October 2019
The Wrestler," One of the finest touching stories of redemption and grim reality of has-beens
","One of the best films of the first decade of the 2000s. The director is one of the best currently still working (up there with pt anderson). Tjis is an entertaining thoughtful story of a has been entertainment wrestler who is now ailing and older and highly struggling to make ends meet. Mickey Rourke should have wo the best actor oscar for his portrayal of said main character. In the film we experience touching moments when he tries to get serious with a stripper, and as well trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter. It's very honest, in depth and at times straight up or oddly funny. It features some digestible yet deep serious psychology to it. The director knows humanity so well overall that this film features one of the best depictions of what trash really is- I'm talking in the scene where the main character parties hard with a white trash sttumpet chick and spends the night in her low budget row socisl housing house and find that she's got a sick firefighter obsession. The fact that she's got s pet ferret says it all. The film also shows some great violent wrestling scenes for fans of the entertainment sport. The actor who plays the stripper, his love interest and supporter/ champion of sorts should have won her second oscar for this as well. An awesome movie with no wasted frames ending with a beautiful existential moment. The gritty 16mm film cinematography captures the spirit of the film too.",10,1,1,18 October 2019
