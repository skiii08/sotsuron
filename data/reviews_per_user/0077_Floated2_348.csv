The Rock," Solid action thriller
","The Rock maybe seen as an earlier film by director Michael Bay. It appears that Bay had always had his way with action type films. While The Rock proved that Sean Connery could still cut the mustard as an OAP action star, it was the making of Cage as action hero, his wild and wired approach gelling perfectly with Connery ís gruff demeanor. Overall this film does fulfill for action fans, although it does feel quite long in run time and seems to drag. Nonetheless, one of Michael Bay's best films of the 1990's.",7,3,3,11 July 2018
The Devil's Advocate," Intriguing thriller
","There are several great courtroom drama films and many of them may follow a similar route. With the Devil's Advocate, this film isn't just a typical courtroom drama but more so experiments with the supernatural and thriller aspects.Seeing as the rating for this film is currently quite high (7.5 IMDB) and having little expectations but was expecting several twists, did not leave disappointed. The acting all around by the leads are great. As this is one of Keanu Reeves better performances, Al Pacino in playing a similar type of character and Charlize Theron in one of her earlier roles. They all shine and make the film worthwhile simply for their performances.With a runtime of over two hours 20 minutes, the film paces itself and is quite layered. A lot of key details and little subplots along the way to keep entertained. Though what is predictable is that we knew there would be some twists along the way, though the twists that is revealed is quite clever and makes us think back to the beginning of the film. It also may seem like a cop out in the very end but none the less, this is a great and entertaining thriller.",8,0,1,6 October 2019
The Lobster," Interesting Premise but Disappointing result
","The Lobster features and interesting premise in itself as it is brilliant and loaded with comic situations, but where the movie goes wrong is in its cynical attitude towards the dating world. It tries hard to distinguishing itself and be creative and unique, only for the actual result of the film to be quite boring and doesn't seem to live up to its potential of ideas. Though one could argue there's a really wonderful love story buried somewhere beneath this cynicism, director Lanthimos' attitude towards society and relationships in particular is awfully bleak that it comes across cold and emotionally distant. The scenes at the hotel, while certainly better in their own twisted way, are an exaggerated response to the dangers of conformity. The Lobster feels longer than it's running time, and does not feel satisfied once the film ends. It isn't as funny as several critics claim, and although it is quite different, that does not necessarily make it good. Certainly this is a film for those of acquired taste.",3,2,2,23 December 2016
The Benchwarmers," just awful
","I went to see this movie online because I heard it was great and hilarious from a few friends, and it was completely terrible! I didn't laugh once. It was a very predictable movie. There was nothing really good about this movie. It was just very cheesy filled with lame jokes and annoying kids. I would not recommend anyone to see this movie, because it will bore you to death. The movie is very clichÃ© and was pretty boring. It had scenes with a midget, a big guy wanting a little person, annoying commentators as kids, gay innuendos, a 30 something year-old pretending to be 12, and some really bad dialogue.Example; Ritchie: you smell like beer. Carlos: you look like beer. I don't get it, what does he mean by 'you look like beer'. Is it that he drinks a lot of beer that he envisions him as beer or that he's shaped as a beverage. Anyways don't see it",2,2,4,10 October 2008
Moneyball," Inspirational true life sports drama
","For non sports fans or fans of true live films, Money has been seen and well praised in its own rights as a true based film. The acting performances from Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are what stands out in the film, as well as the nature of the aspect that the film is based upon true events. Hvaing little to no knowledge of the true story, the film depicts what Hollywood believed as to what happened, within the baseball team and season of 2002. Moneyball is well written, directed and has enough suspense and drama that keeps it entertaining. For non baseball fans or sports fans, might consider the film as boring but it is a rather slower paced drama that builds as the film goes.",7,1,1,26 August 2017
The Avengers," Big Loud Messy Entertainment
","The Avengers was very well waited among Marvel comic book fans and general superhero fans. When it comes to delving deeply into the minds or motivations of the film's other, previously established heroes, he abstains all together. And maybe that's for the best. Even with 2 hours and 24 minutes to kill, there's precious little time for him to offer remedial courses in Marvel mythology. Those who haven't done their homework and watched the previous films still should be able to follow the basics, but they almost certainly will be left scratching their heads from time to time. In the mix among stars doing battle are Scarlett Johansson, who plays the Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as archery expert Hawkeye. There were a lot of high expectations for this film and on many levels it delivers, while on few others it disappoints. Since writer-director Joss Whedon was dealing with so many big-name stars, like Robert Downey Jr., who reprises his role as Iron Man, Gwenyth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Mark Ruffalo, who takes over the role of Dr. Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk, there's just not enough screen time to fit everyone adequately in.For those who have kept up with it, though, The Avengers is a nice payoff to a sprawling and ambitious filmmaking strategy, and one whose blueprint can be counted on to change the way major studios approach their superhero franchises for years to come.
==========
As a rewatch 05/01/18' and nearly 5 years since initial watch 12/10/13' opinions remain near same. The Avengers has great entertainment value, though at the same time some of it feels quite bland and uninteresting. The finale battle elevates the film as a whole but much forgettable scenes I had forgotten.",6,5,11,10 December 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Not as good as the original but decent
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets is the sequel to successful film National Treasure released in 2004. In this film, the secretly embedded key is on a torn out page of a diary, though not just any diary. This is one of historic significance. Reviewing and watching the film, we the audience notices that it is the diary of John Wilkes Booth, the evil plotter who assassinated Abraham Lincoln, containing the detailed preparations leading up to that tragic event. Through the film, Gate's estranged archivist wife Abigail Chase's (pretty Diane Kruger) new boyfriend who happens, by virtue of his Secret Service connections, to be able to provide access to the hallowed stacks in the Library of Congress (instead of the Smithsonian) and, later, to the Oval Office; thence to Paris, to London and ultimately back to America. The film is filled with more clever hints but as a whole it does not appear as good as the original. It may not be as rehashed, which is good and is quite entertaining but it could have been greater as a whole.",6,0,0,16 June 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Visually stunning exprience
","Blade Runner 2049 delivers as a unique and interesting visually stunning film. Although there is more to the story as the film does begin quite slow, once it fully ejects itself, it becomes a great ride. We can see why this film did not do well at the box office as the studios expected, as many audience members claim the film was too long, slow and boring. Although the film does move at a slow pace, its visuals is what makes the film great.The story isn't that complex and quite confusing at first but the more watched, the more you begin to further understand what is occurring. Although there could have been more scenes of action, and more tense moments. And some scenes do somewhat drag on a bit. With its run time at 2 hours 43 minutes, there feels like much happening but also feels quite long.Blade Runner 2049 is more of a one actor show, in which Ryan Gosling stars as officer K. Many trailers showed Harrison Ford quite much in the trailer as we assumed his role would be a major part, though he is heavily reduced as doesn't come in the film until the end, within the third act or so.Despite its flaws, this film is quite an experience, and its shame more Hollywood films aren't like this. Perhaps another viewing in the future will satisfy and be necessary.",7,1,4,19 January 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," An Improvement over Vol. 1
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the sequel one year later than the original processor Kill Bill. Being released as two separate parts within a year of each other, Quentin Tarantino understood what he was getting at. Volume 2 in this franchise lays out more of a plot, more in depth and remains more focus than the original. There is more suspense and thrills and it is overall a more entertaining and intriguing watch. Mainly thanks of David Carradine's portrayal as Bill, as he has more screen time and answers are answered more regarding his relationship with The Bride (however her name was revealed).Though what is less than stellar and quite disappointing is the final showdown between the Bride and Bill. We understood the main purpose of the film is the revenge of the Bride against Bill and the build up was all for a chaotic scene between the two, but what is left happening doesn't live up to the hype, as nothing mesmerizing occurs between the two. Though leading up to the final end scenes, occurs key and important scenes involving both the Bride and Bill, and introducing their four year old daughter. This was well done. The bride was also less aggressive and more persistent in Vol. 2 which made her character more likable as we got a better understanding at her backstory. Overall, Vol. 2 had its moments and an improvement over Vol. 1.",7,0,1,30 June 2017
First Man," Somewhat depressing and dragging
","First Man has been praised by critics but not as long by audiences. Having expectations for this film but not completely as excited, expectations fell short.The acting is well as is the visuals and colors but as a film it was lore so depressing and generally boring than expected. Some decent scenes but not too much entertainment. It was a biopic but felt at times like a documentary. Parts towards the middle dragged on.",5,2,3,9 September 2019
Black Swan," Dark and mesmerizing
","With an Oscar win for best performance in a leading role rewarded to Natalie Portman, Black Swan is regarded as one of her best roles. This film starts off quite tame in tone then we do see the shift within the tone as things get darker, more violence is shown and there are occasional yet confusing hallucinations which seem to appear.Black Swan is mainly about ballet but the story revolving around Natalie Portman is much more. Mila Kunis also delivers a very good performance. At times the film does become confusing, specifically the ending in which maybe open for different interpretations.",8,0,0,28 February 2020
Men in Black 3," Outdated but a Decent watch
","Not being a fan of the Men in Black franchise and finding the third film to being a slightly unnecessary addition to the franchise, my expectations were average. Men In Black 3 was basically what was expected. Some laughs, good use of special effects, decent action and a solid plot. I think more could have happened (especially towards the end) but it was okay. It has also been a while since I have watched the first two films of the franchise, seeing as my memory wasn't the best from watching MIB3.When Men in Black 3 was rumored to come out, I wondered why it took so long and why they bothered bringing the franchise back (save for the money). However everything seemed to be in place and the actors played their parts as if the franchise hasn't been off for a decade.I didn't care too much for the villain of Doris the animal too bad as I think it could had been more interesting. Time travel in sci-fi films is always a positive as it was well done here. The chemistry between Will Smith and Josh Brolin was great here. The supporting characters were neatly done. Along the way, Smith and Brolin seek Griffin (a mysterious man that is able to see in the future and eventually guides them as their journey goes on). Griffin was great as we stole many scenes he was in. Overall Men in Black 3 is solid but nothing too special as I and others should revise the first two films from the franchise.",6,2,4,23 December 2013
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Offensive but quite entertaining
","After having watched Sacha Baron Cohen's other films in Bruno and The Dictator, and having not seen Borat but being quite familiar with the film and knowing of its success and strong feedback. As a film, Cohen portrays the character of Borat well as it does feel genuine and we can't always tell which scenes are scripted and which are authentic. The film does feature much offensive jokes about stereotypes, racism, religious themes and others and often does take several things quite far (the nude wrestling with him and his manager in his hotel room for one).But overall, it does provide genuine laughs and has a certain entertainment factor about it. Unlike Bruno, in which we can see is more of a replica of Borat, this film is overall more entertaining and better simply because the character of Borat is better and isn't as forced as Bruno. Perhaps people's perceptions would be different if Bruno were made and released before Borat.Though the film does feel like several unrelated scenes one after another, there is somewhat of a plot as it unfolds in the end. Another thing, the film doesn't tend to drag since it is quite short in runtime (83 minutes), which is beneficial to the film and its audience. It is a film which is offensive and severely not for everyone, which is understood. Borat was released in 2006 and in today's time seem to be considered a classic to many. It has seemingly aged well.",8,1,1,1 May 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Much upgrade over the 2003 Hulk
","The Incredible Hulk starring Edward Norton is quite easily an upgrade over Ang Lee's Hulk released in 2003 for several reasons. Having watched both films right after one another, it is clear this version is superior.First off Edward Norton's performance as Bruce Banner is more convincing than Eric Bana as he shows much more emotion and range as Banner, and is easier to root for. Same with Liv Tyler, as she is quite easily an upgrade over Jennifer Connelly's Betty Ross.More action and this film doesn't feel as forced as the 2003 version. Also more humor and some unintentional funny moments for comic relief.This film also doesn't drag its plot along and doesn't have the same abusive father storyline with flashbacks. It gets right into the story and immediately becomes quite thrilling and entertaining.The CGI of the Hulk looked better all around. The battle scene at the end was a good watch.",7,2,3,3 May 2019
Lucky Number Slevin," Decent but not as great as its rating
","Lucky Number Slevin takes a familiar take upon past better films such as Pulp Fiction. Involving an intricate, multilayered story structure constructed around a case of mistaken identity, 'Lucky Number Slevin,' boosted as it is by a former A-list ensemble cast and a heavy dose of intrigue, crosses the unfortunate line between clever and pretentious, rendering itself tiresome long before its heavily built-up denouement. Screenwriter Jason Smilovic's dialogue, which fills characters' mouths with fast-paced exchanges and protracted analogies, has been described in production notes as the film's 'heightened language.' And while purposefully stylized and unnatural, the affected speech that becomes the pic's hallmark serves to distract from, rather than enhance, the genuinely gripping labyrinth of twists and turns.At the center of 'Lucky Number Slevin's' maelstrom is the eponymous Slevin (Josh Hartnett), whose run of bad luck hits an all-time high the moment he arrives in New York City to stay with his friend Nick (Sam Jaegar). Finding his old buddy's apartment empty, Slevin decides to settle in while awaiting Nick's eventual return. Slevin subsequently is abducted by a set of bodyguards and taken to the penthouse of The Boss (Morgan Freeman), who thinks that Slevin is Nick. It seems that Nick owes The Boss, and The Boss plans to cash in by having Nick -- who is really, of course, poor Slevin -- off the son of a rival. If Nick/Slevin doesn't agree to the deed, he will be the one killed. Returned to the apartment, Slevin is nabbed by a second set of thugs.Delivered to the penthouse suite of The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley), located directly across the street from The Boss' abode, Slevin is once again thought to be Nick, who is also deep in debt to The Rabbi. Sworn enemies with The Boss, The Rabbi also gives Nick/Slevin the choice to destroy his nemesis or else die himself. Complicating matters is the fact that Slevin is being tracked by a mysterious assassin named Goodkat (Bruce Willis), who is somehow manipulating the not-so coincidental circumstances, as well as an NYC detective (Stanley Tucci) investigating the two crime bosses. Slevin's sole confidant in this muddle is Nick's perky and adventurous neighbor Lindsey (Lucy Liu), whose involvement with her newfound friend takes an intimate turn.=== As a rewatch 07/13/18' Lucky Number Slevin is quite an interesting watch with a lot of things happening. The film is quite a good mystery type dark comedy thriller and did enjoy it on another watch. Though can still see the flaws within the film that could have made it better. As we watch the ending unfold and see how everything truly was, a lot of it was predictable in a way though still entertaining. A main reason was due to Josh Hartnett's performance. For a character that was put in many 'coincidences' within the film, he didn't play it as someone who was worried or in too deep of situations. He played it cool throughout as if he knew he was never fully in danger. Somewhat confusing in the end with many plot twists though also engaging. Rating changed from 5 to 7.",7,1,2,7 January 2014
Sucker Punch," If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.
","Sucker Punch is a film by director Zack Synder (300, Watchmen) which glorifies violence with great visuals and has wonderful cinematography. Sucker Punch is an action movie and the action scenes are brilliantly made. A lot of criticism seems to stream that the film was not rated R (probably would have been better- making it more realistic) and that the story is thin. However, this did not bother me as I had no expectations and did not watch this for a complex story. I was interested and entertained throughout the film and I feel that Synder did his job well.Sucker Punch isn't that completely brainless and pointless, there is a story within it and one would get confused it they are not paying attention. The acting was solid, Emily Browning steals the film as the lead as Babydoll. Abie Cornish does well as Sweatpea, the leader of the group who isn't convinced of Babydoll's ways. The rest of the girls Rocket, Blondie and Amber are solid supporting cast, however more could have been explained more for their characters. Carly Gugino and Oscar Isaac also do a great job portraying their characters. Overall Sucker Punch is a fun ride and not nearly as bad as some of the critics have been pointing out.",8,4,7,17 July 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Great successful followup sequel
","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is an intense, claustrophobic surprise of a film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Michelle who, in the film's urgent opening sequence, desperately flees New Orleans to escape from her fiancé Ben for reasons unexplained. In the dead of the night her car plunges off the road and she awakes to find herself a prisoner in a concrete-walled cell, attached to a drip and fed and watered by Howard (John Goodman). Michelle is understandably dubious– Howard is clearly a survivalist and she soon finds that she's not alone well-stocked hideaway. She meets Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) who apparently witnessed the attack and fled to the bunker. It soon becomes evident that something has happened outside and the trio settle into an uneasy existence underground, prepared to sit out the two years or so it might take for conditions above ground to sustain human life. The film is restless and uneasy, punctuated by a sense that something just isn't right here, that the whole story isn't being told. Edgy and discomfiting, we're never allowed to sit back and relax; we're waiting for the next trauma, the next moment of explosive confrontation. Winstead is brilliant as the resourceful, desperate Michelle but Goodman is quite astonishing as gruff man- mountain Howard and the relationship that develops between the pair crackles with tension and barely-disguised threat. The film's slow burn eventually erupts into fire and violence and, without drifting too far into spoiler territory, it's fair to suggest that fans of Cloverfield frustrated by the intimate human drama of the first hour or so of Cloverfield Lane are likely to feel a bit more at home with the extraordinary turn of events which send the last reel hurtling off into an entirely different, but no less exhilarating, direction. The film does take a unique and quite different turn in the final end showing a creation of monster attacks, similar to the original. The ending also does suggest there will be another sequel. Which can be quite forward looking towards.",8,0,0,21 December 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Excels on Performances
","3:10 to Yuma, Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is an Arizona rancher with a world of problems. He's got a bum leg from the war, his cattle are suffering from the drought, he's in debt to a man looking to sell his land to the railroads, and his 14-year-old son (Logan Lerman) doesn't respect him. Evans is given an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, however, when he witnesses the capture of Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), an infamous outlaw responsible for stealing over $400,000 in Pinkerton money and killing several along the way. Hoping to prolong the inevitable by earning some extra cash, Evans agrees to escort the prisoner – along with a Pinkerton (Dallas Roberts), a surly bounty hunter (Peter Fonda) and a veterinarian (Alan Tudyk) – to the town of Contention where Wade will board the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Considered a suicide mission by many, the odds are slimmed considerably with Wade's posse – led by his lunatic right-hand man, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) – hot on their trail.",7,1,2,2 October 2015
The Equalizer," Great Paced Action Film
","The Equalizer (2014). Better yet, fill the empty box with Denzel Washington – secure in his position, coolly cranking out box office hits – then dress it up a bit so it looks like it's about a few halfway relevant things, or even just one thing, or even just half of a thing. And if that half of a thing is Denzel Washington fighting the faces off of bad dudes with lumber and drills and his bare hands, then that's a good enough half of a thing.Washington is Robert McCall, a Boston man with a mysterious past. He lives quietly and works at a Home Depot-style store called 'Home Mart.' He's an insomniac, spending his nights reading classic literature in a 24-hour diner so Edward Hopper-ish that it might as well be named 'Nighthawks.' He reads The Old Man and The Sea. He reads Don Quixote. These titles are meant to convey the shape of his soul and the deeper themes a different film might explore. Aim well, movie; fill that box. As for a rewatch (02/25/17') this film is definitely more slower paced than one remembers. The action is there and far out within each other, and Denzel is great in this role. The Equalizer being compared to John Wick is quite accurate, both very similar films in tone and story. The Equalizer is still a solid slower paced action film.",7,0,1,18 May 2015
The Expendables 2," Action Filled Sequel that Delivers
","Now I enjoyed the original Expendables for what it was but I was felt disappointed in the outcome because of the way it was hyped up and I felt a lot of things could have made it better, and that things were missing. Now years later, watching the Expendables 2 and not having as such high expectations I went into the film excited and thrilled for surprises. I also did not read any reviews or check critics ratings upon watching. I found this to be greater than the original for many reasons. The plot was more focused, the characters were more detailed (we got to like them more), and mainly because of the more well directed intense action scenes.The film is separated into two parts. The first 45 or so minutes showing their plans on where to go. Focusing on Billy (Liam Hemsworth), and roughly the second half of the film is of course where we see his departure. Maggie steps in and takes a major role. I found both parts solid, yet the second half more interesting simply because we see the characters mesh more, and Arnold, Willis, and Chuck Noris get larger roles providing well in dept action and fight scenes.This is one of those few exceptions where the sequel is better than the original. The Expendables was quite serviceable in my opinion, but it never really lived up to the potential of what could have been with the dream team cast it touted. This time however The Expendables take on a whole new attitude. The violence is more non stop and well delivered by the camera shots, there are more fight scenes, shootouts and the final battle fight between Stallone and Van Damme. However one thing I could have done with out is the several references to past 80's action films (Arnold saying 'I'm back!/ Yippie- Ki-yay/Who's next-- Rambo!', etc). Mainly because his delivery was flat. Other than that, the Expendables 2 is a solid action thrilled popcorn film and delivers for its time being. We will see how the Expendables 3 turns out!",8,6,7,11 October 2013
War Dogs," Performances elevate film
","War Dogs seemingly came and went, though the film wasn't a box office success like Todd Philips previous films, this film has a very different feel, in a good way and is entertaining throughout. Most specify the performances from both leads, especially Jonah Hill portraying a young character in which he has played similar before. For his reasons, the film elevates and feels better given the performance.Another reason as to why this film is quite entertaining is the subject matter, as it's rougly based on a true story, which is quite eye opening to us whom are unfamiliar to these type of elements. Although quite predictable within the end, War Dogs is still an engaging watch and better than expected.",8,0,1,13 July 2018
The Longest Yard," Entertaining and serves its purpose
","As an Adam Sandler film, the Longest Yard serves its purpose as an entertaining action comedy. Having not seen the original film and solely basing it on this remake. It has its moments and the film isn't meant to be taken overly serious. Some casual moments of humor, decent sports action though the story is quite predictable.",7,1,1,23 February 2020
Source Code," Sci-Fi Thriller
","Source Code is a grabber of a premise, and Gyllenhaal is well cast as the unprepared observer trying to understand what's happened to him (the last thing he knew, he was flying a helicopter in Afghanistan) while being forced to repeat those same eight minutes over and over. Eventually, he decides to deviate from the program and try to save the life of a fellow passenger (Michelle Monaghan), even though she's already died in the bombing.Source Code's themes are similar to those in director Duncan Jones's previous film, Moon, and it has many of the same flaws: once again, he lays out the clues to key plot points so laboriously that we can figure them out ahead of the characters, and the naive existentialism falls apart if you think about it for any length of time. It is a film in which you must pay attention to properly understand the concept. It's watchable in spite of itself, and Gyllenhaal and Monaghan are great together. Source Code delivers the necessary thrills and suspense one would look to enjoy in a thriller. Although the film moves pretty quickly making the time go by rapid. It could have been a little longer in length. ==================================================================== ====== 
After a rewatch (03/01/17'), this film is more than great this time around. There are more subliminals and I had a better understanding of the film's concept in whole this time around. Source Code is a well crafted thriller and the short runtime (1hr, 33mins) works quite well in its favor. It allows every moment to be crucial and everything happening is quite important as the film doesn't drag or include any unnecessary or unwanted subplots that we are used to seeing in other films like this. The cast is great and everything is well connected in the end. Source Code reminded more of Edge of Tomorrow in a sense, as well as Unknown with Liam Neeson. Overall, this film is one of the greatest sci-fi films of this decade and is highly recommended, rating change to 9/10. On another rewatch 09/02/18' Source Code remains fresh and intriguing on multiple watches. Highly recommend for those still in the dark having not seen this film.",9,0,0,26 May 2013
50 First Dates," Interesting Premise could have been better
","Adam Sandler stars as Henry Roth, the leading man whose womanizing ways change when he falls for a younger girl Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore. The concept of the film is relatively simply but it is quite interesting, how the film could have been (for better or for worse) seems to be cut from the same cloth as the lame line of humor, but the romance story that develops around the idea actually achieves a certain level of charm. A major reason why Adam Sandler comes off fairly well in the film is the rest of the cast simply stay out of Barrymore's way whenever she appears; her effortlessly beguiling performance generates both smiles and genuine poignance. The ending is quite unique but it makes sense in the way. All together, 50 First Dates is a decent watch for Sandler fans, and those of mysterious romantic comedies.",6,1,1,16 August 2016
The Hangover," very entertaining and pretty funny
","So I decided to watch the Hangover on the internet today because I've heard many great reviews and claims that this movie is one of the funniest of 09'. Well I gotta agree, i haven't seen many movies in 09' but this was pretty funny. Although it honestly could have been funnier, I didn't laugh all the way through the movie like others claim to say. I laughed at many moments but I was expecting more. The beginning was kind of weird but towards the middle and through the end, it was hilarious and got good. So much funny and weird things that normally wouldn't happen, do happen. So it starts with the four friends (Phil, Stu, Alan, Doug) going to Vegas to celebrate Doug getting married. Then when there at Vegas for a while, they all witness the worst hangover of their lives. When they wake up, they literally cant remember anything...there is a tiger in the bathroom, Stu loses a tooth, a baby in the closet, and other weird things including them stealing a cop car, Mike Tyson makes a funny cameo, an accidental marriage, and many more. Id highly recommend watching this film, go rent it or watch it on the web like I did..her's the link: http:// www.free- TV- video-online.info/player/zshare. php?id=71542802bf1e2d12 (I had to space it out because it didn't allow the link in full..erase the spaces when copying the link in the URL box..thanks). As a rewatch 04/05/18') and after over 8 years of rewatching in full, opinions remain about the same. The Hangover remains a great and entertaining watch. Knowing the twist ending made it less appealing but on a rewatch, was more understood and picked up clues and hints had not noticed in original viewing. As another rewatch 05/30/19' The Hangover remains one of the rare comedies which has stood the test of time.",9,1,2,30 January 2010
Iron Man 3," Ties the Storyline with Solid Action
","Iron Man 3 the sequel to the very successful Iron Man films. However and almost certainly so, Iron Man 3 is not as good as the first Iron Man film, but better than the second. Iron Man 3 though, it works well enough. Now onto it, Iron Man 3 starts off with a flashback to Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) earlier youth days. At a 1999 party, Stark crosses paths with two men and a woman who would later have a profound influence on his life, Ho Yinsen who would later save his life and inspire him to become a super hero, Maya Hansen, a scientist whose research would come back to haunt him, and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who would later become Stark's deadly enemy. In a voice-over narration, Stark talks about the momentous events he carelessly set in motion that day years ago.Now fast forward to several years in the present day Stark's life is picked up, along with others from the previous films, including Pepper Potts and Happy Hogan (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jon Favreau). Stark has settled down with Potts and Hogan is now head of security for Stark's company.Later onto the film, we are introduced to a megalomaniac named The Mandarin, whom is causing havoc with assassinations, kidnappings and bombings. When Happy is injured in one of these bombings, he becomes a target for Iron Man. In response to a media question, Stark issues a direct challenge to the Mandarin and, giving his home address out to the media, invites him to do his worst.Iron Man 3 has it's ups and downs but overall the film works for the chemistry and charisma of Robert Downey Jr., along with Gwyneth Paltrow. The action sequences are well shot, and the visuals are stunning as we are introduced to more of the Iron Man suits, which are visually compelling as a wholesome. However, the villains could have been better, while they were their it did not have a sense of Tony Stark being in any kind of real danger.

","Deepwater Horizon is apparently based on the true real life events of The Deepwater Horizon oil spill which occurred in 2010. This was both a financial disaster for BP, and an ongoing environmental catastrophe. Reportedly an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled out into the Gulf of Mexico over the 87 days that it took to plug the hole, leaving the sea a blackened wasteland of dead and diseased.Based upon real people Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) routinely boards the rig, leaves his wife (Kate Hudson) and daughter on shore. On board the Deepwater Horizon, Mike and Mr. Jimmy (Kurt Russell) bode ill tidings when they discover that the departing drill team left without doing a safety check on the hole. This film is entertaining at certain moments but as a whole, one must be invested in the type of film this is, which is a real based true events disaster film. With a large budget of over $110 million and only making over $120 million worldwide, this film did not make as much as the studios hoped for, or was not praised as much either, as they intended some Oscar nominations. Overall Deepwater Horizon has its moments but as a whole is quite boring, which is shameful because the film is quite well made and we can notice much research was done. The main problem is that they waited a few years too long to make and release this film, which is a reason for its flopping at the box office. As a rewatch 06/17/20 opinions remain same. The film starts off relatively slow as it builds then gets quite engaging. Overall the story as tragic of a disaster as it has been doesn't quite provide such an interesting tale.",6,1,2,21 June 2017
Deja Vu," Entertaining throughout and Unpredictable
","Deja Vu starring Denzel Washington as a federal agent looking for clues in the aftermath of a bombing. Washington is convinced that one victim (Paula Patton) is linked to the villain, but he's not sure how. Washington's character is invited to become part of a new investigative team (along with Val Kilmer) that uses experimental technology. As he attempts to solve a crime, our protagonist ends up falling for and stumbles across an unusual solution to finding a killer. The film is well written, and has a lot of material that we rarely see in such high profile blockbuster films in this day and age.Throughout the film, it is quite fairly biblical in its themes of redemption and resurrection. The story is a stretch, to be sure, but the storytelling is crisp and engaging. What makes Deja Vu a great popcorn film, is not only the acting from Denzel, but the overall storytelling of the film. It is entertaining throughout, there are many hidden clues and most importantly the film us unpredictable.",9,0,0,17 January 2017
It," Intriguing blend of horror and comedy
","Having little interest in watching this film when it was released, and only now watching for the first time two years later. Having no knowledge about the initial story based upon the novels or mini series, judging the film based on its own merit.The opening scene is quite good and sets a strong tone for the rest of the film. A lot of complaints seem to be about that the film isn't that scary. Well it is a type of horror which has great visuals and many jump scares.Several people seemed to have found Pennywise the clown to be more goofy, silly and over the top than completely terrifying, though found it intriguing none the less. Although the graphic design of the clown is well done along with the overall texture and cinematography. The CGI is noticeable but it works.The kids do a solid realistic portrayal, although there is plenty of cursing from the kids (more than expected and it seemed to get more as the film went on). It was noticeable, especially by Richie.'IT' is quite lengthy and doesn't feel too long since something is always happening but at some parts do seem to stall and drag on (the 'well' scene for instance). This film does live up to the hype and as a genre does a solid job at not being too horrifying, while also having some comic relief.",7,0,0,22 September 2019
Minority Report," Thought provoking and Engaging
","Minority Report starring Tom Cruise and directed by Steven Spielberg is one of the more creative and visually stunning sci-fi films of several recent years, since it's release. The results: completed murders have become non-existent. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, the head of the Pre-Crime unit. Anderton sorts through the images that come from the psychics in order to try and pin down the location of the future crime. When he sorts through the latest set of images and discovers that he is the one pulling the trigger, the chase is on. Anderton tries to find some way to prove his innocence while his former allies find themselves chasing one of their own. Anderton is convinced that someone has tampered with the system, which brings him to the doorstep of the creator of the system. He discovers that his only hope is to secure the minority report, a sort of dissenting opinion from one of the psychics that could clear his name. Minority Report is very thoughtful and creative and has seen praised over the years. As many as seen, the film does take upon serious issues and different wide of topics. At one point there are so many ads running at once that it's impossible to understand anything being said. If you think getting spam e-mail is bad, this will make you fear what the future has in store. There are a few missteps in the film, though in the end everything appears to be concluded in well manner that ties everything. After a rewatch 08/20/17' Minority Report remains an incredible and thought provoking sci-fi film.",10,0,0,19 June 2016
Training Day," Police crime drama classic
","Training Day, Denzel Washington pulls out all the stops and delivers a performance. Written by David Ayer and directed by Anthony Fuqua, Training Day grabs you. While the ending suffers from an overload of coincidences and contrivances, the movie still packs a wallop as it asks the question: Can honorable men deal with the worst of humanity on a daily basis without being corrupted?Co-starring Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a Los Angeles cop out to become detective. To that end, he tries to join an elite squad led by Alonzo Harris (Washington), an undercover officer legendary for his effectiveness. The hitch is that Jake has only one day to prove his worthiness to Alonzo. Even within his drug haze, the boy soon realizes that Alonzo is not merely an officer that plays fast and loose with the rules - he's a full-fledged rogue cop willing to do anything to get what he wants.Some of the most harrowing moments take place in a neighborhood completely under the control of thugs. Alonzo lives there, convinced he is respected by his brutal neighbors due to his ability to work the system. In fact, they loathe the man and put up with him solely because of his badge and gun.Taking place over the course of a single day, Training Day builds momentum and never backs off. The film creates and maintains a sense of genuine danger. As the proceedings grow ever more dark, you begin to wonder if the key players can possibly survive the day. Until the last 15 minutes, that is, when the story wraps up too quickly and in far too pat a fashion.",8,1,1,6 January 2016
In Bruges," Not what I was Expecting
","In Bruges is intended to be a comedy, but moreso a dark comedy. However, I didn't find it funny. It never occurred to me to laugh, or chuckle, or even smile. The dialog can be clever and witty but nothing gave the sense to laugh. The chemistry between the leads are good as it makes it somewhat interesting, but overall In Bruges suffers and feels all over the place.A plot hole near the end occurs when (a guy) gets shot in the carotid artery. He still has enough blood and energy left to climb up a bunch of steps and jump out of a window 250 feet high. After he lands on his head, squishing on the ground like a tomato, he still can talk and give instructions before he says, 'I think I'm going to die now.' On the positive side, it is filmed on location in Bruges, which is the most well-preserved medieval city in all of Belgium. The sites are beautiful but I wasn't blown away by the cinematography. Perhaps a second watch could renew my thoughts.",3,0,4,7 August 2014
John Wick," Lives Up to its Hype
","After hearing about the surrounded hype of John Wick, one must have been decided to see for themself how the film stacks up. And for one, I believe the film lives up to its hype. Having been called the best or one of the best action films of last year- 2014, it really does deliver on action and what makes the film standout, is the style and visuals. We have seen many action films in the past years but John Wick delivers and standouts due to its level of non-stop action and the way the action is being brought upon us. There have been plenty of action films with characters such as John Wick- highly secretive hit- man/detectives that play it cool, but in this film we see Keanu Reeves really play the part perfectly.Like most films, especially like he Equalizer- another 2014 action film, this film has a great set up and it builds the suspension, but as the film gets past half way, it really does become a great entertaining ride. Like many, the action is a serious tone and it works well. The sequel will be very anticipated, and we all hope it delivers. Keep a steady eye out for it. We all know it will come upon us quickly.",8,2,5,5 July 2015
Kung Fu Panda," Not really fresh, rather boring
","I found Kung Fu Panda to be rather boring and very typical. The plot has been done many times and the other times it were done better. I also found the jokes and gags in this film to be way too childish and immature. I know its meant for children and younger teens but this film just didn't seem that great, and it also sends a rather bad message. Kung Fu Panda brings us absolutely nothing new. Perhaps it's me getting older, but the humor nowadays feels very shallow in these animated movies. And the almost non-stop violence, because there really is. I don't mind action movies, or even martial arts movies but this is clearly a movie with intended major demographics in ages 8-12, and hopefully a sizeable number of high school kids so the music and animation must be perfected. The characters were okay. Jack Black was the right choice for Po, along with the other cast but overall the film was for the most part plain boring.",3,5,10,7 October 2010
A Star Is Born," Very solid depiction of Music fame
","Seeing as this film became a worldwide hit and has won several Oscars and other awards, knowing there was much hype but wasn't too interested in the film initially. After watching A star is Born, can see as to why this is as praised. The acting between both leads Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper carry the film along with their chemistry. As it felt authentic and genuine.The songs were decent enough to make a lasting impression (specially Shallows which won an Oscar and was a Billboard hit).Though the first acts were really good and captivating, the film somewhat went downhill around the point the manager was introduced and around Jackson and Ally got married.Knowing that this was a rename of previous versions (though haven't seen any of them) but knew about the tragic ending. Think it was well shot and was a good job at not making the suicide too tragic looking. Was a solid finale ending. In the end, A star is born was as expected (if not slightly better) but did not completely love the film.",8,1,1,5 August 2019
Gravity," Visual Stunning
","As many Oscar best picture nominated films, and winners, Gravity excels due to its technical aspect of the film. Where in other places it does not, it exceeds because of how visually stunning and memorizing the scenery is. High quality global journalism requires investment. Starring Sandra Bullock, we see her as she gives us a calamity dame for a crisis, bravery battling adversity, hysteria and a fitfully firing backstory about a dead daughter.Director and co-writer Alfonso Cuarón, a space novice self-launched after a career in terrestrial drama and fantasy, brings an innocent's freshness to the genre. The 3D is most brilliantly unnerving when most seemingly trivial. The weightless hazard-objects that float past our faces in cabins – a torch, fork, spanner – mimic and prefigure the bigger bric-a-brac to come. In the end we are witnessed to a more so predicable take but as it works for the best.",7,1,2,3 March 2015
Lone Survivor," Brutal and Realistic
","As many war films have surfaced along the years, Lone Survivor is one of the better depictions of true events. Lone Survivor stands as an outstanding account of bravery and comradeship under fire, with acts of selflessness abounding. And director Berg (Friday Night Lights) could not have presented it more humanistically, or with more compassion for those who gave their lives on a mission that was doomed from the start. As it observes one of the four SEALS originally dropped onto Sawtalo Sar, the rugged mountain near Asadabad where insurgent leader Ahmad Shah was believed to be commanding a large band of Taliban fighters. 'No curse,' Luttrell replies, 'just Afghanistan.' But cursed they were, as Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg) and fellow SEALs Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster) and their leader, Michael Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), encounter nothing but horrible luck after confirming Shah's presence. As a rewatch 06/18/20' this film remains an entertaining and thought provoking true based war drama. Lone Survivor is up there with Patriots Day among Peter Berg's top films.",8,27,46,7 January 2015
Wind River," Slow overlooked thriller
","Wind River's director Taylor Sheridan follows up his acclaimed screenplays for of 2016 Hell or High Water and 2015 Denis Villeneuve's Sicario with his first directorial effort.. Wind River is another modern-day western, full of tense action and tough, taciturn characters trying to navigate life on the fringes of America. But if Sicario and especially Hell or High Water explored the damaging legacy of the frontier myth on a country that's rigged to favor the few, then Wind River makes the connection more forceful, set as it is on a Native American reservation that's been left to its own devices with none of the infrastructure necessary to let its inhabitants thrive. The film opens with the death of a young woman. Discovered miles from anywhere in the frozen wilds of Wyoming's Wind River reservation, she's found and identified by Jeremy Renner (Cory Lambert), a game tracker with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. He knows the girl, knows her family, knows that something horrifying must have forced this Native American teenager to run barefoot through the night until her lungs packed up. Wind River may be considered slow and boring for many as the film isn't the typical crime drama, though within the second half of the film, it picks up and becomes completely engaging. The acting from the cast is what sells the film, as well as the cinematography of the outdoors. The shots are well done. Although somewhat of a predictable mystery as we see the film descend, the second act of the film makes up for it. Recommend.",7,0,1,26 July 2018
Meet the Parents," Delivers on Comedy Tense
","Meet The Parents (2000) introduces Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam with silly quirks that come up later in the story. Pam's parents are also quite the treat; the movie does not go over the top but portrays them with serious humor and charismatic wit. It is DeNiro and Stiller who make the movie, however. The filmmakers take advantage of the phenomenal tension between Greg and Jack, and place them in one hilarious situation after another. The more Stiller gets in trouble, the more painful it gets, the better Stiller gets, the more the audience laugh. There is also a part from Owen Wilson. Stiller and Wilson have made a lot of films together as their scenes always work. The way we see DeNiro slowly gets harder and harder on Greg is timely pacing among the directors choice decision.",8,2,2,7 February 2015
Se7en," Quite gripping and disturbing
","Se7en is one of David Fincher's most known and praised work as a director. This film has seemingly been praised since it's release in 1995 and appears to hold up in today's day. The film is quite dark, violent and disturbing at times. The suspense is there but overall the end twist really isn't as creative as one was lead to believe.We can see as to why this film is as praised, as it does have an interesting feel and makes one feel like they're on the edge of their seats, but the end result isn't as great.Very good movie but it is quite overrated by the masses. Did not find the end twist as clever or creative as most are taking it.*SPOILERS* The setup deaths by John Doe were clever but once he eventually turns himself in to the detective at the station, it doesn't feel that clever or unpredictable. The ending was more so a 'shock value' ending than a very 'clever/never before seen' twist ending. Him claiming to have cut off the head of Brad Pitt's character's wife and have it packaged to them in a box wasn't clever, just more so shocking (And of course we actually don't see the head in the box as it is never shown).Overall, Se7en is worth the watch for the performances, the set up deaths and atmosphere as a whole but overall, the film isn't as great as wildly considered.",7,2,2,23 May 2019
The Big Lebowski," Highly considered but not as great
","The Big Lebowski has become a cult classic type film as the years have went, and has been praised from fans and critics over the years. Described and given a breakthrough performance from leads Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, as well as sharp directing from the Coen brothers. The film is a comedy in nature but a lot of it isn't as funny as described. There are some decent moments and some comedy comes from the chemistry of the characters but overall, not many laughs. As the dialogue is filled with a heavy amount of constant F-bombs, it becomes cluttered, also with much of The Dude's dialogue's consisting of 'dude' or 'man'. We do get used to it but it becomes annoying. The storyline is there but as watching the film, there felt as if something was quite missing as it was not as great as originally thought upon. Perhaps this is one of those films where it gets better on multiple viewings and for certain acquired tastes.",5,4,9,6 February 2018
Unbreakable," Thoughtful and Suspensing
","Unbreakable is an early 2000 film from the director M. Night Shyamalan. Starring Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a security guard distanced from his wife (Robin Wright Penn) to the distress of their son (Spencer Treat Clark). Returning from a job interview in New York he emerges unscathed from a train wreck which kills everyone else aboard. Willis' escape catches the eye of Elijah Price, a wealthy dealer in comic-book art (Samuel L Jackson) who is a victim of a rare bone disease that causes his limbs to fracture at the slightest jolt. Elijah has an unsettling theory about David's miraculous escape from the train wreck, and a curious friendship develops.Back into his early career, Shyamalan has shown himself to be an outstanding master of atmosphere and a riveting storyteller. Unbreakable holds the attention from its first moments, an opening sequence with Bruce Willis on the train, the restlessness of the camera implying a sense of foreboding. However, the ending is less than great which is what brings the film as a whole to be less greater than what it should have been.",7,0,1,1 May 2016
Fury," Dull and Overlong
","Fury is another well directed, well written war film based on real events, directed by David Ayer (End of Watch, Sabotage). Starting off as a different take, the film does take a while for the initial plot to take it. Norman Ellison (Logan Lehrman) has been hooked out of the secretarial pool, where his skills included typing up to 60 words per minute, and shoved into a profane environment where his first job is clearing the remains of the unit's last driver out of the tank. His companions are archetypal warriors: pious 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf) is the main, 'Coon-Ass' (Jon Bernthal) is the tank's belligerent loader, while 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Peña) is the driver. The ending may come as a surprise to some, however the film ends in a way which does take from its lead for the cause. Overall, Fury does not excite much, although the acting is well done from the cast, there have been more war films (in recent memory- Lone Survivor) which have more entertainment.",3,3,11,4 November 2015
Fight Club," Unique and quite captivating
","Having always heard and being familiar about Fight Club and somewhat hearing little by little its twist ending (but not completely knowing the full details), and only now watching the film for the first time 21+ years later its release. Understood its high praise from fans, and as to why many consider it one of the favorite films among one of the greatest films of all time.Fight Club most definitely seems to be a film which caters towards the teens to 20/early 30's crowd of people. From the directing to the acting, to the dialogue and scenery, everything is done in a very stylish and 'cool' sort of way. The entire film has that factor which is appealing and engaging to many people (including oneself).Everything which has been said and praised about the film has already been said. From the twist (which is somewhat confusing but also in a way predictable), but its keeps it engaging throughout. The film does start off really well, then comes a little downhill in its second half (around the time the 'Project Mayhem' is introduced) but it's still enjoyable, and the twist is enjoyable to see it unfold.The performances of both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt alone are what make this movie worth the watch. Both of them on screen (especially Pitt) are highly captivating. Helena Bonham Carter also does a solid job, and Meat Loaf also stands out.From the surface level, this film may seem like it's only about fighting and a group of men gathering in groups to fight one another in underground settings. But given that it is based on a novel (not many people are aware), the little subtle intangibles are quite clever and keeps people guessing. It is more complex than most may initially suspect. Also the fact there are many different theories about certain parts/things of the film, tells us that this is more than a film simply about fighting.For a film to be over 20 years old, and still people are commenting/reviewing and discussing it, tells us that it is a classic and one of the most well known and popular films. This is a film which stays with you after watching it and may still be one your mind a day or so later. As more time passes, we assume the next generation will watch the film for the first time, and have similar opinions and thoughts. Perhaps Fight Club was ahead of it's time released in 1999.",9,0,0,10 May 2020
Memento," Mindblowing Thriller
","Memento a film that needs multiple viewings. Memento not only warrants second, third and more viewings but actively encourages them. Like 'The Usual Suspects' you get to the end and think you have found the answer to what happened, what you have just spent two hours watching, but the more you analyse it the less certain you are. You really will end up thinking 'Now, where was I?' Characters' moral ambiguity become clearer with each viewing so that you can end up convinced that everyone in the world is totally messed up and utterly lacking a morality of any real kind.Pearce makes another great screen character come to life off the script (see 'LA Confidential' and 'Priscilla' for others), Joe Pantoliano is a creature of demonlike charm, and Carrie Moss. Her role as Natalie is pivotal to the audience's realisation that this movie is deliberately playing with their head.There are very few films that offer an experience as engrossing as this, although it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person that likes to work things out for yourself using the available evidence (just like Leonard) then this is for you. If you like your movies to be clear cut and easy to understand on the original viewing, this may not be to your taste. As a rewatch 03/13/20' Memento remains one of the greater films as it is complex and at times hard to follow, but once understood, this film is a great piece of cinema.",10,0,4,31 October 2013
This Is the End," One of The Funniest Films in a While
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, as co-writers and co-directors adapting director Jason Stone's short, capture denial as coping mechanism in the face of the unimaginable, while also satirizing stardom, poking fun at rich-stoner foibles and, generating genuine dread and despair. For all its visual effects' evidently low-budget seams, and with full acknowledgment of gross-out moments that make this movie not for everyone, This Is the End is masterful comedy film making, all the more impressive for its loose-limbed apparent casualness.With all the stars playing fictional versions of themselves, Baruchel and Rogen—friends since at least Judd Apatow's cult-classic TV series 'Undeclared' and since then part of Apatow's informal movie repertory company—attend a party at James Franco's concrete mansion in L.A. There, the guest roster includes Craig Robinson, a suspiciously obsequious Jonah Hill, Michael Cera—depicted as a gold-plated jerk who feels up Rihanna, getting punched in the process, and blowing a cloud of cocaine into the face of non-user Christopher Mintz-Plasse—along with Mindy Kaling, David Krumholtz, Martin Starr, Paul Rudd, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari and Jason Segel in cameos. When suddenly faced with what they think is just an unusually destructive earthquake that's spawned fires and a huge sinkhole, most of them die in the ensuing everyone-for- themselves panic and the aforesaid sinkhole.Franco, Hill, Robinson, Baruchel and Rogen survive and barricade themselves, as Baruchel, who was in a convenience store with Rogen when the earthquake hit, describes seeing people borne up into the skies in rays of blue light. At first no one believes him—Rogen had been covered with detritus from the tremor and saw nothing—but by the time some neighbor begging to be let in gets decapitated and evidently eaten by some growling thing outside, a growing sense of infinitely terrible possibilities takes hold. Then Danny McBride, whom no one knew had shown up invited, appears the next morning behaving pretty much like his on screen persona in HBO's Eastbound & Down, which is to say of the first order—while an ax-wielding Emma Watson proves surprisingly. 'Hermione just stole all of our (food),' McBride deadpans to a confessional camera recording their last days. As pointed out McBride steals the show here, every scene he is in is a pleasure to watch, including his back and forth conversation with Franco. I feel that the film goes somewhat down hill once he leaves. The ending was not too great, although unpredictable. This is the End is a great comedy definitely not for everyone's comedic taste. If you are a fan of Seth Rogen type comedies (Pineapple Express, Knocked Up), I don't see how one would be left completely disappointed (at least not to have several laughs).",9,2,9,19 August 2014
Dawn of the Dead," Engaging and thrilling zombie movie
","Relatively simple and thoughtful zombie movie. The story in Dawn of the Dead is quite simple enough and the characters blend in with the action as well as decent scares. More so of an action film than a typical horror film, and it works well.After having watched 28 Weeks Later, and founding that decent. Had relatively higher expectations about Dawn of the Dead and the expectations were met. Similar films but there is much more action, gore violence and rather cheesy effects and dialogue making Dawn more engaging. Overall a very well done zombie film as it delivers on different aspects and it works.",9,1,1,20 February 2020
Iron Man 2," Not really worth it
","I watched Iron Man 2 earlier today and I found it quite boring and annoying. I am not a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. but I liked the original Iron Man. Personally I found this film boring because of the lack of action and the amount of talking. Also another mistake of the movie was letting Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard. Cheadle and Downey Jr. did not have the same great chemistry like Howard and Downey Jr. And Iron Man's character is very weird in this. For example their a scene where's he's at a party in his suit. That was very awkward to watch.The story is also very predictable and well not that great. While watching I was also very confused throughout the movie. I liked the villain he was cool enough but other characters were annoying like Scarlett Johanson and that other girl. Iron Man (2008) was great because they didn't overreact with the story, I just didn't really like this movie. Granted it had some good moments but not enough for me",3,3,6,10 July 2010
World War Z," Lacking of Scares in Zombie Apocalypse
","Rarely have we seen zombie films work in the process of the film. And rarely do PG-13 zombie films work. The audience are rarely given a chance to focus on what has just happened, or to absorb key plot points. Instead we jump from one scene to another. Coherence is lost. Impact is lost. Someone must have left scenes on the cutting room floor.In one scene, a character with key information is quickly dismissed from the film in a manner that was underwhelming and farcical. At this point I did a double take, looked around the cinema to see if anyone else was as bemused, and carried on watching. The confused frown never fully left my face. Of the few strengths in the film, one must highlight Marco Beltrami's score that bounds behind the opening credits.",4,0,0,7 October 2015
Passengers," Interesting premise falls short
",As a sci-fi film Passengers is quite visually stunning and the effects make the film look great due to its $110 million budget. Not as great as hyped up to be. There are sone decent moments but the film turns more so into a romantic comedy/drama than an intense mysterious type a I do film. Much of the film is very much predictable.,5,0,2,15 September 2019
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Had its moments but nothing special
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall is basically another film Judd Apatow produced comedy with a roundabout of the same humor. This stars Jason Segel (surprisingly good) as a guy who's desperately heartbroken after a break-up and needs to refresh his whole life, and so he decides to go to Hawaii to seek out new interest.Now, I never go into a comedy with high hopes, because I always end up disappointed - luckily, with this I got myself a good laugh. It's standard procedure sure, and the film does lend heavily on the romantic button at several occasions, but still there's lots to laugh at when mentioned Segel, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. There were a few laughs, some minor some rather bigger but not enough for it too be that great. The females were played out by Kristen Bell and the sweet Mila Kunis, does only provide positively for the issues regarding romance, and not for the issues regarding comedy or mildly affecting drama, note: mildly. Their were some real awkward scenes and some other good scenes. One thing that was weird is how everywhere he went, Sarah Marshall was their. First he goes to Hawaii to forget about her, and he ends up running into her. Then, he rents a room and it ends up being the room right next to her. Weird and sorta unrealistic? Also he goes for a yoga class and she and Aldous Snow is there. Then he later goes to dinner and she's right there in front of him. Very strange. Also since she's a TV star, her show was usually on TV when he was watching. He couldn't get her out of his mind.One thing that was weird was her character, she didn't seem that mean but they explained that she broke up his 5+ year relationship and during the last year, she was sleeping with Aldous. I though her character (Sarah Marshall) could have been meaner and more of a b****. Perhaps Kristen Bell wasn't the right choice. The ending was also really weird. She started having feelings for him again and likewise with him but he like Mila Kunis (Rachel) she he ended up getting with her. Not that surprising but somewhat surprising. Overall it was a decent movie, I enjoyed at parts it but it could have been better! After a rewatch (03/31/17') this film is more well rounded and the writing is quite good, more so of a mature comedy than what we are used to seeing in past years (such as Adam Sandler films). Rating changed from 6/10 to 7/10. For another watch 06 26 19' this film remains an enjoyable and at times funny film. Although somewhat unrealistic there are enough decent and watchable moments.",7,1,4,2 August 2010
12 Monkeys," Overly confusing
","Expected a great movie based on reviews and the overall current IMDB rating and critics ratings, but what was watched wasn't something did not completely expect. This film is quite confusing and for no reason, as it does have an interesting premise but overall it is rather boring at times. Not bashing the acting, but do not think it is as great as its been praise.Bruce Willis is seemingly playing a role he has played before, and Brad Pitt was far over the top and seemed to phone it in. Seeing a lot of strong phrases such as 'masterpiece' or 'classic' brought upon this film, but after watching did not feel the same way. Was just not impressed. Also this film feels very outdated watching it in today's times.",4,2,4,20 June 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Do not understand the appeal
","The current IMDB rating of this film is 7.9 and it has received a lot of praise from critics. However after watching this movie and seeing some critics and fans claiming how funny or 'bloody brilliant' it is, do not get as to how.Found this film very dull, and generic. The humor is more quirky and nothing is laugh out loud as people keep mentioning. There are some decent scenes of gore towards the end but nothing special.Having enjoyed zombie movies, one does not understand as to how this film has received the mass praise it has gotten.As a film nothing exactly is explained. We simply see the zombies appear without any reasoning, then the characters don't exactly freak out until one one their loved ones gets bitten and turn into a zombie. We understand this film is a spoof but it just wasn't clicking.Shaun of the Dead is filled with annoying characters (outside of Simon Pegg), with a lot of back and forth banter and dialogue. The best scenes are within the last 30 minutes but even then it was relatively dull.Perhaps this is one of those films loved by British folks who are accustomed to their humor.",2,0,1,16 May 2020
Argo," Well Crafted but Lacking
","Argo is the third film in which Ben Afflect director and it won the 2013 Best Pictur at the Academy Awards. Having known of the film's success and critical praise, I was interested in finally watching. Argo is a Political Biography drama centered towards real live events. Argo opens with a breathless re-creation of the November 4, 1979, storming of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, in which 52 Americans were taken hostage by revolutionary forces. Everyone knows what happened to them over the following 444 days.Ben Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, the real-life CIA operative and ex- filtration specialist who concocted the improbable solution. His idea was to fly into Iran by himself and fly out with the six refugees posing as a Canadian film crew scouting Middle Eastern locations for a low- budget Star Wars rip-off called Argo. The plot is relatively simple but it is how the film is executed which is what is entertaining. Argo doesn't hold back and we see the raw glimpses of the real world, the directing is top notch along with the acting from the cast.Argo is a mix of political thriller and Hollywood satire. Maybe I was expecting more but Argo somewhat tends to drag along the way as it took me out of the overall enjoyment. It is very well done in its technical aspects but I wasn't too intrigued with the story. The film isn't too long as it feels appropriate. Argo is a specific film for a certain audience, and not everyone will enjoy it.",6,1,1,11 December 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Different type of Romantic Comedy
","Crazy, Stupid, Love was a mild success at the box office due to it's ensemble cast and clever trailer. The film is a romantic comedy but not as much as the typical soppy ones where it first starts off as a somewhat innocent typical comedy then shifts towards romantic and finally more so depressing and expressive. This is a decent film and quite entertaining due to the cast, lead by Steve Carell (playing a similar character as he did in the 40 year old virgin) and Ryan Gosling who arguable steals the film. The other lead characters of Julianne Moore and Emma Stone come off as completely unlikable, but eventually get better as the film progresses.Containing with several flaws, such as the wife Emily played by Julianne Moore wanting to get a divorce from Steve Carell's character Cal because she cheated on him, after being married for over 20 years was sketchy. It was a surprise as it was the first scene in which it occurred,but as the film progresses we realize it was only her character going through a midlife crisis and did not actually want a divorce. The film contains other subplots, one which dragged on too long and dragged the quality of the film down. Which involves their 13 year old and their babysitter. This subplot folds towards the end but it was easily the weakest link and wasn't funny, sweet or all that interesting. At fist it was okay, but seeing as it became an entire subplot and part of the film held it down. The best scenes are the ones involving Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell together, with Gosling teaching Carell his ways of picking up woman at the bar, simply because the comedy is loose, and it's refreshing. Their chemistry is what made the film.Crazy, Stupid, Love has its moments since it is quite a long film but a lot of the film appears to be as a fairy tale and very coincidental. Such as Cal successfully being able to attract Marisa Tomei's character then later finding out she is their son's teacher at a parent conference meeting (when the meeting appeared to be at the end of the semester- since the son was about to graduate). It's plausible but a little sketchy that the parents would just now be meeting with their child's teacher that late in the semester. (Spoiler) The other coincidental is of course the concluding twist in the near finale of the film. This was well executed but very coincidental and far fetched but played well. Involves Ryan Gosling's character of Jacob appearing to fall for Emma Stone's character then turning out that she is the daughter of Steve Carell. This scene appears within the last 30 minutes of the film at their backyard when everything comes into place and is well played for laughs. Elevates the film from that point on. Otherwise this film isn't as great as considered but overall one can tell why this film did well with critics and movie goers as it isn't a completely typical rom-com but a bit depressing and very honest in the least bit.",6,1,2,9 July 2017
Happy Gilmore," Enjoyable Older Sandler film
","Happy Gilmore is an early film of Adam Sandler's during his 1990's era. The spirit of the film and the title character played by Sandler are every bit as enjoyable as many have considered this film to be. Happy is the ultimate chip-on-his-shoulder leading man, who settles every argument with a punch in the nose or a biting wisecrack. He has a short fuse which is shown that the slightest spark can set him off, occasionally with great results. He is a lifelong hockey fan, and he wants desperately to play with the pros, but he has one problem which is he can't skate. However after one day occasionally fooling around with golf with a few friends, he is noticed by former gold legend Chubbs. From there on, Chubbs tells him that Happy is a great and has talent, though Happy doesn't want any part of golf since his goal is to become a hockey player. Happy Gilmore does have several decent laughs and Adam Sandler plays the character as needed. For a comedy the plot works well enough and the pacing is good. It isn't too long and it is quite enjoyable for those of fans of this sort of comedy. As a rewatch 02/27/20' Happy Gilmore remains an enjoyable and fun positive watch.",8,2,2,9 August 2016
The Notebook," When things settle in, they click
","The Notebook has been considered for many one of the more best selling Nicholas Sparks adaptation films within the last decade and one of the more polarizing romance films. Opening back in 2004, the film was not as much of a hit back then but quickly became to be a bigger film as the years have passed. The first half of the film is quite shaky as we see the introductions of the characters, and the story settling in. We watch it, knowing it must get better and as the second half approaches (about an hour in- once we see Ryan Goslin's character Noah with a beard), the film picks up a lot of momentum and becomes very entertaining and quite a thrilling watch. We can see why this movie has been praised by film goers through the years, though it does have its clichés although they do not get too much in the way of the story. Although predictable (as are most love stories), what works about the Notebook is the ending and the way the film is told within it's storytelling.This film has been described by many as 'The Titanic' of the 2000's, and that may be accurate as far as best selling/romance love adaptation book stories. Overall depending on your expectations, this film may not be as cheesy or lovey as one would expect. The chemistry and performances of the leads, along with the storytelling is what set this film apart from other films of the genre.",8,1,2,14 July 2017
Us," Interesting premise works
","The highly anticipated follow up to Jordan Peele's directorial film, Us has received much hype and praise from critics. Having a very well box office debut, the film seemed to have become bigger than Get Out in its first week. The film is quite well done, with a creative and interesting premise.The trailers do the film justice as we can see what it is based up. With several jump scares and an overall tone that has a great message, the film isn't too horror as one expected.Much of the film is interesting in that we are wondering as to what will occur next and are wanting to see where it goes. There does seem to be several plot twists in the end, yet some negative reviews are claiming that there are 'plot holes'.'Us' is more than a great horror film, there are key subtle clues in the beginning which makes the film worthwhile and a must watch. Worth the hype and wait.",7,2,7,27 March 2019
The Girl Next Door," Pretty good teen movie
","The Girl Next Door is a pretty entertaining movie. It has many scenes that are hard not to watch and that make you interested in the unravelling of the film. Though it also got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while. Emile Hirsh is the central character Matthew Kidman, about to graduate from high school. The girl next door is Elisha Cuthbert is the title character, Danielle. Her character acts very differently from the beginning to the end of the film. She changes quite drastically in personality and its quite good yet odd in a way. Also it was quite strange how at first from meeting Matthew the way she acts with him. It seemed like she was just using him, but as we see throughout the film she does end up liking him. Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny though also contains a few dramatic scenes (many involving Matthew & Kelly, and Matthew & Danielle- a strip club scene). Also I found many of the characters to be quite annoying, specifically Matthew's two friends- Eli and Klitz, and Kelly (he was very crude and weird). I feel the writers made his character too over-the-top. There are also some weird and quite odd scenes (Matthew's speech, limo scene) but overall the film is pretty entertaining as a whole.",7,2,2,11 September 2010
Ice Age: The Meltdown," very funny movie
","The movie was really good and creative. It's as good as the first ice age. Funny, too! I couldn't help laughing. The movie was hilarious, but that's good anyway! The story was good, it had a fairy tale type ending, very unique and cool... The song in the middle bored me a bit. It was good afterwards though... The sound effects were okay. I liked the story which was nice. The visual and special effects were good. Kids and youngsters are gonna like the movie. It's worth watching once. The movie keeps you glued to the screen and makes you like it. There's a lot of adventure in the middle. The character of Diego, Sid, Manny, etc. were funny and great. The movie isn't boring at all, its worth watching. If you want a movie with a lot of funny dialogs and great a plot then, this movie is a must for you!!! You wont be disappointed while watching.10/10",10,0,0,8 October 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Entertaining but should have been better
","Prince of Persia the sands of time, is a great video game ever, and I was really curious at first to see how this movie would turn out. I am not an avid gamer of this game but I have played the game sometimes. I wanted to see if ''Disney'' could make the movie as epic as the video game. When i first saw the first look i was really intrigued by it. Then the official casting has been made and I notice that i saw Jake Gyllenhall as the Price Dastan, then I sorta knew that it was going to be a complete disaster. Not only they changed the whole theme of the video game but also i was really shocked that the only character that came even close to the game was Ben Kingsley's role, he was without a doubt the perfect one for the role of Nizam.For the movie, it had nice special effects and the landscape was nice but the story wasn't that great. It could have been much better, and it was a little confusing to follow. Also the relationship between Dastan and the Princess Tamina was quite awkward. At first they didn't like each other then after a few scenes together they were scene teasing each other, and fooling around town (no pun intended).It should be noted that Disney produced this. Disney basically means no violence, no gore nothing. The video game was rated M for Mature, while this movie is rated PG-13. I guess they wanted to make the movie visible to more people so they could get more money from the profits. Not the best move but I can see why they did this. I really like the armoury, i love the way they designed the weapon and the dagger of time itself was a pretty good job. I really loved the way they presented us Tamina (Gemma A) she was one of the good points of this movie along Sir Ben Kingsley's fine acting. The movie was actually really boring at certain parts. The only real parts were the fight scenes and when he's using the dagger of time. Also the ending was alright, could have been better. Though I know they're be a sequel and am expecting that to be better. Overall this movie is not close near the game and it was quite disappointing. ==================================================================== ======= After a rewatch (02/24/17) after nearly seven years later, my opinions have changed slightly on this film. I do not quite remember the video games as I once have but this film isn't too bad. The actions sequences are there and although it is Disney and the games were rated R, it wasn't as bad as once remembered, it could have been a lot worse. It is quite predictable in the ending but noticeably entertaining and a decent journey. Knowing that this film did not produce a sequel, may have been for the best. Changed from a 5/10 to 7/10.",7,8,12,19 August 2010
Balls of Fury," It offers some laughs but not enough
","Balls of Fury seemed like a clever idea; take all the clichés from martial arts b-movies and apply them to ping-pong. Unfortunately, this flick doesn't deliver on its promising premise. First from seeing the trailer, I didn't know what to expect but it looked alright. This film wasn't be taken serious but just silly and comedic. There are some jokes there but some also childish acts. Most of the jokes are toilet jokes, jokes involving the blind man. It was surprising to see Christopher Waken in this. Though he was pretty god as the villain. He's a natural; his timing is terrific and he makes nearly everything he says worth a giggle or two in 'Balls.' Without him, there wouldn't be much to write about this movie at all. It could have been much better but it was pretty okay imo",5,1,1,30 August 2010
Ted," Funny and enjoyed it
","From Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane comes a very solid comedy about the over-dependent relationship between John (Mark Wahlberg) and his walking, talking, swear-happy, bong-smoking teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane). His girlfriend (Mila Kunis) is unhappy with Ted's disruptive influence and john has to make the uncomfortable decision about having to grow up. While merrily delivering all the coarse anti-PC humour the Family Guy fanbase have a right to expect, the best thing about Ted is also its biggest surprise - it has real heart. In lesser hands this could so easily have been a throwaway one-joke movie, yet Ted actually develops into a full-bodied tale about friendship as MacFarlane actually makes you care about the relationship between John and his boyhood bear.The film's top-shelf visual effects go a long way to making the premise work, but what ultimately sells it is the quality of the direction. Despite the fact that he's a stuffed toy he's actually more credible than the cardboard characters that populate most rom-coms. Beneath all the naughty jokes and signature pop culture references - just watch the sales of Flash Gordon DVDs skyrocket! - you really care for this bear. As a rewatch 06 14 19' then again 06/08/20' Ted remains a highly entertaining comedy.",8,2,5,30 November 2012
Oldboy," Very impressive and thoughtfully entertainment
","Having heard of this film and being somewhat familiar with its plot (and knowing of it's twist before hand), also having watched the 2013 American remake several years back. Decided in finally acquiring and watch the original. As well known that this film is highly appreciated and has been praised since its released and is considered one of the greater Asian films along with films in general (of its time). To start off, at first the film is quite confusing but also the pacing and motive of the film is never dull.There is constantly something which makes it engaging and a major part is due to the filming, direction and overall visuals and scenery. It really does look wonderful even after all these years. Some really great shots and scenes which stand out and capture this film as great to look at. One of course, is the hallway fight scene with Dae-su fending off many guards.Although having watched this movie with subtitles, there were still some slight confusing during several scenes but after reading few reviews and reading its trivia or key points, it helped give a better understanding. As a whole Oldboy is very well done with its action sequences, it's drama and its overall mystery.Oldboy is clearly quite a twisted tale and isn't for everyone. It has a very fresh feel about it within its tone, and the acting is well up to par. There are some questionable scenes which have been mentioned before (Dae-su eating the live octopus?) but overall those scenes make the film stand out.The twist and overall explanation of the twist in the end (around last 30 minutes) how everything unfolds is well told. There are more than one twist but of course we are familiar with the major one. Having known of this major twist (father-daughter) prior to watching, was very keen and expecting it but did not know how it would unfold. Although it somewhat ruined the overall viewing experience. In the end, this is a film which may stay with you and have thoughts about it after watching- which makes for a memorable film. Highly recommend.",9,0,0,3 May 2020
Spider-Man 2," Excellent sequel to the original
","I've recently read many reviews from posters and critics. And it seemed that there are far too many negative comments on this board about Spider-man 2. Much of the criticism is because of the fact that there is more romance and seemed more like a love story. This can be true but I disagree, the romance and action/adventure with suspense is great in this film. I enjoyed the first one but I gotta say that this was one better. The story was more developed along with the characters and it felt better. The CGI was better and so were the action scenes. Also the characters felt more ral as they showed more emotino and depth. There was far more suspense. Especially the scenes where Harry find out that Peter Parker is Spiderman, same with Mary-Jane. Also the scene in the train was great, and the ending was nice. The villain in this one (Doc.Oc) was more developed and it had a better story. In Spider-Man (2002) the villain- Green Goblin looked like some sort of a power ranger bad villain and his face didn't move when he moved, and the costume looked rather cheap, where as in this one the villain looks very sophisticated & realistic. Spider-man 2 was going at a pretty good pace all the way to the end. The acting is improved and really great especially by Tobey Maguire. Overall a brilliant comic book movie & equally as good as X-men 2. A perfect 10/10 for this amazing movie.

As a rewatch 04/04/19' Spider-Man remains a high quality superhero film and arguably the best Spider Man film to date. There is more tension and more at stakes and risks we see here compared to the first.

Point Break," Quite bland and generic
","The original Point Break (1991) had something special and unique about it, from the performances to the overall action, mystery and suspense. However, this remake, a lot of what made the original great is missing and non existent. The lack of suspense and thrills is gone, as well as the overall charm. It isn't nearly as enjoyable and witty like the original and makes us wonder as to why this film was remade. We all knew they would not top the original, especially given the cast but this remake could have been a lot better. Overall, Point Break (2015) is bland, generic and quite a waste of time. Disappointed, this film is as bad as critics and fans are saying.",2,2,2,17 February 2018
The Fifth Element," Entertaining Sci-Fi
","The Fifth Element is one of Luc Besson's earlier science fiction films, which is considered one of his better films in his filmography. While watching the film, we will notice Milla Jovovich in a very early role as a career starter. Within we realize that she is what the title of the film represents. Meaning, she is the fifth element, she's the sum total of our hope for survival, but she's way down the cast list and she can't get around town without Bruce Willis. The Fifth Element is an entertaining and visually stunning sci-fi piece but at times the film somewhat drags on. Not as high on the film as it has been praised, it is mindless fun. What makes the film great is the presence of Milla Jovovich as Leeloo, as well as the portrayal of Bruce Willis' character. There is chemistry there and it shows as the film progresses.",7,1,2,7 May 2017
"I Love You, Man"," it was alright
","So I decided to watch this movie because I was bored. The movie was alright, at first I didn't really like it and thought the jokes were lame and unfunny but towards the end, the movie gets really good. The movie had its funny points, quite a few of them. Overall though the movie just presents several awkward points. If you are anything like me then it could pose a problem. It just seemed awkward how easily Peter met and became such close friends. It seemed too unrealistic. While watching the movie I was thinking that there was gonna be a twist about Sydney like he is gay or a bad person, but he ended up being a great person. I did really enjoy the movie at the end because I like the cast that they had. They just tried to use the awkward moments for comedy, which did work but its just so weird. I found funny that Sydney's dog was named after a former Egyptian President because he claimed to look a like, that was hilarious. I also liked when he was walking his dog on the boardwalk then it would leave crap and people stepped in it and reacted. That was funny I found it creepy that Peter was just finding guys so they can be his best man at a wedding. It just seemed odd how he was using Sydney at first. It also seemed unrealistic how Sydney acted. I mean, he didn't really ever get mad at Peter. Overall, it was pretty decent!",7,0,0,24 August 2009
Superbad," Brilliant Comedy
","WOW, this movie was so funny and well acted. It was so well written and honestly quite entertaining. I read many great comments about this movie and didn't get the time to watch it when it first came out, so one day I was just bored and decided to watch it on my CPU..it was great! I think that 3/4 of the people here who write negative comments on this movie either (A) have no sense of humor and then i completely understand, or (B) just don't like the actors in this movie. There are so many funny moments/scenes in this movie, and the characters are developed well and the jokes are target-on. It was funny because all of the F-bombs Seth (Johna Hill) was spilling out, same with Evans and Fogell aka McLoving. McLoving sold this sh*t hard, he was hilarious and big-ups to the officer (Seth Rogen)This movie overall honestly explained a very typical time in high school whether it be your senior year or sophomore year. It is all about proving yourself to other in an attempt to either get laid or just fit in. Hands down one of the funniest movies of that year. As a rewatch 07/20/18' and multiple years later, Superbad remains a great and hilarious time watching comedy. Filled with many subtle jokes and clever gags that did not noticed on initial watch, the film has seemed to age well.",10,2,5,14 August 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," it was pretty good
","Before watching this movie, i didn't have much high expectations like other people. I expected it to be alright, I didn't think it was going to be better than the first 2 xmen movies, and i was right. This movie is pretty decent, not as bad as people say, but not as good. All of X-men movies are pretty enjoyable and entertaining. The recent movie, X-men 3 is loud and entertaining at best. Now comes X-men origins: Wolverine is a prequel. It does its job to entertain people with its brutal and intense fight/action scenes and people will be engaged in the warped and mixed feelings of the mutants especially Wolverine. He has a tragic past that makes people feel sorry for him. We get the ruthless Victor Creed, who is known as Sabretooth, not being as cold-hearted as I thought. The story: Everything has its own past. Logan known as Wolverine is happy living his life working as a lumberjack and seeing his girlfriend everyday. Until then, William Stryker comes and destroy their lives. Wolverine becomes revengeful. I can't spoil the twists and turns or major story plot to those who are not familiarized with the story. The pace moves briskly. It is action-packed with some explosive action and also packed with mutants like well-know Gambit and Deadpool. Although the characters were kind of underused. They didn't show much of Gambit until near the end of the movie. But i guess that's why its called Xmen origins: Wolverine, because its about Wolverine's past and life. Some parts were confusing though.Overall: IMO Xmen origins: Wolverine is somewhere in the middle where you can enjoy watching it. Those who are not familiarized with the Wolverine's origins and want to know should catch this. Those who cannot get enough of X-men movies should be able to enjoy this or not. It is not the best or the worst marvel comic movie. As a rewatch (09/24/17') opinions remain same as this film does what is it supposed to. Decent and solid action superhero movie with an interesting story.",7,3,7,9 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Overhyped
","Hot Fuzz has been highly praised throughout from critics and fans alike since its release. Overall Hot Fuzz isn't as funny as it has been praised, though it is quite interesting at a certain point. The film has a slow build but within its second act it does get better. Not as great in terms of originality and some of the jokes feel forced. Many of the characters accents are at times hard to hear, and is a reason why the film isn't as great. Had this been done with typical american actors and not portrayed in London, it most certainly would have been better.",5,1,4,16 February 2018
Constantine," Under look the high praise
","With a current IMDB rating of 7 and over 1000 user reviews, Constantine seems to be well liked among general audiences. Having no knowledge of the source material and only watching this film many years after its release. Do not white understand as to what people are in this film to rate it as highly.
Although the beginning is quite interesting and leads to believe the film will hold up, it doesn't and becomes quite dull, confusing, and not as enjoyable. This is a supernatural type film with many reference of and talk about religion, God, demons, Hell and Heaven and other such topics. As a film it also drags on and the last part isn't as good. There is just a lacking suspense and mystery that makes it worthwhile.",3,2,4,3 October 2019

","Just Go With It is about a good-hearted plastic surgeon (Adam Sandler) who likes pretending he is married to get women unexpectedly finds that in order to land the 23-year old blonde of his dreams (Brooklyn Decker, a former model) he needs to fabricate an entire family an an impending divorce. This he does with the help of his assistant (Jennifer Aniston) and her kids. Though the rom-com formula dictates that the elaborate ruse must have Sandler and Aniston falling in love, the fully formed story creates a surprising amount of tension by not making the 23-year old blonde a disposable airhead. Full of crowd-pleasing laughs despite a lighter-than-usual quota of Sandleresque gross outs, the film (directed by long-time collaborator Dennis Dugan) serves as a solid reminder - especially to Sandler's detractors.",7,1,1,19 January 2013
Terminator Salvation," Great visual effects but the story is lacking
","Terminator Salvation is all special effects and zero depth. Yes, the action looks great but if you want all effects and no depth done well, go see a Michael Bay film. I think fans will be ashamed of it and new fans will think it's mediocre. The script was just so horrendous, along with the acting and overall pacing of the film. What's worse is the characters have absolutely no depth, leading you to feel no emotion whatsoever for what happens to them. Christian Bale's character was really annoying and not cool at all. He did that deep voice but had no depth. Also in one scene he says 'Ill be back' which I thought just wasn't right. Especially the way he did it. It just should not have been in the film. I though Sam Worthington's character (Marcus Wright) was done pretty well. He could have done a better acting job but it was alright.It honestly felt like Transformers 2 (which is not a good thing). A lot of the scenes in the film and machines had a ton of similarities to Transformers characters; that and the fact that it felt like a bad Michael Bay film. It was just action scene after action scene. The story and plot were missing. Also the dialogue felt cheesy and clichéd.",5,3,5,17 September 2010
Insomnia," Great sleeper thriller
","Having seen previous Christopher Nolan films and being a fan of his other work, Insomnia is one of his earlier films in which have yet to watch. As a film, this holds up quite well as a psychological type cop drama and thriller. It starts with the lead roles of Al Pacino and he is very solid as a cop playing a heavy sleeping disorder. Originally not knowing that this film is a remake (which could be the reason for a relatively low IMDB rating, currently 7.2-- in comparison to Nolan's other films) and having not seen the original, but found this version to be quite overlooked in some regards.Though one downsize is that the killer of Robin William's character isn't that interesting at all (as how it made it seem to start) and was seemingly a regular person (not a complete psychopath or oddball). In comparison to the killer in Se7en, this is far more tame. And the reveal of how he lead to the murder wasn't exactly thrilling but simply, as he put an 'accident'. Insomnia isn't such a mystery as one lead to believe, simply because the audience knows the reveal and it was straight forward in that part but more so of a drama.Very much detail seemed to be put in, and there are some key details along the way which make this film engaging. It isn't too quick in pacing but with good acting, good directing, and an intriguing plot, the film is never boring. Although some of the film was quite predictable, the journey along the way is worth the watch. A film in which you will remember immediately following its viewing.",8,0,0,10 October 2019
Aquaman," Lengthy and somewhat generic
","A lot of hype surrounded this film and it exceeded expectations, as it made over one billion dollars at the box office. Ultimately this movie has good special effects and is love to look at but the story feels rehashed and isn't nearly as entertaining as lead to believe. At points reminded of the Scorpion King, and that was rather bland and boring.Jason Mamoa does a solid portrayal as he isn't the problem. Amber Heard is the highlight as she provides enough energy with her character. Overall Aquaman is predictable and underwhelming.",4,1,1,4 February 2020
500 Days of Summer," Its original but nothing special
","500 days of summer is an original type of film that attempts to be funny using a variety of animation, voice-over, split-screen, slow- mo, and semi-documentary techniques along with an unusual jumping back and forth from future and past inserts that only results in a series of short-attention span. The end scenes of this movie almost make up for the chaotic, choppy, jerky editing that really detracts from the potential for a more traditional romantic drama that could have been even more powerful because the edgy script in linear form was likely great to begin with. There were many unnecessary dialogues and scenes but it was alright.While watching the film, it seemed clear that Summer was really into Tom as a boyfriend. First Tom gets Summer to go out with him. She says she wants it casual, but he really falls for her. She breaks it off and he's miserable for months after. Tom turns to his much younger sister to give the advice he needs. Then at the end, when the they for a final time, she tells him that she's married. She was really not nice to him and acted mean. Overall the film is decent but tries too hard to be fresh and exciting. Though its an opinion you. ==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch 09/06/17' and many years later, opinions have somewhat changed as I watched this film from a different perspective and forgot many scenes. We can understand why it is as praised as it isn't the typical Hollywood romance film we see today. The two leads are great and elevate the film making it better but many scenes seemed to drag.

","Concussion appears to be a serious matter sports drama based upon concussions about the linkage to playing football and brain damage. This is quite the typical sports drama which is based on real events as real people. It is clear that the studios and actors thought this film was Oscar worthy, but it ended up being a failure at that part not receiving any nominations. This film isn't bad but for one it is an acquired taste that many people are not seriously into, and as a result we have seen this film flop at the box office (which isn't a complete surprise).Will Smith's acting is good, as with the rest of the cast but overall it seems somewhat forgettable in the end. There are several intriguing moments in the film but as a whole, nothing in which we have not seen in sports drama's. Recommend but do not set your expectations too high.",5,2,2,5 August 2018
The Day After Tomorrow," Great effects but flawed
","The Day after tomorrow is a disaster movie with global warming, climate change and involves all sorts of tornadoes and storms.The movie feels like typical Hollywood with a nice and predictable ending and everyone seemingly fine in the end. It is watered down and of course has a very family friendly and feel good tone about it, but this is expected since it was intended to be a big summer blockbuster.The movie isn't completely bad, there are some nice looking effects but it is lacking any sense of mystery or thrills. Several flaws as well. Some things which were questionable were, the fact that they were in hiding in this large public library with multiple floors but apparently there wasn't a cafeteria or any lunch room. But just one vending machine.Also a scene where the girl cuts her leg, people start to notice the cut is bad and could be serious. So we see Jake Gyllenhaal and his friends go out and seemingly find a place for medicine, and they were so conveniently able to find the exact right medicine and find it pretty quickly.And of course the ending with Dennis Quaid traveling distances to rescue Jake and everyone in the library.",5,0,6,26 May 2019
Don Jon," Not Bad but has Certain Struggles
","Though it's set in New Jersey rather than Brooklyn, Don Jon -- written and directed by Gordon-Levitt, tells a tale of an Italian-American student who harbors a spark of life that draws him toward the wider world. It's even more condescending to the small-minded characters around him, if that's possible. Don Jon is also fast and funny.Jon's deliverance comes in the form of a messed-up pothead named Esther who sees through his insulation and tells him what he needs to hear.The down-shift from cartoon romance to romantic drama would be jarring if Esther were played by a lesser actress than Julianne Moore, who makes the wisdom she's given to deliver sound like good hard sense from an older woman who's been through hell.She's touching, Johansson is wonderfully awful and Gordon-Levitt is electric, making it easy to forgive the movie its streaking. The film wanders towards Johansson's character exits, as we see more screen time with Julianna Moore. Don Jon seeks a specific audience, but the overall tone of the film could have been far better than its content shows. Disappointment from critical reviews deceive.",5,1,3,15 December 2014
Deadpool 2," More of the same?
","Being a fan of the first Deadpool film, was highly anticipating its sequel. Having relatively high expectations from the first film. This film did not completely disappoint but it felt somewhat very similar (which can be good but also bad?). Seeing different comments and reviews regarding the film (both positives and negatives).Many claim this film is better than the original, while others claim the original better. Perhaps I enjoyed the original better simply because I had no expectations and the violence and humor felt more organic and genuine.Deadpool 2 isn't bad but some of its jokes felt forced and just weren't as funny. We understood them but overall, with its set pieces. Things did not match up. The plot may have been better. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool does good as he is him, but some of the jokes could have been better in sense. Many misses or jokes that felt flat. Josh Brolin's Cable villain was decent but wasn't rally much of a villain (as it turns out in the end), and the kid Russell was annoying from the start.The character of Domino was a good touch as she stole her scenes, and in the end the use of Juggernaut was also well. Bringing back the female teenage warhead girl and Colossus weren't bothersome. Though overall, this film wasn't as great as expected.Some of the highlights of the movie were the scenes where Wade assembles his new team (X-force), as the process of finding them. The uniqueness of each character was well thought out and quite funny, also their short timely deaths added some humor in that regard. Did like the ending of the film (including the post end credit scenes), so that made it more worthwhile.Perhaps a second viewing months from now may change the overall viewpoint.",7,0,0,28 March 2019
X-Men," Successful start to a great franchise
","X-Men released back in 2000 had several among fans of hype since it was the beginning of the decade as well as the film has been very anticipated. This film does a lot well and is a great piece of entertaining. Running relatively short on screen time (about 96 mins excluding the end credits) compared to the typical 2+ hour of other comic book superhero films. Although the pacing could have been better, since it wasn't too long, things come into place very quickly and the film becomes instantly good. The cast is great, which is what makes the film excel. The chemistry between the characters work out well, especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) with Patrick Steward (Charles Xavier) as well as the other heroes Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Rogue. The visual effects are top notch. We see how far this franchise has come into the year 2017 as many had not known back then how successful these films would have become. Comparing this original X-Men film to the newer films of the 2010's, this feels somewhat more dark in spirit, and less comical in some ways. A feel in tone is noticeable. X-Men most definitely lived up to the hype and is overall exciting and faithful to its original comic book origins. Although with quite a simple plot, it flows decent enough and by the end of the film (in which an obvious sequel was set), we are left wanting more. Highly recommend for those of fans of the source material as well as those wanting to see how the origin started.",7,1,1,2 December 2017
Spider-Man 3," Disappointing end of the trilogy as it shows
","Having watched Spider-Man 3 for the first time since years after its release, one forgot a lot about this film. Many consider this film to be the worst of the Raimi Spider-Man franchise and the failure of Spider-Man 3 to be why they rebooted the series 5 years later.The film did have its typical action and the special effects were great but after a heavy rewatch, it is clear this film did have many flaws. As many critics and fans have mentioned, the main problem is that the film tries cramming in a little too much into the film, which makes the main focal point hard and difficult. Also there are a few cheesy moments which were used for comic relief but it didn't work in my opinion. Specially when Peter Parker gets infected with the black Spider-Man suit and becomes 'evil/bad', we see a moment of him dancing to jazz music walking down the street, then the scene involving him showcasing his talents in the Jazz club in front of M.J and Gwen Stacy. The entire time involving his slight personality change of being 'evil' within the black suit that also altered his hair slightly was just cringe acting from Tobey MaGuire. Did not like it as it felt forced for comic purposes. First you have the main storyline of Peter/M.J relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story from the start and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Then little subplots with Gwen Stacy and the competition of Peter and Brock working at the Daily Bugle. It's a little too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie. Two villains (Sandman and Venom) may not seem much as people have mentioned but it slightly was. Some may add that Green Goblin was another villain but that was merely for a few scenes in the beginning and Harry was never truly a villain. We see him more as a friend to Peter, even though he did want to kill Peter for killing his father. The way the villains became villains (Sandman and Venom) are all too coincidental. Sandman escaping Prison than falling into a large hole/ditch of sand, while Brock just so happens to be in the same place (a church) where Peter is having problems with the black suit then it falling onto Brock.What we did enjoy is the effects of the black suit Spider-Man and the look of venom. The look of Peter in the black suit was really well as were his scenes, it was just when he changed as Peter becoming evil wearing the black suit underneath that was the problem. The graphics made this film much more satisfying but overall with the flaws, one can see why this film is considered the worst of the franchise and the reason for the reboot. Briefly comparing Tobey MaGuire's Spider-Man to Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man, you can see the clear differences in personalities and attitudes. In this film, especially the first half, Peter is much more upright, happy, is always smiling, and his overall character is more of a pushover and nerd than the Peter Parker/Spider-Man of Garfield's. Another negative about Spider-Man 3 is the amount of sad and depressing crying or lonesome scenes we see. At times, it felt like a sappy romance film as it didn't work. Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Mary Jane came off much more unlikable here than the previous two films as she was more whiny and seemed less appreciative throughout. The obvious jealously with Gwen Stacy was clear as it showed, Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job and was a highlight. Also the ending battle was okay but it gets the questions as to why exactly did Sandman want to kill Spider-Man in the first place. The entire character was off switching as they try making the character appear to be a good person in the end. His entire motive leading up was to kill Spider-Man but it was never really mentioned why. This reminded very much of the Amazing Spider- Man 2 villain of Electro, another weak villain but didn't have much motive in wanting to kill Spider-Man, only because he was the 'bad guy'. Both weak and not interesting villains.Although Spider-Man 3 has these flaws, it is still quite entertaining from an aspect as we do enjoy the character and some things in the film. Being difficult in rating this film but from a standpoint from the other two films, it is the worst in the series and a rewatch really confirms it. Though, Spider-Man 3 is still a better film and overall more satisfying than the Amazing Spider-Man 2.",5,0,2,17 July 2017
Yes Man," Yes Man was pretty good...
","Before watching this movie, I thought that it was going to be real funny and very entertaining. It wasn't that funny though, not like Jim Carry's usually gags and jokes. This was alright. Yes man tells the story of man Carl Allen (Jim Carrey)who challenges himself to say Yes to almost anything and everything. There are a lot of jokes in the film, and some of them are put to well use. But then again, some were just plain unfunny and awkward. But Carrey blazes above all else with his humor. He's still the zany goofy guy we all like and admire. Some parts of this film was great. others were weird. I mean, in the beginning his friend tells Carl to go to a Yes Man convention where a speaker tells the audience to say yes to everything and to be committed to saying yes. It starts out pretty weird. The guy tells Carl to say Yes to everything and that he has to. Carl agrees with this and follows his plans. The story basically starts from there. The thing I don't understand is, when Carl was forced to say yes and when he wanted to say 'no', why couldn't he just say words that mean 'no' like 'nope, naw, i cant', and stuff like that...That as wack The story is somewhat predictable. Sure, it has a preachy message hidden somewhere in there, but all in all it's a pretty good message: Say yes to (almost) everything and you'll have a better life. I couldn't agree more after seeing this film.Overall, it's a very good comedy that will definitely make you smile, feel better, and inspired when you walk out of the cinema. Definitely a worth watching, its was great...coulda been better though",7,0,2,14 March 2009
The Prestige," Great Magician Duo
","The Prestige opens in London around the turn of the 19th century, with the death of magician Rupert Angier (Jackman), with Alfred Borden (Bale), another magician, as the only suspect. While Borden is held in prison during the trial, he is brought a copy of Angier's journal, which he reads and we see in flashbacks. One of these flashbacks reveals that years earlier, Angier got hold of a copy of one of Borden's journals and while Angier reads it we get a further flashback and so we have a flashback within a flashback, which allows us to see the story from both of the lead character's point of view.Both Angier and Borden began their career's as apprentices to the same magician. Angier's wife was the magician's assistant. One night, Angier's wife died during a water tank trick because she was unable to untie the knots in time; knots tied by Borden. This incident is the beginning of the rivalry and hatred between the two men that will carry throughout the movie.They both soon launch themselves into solo careers. Borden is the superior magician, but Angier, with the help of his mentor, Cutter (Caine), is a far better showman. Cutter hires Angier a pretty assistant (Johansson) and helps him learn a few new tricks. Borden on the other hand, while not as successful, performs tricks that Angier longs to master. After stealing Borden's greatest trick, The Transported Man, Angier becomes very successful, but still his greatest obsession is getting revenge on Borden by humiliation or any other means he can. His obsession lasts years and takes him around the world and costs him dearly, both emotionally and financially. Borden doesn't sit idly by either, matching Angier with acts of retaliation that prolong the rivalry. And the revenge on both sides isn't merely connected to their careers as both of them extract their pound of flesh from the other.Jackman and Bale make great rivals and while at times Jackman's Angier seems like the protagonist, they each rotate in and out of that role as the story reveals its secrets. In the end you might be wondering if the film contains a protagonist at all or if both characters haven't each received what was coming to them. Caine's and Johansson's roles are both supporting as their character's lives are dictated by Borden and Angier.",9,0,1,14 August 2014
The Terminator," The start of a generational franchise
","Having it being over 35 years since the release of the Terminator back in October 1984, this is the film which has seemingly spawned sequels last over three more decades. Now finally watching this movie in full and paying closer attention to detail, one can see as to why it is as highly praised as it is.What stands out is not only Arnold's performance as the Terminator but the pacing of the film is top notch and it keeps the audience guessing each way. The suspense and mystery is intriguing and we are watching to see what happens next.Filled with many great action scenes and a plot that makes us think- and sets our mind thinking about possible realistic outcomes. One of a kind film that delivers on all around action, slick fears and compatible characters.",9,0,1,28 October 2019
Cloverfield," A very rare and unique monster film
","After reading many reviews from this film I decided to check it out. I wasn't all that interesting in the film when it came out back in 2008, so I finally decided to watch it, and I thought it was pretty good. Cloverfield is a unique monster film because of the filming method (its all by a hand-held camera). Its engaging and very entertaining. At first it gets somewhat distracting and annoying then you eventually get used to it. And I thought it actually worked- it made the audience feel as if they were actually there with the group of people seeing the monster attack. Cloverfield has some good thrills, many of them are from jump scenes with the monsters (not too scary and unexpected). The film was pretty interesting but it could have been better had they focused more on the monster. The movie is pretty short. The first 20 mins takes place at a party then the film takes off when the friends notice a monster from outside. Most of the main cast end up dying and since its being filmed by a hand-held camera, you don't see how brutal the death's are- it happens pretty quick.The characters were alright, not really that likable but not that bad. I think they should have done more development on them to have made the film better. Cloverfield is definitely better than that garbage Skyline- which gets compared to because of its recent monster/alien type films. Watching Cloverfield, you could tell that Skyline borrowed many scenes from the film. I think Cloverfield could have been better had they made the film about 20 minutes longer. The actual film ended around the 73rd minute (73.45). This film is definitely not for everyone. Many complaints are from the camera but to watch a film like this you need to have an open mind, and take it for what it is.",8,1,2,18 December 2010
The Hateful Eight," Interesting though overly long
","The Hateful Eight is set in Wyoming in the years after the Civil War, as bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) takes his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) into a remote haberdashery to wait out an impending blizzard. Along the way, he picks up Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), a former Union Army officer who has also gone into the bounty hunting trade. The company they find at the store turns out to be a bunch of killers, all hiding their own agendas.This film is quite interesting within its engaging dialogue and scenery but does drag on at certain points. With a running time of 2 hours 48 minutes, it does get quite overlong and boring at certain points and was slightly difficult in watching and staying away for the entire film. There are good characters which does make the film work, as Samuel L. Jackson is in typical form as he helps carries the film, along with Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walter Goggins who steals his scenes.Overall, the Hateful Eight isn't an easy film to digest as it is violent, offers a lot of imagery and contains a little amount of action, with much talking. Such as all Quentin Tarantino films, this isn't for everyone.",6,1,2,17 June 2018
Dear John," Thoughtful with likeable characters
","Having not read the novel, and having no expectations, Dear John is about what expected it to be. It's passable due to the characters and their motives. Several critics claim Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried didn't have great chemistry but thought it was believable.The film may be slower than other romantic dramas but there is a pay off in the end, and unlike many of these types of films, Dear John isn't completely predictable. Then the twist in the film happens regarding a tragic event (9/11) which took off guard but was plausible.Though what did not completely like was near the ending in regards to Savannah ending the relationship with John because her close friend and neighbor Tim was sick and his son needed care. This has obviously been brought up by reviews but made little sense as to why she needed to marry him in order to take care of him. There didn't seem to hint at any romance with one another throughout the film.Then of course in the very end more years have now passed and she's writing a letter to John mentioning that Tim has passed away from cancer. And eventually (at least what is implied) is that John and Savannah end up with each other at last- when he meets or sees her in a coffee shop. So in the end, a sad yet happy ending.",7,0,1,10 July 2019
Ocean's Twelve," Over the top and off paced
","Ocean's Twelve is the sequel to the hit film Ocean's Eleven released in 2001. Starting into the film, it takes place where the crew flies to Europe in an attempt to pull off quick heists in order to pay off Benedict. There, they find out they are up against a mysterious character who is thwarting their plans for some unknown reason. They have to find this person and stop him before Benedict's deadline. They are also being pursued by a clever detective, Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is close to arresting them. I was willing to put up with this unbelievable nonsense for a time, but my breaking point came when the film actually has Julia Roberts portraying Tess Ocean, who, in turn is portraying Julia Roberts as part of a plot to get close to a guarded treasure in a museum. I don't think this could ever work, but in order for it to have a chance, wouldn't Julia Roberts have to at least establish the character of Tess Ocean first? It ruined the film as a whole and became quite over the top and silly at this point.One of the things you need in order to have a successful heist movie is a good heist, or a good confidence scheme. Here, the big heist at the end of the movie turns out to be an afterthought. It is a throwaway heist shown as a flashback. The acting is casual, at best. The big problem is screen time. There is only enough of it for Clooney, Pitt and Matt Damon. Most of the others in the all-star cast, like Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Andy Garcia and Roberts, have very limited roles.",4,1,2,4 July 2016
Snatch," Lot of characters not much interest
","Snatch has been critically acclaimed throughout and has been praised as such a great film with an interesting take on a British crime, involving many characters. However as watching the film, there were many characters but too many where we did not care for them. The plot at times is confusing with these characters all coming together but in the end we do not really care. For a film with a running time of a little over 1 hour 40 minutes, it feels longer than one should. As an ensemble cast, not many stand out except Jason Statham (in a very early role in his career) and Brad Pitt (though not in a good way, speaking with a difficult hard to hearing accent- and wondering why he took this role). Too many characters, and were not interesting, was hard to remember their names as well. What makes it worse is the constant jumping from characters and scenes. Snatch is quite the overrated film and wondering why it is currently in the IMDb top 250 with a rating of 8.3. Also praise with comedy and having humor but nothing into the film is quite at that, where the scenes feel bland and wondering as to what people found funny. Apart from some of the boxing scenes involving Brad Pitt, the scenes with Jason Statham and the last 20 minutes or so, Snatch is not a good recommend.",2,7,15,6 July 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Great addition to the Spider-Man franchise
","Being a fan of the Spider-Man franchise in general, one was very eager in watching the film. After hearing and seeing many positive reviews, expectations were somewhat high. And after watching the film, the expectations were as expected met and the film is as good and entertaining as read.What makes Homecoming a great film is that it is entertaining and the film does not take itself too serious. There is much less drama and overall it didn't have this depressing and sad tone about it (like how the Amazing Spider-Man films were). So in that sense, the general tone was a much happier and more fun.Tom Holland was also a great look for the role of Peter Parker, as he does look the age (much more younger in comparison to the previous Spider-Men in Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield), and he also has the charisma and an energetic feel about him which make as it seem as he is interested in the character.Where as Tobey was decent but at the same time, had this sad and wondrous look on his face, and Andrew was more moody, emo and slightly unlikable (at least more so i the 2nd of his films).Another thing which made the film great was the overall addition with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. The plot was different here than in previous Spider-Man films which was fresh and entertaining.Also, Spider-Man's suit was also by far the best of the previous entries, as in this film since technology is more up to date, we actually see an upgrade with the suit (Yet this seemed to annoy people as there have been some backlash)Negative comments about the film are the fact that the film feels more child friendly and teenager ascendant, which is the point of the film. As there are many scenes revolving around his highschool (hence the title of 'Homecoming')Overall, this film was as expected as did enjoy it. Hopefully its sequel coming this summer meets expectations and continues this great franchise.",8,2,3,29 March 2019
The Beach," Doesn't reach the heights it could
","Having not read or being familiar with the novel of which this film is based upon, I had a clear view and non-bias judgment based upon the film in a viewing. The Beach is somewhat looked upon as a forgettable or lesser known film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and a lesser Danny Boyle film. This is for obvious reasons. The film did poorly in the domestic box office but was able to make up its budget due to the foreign market (perhaps due to DiCaprio's starpower, since the Beach was his first film after Titanic). The film has an interesting premise and somewhat decent plot, but it doesn't reach the proper levels that it could have. Not knowing how much is adapted based on the novel, it is more difficult in judging. However, the film is quite bland when watching despite its scenery. It felt more so like an early MTV based film than and actual mature Danny Boyle film. Leo plays an interesting character but besides him, we don't seem to care about the rest, and that hurts the film. The final 30 minutes or so fall downhill as it becomes tiresome and tedious in a bad way.",5,1,1,6 April 2017
The Expendables," Somewhat entertaining but bad storyline
","The Expendables has somewhat a lot of action but it is lacking in storyline and a good plot. The movie retained the finest action figures one could only dream of putting together in one frame and that was exactly what Sylvester Stallone did. Watching Sylvester guiding a bunch of mercenaries was a joy in itself and that too action heroes like Jet Li, Jason Statham, Randy Couture and Terry Crews. Steve Austin maintains his dignity by beating up Sylvester Stallone but eventually ends up as a victim to Randy Couture. The acting was pretty bad and the script/ dialogue was also pretty disappointing. Their were some action and fight scenes towards the end but it was difficult to watch because of the shaky camera and it would switch directions very quickly.Jason Statham manifested some great skills in there with his awesome fighting style. He was the best character in this. Jet Li augmented himself to the list of fighters by beating the hell out of the bad guys. Dolph Lundgren was asked to leave the group because of which he fires back at Sylvester and Jet Li but ends up getting shot ( not killed as he rejoins the team eventually ). Eric Roberts poses himself as the bad guy with Steve Austin watching his back every now and then. Terry Crews has one great scene where he comes out with his shotgun and goes on a rampage. It was a wasted opportunity for Willis and Swarzenneger. They were only seen in one scene and it was pretty fast. Also for a movie with this many action stars, it was only a little over 90 minutes. They should have focused more on a story and tale the film over 2 hours.The Expendables tries to do too little with too much. It ticks a lot of the mandatory action genre boxes with its big bangs, slimy villains, one-liners and curiously named heroes, but provides a largely hollow and unengaging experience. Expendables? Disposables more like.",4,2,6,9 September 2010
Scary Movie 2," Not much different than the original
","Very quickly and seemingly only one year after the large success of Scary Movie, it was no surprised a sequel was coming. It made have been a mistake since this film made much less at the box office than Scary Movie.Found Scary Movie 2 to be a slight upgrade from the original in terms of comedy and overall setting. Though there are somethings about the original which made it better. Mainly spoofing the Haunting, the plot comes very quick and doesn't seem to take long to settle. The caretaker in the house is quite creepy, though with some funny gags. A talking crass mouthed parrot is one of the highlights.After reading other reviews, most seem to believe Scary Movie 2 as rushed and a downgrade from the original, though one's opinion is slightly different. The same original cast is brought back with added some newer ones.Scary Movie 2 does feel very short with a runtime of only 83 minutes (without end credits it's about 75 minutes), so everything that happens is crucial.",4,1,1,1 January 2019
Final Destination 2," Poorly Written, Lacking Originality
","The first movie took the time to follow teen horror flick conventions, to develop characters -as thin as they were - and to throw in some theories about why all these people were dying. In the second movie, all these time-fillers are skipped and the movie becomes a heaping helping of mind-boggling mayhem. Final Destination 2 asks why it should bother with the parsley of plot, dialogue, or characters, when people just want a plateful of death.In many ways, tunneling all of the sequel's energies into a smorgasbord of imaginative deaths works better than the heavy-handed 'suspense' of the original film. The acting is mediocre at best. Do they solve the riddle in time? Few will care, considering that there is no reason to like any of the characters and the main thrill of the movie comes from the elaborate nature of the deadly accidents. If this movie is supposed to be a scary thriller, then it flies far of the mark. If, however, Final Destination 2 seeks to take us no further than bloody spectacle, then it does a fine job indeed.
==
As a rewatch 12/10/18' Final Destination isn't completely as bad as remembered. Over five years since the original viewing, much remembered had been forgotten save for some scenes. Nothing too memorable about this film in comparison to the original. We can see as to why audiences preferred the original, with a main reason being the cast was more likable and easier to root for. Though this film,the death scenes and overall deaths are far more gruesome and violent.There is a different atmosphere here, as the film seems more serious, though filled with more noticeable silly dialogue. Overall Final Destination 2 isn't bad for what's it worth, as there are still several scenes of suspense, thrills and overall excitement. Rating changed from 3 to 5. As another rewatch 03/11/20' opinions remain same. There are some clever and good moments but as a whole, the original is superior.",5,1,4,12 June 2013
Knocked Up," Great on multiple viewings
","I had real high hopes for Knocked up and I was little disappointed in the result. The movie is pretty good but its not all that. I thought it could have been much more funnier and entertaining. It was very boring at certain points. It was more focused on real life and drama then a straight up comedy. The title of the film suggests the type of over-the-top brainless, sexist film which conforms to all the clichéd elements that came before it. But it's not. The film has a real subtle warmth about it. The leading performers all have a under-stated likability about them. I liked the improvised dialogue that Ben and his stoner friends used during their scenes, it gave each of their characters their own individuality, each being able to hold his/her own screen presence. I suppose there is a point to be made there but sometimes you should appreciate something for what it is. To finish, this is not a laugh out loud comedy, however, if you've got a couple of hours to kill and you feel like watching something that makes you smile and forget that you live in rainy England for a while this picture is for you. There were many funny scenes and also boring scenes==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/05/17' Knocked Up is quite a much better film on another viewing. This film has lived up and has aged well. The jokes are more well thought and clever, and the performance by Seth Rogen was arguably his star turning moment. Although the leading women were unlikable, the rest of the cast make up for it. great comedy that has all the effects of a proper Apatow production. Rating changed from 6 to 8.",8,1,2,13 August 2010
Megamind," Decent film but seems to try too hard
","Megamind is a decent/average film in my opinion. Its pretty straight forward and gets to its plot right away. The story is predictable, but also seemed a little force and awkward at time. The animation is good and so are the effects. For a super villain, I thought Megamind was rather weak and not very convincing. He wasn't very evil at all, just insane and very sensitive. His character should have been done better, they should have made his character a little more likable yet bad-ass at the same time. Though Will Ferrell's voice work was spot-on, good job on his part. The other character's I didn't really care for, specifically Hal/Titan. His purpose wasn't very good, and I found him annoying. Metro Man was okay but he should have been more interesting- he seemed boring to me.Though, the biggest disappointment character in the film was definitely Roxanne. I know she was designed to be a regular person, but that doesn't mean they had to design her to look so uninteresting and plain. I was amazed with how expressive Megamind's face was, yet Roxanne's character looked so bland. Tina Fey's voice work added nothing to the character. Roxanne was supposedly to be a very pretty and likable character since all the lead males were tying to get her attention, yet I felt like her character was the weakest link and not exciting.I didn't see why Megamind, and Titan were really fighting for her- it didn't seem worth it. The ending of the film (the final showdown) was pretty good, but they should have made it less predictable. Overall, Megamind is a decent film but I was expecting more. As a rewatch 07/22/19' Megamind is quite liked more on this second viewing than the initial viewing. Although the comedy isn't that funny, it is refreshing seeing a villain turn hero type of animated superhero film.",6,1,3,13 January 2011
Blades of Glory," It seriously wasn't funny
","The movie was so stupid and wasn't funny in the least bit. Jon Heder's 15 minutes of fame expired a long time ago and this movie proves it. Maybe if the frat pack was cast it may have been more entertaining, but the plot script and Heder ruined the film. I wonder why Owen Wilson wasn't cast as Jimmy, I think he would have had a better performance compared to Heder. The movie is short, not funny and this could be one of Will Ferrell's worst performances. Seriously, I had high hopes before watching this movie because a few of my pals told me they loved it. The expectations were never met, this movie is garbage. As a Will Ferrell fan I would hate to see his career end on a low note, and hopefully the next roles he chooses will be funny and the plot will be much more interesting. There were too many sex references in this movie and more curing than expected. The film was way too predictable and we have seen this same plot happen many times.If this movie was 'R rated', i think it would have been MUCH better and funny. Think about it, had they threw in F-bombs and more sexual content, it would have been better (look at Semi-Pro, now imagine it without the F-bombs and 'R rating'. This film was terrible save your time and see something else or rent a frat pack comedy if you're in a Will Ferrell mood!",2,1,2,6 September 2009
Horrible Bosses," Over the top and Forced Comedy
","Horrible Bosses has been praised by many of one of the funniest, if not the funniest movie of 2011. Having passed upon it many times having little interest in it, I decided to watch it. As a comedy I expected more laughs but most of the jokes fall flat to me. The humor is either crude without meaning (many of the constant insults) and not witty or clever enough, and predictable. It is a film where I understand what the jokes are and I can imagine people laughing at them but I didn't find them funny.What does work is the story is interesting, I was interested in if they were actually to go ahead and get revenge on their bosses and see how it unfolded. The chemistry from Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day was present as they carried the film. I didn't care too much for the bosses. Kevin Spacey's character came off bad, had no interest in Collin Farrell's, and was in between Jennifer Aniston (many other actresses could have sold the role better).Maybe laughed about twice throughout the entire film, one involving the introduction scene of Jamie Foxx and another to due with the back and forth conversation of Bateman and Day (when they sneak into Space's house). I did not find the gag with the voice detector in the car to be funny. It was almost too forced.Horrible Bosses being R rated was suited, as had it been PG-13 the appeal wouldn't be there. Only had they included more clever jokes and gags. Many of it was over the top, and the death to Farell's character was too soon (he was possibly underutilized). I think had it ended better, maybe adding a few extra scenes, this would have faired better. I am somewhat wondering how the sequel will be, as seeing many sequels to comedy hits haven't been as great as the original.
As a rewatch 04/19/19' Horrible Bosses does certain things right but is also quite over the top. The lead characters are likable but as a comedy, nothing was too funny. More so predictable humor.",5,0,1,3 January 2014
Nacho Libre," Could have been much better
","Jack Black really isn't at all funny in this movie. It's got a few scenes which are pretty funny, but most of the jokes are played out and just not even funny. Though the facial expressions are funny (more than the one-liners) I wasn't expecting much from the storyline but what I got was even less. Some of the wrestling sequences are alright and are well-filmed, but as a whole I just didn't think this movie delivered.Some scenes are overly done intentionally to get a laugh, but in many (if not all) of these scenes they just completely miss their mark. Nacho, for some reason, has a tendency to pass gas at any opportune time (and there are many in the film). I'm sure this is an example of something that is supposed to be funny, but it just doesn't work.Also, this has to be one of the most predictable movies I have seen. It was predictable that he would end up getting that girl, predictable that he would enter the tournament, and was predictable that he would end up winning the whole thing and receive money in the end. Its been done many times before...way too predictable for me. And why was the colour that bad? i looked as if the movie was shot way before the actually screening",3,1,3,6 May 2010
The Town," Really Great and Complex
","The Town refers to Charlestown, Massachusetts; a poor Irish neighborhood on the outskirts of Boston - its claim to fame, spawning more bank robbers than any place else in America. Doug MacRay (Affleck) and Jem (Jeremy Renner) are the new robbery kings in Boston; childhood friends who grew up in criminal families, they run an elite heist crew for the local crime boss and florist, Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite). Their string of flawless robberies runs into a hitch when Jem kidnaps a beautiful bank manager, Claire (Rebecca Hall). They release her. But soon come to realize she lives four blocks away from them and is talking to the FBI (John Hamm). Doug's decision to check her out leads to a foolish and dangerous romance. She awakens in him the desire for a life without crime and violence, but Doug's world is not one you can simply walk away from.What makes The Town so interesting is the authenticity of the characters. Affleck has stuck to what he knows in his previous films and takes that to a pinnacle here. The neighborhood, its people, they are so genuine. I didn't recognize Blake Lively as Jem's drug-addicted, single mother sister. The accents, the dialogue, swagger, it's as real as it gets. So when the character conflicts begin to emerge, the doomsday events that unfold have weight to the audience. This is a fine ensemble cast, but the specificity of the performances seems like marionette strings being pulled by Affleck. As the lead actor and director, you can see him shaping these performances into precise delivery on screen.The action scenes are slick and well paced, but not set up to add a bang to the script every ten pages. These are criminal acts for money, dangerous activities driven by a ruthless man. You'd have to be crazy to attempt any of this stuff. This point is hammered in. Doug has lived on the edge of the knife for so long, resigned himself to the fate of a criminal, that when Claire opens up the possibility for a different life; it is truly an epiphany. It's easy to have a death wish when there's nothing to live for.",9,2,5,4 January 2013
Underworld Awakening," Great Action
","Having just watched Underworld Awakening and not being an avid fan of the previous films in the series (not watching them), my stance on this film may not be as accurate as to those whom have seen the entire films in chronological order. However then I am reviewing this film based on this one solely. I thoroughly enjoyed, found the action top notch, well directed and fast paced. I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan. Kate Beckinsale is great as Selene as well as the other supporting actors. The Lycans and vampires were an interesting take in this, as well as the final scene involving Selene having to fight the giant Lycan. The 3D was believable and so were the gimmicks. For an action movie, it delivers.",7,12,16,23 October 2013
Suicide Squad," Doesn't live up to the hype
","Suicide Squad has been highly anticipated for several years leading up to its release. There's a lot and nothing going on at seemingly the same time. The first 20 minutes of the film felt like it was written by an amateur and forgets the one basic tenant of filmmaking, show, don't tell. Every character is introduced via Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) voice over telling the audience the who, what, when and why in vignette form, complete with it's own soundtrack moment. It was paint by the numbers and painful to sit through. Firstly put she was miscast and the lengthy introduction by her was awful.The film has decent visuals and is wonderful to look at but the story and overall plot were lacking. It was basic and generic and we have seen similar storylines before. Jared Leto as the Joker is more of a background supporting character, instead of a straight lead, as advertised in the trailers and his high billing. Suicide Squad isn't completely terrible, just disappointing considering its success and its hype leading up to it. Perhaps the film is better on multiple viewings?",4,1,1,7 March 2018
Elf," Really nice movie
","When i first thought about seeing this film, I was expected it to be some cheesy Christmas movie where Will Ferrell acts like an idiot but i was pretty wrong. Will Ferrell's character is a 30 year elf and he acts as if he hasn't seen humans..Although some of his acting is a little over the top he plays his character well. But other than that, the movie is a really nice Christmas movie. Its a classic Christmas story.In the beginning it starts out a little boring but then it picks up the pace and the movie gets more interesting. It starts better when Buddy (Will Ferrell) goes and moves out of his elf home and decides to find he's real dad in New York...This movie isn't really funny but it has some funny scenes. For example when Buddy goes to the mall and see's Santa Clause for the first time but he notices that its an impostor, then they start fighting...Another funny scene is when Buddy hangs out with his brother Michael after school then they see bullies throwing snow balls at them, so Buddy starts making a ton of snow balls then they start firing back at them and the bullies leave and run away. That was classic The movie is a really nice film but it has its mistakes, anyway great work",7,1,2,5 October 2008
Shutter Island," Expected more thrills and twists
","Shutter Island has been very critically acclaimed but several fans and critics alike. The film by director Scorsese has become a hit as it was released back in February 2010. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the lead for their 4th collaboration (up to that point), Shutter Island does tell a very interesting story, however the journey we see does not fully equal to what one would expect. As all of Scorsese films, the performances delivered by the leads and supporting actors are top notch, as well as the visuals and scenery. Though one would have expected more. By the finale, when the big twist is revealed, it does not feel as one is satisfied with everything that has happened, or we simply do not care so much. It was somewhat predictable with everything leading up to the conclusion. Perhaps as many have stated, Shutter Island could use multiple viewings and perhaps one would enjoy it more with another viewing. Though as it stands, I do not understand its hype it has received, as I do not feel it is an IMDb top 250 worthy film.",4,2,5,15 October 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Delivers Great Action and Suspense
","Evans certainly possesses the physical heft, but struggles to add emotional bulk to the Cap's latest adventure in which the freeze- dried World War II relic is labeled a traitor after discovering a nefarious attempt by S.H.I.E.L.D. to infiltrate our privacy – and worse. The homeland spying is for the good of the people, agency head Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assures Cap, who isn't so sure about that or his boss's new fleet of drone-like killing machines. He thinks it's an attempt to rule by fear, not laws.Pausing for effect The Winter Soldier is not just a fantastic sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, it should also be recognized as one of the best sequels ever made. In fact, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the duo behind Thor: The Dark World, the Narnia Trilogy, and The First Avenger, have done such a great job shaping Captain America's story that this movie could almost stand on its own. There are many exciting twists and turns in this well- constructed, political action-thriller, but nothing comes as more of a shock than how important the story is at defining the direction of the MCU. What takes place in The Winter Soldier, along with an awesome mid- credits sequence tie-in, will inherently influence Avengers: Age of Ultron as well as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. – which should make the TV series a lot more interesting and reward fans who have stuck by its side. The direction will come into place for its third Captain America film. ==================================================================== ======= After a solid retwatch of this film (02/14/17'), I was able to see more things and more appreciate more of this film. As a sequel it definitely delivers upon the original and where it is a better film easily compared to Captain American: The First Avenger. What was more noticeable was the acting and overall film action scenes. This film delivers and has a certain charm where it doesn't feel stale or tend to drag on like its predecessor. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow steals the film, as she is great and makes people wonder why they have not made a solo Black Widow film for her as of yet. The romance isn't forced with Cap and Black Widow and it plays great in many scenes. Samuel L. Jackson's scenes are much better and delivered with proper accuracy as one can tell is a great fit for Nick Fury. The villain of Bucky (The Winter Solider) is a solid and interesting character and makes the others around him feeling intimidating. Originally had this film rated an 8/10, now will consed to change it to a 9/10. It has lived up to the test of time.",9,0,0,19 January 2015
Ocean's Thirteen," Clever heist throughout
","Ocean's Thirteen is is the third film in the Ocean's franchise, and appears to be better than it's predecessor. The film includes what audiences enjoy, where the crew rob from the rich and donate to charity.Similar as the other film's in this series, Clooney and Pitt merely walk through the movie without ever being forced to really act. They simply smile and pose. The film is done cleverly and the heist towards the end is well executed and thoughtfully entertaining. There is no nudity or vulgar language. Despite the location and these guy's profession, none of them are womanizers. And towards the end, there is even a scene in this movie where Pitt and Clooney get teary-eyed while watching Oprah (who also makes a cameo).",8,1,1,4 July 2016
Doctor Strange," Stunning Visuals, rehashed story
","Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a witty and somewhat arrogant genius neurosurgeon who has it all, until a car accident destroys his hands. No one and nothing in Western medicine can improve Strange's condition, so he sets off on a journey to the mystical East, where The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), opens the gates to worlds and powers that Strange did not know existed. These powers come handy when Strange has to face off with Mads Mikkelson's disgruntled Kaecillius in a mirror world, where anything and everything can be manipulated.Doctor Strange isn't a bad movie but as far as originality, the origin story is there but the overall concept appears to have been done. Everything occurs at a random pace and mainly wondering as to how he wanted to become this sorcerer simply from wanting to have his hands heal. The character reminded of Iron Man but here he is more unlikable and appears to think he is more superior to everyone else (though he does tone down his arrogance as the film passes). The comedy in the film is filled with little subtle jokes that could have been wiped out, no need for pop culture references for laughs and giggles. The movie felt in every way too simple and predictable and that Dr. Strange was never in any real danger. Not much suspense or thrills which the trailers showed, and the villain wasn't menacing or threatening enough. Although the ending was quite satisfying but obvious. Doctor Strange feels like a mash up of either Batman Begins or Prince of Persia, Inception and Harry Potter. We hope the sequel is more entertaining and overall satisfying.",5,0,0,6 July 2017
Interstellar," Refreshing and a bright discovery
","Interstellar starring Matthew McConaughey is a gripping sci-fi adventure that's simultaneously exciting and smart,a combination that is synonymous with director Christopher Nolan's back catalog. If the threads don't quite tie up, and the script occasionally suffers a few hiccups, these are minor flaws that can be easily forgiven, and which Nolan makes up for with craft, exuberance and ambition. The film is confident enough to take us on a thrilling adventure without resorting to huge action sequences, in which the spectacle is delivered on an intergalactic scale, but from a very human point of view. Nolan cuts away from earth in an effective sequence, propelling Cooper and us into the depths of space.",9,0,2,11 October 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Great performances and intriguing
","Having been described by several critics as a dark comedy due to its tone, Three Billboards is a solid convincing story about revenge and justice.The performances from the leads stage out and are given great lengths but as done points the films somewhat drags on. There is done good deal of realistic violence and sine scenes of suspense but expected more. Can see the praise for this film, and it's Oscar nominations but overly not as great as lead to believe.",7,1,3,23 August 2019
Pacific Rim," Visually stunning and entertaining
","Pacific Rim begins in 2020 Alaska, seven years into the war against the Kaiju, the giant sea monsters out to destroy the world if not for the man made hunting machines that face off against their foes in crude hand-to-claw combat. While looking impressive, with their flexible bodies, honed skills and built-in destructive weapons, the machines highlight the film's most laughable inanity.Since monsters vs. man made-machines is virtually all that Pacific Rim is about, the human element lags behind . Charlie Hunnam plays Raleigh Becket, trained to take control of one of the two-person hunters. Having previously lost his partner-brother during combat, he comes equipped with a built-in backstory to want redemption. Fans will be then anticipating it's sequel in several years and many can hope it is a well deserved wait.",8,0,1,8 October 2015
Gone Baby Gone," Provides Thrills
","What Gone Baby Gone is is an intermittently competent urban detective thriller with some good performances and a startlingly authentic look at a side of Boston rarely if ever seen on screen. Affleck reportedly took the same approach that David Simon used with HBO series The Wire in casting extras and some peripheral characters, picking out locals who wouldn't have to fake their Southie accents, trashy clothes, poses and beaten down faces. Indeed, a couple of Wire regulars appear in Gone Baby Gone (Omar as a cop), and that show's idea that the real cops -- the best cops -- spend part of every day walking their Baltimore beat, building relationships, is also part of what makes local boy Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) an effective private detective in the tightly knit enclaves of Boston.",8,1,2,14 August 2014
Southpaw," Very Entertaining Throughout
","Southpaw is a boxing drama lead by Jake Gyllenhaal as this was a film in which he needed for his career. It did decent at the box office and receive mixed to good reviews. The film is highly engaging and entertaining throughout and the main reason is the acting and performance of Gylleenhall, as we can see the emotions and pain he committed for this film. Although somewhat generic and filled with cliches in which we have seen in previous sports dramas, Southpaw still delivers on what it was meant to, as in an interesting and fully rich story. With these type of films, the criticism may be because they are predictable, and although true, the joy is watching the story unfold and see the performances. In short, Southpaw is a rare boxing film with heart, emotion and one which keeps entertained throughout.",8,1,1,18 January 2018
Ant-Man," Worst than I thought it would be
","Paul Rudd stars as ex-con Scott Lang, jailed for a lovably anti- corporate crime, now struggling to hold down a job and reconnect with his estranged daughter. Ant-Man nips nimbly back and forth between sizes, often within the space of a single leap. It's a peculiar superpower of which the film never quite gets the measure: bath-tub terrors and in-briefcase battles are fun, but action sequences in which Scott (Paul Rudd) mounts flying insects. Not great in action sequences, nor does the humor lasts. Instead, we're left pondering how much less engaging Rudd is than Robert Downey Jr, and how much more we laughed at the properly peculiar Guardians of the Galaxy. Ant-Man is another Marvel disappointment.",3,1,4,15 May 2016
21 Jump Street," One of a kind and it delivers
","Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum respectively play Schmidt and Jenko, two rookie cops assigned to a special unit in which all the officers go undercover as high school students in order to bust various crimes. The outfit's commanding officer (Ice Cube) orders the pair to find out who's pushing a deadly drug at a local high school. Jenko (Tatum), a popular slacker during his own high school days, looks forward to heading back to class, while Schmidt (Hill), who was a miserable nerd during that period, dreads it. But they unexpectedly find their social standings reversed, with Schmidt becoming known for throwing killer parties and Jenko hanging out with the chemistry set.The movie offers an acceptable number of hearty laughs (albeit most packed during the first half), yet what's most refreshing about the film is how it acknowledges its own narrative absurdities and retreaded tropes in a manner that's neither forced nor self-congratulatory (love the running gag about exploding vehicles). 21 Jump Street wears its cool comfortably, and its nerdiness just as effectively. Also includes a Johnny Depp cameo near the end in which he does not stay around for long (pun intended).*Rewatching 21 Jump Street a year later (12/20/13), my thoughts about the film are about the same. Not much I did not notice on my first viewing I picked up on my second viewing. What makes the film work is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, as well as the supporting actors. The comedy is still there and clever as well as the action (specifically more towards the second half of the film once they get themselves to the prom- the sequences steadily pick up). After all that, I am more looking forward to the sequel 22 Jump Street in 2014 and hope it is as good as 21 Jump Street, if not better!",8,0,1,19 October 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Drags for Certain Duration
","Captain America while begins. Now the image of an all-American soldier, Steve is dressed up in a star-spangled Captain America outfit and paraded around the country with dancing girls and a Hitler stand-in he repeatedly knocks down. The desire to fight for his country is still Steve's goal, however, and his rescue of friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and hundreds of other prisoners convinces gruff Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) that Steve will be an asset in the battle to stop emerging villain the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). There's time for a dash of romance, of course, with Hayley Atwell's British agent Peggy Carter falling for the muscular superhero.With its World War II setting and devilish German villains, Captain America immediately brings to mind Raiders of the Lost Ark and director Joe Johnston's earlier effort The Rocketeer. As composer Alan Silvestri does his best to emulate John Williams, the movie strains desperately to match the efforts of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones saga. Yet Captain America lacks the deft humor or breakneck Saturday morning serial momentum of Indy, instead delivering its outlandish premise in a dull, straight-faced and earnest manner.",5,1,1,18 January 2015
American Hustle," Flawed for a Certain Audience
","American Hustle (2013) tells the true story which can be seen as bizarre enough, yet it's clear from the outset that director David O Russell's primary touchstones are cinematic, most notably, Scorsese's Goodfellas as seen through the refractive prism of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, with a smidgen of Whit Stillman's The Last Days of Disco sprinkled in as seasoning. In terms of awards fodder , it also owes a debt to Argo, following its winning formula of handsome stars with outlandishly retro hair arrangements reliving American stories from the late 70s that are too implausible to be entirely made up. What makes the film work are the stellar Oscar nominated performances from the main cast, which is why American Hustle is a stellar yet over flawed film. For a rewatch 07/05/17' American Hustle is quite the film, as it's story and plot are quite confusing at times but overall the acting performances and chemistry from the cast is what makes it standout. It somewhat drags on and the story isn't very typical which is why we see such hate from casual film fans, calling this film 'boring' and 'overrated'",7,0,2,22 February 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," Jason Bourne at his peak
","The third film of the Bourne series shows more growth, and is assured more exciting with each successive installment. Firector Paul Greengrass continues to up the speed for this satisfying continuation to the saga of amnesiac spy Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). This film hits the ground running right alongside Bourne as he continues to evade his government ex-employers while searching for his true identity. This is one relentless chase from start to finish, with some terrifically suspenseful set pieces, expertly-staged smash-ups, and incredibly brutal fight scenes. As in the most previous installment, The Bourne Supremacy, Greengrass is a bit too enamored of the shaky, hand-held documentary-style camera work, rendering a lot of the action a bit too chaotic and dizzying visually, but that doesn't detract from the smart plotting, spot-on performances, action that ends this trilogy on a series-best note (at the time). Overall, we see Matt Damon portraying Jason Bourne at its peak as everything appears to click and the film is an over intending thriller",9,0,0,18 December 2017
Nightcrawler," Visually engaging and Stunning
","Nightcrawler is loosely based on an anti-hero starring Jake Gyllenhaal. As the film brightens, he genuinely looks like a creature of the night: pale, fleshless, with huge sunken eyes. He speaks calmly, but there's desperation in his gaze, and once he has you in his sights, he won't turn away. The film picks up where we see him driving home one night from his dead-end job, fossicking for scrap metal which he sells to a junkyard. Lou spots a couple of men with video cameras near a highway car crash. These are nightcrawlers, freelance reporters who cruise the streets of Los Angeles listening out for police radio reports of accidents and crimes, which they film in hope that the footage will be picked up by the morning news. Fired up, Lou buys a cheap camcorder and starts doing the same himself, finding a mentor in Nina (Rene Russo), a television producer who sees the grisly footage supplied by her protégé as a short cut to higher ratings.Many have considered that the character of Lou does not go fully crazy as compared to Christian Bale's character in American Psycho (as in over the top), which seemed to have been false advertised, but the film as a whole keeps you on your seat, and it flows very well. For a first time director, Dan Glroy has impressed many critics with his debut.",9,0,0,28 May 2016
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Comedy for acquired taste
","Popstar Never Stop Popping appeared to be a parody of many artists and popstars mockumentary style concert type films in music. This film shows a very realistic view point of how artists go through fame and shows the ups and downs of the music industry. The budget as relatively low but they made the film very much watchable and unique with all the cameos and extra stunts. One can tell they did their research and Adam Sanberg put a lot of effort into the making of the film. Having doubts of how exactly the film would, Never Stop Popping exceeded my expectations and was a lot better than expected. The film is quite short which works well in its favor as it does not overstay its welcome (meaning it doesn't drag on). The parodying of TMZ was another unique and funny aspect of the film. This film flopped which is a shame but nonetheless not surprising. Recommended for those who enjoy Lonely Island or are seeking a concert type comedy. As a rewatch 08/05/18' Popstar feels better and moves more smoothly on a second watch. Highly recommend as this film is quite overlooked but then again is for an acquired taste in comedy and music of sorts. Enjoy and don't take the film too serious.",8,1,3,4 November 2017
Oblivion," Overly long running and quite boring
","Oblivion is a sci-fi film summer blockbuster starring Tom Cruise. The audience there spends two hours in the year 2077 in a post apocalyptic corner of Earth in the company of computer-generated drones, supersize spacecraft and a mechanic who lives in a beautifully designed mansion 3000 feet in the air.Into the film, we can see that Cruise (Jack Harper) plays the last man on Earth. The film has its tend of storyline plots derivative from other films, where a war between humans and space invaders has left the planet, and the remainder of the race has decamped to a space station. Jack lives with a state-assigned girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) and maintains a fleet of machines guarding what's left of the world from further attack.Although Oblivion is visually stunning (had a major budget gone to use), the film tends to drag on quite a bit and rarely does anything of interest occur It is a slow paced film and for this kind of science fiction film it does not work, in my opinion. Comparing Oblivion to another Tom Cruise sci-fi/action film such Edge of Tomorrow, many can agree that Edge of Tomorrow is far more entertaining, has better writing and is overall a thrilling ride. As a rewatch 10/02/19' Oblivion has great visuals and is well done looking but the story is quite boring and confusing. Not much of interest in its story.",4,2,4,12 June 2016
American Pie," Enjoyable teen comedy
","American Pie follows four teens in their senior year of high school. After experiencing some daunting sexual experiences, they decide to create a pact that will increase their chances of scoring before the year ends. The four set a goal to lose their virginity on prom night, for the sake of their own good.This film has a near-perfect formula – a variety of characters that are evident in high schools (making the film easy to relate to), original and funny jokes that run throughout the entire duration, and an interesting conflict (if somewhat farcical). Could have been funnier though. Standout characters in the film are Jason Biggs as the protagonist Jim, Alyson Hannigan as the geeky Michelle (who has a hilarious obsession with telling anecdotes about band camp), Seann William Scott as the high school jock Stifler, and Eugene Levy as Jim's erudite yet slightly dim father.Although the beginning was great, the end was kind of a disappointment with satisfied. It was very much predictable that they would accomplish their goal yet you were interested in seeing how the story folds. American Pie's characters were high school seniors but they looked passable for college students. Overall after rewatching this film, I can surely agree that it is indeed the best of the series.",8,0,0,18 October 2009
Watchmen," Visually striking and Entertaining throughout
","Watchmen is seen as a very different and more adult-oriented superhero film genre than what we are mainly used to seeing. This film is set in an alternate 1985 United States, a nation on the brink of nuclear war with the USSR, and with Richard Nixon enjoying his fifth term as president. Although we weren't as familiar with or as enamored by the source material as some prior to the movie's premiere. Director Zack Snyder has also cast the film exceptionally well as the lead actors do their role. Mainly Jackie Earle Haley is the standout portrayed as Rorschach, while Patrick Wilson makes a strong impression as Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl. As well as Malin Akerman (Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre) play the two Watchmen who most enjoy being superheroes, and they run with it. This film is definitely filled with more adult content as in the tone is dark and moody, and not as happy settling as many past seen superhero films. Watchmen has a lengthy running time but there is much build up to certain scenes and characters that it is well worth the wait. Unfortunately this film was not a success at the box office (mainly in favor of the foreign market) that a sequel was not in the works. Well, as a stand alone film, Watchmen is visually stunning, filled with inept characters and a plot that is worth watching and waiting for. Watchmen, as many have said, is not a film for younger audiences and entertainingly not for everyone.",8,0,2,20 February 2017
The Bourne Identity," Great start to a successful franchise
","The Bourne Identity is the original and first film of the Bourne franchise. This film sets the tone and has a very unique and thrilling feeling towards it. Once the plot sets it and it becomes on the move, the film becomes an instant great entertainment. The plot and storyline is relentless, like a jigsaw puzzle, the pieces take time to form any kind of sense. Filled with gripping moments and enough thrills, The Bourne Identity is one of the best action thrillers. Matt Damon is great as Jason Bourne, whose loss of memory becomes less disturbing than the revelations he discovers about himself. Overall, the Bourne Identity does what it maintained to do, which after 15 years later has produced several more successful sequels.",7,0,0,14 December 2017
Hot Rod," One of the worst movies I have seen
","When this film came out back in 07' I remember looking at the trailer and thinking that it looked boring and plain stupid, but in a funny way. I've waited long to watch this film because I've expected it to be pretty bad. Well I've recently watched it and I was right. This film is pure garbage and one of the worst 'comedy' films I have seen. Those saying this film is 'so funny/hilarious' are probably under the age of 20 (possibly majority of teens). I tried watching this film on a positive note and open mind and was truly disappointed. I really don't see what the others who rated this a 10 saw in this film. It was terribly written, has a poor plot/storyline, bad acting and really lame jokes, also jokes that were really annoying and they continued to drag on. The characters were unfunny and unlikeable especially Rod. Also I noticed that the way Adam Samberg acted, he tried way too hard and tried acting like Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite. Adam's acting was horrible and way over the top. The rest of the cast acting wasn't all that great. The film is pretty boring considering its about a stuntman, and its really mostly idiotic and stupidly silly. Also very predictable. So I really wouldn't recommend any one to watch this trash. And for this to be currently rated 6.5 is a massive joke",1,6,19,22 September 2010
The Italian Job," Great heist film
","Those are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of thieves who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtually no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audience at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is throughout the film you will either say 'yeah right, like thats possible' or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, 'skinny Pete', you will know what I mean when you see it. As a rewatch 06.11.20' and nearly 10 years since the initial watch in September 2010, opinions remain the same. Great fun, entertaining and occasionally light heist film. There isn't strong bloody violence which made this film more in tone. Overall just as good as remembered, if not slightly better.",7,1,1,9 September 2010
Baby Driver," Uniquely blends action and music
","Baby Driver was one of the more surprise summer hits of 2017. Having no knowledge leading up to the film but seeing a massive amount of positive reviews from both critics and fans. This film delivers in both style, substance and is an overall great thrill ride. Baby Driver does feel refreshing comparing to other action films released in some time.The overall aspect with the music involving as a theme makes this film a top level notch better, as it adds a uniqueness we aren't accustomed to seeing.From the opening bank heist scene, we get a sense as to what this film will bring as it is engaging to watch. The character of Baby (played by Ansel Egort) is a great protagonist as he is easily likable, as we get to know his backstory more.The chemistry among the love interest works well. Also, Jamie Foxx and Kevin Spacey have similar roles to the ones in Horrible Bosses, but that does not make it any less fun., as they do make the film better. Foxx steals his scenes and when he arrives, the film gets better from that point on.Baby Driver moves at a great pace where it is constant entertainment, even in slower scenes there is something worth watching. This film lived up to its hype and was worth the watch.",9,1,1,17 April 2019
Justice League," Doesn't live up to the hype
","Not much to be said about this film and it's critical and box office failures. Being hyped since years before it's released and with further expectations after the release of Wonder Wonder (which was great), Justice League doesn't deliver and feels forced, dull and just not worth the wait.Weak and uninteresting plot and an unmotivated and forced villain. Some cheesy and off dialogue. The chemistry between the lead characters didn't seem right: Ben Affleck's Batman was dull, Superman (who isn't in it much) is a boring character, Wonder Woman was easily the highlight, Flash was awfully annoying, Aquaman was decent but wasted in screen presence, and Cyborg is a pointless character (we barely know much about him).Overall this film didn't have a great tone, some decent action scenes but off looking CGI. After watching the film, didn't left disappointed since already knew about the criticism but as a fan this wasn't great or as entertaining as it should have been.",3,0,5,1 June 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," Very disappointing and unsettling conclusion
","Like many have stated and has been widely considered, the Matrix film is a classic and has been spawn on and praised for generations. Then comes the Matrix Reloaded which was not quite at the level of the original, but that was expected seeing as how great and game- changing the original was. Though Reloaded is still entertaining and there is enough to like about this film, it continues the great relationships with Neo and Trinity and we still have the same great concept. Now within the third installment and conclusion of the series The Matrix Revolutions, this film has been criticized throughout and one can see why. The film as a whole is disappointing because it does not feel as a typical Matrix film compared to the previous two. Revolutions feels more of a bland video game based film or another completely different type bland action film. In the Matrix Revolutions, what is disappointing is knowing it's the finale of the series, and this is what the directors and writers came up with. There are some okay scenes but this film felt a little more mainstream and family friendly. Another reason why Revolutions is hated is because Neo isn't as focused in this film compared to the previous two. There is far too much time on the other minor characters and in the Zion levels. They simply aren't interesting and we do not care much about them. When we get to those scenes, this film drastically shifts and feels like a video game or action monster type film- and that is not what the Matrix is about. The previous two (specifically the original) were clever, suspenseful and made the viewers on their toes. In Revolutions, the suspense and build up is gone.The final showdown scene with Neo and Agent Smith was decent for what it was, as it was well directed and the special effects are brought in nicely. Though it feels almost bland in a way that this was the pay- off for the entire film. We all knew Neo was going to win, as the fight was well but rather predictable. Overall, the Matrix Revolutions is a disappointment and a sad mess.",3,1,1,18 February 2017
28 Weeks Later," Quality horror zombie movie
","After watching the original film 28 Days Later several years ago and enjoying parts of that, decided in watching the follow up. As a whole this sequel remains similar to the original but they added in a few American characters. This does feel a little more Hollywood, but that doesn't necessarily mean it suffers.The new characters here are quite more intriguing and the plot extends a little more. There are also a few more horror scares. This film does feel more violent where we see more gore. Although the ending was predictable it was enjoyable.Jeremy Renner in one of his earlier roles shines and steals his scenes. His presence makes this film a slight level above the original. Another thing is the tone is more suspenseful.",7,0,0,17 May 2020
The Village," Few creepy moments but nothing special
","Having seen almost all of M. Night Shyamalan's films but not seeing The Village, but hearing much praise (mainly from fans claiming how underrated and underappreciated the film is). The film offers several good ideas, but at times doesn't exactly live up to the expectations one had thought. Up until this point in his career, Shyamalan had directed the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. All of which one would consider to be better than The Village. Although the Village is most definitely better than both his next two films of the decade (Lady in the Water & The Happening). This isn't exactly a good sign as it showed he regressed.The concept seems relatively interesting but given it's little twists it wasn't nearly as great or grande of a twists as expected. It was relatively simple when thinking about it. Also somewhat silly and confusing. For instance, within part of the plot. Why would they allow Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard)- being blind to be the one find medicine to heal Lucious (Joaquin Phoenix) in the woods herself? Also the supposed twist involving Noah (Adrien Brody)- playing a mentally challenged character disguising himself with the costume of the 'woods creature' attacking Ivy in the woods was rather bizarre and questionable. What his intent of hurting her? If so why?The Village is most definitely more of character drama than a horror film, which many seem to despise as it was marketed as a horror. There are some creepy jump scares elevated with its horror tone and tense music. But as a whole, this film was at most times somewhat boring and rather lifeless.Bryce Dallas Howard was the highlight of the film as she was essentially the lead here, carrying the film for most of the second half. Which in a way is disappointing as Joaquin Phoenix's character is non-existent within the final forty-five minutes or so. Once his character gets stabbed by Adrien Brody, he is put aside and doesn't have any more speaking lines as we see him in about one or two more scenes 'healing'.Overall, the film had good ideas but it wasn't exactly handled well. Nothing completely amazing and once the supposed 'twist' is over, it wares off. Meaning this film possibly wouldn't be as good on a second and later viewings.",5,0,1,5 May 2020
21," Interesting take on a unique genre
","21 (2008) tells the true based story of a shy yet educated college student in need of a large sums of cash, within the heavy intent of becoming an amateur cards player. Also starring Kevin Spacey as he features as the dissolute professor who recruits the brightest minds at MIT to count cards for guaranteed profit. Only human error can break the winning streak. 21 stars Jim Sturgess as Ben Campbell. The film happens quickly and precise as the important moments of the film are present in a quiet manner. Ben immediately stands out in a class taught by statistician Mickey Rosa (Spacey), but when Mickey offers him the chance to win untold riches in the game of blackjack, Campbell declines on principle. It's only time will tell when fellow classmate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) and the steeply-rising price of college education, that Ben gets on board with the crew. 21 is seemingly interesting and entertaining but there appears to be several small flaws or parts that are rushed or not executed well. Altogether this film is quality for a one time watch.",7,1,1,24 March 2017
The Revenant," Visually an Experience
","The Revenant is based in part on the exploits of Hugh Glass where we see Leonardo DiCaprio as Glass, a Scots-American soldier in the early 19th century. Glass has son (Forrest Goodluck) by an absent native woman, and something about this, or his basic authority, triggers the bitter resentment of fellow hunting party member John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Quickly within several key moments of the film, wee see that Glass is suddenly mauled by a bear, and Fitzgerald wants to leave him behind. Later another member of the hunter's team Jim Bridger (Will Poulter) is somehow convinced to go along with that, although he later claims not to have understood Fitzgerald, and we believe him.The Renevant besides it's well visuals and great acting from the leads DiCaprio and Hardy, the films comes off rather boring and not as exciting or entertaining as a whole, as it is being praise for. Yes, the acting makes the film passable and the cinematography is well done, with great shots of the outside. Though in it's story arc, the film does not capitalize as it should. There were not many twists or turns which keeps the audience prepared and waiting for, unfortunately. Mainly due to the film's long running time (two hours 36 minutes), at certain points it becomes dull and almost predictable. The ending is quite well done, as expected.",7,0,1,22 February 2017
Pitch Black," Solid Sci-Fi Film
","Pitch Black includes a wide cast with its star coming a few moments afterwards and not making much of a presence, but once Riddick (Vin Diesel) enters, the film becomes better. Although I did not care too much for the supporting characters and thought they were in it a little too much in the beginning. If Pitch Black is a likable sci-fi thriller, it's because it has the heart of a '70s disaster movie beneath the horror trappings of computer-generated mutant bats and winged demon aliens.A spacecraft en route to a galaxy called New Mecca has an accident in mid-flight and must land on the hostile terrain of a scorching desert planet (it was filmed in Australia). Fry (Radha Mitchell), a junior pilot, is placed in command when the rest of her flight crew is killed. Just to show she's no Sigourney Weaver-like heroine, one of her first decisions is to jettison the ship's passengers to save herself. A solid sci-fi effort which one can see why people enjoy it.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/12/17' Pitch Black is a mildly entertaining and interesting sci-fi action film. As we can see why this film has spawned sequels, due to the character of Vin Diesel's Riddick. Although at times this movie is quite dull and not as fascinating visually in today's time compared to when it was released in 2000.",6,0,1,14 January 2014
Split," M. Night Shyamalan returns to his roots
","Split is the most recent release from M. Night Shyamalan, as well as his more polished and well put together film in a long while. What works from this film is mainly the acting and performance of lead James McAvoy, as we see him in his most disturbed and fate defying role of his career, portraying a various of different chatterers. As the film passes, we get a sense and become more attached and somewhat rooting for his turn. as well as the performance from his lead girl Casey held hostage. Split is intense, has thrills and is most of all very enjoyable. With another twist ending that has been praised for its connecting act, it most definitely leaves audiences in some sort of shock. Which was neither predictable or forced, and as of now we are anticipating the next directorial effort from Shyamalan. The opening two scenes set the tone for the entire film and from there it becomes a great experience. Highly recommend for those of fans of these somewhat type of films.",8,0,3,25 November 2017
American Psycho," One of a Kind Thriller
","American Psycho (2000) starring Christain Bale in one of his more prolific performances shows the true struggles are early greatness or his career. Bale portrays Patrick Bateman very well. He captures both the dashing confidence of Bateman's outer self and the nervous insecurity of the inner man. The wheels of Bateman's mind always seem to be turning, whether he's checking himself in the mirror or feeling stress about being found out.Although it doesn't appear some way or within the outer complex, the production design is also very good. Gideon Food, clothes, furnishings, even early-model cell phones, all have the aura of excess and indulgence about them that is called for in this movie. American Psycho can still to the modern day be recognized as a great piece of film making. As a rewatch 09/28/19' American Psycho remains a quality thriller.",7,0,0,19 July 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," More of a drama than comedy
","I recently watched Little Miss Sunshine a while ago and remembered it being getting many critical reviews and success. The film is billed and titled a comedy but its really not. Its much more of a drama. Their may be some comedic moments where people are supposed to laugh at but I didn't. Especially since it dealt with some more serious issues (drugs, suicide attempt, beauty, etc.) Though the story was very well written and the characters were developed. Also this film is very much about a great message which is one of the reasons why its rating is high and it got many positive reviews. There were many strange moments many including the grandma. Some were him telling some 'advice' to the son- Dwayne. Also there's a real dramatic and awkward scene. SPOILERS! It happens when they figure out that the grandpa passed away so they go to the hospital. Later they get more problems and they sneak the grandpa's body out the hospital bed and put him in the trunk of the VW.I found many things to be somewhat unnecessary in this film like some of the issues. Some things like learning that Frank (Steve Carell) attempted to kill himself because of his gay lover. I felt like they didn't need to make his character gay at all. No real point, just for interest of the audience I guess. Also they made the father- Richard (Greg Linnear) obsessed with winning and forcing it on his daughter- Olive (Abigail Breslin). The mother- Sheryl was more crazy and bizarre, also a smoker and somewhat disrespectful to her daughter. The son- Dwyane (Paul Dano) was at first creepy but pleading not to speak then he has an outburst toward the end of the film. Also they said he was colourblind. That also was something that was just added for audience pleasure (wasn't very necessary). But thats what made the story more interesting and gave more sympathy for the characters. They made the characters all come together and really appreciate one another. So in general the film is very well written but could have done better had it been more comedic and less dramatic.",7,0,0,15 September 2010
Knowing," Creative and Entertaining
","Knowing is a mystery sci-fi film Starring Nicolas Cage as an astrophysicist who believes a 50-year-old time capsule, dug up at his son's school, contains a child's note that is a doomsday prophecy. Knowing has been compared to earlier films of M. Night Shyamalan (Signs, The Happening). It also boasts spectacular special effects that are well woven into the film that immediately boosts the film above average. Knowing does remind of other earlier film such as Signs, The Happening, and the Final Destination series.Nic Cage does a great job as the leading role as he is convincing playing these characters. It's never a stretch for him to play an obsessive madman, yet Cage brings a haunted quality to this character, whose wife's recent death left him feeling sure there is no meaning or order in the world. In another actor's hands, it might seem ridiculous that a brilliant MIT scientist instantly buys into random predictions, but Cage convinces us his intense, grieving character is desperate for something to believe in, even if it's the scribblings of a Mary Jane-wearing, fifth-grade Nostradamus. The film's first half is great and gripping, unfortunately the film drives off into strange territory into the final 20 minutes. It becomes quite over the top and loses several interests. Although it is unpredictable, the complete ending could have been better.
===
As a rewatch 03/28/18' Knowing remains an interesting and entertaining watch, although there are its faults, which are within the last part of the film. As if the writers tried coming up with something completely different which swayed away from what original was happening. The film takes itself somewhat too serious but overall it remains a good and engaging watch.",7,0,0,13 June 2016
U-571," Not interesting

Besides Matthew McConaughey's character, couldn't recall any of the other characters names, which meant they weren't too interesting and were forgettable. Sone decent shots but wasn't as thrilling or intense as thought it would be. Was zoning out through most of the second half as it became rather boring.",2,0,2,25 July 2019
"I, Robot"," I enjoyed it !!!!!
","I decided to watch this movie because I've heard many great things about it by my fellow friends for years, and I never got the real chance at seeing it. So I decided to watch it on television last night, and I found it to be great.Its about a guy named Del Spooner (Will Smith) who is a detective that does not trust robots even though everybody else believes them to be one hundred percent safe and trustworthy. When an old friend apparently commits suicide and leaves a holographic note for him he suspects foul play and the only being in the room at the time it happened was a robot. The robot doesn't help its case when it flees the scene in apparent breech of its core programming. Spooner is helped in his investigation by Susan Calvin who doesn't share his suspicions about robots in general but realises that there is something different about this particular robot. As the investigation continues it becomes clear that there is a greater threat than one rogue robot.The acting is pretty good and the special effects are decent although obviously CGI. There was some rather obvious product placement which I could have done without although not enough to spoil the film.Will Smith does a great job in this. I like his character's role. If you like sci-fi action I'm sure you'll enjoy this. So Id recommend this movie, it ain't too late to see it.Can't wait for I, Robot 2
=========
As a rewatch 04/12/18' and over 8 years since the initial watch, opinions remain nearly the same. The film is entertaining to the fullest and very intriguing and engaging. Will Smith showed his box office and star powers in this film as it is essentially a one-man show (not as much as I Am Legend). Overall, I, Robot delivers thrills, great sci-fi action and has a very thought provoking message and plot. We remember the constant rumors of their being a sequel, and it is disappointing a sequel was never given.",8,1,2,27 February 2010
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Visually stunning and exceeds expectations
","Having heard much praise about this film since its release and seeing its high ratings on both Rotten tomatoes and Metacritic, and seeing as it was nominated for several Oscars (and won one). Expectations were only set quite high.After watching this film, can safely say that these expectations were met. First off the visuals are top notch, the colours are flashy and bright, and the overall animation is incredible. The story is written well and is pretty clever, not just a typical Spider-Man film. The different Spider-People were a nice touch seeing them from these different dimensions, and they were all quite likeable, unique and different. The main older 'past prime' Spider was probably the best, in terms of content, and the voice work by Jake Johnson stood out. Initially did not know he was the voice but during the film, figured it was him.The action and pacing is also really well done, as the film doesn't get boring and even during its slower scenes, the dialogue is either witty or the music soundtrack plays accordingly and fits in perfect with the image of the film. This is one complaint I have seen from people, saying they did not like the type of hip-hop being played throughout the film and how it was too much, but it fits with the narrative and stereotype. Most of all it works.One negative is that the film could have actually been longer. The run time is less than two hours and the end credits are over 11 minutes long. So the film is really about 1 hour 45 minutes. Also the Uncle Aaron could have had more screen time as he was an interesting character. Otherwise this was a really well done film and one of the best animated films of its time.",10,0,1,1 August 2019
Over the Hedge," Great animated movie
","Im not that big a fan of animated movies but this one was really well done. I was totally surprised at how good this movie was, now i've seen a few of the kids movies but not that many, and this was better than any animated movie that i have seen. Loved the actors/actresses who they got to do the voices here, Bruce Willis, perfect choice, Eugene Levy, Gary Shandling,, William Shatner, and yes Avril Lavigne.The plot line was very good and unique as well. Its about RJ the squirrel(Gary Shandling) who steals food from a bear then gets caught so he has to make up for his stolen food that eventually gets away. RJ has 7 days to get all of the food back before the bear get's up from hibernation.. bear woke up early cause the squirrel made such a racket to steal the bear's food. RJ then goes into suburbia on the other side of the hedge to join up with some of the other animals who were in hibernation to help him with his plan. He then later meets Verne the turtle (Bruce Willis) and the rest of his 'family' (other animals though-not really family)and easily tricks them to help him find food into people houses so he can repay the bear. At first Verne didn't trust RJ but eventually cane around. RJ's plan works out at the end but Verne eventually finds out whats RJ's real problem.I love the scene with the exterminator when he's putting the traps in the backyard. The owner of the house Gladys acts like a real bit**, i mean she's paying the exterminator pretty much to set up deadly traps to kill the animals that she spotted.At the end, she finally gets what she deserves because Gladys and the exterminator land on one of the traps and they blow up (literally), so does the bear which was chasing RJ for the food. Afterwards the bear ends up going away and Gladys end up going to jail because she has an illegal trap on her lawn.Great movie, its definitely worth checking out",9,0,0,21 January 2009
Wanted," Mindless action
","Having watched this movie around when it was released and having mostly forgotten about it, but remember enjoying it and hoping for a sequel, decided to watch it again and noticed more things on this viewing than when first watched it a decade or so ago.This film is based on a comic book series and it seems that many of the negative reviews don't understand its concept or purpose. Much criticism is how unrealistic the film is, with the bullets curving or some other stunts but that was merely on purpose and what makes this film stand out. It may be more style over substance but there is enough mindless action entertainment to enjoy. James McAvoy in one of his earlier leading roles is well liked and was a great choice for the lead. Along with the supporting cast of Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman.Featuring several twists along the way, as one had forgotten on this viewing but afterwards had felt it served its purpose and worked. A lot of negative hate seems to come from the fact tat people were expecting a different type of film. This wasn't supposed to be James Bond, or Jason Bourne, or Die Hard. It has its purpose and it pulls it off. Only a shame is how they never made a sequel.",7,1,2,22 August 2019
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," over-hyped
","OK so I decided to watch this movie because many of my friends had seen it and said some good things about it. They said its much better than the 1st Madagascar so I decided to watch it. I've seen the first one, and loved it. Madagascar 2 is boring and lame, it had some decent moments but seriously its not that funny. I like the beginning more than the ending. And many of the jokes in this movie were 'adulted'. The penguins and lumors had most of them. I guess its somewhat interesting and entertaining but I was expecting more. It may be my fault because I watched this on the internet and had lots of distractions, I had many long breaks which caused the movie to overflat...but anyways, I think the movie could have been better and funnier",6,0,0,12 August 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Different take on the original
","Watching this sequel after the original Terminator film and can see the differences between both films. Seven years after the original was released, this follow up does feel more 'family friendly' and more 'Hollywood' due to its much larger budget. The original was darker and we see Arnold's Terminator as the villain while in this movie they slightly changed (or modified) his character to be a hero.Judgement Day is noticeably longer with more details to the plot and it does make it work. Though this movie does feel more watered down, to gear towards a wider audience (mainly with the addition of a child in John Connor playing a major role). His character is quite annoying with his constant cursing and his acting wasn't quite great.Within the violence is still strong with weapons slicing through people's head at point blank and much shootouts and car/building explosions.Although the concept was slightly confusing at points, mainly with the timelines and such but overall the film was thoroughly entertaining and has one thinking afterwards.",9,1,1,28 October 2019
Salt," A fun and entertaining movie
","Angelina Jolie's latest film is this action spy thriller titled Salt. That the title of the film and her character's name. Seems like a carbon copy of a female Bourne movie. At first I didn't know what to expect from this film but I read many reviews, positive and negative and I finally got around to seeing this film. I thought it was pretty well done, the action scenes were great but the plot was predictable and kind of hard to believe. Though its on of those movies that make you feel excited with action, and it delivers. Granted it was a summer action flick to rack in a ton of cash, and it succeeded in doing so.Many things I like and disliked in this film. The only real issue that I have is that the film didn't fully explore the protagonist's inner psyche. There are some flashbacks that tell flesh out the character, but a little bit more would've been nice in addition to more exposition surrounding her character. Also, I felt the film should've been longer. The notion of a female spy is an exciting and intriguing idea. They should have added an extra 20 mins to the film but overall it was good. It is 100 mins (1hr, 40mins) but it had about 7 mins of end credits, so it was really closer to 90 mins. I personally think it they extended a few scenes, it would have been better. But it is what it is, and it was pretty decent in general. Also the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel and I for one can't wait to see what they come up with next. It's not as cerebral as the Bourne films, but it will entertain you for an hour and a half. Give and take the price of what its worth, that's a good deal. ==================================================================== ======== As for a rewatch (07/19/17') this film is still quite an entertaining spy thriller. Though some things do not feel as good upon a second review. Perhaps the film did not age well, considering since it's release there have been better films of this kind of genre. Things are messy in the second half and do require of paying close attention. Also some of the twists and turns aren't as clever as I'd remember. Rating change from 7 to 6.",6,2,6,27 August 2010
We're the Millers," Certain Extent Comedy
","We're The Millers blends forms of comedy into one, as the film works for several reasons. Although predictable, it is entertaining, and some of the comedic jokes do work well. The chemistry is there as we see the cast come together as one family towards the end. What works in the movie is its offensive and raunchy comedy, a type of comedy that most often just goes horribly wrong. The entire cast is simply fantastic at making the gross out stuff work and even better at delivering the site gags. Sudeikis is obviously the core of the group, but it's Poulter who steals the show as the half-witted fake son with a heart of gold. Anniston and Roberts are both fine on screen. Anniston as well plays her part convincingly to some extent.",7,0,1,7 March 2015

The self-pitying Kale wallows in the distractions of iPods, video games and digital cable until his angry mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) cuts him off from all things electrical.Disturbia then turns into a throwback to typical late 80/90's stalker films where the suspense is brought into over the top suspension of disbelief.

","Led by director David O Russell (The Fighter), and delivered by great performances from the Oscar Nominated leads (Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De Niro), Silver Linings Playbook works brilliants.The film skates over issues of mental illness, only starts to get going with the belated introduction of Jennifer Lawrence (about 25 minutes in), and ultimately follows a relatively conventional rom-com flightpath. But there are times when it does something new with the genre — and it does make you care about the protagonists. As great as he is a writer, Russell's direction is as fantastic as always. If there's one thing that can be said, even in his weaker entries, he's always had a knack for extracting terrific performances out of all of his actors. The lead character on paper is only as good as his actor, and Bradley Cooper expresses every believable ache out of Pat Jr. Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver are typically strong as his parents, while Chris Tucker works with a nice little comic relief in his brief role.Why the film works besides the directing is the story. It is fascinating seeing Cooper act as a mental patient wondering his way through his everyday life, as well as Jennifer Lawrence playing a mysterious browser. Silvers Lining Playbook is disguised as a rom- com but it is much more than your typical Hollywood fare. You are rooting for the characters in the end, as even though it may be somewhat predictable, the way it all unfolds is worth the watch. ==================================================================== ====== As for a rewatch (07/04/17') Silver Linings Playbook is more fun and entertaining on another viewer. There is more clues and little hints and as an overall watch it really becomes a much better feel to the film. The performances and chemistry of the leads are what set this film apart making it magical. One of David O'Russell's best films.",9,2,3,23 December 2013
Divergent," For fans of the novel
","Divergent has been compared to other best selling film adaptation before it such as the Hunger Games. Having no prior knowledge about the Divergent film series, one would not be as disappointing if did not enjoy the film. This film is best suited and aimed for those fans that enjoy films as the Hunger Games, Twilight or Maze Runner, and we can see why. As these are more teenage, young adult based theme films. The Divergent Series has done well box office wise which is why it is a trilogy. About the film, the effects and visuals as well done, the presence and lead portrayal of Shailene Woodley is good as she is a likable lead to root for. Divergent is quite long and seems to drag at times though there are some scenes of entertainment in general. It is quite predictable and not as suspenseful or thrilling as one had assumed. Towards the end half, the film plays out more like a romance love story (as we all saw the romance between Tris and Four happening) in which it starts to go slowly downhill and become a little more boring in regards. The film also doesn't show as to why there are fractions of the world split, we are just to assume something happened in the beginning. Dystopian futuristic movies have a certain praise as we enjoy, but without much detail, it becomes a little wondering as to why. In general the film features a lot of stunts, jumping around, running, fighting and other forms of survival.",5,1,3,23 July 2017
Monsters vs. Aliens," Surprisingly an amusing film!
","I was somewhat surprised tat I enjoyed this film as much as I did. I didn't really have high expectations before watching this but I ended up enjoying quite much. It was actually very funny, and the special effects were nice (though I didn't see it in 3D). It was much more different than other animated movies from recent. Unlike the others, this one has more action and better humour.The characters in general were pretty good and funny. Though I strongly disliked the lead female Susan. He was very stereotypical and cliché and she was selfish. IMO she was more selfish than her boyfriend who she accused of being selfish. I hated the whole 'woman can do things without a man' thing was laid on pretty thick. Her act was soo clichéd and typical. At first when she became a giant, she wanted to be back normal sized, then once she finally got turned back normal, she wanted to go back to being a giant..how predictable. And for Derrick, he had reasons for not wanting to be with her after she became a giant, yet she couldn't understand that and she got mad real fast. Her attitude and personality wasn't all that great. BOB (Seth Rogen) stole the show, he was the best part. His character was hilarious throughout. The other characters were pretty nice too (the cockroach prof., missing like, the evil Galaxar). The graphics were quite pretty, and that final fight scene was something to behold. Overall I really enjoyed this film, so id recommend it to others!",8,1,2,27 August 2010
She's the Man," funny movie!
","She's the man is a very funny and entertaining movie. When i first saw the trailers and read the bad reviews, i thought that this would be another teen flicky where Amanda Bynes makes a complete buffoon out of herself...I was wrong, this movie is hilarious from start to finish. There were many funny scenes and weird things happening. This is a really good movie to check out, i recommend this to people that know how to watch movies. One of the funniest parts in the movie is when Amanda Bynes (Viola dressed as Sebastien) is playing soccer with her team and the ball hits her under the belt really hard. She doesn't react how a guy would if he got a ball hit him in the nuts hard. Then everyone just stops and wonders whats wrong with Viola (dressed as Sebastien)...after wards she then reacts hilariously and over does it...very funny movie though. The ending is also funny...filled with surprises. Its definitely worth watching!",7,0,0,7 October 2008
Spider-Man," Great film adaptation of Spiderman
","Spiderman is a very common superhero comic book adaptation turn into movie. I remember precisely when this movie first came out, I was somewhat skeptical about seeing it but I finally gave in and was surprised of how good it was and how faithful it was to the comic book. The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. The story starts basically on a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst).This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily. My only gripe is I could do without the weak one-liners that appear once and awhile in the movie. All in all fans of the comic book as well as the cartoon series wont be disappointed. I liked how it seemed and how it connected to those.
===
As a rewatch 04/01/19' opinions remain relatively same about Spider-Man. Having not watched this film for nearly 8 years, much memory had been forgotten about this film. As it was nice to rewatch this film after watching both TASM (2012) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) for sake of comparisons and differences. This Spider-Man is relatively a simply origin story as it does stay true o the comics. The film's pace is at ease and has an enjoyable feel, as well as a turn of emotions.The film isn't too depressing, but is filled with enough joy and fun moments that it makes the end worthwhile. In comparison to TASM, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is easier to root for as he is far more likable in a sense where we can see his struggles more clearer. We also see where the chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst begins, as it folds naturally. The villain of the Green Goblin is a worthy character for a starter villain. The action is well done, there are some decent comic reliefs scenes and the ending does leave us wanting more.",8,0,1,19 September 2010
Jarhead," Somewhat generic but has its moments
","Jarhead (2005) the war drama film starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx, sees a group of marines and their quest search in battle. The film at the time seemed to have been praised widely but as time has passed and now over a decade since it's release, this film doesn't seem as great as it was when it came out. Reason being, there have been many more quality and better war/marines/solider films such as Jarhead.Though this film is not bad, it somewhat feels generic and lacking of complete emotional balance. The performances are their but the general tone of the film seems to resemble and MTV based film rather than a serious awards type film (such as the Hurt Locker or Hacksaw Ridge). Also mentioned that this film is not just a War film, it is able to mix some comedy and drama, with such issues as Mental health. The cinematography is great and Sam Mendes' direction is holds up but in general, something about the film feels lacking.",5,4,5,4 September 2018
Collateral," Mixes well crime, drama and action
","Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a unique and intelligently well done film by great director Michael Mann. In this hostage story, the script is on thin ice though the actors and writing make it work well, and better than it should have been. The plot requires that Max and Vince stay together, even though it is in Max's best interest to try to get away. Blackmail, extortion, and bribery would all be just contrived enough to ruin a script. Vince is a professional and Max is an expert at driving in L.A. whose life is on the line. The script needs to be at least as smart as both men. Luckily there are no glaring holes in the logic, and Max very nearly manages to get away from Vince on a couple of occasions. What makes the film great, other than the visuals is of course the acting from the leads Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Rarely has Cruise been the second or co-lead in his films and rarely does he portray a villain, but in Collateral he delivers one of his finest performances. He blatantly steals the film and delivers on every scene he is in. For a film running at 2 hours, it has a great pace and does not feel boring or slow. Right from the beginning, we are engaged and interested in the story and the characters. The ending is not quite as expected but also not too unpredictable, but it is a well delivered ending to a great film.",9,0,2,20 June 2016
Dunkirk," Lacking in depth
","Being a fan of Christopher Nolan's films and enjoying his other films, one was anticipating the arrival of Dunkirk. Released in 2017 and being an instant hit at the box office and seeing mostly overwhelming positive critics reviews, the anticipation got somewhat higher.As a film, Dunkirk is relatively great directed and has great visuals in cinematography, as it is well to look at. And the camera angles work well. The film is somewhat disappointing and boring in depth. There were many characters but hardly we get invested in.The film felt slightly longer than its runtime. As a film, it just didn't grab the attention and wasn't as entertaining as lead to be. Most of the film as a whole just felt slow and boring at times. Quite overrated simply because Christopher Nolan directed it.",3,3,5,17 April 2019
The Machinist," Memorable From Start to End
","The Machinist (2004) has been an on top film for several years. The Machinist concentrates on the psychological aspect of Bale's character in a way that the viewer can almost experience his decline. Not many films have successfully portrayed this type of character particularly in such an entertaining way.Although the character has been described as unlikable or repulsive, I found him to be human and as such had no judgement.The Machinist appears to moves at a medium pace and is thoroughly enjoyable. There are some obvious nods to Hitchcock's Psycho, and also to famous literature (of which I am not familiar). I did not think that these links were necessary and believe that they detract very slightly from the movie itself. Also instead of spelling out certain elements of the plot, the film could have benefited by a little ambiguity. The Machinist keeps its audience on its seat from its great pace and use of suspense. The visuals are equally as stunning and the conclusion is really well written. As a rewatch 05/13/20', very solid film and remains one of my favorite Christian Bale films and performances. Although after another watch, the twist regarding Ivan comes off as more predictable and obvious. This film was also relatively short. Perhaps had they made it 30 more minutes and gave more details, the overall reception and cult effect would have been stronger, similar to Fight Club in a way.",10,0,1,3 February 2015
Bad Teacher," Not much of a comedy
","Bad Teacher is one of those comedies that terribly misjudges the reverse appeal of its central character. Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth, a middle-school teacher who's only serving time until marriage releases her from the necessity of doing anything but pamper herself. Then her fiancé breaks up with her and she has to begin her seduction scheme all over again, getting a fake-boob job and making contact with colleague (Justin Timberlake). Lucy Punch plays a bright-spark teacher who becomes her rival. What the film fails to see is that Elizabeth's not 'bad' in a funny way – she's venal, grasping, rude, lazy and ignorant. Loathsome, in fact, and not funny. Jake Kasdan, once a promising director, doesn't have a clue how to make it work. The trailers have made the film seem it was more comedy oriented. ==================================================================== ==================================================================== ======As a rewatch (09/14/17') opinions remain same for film. Cameron Diaz does carry the film but overall not much humor is in the film as it isn't as funny, more so mean spirited and predictable. Although some entertaining scenes.",3,23,44,18 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Solid Reboot with its share of flaws
","Following Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, many were eager and anxious as to what they would do with this reboot. Having waited a while to see the Amazing Spider-Man, I noticed the similarities as well as the flaws. I am not exactly sure yet how I truly feel about the film. There were its positives such as some action scenes, the chemistry between the leads, and the overall feel (was meant to be taken more serious, had a strong darker tone). As well as some of the negatives, flaws or things I did not care for too much such as Peter Parker being slightly unlikable throughout (how he treated his aunt, uncle, etc.), the way in which his uncle Ben died (did not think this was well done), how easy it was for Gwen (Emma Stone) to fall for him, as well as scenes later on involving the main villain- the Lizard.Now there are striking noticeable differences between Tobey Maguire's Spider-man portrayal to Andrew Garfrield's Spider-Man. Maguire played his part as more as an outcast social nerd likable and relatable nice guy, while Garfield was looked as more as a loner punk skater who showed his share of emotion and teenage anxiety. Garfield did have a sense of 'nerd-like' personality but it faded away as the story went on. Both of their portrayal's work for their films and it is obvious as to why they specifically wrote Garfield's Peter Parker to be more edgy. Had they made the same similarities, people just would have complained that they were too similar.Unlike many people, I didn't really care for the Lizard as the villain and found the way it happened to be rather weak. It was a basic rehash of Spider-man (2002), the typical scientist experimenting with chemicals then one goes wrong and ends up within his body type routine. Though I did enjoy some of the fight scenes involving Spider-Man and the Lizard. They were really well done, specifically the scene where Peter goes down in the sewer as he is patiently waiting for the Lizard to show up, then as he does, they start fighting. As well as when the Lizard comes to find Peter at his school and havoc breaks out. The camera shots and sequences are neatly done. Their finale is also what puts it atop, which includes them fighting outside on top on the lab, then going in the balcony. We see several hits back and forth as it is realistic. Though in this scene towards the end, is where the father of Gwen shows up only to be injected, and as it happens he supposedly passes. He then tells Peter his one wish to not continue dating his daughter. Only to find out by the ending, is what we see.I enjoyed the cast of Sam Raimi's trilogy better as I feel we saw the potential played out, and their parts were equally great. The CGI was more polished and I did like the Spider-Man outfit in TAS better than the originals. Also the way the web shots were done, I found them better. All in all, the Amazing Spider-man is a very solid addition to the franchise, and we are all waiting patiently for the sequel.As a rewatch 07/10/17' opinions on the film remain the same. Andrew Garfield portrayal's of Spider-Man was intended to make him different from Tobey MaGuire's version and it was. Overall solid film.For a third viewing 03/30/19', and watching this film directly after watching Spider-Man: Homecoming, there are very noticeable changes and differences in this film compared to Homecoming. This film felt more dramatic, much lesser fun and less exciting in tone and overall more depressing as opposed to Homecoming (which is obvious given the deaths in the Amazing). In a way this film had an 'indie' feel, which I have not noticed much before but am sure people have. Both Peter Parkers/Spider-Man were different completely in character. However, this film does remain quality (take it for what it is, it's supposed to be different compared to Raimi's Spider-Man film) but in comparison to Homecoming, that film does have a more natural and fun vibe.",7,1,3,4 December 2013
The Lego Movie," Visual Stunning Piece
","The Lego Movie has been cult well among many fans, as a great visual experience, and the film can be seen as living to its expectations. It might seem like a reach to base a film essentially on a series of plastic blocks, but this 3D animated comedy has some visual inspiration behind it, even if the big laughs aren't quite plentiful enough to carry a feature-length production. The story essentially follows the misadventures of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego construction worker who stumbles on to a diabolical attempt at world domination by President Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchmen led by a two-faced cop (Liam Neeson). So Emmet turns from social outcast to unlikely hero as he teams with Batman's girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) and a blind man (Morgan Freeman) who dispenses pearls of wisdom in an effort to save the day. Overall, a very well made film which has been in production for several years back.",8,0,1,29 March 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," Excelled by Great Performances
","Dallas Buyers Club starring Matthew McConaughey in an Oscar winning performance, showcases the actor as a greatly transformation done correctly. Given 30 days to live, Woodroof (McConaughey) does his homework and sets about rustling up substances with a better chance of offering him a reprieve than the treatment to which the FDA has given its blessing. Research alerts him to the existence of unapproved but effective substances, which he's forced to smuggle in from Mexico and other countries. The films creators play fast and loose with the facts and make up one central character altogether. Jared Leto is spectacular in the role of Rayon, a cross-dressing AIDS victim with whose help Woodroof starts selling virus-fighting cocktails out of a seedy motel. Based on a true story, which is every bit told come the film's conclusion.",8,0,0,18 October 2015
The Fast and the Furious," One of a kind of the series
","There's a good love story wrapped around the manifolds and superchargers.Its about a series of truck high-jacks has brought in a squad of undercover cops to deal with the problem and they do so by sending Officer Brian Earl Spilner (real name Brian O'Conner) (Paul Walker) to infiltrate the number one racing clan. It's led by Dominic 'Dom' Toretto (Vin Diesel), the fastest and strongest among 'em. O'Conner starts his quest by demonstrating his hangup with speedy metal, then by hanging around Dom's bar, which Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) runs and bartends. In the course of events he loses his ride, saves Dom's life and some embarrassment, hooks up with Mia, and learns to respect Dom in ways he never expected.The racing sequences are brought off with considerable energy and as an expression of this culture but are weakened by a plot device contrived to give the races and the racers a dynamic advantage. The movie had a decent plot but the writing and dialogue was poor. Many people consider the first one the best of the series and I agree with them on some levels. Though had the writing and dialogue been better, this film would have been much better. Also they could have used better character development and better acting. Its a film centered at a specific group. Meaning not for everyone. As a rewatch 06/03/19', the original Fast and the Furious shows how everything was set up. A solid debut and shows the early stages of how this become a dynasty in the making.",7,3,4,8 September 2010
Now You See Me," Enough Thrills and Suspense
","Now You See Me tells the story of four magicians who rob banks while performing shows and then disperse their loot to their audiences. Now You See Me contains several twists and turns which this one will keep you interested and curious throughout and when you started thinking they already performed tricks and there is nothing more than they come out with new tricks and yes there is a reason behind that why they are doing this that you should see yourself. However, I definitely felt the movie was lacking and it also had its flaws. Character development was almost nonexistent. I was definitely disappointed that we didn't get to see much of the four illusionists and learn more about them, but i still enjoyed the movie and all of its plot twists. Like any other heist movie, the plot is quite complex and the addition of some unexpected plot twists made it even more enjoyable for me. In spite of its imperfections, it still makes for a very entertaining movie.",8,0,1,18 October 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Lives Up to Expectations
","X-Men: Days of Future Past was a highly anticipated film and sequel to X-Men: First Class in 2011. This film begins sometime in the near future, we see a scorched landscape controlled, it seems, by autonomous machines. Mutants are the enemy and the machines have evolved to the point where no one is safe. A battle is still raging with several familiar mutant heroes fighting, mostly in vain, to gain a foothold against the frightful Sentinels. But all is not lost, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) hatch a plan to send the consciousness of one of the team back into the past. In doing so, the hope is that, armed with knowledge of a possible grim future, the wrongs can be righted and new present can be created.The main highlight of the film is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose unique healing powers prove to be very useful when it comes to tripping the time travel continuum. Falling back into the 1970s, Wolverine must convince a jaded and alcoholic, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to join forces with Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and change the future.While not nearly as much fun as the last adventure that effectively rebooted the franchise, 'Days of Future Past' has more narrative weight. The metaphor for racism that the mutant struggle represents is not lost as the United States recovers from the regretful setbacks in Vietnam and is forced confront a new Cold War menace. Enter Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), who has developed a machine that can detect the presence of a mutant. Once identified, Trask's solution to the mutant problem is to kill them. This terribly heavy-handed approach is a one of the film's narrative failings, especially considering that it does away with all judicial process that is one of the bedrock fundamental rights all American's share. Trask hints that mutants aren't even human, rather, they are a completely different species. One can logically imagine that that means no trials and the death penalty is okay. ==================================================================== ====== As a rewatch 07/07/17' X-Men: Days of Future Past remains perhaps the best X-Men film to date. Having all the great elements which made it great as it combines everything into one. This film works great because they focus on one main plot (unlike Apocalypse) and there aren't a loaded amount of characters. It is much more intense, thrilling and overall entertaining in comparison to Apocalypse after rewatching that as well. Also, the characters of Magneto, Mystique and Beast appear to be more engaged and aggressive where as in Apocalypse they seemed slightly bored. Rating changed from 9 to 10/10",10,0,1,22 October 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Top notch Superhero film
","The third film in the Captain America series sees more of an ensemble cast and less of a Captain America film. Though this may be such a bad thing in hindsight. Things only get uglier between these groups when Captain America's old pal-turned fugitive the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is accused of killing civilians, and the Avengers' leader, believing his friend is innocent, helps him escape.Once settled further into the film, there are a lot of side stories to Civil War. And really, nearly two-thirds of the film is just a setup to the big payoff. That super powered conflict in the film's title. And when it arrives, it doesn't disappoint, as a retired Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), an 'I'm just happy to be here' Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), a newly teenage Spider-Man (Tom Holland) in his first major fight, and movie screen newcomer Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) join the fray. Their five-on-five battle may seem like CGI overkill, but directors brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, who directed arguably Marvel's best film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, know how to stage the war. The film does feel quite long but it is needed to be seeing how many more characters there are. For an entertainment value, Captain America: Civil War lives up to its expectations and it delivers. As a rewatch 07/06/17' this latest Captain America film feels more relaxing and adjusts as more to an Avengers film, but in a way that isn't much of a problem. The clear highlight is with the 12 Avengers coming together and battling out with each other on the city's rooftop for a lengthy awaited battle.",9,1,3,12 February 2017
Ocean's Eleven," Stylish and highly entertaining
","Ocean's Eleven (2001) is one of the more stylish and most elegantly filmed movies from its time. This film may well be the best of the franchise, in terms of overall plot, style, substance, and entertaining factor. Although Ocean's Thirteen is quite well made. All the actors play their roles well, lead by George Clooney as the title character, as well as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia. The pacing of the film is solid as everything appears to be there, and with a large cast, we are to see them all perform. Director Steven Soderbergh seemed to have fun making this movie. He shot this film very intimately often allowing the camera to stay close on the actors a tad longer than expected which lets their personas shine through their personalities draw you into the movie as much as the caper itself. It's not often you see a movie where the direction has as much wit and cleverness as the plot itself. All together, Ocean's Eleven makes no pretense to be something other than a clever heist movie.",8,1,2,30 April 2017
Tropic Thunder," Pointless and Disappointing
","Tropic Thunder is a movie that I felt very disappointed and confused. I saw the good reviews on IMDb and other places and thought it was going to be that great yet when I saw it, it was kinda boring and unfunny. I'm gonna disagree with the majority and say that Tropic Thunder had a couple of chuckles, but was overall a rather dull comedy and a not very funny action film. I felt that the actors were mugging for the camera and the cheap shots at Hollywood were so far removed from reality that most of the satire fell flat.The characters weren't that bad but really not that great either. Consider the Robert Downey Jr character. Downey did as good a job as anyone could in that role, but the role itself was not funny past the first second we see him. It was basically the same joke told throughout the film and it was only slightly amusing the first time. I'm not sure if African Americans were offended by the role, but I wouldn't be surprised because the character is not making any satirical comment that relates to anything in reality. Its just a white guy acting like a black guy. And he did it pretty wrong. Honestly they should have either gotten a black actor for that role or just make Downey Jr. without the makeup (not looking like a black male). The treatment of retarded people was also offensive, in my opinion, as was the treatment of Vietnamese people. And the ending was very predictable and not funny. As a rewatch 04.27.17' this film is not as bad as initially thought as for the comedy is mostly hit or miss. It is well with the chemistry of the lead characters, and the fake trailers and stories the film makes ensuring given the leads a backstory is well done. The supporting characters work well, with some of them stealing their scenes (Danny McBride, Nick Nolte, and especially Tom Cruise portraying his disguising character).

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fresh, funny and doesn't pretend to be something it's not
","Scott Pilgrim vs the world has a fairly simple straight forward plot to follow. Its basically the same romance story we've seen before where boy meets girl, girl leaves boy, boy wants to get her back. But in Scott Pilgrim the film focuses much more on romance and that's what makes the film pretty good. There many nice fight scenes (esp. the ones at the end), and some good comedy. It was entertaining to watch because of its video-game, comic book style. Movies that are based on graphic novels, usually don't tend to be as great as the novels, and many times end up being different which causes many of the fans from the novels to feel cheated by the film. One thing I disliked was the continuity of gay jokes, and gay themes. It got tiring and annoying after a while.However, Scott Pilgrim vs. the world is an exception. Having read a few of the novels, I can say that the film follows the comic book style great and is a great adaptation. The film is original, fresh, flashy and doesn't try being something its not. Many complains are that the film is too cheesy and hipster, but that's how the comics are. The film was also pretty funny- the dialogue was great too. In my opinion, the film starts off good, then drags a little towards the middle, then comes back strong towards the ending. This film is definitely not for everyone. Many may feel it as cheesy, and weird, but at the same time their will be a lot of fans. As a rewatch 05/21/17', the film feels more so dragged down and cheesy but in ways that is more so the appeal.",8,0,3,3 December 2010
Die Hard 2," A Solid follow up
","Released 2 years after Die Hard, had seen a lot of high expectations considering the success and praise of Die Hard. With more pressure upon the film crew and cast in making Die Hard 2 as good and successful as the original, much must have been considered.Die Hard 2 feels slightly more serious in tone than Die Hard, as it is less campy, and Bruce Willis plays his character arguably the same (in a good way). Though the pacing ins't as good, as some parts tend to drag on and become boring, but other than that, there is enough action, with a similar plot. Though the plot feels less realistic and more silly but overall slightly less joking around from the leads, and villainsOne thing which was an improvement are the villains in Die Hard 2. With less cringe lines and a more serious tone, these terrorists worked better than the original.Although Die Hard 2 is lesser than the original, simply because the formula is rehashed (very similar opening and ending finale scenes) it is still quite a fun ride. We can see as to why these films are as loved, both have happy and predictable endings. After a rewatch 08/09/19' Die Hard 2 remains decent but a lesser version of the original. Not that great either, there are upsides but overall on a second watch, was more so bored. Enjoyed Die Hard with a vengeance more than Die Hard 2.",7,1,1,20 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," End of an era masterpiece
","In arguably the most anticipated movie of the year and one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Avengers: Endgame was well on its way with all the hype leading up to the film. Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment.",10,128,241,28 April 2019
No Country for Old Men," Suspenseful and Gripping
","No Country for Old Men has been widely praised by critics and considered one of the greater films of its release year as well as of the decade. This film may be classified as a perfectly realized modern day western thriller which combines moments of hard-edged violence, several sequences of suspense, frequent interjections of deliciously dry and laconic humor, and flashes of how not only the world has changed but the way our perspectives do as we get older. Much of the suspense comes from the cjaracter of Javier Bardem, as he steals his scenes. Josh Brolin is one of his earlier star turning roles, delivers a masterful performance. With these performances, is the main reason as to why this film is as great, as well as the directing and overall visuals of the scenery. The violence stands out in the film as graphic and it works in its favor. Overall, No Country is a well made drama, though a film not for everyone.",9,3,5,2 March 2018
The Love Guru," Mike Myers hits a new low!
","The Love Guru is another stupid comedy written from Mike Myers. Although billed as a comedy, The Love Guru is more like a snuff movie as we watch Mike Myers, of Austin Powers fame, slowly but emphatically kill his career during 80 laugh-free minutes. This film is filled with so many braindead jokes it just becomes very tiresome and annoying. Not to mention a lot of sexual and penis jokes, and many continuity jokes such as spelling words into acronyms, Guru adding 'TM' at the end of an acronym, annoying NHL commentators, etc.The Love Guru plot is basically about Guru Pikta (Myers) whom wants to surpass Deepak Chopra in celebrity, so he takes an offer from the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to get star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) back with his girl (Meagan Good), who has been swept away by rival Jacques 'Le Coq' Grande (Justin Timberlake) of the Los Angeles Kings. That seems pretty stupid and unrealistic even for a comedy.One thing that was okay was Mike Myers performances. It seemed tat he tried and it was pretty entertaining. Though the supporting cast was pretty boring and dull. In general the Love Guru insultingly stupid, filled with embarrassingly bad jokes. The occasional guest star appearances is amusing, but the movie is just dreadful and badly written.",2,2,5,29 September 2010
District 9," More dimensional and suspenseful than given
","District 9 plays out like a different take on suspenseful sci-fi films, but given a serious shot of originality by Blomkamp, whose techniques in particular provide a sense of gritty, grubby realism. Certainly, there's allegorical commentary on apartheid in particular, and segregation and racism in general, but as the film progresses it drifts into more straightforward action movie territory, and culminates with a huge shoot-out.However having passing through several times, there are echoes of what Blomkamp might have done with a Halo movie here as alien weapons spit plasma, exo-armour blasts its way through massed foes, and drop-ships take to the skies. It's pretty cool, actually. But alongside the wham- bang, Blomkamp doesn't lose sight of a human, or human-prawn, story as the Wikus, affectingly played by Copley, undergoes a transformation, and forms an emotive bond with Christopher. As a rewatch 03/18/20' and four years after the initial viewing, much memory of the film was forgotten but remembered that District 9 was a great watch. Having paying closer attention to detail on this rewatch, and possibly discovering more details than had not previously noticed, this film is quite a rare sci-if film and a masterpiece. Having enjoyed it better in its second viewing.",9,0,1,10 January 2016
Batman Begins," The start of a franchise
","Batman Begins opens with Bruce (Christian Bale) in a jail. We then learn through flashbacks that he has dropped out of Princeton seeking the means to fight injustice, on a sort of extended gap year. He's having a pretty miserable time, being continually challenged by the other inmates, but he's learned to hold his own with some pretty rough street-fighting skills. He meets a mysterious stranger (Liam Neeson) who offers to show him what he wants to know, and travels to the academy of a mysterious ninja-style academy where he is trained in the way of the warrior. On graduating, he discovers that the leader of the group, Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe), is less about justice than he is for killing, and Bruce cannot shake off his innate decency and compassion.Several moments later, Bruce returns to a decaying Gotham where, since the Depression of his childhood, things have gone from bad to worse, the criminals, led by Carmine Falconi (Tom Wilkinson) and his pet psychologist, Dr Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), run the city, the police force is utterly corrupt, and the good people do nothing. Handily, Bruce still owns a large share of Wayne Enterprises, which happens to have a really useful science department, run by the disaffected Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Formerly a member of the board, Fox is happy to help Bruce in every way he can. With the help of his loyal butler, Alfred (Caine), and Fox's gadgets, Bruce creates Batman, and begins to fight back. Throughout we then meet more characters and the film begins more as a drama with less action, though it does work in well favors. As a rewatch 03/17/20' Batman Begins remains an entertaining and thoughtful start to the Christopher Nolan Batman films.",9,0,1,3 February 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," Positive and Inspirational
","Based on a worldwide best selling novel, the Fault in Out Stars made a severe impact with audiences and helped elevate Shailene Woodley's career to the next level. Fans of the novel having many doubts as to how the film would compare and share with the novel. Compared to 'the Notebook', this film is quite arguably better and features arguably better writing and refreshing performances from its leads Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort showing great chemistry.A major reason why this film is as praise is due to the positive message, sensitivity of the issues and characters and the authentic feel of the film. In many romance drama teen films, there are silly and over the top forced comedy and they come off as cheesy. This film although deals with a serious matter, plays out in a relatively lighter tone and it works. Featuring likable characters, a clean and good pace, the Fault in Our Stars is quite an interesting tale and better than one expected.",8,0,1,27 July 2017
Bridesmaids," Not as good as the reviews say
","Bridesmaids. The cast go for broke in their effort to breathe life into the weak material, and for the most part come off badly. Wiig is trying to be a wild-eyed Lucy Ricardo type, and grows increasingly annoying as the plot proceeds; but then she has nothing to blame but her own script. Byrne is appropriately uptight and rigid, and manages to suggest the vein of vulnerability in Helen that's ultimately supposed to make her less than obnoxious, but again the screenplay doesn't offer her much to latch onto. Under Paul Feig's typically unsubtle direction McCarthy comes on big and brassy, and would have benefited from some greater distancing to make her less overbearingly; by contrast Rudolph makes virtually no impression. Worst used of all are Hamm, who adopts a smarmy smugness that reduces him to a Hank Azaria type, and the late Jill Clayburgh as Annie's oddball mother. Like Apatow's other output, 'Bridesmaids' is nicely mounted, with Robert D. Yeoman providing crisp cinematography and editors William Kerr and Michael L. Sale doing their best to smooth over the episodic feel and keep up the energy level. It's hardly their fault they don't entirely succeed.Weddings are trying experiences as a rule, and so is 'Bridesmaids.' The attempt to apply the male slob template to female characters is dispiriting, and it's more depressing to think it will probably be a great success.",1,1,6,19 December 2012
Meet the Fockers," Sequel Provides Decent Laughs
","After rewatching Meet the Fockers several years after its original release and my prior first time viewing, my initial thoughs about the film have changed since upon then. After the success of Meet the Parents (2000), the sequel Meet the Fockers was anticipated to be big and great. It wasn't great, yet good with several decent moments and some interesting premise. The plot was typically the same, expect both families meet each other, and they have problems with each other. Their families are complete opposites and don't interact well while being around one another. The movie started real slow, it got slightly better towards the end when the secrets got revealed but even that wasn't all that great. Some of the sexual things they thought were jokes. In particular, such as DeNiro wearing a breast pad on his chest, the same circle of trust, the dog humping, the constant use of the word 'Focker' (especially by DeNiro), the sexual convos at their dinner the baby signals, etc. All those things which the directors assumed was funny, really wasn't. First the baby was a distraction and most of his scenes felt distasteful. Though one continuous running subplot was DeNiro making accusations that Greg had a 15 son by his affair with his old-time Latina maid. There were many great moments, however what made the film a success is the overall chemistry between the cast, specifically the tension between the Focker family, and DeNiro. Overall this movie was a disaster and the actors should be ashamed of themselves big-time. It was a complete disappointment.",6,0,1,28 August 2010
Non-Stop," Solid Action Thriller
","Non-stop opens with the slow-motion slosh of Bill's whiskey bottle. Eyes bleary and bloodshot, he touches a snapshot of a young girl, then gruffly makes his way through security to the terminal. As passengers for the New York-to-London flight wait to board, he watches them with the suspicion required for the job, but also with the cynicism of a miserable man surrounded by people happier than him. Bill makes vague small talk with his neighbor, Jen (Julianne Moore), and the only thing either reveals is they both fly often. As he white-knuckles through takeoff, he explains to her, 'Some things, you never get used to.'Once the plane reaches cruising altitude, Bill receives anonymous text messages, which Collet-Serra visualizes as floating bubbles, like comic- book word balloons (unintentional foreshadowing for the silly finale, perhaps). The texter makes the standard demands: $150 million, or someone dies every 20 minutes. When Bill's supervisors on the ground learn the account for the ransom bears his name, his character and motives are called into question, although the audience will stand steadfast alongside him, for the most part.",7,0,1,22 January 2015

From there Frank's precisely ordered life starts to fragment as he's forced to face off against the french mob, Chinese gangsters and the police.

This is his home, the only place he's alive and himself. He has an upstairs apartment and a beat-up car and an Olympic gold medal that he puts around his neck before he speaks to bored kids at a school assembly, but his life is in the wrestling room and nowhere else.Suddenly when Schultz gets a mysterious invitation to meet a rich man at a country estate.

28 Days Later...," Mildly entertaining but overhyped
","Zombie movies are a rare type of genre within movies and many of them are similar but certain of them have something which distinguishes itself from the rest. 28 days later is a target British film and at times the accents can take away from the joy and become distracting.Solid characters to root for and the film is mildly entertaining but as a whole, does think isn't as great as it's been received. It is far tamer in terms of violence and horror jump scares than expected. This is a very mild horror film and most of it isn't scary. It is more of a virus based drama than a zombie movie. Though the buildup and explanation of the virus was well done. It does keep it intriguing.The ending is somewhat different as we see the lead protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) turn into an action hero- where he didn't show any tendencies of such prior. Also there is a supermarket scene which feels out of place, but perhaps was added to lighten the mood.The film is mostly predictable as we know the main characters are going to survive but along the way we do see things come in their way.",6,0,1,20 February 2020
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Mislead
","The trailers for Rise of the Planet of the Apes made audiences believe the film was more so an action film with a slight developmental story, but what we saw was more of a character study sap story of the history of apes. Personally I did not find the story too interesting as I think it could have been much better. We were shown to more drama and depressing moments than I had thought. Having not seen the originals, perhaps my expectations were slightly off. James Franco character is dull with not much emotion which did not make the audience not seem to care. Although he does well in some scenes (most specifically the scenes where he sees his ape for the first time coming to rescue him). It was also quite silly with folded CGI. Perhaps another viewing of this film might change my mind.",4,0,5,3 November 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," A lot happening
","Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised. Perhaps a second viewing is needed down the line.",7,3,4,12 March 2019
Gone Girl," Brilliant Over the Top Thriller
","Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) comes home one morning to find that his wife, Amy (Rosamund Pike) has gone missing, amid signs of a struggle. Scenes of the case, and Nick, being investigated, are interspersed with Amy's diary entries, which cover the early, happier days of their relationship, and the darker ones after the recession hit and things took a turn for the worse. While the movie sets itself up for a modicum of ambiguity, it's actually relatively straightforward once it starts playing its hand. Gone Girl was a novel of two voices; here it's a piece of one set of actions and one of narrations, a different representation of each half of the relationship. If Nick and Amy are dysfunctional at best, Fincher and Flynn are the actual dynamic duo that make Gone Girl work, having made careful decisions as to what to reveal at any given time.",9,1,3,16 August 2015
Get Out," Clever social thriller
","Get out has been heavily praised from both critics and audiences since its release in 2017. Described by some as horror film, it isn't quite as such but so more a social thriller. After having watching, concludes that the film does live up to the hype as the film's tone is great from the beginning and there is enough interesting material which makes Get Out highly intriguing and entertaining.The twist with the girlfriend being in in the scheme to take hostage of the lead was somewhat predictable, but the further twist in the very end was clever. What also makes the film better is the stand out performance from Daniel Kayuula as he takes an innocent character and is likable and easy to root for.",8,1,6,8 May 2019
Drive," Really well done with a unique style
","Finally got the chance to see this film after hearing a lot of praise about it, so I decided to watched it, and I think it lives up to it's hype. It is quite hard for me to review this movie. Everything that can be said HAS been said. Why would you even need another opinion? Drive has suspense, romance, great dialogue, and more that will just take up WAY too much time to put into full detail. Even though this movie is very meditative in nature, there are some really cool action scenes. The opening getaway scene may be slow, but has so much suspense in it as The Driver, whose name is never revealed, is a wheelman with a 5 minute window. He starts the clock, listens to the Police radio, and waits for the criminals he is driving for to be done with their heist. One of them gets back while the other is still in the building. This scene causes a ton of suspense. Will he just drive off and have the mission go off? Will the cops arrive? There is also an amazing car chase scene after a critical event in the movie which I thought was awesome.Like the protagonist, the film's actions speak louder than words. There is dialogue, but what is really memorable is the atmosphere, however, the dialogue is also brutally realistic even though I did think it was a bit odd how The Driver and Irene, the love interest, have huge pauses when talking, but that just adds to the mood of their relationship. I think the director described this movie as being Romeo and Juliet in a modern day setting which is true to some part. Even though The Driver is the bad guy and never talks that much, something heart wrenching comes when you see him get sad or get hurt.Drive is a great movie that has care for what it wants to be and executes everything well. It isn't flawless. It does some things that bothered me. Sometimes I get the feeling that the film is just TRYING to be too artsy and I just can't stand it when films do that. The violin/opera music starts to kick in and everything goes in slow motion or super fast. I am probably false accusing the movie and I know a complaint like that is off so I wont look down upon the movie for something it never did wrong. I also have a problem that the movie is ultimately missing something. This movie is short and I believe had they at least showed some flashbacks to Driver's previous life, it would have been better. The thing is we don't really know much about him so it is kind of hard to understand him. It is a little over an hour and 30 minutes. Some more would have done this movie good and I thought a little more development in the villains would have been nice. The violence is a little brutal, as explained before there is a scene of a woman's head blasted off, a scene where Driver smashed a guys face down in the elevator, a fork to the eye scene, a few slitted wrists scenes, some stabbings. I think the director was going for shock value and it worked for me but in all honestly, I could have done without that type of violence. I also didn't really like the ending. Not sure but it seemed a little rushed. All in all, a great film but definitely not for everyone.",10,4,7,8 February 2012
Ghost Rider," Has its moments

X-Men: The Last Stand," A step back from its predecessors
","X-Men: The Last Stand is the third film of the X-Men series and has been routinely criticized and panned somewhat in comparison to the two previous X-Men films, and deservingly so. Having seen this film only once when it was released and having little memory of what occurred, a more in depth rewatch was in need. The film's tone was noticeable different, being more over the top, silly and more comedic in some one-liner dialogue and overall tone as it feels like it was more watered down for children. This is perhaps more due to a director change with Brett Ratner directing The Last Stand, in comparison to Bryan Singer directing the first two films. X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't fully live up to the hype for several reasons. The plot is less thickened and more messy and rushed as to where many characters don't feel as fully developed. A few too many subplots are brought in. Also the film went out and killed main characters (Cyclops- very beginning, Charles Xavier- midway, Jean Grey- ending) giving more screen time to some of the lesser uninteresting characters. Halle Berry as Storm feels miscast as her role is larger and the character is more annoying, whinny, grumpy and overall there to lead (which isn't a great thing). Anna Paquin is still there as her role is more reduced than the previous films where Ellen Page comes in and takes up some of her screen time, setting a somewhat love triangle between them and Shawn Ashmore. Mystique is also reduced as she is there briefly and made out to be a human, once injected with the 'cure'- which was a waste of her appearance. What worked in X2 isn't here for the Last Stand such as Nightcrawler who was great, where they replaced him with Beast (a large part of the film) and Angel (Ben Foster).The action is still there but the film isn't as clever and interesting and entertaining. The end finale scene with Magneto and his crew coming together battling the other mutants by the Golden Gate was well done as the action there was fulfilled. There are still some moments of entertainment and the special effects and visuals are very nice (which was one of the main highlights). Though in comparison to X- Men (2000) and X2, The Last Stand as a film is a disappointment and let down, as one can see after watching the film directly after the previous two films,.",4,0,1,6 December 2017
Good Will Hunting," One of a kind original story
","Good Will Hunting takes place in Boston, which is where actor Matt Damon and Ben Affleck grew up together. It's not the Boston most people are familiar with, the Boston Common, the Charles River and the famous attractions. Instead, much of action takes place in the grittiness of Southie, or South Boston, shrouded in lower middle class desperation. Starring into the film, key and title character Will Hunting (Matt Damon) works as a janitor at MIT. He is in trouble with the law, getting into street and bar brawls. One day at work, he solves a complex mathematical problem left on a blackboard. A professor discovers his incredible intellect and rescues him from a jail stint for assault. In return for his probation, he must get counseling. After some funny scenes where he disposes of some psychiatrists by psychoanalyzing them, he finally meets his match in Sean McGuire (Robin Williams), a psychiatrist who grew up in his old neighborhood. McGuire is just as tough as Hunting and is smart enough to see through his defenses.Later into the film, Will Hunting also meets and falls in love with Skylar (Minnie Driver). Gradually McGuire and Skylar begin to lower Hunting's defenses until a crisis of courage is reached. In the process of healing Hunting, McGuire is also healed. McGuire has to reveal much of himself to Hunting in order to get his trust.Written by Damon and Affleck, the screenplay is shown to be very smart, funny and emotionally moving. All of the performances are powerful. Good Will Hunting is almost 20 years old, though it still has a feel that is fresh to first time viewers.",10,1,3,3 July 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Visually Stunning But Lacking in Story
","The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) tells the story of a man on his quest to travel around the world for work duties. But mysteriously the photo is misplaced, leading Walter on a global quest to retrieve it from the enigmatic photographer (Sean Penn). The resulting journey of self- discovery is both physical and psychological as work becomes secondary to personal fulfillment. The film is uneven and episodic by nature, with some awkward transitions between fantasy and reality, showcasing everything from broad comedy to effects-driven action sequences to lighthearted romance involving a sympathetic co-worker (Kristen Wiig). That playfulness is a better fit for Stiller's versatility than the flimsy mystery and the soul-searching voyage that bogs down the second half of the film. Those not willing to completely buy into its concept will find the story logic fundamentally flawed.",6,2,3,30 January 2015

The Incredibles is definitely one of the most stunning animated movies I have ever seen. I was amazed of how the plot all made sense and fit in perfectly. Moreover, it is a wonderful movie with really cool scenes and characters with a big heart. The music is stunning and the voice overs of all those great actors like Samuel L. Jackson (a.k.a.

I Am Legend," Great performance by Will Smith leads
","I Am Legend is considered a very solid book adaptation film and a well level given performance from Will Smith. This is the type of film which showed Will Smith's box office and superstardom as the film was a one-man show and a huge box office success, making $585 million worldwide. The film starts off interesting as we see what occurred in the near future in a post apocalypse world. With little dialogue, and great visuals of New York City, the film has an an inetresting and engaging tone. The second half of latter part of the film when the woman arrives, starts to trend downhill. The film is decent but feels as if it could have answered a few more unsolved questions, as it does feel relatively short. There were rumors of a sequel (or prequel) considering its box office but as of now over a decade since it's time, we know the answer.",6,1,1,12 April 2018

The Bourne Legacy," Not like the Original Bourne but not bad either
","The Bourne Legacy, then, is loads of fun in an efficient, straightforward way to which this franchise is not accustomed. (Some will take the reduction in convoluted spy-thriller antics as a sign of a dumbing-down, which might be true, but if so let's just say the sequel works on its own dumbed-down terms.) It's also, a little sadly, an illustration of the value of Matt Damon. Renner's a decent actor who does what's required of him here, but he doesn't have Damon's extraordinary mix of credibility and unshowy charisma. Picking up the slack a little is Edward Norton, who goes well beyond the call of duty to add nuance and human detail to a completely thankless role. His performance is emblematic of the approach here: apply uncommon craft and intelligence to a simple, crassly commercial conceit. The Bourne Legacy is worth your time to a surprising degree.",6,0,2,9 July 2013

The two are having so much fun, all audience members can do is buckle themselves in and enjoy the ride. The scenes in which the buddies discuss their relationship are particularly priceless.Throughout and for the most part. Screenwriters Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman alternate quick hits of broad physical comedy and clever repartee, resulting in rat-a-tat comic gems scattered throughout.

Kick-Ass," Surprisingly a really great movie
","I got the chance to see this movie last night (07/01/10') on DVD and it was great. I heard many great reviews and some mixed reviews but its a great movie. People need to stop talking movies too seriously and enjoy it for what it is. Granted, its not a movie for everyone, and not everyone would like it but people need to give it a try and quit at it if they dislike it.It's rare when a movie is seemed better than the trailer and this movie is just one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people's opinion, on how this isn't a plausible superhero movie, and more of a wannabe superhero's fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero movies. This movie was ballsy and yet very entertaining to watch because unlike PG-13 movies, this movie goes all out. They don't hold back on the action and violence, and that is one of the reasons why this movie was successful. I am glad the distributors decided not to dumb this movie down for the younger audiences. Nicolas Cage did a great job with his role as well but unlucky for him, he character dies towards the end. His daughter, Hit-Girl really stole the show in this movie and she was definitely the main character towards the end of the movie. It was intense and amazing!",10,3,9,2 July 2010
Unknown," Confused thriller
","Liam Neeson has seemingly over taken his career since his turn in start hit Taken. As more of an action hero, we see him in Unknown. This film does offer some engaging ideas and is quite intriguing, then at the same time is quite confusing and feels that it did not live up to its hype. Massed with a lot of positive audience reviews, and praising Liam for his role, well into the film he isn't the problem.Overall, Unknown is quite decent but one expected better and a better ending and overall twist, given the constant praise the film had received. Several 'plotholes'seem to be within the film's story. As a film titled 'Unknown' it is not as memorable, though still thought provoking in the least. Perhaps another viewing with more clarification will ensure the film better.",5,1,4,10 February 2019
The Hurt Locker," Visually Stunning War film
","The Hurt Locker is one of the more critically praised war-based films of all time. Having winning best picture Oscar, the hype was heavily surrounded. For most critics it was well loved, but for several film goers they did not like the film as winning best picture.The Hurt Locker does deliver in terms of its technical aspects and overall directing, cinematography and visuals. It is very well shot, and well edited. And the characters and performances from leads Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie are star making and they instantly elevate the film. One can see some of the criticism some people say about the film that it isn't that action packed and suspenseful. And I can agree, most of the film is of the three crew members in Iraq protecting the area, diffusing bombs and overall protecting themselves from the locals. I did not find it as suspenseful or gripping as it has been described but still an entertaining watch-mainly for the performance of Jeremy Renner. Although quite predictable, though this is a film that seems to require more than one watch.",7,0,0,21 July 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Somewhat bland and not as Interesting as its Predecessors
","X-Men: Apocalypse was one of the bigger blockbusters of last summer year. As many have noticed and withdrawn, the 3rd installment of this X-Men franchise. And this is arguably in retrospect the worst of the franchise. Without the presence of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), this film was both a box office disappointment and received its worst reviews out of the three X-Men films. One reason as to why this film isn't as good, is that the storyline is loaded with too many characters. The acting and characters are well portrayed as the actors are a good representation of the characters but they're are a few too many and scenes seem to split and go back and forth. As well as the main villain and title character: Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), the ancient Egyptian mutant god who has been resurrected in 1983. The villain isn't that well known and this character is not that interesting. His powers were far too simple and it felt as if it was cheating. There are some brief bits of action and some decent quality storyline, but as a whole this film is a disappointment compared to Days of Future Past and First Class. Also filled a predictable ending, the audience is left wondering that this really was it. ==================================================================== = ======= As for a rewatch 07/07/17' X-Men: Apocalypse remains the worst X-Men film of the new franchise, though it still does offer some decent scenes. Opinions remain same though one is more likened to the film after paying closer attention and on another viewing. It does not have the same spark and interest as Days of Future Past.",6,0,2,4 March 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Underdeveloped Let Down of a Sequel
","The followup sequel to the 2012 reboot The Amazing Spider-Man, director Marc Webb returns to bring this sequel. Now having watched the film in its full entirety, I have noticed more than its share of pieces than I have originally. TASM2 is precisely nowhere near as complete and story oriented than its processor, and there are several reasons for these claims. In TASM2 the tension and characters between the leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are there, but there was too much of it. The romance worked in the first one but in here, it should have been toned down. The lead villain of Electro (Jamie Foxx) I believe was a terrible choice as a villain and actor. The presence was not felt, and Electro being the lead villain did not do justice. There was little excitement. I did enjoy Dane Dehaan as Harry Osbourne, the Green Goblin, but his character as the Green Goblin was underused (Green Goblin only shows up for one scene towards the final 30 minutes). The development was not much but the relationship scenes with Peter and Harry were solid.The overall tone of the film was much more depressing than the original. Mainly because of how the film ends with letting Gwen have an exit (we knew it was coming but I believe it could have done much more smoothly). Aside from that, the overall atmosphere just did not work and it was more dark and less to get into. The story was lacking, which is why I think TASM was much better, because it had a better story, more original and there was more heartfelt emotion left. Also there were more consistent action scenes where as in TASM2 it did feel more as a love story, which of course would be a letdown for Spider-Man fans. As of now it is undecided how TASM3 will be, or if there will be another reboot of the franchise. I hope the best decision will be made. ==================================================================== == ======
As a rewatch (07/10/17') we can see the flaws and overall tone which made this film be considered a mess for critics and movie goers resulting into the eventual reboot for Spider-Man: Homecoming. The main problems with the film as mentioned in the review are the plot isn't as interesting as they thought and has been done before and the character of Max/Electro was a very weak and awful choice for a villain. The character did a very quick turn into loving Spider-Man to wanting to kill him. It made little sense.Besides the nice visuals, and the costume of Spider-Man, much of this film was a disappointment. In the end, TASM2 may be the most forgettable Spider-Man live action film. After a third rewatch 04/03/19', TASM2 really does not offer much of anything interesting, and there are many flaws. Not enough interest to warrant a great watch.",3,2,20,6 January 2015
Ex Machina," One of a kind Sci-Fi
","Ex Machina the 2014 science-fiction film to have crossed through many minds for its input on the genre. It's rare for a sci-fi film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance—but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor. Because whatever writer/director Alex Garland wants to say about the nature of what it means to be alive, or the very human qualities of deception and self-deception, and I'm not sure he's really saying all that much. Is not remotely as delightful as watching one of the most talented actors in the world doing his thing.Ex Machina's premise is built around the reason Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) has won an opportunity to spend a week with Nathan: Nathan needs assistance with a very special experiment. He has developed an artificial intelligence robot in female form called Ava (Alicia Vikander), but the question of whether Ava is truly sentient requires the Turing test. It's Caleb's job to spend time with Ava— her translucent limbs, skull and torso exposing the sparkling machinery beneath the surface, so as to provide a constant reminder of her synthetic nature—and ask the right questions to figure out what's going on in her man-made brain. On all fronts, the film delivers great performances, wonderful technology and is visually stunning to watch. Gleeson is the weakest link of the film and I believe to be miscast but besides his performance, Vikander and Isaac carry the film. Ex Machina isn't predictable like many films in recent memory and it keeps audiences guessing.==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch (08/18/17') Ex-Machine is one of the better sci-fi films of the decade. Watching for a second time, one is able to notice more subtle clues and hints of the film as to where we think it may be heading. Ex-Machine is the type of film which Hollywood and major studios should be making more of, as it is a rare breed of great intellect.",10,2,6,18 January 2016
The Illusionist," Not very Entertaining
","Having put off the Illusionist for some time, I am only now viewing it. Having seen the high ratings for the film, my expectations were high. While watching the film, I was at times very bored and was not near to caring for many of the characters. I can see why people enjoy the film, it seems well directed and acted, and the cinematography is wonderful. Overall it did not provide much entertainment and excitement.The plot and pace are what killed the movie for me. In the first half it's fine, and necessary to really develop your characters and get the audience to invest in them. But by the time the murder occurs, the pacing hasn't changed at all. We know Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), though ordered to shut Norton down, is a good guy that wants to do the right thing; we know that Eisenheim (Ed Norton) is talented and ballsy; we know that they are in love; but at the point the film should kick things up a notch. Instead, the audience is treated to a full forty-five minutes of an excruciatingly slow re-hashing of these character and plot points.The chemistry between Norton and Biel isn't present enough to build up a relationship worth investing in. Individually the performances are all fine, but the passion that connects them just isn't there. It's the kind of thing that can make or break a film like The Illusionist, and in this case the film comes off so disconnected and flat that I just wasn't hypnotized by the film's plot. I saw the film's magic, but alas I did not feel it. However the film does have some good performances (kudos to Norton for playing mysterious very well) and the sets and costumes. The film also manages to put together a pretty decent surprise ending, but looking back on it now it's seems so obvious, I actually feel rather stupid for actually falling for it.",3,0,2,14 August 2014
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," real good, better than the first
","Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is a really cool and fun movie to watch. IMO, its better than the first. I enjoyed FF a lot but i think this one tops it. The characters blend much better with each other and there is more detail. Its doesn't seem as funny but id say there's more action than in FF. The negative about this movie is that should have put more fight scenes.The beginning starts off kinda slow but than the movie picks up the pace and gets better. The movie gets much better when the Silver Surfer spots Susan in the desert and they start talking. After that, the movie seems much more fun and gets to the point better and easier. I love the final battle between the fantastic 4 and Victor, that was sweet when Johnny combined all the rest of the members powers with his so he can have all their powers. The very ending where Reed and Sue get married in Asian is pretty much how the movie begins but anyways it takes off from there. I also like how Johnny and Ben got along more but i was cheesed because Ben's 'blind black bit**' is back. I also hated that army guy (forgot his name). He was so annoying and ruined the movie. While watching the film, you can tell that there is gonna be a third installment. I cant wait for to come out, its gonna be dope.Anyways, id recommend this movie, its real good, many of the negative comments are bs and are lies..this series is very underrated IMO.As a rewatch 08/14/19' and after rewatching the original Fantastic Four (2005) for the first time in a long while, opinions upon both films are slightly altered. This sequel is better than the original and is enjoyable for what it is, but as a whole, there could have been more done to make this film better. None the less, don't think too hard and take this movie too serious.",8,3,4,15 January 2009
Transformers," Great visuals and great story altogether
","Transformers is simply amazing. It is entertaining, fun, and the special effects are mind-blowing, even for this age when people take them for granted in every movie.Of course, all the critics would find many reasons why this film would be bad. They always do that. Regardless, people like it, and that is the main thing. Unlike some other animation/comics-based films, Transformers actually leave the old shell behind and focuses more on making a good entertainment rather than satisfying the die-hard fan's desires for boxy, classic characters. The pacing and editing is also unusual for this kind of movies, resulting in a very realistic environment.Shia LaBoeuf is simply great as the main character, and stands out the most, whilst Megan Fox, playing the role of protagonist's dream girl, is only trying to look hot instead of acting, sometimes making me wonder if anybody would notice the difference if a poster would be put in her place with voice-over. Her lines are pathetic, but a good (or any) actor talent should have dealt with that. She just doesn't have it.Overall, a great entertainment. I was very satisfied. This wouldn't have worked without Michael Bay, which made the movie into something more than one would expect from just hearing the name. 9.5/10==================================================================== ==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch 08/07/17' of revisiting this first Transformers after watching Age of Extinction, this film stacks up and looks a lot better in comparison. Overall, this film isn't technical on a story and plot scale but it does entertain, and the run time doesn't feel as overly long since it is an enjoyment. Rated a 9 in comparison to the other Transformers film as one feels this is the clear cut best film of the franchise. It is a shame how far the franchise has came since this film 10 years ago. Where as now that the Transformers franchise has had 5 films, many people today are revisiting this film and tending to like it more due to nostalgia and the current state of the series with Mark Wahlberg. Where as back when this was released, it received a lot of backlash from critics and some fans but now it is considered 'great/enjoyable' and people are missing Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox.",9,5,8,8 August 2010
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Great visuals but lacking in story
","Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is an animated comedy. This movie was pretty boring and plain ridiculous (even for an animated film). I know its a kid movie but the plot was so weird and not realistic. Because most of the time, they are missing the heart and inspiration that Pixar has. Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is one of those animated films. It's missing the heart and there isn't much inspiration put into the film. Its pretty predictable and very easy to tell what will happen and how the film will end. This is the story of a scientist named Flint (Bill Hader). He is a likable character. The problem with his inventions are that none of them actually work. He also works at his dad's(James Caan) work. His inventions blow until he invents a machine that causes food to rain from the sky.Flint meets a newscaster(voiced by Anna Farris) who he soon falls for. The film is funny at sometimes but in general its really not. And the movie keeps your attention for the most part. But in the last half hour, the film gets awfully stupid. There is a scene in which Flint, Sam, the newscaster, and a retarded Sardine's representative (Andy Samburg)are going into a huge ball of food. Eventually, pizza slices try to blow them up. And once they get in the cave, these creepy looking turkeys come alive and try to kill them. That is how stupid the movie is.I thought the movie could have added more and could have used Mr. T's character and his son more. Some of the other characters were just boring and not that great. Don't let the critics and ratings fool you, this movie is not that great",3,7,15,12 August 2010
Children of Men," Lacking of real suspense and thrills
","Films set in the dystopian future are always visually stunning and offer some good ideas and insight of the future as the writers and director have comeup with. Children of Men, does contain a great cinematography and visuals and the overall idea and thought of the film is well. But overall this film lacks suspense, thrills and an excitement which one would have expected. Seeing very rave reviews and understanding how praised this film has been, the outcome of the film left one disappointed and confused as to why it has been as highly as praised. The ending of the film came at a surprise where it was a 'that's it?' ending. The film does pick up some pace but barely though overall the film isn't very thrilling.It is more basically a chase/escape film about a London worker (Clive Owen) who must protect and safe guard a London refugee to a safe place since she is the only woman pregnant in the last 18 years. We understand this but the character of the pregnant woman is rather unlikable as we wonder what's the point. When we look back on the film, not much of a story occurs as the film goes through it's typical plot points with an ending that is rather unsatisfying and it simply 'just ends'A lot of unanswered questions are left in which one would have expected to been explored more. Questions such as {Spoilers}: Why can't women become pregnant anymore? (this was never mentioned?), How did the woman become pregnant? Was it a natural birth/any medications she was on? Who was the father? Why did Michael Caine's character sacrifice himself? What happened with the 'Human Project'? The overall poor treatment of the immigrants? What happens with Clive Owen's character in the end? Overall, Children of Men is very disappointing film",3,3,8,15 July 2017
Dumb and Dumber," Entertaining but over-hyped
","Dumb and Dumber has been highly praised and loved throughout since its release in 1994. Having over twenty years later, the long awaited sequel was delivered. This film has been considered by many to be hilarious, and one of the funnies 'silly' comedies of all time. Nothing much about the film is as funny as advertised, more so a bunch of silly and cringe gags and jokes which we are intended to laugh at. What works for the film is the characters and the chemistry of both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. We understand their characters are dumb and the situations they are put into are silly, they do carry the film but as a whole the jokes aren't funny. Dumb and Dumber is more so entertaining than it is funny, and many jokes try a little hard to be funny, which isn't great. Most of the jokes come from toilet humor and obvious predictable events, filling with a simple and predictable plot.",4,1,5,18 June 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Flaws but Decent on Action and Plot
","Guardians of the Galaxy starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill proves to be the ideal leading man, carrying the bulk of the film and making the cocky, self-centered Quill likable enough to garner our sympathies and get us to root for his redemption without dulling the guy's edge. Saldana is the perfect foil for him, cutting Quill down to size before falling for him. It's Diesel and Cooper who steal the majority of the spotlight, however; Rocket and Groot are fascinating and wonderfully realized creations, and the two actors do a superb job of acting through the CGI 'makeup' to make them stand out as flesh and blood people. Cooper's approach to the killer raccoon plumbs new levels of sarcasm. Bautista also surprises; Drax is written as an alien whose people take everything literally, setting up some choice gags that the former MMA fighter-turned- thespian delivers with perfect timing and the deadest of deadpan deliveries. In the end the film has been praised and the hype has matched the praise, however the film struggles mid way and becomes a decent action film. Perhaps a second and more viewing would be necessary.",7,2,3,16 August 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Stylish and high profile but a little over-hyped
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is considered by many to be a very violet film and is arguable considered by Quentin Tarantino to be his fourth film (previously stated within the film's opening credits). Tarantino makes it well known that this film is his as he does in all of his films, where he makes it known that he is more important himself than his actual films or the actors acting in his films. Obviously self-righteous but as a high level profile as himself, one is able to do that. Kill Bill's plot appears to be relatively plot-free. The film plays as one long homage to Asian martial arts films, and the plot serves only to provide excuses for the action set pieces, which are undeniably as they are horrific. The problem isn't the film is too violet is that the characters are not likable, and everything occurring is quite predictable. The action sequences are shot well, but the film tries hard being more than that. Within the story centers a character known as The Bride (Uma Thurman), who is working down her kill list in order to avenge the death of her unborn baby. The group she is fighting goes by the name of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The movie is broken up into chapters very similar throughout, using names such as 'The Blood Splattered Bride.' The highlight of the movie sees near towards the middle of the ending where it hyperboles within a long hyperviolent type anime episode in the middle but then ultimately picking back up when it switches back to live action as the bride single-highhandedly battles and defeats O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu) and her numerous warriors. These last few fight sequences involving the Bride defeating these ninja warriors is very unrealistic and hard to take serious, as she is one woman completely destroying and fighting off far many trained assassins. As a revenge movie, the film makes it hard for us to root for the Bride as she isn't a great character in any needs and very unlikable. Not too interesting either, perhaps considered by many to be miscast by Uma Thurman, and I am in agreement within this statement. Having been compared to the Matrix (1999), the Matrix is a far better film in about every area, though just not near as violet. Overall, Volume 1 is slightly overrated and over-hyped as a film but considering it is from Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino, this isn't surprising.",4,2,4,29 June 2017
From Dusk Till Dawn," Full of silliness and empty characters
","From Dust Till Dawn plot involves two psychopath brothers. The older professional bank robber and killer Seth Gecko (Clooney) and the younger perverted psychopath killer, Richie (Tarantino), who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist. They escape jail and go on a killing spree in Wichita and then flee to rob a liquor store in a small Texas border town. They have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops, they have also taken a middle-aged bank teller as a hostage. In the liquor store they kill a Texas Ranger and the store clerk, and burn down the store. Stopping off in a flop-house motel, Richie rapes and slaughters the hostage. These scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody, if that's possible. The story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet Carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the Titty Twister. The place is open from dawn to dusk, thus the film's title. Here's where Rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun, as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout. It sells sex to its patrons, and has exotic stripper Santanico Pandemonium (Hayek) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire. The brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place, as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the film's staple.",4,2,5,11 January 2016
Jerry Maguire," Romantic comedy disguised as a sports movie
","This movie seems to be a mix of many different genres (comedy, romance, drama, sports, money) and we can see as to why it is such loved. But as a film, it is actually quite pretentious, and overly long and sappy. The sports angle starts off as intriguing but once the romance and love story come in, it takes away from the excitement, and becomes a predictable rom-com.The performance from Tom Cruise is him playing his essential character, lovable guy but also a slick 'all about me' type. He's the lead and who we are supposed to root for. Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar for his role but was playing a more over the top athlete type, and came across as annoying- yet people love his character and performance for how 'authentic' it is. And Renee Zellweger is the love interest but happens to be a rather weak and uninteresting character. Also her son is one of the more annoying and corny characters in the film.People love this film for its famous catchphrases ('Show me the money!', 'You complete me', 'You had me at hello') and it has a nostalgic feel.It seems that Cameron Crowe desperately tried making a film to ponder to many different demographics, and seeing its box office resume and the fact it won or was nominated for several awards, he succeeded in that sense. But as an audience opinion, the film isn't serious enough to be a drama, not funny enough to work as a comedy, too womanly to be a sports movie, and too sporty for a Lifetime movie.Overall, Jerry Maguire is watchable and somewhat intriguing at times, but as a while is quite long and becomes a bore. It really is a romantic comedy disguised as a sports film. Not nearly as great as people clamor for it.",3,0,4,21 June 2019
Here Comes the Boom," Not very funny and Predictable
","Kevin James stars as Scott Voss, a high school biology teacher who's gradually lost his passion for education. But when budget cutbacks threaten to cancel the school's music program and lay off its teacher (Henry Winkler), Scott volunteers to raise money to save his job. Teaching night classes at the local community college doesn't pay nearly enough, however, so Scott enlists the help of one of his students to train him to become a mixed martial arts fighter after he learns you can make good money even by losing. Though the school principal believes that Scott is making an embarrassment of himself by getting beat up, he quickly earns the respect of his students and the faculty while unexpectedly rising within the MMA ranks. Here Comes the Boom doesn't provide many laughs and is too predictable for one's liking. The film extends and doesn't provide much twists, turns or anything much of greatness.",3,5,8,25 August 2016
Clash of the Titans," Much room for improvement
","Having not seen the original Clash of the Titans, I wasn't really expecting much from this Clash of the Titans. Though I still I had several low expectations before watching the film because of many negative comments I've read from critics and posters. I still was a little disappointed after watching this film, and many of the negative comments about the film were right. Though, some of the action sequences were pretty nice and exciting. But there really wasn't much action. Aside from that, the story was lacking and not that great. Also somewhat a little confusing to follow. The story didn't really stay true to Greek Mythology, and it should have been much better. The film wasn't as bad as many people have been describing it, but it was still pretty bad and disappointing. Hopefully the sequel will be much better. There's a lot of room for improvement and I think 'Wrath of the Titans' could be really good, if done well.",3,1,3,10 January 2011
Jurassic World," Don't understand the hype
","Having waited several years since this film was released to watch, and initially not being too interested in the film. Did not have high expectations. Also having not seen in the original Jurassic Park films, and not being a typical fan of dinosaur films in general.There are some decent pieces of entertainment to be held in this film but overall feels very watered down to attract a family friendly feel and audience.Not many thrills and, characters we do not really care for. Jurassic World currently has an IMDB rating of 7 and this film brought in over $1 billion dollars worldwide- of course ensuring a sequel. After watching this film, couldn't help by wonder what the hype is about. Enjoyable sure at times, but nothing too special or stood out.",5,0,0,14 January 2020
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," surprisingly fun and entertaining
","I enjoyed this movie, its very cool and not that predictable. Johnny Depp absolutely stepped up into this role. He's an amazing actor. He truly has become one - if not the - best actors of our time. All the children made the movie great with them being unique and creative. I liked the gum chewing girl and Charlie. The effects that they used to make the chocolate factory was incredible. The Oompa-Loompas looked so funny and their acting and dancing was hilarious. The director Tim Burton has great vision and the minor changes that he made from the original bring today's version easily into our homes. The only real weakness in this movie is that its kinda too dark and Charlie is very boring, he barely shows emotion, that messes it up. This movie can be boring sometimes and it feels a little weak, many people will enjoy this but others will hate it. Remember, this is just one guys opinion",7,0,1,8 November 2008
The Adjustment Bureau," Misleading trailers bring new opportunities
","The Adjustment Bureau is subject to the disruptive ripple effects when something goes wrong, as in the case of David Norris (Matt Damon), a good guy from the working class with the drive and the charisma to rise, per The Plan, to the White House. One the eve of his election to the Senate, though, a skeleton from his past emerges, quashing his otherwise all-but-certain victory. At his lowest point, with the election returns resoundingly against him, he meets Elise (Emily Blunt) under less that portentous circumstances. The audience sees as he is practicing his concession speech in the men's washroom, and she's hiding there after getting caught crashing a wedding. They have an immediate attraction, but more, they also have an intense emotional connection. Mr. Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) fails to make David spill his coffee at the appointed time. David catches the bus to his new job instead of missing it, runs into Elise, and gets her phone number. When he arrives at work it is to the disconcerting discovery that the office folk are frozen mid-motion, and, those corporate hat-wearing types are doing something odd to his new business partner. From there on, we are then met with a series of different effects surrounding fate and free will. As a rewatch 09/05/18 The Adjustment Bureau is quite decent enough but not as intriguing and engaging as thought to be.",6,0,0,14 October 2015

Their obstacles include aggressive enemy soldiers and legions of hostile civilians, plus what they see as inadequate support from US leaders.

The Hangover Part II," Not as good as the Original
","I was interested in seeing the Hangover Part II because I enjoyed the original Hangover and I read many more negative reviews. The Hangover Part II feels padded at 102 minutes. At the same time, it sticks so closely to the original's template that it could almost be deemed a remake rather than sequel.Add to that humor that never transcends the juvenile, and you have an annoying movie. Director Todd Philips and his writing team, Scot Armstrong and Craig Mazin, fill the film with penis jokes, Asian stereotypes, and pop culture references. Not much originality here, just more cruder and much less funny jokes.A movie like this needs as many solid one-liners as possible. The first part of the film goes to great pains to reintroduce the characters, still recovering from their Las Vegas misadventure in The Hangover. This much exposition seems like a waste of time for a comedy of this nature.It is also a mistake on the director's part to spend so much capital on reminding us of the first movie-when he is about to offer us up such a poor excuse for a sequel.Even when the guys finally get to Thailand for the main action, The Hangover Part II takes its pretty time picking up any steam. Their protracted search through Bangkok for a missing teenager who partied too hard with them on another lost night gets old fast.The characters themselves, which should be the film's strongest selling point, are not really happening either. Stu (Ed Helms), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) all feel undercooked now-less than one-dimensional. Philips often has the three screaming at one another as they trek through Bangkok. The chemistry among the three actors has gone flat, and their bickering starts to feel interminable.The new teen character, Teddy (Mason Lee), Stu's fiancée's little brother, could have been developed into a genuine addition but is basically discarded for most of the movie. The film ends on a decidedly sour note when the guys discover, as in the first movie, digital photos of the night they cannot remember.Overall, The Hangover Part II has a slapdash quality. The filmmakers probably should have taken more time to think things through. The movie even looks slapped together: the mise-en-scene is sloppy, the makeup is uneven, and there are continuity errors galore. The film takes itself too seriously and it works more as a drama with comedy/action elements than a straight up comedy.=== As a rewatch (03/06/18') The Hangover Part 2 is somewhat as remembered, it being a very similar copy to the original. From the opening scene and ending scene of part 2, is the same as we saw in part 1. What made the original great is tat it was believable and refreshing, as Part 2 is essentially the same thing, just set in a different location, with minor differences. There are some decent funny moments but nothing as funny and unpredictable as the original. Overall, it's a decent watch of entertainment but lack in the magic and suspense of the original. As a another rewatch 05/31/19' to and a day after rewatching the first Hangover to share the similarities and rehash the memories, it's clear again that this sequel isn't nearly as good and original as the first. There are enjoyable scenes since the crew are back together but overall, this isn't as funny, entertaining or thrilling.",5,0,1,6 July 2012
Prisoners," Brilliant Suspenseful Drama
","Prisoners explores the various talents and relies on its leads Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, and they deliver great performances in this suspenseful crime thriller. It's Thanksgiving in suburban Pennsylvania when two little girls go missing. Jackman is riveting as Keller Dover, a tightly wound, deeply religious, and apocalyptically inclined survivalist father of 6-year-old Anna. Bello, as his wife Grace, is less prone to the creeping, religiously tinged paranoia, but utterly believable in her shroud of shattered normalcy.Also missing is 7-year-old Joy, the daughter of next-door neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch (Howard and Davis). Gyllenhaal is the twitchy, blinking Detective Loki, who is called in to investigate, and Dano plays a mysterious RV-driving drifter who has mental health issues and is quickly nabbed as the obvious suspect. But, as in the aforementioned Zodiac (which also starred Gyllenhaal), few things are what they at first seem.Prisoners runs at 153 minutes but watching and paying close attention, the film does not feel nearly as long, and every minute within the second half is entertaining, and gripping. Much complaint at how the ending's last 20-30 minutes are but I am in agreement that it is not therefore predictable but a lasting touch. There are several clues that are shown before then, and it is a great watch to see the final end result.",9,0,1,4 January 2015
Logan," Succeeds and completes a great franchise
","Logan is the follow up to 2013's the Wolverine and the final film apart of the series. This film takes itself to new heights and is very much so better than the previous films of the series. Having not too high expectations but seeing constant praise and word of mouth surrounding this film, as it was being considered a 'classic' and 'one of the greatest superhero films', one was not too much to have expected, but overall Logan lives up to the hype and exceeded my expectations.Noticeably different in this film compared to previous films of the series and X-Men films, is the R-rating. This apparently gave the studios a higher risk as they went all out. Most notably because of the success of Deadpool, an R-rated Woverine probably would not have happened. But we are lucky as it did as this film completely fulfills with its R-rating. The violence is top notch, much more realistic and we see Hugh Jackman use stronger profanity (some were forced in the beginning but it fits). Logan really is brutal and overall violent which is what makes it work, we see a lot of strong violence where his claws are stabbing through peoples limbs, their eyes and face, heads being ripped apart and just overall strong much satisfying violence.The overall story line and plot is compelling and interesting in the least. the film's tone is very mature, serious and doesn't try for comedic relief or unnecessary punchlines, jokes or any silliness (like in the Last Stand). What makes this film work and succeed is not only the constant great chemistry between Logan and Charles, but the introduction to Laura- who very much so steals her scenes and is captivating to watch as the film goes. Logan has some very well done action sequences but with a running time of over 2 hours 17 mins, the story here is what keeps the film entertaining and on gas.This film is emotional at the right times, unpredictable and will have leaving with a sense of greatness, that if this is Hugh Jackman's final appearance as Wolverine, then it was well deserved. Though, one thing which could have been better slightly was the handling of Wolverine's death. We see the rare emotion from Laura but it felt very quick and not too satisfying. Overall, Logan succeeds as the best Wolverine film, one of the best X-Men films (along with Days of Future Past), and one of the best superhero comic book films in general.",10,2,5,9 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Downgrade from the original
","The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the highly expected sequel to the cultural impactful classic of 2012's The Avengers. within Age of Ultron, you can feel the burden of all this heavy lifting threatening to crush writer-director Joss Whedon, who, by comparison, had it easy the first time out, in The Avengers. His task this time: Show the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be working together as a team; drive a wedge between them through Stark's creation of a peacekeeping AI called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) that turns against them; develop a romance between Natasha and Banner; flesh out Hawkeye, the regular Joe and, to this point, the most under-developed member of the group; introduce new characters, such as the twins Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). This already can seem like a lot, where as the plot is somewhat sort of messy. It is still entertaining but when comparing Age of Ultron to the original, everything about the original has this film beat.Age of Ultron is a good watch but it's hard to ignore certain boring or forced scenes. As many have said, this film being disappointing only lifts up expectations for the next Avengers film in the franchise. And we all know, the hype level and expectations for the third film will be quite high.
=====
As a rewatch (05/05/18') Age of Ultron is a decent watch but at time overwhelming and parts of certain boring. With many uninteresting subplots, action is there but some parts remain not as great. Opinions and voting remain same after a year of second viwing.",6,1,3,15 February 2017
Hotel Transylvania," Average predictable animation
","Hotel Transylvania is quite a standard and average animation film. With a very typical and predictable plot outline which has been done before. Ex: An over protective father is worried about his teenage daughter growing up, she falls for a boy- father doesn't like the boy at first than eventually bonds with him and settles that his daughter is okay being with him. The only difference that separates this typical plot is that they are monsters (Draculas).The animation is decent, some interesting characters but the comedy isn't anything special. A few laughs (more so chuckles) but nothing that really stood out. Somewhat surprised how this film has spawned two more sequels.",5,0,1,2 August 2019
The Dark Knight," Increase lived hype and expectations succeed
","Director Christopher Nolan's original film in the franchise Batman Begins (2005) swooped upon its bat-film predecessors and their signature elements, all in one which was a great way to start a successful franchise. However, the gripping, enthralling entertainment that is The Dark Knight, wires the whole lot with explosives, presses the detonator, then runs over the remains with the monster-truck tires of a supersouped bat bike. Oh, and hey: get a load of the new clown in town.The Dark Knight combines and elevates itself in this film over the original. It's part two in Nolan's visionary, pitch-black re- imagining of the comic-book–based series about the Batman and his billionaire alter ego, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale). This film has been heavily praised throughout the years for it's realism and it's great action sequences, along of course with the Joker performance of Heath Ledger. Overall, the Dark Knight is a rare comic book film which has potentially succeeded expectations and is require for multiple viewings.",10,0,2,4 February 2017
Everest," Based on true events but flawed
","Everest tells the story that was based upon true events in which happened in 1996 when a group of mountain climbers decided to climb Mount Everest. Everest is worth watching and the actors portrayed by the real people are accurate in description as well as the other details. Overall, the story is interesting though at times, the film becomes dragged on and some parts could have been more suspenseful and thrilling. The film is quite generic in style and none of the characters somewhat stand out, though it is expected.",6,1,2,24 February 2018
Friends with Benefits," Delivers on its premise
","Friends with Benefits which has been described as a romantic comedy with plenty of uninhibited scenes, explores the idea that affairs can be carried on satisfactorily without any complicating notions of love or commitment. Several to only four writers are credited in this film, including director Will Gluck, along with five producers, and they've come up with a storyline, a screenplay and some engaging performances from a first-rate ensemble cast. Friends with Benefits was released several months after No Strings Attached (starring Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman) which are of similar plots, however Friends with benefits did slightly better at the box office (worldwide), and received far better reviews from top critics. What makes the film good and enjoyable is the chemistry from its leads, otherwise the film would have been a predictable and typical romantic- comedy which we have seen many times before. As a rewach 08/09/18' Friends with Benefits remain an entertaining and highly watchable film. Strong message and tons of a laughs throughout.",7,0,1,25 August 2016
Into the Wild," Great Vision
","Into The Wild showcases in chronicling Christopher McCandless' willful transformation from moneyed college graduate to roaming vagabond on a penniless quest to Alaska, Penn turns Krakauer's exhaustive journalism into pure cinema. While the narrative is strong, it works in glorious harmony with Penn's free-form visual generosity. The first 20 minutes or so are filled with beautiful images of nature and there's sparse exposition and dialogue, with shots that feel plucked from the cutting-room floor of Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven. This will drive some viewers mad, but they're probably the same people who grow bored with long, descriptive literary passages.An astonishing Emile Hirsch, channeling the looks and intensity of a young DiCaprio, portrays McCandless, the troubled grad who, rather than the follow his bourgeois parents' (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) path into an Ivy League law school, decides to torch his money, abandon his car and all material possessions, and explore the American landscape on a journey to a symbolic Alaska. He encounters a couple of bus-driving hippie throwbacks (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), a pair of friendly Scandinavian tourists and a farmer who offers him work (an oddly cast Vince Vaughn). Backstory is revealed intermittently and elegantly through the narration of his sister back home (Jena Malone), and we gradually come to understand the psychological impetus for Christopher's escape into a nut-and-berry-eating, hunting-and-gathering regression. Long but never rambling, the story eventually finds Christopher meeting up with a widowed old-timer (Hal Holbrook, surely a lock for Best Supporting Actor) with whom he bonds in tender and poignant scenes.The movie's tones and textures are so well-captured, the ambiance so authentic and the performances so subtle and genuine that the characters' emotions – euphoria, freedom, danger, nausea – become ours, in a poetically realized and harrowing vision of one man's incompatibility with the modern world.All of the movie's potentially dubious tricks work: the way the gripping text from McCandless' journal flows across the frame, making us hang on every word; the screenplay's wise adages, exchanged not as false, homespun platitudes but the grizzled truth of lived experience; and the score by Eddie Vedder, whose normally agonizing warble becomes a mournful cry from the protagonist's soul.",8,0,2,8 August 2014
War Machine," Confusion in tone
","War Machine is a recent straight to Netflix film starring Brad Pitt. After several box office flops, the best and most obvious outcome for leading actor Brad Pitt is for Netflix services. War Machine appears to be based on true events and is described as a war comedy-drama. However, this film has a confusing tone and often settles on what it appears to wanting to be. It stands out not as a comedy as in the film isn't funny but is more light hearted in tone, and plays somewhat of a parody of a serious war film such as Lone Survivor or the Hurt Locker, then shifts towards a more darker toned drama film, with very few action scenes. Overall, War Machine was not worth the hype it has received, as the film is quite uninteresting (for a true based story) and is rather boring. The performances are quite decent, as Brad Pitt is able to play a different type of character than his typical characters. Though the main problem, are the supporting cast, as they are not interesting enough characters for us the audience to care and sympathize for an entire two hours.",3,6,12,9 June 2017
Elysium," Brings New Definition to Sci-Fi Films
","Elysium is the follow up from the director which brought us District 9. Both are distant films with its differences and one reason why Elysium is not receiving as its due it being constantly compared to the former District 9. In Elysium the visuals are stunning and visually amazing which makes the audience perplex its thoughts and it gravitates are minds. I am in agreement with several critics that the storyline was not as appealing or interesting but with the visuals, and likable lead character in Max (Matt Damon), Elysium is a wonderful ride.The film brings a new definition to sci-fi films as we have not seen before. Not only are there new techniques and visuals, but we are more than aware of the emotion borough upon in the film. The characters are life-like and we want to see Matt Damon succeed. The supporting cast of Jodie Foster and Shartlo Copley as the villain do bring in the film as we see more of him towards the end of the film. The film shifts and changes towards the end while it can somewhat become more apparent as a slasher film, although still very good to watch. The very last few scenes are not quite as clear as I feel there could have been more explanations and reasonings",8,2,3,31 December 2014
Taken," Delivers on Action and Suspense
","Taken has been widely considered a great cinematic action film experience as it combines action and suspense and overall thrills from start to finish. Having seen the sequels before the original, one can agree that the original does live up to the hype and is massively more concise and arguably the best film of the franchise. Liam Neeson plays his role as one should and is convincing in the role, as well as the supporting cast of the daughter played by Maggie Grace and his ex-wife played by Famke Janssen. Another great thing about Taken is the length of the film, as we have seen many action films drag on with little subplots we do not care for, but with Taken the film isn't too long and every piece of screen time is vital. Overall, Taken delivers on what it should as an intense and thrilling action piece of art.

As a rewatch (12/03/18') Taken remains a very filling and thought provoking entertaining ride. Full of twists and turns we can see as to why the original is considered the best in the trilogy.",8,1,1,15 October 2017
Alice in Wonderland," Nice visual effects but lacking in interesting storyline
","The special effects and scenery was great but the story was just lacking imagination and creativity and it ended up becoming rather boring. Its about a 19 year old Alice who is unexpectedly getting married to a man she doesn't like, then after a few incidents involving a rabbit, she decides to follow him then she ends up down a rabbit whole which leads to Wonderland. Once there, she explores the world and meets new characters. I disliked the characters in the movie. They seemed boring and rather annoying. Especially Alice, her character was annoying because of her accent and the way she did things. She didn't seem interested in the story and it was some bad acting. I didn't care much about the other characters (Mad Hater, Red Queen, White Queen, etc.). The effects looked nice but the story was just boring to follow and wasn't as interesting as I expected. It was a let-down.",2,3,6,24 October 2010
Avatar," Lives up to the hype...Incredible!!
","I just finished watching this movie on DVD and it was incredible. I agree with many of the critics and reviews. This movie takes the art and creations to another level. There's a lot of good feelings going on for this film, and rightly so. After a Summer of lackluster crap, along comes this magnificent film. For once the hype was actually deserved. I won't talk about the plot, this film is best seen with as little information as possible. I didn't really expect the creation and picture to be this great but it was unreal. The picture truly is amazing I didn't expect the emotional impact, but Cameron is a master at pushing all the right buttons, and he does so here masterfully.I know there were many bad critics, and some of them have reasons for hate. Most of them have criticisms of the plot. Some of the criticism lies in the 'surface' quality of the plot, but again, Cameron has never made deep, cerebral films. Cameron is an entertainer, and thank God for it. This film is pure, futuristic, ahead of it's time escapism. I was absolutely floored. It shows the world beyond a world. Its an outstanding journey and was a great thing to finally watch this film",10,1,6,14 July 2010
Frank," Quite odd film in a good way
","Frank is a relatively unknown and limited released independent film. Starring Domhnall Gleeson (as Jon), an untalented rock-star wannabe, gets a lucky break when, on an English beach, he meets Don (Scoot McNairy), who manages an art-rock band. Furthermore very quickly, Don hires Jon to replace the group's suicidal keyboardist. A gig in Ireland and an album-recording project in a lakeside cabin are on tap.The band is led by Frank (Michael Fassbender wearing a large paper- mache type head mask), whose music reflects mental illness as well as talent and who never takes off his above-mentioned mask. Frank shows kindness and support to Jon, while the other band members tend to dislike him. Also followed by, hostile is theremin player Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who maintains a strong protective (and romantic) interest in Frank. Jon is clueless to Frank's fragility. He also doesn't understand the band's disinterest in commercial success.This film is quite well written and acted well, which is why it is an entertaining watch. Michael Fassbender played as Frank is easily the star and most likable and watchable on screen in this film. The audience is eager to watch whatever he does, and the main reason is with him wearing the mask over his head. The comedy in the film isn't laugh out loud which works here as it is not forced, and more subtle. Frank is relatively short in running time, where they perhaps could have added about 10-15 more minutes, but otherwise the film is quite interesting and unique as it is entertaining.",7,0,0,2 May 2017
There's Something About Mary," Genuinely funny raunchy romantic comedy
","After over 21 years since its release and having watching this film for the first time, can say that expectations were met. Of course having heard much praise about this film in regards to it being one of the better romantic comedies, as well as one of the Farrelly brothers best films.What makes the film great and entertaining are not only the performances from the main cast of Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz and Matt Dillon bit that it isn't completely predictable and the humor works.Many have claimed that the comedy is too gross or low brow but that is the style of the Farrelly brothers. And given that, this is more than a typical rom-com which is perhaps what some people had not initially realized prior to viewing. Though the raunchy and subtle gross out humor is what makes this movie more enjoyable.The pace of the film moves solid with it being under two hours but there is plenty of things that occur along the way keeping one on the edge of their seat.",9,1,2,11 October 2019
La La Land," For fans of musicals
","La La Land since its release has received a lot of praise and due from critics and award shows, having earning several Oscar awards as well as other prestigious awards. Just as with every film that received high praise from critics and wins a ton of awards, there will be a lot of backlash and critics among casual movie goers alike. For those whom don't like too much musicals may not enjoy this film as this film offers plenty in that area. The story is well decent and the acting and visuals complete it. La La Land is quite decent but the story is something in which we have seen before (at times the film reminds of a musical version of the Notebook). Was not much of a fan of some of the musicals they had as one found them to be not as interesting and forgettable. Overall, if you are not a fan of old fashion type musicals, or predictable romance stories, La Land Land may not be for you, as one should not try to force the film to enjoy it.",6,0,1,12 November 2017
Up," Rediculiously overrated!
","I finally got around to watching this film after last year it being released. Since its arrival, it had many great things said from critics about it; saying how it was so good and all. Many promos had tags such as 'funniest movie of the summer' and 'best Pixar film. These both lines are outrageously wrong. Up is nowhere near funny, it is actually quite depressing. They simply showed the funny scenes in the trailer but the actual movie was not funny. Right from the beginning, we see the old man as a kid being forced by his future wife (as a kid) to like him, and eventually it starts from there. They eventually get married, live a happily nice life then a few short scenes of pictures with background music, they show the wife dying in a hospital then there, she is dead. That's not funny.The characters weren't great. The old man was grumpy, and cruel. The kid was fat (a little under obese), bratty and annoying. He had privacy problems which was well showed in the film. The villain was boring and far too aggressive for a kids movie. Also there were talking dogs and a large bird. There were so many things confusing and not right about the film, such as some scenes that showed blood, and a scene with dogs attacking them. Also a scene where the villain captures and ties the kid (Russell) on a chair trying to kill him by sending him down a ramp (though the old man eventually saves him). I seriously don't see why this film was so praised, it is completely misleading and not great. Bland storyline, and uninteresting plot. It is vastly overrated, and shouldn't be in the top 250.",1,24,77,25 August 2010
Snowden," For a certain Propaganda audience
","These type of recent true event propaganda 'questioning the government' based drama films have a very specific audience and won't be liked by most. It does require full attention to detail and most notable a certain interest in the subject matter. For those not very familiar with this news outlet upon the real story, may not be too interested. Having not been too familiar with the details of the actual story oneself, expectations weren't too high since I did not know much what to expect.Snowden is a well crafted, directed and acted film. Joseph Gordon- Levitt is a star in his portrayal of Snowden as he makes the character more likable than he should be (which is a good thing). Shailene Woodley is also quite good in her role as Snowden's preposterous girlfriend. The film isn't as gripping or suspenseful as it could have been but it is still quite intriguing and entertaining as a whole. Though this film may be considered quite a disappointment, in terms of box office success and critical acclaim. It very well felt like a blatant Oscar bait film and it received no love from the Acadamy. The film was also a box office flop, only making $37 million worldwide on a $40 million budget, not too surprising considering this isn't a film which would do well in foreign markets, and since the reviews weren't that positive it was more than likely to flop. Another thing which hurt the film was it being rated R. They easily could have and should have toned it down for a PG-13 rating. With only one sex scene (which didn't show much) and a bit too many F-bombs, it wasn't as needed, which I think hurt it's box office. If the Social Network was able to get away with a PG-13 rating, Snowden should have been too. As being compared to the Social Network, Snowden isn't on that level, and is quite the disappointment. Though Snowden does make one think about real security in the end. Passable film but also forgettable.",7,1,2,20 July 2017
Woman in Gold," For a certain audience
","Woman in Gold is based upon true events telling a supposed true based story. These biopic films are most definitely difficult at relating towards and often times enjoying, if we are interested in the story it tells. This film is more so centered towards a certain audience, but overall this film is more so dull and boring at times than it is enjoyable and interesting. Good performances from the leads but far too many flashback scenes that take up space from the movie. For a true story with an interesting premise, Woman in Gold is rather dull and forgettable.",3,5,11,21 August 2017
National Treasure," Cleverly Entertaining
","National Treasure (2004) starring Nicolas Cage, is one of his biggest films to date. Released back in November 2004, the film was considered a surprise hit, which eventually lead its way to a sequel. The enjoyment of this film isn't in its suspense, there's surprisingly little of it. The clues come too easily but are made cleverly for audiences to grasp at. The two lead actors don't seem much interested in each other, and the writers don't seem much interested in them. Though what engages in the film is the clever script that does work and is entertaining. National Treasure has received mixed reviews, all some are justified but for a film such as this (aimed towards a younger audience) many critics can be as harsh.Within what we see, including the prized document, the fascinating tours of the historical halls and passageways and ventilation shafts and catacombs we get as the good guys try to outrun the bad, gives the movie a sometimes irresistible ambiance. Although quite over the top in some scenes, it makes it an entertaining and fun thrill ride.",8,1,1,15 June 2016
How to Train Your Dragon," Visually entertaining
","There's lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it's mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there's still danger. However, despite that lack of 'realism', I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. The effects and animation is stunning. Very well done.The story was entertaining to watch and it didn't really drag on like other animated films. One thing I didn't really like, is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. Very clichéd and should have been better in my opinion",7,4,9,23 December 2010
Limitless," Interesting concept and delivery
","As a thriller Limitless works on both ends. The film offers an interesting concept and message and as the film goes, we see the development and balance as the film progresses. Starts with a relatively slow start then once the film settles in becomes an interesting watch. The film was relatively a decent hit, making $161 million on a $27 million budget, but wonders as to why a sequel never occurred (instead they made a brief tv series years later)Overall the plot clips along with camera tricks that mirror Eddie's increasingly confused state. Bradley Cooper's knack for slipping from cocksure to self-assured is a delight to watch. His performance, the kinetic energy of the direction by Neil Burger, and a looming sense of dread over the physical and mental toll taken by operating at such a high pitch of efficiency buoy the proceedings along. The plot, it's clever, making a fine distinction between being smart and being savvy, and then hinging the outcome on it without giving too much away in the process.",7,0,0,5 April 2018
Sicario," Great performances elevate intriguing
","Sicario has been described as another crime drama based on the war of Mexico-USA border. Though, Sicario does many things well such as its storytelling and the overall plot. The film has a slow build up within its first hour but afterwards becomes very much quick paced and more intriguing and engaging. The performances from its leads is what elevates the film as it becomes a much more enjoyable and deserving watch. Especially by Benecio Del Toro as he steals his scenes within the second half. Josh Brolin plays his role well, as does Emily Blunt as the central character (although we can see as to why her character is considered the worst of the three).Sicario was not as big of a success at the box office (making $85 million on a $30 million budget) but since it has been praised from critics and fans, a sequel is on its way next year, as we expect bigger success than the original. As the film passes, it becomes more intense which is always a positive for thrillers. Although not many twists are included, the film becomes a much watch. Highly recommend.
As a rewatch 05/16/19' Sicario remains one of the finer drug cartel drama thrillers to date. Position stand by the characters, with Del Toro being the most intriguing character between him, Josh Brolin and Emily Blunt.",9,0,1,19 November 2017
Inside Man," Intelligent heist film
","Spike Lee's Inside Man starring Denzel Washington has been heavily praised since its release in 2006, both as a bank heist film and an overall crime drama.This film is quite unique and different than the typical heist film in a sense where the drama had a slow build but a worthy of suspense and thrills. The acting is top notch from both Washington and Clive Owen. Jodie Foster was seemingly thrown in and was about the worst part of this great film.Otherwise, Inside Man delivers what was expected as an entertaining crime mystery heist film. Even with a run time of over two hours, the film moves at a solid pace where time seems to go quickly (meaning it's a good thing). Highly recommend for fans of Spike Lee, or Denzel or fans of well made heist films.",9,1,2,2 December 2018
Pulp Fiction," Transcends through quality
","Pulp Fiction as with any landmark movie, more has been written about it than would surely. The type of wild and hysterical ranting that has surrounded this picture can be a little off-putting. But it's hard to over sell a movie that is so supremely confident in writing and direction. Despite an almost audience-annihilating run time of nearly two and a half-hours, it is consistently absorbing.Director and co-writer Quentin Tarantino is courteous enough to credit the viewer with some intelligence. This time the tale is far more sprawling and complex, but it also rewards and satisfies. As with many films considered classics, Pulp Fiction may seem out of date to many viewers watching the film for the first time, in recent memory.",8,1,2,12 January 2016
Jack Reacher," A mix of action films into one
","Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise sees him playing the title character in this mystery, spy action thriller. Having no knowledge of the novel series, one could not compare Tom Cruise's performance to how the character in the novel is supposed to be depicted. Although, in presence I may agree with several critics and fans of the novel, that he may have been miscast. His performance seems to be lacking in any spark and he comes off as too unenergetic and not as mysterious or silent as he should have, according to some others. Though perhaps with another leading man as the title role, this film would not have been as successful.The story isn't too bland but it seems like a recycle of many past action thrillers we have seen already. There is the typical scene plot with the female lead being hostaged by the villains than the lead has to come and save her, then killing the villains. It has all been done before many times, and it was very predictable in here. The mystery is only for the characters in the film having not sure what is going on, but we the audience already known everything which leaves little suspense. The running time is 130 mins and feels like it. Another thing with the film is that at no point we feel that Jack Reacher is in real any danger, and they make him completely invincible. Despite some decent action scenes, Jack Reacher isn't as fun as it should be. It's more of a serious toned film and with Tom Cruise's presence it comes off as awkward and quite silly. Jack Reacher is no Jason Bourne or James Bond",4,0,0,30 July 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Solid adventure
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 is the highly anticipated sequel of the original hit released back in 2014. Did enjoy the first installment somewhat but felt it could have been better at some points. This film seems to capitalize more on the original as we are more comfortable with or crew. This one does have more sense of humor which is an added, more characters giving us more and overall somewhat more dept.The entertainment is still there and the visuals are as great as ever. Both films are about on par with each other, as there are both things each one does better and worse than the others. Highly recommend.",8,0,0,5 April 2019
Thor," Nothing special
",Thor (2011) is the first film in its franchise and was received with several positive feedback. Overall the movie does have a decent feel and solid scenery but the story is quite basic and bland. Not as great as lead to believe and isn't anything special. The character of Thor just isn't too interesting and a full length feature film about him doesn't exactly fulfill its potential.,3,0,0,7 February 2020
The Happening," Good concept but disappoints
","The Happening seemed to have potential from its concept and the idea but the overall execution and writing of the film collapses. A main reason why the film is harshly criticized is because of the acting from the leads Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. They seemed miscast and it was hard to take Wahlberg serious as a Science teacher and the chemistry between them two seemed almost fake (at least in the first 45 mins).The film starts off promising, drags around in the middle then picks up and becomes a more thriller suspense in the last 30 minutes. From around the part when they meet the older lady Ms Jones, I feel as if the films picks up and start becoming a little more interested. Still crazy in concept but it was more enjoyable from this point on. From there, we see her helping them in her house, feeding them and of course acting suspicious towards them. Once her characters exits out, we then see Wahlberg and Deschanel try and survive in her house then they eventually end of leaving. We last see them curled up in the outhouse, then it cuts a blank screen and a tagline shows 'three months later', and everything seems fine and normal. Fee like this ending was a copout and Shyamalan could have thought of a better ending. As a rewatch 05/04/20' The Happening remains an overall disappointment in concept film. It has some moments of entertainment as already highlighted but a majority of the film is quite boring and plain. There isn't much of a climax.",3,1,2,16 July 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," Delivers on Action and Thrills
","The Matrix Reloaded (2003) is the highly anticipated sequel to the classic once in a lifetime film The Matrix (1999). This film may be somewhat confusing on the regular but within exploring more about the initial outline and plot of the film, one can become much more involved and have a better understanding at what this film is closely about. Within the film, we first notice something where it sets the film as a set up. It is Neo having nightmares about Trinity's ultimate fate where he sees her falling down from somewhere in fear, but he doesn't reach the full end of this nightmare as each time he sees this, he then wakes up in distraught fear. Then we have Morpheus defending his decision to remove the Nebuchadnezzar from the first line of defense and shows renewed interest in his ex-lover, Captain Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). In the meantime, we get our first glimpse of Zion where the main floor with its rusted iron walkways and power generators looks like the remodeled boiler room of the Titanic. Neo learns that he must find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) who alone can provide him with entry to the mysterious source that controls the Matrix.The Matrix Reloaded delivers some of the best special effects of that time and they are sensational and several action sequences stand out. Easily the most memorable and stand-out portion of the film which excels is a 15-minute freeway chase involving cars, motorbikes, semis, and a samurai sword. All this involves special effects that are, in their own way, as cutting-edge as the much- copied 'bullet time' technique from the first film, if subtler in appearance.The Matrix Reloaded is a great action film with much sense and is visually concrete, however as a sequel to a classic in The Matrix, it is not necessarily the same as it falls somewhat short. Which isn't that bad but predictable. We understood that it would be rare and very difficult to create a duplicate of the original, but this film is solid and has a massive following.",7,1,2,17 February 2017
The Disaster Artist," Unique take on a true based story
","The Disaster Artist has been quite hyped up and praised among critics during its released, During these type of films, the art of these films is how continued and consistent they are into true based story. Having low expectations and seeing the Room for the first time a few years back, memory of the film wasn't too vapid.The Disaster Artist truly does live up to the hype as a film which is generally funny throughout and inspires a true developing message. The high praise for James Franco is worthy as he steals his scenes as he delivers one ofhis better performances acting comparible to Tommy Wiseau in the film.Many scenes in the film are funny in an unintentional way due to the delivery of Franco, as well as the chemistry between him and broth Dave Franco. It's quite a shame this film did not receive as much Oscar awards as well as money at the box office office. Though with a small budget of $10, the Disaster Artist went on to make slightly under $30 million worldwide. Overall, the Disaster Artist lives up to the hype and is a generational film. Well done to the entire cast.
===
As a rewatch 01/15/18' the Disaster Artist remains a high quality highly and entertaining film. The humor and overall chemistry between James Franco as Tommy Wiseau and Dave Franco as Greg is what makes this film separable. Filled with many funny lines and an overall charm, the Disaster Artist lives up to its hype. As the film is better on a second viewing.",10,3,4,13 June 2018
The Fountain," Confusing and overhyped
","Somewhere in which this film has become relatively known as divided many people and critics. There seem to be people who genuinely love this film and consider a masterpiece while others despise it and find it overrated. With a current IMDB rating of 7.3, one thinks this film is quite overrated and not nearly as good as many audience reviews are claiming.Having an open mind and not knowing too much about the film, one was severely quite bored for most of the film, as it was generally slightly confusing with its transitions from scene to scene, its time differences and overall lack of explaining.Many good reviews claim that the people who didn't like the Fountain ' didn't understand or get the film'. The film is quite pretentious and overly overdone. There are some creative moments but in general, everything about the film is lacking of excitement.The Fountain only runs at 96 minutes (90 minutes excluding end credits) but some reason feels much longer (which isn't a good thing). In the end, one was disappointed by the film and thought it would be better.",3,2,5,8 March 2019
Zombieland," Entertaining zombie film
","The story itself is not complicated at all. Pretty much what you see in the trailer is what you get story-wise. There is no explanation for what's going on and there are no 'bad guys' other than zombies. It's just four 'friends' (lack of a better word) surviving the apocalypse. This isn't a bad thing because it provides so much entertainment! The film really hits the mark with the humor. It's crazy how dead-on the humor is. The actors also brought a lot the their roles (especially Woody Harrelson) and each one was a PERFECT choice.Although it is a very funny movie, it never lends itself to being a true comedy because it is filled with scares and awesomely grotesque violence. Nothing like a good banjo to the face.The best part of the film was the violence. Seriously, if you aren't watching a brutal, slow motion kill, you're watching Woody Harrelson kick zombie ass like a pro. Zombie fans need not worry because these zombies are vicious and bleed a LOT.Though the film felt a little more like a romantic comedy with some of its elements towards the end. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I can see why many were disappointed by this. Maybe without these clichés this film would have been better.One thing that may leave viewers disliking this film more is Bill Murray's cameo. There are of course a lot of complaints about his short cameo, and I agree. His cameo really felt out of place and just was not needed. Though there are also those whom praise his cameo.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/01/17' Zombieland is as I have remembered from the first viewing. Not much of a plot, just four people trying got survive the apocalypse, while defeating the zombies. The movie is quite fun and doesn't take itself too serious which in many films is a way to ruin the mood. Zombieland made over $100 million worldwide with a $24 million budget, we are surprised this film did not spun a sequel. As another rewatch 05.14.20' and after watching the sequel, opinions remain same towards this film. It feels better in different aspects compared to the sequel, while it may be more simplistic (with less characters) yet the comedy isn't forced. The ending climax at the amusement park is also very similar to the ending on the sequel. Yet it is delivered better here.",8,0,2,29 October 2011
The Departed," Intense and Gripping Throughout
","The Departed as many as declared as Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. What's surprising here is that this is not an awards seeking film rather The Departed is purely a thoroughly entertaining mainstream blockbuster designed more to be enjoyed than to be analyzed. The Departed has been praised for several years, especially since it's immediate release. It is a great example of the difference that a visionary director can bring to relatively conventional material.The overall premise is clever, the action is gripping, production values solid all around. What really makes it stand out though, aside from Scorsese's style, is simply how much good fun it is. Laughs come frequently and loudly throughout the film, with almost all being character based rather than cheesy one-liners or goofy sight gags. The result is some tremendously smart and snappy dialogue interplays mixed with scenes which give the actors room to breathe and add their own style. As a rewatch 03/16/20' the Departed remains a great and highly entertaining watch, and one of the greater crime drama's of its time.",10,2,3,13 October 2015
Die Hard," Generational Franchise starter
","Die Hard has become a cultural phenomenon of the action genre since its release, and with the releases of its four and counting sequels. Having finally watched the film for the first time, one can see as to why the film is as praised and beloved as it is.Bruce Willis brings the charisma, and overall do-whatever in his character of John McClane that his overall presence is what carries the film, which turned him into the action star we saw in his career.As for the film, since it is quite lengthy in running time, there are enough action scenes to entertain. Along with campy one liners from Bruce Willis, and other likable supporting characters including a limo driver, and officer helping McClane.Though the plot is quite standard, and somewhat stalls at points, the film does have enough punch to elevate. Although, Die Hard may feel somewhat over hyped, it is fun none the less. Overall good film. As a rewatch 08/11/19' Die Hard remains a highly entertaining watch and the best film of the series.",8,0,0,20 December 2018
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," An uneasy and bland sequel
","Tranformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is the 2009 follow up to the Massive smash, minor critical hit is nothing short of dull, overly plotted, over crowed and most of all dumb. The problem with this film is that it tries way too hard to be funny. All those little gags from the twin autobots, and weak dialogue weren't funny or great Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nothing short of a good idea gone bad, Michael Bay tries and fails to bring up the value of the sequel to his adequate adaption of the popular kids show and toy line. But there are three main reasons that it failed. 1.) It's dull, overlong and it doesn't follow any strict set of rules or even a coherent plot for that matter. 2.) It's terrible and bland acting on most part of the cast brings down the high production values of this film. But to no avail they don't succeed very well. 3.) It's just a plain, old good car with bad parts. All in all this film could have been so much better.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is dumb fun, it uses flashy and stylish CGI rock'em sock'em robot fights, an alluring female lead and bad jokes to entertain. But it fails miserable in it's attempt to be good and plausible entertainment. It drags along for way too long and is very boring at times. But on the bright side it is great fun and a good thrill ride to enjoy. But nothing more. All in all it was a shallow attempt at making a franchise that has been around for more than 30 years and turns it into a bad film. All in all Revenge of the Fallen is an A-Bomb.The truth about this Transformers movie is that it's 147 painful minutes of thoughtless special effects action. Director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg comes to the table with very little plot, themes, complex sentences, and characterization to speak of. But for the targeted audience, teens and tweens, that's alright. So if you're ready for some reckless violence, rather good reckless violence I might add, then go check out Transformers this weekend. Hell, I'd even go during your regular Sunday nap time, and just take one somewhere in the boundless middle of the movie. It was as bad as people made it out to be. WOW",2,1,9,31 August 2010
The Witch," Underwhelming
","Having thought the Witch having potential given the content and overall story. After watching the film, was left dissappointed and somewhat underwlehmed. The film isn't nearly as horror or thrilling as lead to believe, and at times the pacing is very much slow. Quite boring at some parts. Though the set and visuals is well done, the story is quite simple and nothing too bizarre occurs.With some decent scenes, though the film does get betterafter its mid-way point (around which Caleb- the older brother enocounters a witch then later dies whil being 'possessed' and 'spirited' surrpunedd by his family).Much of the dialogue is quite different to understand given the accent and dialect, which is better to watch the film with subtitles on. Assumed there would be more jump scares or thrills but for the most part, the Witch was quite tame.Besides a few killings (one by their devil black goat named 'Black Phillip' and another by its lead Anya Taylor-Joy to her mother- in a casual and predictable manner). A lot of religious undertones are present in the film",3,2,5,12 January 2019
War of the Worlds," Lesser alien invasion movie
","War of the Worlds was a highly anticipated film directed by Steven Spielberg starring Tom Cruise. The film is apparently a remake of an older Hollywood film. Some decent entertainment but as a whole the film fails to be completely intriguing. The father-children relationship dilemma takes over more so than the alien invasion story. And with the children, both (but mainly the son) were highly unlikable.Within War of the Worlds a real problem is that the film tries to play the story of the invasion a lot like Signs (2002) but that film had much more intrigued, suspense and overall likable characters. We can see as to why this film was such a big box office hit but overall, it isn't nearly as great as expected.",5,1,2,24 June 2019
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Disappointing and pointless
","I found Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist to be somewhat boring and very lame. The movie was very pointless and the writers tried to make it like real life. That was the problem. It had no plot. It was just about Nick (Michael Cera) who meets a girl at a concert- Norah, they don't know each other but they're friends and friends with one another (they have connections to others). The intro to each character was real lame and stupid. All the characters in this were annoying and I was hard to actually care what was going to happen. I didn't care for the character's at all.The problem is mainly to do with the fact that the characters just aren't all that interesting and are hard to sympathise with; both Nick and Norah, and also their friends, are essentially anxious and/or lazy teens. Their worries are not really all that sincere and I soon lost interest in them. Norah's drunken friend - the obvious comic-relief figure - is also just not all that amusing. Perhaps if I were a few years younger and still felt like a breakup or a friend being gay were a major dramatic event worthy of international media coverage, then I would feel differently. But I think that to anyone over the age of 17, these characters and their misadventures would seem bland.The film, I should mention, takes place over the course of a night, and ends at around 5 or 6 in the morning. I became so bored, however, that I kept on posing myself the question: wouldn't all these people just want to go to bed by this point? In the first hour the basic whole plot was just them going around partying, going to bars/restaurants, and to find their drunk friend. The rest of the film from the time they find they bimbo was them trying to find a band. It got real boring from the last 30 mins",2,5,7,1 September 2010
30 Days of Night," Quite slow and off putting
","Nothing completely memorable occurs in this film. The plot is nothing special but the scenery is nice to look at (the winter snow scene is different in zombie/vampire type films). So for one, that makes it stand out somewhat.There are some jump scares but after a while everything becomes repetitive. None of the characters tend to stand out, except perhaps Ben Foster though he isn't in the film too much.Seeing a majority of positive reviews from the top reviews and cannot understand why. A lot of praise about how scary or gory the film is, but the horror really isn't much.There are lots of blood and kills by the vampires and it is gruesome to look at but the majority of it is rather boring.Also the lead character's motive in the end was bizarre and very strange. It made little sense as to why he thought of that after 30 days- as in why didn't he do it sooner.The plot of this movie isn't interesting or engaging enough. The visuals are nice, the vampires aren't exactly intriguing either. Below average film, expected more suspense, more thrills and a more engaging storyline.",4,0,0,18 May 2020
Sausage Party," Vulgar, crude and clever
","Sausage Party was a major success for R rated animated films. Having a lot of hype and expectations gong into the film and during the filming process, Sausage Party exceeded my expectations as this film was well done and the jokes and humor match the point of the film. It appears many people found the jokes and humor in bad taste but it as meant to be as offensive, and it worked. The IMDb rating at the moment (6.2) is quite low as well the Rotten Tomatoes audience score (50%). Sausage Party can be defined as an R-rated version of Toy Story. Overall Sausage Party is quite clever and is constantly entertaining and funny. One of the more funny films of 2016.",9,2,4,4 November 2017
Wedding Crashers," very good movie
","I watched wedding crashers last night, and I found it to be a very funny and entertaining comedy. The movie had many hilarious scenes and had a great plot. I've read many bad reviews about this movie, but they're mostly wrong. The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn is great. They worked surprisingly really well together, and although I've really grown to dislike Vaughn, I found him to be hilarious in this, and actually thought that he portrayed his character very well. Wilson as usual was hysterical and nailed every line to the 'T'. Also towards the end, Will Ferrell makes a short appearance where he is actually funny (funeral crasher). Altogether I enjoyed this movie and found it to be very funny. Id recommend people to go see it.",8,1,2,22 November 2009
Joker," Different in a good light
","Joker has been one of the most anticipated and hype movies of the year and the hype began when Joaquin Phoenix was cast as Joker. The hype for the film is accurate as this is a great and entertaining film. This isn't a typical 'superhero' film but more of a crime drama, based upon the origin story.The acting by Joaquin was top notch as expected and will sure give him plenty of award season nominations. The supporting cast is great as well. What makes this film as good as it is, is not only the performances but the writing and story is interesting. This is a far different Joker than in the previous Batman films. Also a really good thing the studios didn't tone this movie down, as it's R-rating most definitely have it more of a realistic edge, than a PG-13 rating would.",9,1,3,14 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Thrilling Action Succeeds
","Edge of Tomorrow (2014) is a greatly made action sci-fi film starring Tom Cruise. The other valuable members on this team are Doug Liman, one of the most skilled action-movie directors in Hollywood, and co-star Emily Blunt, who lives up to her surname and is never less than an equal partner in this enterprise.As noted by several, Edge of Tomorrow is based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's militaristic science-fiction novel All You Need is Kill, which finds the armies of Earth being dismantled by Mimics, an invading alien force that in the movie looks like piranha/jellyfish hybrids made of steel and cranked up to 100 mph for attacks.",10,1,4,3 March 2015
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Great action paced
","Die Hard with a Vengeance is the third film of the Die Hard franchise, and quite different than the previous two. We see Bruce Willis return as the resourceful cop with a knack for survival. In the first two, McClane stumbled into situations outside his jurisdiction and had no choice but to save the day.This time, he's at home in New York City when a maniac setting off bombs directs his rage at McClane. He's got to save the day again. Here we see a slightly co-starring appearance from Samuel L. Jackson, which may have stood out.The film is quite clever with the directions from the villains regarding what John McClane must do with the orders sent, as it is entertaining to watch then complete them. The chemistry between Willis and Jackson is what elevates the film as a whole, perhaps not better than the original but there is still some decent amounts of entertainment and joy. As a rewatch 08/09/19' this third film of the franchise remains very solid.",7,0,0,22 December 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not too funny as its been said
","Hail, Caesar! is another Coen Brothers film and this film takes place during the 1950's. Described as a comedy, though this film's humor is very much subjective as most of what is occurring isn't quite funny. No laughs, but some decent scenes by the musicals and overall chemistry of the cast. Hail, Caesar may be considered one of the Coen Brothers more disappointing films as this film had much hype surrounding it leading up to its release, especially considering the cast. Though the highlight of the film is the character of relatively new comer and future star Alden Ehrenreich. The leads of Josh Brolin and George Clooney play their typical act. Scarlett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill don't have as much screen time as their names were advertised. It did not produce as well at the box office as the studios expected and it appears this film was not as successful or liked among movie goers. This is more of a required taste but one can understand why many reviews are saying it is boring and doesn't offer much of interest. One take is that this film tries too hard at being funny and different that it misses the mark, and the overall plot of the film and setting isn't too engaging.",4,0,2,12 November 2017
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Not as funny or good as its written out to be
","I came across this film, and thought while watching it that it wasn't really funny or good. Many people (critics and fans) wrote positive reviews about his film saying that its really funny and Will Ferrell and the cast shine. Well, I strongly disagree. The film is not that bad but its not that good either. Its a very basic comedy starring Wil Ferll and the plot is pretty predictable and silly. First he's the lead anchorman, then Christina Applegate (Veronica Cornerstone) comes in the picture and all the workers try hitting on her. She then says she wants to be an anchorman also like Ron Burgundy. First they have little disputes then they eventually fall for each other. She ends up taking his job, he gets mad and gets fired fro cursing on the air. Something happens in the middle. The crew call Ron back when Veronica is somehow lost and he surprisingly comes back and does the news again. he covers it well, saves her and everything seems fine again. The comedy really isn't that funny, the jokes are just sexual and slapstick type humour. Their were some funny scenes but not enough throughout the entire film. As a rewatch 09.03.19' opinions remain same. Film isn't as funny and feels forced. Somewhat entertaining but not nearly as much as it has been praised to be.",4,1,3,10 September 2010
Stranger Than Fiction," Quite good but expected a little more
","Stranger than Fiction is labelled a comedy but is really more a drama. Though there were some parts that may be considered comedic. I can't really say I was disappointed with this movie, but it wasn't what I had expected. The plot was pretty fun and seemed original; the thought of a woman's voice following a man around had always amused me. But the problem is I don't think the movie lived up to its name. Although this movie is described as a comedy, I didn't laugh once the whole film, it was a bit more of a love story and drama, which disappointed me. And many parts seemed to drag on a little, and they felt boring at times. The ending of the film was pretty good though predictable. It was obvious that Harold wouldn't die and that Karen Eiffel felt some sympathy towards him after meeting him in person. It was also kind of odd that she was able to meet him. I first though that she was living in another fantasy world which Harold and Karen never meet. From the meeting with one another the film seemed quite predictable that he wouldn't die. Because of the fact that the movie had a good plot and the acting was great, it could've been a lot better. Though maybe it just wasn't my type of film. ==================================================================== ====== After a rewatch (03/30/17'), this film is more understood than on my initial first watching. The acting by Will Ferrell is very solid as he takes quite a different dramatic take here. The supporting characters of Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Dustin Hoffman do their part in helping carrying the film along. The film is quite more dramatic than comedic and unique in its own right, though can feel quite slow and predictable at times.",6,1,2,17 October 2010
Hancock," Sub-par super hero movie
","This movie is an okay movie but id say its a sub-par superhero movie. It started out good and actually kept going that way for about the first 50 minutes but then it all comes crashing down almost immediately. It was as if the writers gave up after the first half and decided to write something that would appeal to Hollywood. I was actually impressed at how quickly this movie went downhill.The story, what can I say about the story? let's be honest, it sucks. even the first half didn't have much of a story going for it. However, when the second half roles around, you'll wish they didn't try to add more of a plot because the lack of one would have actually worked with this film. The ending is really weird, Hancock tries to kill himself multiple times and he eventually starts losing his powers. Its wack how they showed the guy beating him up and trying to kill Mary. It tries far too hard to be inspirational and 'cool.' They should have kept going with the comedy thing and it would have been fine. It still wouldn't have been a great movie by any means but it would have been better than what the final product turned out to be. The scene where Hancock finds out that Mary has powers is weird. It seems that the movie falls downhill since. Wait until you can see this movie for free because it isn't worth the price of admission. ============================================================ ============== As for a rewatch after several years later (02/26/17') Hancock is a piece of film which could have been better. Their are many flaws but Will Smith's portrayal as the title character is good enough and gives enough edge to keep watching this film. The film does start off convincing and entertaining and comical than once Hancock finds about the truth about Charlize Theron's character, is when the film goes downhill. The films becomes more serious and her character and story is brought upon us. It is rather boring on her part as her character isn't in the least interesting. I'm sure the writers could have thought of something completely different for a second act than how it turned out. Overall, since the film is quite a different superhero type film, it has its moments.",6,0,2,17 January 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Good visuals lack of story
","As with the most of these monster King Kong or Godzilla films, the main interest is in regards to the special effects, and visuals and the story or its characters are the least concern. Although this movie has great visuals, well scenery and Kong looks visually stunning, it's story or most of its main characters just aren't interesting enough.Tom Hiddleston is a solid actor but he's dull as a leading action hero. Samuel L. Jackson plays his typical angry character and Brie Larson is okay. Though it's John C. Riley's character who steals the scenes abs comes out most memorable.Some decent action scenes and some nice looking kills from the monsters but not enough excitement or joy. We didn't care much for the lesser characters when they died. With a predictable outcome and a plot that doesn't quite reach its full potential, this movie isn't that great as it could have been. Perhaps it was too watered down and family friendly.",5,1,2,21 July 2019
Hitch," Wonderful Movie
","So I decide to watch this movie on TV and I guess I liked this. Will Smith does not do anything slow. It is always right on target with the greatest scripts and comedy that keeps you laughing, and involved in the plot. You are watching a skilled comedian, who plays all his parts well. One fully believes he is who he is playing. The start of this movie is real funny with great jokes. Will Smith and Kevin James have great chemistry in this and it works out nicely. Although Eva Mendes character was really rude and snotty, but she was looking great (plus side. I didn't understand why she was getting so mad at Hitch towards the end, something real weird and confusing.Will Smith seems to have honed his comedy routine well. He was funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled up, and he looked more like some kind of gargle. Then seeing him sipping on the benadryl bottle trying to bring his head back down to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us all laugh. Also laughed at Kevin James scenes, he really stole the show (in a good way you f**king dumbases) Id recommend this movie, its great to see. 
==
As a rewatch 08/06/18' over 8 years, Hitch remains a very solid and great stepping stone for Will Smith to show his acting skills. As a result, Hitch was Will Smith at top form, which is a shame considering how his career has went slightly down hill these last few years.",7,0,0,2 January 2010
Shooter," Entertaining and Thrilling
","Shooter starring Mark Wahlberg is an action, crime thriller director by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day). Many may seem to think that this film is all about three things: guns, motion and guns making people move. There are several of targets. The good crop of creeps is led by Danny Glover as an FBI nasty, and Ned Beatty as a U.S. senator. Kate Mara is the leading female with several decent lines where, shew tags along for some action, even gets to dig a bullet out of Swagger. Michael Peña is a decent FBI agent who slips into support like a bonus cartridge. But the film is Wahlberg's.As many have considered, Shooter is for those who enjoy deep critical thinking sniper and brainless action films with a good plot. Many great violence and the cinematography is wonderful. One would include, a big mountain, Swagger virtually diagrams those problems, the shots ringing out. Rewatch 06.14.20'.",7,0,0,24 May 2016
Inception," Mind-blowing complex thriller
","There really isn't much to say about Inception that hasn't been said already. By now, its very well known and considered a really great piece of art (to many a masterpiece). Inception is a very well written, yet confusing action-thriller concerning reality and dreams. Before watching the film, I had some high expectations but also some rather lower expectations. I've read many positive reviews, and negative reviews, so I finally decided to watch the film. And I was very please and my expectations were met.In detail, director Christopher Nolan throws a perfect storm of stunts, effects, locations and actors at one big idea: that it's possible to pilfer ideas from dreams by a process called 'extraction', which involves hooking yourself up to a drip, falling asleep and entering the world of the subconscious. The holy grail of this process is to reverse it, which is 'inception', the planting of a new idea in another's mind. That's the trick that experts Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Levitt), aided by new recruits Ariadne (Ellen Page) and Eames (Tom Hardy), try to pull off while hopping from Tokyo to Paris to Mombasa. They're working for Saito (Ken Watanabe) in pursuit of business magnate Robert (Cillian Murphy), and their motives vary, from financial to intellectual. But DiCaprio has another driver: the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cottilard) is haunting him and it's going to take a lot of psychological spring-cleaning for him to reconnect with that lost world. Overall, Inception is a very well made thriller and should please many for different various reasons. If you haven't already seen Inception, I highly suggest watching it (on DVD or online- letmewatchthis.com) You wont be disappointed. ==================================================================== ====== After a rewatch (03/03/17') Inception remains one of the better and all time great sci-fi thrillers within this decade. Nothing more can be said that hasn't already. From the beginning of the film, we are seeing as to what a great film represents. The writing is complex and great at the same time, making the film understandable yet difficult to understand at certain points. Inception has lived up to the hype since its release and remains one of the cornerstones of modern cinema.",10,1,10,18 January 2011
The Waterboy," Some chuckles but overall not funny
","The Waterboy is one of Adam Sandler's more well known and successful comedy films of the 90's (It was his biggest films up until 2010). This film is mainly directed to his teenage fanbase and in this case, there are several issues and just moronic errors about it. We all understand this film is a comedy but it is far too unrealistic and comes off as just irritating and annoying. Comparing the Waterboy to Happy Gilmore (a much better film) we see him beat up Bob Barker. In The Waterboy, he plays a lisp-speaking, clumsy, little mama's boy whose life has no direction, no purpose, and, apparently, no human intelligence. After he is hired to be the water boy for a crumbling Louisiana football team, a few of the 'star' players enjoy insulting him every chance they get. When he's at the point where he just can't take it anymore, he exclaims 'stop making fun of me,' and head-butts them, sort of like a tackle. What is unrealistic about this is that all it takes for Bobby to make the team and be their star player is one tackle. There are a few chuckles in the movie but after a while we tend to realize how silly overall the film is.Just like it every Sandler comedy, the end product is quite predictable. We ends up succeeding while being the underdog and ends with the love interest. Sandler himself can be funny, but tackling football players because they make fun of him is no amusing. It gets old fast. His mama was funny at first but they kept the gag overdoing itself where he stopped being anything. The Waterboy has not aged well over the years either.",3,1,2,14 February 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Decent but not great
",Secret life of Pets remains a children's animation comedy. The trailers looked promising and the film was somewhat as expected.

The Good Shepherd," Lengthy and thought provoking
","With a run time at nearly two hours forty five minutes, a lot of story was to be held and taken place. This is a film with different sections and uses flashbacks and several different non linear way of story telling. There is some clever scenes and some scenes of mystery and intrigued but also some scenes that are quite bland and drag on. The story is somewhat interesting but does require much attention to detail.One thing which is quite off is the fact that the story changes in different decades and we see very little change in make up to both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie's characters (as in they look as if they hardly aged 20 years later). Without the subtitle card noting the specific date, this may have confused many people.",7,1,2,9 June 2019
Arrival," Different kind of Sci-fi film
","Arrival has been widely praised for it's visuals, storytelling and performances from its leads Amy Adams and Jeremy Renners. As usual with films that are widely praised from critics, there are its share of audience and movie goers overreacting about how they dislike the film. Arrival is not the typical science fiction film with much action and explosions, and moments of suspense. It does feature great acting and is more of a slower paced drama. It appears people were expecting an 'alien vs humans' battle type film which this isn't. With that being said, after a while of watching the film, it did become to drag on and some parts became quite boring to watch. Those reviews saying 'there is no plot' weren't paying attention and should be avoided. Although the film does not contain much suspense or thrills. The visuals and cinematography do stand out as the film does look great. At the end we are left wondering what exactly was the point. Overall Arrival is a sci-fi alien type film where viewers apparently seem to either love it or hate it.",5,1,2,9 September 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Overpraised Hype
","Birdman is a one of a kind film which has received amounts of hype last year regarding it's Oscar wins and nominations. It's a film littered with passably amusing industry in-jokes designed to appeal only to middle-aged failures – which may explain why critics are so in love with it. Birdman stars Michael Keaton, who once starred as Batman, is pretty much playing himself, as is Norton who's known as a notoriously difficult actor to work with. There are also some amusing, or glib, remarks about social media, the cluelessness of critics and our obsession with superhero movies. Meanwhile, the director shows off by making the entire film look as if it was shot in one enormous take.",3,4,8,6 October 2015
The Big Short," Confusing at times but comes with Suspense
","The Big Short which then kicks off with a prologue detailing the invention of the mortgage backed securities that, decades later, would destroy the economy, the film proceeds to intertwine three stories from the mid-2000s of Wall Street outsiders who didn't buy into the fallacy that the housing market couldn't fail. Director Adam McKay has an odious investment banker, played by Ryan Gosling, narrate their stories. Gosling's character, Jared Vennett, works for a bank but, crucially, he doesn't think like a bank. Indeed, in a sign of how definite the industry is he's openly working against employers.Throughout the film, we first see which is Christian Bale's anti- social, money manager Michael Burry. He's the first to actively convince head-in-the-sand investment banks to sell him insurance bonds against subprime mortgages going bad. The banks think he's a joke, but they're happy to take his money and it's not long before a combination of rumors and happenstance alerts Vennett and Steve Carell's outraged hedge-fund manager Michael Baum.Overall the directing and chemistry amongst the leads works, but at times the film does differ and suffer at times, which causes confusion and becomes quite overstated.",7,0,0,4 August 2016
Never Back Down," Solid Movie
","Never Back Down knows where it is to cover, and knows its audience. All of this eventually leads up to the big showdown in an underground tournament that just so happens to take place at one of Orlando's hottest night clubs.The fight scenes themselves are energetic and impressive, especially considering the cast involved. The film could have been helped by less shaky camera movements during these sequences, but fight choreographer Damon Caro deserves a lot credit for crafting brawls that stay fairly true to the MMA style.Hounsou really stands out as the best thing in the film. both in terms of acting and fighting technique. During his training sequences he displays impressive speed, agility and fluidity. It's too bad we never get to see him in a proper fight scene. The story does have its moments, but for the most part it's a paint-by-the-numbers affair.Never Back Down has been compared to several films which came before it, and for good reasons because it shares many similarities to other films. It takes parts from the Karate Kid, Fight Club, You Got Served, with several other elements from The O.C.Never Back Down is solid for what it is, as it entertains the audience but the storyline is far too predictable, and really not that interesting.
==================
As a rewatch (06/19/18') Never Back Down does what it was intended for and is a satisfying and enjoying watch. Although as mentioned before, the film is filled with many cliches and takes bits and parts from past films, Never Back Down is still quite entertaining.

Prometheus," Visually Stunning and Entertaining
","Prometheus begins on Earth when two scientists (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) make the connection of various hieroglyphics and cave drawings with an ancient visit to this planet by alien beings. A subsequent two-year trip into outer space lands the hibernating crew (Charlize Theron as the captain and Michael Fassbender as a devious robot) on a planet where the human race may have begun. But once the ship Prometheus lands and begins its investigation, well, things just don't seem to go right. From there, various conflicts and emergencies play out, with Scott orchestrating every one for maximum effect. As the film goes, we are treated with a variety of twists and turns. Prometheus contains well shots of scenery and the creature along the way are well designed. The film is well above average simply due to the stunning visuals and the performance of Fassbender.",8,2,6,9 October 2015
Wonder Woman," Star making turn
","Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman was most definitely the highlight of this film. With little to no expectations but having seen overwhelming positive reviews and initially not being too interested in viewing the film. Decided to watch for the first time, and Wonder Woman is better than have anticipated it being. The action is there, the storyline is decent though predictable, it was at least entertaining from a stand point, and didn't take itself too overly serious.The movie is fun overall and even with a lengthy run time, the pacing does deliver properly. As mentioned, Gal Gadot is the highlight and she delivers a star making turn as she instantly elevates the film. Chris Pine is also good in his role. We are now anticipating the sequel expected to be released next year- 2020.",7,1,2,6 May 2019
Despicable Me," Despicable Me delivers with harmless fun, and a few laughs
","I wasn't expected to see this film but decided to watch it anyway since seeing many positive reviews and feedback. The plot seemed a little weird and far-fetched for me, but while watching it, it seemed a little better and rather original. The basic plot outline is: An evil man (Gru) who adopts three small girls just to use them in his evil plot to steal something and then return them to the orphanage after they no longer serve his purpose. A few more details but that's about it.What steals the movie in Despicable Me are the minions. They are the little yellow one-eyed and two-eyed guys you see in the commercials and the trailers. They don't speak English, but that definitely does not lessen their effect. They are fiercely loyal to Gru and they seem to take his experiments in stride. The minions even dress up and head out to a department store in one of the more memorable scenes in the movie.The thing about this movie is that they do not always go for the one-time quick joke. There are several jokes that run throughout the movie, and that work very well. Unlike, Megamid, this comedy doesn't have cheesy and clichéd humour- Despicable Me doesn't try too hard to get laughs. This is an entertaining movie for adults and children, it definitely does not drag itself out as new movies seem to and it is most definitely very, very fluffy. Seeing as they're planning a sequel, I could see it being pretty good and Im interested about what it will be about.",7,0,1,14 January 2011
Marriage Story," Realistic marriage drama
","With much acclaim and hype surrounding this film from critics including several different award nominations. Marriage Story is a Netflix production film and one of its most successful films to date receiving several Grammy nominations.This movie is quite good and realistic portraying a couple going through a divorce dealing with living situations and cooperating time with their child. Part of the acclaim is how realistic the film appears and the dialogue is very sharp, witty and serves a purpose. The characters (specially Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) are very life-like and feel like real people. We could see the emotion in their deliveries as both actors seem heavily invested in their roles. A lot of it had to do with the acting as well as the writing.One thing which have seen much acclaim from is by the apparent tear jerker reactions. Audiences claiming how depressing or how people were overly crying while watching this movie. Do not agree as this movie is far more tame than expected. It is a heavy and serious topic but there are many light moments. Compared to Blue Valentine, which it has received many comparisons to. There are similarities but Blue Valentine feels more depressing, emotionally movie and powerful.As a whole Marriage Story is well good but perhaps slightly over hyped. Although it did make one think about real life issues and different situations upon watching the movie.",8,6,9,19 February 2020
Taken 2," Not as Interesting and flawed
","Taken 2 is the sequel to the successful Taken film, sees a similar rehashed story, though set in a different location. Into the film and for reasons that don't deliver, Bryan (Liam Neeson), daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), and ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) who's facing a divorce from her current husband, are all in Istanbul to have a good time and unwind from the trauma of Kim's kidnapping. Taken 2 appears to take its time getting to the action, dithering away an inordinate amount of time on Lenore's crumbling marriage, her astonishingly good relationship with Bryan, and Bryan's notification that Kim has a boyfriend. The film's action sequences are wide and thin and the camera is noticeably shaky in many of the scenes. The plot isn't too much, nor is it all that interesting. Predictable in the least. Overall, Taken 2 does deliver in some ways but in general, the film is quite boring and not too entertaining. Though it isn't too long, which is a plus.As a rewatch 12/4/18' Taken 2 relies on a very similar atmosphere and tone set in Taken, though this film feels much less without the suspense and overall thrills seen in Taken. We can see as to why the rating for Taken 2 is much less as compared with Taken, as people had high expectations, and were ultimately somewhat letdown. Although, this film does have some very decent moments but action, it isn't on the level of the original. Rating changed from 4 to 6.",6,1,1,30 December 2016
Step Up," wasn't that great but not bad
","I watched this movie but wasn't really expecting to watch it at all. this movie wasn't such a good movie. Before i watched this movie i didn't have high expectations for this movie because many dance movies seem not to be great. So i was right, step up wasn't such a good movie, it was alright and enjoyable at times but wasn't really entertaining. That female main character can't act, it's so fake. The dancing in the movie was nice. The storyline isn't that good neither, it seemed rushed and really weird. There were a few parts of the movie that is confusing...and the setting of this movie is of a high school...its stupid, the actors CLEARLY look like they're in their 20's. They should have switched that and just make them college/university students. There was also some funny parts that I enjoyed like when Channing (Tyler) was goofing with his friends, and how he acted towards the female. I was a little surprised that there were some serious drama scenes that should not have been included (ex. Tyler's friend's little brother murder scene- really bad to show, made no sense) Overall, I think this movie is pretty decent for people that enjoy dance movies and are fans of Channing Tatum..so Id recommend it",5,0,1,7 February 2010
X-Men: First Class," Successful start of the franchise
","X-Men: First Class is the first film of the X-Men series that we seen start which released few more sequels. This film tells the origin story of how the superheroes became what they were and shows how it all started. The film is fast paced but at times slows down to show the in depth details of each character. Of all the things that went right with this film, was casting of James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender as the young versions Patrick Stewart's Xavier and Ian McKellen's Magneto respectively. Bringing the dramatic polish they honed on such films as Atonement and Hunger, they give soul and believability to what could otherwise have been a tragic, worthless repeat of the empty. Overall First Class was a successful and engaging start to a successful franchise which has grown over the years.",7,0,0,15 October 2017
The Wolverine," Delivers on Action and Suspense
","The Wolverine (2013) is the sequel to the disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). The movie picks up some time after the events of X- Men: The Last Stand, and Wolverine has gone to live alone in the wilds of Canada, consumed with guilt after being forced to kill Jean Grey. He has promised to never hurt anyone else, but when local hunters poison a grizzly bear we see that he's barely able to keep that vow. Which is all good because a mysterious Japanese girl arrives in town and whisks him away to Tokyo, where he is reunited with a Japanese prison guard he rescued from the Nagasaki A-bomb explosion decades before.That guard has become the most powerful and richest man in Japan, and now he is dying. He wants to thank Wolverine for saving him that day, but he also wants something else. He knows of Wolverine's secret powers, and over the last few decades he has been working on a system that will allow him to take Logan's healing factor for himself. The man, Yashida, can live forever and Wolverine will finally be given the sweet release of death. We are full aware as to what has happened and are patiently awaiting it's third film from this franchise.",7,1,1,26 January 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Great conclusion trilogy
","The Dark Knight is set eight years after the events occurred in the Dark Knight. Bruce Wayne has retreated to the rebuilt Wayne Manor where he has pulled into a Howard Hughes shell. When a shapely cat- burglar (Anne Hathaway) poses as the help and makes off with his mother's pearls, Wayne is inspired to venture out and investigate this woman. Meanwhile Gotham has all but eliminated organized crime in the city through the dictatorial methods permitted under a law passed in honor of Harvey Dent.Now we see where Bane (Tom Hardy) comes into place, who decides to turn Gotham on its ear and release the prisoners to teach everyone the lesson that Ra's Al Ghul promised in the first film. Overall the Dark Knight Rises is filled with action, suspense, great characters and performances, and entertainment. Although slightly not on the level of the Dark Knight, this film delivers where is matters and is a very great concluding film to a great trilogy. As a rewatch 03/18/20' the Dark Knight Rises is well quite lengthy but contains much detail and has much going well for it. Opinions remain relatively same. Very well way to conclude this franchise.",9,0,2,28 May 2017
Black Panther," Not as interest
","Having seen the overwhelming critic reviews and overall success and accolades that this film has received, the hype for this Black Panther film was at a height that rarely many superhero films (even films of any genre)have amassed.This film is visually stunning, with great direction, and overall acting. Likable rooting characters but in general, there was a lack of interest. The story line felt as if we have seen before. The plot isn't quite as refreshing or unique as originally thought, and at times was somewhat boring.We can see as to how and why many people have considered this film to be overrated and not nearly as great as its critics are founding over. Perhaps this is one of those films where we need to have interest in the culture and overall character landmark to fully feel connected. In the end, one was left disappointed.",6,1,3,5 April 2019
Iron Man," It was really well done
","I found Iron Man to be very great and surprisingly entertaining. The beginning was pretty boring in a way but it picked up the pace and everything fell in its place, this movie was real good. The special effects they used and the cool stunts were really cool. Robert Downey Jr did a great job as Iron Man, along with the other characters. This movie has a great plot and it turned out real good. I didn't think that it was gonna be this good but I was pretty much surprised. Even though they're were a lot of talking in the beginning half, the action picked up the movie great in the second half. I love the Iron Man suit, the high-tech devices and all the technical things about it.Great Job, cant wait for Iron Man 2",8,0,1,29 January 2009
Mother!," Bizarre and story lacking
","Mother! written and directed by Darren Aronofsky is a rather less than self indulgent art designed piece. The first half is surprising and rather good as watchable although we are wondering what the film is about and what's going on but the second half (around when 'mother' becomes pregnant) is a chaotic, indulgent and eventually rather disgusting mess.Aronofksy unsettles us from the start with a shot of a woman apparently burning to death. Then he dazzles us as a derelict house is brought almost magically back to life before our eyes.It is here than an unnamed young woman (Jennifer Lawrence) lives with her significantly older husband (Javier Bardem). Their agreed division of labour is that she will restore the house while he writes. But he's blocked and can't write a word. Their idyllic-looking relationship in this idyllic-looking house is beginning to crumble.Mother! is a strange film but things apparently just happen without any plot or sort of reason. First people barge into the house where we see Jennifer Lawrence's character having any sense and wanting them to leave, but Javier Bardem's character thinking that everyone who enters are fans of his (as they mention he is a big 'writer/poet' of some sort) as he seems to be more of a push over and doesn't care that people (especially towards the end) are destroying his house. What made little sense and was bothersome is the lack of names. What we don't get is why no one asked for their names.Mother! isn't as deep or bold as some claim, at parts it is quite unique and watchable to see chaos happen but in the end, we are left with wondering as to what the point was. Also featured a lot of close ups with clear camera focus, especially towards their facials.",4,0,0,24 June 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Over the top and lack of suspense
","As big summer blockbusters come, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was one of the more anticipated films in recent memory. Having being years for its wait, the anticipation leading up to its releas was relatively heavy. Overall the film is a dissappoinytment on many levels, as by now fans and critics have pointed out. It feels like too much of a long film. Apart from featuring approximately the numerous screen incarnation of the murder of Wayne's parents, it does mercifully away with most of Batman's origin story, as it was done better in Batman Begins. Batman v Superman feels at most times overall boring and lacking of suspense of any thrills. The characters don't seem as much into it, as should have been. Superman as a character lacks any energy as Henry Cavil seems to be on audio pilot. Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne is decent, though his portrayal and voice as Batman is what ruins it. Christian Bale did a much better portray as those Christopher Nolan Batman films were overall more constructed with better writing, directing and overall structure. Jesse Eisenberg was miscast as Lex Luthor as his tone is far too over the top compared to the other characters. We understand the character is a crazy villain, but it doesn't work well here. As for success, this film as a success as expected, though general speaking it is a bad/disappointed as it has been claimed. The visuals and some fight scenes were decent but just did not have much of an impact.",4,0,6,3 March 2018

Having high expectations, the film is somewhat over hyped and not nearly as entertaining or great as expected.Considered released in 1982, many have claimed as the filmed to be ahead of its time. Blade Runner is very stylish (for a filmed released in the 1980's) but one feels that it is more style over substance. It's overall plot is confusing and the characters aren't too interesting.There is very little action and the pacing is quite slow. It does have a slow build and does get better in the second half but overall, Blade Runner is a letdown and doesn't see the worth hype. Perhaps the film is better on a second viewing with more attention to detail.",5,4,9,24 January 2019

Toy Story 3," Great third version of a successful series!
","I've decided to watch toy story 3 because i was a fan of the previous two toy stories and I thought those were really well done and had great stories. Toy Story 3 proves that the third film of a series does not have to be the weakest and that it can sometimes even be the strongest. Toy Story 3 is just as magical as the first two offerings and the quality of the animation is second to none. Now I don't necessarily remember exactly what happens in the previous two toy stories but I remember liking them a lot and how the stories were great. I feel that Toy Story 3 is the best out of the 3. Toy Story was great but the third one does it the best, in my opinion.All the same toys are back but this time their are new toys (some good, some bad). Unlike the previous toy stories, this one is filled with more frightening scenes and more mature themes. This one is also more darker and some scenes can scare little kids slightly, but that's what makes it great. I was surprised that their were some scenes like that, after reading some comments from critics and reviews. This movie isn't really for young children but it all depends on their views. The finals scene was a great way to end the series and movie Overall Toy Story 3 is a fantastic film filled with magic moments, strong characters and visuals that only Pixar can produce. Amazing job",9,2,2,10 August 2010

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Well cast and scenery succeeds
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona possesses an energy, an intelligence and most of all, a passion that hasn't been seen from Allen in years. Gratefully, the filmmaker completely avoids making either of his actresses stand-ins or proxies for himself as he has done in the past, allowing Johansson and Hall to find the truth and humanity within their characters without forcing them to subscribe to some neurotic shtick, much less any of his other Allen-heroine clichés. Best of all, he crafts a completely believable portrait of each woman's uncertainty and in the process creates an interesting cross-section of romantic ideals between Vicky and Cristina's opposite perspectives.",7,0,0,29 December 2015
Speed," Solidifies as an entertaining action thriller
","Starting right off, Speed engages and becomes a thrilling and entertaining film from one of the opening scene (with the workers on the elevator) then fast forward some time later, we get to our main plot, of a bomb on a runaway bus. Starring Keanu Reeves, in one of his biggest roles, and a lesser known Sandra Bullock, this film delivers in terms of action, suspense and overall excitement. With likable leads, great stunts, not forced romance and an entertaining and not completely over the top villain, we can see as to why Speed is as high praised as it is.Watching for the first time this year, this film doesn't feel as outdated as many other great or classic films of the 1990's. Highly recommend for those who have yet to see this movie.",9,1,1,29 June 2019
Live Free or Die Hard," Different take on Die Hard
","Live Free or Die Hard has received quite good praise from most critics and fans were excited yet worried how the new film would be. Since it has been over 12 years since the previous instalment, and now given a new PG-13 rating.Well into the film and much like the previous Die Hard films logic isn't exactly a part of the game, but sheer adrenaline packed excitement sure is. John McClane is faced with many outrageous challenges and like before he doesn't back down. Much of the 'controversy' on the forums here was about the PG-13 rating's limited profanity.Die Hard 4 is different but also quite satisfying for an action film. Recommend for those fans of the series. As a rewatch 08/08/19' Live free or Die Hard remains a very entertaining action film.",7,2,2,23 December 2018
X2: X-Men United," Bigger and Better than the Original
","X2 is an all around bigger and more explosive version of its processor the original X-Men. First, X2 is longer and includes more characters (such as Nightcrawler- who steals his scenes and Pyro- used for some comic relief) which gives them more screen time and is able to create more chemistry and more dimensions for the other mutants. The cast is also more familiar and the bonds are great. The action and overall plot is more enjoyable and entertaining, including more emotion and suspense throughout. We see more details brought in and more explanations about Wolverine's DNA and origin about his claws and genetics. Also Rogue (Anna Paquin) is less of a focus which works better and her acting has improved. Left with an ending that was an another clear cut sequel ending, the studios and everyone involved had knew this film would become a hit safe keeping a sequel (which was 2006's The Last Stand). Another thing which is an improvement in X2 is the overall character of Wolverine, he's still there talking but now we see more action scenes from him (this time around using his claws more in action and actually killing enemies). Less campy scenes and one liner dialogues including for comedic relief as well. X2 is overall a well directed, acted and thoroughly entertaining film which delivers what is was supposed to do.",9,1,1,3 December 2017
Lucy," Exceeds Entertainment
","The first two acts, however, are compelling and find Lucy playing out the scenario Norman describes, escaping from — and later eluding — the mobsters, first with a gun, then with nothing other than her rapidly increasing brainpower. Johansson plays Lucy's transformation as believably as possible, starting as a hysterical mess and becoming cold, detached, something beyond human, almost robotic as her enhanced capacity takes her far past the capabilities of anyone else. Examining the toll it takes on Lucy allows us, for a time at least, to forget that it's all basically hogwash. Lucy wants to be a cerebral movie, but its smarts, if you want to call them that, haven't the slightest basis in reality and are, along with the budget, outweighed by Besson's overreaching ambition. The director is at his best crafting an action set piece — and he gives us a few of them here — though what Lucy eventually becomes capable of makes the death and destruction left in her wake, including a lengthy shootout between Parisian police and Taiwanese mobsters, seem trivial.",8,10,23,17 October 2014
The Sixth Sense," Supernatural tale with some Intensity
","After many years, The Sixth Sense remains the film which gave M. Night Shyamalan his high praise and is considered by many to be his best film. The film bills itself as a psychological thriller, but it's really more of a supernatural adventure picture that will make you ponder and think about every little detail of your own life once after watching the film. Bruce Willis stars as a child psychologist trying to heal a young boy (Haley Joel Osment). The boy's affliction, he's always scared. And he has good reason to be.After several close paying attention to detail, though this synopsis is quite brief, more said would mean fewer surprises. And this is one film sure to surprise you. Rather, let's turn our attention to the horror factor. This film is not a horror film in the least, as there are no slashing and no scary pop-up scenes. Instead, it's the relationship between the psychologist and the boy that aptly carries the picture, that and the subjects of the child's 'sixth sense.'For one time viewers to watch this film as of 2017, it may feel as scary to those who have watched the film in its 1999 release date. Overall, the Sixth Sense plays great mind tricks but as a horror film, it is not. More so a mystery thriller with occasional jump scares (though are very brief)",8,0,2,27 January 2017
RED," Halfway between comedy and action but doesn't quite work well as either
","Red isn't as great as the positive reviews its been getting. Its really not that funny in the comedy part and the action scenes aren't that impressive. Some cool fight scenes but not that many. The scenes have been done many times before and have done better. With a talented cast, I expected the film to be much better, and I was disappointed. The main problem with the film is that it tried too hard to be hip but fails considering the age's of the main cast. There were many jokes and gags that failed and that simply were not funny. The romance was also cheesy.The characters weren't that great. Though the only saving grace here is John Malkovich, who steals every scene and is really quite funny. Same with Mary-Louise Parker, she performed well and was the most intriguing and careful character IMO. Bruce Willis as Frank is, well Willis, not a stretch- seen him done the same role a few times now. The negatives are Helen Mirren, though looks excellent for her age, doesn't make her role feel realistic enough (she's 65 firing machine guns/cursing), it seemed too fake and her attitude was really annoying. In the third act when she becomes a presence the film goes downhill. Morgan Freeman is really criminally underused, and Karl Urban is quite talented and is becoming very versatile but wasn't that convincing as the lead villain. All in all, don't expect anything original, or good. It's not terrible, just below average, and should have been much better.",3,15,34,15 October 2010
Final Destination," Original sets the path for the franchise
","Final Destination has been a successful and known horror-thriller franchise. Starting with the original film, released in 2000, which may have been a modest decent hit domestically, warranting it a sequel. Having originaly seen Final Destination several years ago (around 2012), much have been lost and forgotten about this film, though several small details have been remembered,Final Destination is quite a thrilling and suspenseful film, although at times has some cheesy teen humor (which may be expected given its target audience). As a rewatch 12/09/18', the film is as good and enjoyable as remembered. The cast plays well as we can see the suspense and thrills coming. Overall, Final Destination is quite a solid film, which may be worth another watch. As another rewatch 03/11/20' the film holds well and remains a good watch.",7,0,1,11 December 2018
The Purge," Has its potential moments
","Having heard about these Purge films but never been too interested in them, decided to watch the original to see how it was. As was expected but slightly different. This film is more of a thriller than horror and it works in some ways.The film is quite short so everything happens roughly quickly. Ethan Hawke is a likeable lead character here, and so is Lena Headey but the two kids weren't and made questionable choices from the start. First when the actual Purge begins, the son lets in a stranger he sees out in the street. Had he not done this, perhaps everything that occurred would have been avoided.As an action thriller there are some decent amounts of thrills and entertainment. It is as to expect as the trailers do show exactly what it is. And as a lower budget film, this was a massive success which is why it produced three more sequels (as of now). The film could have been better and kore explained but given its run time, its clear they wanted something very quick and to the point.",6,1,1,18 September 2019
The Matrix," Great Sci-Fi effects can create a classic
","The Matrix (1999) is basically the idea of The Matrix, an ultra- computerized sci-fi film by Andy and Larry Wachowski that has an excellent concept but squanders it by falling back on the same old tired action movie conventions. The Wachowski siblings have given us an hour's worth of excellent cinema, filled with fascinating ideas. The film begins where We start with a woman named Trinity (Carrie- Anne Moss), who seems to be on the run from a gang of Men In Black- types led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Luckily, she can leap tall buildings in a single bound, run around on the walls, and so on. So she gets away, but not before contacting a computer hacker named Neo (Reeves) by sending him a cryptic message on his monitor. Following her directions, Neo meets up with Morpheus (Fishburne), who is in charge of a ragtag team of humans from the late 22nd century. And why did Morpheus seek out Neo and bring him up to speed? Because Neo is The One; he's the messiah. He's going to save us all.",8,2,3,11 January 2016
Godzilla," Expected More
","Did not see the massive overly hype from Godzilla as the fans did not expect. The failure to coherently tie-in the nuclear allegory literally kills the film from the get go. The audience is treated to a vague flashback to a Fukushima-like event which sparks a series of events that ultimately leads Joe Brody (Brian Cranston) to set off on his own personal quest to find answers to these mysterious questions that had huge ramifications on his own family as well. The problem here - despite some interesting references to the 'truth' behind a series of Eisenhower-era atomic tests in the Pacfic - over time, there never really is any clear link between the nuclear story and the evolution of Godzilla and other similar monsters.Towards the conclusion of the film we're treated to hours of human interaction that is poorly developed. Audiences are introduced to an endless series of new characters such as Joe's son, Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson - in a performance that was as vague and boring as most of the film), his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and Admiral Stenz (David Strathairn - clearly just collecting a paycheck) - and yet it's hard to care about any of them. All this because any time we get a glimpse of their motivations, the movie swings to the next ludicrous crisis and the actors are left to fill brain dead roles in yet another Hollywood disaster movie.The expectations for several monster love fans for the film can differ however, what we witnessed was something that could have been fixed perhaps with a better more interesting script.",4,4,6,3 March 2015
Looper," Creative Sci-Fi Film That Falls Short towards the End
","Looper was an entertaining, stylish film and was creative and original. I very much so enjoyed the first part of the movie. It was refreshing, and a breath of fresh air. We see how Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lives, what he does for a living, him telling us about the future, and the explanation of Looper and loops are brought to us. It was a really interesting premise of how they would kill off future gang members in order to keep their present under control.The first half was filled with action, sci-fi entertainment, stylish use of loopers, others characters demonstrating the use of loopers as well, and an overall great pace. We then see how the film drastically changes it's genre once we see Joe escape into a cane field (about 50 minutes in). A few scene later, we see a lady (Emily Blunt) outside her house with her shotgun preparing to attack whomever or whatever is hiding in her fields. Her introduction was very solid put then as the film goes on we see her be a major factor in the film. From an action, sci-fi film, the second half settles into a drama with occasional action scenes (provided by older Joe- Bruce Willis wanting to hunt down the 'Rainmaker' in order for his wife to have lived in his future). I thought this part of the film was well done as we were still interested in what Willis was doing.I feel that the entire part involving Emily Blunt slightly dragged a little too much. We then get introduced to her child (Cid) whom is a very out going kid that wants to know all of his surroundings. Then we eventually see him interact with Joe and around this scene is where the film starts its fall. Cid's presence was more into the film and it became quite silly. We then learn that he is not actually the child of the mother but adopted and was kept secret by Sara (from a discussing involving Cid and Joe at night around the table) and that he has telekinesis. We also get more clear as it becomes more evident that he is indeed the 'Rainmaker' which Older Joe is looking for. As this happens, we see Older Joe hunting down kids and killing them thinks are the 'Rainmaker'. He kills off two kids believing at the time they were the 'Rainmaker' but he quickly notices they were not (they were three possible options so this brightens his eye's as he is the only possible one left). Fast forward to the last few scenes, Sara and Cid are escaping from their home in danger and we see Older Joe in the open road shooting fire on them inside their vehicle. As Older Joe continues his fire upon the vehicle, Cid gets scared/nervous and has a sudden outrage which he accidentally uses his telekinesis which flips their vehicle in the air crashing causing them both in pain. Then as they get up they both head towards the cane field where Older Joe see them, approaches and starts shooting. As the shots gets fired, Cid is then using his telekinesis powers and molds a large tornado wind which floats Sara and Older Joe into the air. Suddenely Joe (JGL) while driving along the path, hears gunshots, gets out while the vehicle has been flipped by the telekinesis sees them as he sees that Older Joe in in striking force of shooting Sara. I found this entire scene to be somewhat rushed as it was not executed greatly. Last couple scene, we in fact do see Older Joe shoot and kill Sara while Cid has escaped in the cane field. As of course, this did not actually happen, but was a thought or flash in Joe's head what would have occurred. Which does happen in actuality is Joe still being stunned by Older Joe about to aim fire, Joe then takes his shotgun and decides to shoot himself in the chest killing himself which causes Older Joe to suddenly vanish. I really thought this was a poor way to end the film as the protagonist kills himself in order for Sara and Cid to survive. An alternate ending where he survives and does not kill himself I think would have faired better. Looper was a great film but has its share of flaws. People have compared it to Inception which makes sense although, Inception was executed better and it's story was more interesting as well as more characters to become invested in. Looper stands out because it did not take itself too serious from other mindless action sci-fi films. The R rating really made the film better as it was more mature wise and the violence helped in its parts. Another notable scene in Looper is the diner scene at the local restaurant where we finally see Joe and Older Joe confront each other in which they talk about few things then Older Joe tells him that he is him from the future (this scene makes it more clear for the finale). That entire scene was well thought and entertainingly done. Overall Looper is a well entertaining thought provoking film which makes you guessing and thinking. ==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch (03/03/17'), Looper is well crafted and thoughtful. The action scenes and script within its writing is clever and also yet confusing. While watching, it is important in having a full understanding of the concept to enjoy the film for the better. With time travel films in general, it is quite completely and this film manages a different technique in which we are not used to seeing, which is why Looper stands out. The finale and final scene could have been done different but we can see why the writers ended as such. Rewatching 08 03 17' for another viewings, rarely do we see sci-fi films as Looper in today's age.",7,1,4,6 November 2013
Life," Intriguing but lacking
","Life appears to be a film which went under the radar due to its release. It was not much of a success at the box office. Overall Life is quite decent and intriguing but as a feel that it ins't completely original and is more of a typical space/alien film in which we have seen before. Though it does provide decent entertainment and interest with several thrills. The film is rated R for its violence which is well done, and some occasional language.",6,0,1,25 October 2017
50_50," Interesting Take
","50/50 (2011) is a different take of a serious drama (with mixed comedic elements) from Seth Rogen. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is heartbreaking yet understated as twenty-something cancer sufferer Adam, though at many times his character comes off as completely unlikable which makes it hard to root for him.Though within the film, Seth Rogen's as the best friend Kyle steals majority of the film with his typical wise cracks and Seth Rogen type humor. I can understand many people disliking his character but there is a certain charm to it, and his character elevates the film. 50/50 has been praised for its serious topic surrounding cancer and the method in which the film goes about it. Although the film is predictable (in the end), it is quite an interesting take.",7,0,0,19 February 2017
Deadpool," Lives up to the hype
","Deadpool has been much talk of the 2016 calendar year. Since the film became a huge success at the box office and was critically acclaimed through several critics throughout. Deadpool in spite, is a super-powered revenge-seeker who, like many superheroes, is quick with the wisecracks. However, what makes this film stand out is its obvious hard R-rating- they let Reynolds make a ton a unnecessary and profane jokes throughout, though it works and many of the gags and one- liners we hear are quite clever and makes for great entertainment. Ryan Reynolds really makes quite a turn as Deadpool- one of his passion projects he had for years, but is now finally coming to fruition. Besides, the lead character, the supporting characters bring energy to the film and are great in watching.The fourth wall breaking is part of the film's uniqueness, which is something we have rarely seen in superhero films. And in Deadpool, it really does add another great layer. The film isn't too long which works out great because it doesn't feel like it drags at anyone point (compared to the typical superhero film in today's age- which are usually always over two hours long. Deadpool has been compared to Kick-Ass and in some ways to Hancock (2008 film starring Will Smith), however, as an overall film- Deadpool is greater. As a second time around watching 02/25/17' this film gets better, the jokes are are clever and the fourth wall breaking is what makes Deadpool stand out. Looking forward to the sequel.",10,3,9,29 December 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Surprisingly funny spin-off
","I wasn't that big of a fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall but I was seemingly interesting in seeing how this film would be. I recently watched this film and thought it was great and very funny at many scenes. Though, its humour in this is more dirty and raunchy compared to the smart, clever, and witty humour seen in Sarah Marshall. There are enough classic scenes in this film to make me want to go back and see it for a second, third or even fourth time. Get Him to the Greek pushes every envelope in the comedy world. From crazy sexual jokes to drug jokes, this movie has it all. What's hilarious though is that considering how raunchy the film is, there is a ton of heart as well. That is exactly how Judd Apatow films always work out. Now, Apatow did not direct the film but he was the main producer and it has his style all over it.Sean 'Diddy' Combs absolutely stole this movie. Every time he was on screen, he was pretty funny. I am sure it had a lot to do with the writing but his delivery was perfect. It was if he saw Dave Chappelle show episodes that made fun of him and he embraced that by using that to his advantage in this film. He was just as funny as the film's leading stars! In my opinion, Russell Brand and Jonah Hill need to make more movies together. Neither of them outshines the other. All of their jokes were perfectly balanced out and every time they were on screen, the jokes were flowing perfectly. This is one of those rare comedies that is consistently funny throughout the entire film. Though there seemed to be some downhill in the film toward the third act but it went back up again and caught back its funny sense. The film had many great moments but many awkward and weird moments. Overall it was a surprisingly funny film.",8,1,5,21 September 2010
300," Different take on
","300 is adaptation of the Frank Miller graphic novel which is indeed ferocious enough to satisfy those with with its gore, violence and chest-pounding machismo while savvy enough to downplay the homoeroticism that will ever-so-subtly cause heretofore unexplained stirrings in the loins of these same armchair warriors. Yet for all its brutality. Beyond its demographic-targeting, however, its greatest claim to fame is that it's positioning itself as the next step on the evolutionary CGI ladder, offering, 'a true experience unlike anything you've ever seen before.'After all this years have passed, 300 still manages to make impressions of newcomers.",6,1,2,2 January 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Entertaining with great twists
","Kingsman: The Secret Service with one call as Estate Eggsy (Taron Egerton) calls in a favor from Harry Hart (Colin Firth), an old associate of his father. Hart initiates Eggsy into the Kingsman, a privately operated secret service and, in the course of his training, they both run afoul of evil billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who, of course, has a nefarious scheme that needs thwarting.The film has one subtitle too many, and it takes that approach to everything: excess in moderation. Its attention to detail is impressive without being overly meta: only Hart and Valentine acknowledge their debt to classic Bond films, and nobody feels the need to comment on the overkill of an evil lair that seems like it could have been airlifted straight from You Only Live Twice.",7,4,7,31 January 2016
The Hangover Part III," Disappointing Finale
","The Hangover Part 3 tells the story with the original crew returning but with a far different outcome and end results. Taking more of the leading role would be Alan, and it is clear from the start. The Hangover Part 3 essentially is more focused on his story- since it first revolves around him needing to seek help. While the original quartet are all present and correct, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the screen is overexposed to their nemesis Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), the dead-eyed, fun-loving criminal whose double-cross triggers the plot.John Goodman plays it straight as rival gangster Marshall with the result that the comedy curdles into something rancid. The cocktail of Tarantino violence, James Bond stunts and Farrelly brothers humor combines like mud, marshmallows and broken glass.Lensed like a widescreen epic with extravagant vistas of Arizona desert, forests of wind turbines and the glittering neon cityscape of Las Vegas, it looks like a Tony Scott movie. Unfortunately it sounds like a film made by a bunch of adolescent, self-congratulatory movie nerds after a drunken night.The script itself is the real hangover. There is an honorable tradition of disreputable behavior in cinema involving the consumption of alcohol. We are lead to believe that since the creators/writers/crew of the film have heard all of the criticism about its second installment being too similar to the original, they decided to change its pace and try a different approach for The Hangover Part 3. What we have here is a film that has lost its touch and we are left with a non-comedy, with several decent actin sequences.",4,0,1,23 December 2014
Easy A," Easy A tries too hard to be liked
","Easy is a pretty simple straight forward story with an odd message. The plot is rather awkward and weird but for the most parts is plays out. Right from the start the film reeks a bit of desperation, as if it's trying too hard to be liked, much like many of its characters. Olive's feature-length confession, a 4th-wall breaking running monologue, is an awkward device that never seems sincere, while the turns the plot takes, particularly one involving a counsellor and a student, are simply too much to swallow. The film goes downhill in my opinion, from the part where it gets more religious. The scene with Olive going to church. It seemed like that was meant for the original R rating of the film.The characters try hard to be liked but many of them I just don't ended up liking, in particular Olive, her parents (they too hard to be funny), Brandon, and the teacher- Mr. Griffith. Though I did like Amanda Bynes character- she should have been in it more (the best scenes involved her). Easy A is rather shallow and disgusting for a PG-13 film. In my opinion, I think the film would have been better had they kept the film being rated R. The jokes would have been better with a few more swearing and probably more sexual content. The message is obscured by mayhem here as Easy A's moral roots are undercut by its attempts to be one of the cinematic crowd. It just doesn't work for me. Maybe I'm not in the target audience but the film still could had been better. I also felt like they could have added an extra 20 minutes to develop the supporting characters (Rihannon, Marianne, Brandon). Things just felt unfinished and unanswered.",3,13,22,26 November 2010
Fast Five," Delivers on all cylinders
","Being a fan of the Fast and Furious films and having seen the original films since its release, and not having watching this highly anticipated Fast Five. As a whole, Fast Five delivers and is the better than the previous four installments. What makes this film standout, is the group of characters blending from the previous films.They were given an equal amount of screen time and as we seein the end it works out. Also in comparison to Fast & Furious, Fast Five doesn't take itself overly serious and feels like a funner thrill ride from the start to end. The stunts and overall visuals are bigger and better.Dwayne Johnson's character steals his scenes and makes the film instantly better. The fight scene between him and Vin Diesel was worth the hype. Also including the franchises' best chase scene we see in the finale, involving the bank's fault with both Vin and Paul Walker chasing away from the villains, with the help of the other team members.For that final scene alone, is what makes the film worth it and better than the previous four. Not to mention, this time around, the plot is better, more intriguing and with all of that, the film is longer.",10,1,1,4 June 2019
Fantastic Four," it was great
","I love this movie and i loved it more because its not all serious and no fun like other comic book movies. This has a different feel and unique style. Other comic book movies are interesting but a little too depressing and i like the fact that i was able to laugh and just have good time with the fantastic 4 movie. I like the goofy style of the movie and i like the story and plot of the movie. Its unique and cool. My favourite fantastic four character was johnny, he was hella funny and a joker. Susan was also pretty good, i hated Ben, he acted like an idiot and was always mad.I loved the effects and the action to the movie. I like the last scene when all the fantastic 4 fight Victor von doom. The effect looked so nice. I also liked the scene at the beginning when they're at the bridge and see Ben as the thing then they see him saving people from falling off the bridge. They had there power shown a little.Id recommend seeing this movie, its not like other superhero comic movies, this is great...enjoy!As a rewatch 08/13/19' and over ten years after the initial watch in 2009 much opinions have changed. Mainly since there have been many superhero films since initially watching this film. In comparison to this Fantastic Four movie it isn't as good as what we have in today's day. There are some fun parts here but have noticed some flaws. And much of this film doesn't quite stand out.",8,1,2,12 January 2009
Click," very good movie
","This movie really is a good movie and its very entertaining to watch. Click starts out as a comedy then turns into a drama then switches back into a comedy at the end, its great how they combined the two genres. The acting by Adam Sander is great and so is the rest of the cast. The movie has a very special meaning and life lesson.If you're only watching this movie for laughs, you'll love the first 45 minutes then possibly hate the rest. This is definitely one of Adam Sandler's best movie's.Id recommend this movie to a lot of people that enjoy comedies and dramatic movies, its worth watching..very good movie",10,1,2,28 September 2008
Pineapple Express," Seth Rogen and James Franco deliver
","Pineapple Express is a stoner comedy/action movie send-up from the Apatow factory. It starts by Seth Rogen's character witnesses a murder and gets his drug dealer, James Franco, mixed up in the mess. The two go on the run while some gangsters search for them. It's very loose and sloppy, with an improvised feeling. There are long stretches where I didn't laugh much, and there are some plot developments that make little sense. There was a lot of action violence then I expected, but it was pretty good and kept the movie going. Fortunately, much of the film is inspired silliness, and Rogen's and Franco's comic timing is great. Danny McBride and Craig Robinson both give break-out supporting performances, as Red and Matheson. The final sequence in the diner pushes this one for me from pretty good to almost great. Many of the critics who wrote about Pineapple Express went out of their way identifying the elements that belong to him. I also found the second half of the movie to be much better than the first. The part hour was basically Seth Rogen (Dale) explaining and telling James Franco (Sal) about him being in trouble and people after him. The movie gets going towards the middle and really gets interesting at the end. The action towards the end was great. There was a lot of people who got shot and died throughout the movie. And at the end all the bad guys pretty much die, while the three friends Dale, Sal, and Red remain alive. Though it is pretty weird how Red remained alive since being shot many times. Overall, Pineapple Express was a great film from 08 and I enjoyed it.==================================================================== ======== After a rewatch 07/28/17', Pineapple Express remains one of the better stoner comedies of the last decade and since it's release. What makes the film continuous great and watchable are the chemistry between Seth Rogen and James Franco, as well as the dialogue. A lot of clever and witty jokes and quotables in which people enjoy.",8,1,6,21 July 2010
Annihilation," Confusing and ultimately boring
","With a relatively interesting concept, good visuals and a solid cast, this film was anticipated by many prior to its release. Annihilation started off quite decent and unique but as the film progressed ave as more characters came into the picture, it became slightly more off put and confusing.Also relatively boring and not as entertaining or action packed as expected. This film feels as if it tried too hard in being intelligent and smart and the end result resulted in it falling short. A step down from Ex Machina.",3,7,11,22 February 2020
Incredibles 2," Waited too long
","The original Incredibles movie released in 2004 was fresh, exciting and uniquely different from other animated films at the time. Of course now with this sequel being 14 years later, the animation is just as great if not better but the overall film isn't as good and entertaining. Having not remembering too much detail about the original film was remember enjoying it and thinking it was special, this film is a letdown.Not as great action, humor isn't as good and the plot is somewhat bland and has too much of a focus of Elastigrl being the major focus instead of the entire family. Also it is entirely predictable and the basic setup has been done many times before. It was very obvious from the beginning that it was a setup and that either Winston or Evelyn (or both) we're simply using Elestigirl, and that they were the villains. As it turned out it was only Evelyn.The baby having a unique set of powers was a nice touch but that camera little late. Although this film isn't that long (less than 1hr 50mins excluding end credits) it feels as if it drags on.Overall, for a highly anticipated film to have waited 14 years to be released, it was disappointing. The studios waited too long. Given the huge box office success, we hope the third film won't be as long to be released.",5,3,5,24 September 2019
Sin City," Visually Stunning and Well Entertaining
","Sin City (2005) of course is considered one of Robert Rodriguez greatest films, and one of the more well modern pieces of the 2000's decade. Sin City is most certainly not a movie for everyone. This is not the sort of cartoonesque violence that made Kill Bill wild and stylish, rather Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino ('guest director') show a much more darker and grittier world of violence that is dominated in black in white, with only the odd emphasis of color.The entire cast of Sin City really come to the fore, with Owen and Willis in particular standing out and making the gritty neo-30's gangster dialog come to life. The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud Rodriguez for the time he has taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller's novels. The plot is actually 3 stories- all loosely connected with one another. Bruce Willis stars in the first one as Hartigan; a cop whose early retirement plans are cut short due to a combination of his own obsessions with justice and his partner Bob (Michael Madsen); only to find his obsession later on all grown up in the form of Jessica Alba and his nemesis still alive in the form of what can only be described as something seen to be believed. Mickey Rourke in the second story plays Marv, a convict who is determined to get to the bottom of who killed a hooker that spent the night with him. This perhaps sees one of the most interesting performances of the movie in the form of Elijah Wood, who after Frodo Baggins, plays Kevin, a cannibalistic stalker. Finally there's Dwight (Clive Owen) who attempts to help protect the 'sisters' of Old Town led by Gail (Rosario Dawson) from the mob and bent cops.The entire cast of Sin City really come to the fore, with Owen and Willis in particular standing out and making the gritty neo-30's gangster dialog come to life. The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud Rodriguez for the time he has taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller's novels. We have all been long awaiting the heavily anticipated sequel and we are pleased that it will finally be released later this year. ==================================================================== ======= After a rewatch 06/30/17' Sin City remains a very dark, gritty and entertaining stylish watch. The movie is over two hours long but with each story, it flows by very quickly and becomes an overall great watch. The tone of the film remains what stands out, with the actors portraying their parts greatly.",10,1,4,18 August 2014
The Ugly Truth," Rude and offensive not for everyone
",The Ugly Truth is quite a raunchy and more so rude R-rated romantic comedy. The trailers showed the type of film it was set out to be. And seeing several reviews stated how it was offensive and crude must have missed the point. The film is enjoyable at times but also very predictable. There are some decent moments of comedy provided by the cast but overall this movie really isn't anything special.,5,0,0,20 October 2019
Joy," Strong performance excels from Jennifer Lawrence
","Joy may have been considered somewhat of a disappointment and letdown compared to David O'Russell's latest films of these decade. It did not receive as much praise or box office revenue as his other films, as well as Oscar nominations, although the film may be underrated in general (Though Jennifer Lawrence did receive a nomination). Not as a great as Silver Lining Playbook and a completely different film in comparison to the Fighter and American Hustle, though Joy once again delivers a very good movie due to the performance of Jennifer Lawrence. This is a film in where the lead was needed to deliver a strong performance since this is her film as she is in about every scene and she is the complete main focus. It works because she is playing a strong independent role where we are rooting for her, as we see her struggle and everyday chaos at her household. Unlike O'Russell's other films, the story may not be as interesting and entertaining but the more the film goes, the better it becomes and the more we are intrigued in where it is heading. Seeing as it is based on a true story, where a rags to riches tale, the subplots and scenes involving Joy's dysfunctional family are some of the best. The film features Bradley Cooper but in a much smaller role where he isn't in the film for the first half, though once he gets introduced, the film arguably becomes greater as it centers more towards Joy's invention and the stakes it takes in wanting to be great, where the first half was an introduction to her family. Also delivered by a great performance from Robert De Niro as her father, David O'Russell is able to get another solid performance from him. Perhaps something was missing from the film, it is an entertaining watch but in comparison to SLP, it is noticeably weaker.",8,4,10,5 July 2017
Coach Carter," Underrated true story based sports drama
","Coach Carter (2005) appears to be one of Samuel L. Jackson's more overlooked leading roles. This is a film with a firm message which is to take responsibility for yourself and your actions. It's a good message and it's delivered by a solid cast. The main subject is about basketball, but at a run time of over 2 hours, this film dwells into deeper subjects regarding the students of the team. Here we see Sam Jackson star in the titular role as a sporting goods store owner who accepts a job as high school basketball coach at the school where he still holds several basketball records. This film is based on a true story where we are understood that Jackson is portraying a real life figure. The team at the school is filled with raw talent, but no discipline. Carter begins his reign as coach by requiring all of the boys on the team to sign a contract stating that they will maintain a 2.3 GPA, that they will sit in the front row of every class, and that they must wear a coat and tie to school on game days. In return, he promises to guide them to a winning season. After much grumbling, the boys fall in line and begin to accept the Coach, especially after his training methods soon put them on an undefeated winning streak.One thing which is quite hard to grasp at is how quickly Coach Carter was able to turn the team around. It is mentioned early in the film that they were a terrible team the previous year (winning 4 games, with 22 losses), and once Carter comes along, he is instantly able to turn them into a great team (mentioned as winning 16 straight at one point in the film). The challenge seemed quite easier than it should have, where we did not see much struggle. Though in the end, is where the film takes a turn and since it is based on a true story, not everything is a happy ending. The team unfortunately lose their championship game by a very close game. Had this been a fiction film, that most likely would not have happened. Overall, this film is quite interesting though outdated with many of the references and the overall outlook of the film. A great entertaining watch for fans of sports dramas.",7,0,0,16 February 2017
Her," Another Level Different Atmosphere
","'Her' follows Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), an increasingly lonely man whose wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara), has left him. Still clinging onto a relationship that has clearly ended, he refuses to sign their divorce papers. One day, in a desperate attempt to alleviate his loneliness, he decides to purchase an operating system that he can install and speak to, whom he calls Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). As the two speak, he begins to fall in love with her, despite the fact that she's nothing more than a computerized voice. She begins to reciprocate those feelings and finds in her a desire to be alive, which is obviously something she'll never be able to obtain.That's a sad thought, to want something so bad, but know that it will never happen. But it's a beautiful sadness, one that is contemplative and poignant, especially because being alive is all Theo wants too. 'Her' understands that being alive isn't simply in existing, but in the interactions with other people in our lives and the love that grows from those relationships. If we don't have someone to care about or that cares for us, are we really alive?",9,0,1,24 December 2014
The Nice Guys," Stylish and Overlooked
","The Nice Guys is described as a older style neo-noir type drama based upon during the 1970's. This film was released during the summer of 2016 and appeared to have been overshadowed and overlooked due to higher profile films, which is a shame since this film delivers in what people are looking for in these type of stylish crime mystery dramas. Compared to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (by the same director- Shane Black) and there are some similarities but with the Nice Guys, it shows growth from that film.What makes this film work is that the storyline is continuously energetic and entertaining, mainly due to the lead actors of Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowed- their chemistry is what makes this film top notch. The clever and witty dialogue is there as well as the comedy and action. Nothing feels forced and the film does not drag on. Although, it was somewhat odd and different how the daughter was in as many scenes and had a big role as she did (arguably the third most screen time after Gosling and Crowe). Some complained that she ruined the film but one would get used to it. Overall the Nice Guys is one of the better crime dramas of last year, and we have a suspicious this film may develop a type of cult following.",9,0,1,11 November 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Thrilling one of a kind action film
","Mad Max: Fury Road has been overly hyped throughout years since it's released in 2015. For the most part, the hype and overly success from the box office and critical acclaim is warranted. Within the film these are stories that comprise larger legends: avatars emerging from the mists of history now and again and changing everything. In Fury Road, he takes a minute to tell Furiosa his. This is not even mentioning Max, or that the allies Max, Furiosa, and the brides encounter who propel the third act are old women armed with army rifles and bags of seeds. 'That,' says Max, pointing at a naked woman suspended in an open enclosure up in the air, weeping for help, 'is bait.' He gets it. Women are not kittens stuck in trees. The overall action and stunts is what makes Fury Road a unique and one of a kind film. There isn't much though many long car chases.As a rewatch 08/06/17', Mad Max Fury Road remains one of the greater action films of this decade. This film feels better and more entertaining on a second watch. Truly one of the rare films in Hollywood today. It delivers on what it was meant to, and that is entertainment value, incredible stuns and visuals, and great performances by the leads.",9,3,8,11 May 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Based on true events lives up to the hype
","Hacksaw Ridge isn't simply dramatic licence. Directed by Mel Gibson, this film is based very closely on a true story, which is about a conscientious objector who joined the army but refused to fight or even touch a firearm, enduring the scorn and physical bullying of his fellow soldiers before shocking them all with an astonishing feat of bravery during the WWII battle of Okinawa in the summer of 1945. Having no knowledge of the initial true events, one had very little expectations and could not critic based on the reality of the film's depicts. In this respect, the film is very much of two halves. The first is rather quaint, almost like a Hallmark film in its sentimentality. Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is a fervently religious family man and a disappointment to his alcoholic First World War veteran father.Hacksaw Ridge gets better as the film progresses where in the first half, it is more of an introduction to the characters and the motives, then once Doss is enrolled into the war, the energy level and everything appears to elevate. Featuring some of the greater battle scenes in war films, where they did not hold back in some gruesome violence and depiction is another reason as to why this film is as gripping and engaging. Very well directed and stylish looking that it makes it all more than worth the experience. Having received several Oscar nominations, it is understand as to why, especially for best director for Mel Gibson and best leading performance for Andrew Garfeild. Hacksaw Ridge is undoubtedly a very strong film and perhaps a future classic war drama.",9,2,3,21 July 2017
Donnie Darko," Unique mysterious adventure
","Having finally watched Donnie Darko as being a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, and knowing that this film is wildly considered a masterpiece and has been praised and seen cult status. Donnie Darko is a unique film and for this reason is a major part of its praise. At times, it was somewhat confusing (though in a good way) and a plot which we want to see where everything heads.What makes this film good is that there are many different interpretations about its premise and the ending. Such as, was it all a dream? Was Frank (the bunny suit in his hallucinations) and Frank (the guy he shot in the end) the same person? Did Donnie purposely sacrifice himself. A very mysterious and eerie tone sets this film's pace. It's tone somewhat felt like Final Destination in a sense, another very early film released in 2000.Yes, this film is about time travel and it is a major plot, but only really occurs in the second half, as it isn't mentioned in the beginning. One thing which was confusing was how exactly did he time travel, and how exactly did it happen. One can see that this is a film is may require more than one viewing, as there are many little subtle and clever hints along the way. But overall, creative and unique film. Worth a watch, even after all these years.",8,1,3,26 May 2019
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An Improvement over Revenge of the Fallen
","Having not watched this film at the time of its release, and watching the fourth and fifth installment starring Mark Wahlberg before Dark of the Moon, one can see as to why the entire franchise has changed. Dark of the Moon is relatively decent with some entertainment and in comparison to the films with Wahlberg, this one is better. Shia LeBeouf portrays his character better in these films than what we have seen from Mark Wahlberg, as his character and the storylines seem to make more sense.As a film, this does start off decent but becomes tiresome at some points and drags on heavy as these films tend to do. The visuals are there but overall, the film film is still quite messy and the plot becomes distant to its special effects.Megan Fox's replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is decent as her role doesn't require much but is quite odd how the film doesn't mention how her and Shia's character came about. Though, it is what is expected. Dark of the Moon even with its flaws is easily better than Revenge of the Fallen as that was far more messy, too much overload of action with a lesser plot. In this film it settles down somewhat as there is more drama, more heart and at least concise. Not the mention the finale of Dark of the Moon is quite entertaining and heartfelt, knowing it was the end of the main characters.",6,2,2,22 May 2018
The Social Network," Brilliantly written!
","The Social Network was a real fascinating and brilliant film. It isn't just about facebook but more on the founder- Mark Zuckerberg and how he created facebook and the process it went into. In my opinion, the critics got it right, this film is one of the best of 2010 and no doubt should be nominated at the Oscars for best picture, along with David Fincher for best director and Jesse Eisenberg for best lead actor. Right from the start of the film, it sets its tempo with the introduction scene. The film is 2 hours but really didn't feel that long (which is a good thing). The film was vastly entertaining and not boring. And the film is basically a drama about the creation of facebook which includes a lot of talking and the fact that it wasn't boring makes it even more remarkable. One thing that makes the film great is the dialogue. It was very well written and included clever and engaging dialogue.Also, what a liked about the film is that the story is told in a non-linear fashion going back and forth to the start of Facebook and the lawsuits that followed. That really kept the film fresh and keeps the viewers extremely interested throughout. I just loved how Fincher did not warn the audience of the change in time. He lets you figure that out via the dialogue and actions of the characters. The editing was great and fit in well with the movie. Overall the film was brilliant and shouldn't get missed",10,1,2,29 October 2010
The Wedding Singer," Entertaining at parts
","The Wedding Singer is considered one of Adam Sandler's better comedy films and especially of his earlier films of his career. The film is what is to be expected, with Sandler portraying his typical nice lovable guy that ends up winning over the love interest. There are some bits of amusement and entertainment but overall the film is quite predictable and is what is expected. The Wedding Singer is not quite like his earlier comedies, where the comedy is more juvenile, silly and over the top. Which is why many consider this of a more mature film. Overall, the Wedding Singer will bring back nostalgia for many and is another reason as to why it is as praised as it is, though it is quite sappy and not in a good way.",6,2,3,26 October 2017
The Pursuit of Happyness," Will Smith in a 'Never give up' situation strives
","The Pursuit of Happyness is one of Will Smith's more popular and well praised films. He was nominated for a Oscar by the Academy, and despairingly so. Considered one of his greater performances as we see the emotion from his character's face showing range throughout the film. He is an easy character to root for and we see the real life struggles he goes through just to survive with himself and his son.This film is rather touching and has a lot of inspiration scenes and speeches delivered by Smith. It isn't as much of a tearjerker type as initially thought of. Considering we first know the struggles will happen, then ultimately within the end, he will get his big break. Also much more comedic than initially thought as well.The film works great due to the chemistry between Will and his real life son (Jaden Smith). In the beginning we see Will and his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) arguing a lot, and mostly with Linda complaining and throwing unnecessary fits. They really made her character completely unlikable, where she showed no sympathy for Will when he was struggling and then eventually leaving him with his son and little notice about her departure. We understood that he was struggling to pay the bills and rent, and it was mentioned that she was working extra shifts, but it seemed at no point she was wanting to help fix things together.It really felt as if she never wanted to keep the family together, and in the scenes with her and Will, he isn't the one to start many arguments. She lashed out on him for about anything and didn't ever seem ever satisfied or happy. Then once her character leaves for New York for another job opportunity, we do not see her again- which has been for the best.Overall, very good film with touching moments, teachable aspects and a strong message of working hard can lead to success. Recommend if haven't seen already.",8,0,0,12 May 2020
The Bourne Supremacy," An improvement over the original
","The Bourne Supremacy improves over the original as it picks up the pace and becomes more clever and action packed than the original. What it does more in this film than in Identity is seemingly less of a romance and love story, somewhat less talking and Matt Damon as Bourne is more bussiness and appears more comfortable playing the character this time around.The plot is similar to the original but here it feels more quicker pace as things occur right away. Perhaps a shorter run time made it feel better as some unnecessary scenes were cut or shortened. Overall, the Bourne Supremacy doesn't disappoint, as it improves upon the original and is a great action thriller full of twists and suspense.",8,0,0,17 December 2017
The Proposal," Very unrealistic and predictable
","The proposal is another romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock (Margaret Tate) & Ryan Reynolds (Andrew Paxton). As it turns out, so is the pairing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds which seems to be very little 'chemistry' between each other. Individually, Reynolds sarcasm can be amusing, and Bulock's straining for comedy is occasionally funny. However in 'The Proposal' neither brings out anything good in the other, and watching them try being in an awkward relationship hurts the eyes. The nature of the genre, regardless of how it begins, ends with both parties in each other's arms. The film is very unrealistic and predictable. Just the fact that both couple would actually end up falling for each other is odd, there's is clearly a large age difference and it is very noticeable in the film (Bullock is 12 yrs older than Reynolds in real life). Also by predictable it is very basic. At first they are forced to be a couple and really dislike each other but when they go to visit Andrew's parents, they form a bond and eventually start falling for one another. I feel the ending was too clichéd and should have been, that they didn't end up actually getting married. Aside from Reynolds and Bullock the other cast included Reynolds family, Bullock's associate and a male striper (that should have been cut-out-- it wasn't funny at all!). Overall this film is just unfunny, unrealistic and very predictable. It was hard to finish the film because it was dull and boring. Just not my type of movie.",3,2,4,14 September 2010
The Simpsons Movie," The worst movie of 2007, hands down!
","In the past 10 years, I've probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark.It's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie, because there isn't much to say about it.I didn't find anything clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think some of the set designs looked okay. This film is a huge waste of time, don't bother wasting you're money on this garbage. Just avoid this. It's not even worth a rental. If i could rate this movie a 0, i would but IMDb doesn't allow that so I was forced to rate it a 1 star",1,4,7,4 October 2008
Alien: Covenant," Not Prometheus but still solid
","Alien Covenant is the sequel to 2012 hit Prometheus. There was a lot of hype surrounding this film leading to its release and eventually when it was released, a lot of hate surfaced from the original Alien fans. Not being a huge fans of the original Alien movies but enjoying Prometheus, expectations weren't as high as everyone else's.As a film, this does start slow but within 45 minutes or so when the first death occurs, it drastically picks up the pace and becomes engaging. This is a worthy sequel but most hate steams from the fact it isn't on par as the original films.",6,0,1,29 May 2019
Draft Day," For avid Sports fans
","Draft Day (2014) is a film for which is mainly centered for the most avid of sports football fans alike. Being described as a 'sports' film but this is technically not a sports film in that it is more so based on the event of the draft than the actual sport of football. Football is mainly very popular in American and the box office numbers of this film very evidently show that, as this film was non- existent in the foreign market (making less than $1 million). This is a main reason why this film has been considered a box office flop since most of the money it made was domestic, and with a considerable large budget of $25 million it was difficult in making back the money. Had this film had a better outing, it most likely would have been greenlit for a sequel as the ending of the film and overall tone suggested a sequel could have happened.About the film, Draft Day is quality in entertainment and the writing is quite well. Centering on Kevin Coaster, portraying a general manager of the Cleveland Browns (a team with many misfortunes within the last decade plus). Draft Day shows the behind the scenes of how much pressure is on the GM as well as the team in making the right choice to better their football team. It plays out somewhat of a documentary but remains entertaining and intriguing due to well thought out subplots and overall interest of the event. Being better than expected, there was a certain level of drama and intrigued throughout and the results did leave audiences well put. Such as we are engaged in the decisions the GM was to make for their team, even though we are not fans of the particularly team. We wanted to know which player Coaster's character would select in the draft, and it was not as predictable as one though, which is a plus. Another good thing is there wasn't any forced cheesy humor that we see a lot in these type of sports drama, this film kept it authentic and it worked. Memorable quote said by Coaster: 'No one can stop a ticking clock, the great ones always find a way to slow it down.' Overall, since Draft Day did not perform as well as it could have, this film remains for quality avid football fans and is quite underrated at that.",8,0,0,2 July 2017
Dodgeball," very funny movie
","Dodgeball: A True underdog story is a very funny and entertaining movie. Vince Vaughn as Peter LaFleur is great, he isn't that funny but he's a cool-minded and likable guy. Ben Stiller on the other hand as White Goodman is a very funny guy and he's hilarious. He's the 'evil' character in the movie and is the enemy of Peter. The rest of Peter's teammates are funny too, especially Justin and Kate (SEX)this movie is truly a funny comedy to watch, the acting is great and its filled with a lot of slapstick comedy. Its funny how they get hit in the head with the wrenches, lol 'If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball'The end of the movie is really surprising and unpredictable, it has a good flavor and excitement to the film, its a joke all the way around.One if the funniest comedies of that year!!! WOOOOO",10,0,1,4 October 2008
Rock Star," Has its moments but ultimately cliche and predictable
","This film tells a relatively simple story of a young man dreaming of becoming a famous world known rockstar. As played by Mark Wahlberg, the character Chris Cole is the lead singer of a tribute band.Simple concept and interesting idea and eventually somehow he ends up being the lead singer for the band he grew up idolizing.What makes it bizarre is the reason and to how it happened. One day it so happened that Chris had an argument with his tribute band members storming out and vowing to not return, then the following day (or possibly a few days later- it wasn't specified), he receives a phone call from a member of the popular band he idolized.Nothing was shown as to how they got in touch with Chris. It somewhat felt 'too good to be true' or that it was all a joke- which is what Chris initially intended as well. As it turned out, it wasn't a joke and it was the real thing.The premise of Rock Star reminded somewhat to A Star is Born (2018), but if comparing the two, Rock Star pales a lot in comparison from about every aspect.Ultimately the film does start off strong and engaging then about a little more then halfway becomes repetitive and we start to lose focus. Everything becomes quite predictable, tiresome and full of cliches.In the end, Rock Star is a decent film, and preferably those may enjoy it more so if you are a fan of the music or time period, or have nostalgia.",5,0,0,31 May 2020
The Martian," Great combination of Sci-fi and Entertainment
","The Martian starring Matt Damon. He plays Mark Watney. He's a botanist-astronaut on the crew of what appears to be a workaday mission to Mars, one of many on the NASA schedule. Beginning into the film, where we notice when a massive dust storm descends on their operations base and living quarters. In the chaos, a piece of satellite equipment breaks loose, hits Watney and flies off with him attached. Assuming he's dead, the rest of the crew takes off. Though of course he's not dead. But he knows he will be, and soon, unless he figures out how to survive using only the stuff the crew left behind. His mission now is to solve a series of problems.What make the film great is how director Ridley Scott makes use of Damon's character. We see him how he records his efforts on video, which he assumes will be found after his death by the next crew to land on Mars. It's a useful and mostly credible narrative device that allows us to follow Watney's thoughts without the deadly intrusions of voice-over. The film is roughly over two hours and twenty minute long, but it is an exciting ride and the pacing is great. Matt Damon certainly delivers one of his finest performances, which gave him an Oscar nomination. The Martian will most definitely be considered a classic and future classic.",9,1,1,3 July 2016
The Fighter," Inspirational and emotional boxing story
","'The Fighter' works, because it is the story of redemption—for both Mickey and Dickie. The film isn't really much about boxing, yet about Mickey's family problems and personal issues.It is really Bale and Wahlberg's touching screen partnership that brings home The Fighter. And this is balancing of styles and directing brilliance on Russell's part. Bale is raw powerful extremes. Wahlberg is unwavering and rock steady. The Fighter makes you cheer for both. Everyone deserves a second chance, and the chance to be great. The Fighter is less about boxing than this familial conflict, which offers two equally absorbing stories in its first hour. There's Dicky's delusional, drug-induced dream of becoming the 'Pride of Lowell' again and not as a sarcastic punchline, and then there's the dual nature of Mickey, who's a noted brawler in the ring but can't stand up for his own career or say anything slightly critical of anyone in his family for fear of letting them down.Dicky has a documentary film crew following him everywhere, as folks come out of shops on the main street of their declining neighbourhood in the Massachusetts city to wish him well, cheer him on, and, probably most importantly, get on camera. Dicky once held his own with Sugar Ray Leonard (who appears in a cameo as a fight commentator). His claim to fame is that during that fight, Dicky knocked Leonard down, although there are the realists who point out that the champ tripped. Director David O. Russell throws in the footage for us to judge. From his fighting style and a coda at the end featuring the real brothers, one can garner Dicky's brash personality, which Bale captures in a transformative performance, heavy on fast-talking lies or covers but broken by addiction. Overall, the Fighter is a very great film and I'd recommend it to",9,3,6,11 January 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Satisfying revenge thriller
","With a great script and writing this film delivers on thrills and is widely entertaining. Both Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler are enjoyable in their roles. This is more so a Jamie Foxx film but Gerard Butler steals his scenes and is the highlight of the film.Ignore the reviews claiming this film loses its way in the end or the ending is disappointing. They claim this because the bad guy loses (Butler) and his character was entertaining. But this was the proper ending and his character did the crimes, so it was only right to kill him off.Though the ending somewhat felt a little rushed. One small complaint is perhaps they could have added a few more scenes and expanded on the end a little more. Otherwise, Law Abiding Citizen is a very satisfying film.",7,0,0,21 October 2019
V for Vendetta," one of those rare types of movies
","Let me start by saying that this is a great movie, and I think that everyone needs to watch it (assuming the age rights) 'V for Vendetta' has a gripping story line, darkness, and a twisted sort of love story. If you are watching and went 'What?' you wouldn't be alone, but I believe that you have to watch it again in order for the full plot to sink in to the viewer. The story line is based on Guy Fawkes Night. At first I was forced into watching it but I later started liking it more for some reason, its not my usual type of films but it was alright.If you don't know what that is, search it on the internet and you will start to understand the significance of this film. The mysterious 'V' played by Hugo Weaving, is a vigilantly that you never fully get told the back story of. It is a hard plot to summarize without ruining it, because although it takes some twists and turns it really only has one plot line. In the middle of the film there is a twist that will grip you further into V's world. There are also many questions that are left unanswered and lest for the viewer to ponder. I urge you to spend some time and think about the movie so that you can gather your own ideas about why certain things happen in the film. The best thing about Vf or Vendetta is that the viewer is left to decide the answers for him or herself. This is a great movie and shouldn't be missed.So Id recommend it to those folks who like government and futuristic films",7,1,8,23 April 2010
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," not funny in the least bit
","This film was just horrible from start to finish. The only reason why I didn't get to see it in theaters was because every time I went it was sold out. Im surprised how this garbage got to be sold out so fast. It sure made a lot of money for the wrong reasons. Im happy I didn't get the chance to go. I recently seen it on TV one night and was not pleased at all. As I said before it was bad from start to finish. It was so draggy and just plain stupid. I mean, I couldn't stand it when they were saying grace for 20 minutes, I was just so bored. The jokes didn't tie in well with the film, and it definitely wasn't an impressive performance by Will Ferrel. I hated Will Ferrel's accent in this movie, along with the other characters. His kids also cheesed me off a lot. They're disrespectful little bastards. The scenes that were just plain dumb were when Ricky Bobby was driving in the car with an arm injury then the car exploded and jumped in the air. Afterwards Ricky jumped out the car thinking he was on fire, so he took off his clothes and started running around like an idiot. The stupid catch phrase between Ricky and Cal were stupid. All the characters in this movie were annoying. Especially Ricky Bobby and that French driver. I didn't laugh at barely anything in this movie. This has to be one of Will Ferrell's worst movies. If you value your life, you wouldn't watch this garbage",1,3,7,16 November 2008
Semi-Pro," Great movie but not that bad either
","Semi-Pro is a great movie but not that bad either, which isn't saying much because there is not much to say about this movie. It's not offensive, it has its funny moments, but it's not going to become part of the pantheon of great Hollywood classics. Its rated R and has lots has foul languages (many F-bombs). The movie has its funny moments and really weird moments. Funny moments were the poker scene, bear fighting scene, and possibly the last basketball game match between the tropics and spurs. There are some wack and unnecessary scenes like the hippy (dukes his name) wining $2000 and the vomit scene. I liked the performance of Andre Banjamin as Clearance 'Coffee' Black and the broadcasters. IMO, Monix's plot was needed, they made it too extra. The beginning was alright but the end was great.Entertaining, yes! Inspirational? No. A masterpiece? Definitely not. One other point: this movie is during the 1970s (1976) so that's why the players have afro's, and short-shorts.Altogether this movie was pretty good but could have been much better, especially the very last scene (how the movie ended), it could have been better. It seemed very rushed",6,0,0,26 August 2009
