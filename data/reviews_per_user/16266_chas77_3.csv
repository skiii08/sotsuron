The Blair Witch Project," A lot of people are missing the point...
","I think that a lot of the dissatisfied viewers are missing the point here. It's really quite a simple, effective movie. Not simple as 'for simpletons' or stupid people, but simple in that its whole set up relies on its minimalist structure.It's easy for a lot of people to say, 'why didn't they read the survival book, bring a cel phone, etc.' The point is, they didn't think they needed these items. These were cocky filmmakers who weren't worried. It was just going to be a weekend trip. If any of you have been camping before, I'm sure you can relate. As for the cel phone, did anyone think that maybe they couldn't afford one?As a guy who was a student filmmaker at one time, I can DEFINITELY relate to this. When you are in a film crew for a class you don't always have the luxury of knowing your crew-mates that well. You can't predict their responses to certain circumstances. I found the acting very realistic in this case. I thought back to my own film crew in jaded L.A. I honestly don't think that we would have fared much better. Maybe the smug types who think otherwise could watch a *realistic* movie like 'The Haunting' if they have such a hard time with this...",8,1,2,16 August 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Overlong mish-mash
","I've been reading the previous reviews and most of them appear to be divided into two camps: it was either a 'glorious' look at the glam rock days or it was a bizarre pro-homo mess. I loved Haynes' previous films ('Safe' and 'Superstar', which is pretty impossible to find, btw), but I was really disappointed in this. I don't care about the pro-gay sentiments, but in the end, Haynes seemed to forget the story he was filming. There is no  pay-off. Instead of probing into the decadent demise of the Slade character he goes off into this twisted wonderland of the journalist's memories. Sure, that was interesting (the fact that he hooked up with the Iggy character) but in the end, it would have been more satisfying to see some sort of real conclusion to the story, rather than seeing him having sex on the rooftop. Great costumes, make up, set design...too bad the overall execution couldn't have been better.",6,2,2,2 December 1998
Signs," Absolute Garbage
","'The Sixth Sense' was a genuine surprise that floored me, though, to be honest, it doesn't hold up so much on second viewing.'Unbreakable' had some good moments and acting but was ultimately a disappointment.'Signs,' from the get go, was absolute crap. I kept waiting for there to be some sort of payoff -- 3/4 of the way through, I knew this was not to be. Total disappointment. Every scene had camera angles which were 'telegraphed' -- that is, you know what's going to happen by the way he staged the camera. This is filmmaking for a children's Saturday morning show, not a real movie.Other writers on this page have commented on the bad acting and ridiculous dialogue so I won't bother going into that.I will never see another film made by this director again.** stars (out of ten!)",2,2,4,14 August 2002
