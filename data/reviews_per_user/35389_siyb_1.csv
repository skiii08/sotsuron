Resident Evil: Afterlife," Just awful
","I am a fan of the old school games of the series, as well as the last three movies. Even though the quality of the series seemed to fluctuate from movie to movie, I still managed to enjoyed every part, until now! First of all, the movie recycles concepts and ideas from other movies of the horror/action genre:<ul><li>Blade II: The 'special' zombies look an awful lot like Nomak and the new vampire breed.</li></ul><ul><li>The Matrix / Equilibrium: The action scenes are a mix between The Matrix and Equilibrium, both of which I personally liked better.</li></ul><ul><li>Silent Hill: The axe swinging zombie, which opens the gates to the prison and is fighting Alice and Claire in the shower rooms, resembles Pyramid Head of the Silent Hill video game series and Silent Hill the movie.</li></ul>In my opinion, the movie concentrated on elaborating a senseless, predictable and utterly boring plot. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting brainteaser, but in addition to the lack of zombie action and gore, the whole concept of the movie felt kinda pointless. I have the feeling, that, by putting the 3D label on a movie, writers and directors don't feel the need to produce quality movies any more. They probably think of the viewers as little babies, which are easily impressed by shiny objects and/or 3D omfg-slowmo-scenes.",4,0,2,1 November 2010
