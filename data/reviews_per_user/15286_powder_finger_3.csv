Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All special effects and no excitement
","It seems to be a trend these days with all big blockbuster up-coming movies. They buy the best actors but don't use them to their own advantage.  They put hundreds of scenes of special effects into the movie for the geeks. Sorry guys, but you are.  They add stupid characters like Jar Jar Binks who are not pivotal to the plot anywhere, but are only there to sell more action figurines.  This is why more and more people are focusing on independent movies.  Little budget for special effects, great plot/story content. Didn't the original 'Star Wars' have a little budget?  And how come the space ships and cruisers in this movie look more advanced than the ones in the future?",Null,0,1,13 December 1999
The Evil Dead," Cinematic Masterpiece
","The Evil Dead is truely an experience in terrifying funny horror.  Not that terrifying that it would have been all those years ago, but still pretty grousome.  I have watched the un-cut version many times and it is still good after the fifth time.  Bruce Campbell is very funny as he plays the tormented Ash.  Everyone just seems to be dying and turning into zombies around him!  The sequel disowns this one, but i think that it was better than the second.  The third is also very funny.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good comedy splatterfest.",Null,0,0,14 December 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," One word...
","I had been told this movie was bad.  I started to watch it with an open mind.  Then I slapped myself.  This, is bad.  Due to the guidelines i am not allowed to use profanity, but...this was so...so....so...shocking!!!! This type of movie sets the trend for more *god damn* Saturday Night Live stars to try their hand at movies.  Adam Sandler did it, but his movies were funny! This is appauling.  The acting is bad, the music is tedious and annoying, the plot reeked of that brown stuff.  I'm crying now.  It was just so bad. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to leave now.",Null,0,2,12 December 1999
