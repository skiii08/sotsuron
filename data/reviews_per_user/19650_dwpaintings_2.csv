It," You'll float too! A Dw Review...
","8.5/10
Must see! I watched it and again this week.
So that I was ready for 'It Ends Chapter 2' Release.
I'm surprised I didn't write this review earlier.I have seen this 4/5 times since 2017. One of my favourite movies. Hollywood did this one properly.
Not that the 1990 Tv series wasn't good, but this was done very well.
The cast was Great. The era References were really good. Bill as Pennywise is Perfect. Richie was funny. I actually laughed a lot through this movie. Takes a lot to scare me.Seeing the sets and being in some of those towns also brings North Hollywood Magic close to home.Off to see 'It Ends Chapter 2'...-Dw",9,0,0,8 September 2019
It Chapter Two," A perfect conclusion to a sequel
","7.5/10
Must see. It's a Conclusion movie
The follow up to the 2017 versionSo the first part laid out the story. A remake of a TV series from the 90's. This time though it had that North Hollywood magic which it made it one of my all-time favourite movies.
A lot of the same cast. Which was perfect the first time around. This version added seven more adult characters. Bill Hader who plays older Richie was perfect with his one liners and James McAvoy was on queue as Billy..
Once again though Pennywise steals the show with over the top performance.. there's a few concluding scenes throughout the movie that either explained or ended past storylines which I liked
Once again though I found myself laughing at many scenes. As I do not scare easily, lol. Overall I really enjoyed this movie. But I guess I was expecting a little bit more.
Huge 'It' fan 4/5 ðŸŽˆ...-Dw",8,5,8,8 September 2019
