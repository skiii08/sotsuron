The Equalizer," a silent killer
","Yes its predictable, but that is not a problem at all. Denzel W.plays a guy who reminds me of 'the book of eli' who kills 8 evil opponents at once. like: i am the nicest guy you have ever met, but you can not treat me like an idiot. you have been warned, but you didn't listen. in one scene he tells the dying gang leader: 'You should have taken the money' D. Washington is brilliant in that role.",10,1,1,2 November 2018
Fight Club," If you haven't seen it yet, you miss one of the the greatest movies ever.
","Fight Club is almost on every list of the greatest movies of all time, and one of the reasons might be: it is NOT a fight movie!
it is about modern society and the narrator's suffering due to his role in it. 
 which makes him sick. Fight Club has some of the funnniest and coolest scenes ever made in a movie. and one of the smartest stories ever!!! Brad Pit and Ed Norton, Meat Loaf, Helena Bonham Carter - all are brilliant. Brad Pitt deserved an oscar! This is the greatest role he ever has ever played. 
 don't read any spoilers, just watch it !!",10,0,0,15 September 2018
Climax," overrated
","There is nothing unique, nothing geniu. a party with dancing, alcohol and drug abuse clichees. thats pretty much the story of the film. end of the story. overrated and disapointing.",4,2,5,22 April 2020
Mulholland Drive," spoiler: the meaning of mulholland drive
","I have read many different tries of an explanation. but actually it is not that hard. A few minutes after the start, there is an important and underrated scene. Someone sleeps in a bed and the camera zooms in. THAT is the scene. After more than an hour, there is another key scene ... Betty (Naomi Warrs) wakes up. In the meantime strange things happened in the movie. What does that tell the viewer? You have seen a dream. Dreams symbolically show our fears, desires, hopes and feelings. a perfect way to show the situation of Bettie's soul. In the end, she commits suicide.",10,2,2,5 October 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," are you mind controlled
","I am shocked - about most of the reviews here. is that movie so missleading ? 
 is it, because you have seen orgy sex - seriously? haven't you seen orgy sex before on websites ? you certainly did. this movie is about satanism and the occult. satanism! and the sadest part is: the persons behind the masks. these are the leaders of the world.
 Kubrick exposes them in his last movie, before he died. this is not a medicore erotic thriller.",10,1,2,21 September 2018
