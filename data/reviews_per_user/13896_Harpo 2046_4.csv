Requiem for a Dream," A great film about addiction
","Requiem for a dream is one of the best films I have ever seen and I would like everyone to see this film, because it contains some beautiful scenes and this film is maybe even a horror film about addiction.  It is not only about drags but about TV, medicines... And at the end of the film I was quite terrified.  So if you see this film once, you will not dare to use drag.",10,0,1,2 July 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Not a master piece
","I was not not enthusiastic to see this movie and I was right.  It is not so good, as the critics said.  I think that the weakness in due to 2 things: -Annaud realised a film about the 2nd world war and he asks american and british actors to play in it -the music by Mr James Horner is horrible again(he is really not talented) so this is an interesting movie because the plot is good enough and the actors are great(except B.Hoskins), but you could have expected more than that",1,3,7,22 March 2001
Am√©lie," It is not a real great movie as everyone says
","I don't really understand why so many people say that this is one of the greatest films.  It is actually a pretty film, with an excellent style. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a good director and the film is not boring at all. However, is it a 'wonderful film' as some say?  I do not think so.  The actors are (of course) good, but Jeunet shows us Paris as a marvelous place. And yet, I know what Paris is like, since I live in that city.  And I can say that it is not the same thing at all.  I do not say to jeunet to be realistic (and anyway he could not be realistic), but just to be fair with this place, which is not a real wonder.",4,6,12,1 June 2001
The Truman Show," One of the best roles of J.Carrey
","I have seen this film many times, and I can say that I am ready to see this many other times.  There are several reasons, but the most important one is certainly J.Carrey.  I have seen many films in which he acts but in this film, he is really excellent.  And the next most important reason is A.Niccol, the writer and the director of 'Gattaca'.  If you liked 'Gattaca', you will probably like this one, because you will see the same kind of strange world.
I advise people to see this film, also because of E.Harris, who is one of the greatest actors today.",10,0,0,14 July 2001
