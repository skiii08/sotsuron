Casablanca," The greatest movie of all time!!!!!!
","If you like Humphrey Bogart (and who doesn't), you have GOT to own this movie.  If you have not seen it you are in for a real treat when you do. Bogart portrays a real pathos here that has been unsurpassed.  Ingrid Bergman as the woman torn between the two men she loves will tug at your heartstrings.  Some of Bogie's most famous lines are in this movie (i.e. Renaud; 'So Ricky why did you come to Casablanca?'  Rick: 'My health.  I came for the waters.'  Renaud: 'But Casablanca is in the middle of the desert.'  Rick: (In a very non chalant tone), 'I was misinformed.')  This movie has everything; comedy, drama, romance, and tragedy.  In my opinion, there is no other movie like Casablanca.  It is absolutely incomparable. You must see, rent, or buy this movie.",10,0,0,27 January 1999
