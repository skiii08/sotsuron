The Blair Witch Project," I'd like it would be ALL true...
","I saw it yesterday..before that, I've heard any kind of comment about this movie, from any kind of people... The end made me say: 'That's all??'...but the movie is terrific and, though they made a gross mistake when the guys are quarreling about the map-because it's evident there's a 4th people who's filming (maybe it's just the witch!)- I loved this movie and the idea and all of the scenes are so true and they gave me not fear but suspence, well, I had fun..some of my friends have been sick after seeing this footage, but I just found it unique and great! I wish it could be all TRUE..but I've already found out that the actors have played other movies after the project..well, I hoped they were died in that little house really... Does anyone want to visit those places with me next summer? 'I need you...'",8,0,1,24 February 2000
Notting Hill," Great locations, the final is too honey predictable..
","I love London, and I saw this movie after 2 days I came back from it and when I saw on screen those nice locations, like Notting Hill where I walked for hours lately, I really enjoyed and missed the city...but the movie, except for the scenes in London, the funny welsh friend of Hugh and the interesting-at first- love story between a normal one and a famous one, is not that good. I think it's predictable and quite boring and the main actors are not on their best: Hugh Grant is always the same again and Julia is not brilliant as -quite-always. 6/10..thanks to London.",6,0,0,19 August 2000
Man on the Moon," a great movie for a great man!
","I haven't heard about Andy Kaufman before this movie..I think once more Milos Forman did a very good and realistic movie, like the great 'the people vs Larry Flynt' or 'Amadeus' etc, and the actors are extremely excellent! A great movie which should make you think about what is really true in your life and if everything is just an illusion and not only in your mind.. Kaufman was a great person, a real artist as few have been, a sort of genius or better someone who understood a lot about life...he surely has reached the immortality.",10,0,0,30 April 2000
The Incredibles," amazing and sweet
","i went yesterday to watch this animation movie and it really surprised me and enlightened my evening! the animation is perfect and some scenes seem a real movie! the characters are so lovely and realistic in their incredibility and you love them all after a few minutes! there are beautiful backgrounds i loved the seaside they made and the funny scene when flash runs fastest to escape from enemies! it's a really huge animation movie, it doesn't make you laugh a lot but it really entertains you with quality and fun and suspense! It's for all the family! Very funny for its sweet nonsense also the animation before the movie, a corto about enjoying life with fun and not thinking at all!",9,0,1,9 December 2004
Marriage Story," Great female cast but so boring
","I really had an hard time finishimg this movie!
I found it boring and slow. Nothing new or a different point of view on telling about people splitting up.
I appreciated the actresses, especially Laura Dern and Scarlett.
I only loved the monologue of Scarlett with Laura/Nora at the begininning: Nora seemed more a shrink than a lawyer!",5,0,2,18 December 2019
Cube," Don't search for anything in this cube life...
","This movie means a lot for me..it's just the best way to represent life: our life is just as a big cube where there's no way out and every cubic room which is part of the big one is not so different from each other..some are safe some not, some are red some are white... Everyone is different from the other just for a stupid name or employment sewn as a label on your no sense existence.. Anyone tries to find out an assuring meaning not to feel that he/she is nothing and there's nothing behind that door...because everything is already inside yourself.",9,0,1,16 April 2000
