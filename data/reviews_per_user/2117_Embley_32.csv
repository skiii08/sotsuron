The Legend of Bagger Vance," what happened?
","i am disappointed.  to be honest i thought from the advertisments that this film would not be great but i figured if it was a robert redford film with will smith and matt damon it had to have something to it.  but it didn't really.the best things about this film were will smith and some of the camera work. matt damon wasn't bad.  but the script was very unfortunate and i don't think the actors could have done much with it.  will smith seemed to be given the amusing lines to say and his smiling face is full of light that brightens up the screen always.so the script.  yes it was very bad.  no real character development, no thrill to the story, everything felt very rushed.  it is hard for a film to live up to a book - the book this was based on was not fantastic, in fact it was kind of cheesy at points, but it was very lyrical and had moments of real beauty - these characteristics did not make it through to the film, though.  the script for the film was quite different form the book and i think that was a huge downfall.  the whole romance storyline was created for the film and it felt flat to me - no depth to it at all.  the relationship between junah and bagger vance is also very different and suffers for it i think.  there is little chance for a bond to develop between the two and bagger vance comes off as a wandering life-saver, instead of the mystical all-knowing god that he was in the book.  the whole premise of the book - looking at golf as a analogy for the human condition - gets lost somewhere. the film is very thin, little substance if any, and while it doesn't look bad, it doesn't look great - the looks won't carry the film.and the editing was quite bad.  there was no flow to the film.  it felt very choppy and there were often cuts or transitions at the wrong points so that it was unclear where the focus of the scene was.  i was amazed that this film was released in such a choppy state.  very sad.this is redfords worst directorial work - and it pains me to say that because i admire the man and his work greatly.  but there you go - no denying it.",2,4,8,31 October 2000
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Definitely an experience...
","You know, I have to say that I had my reservations about seeing this film. There was something about drag queens singing in the Australian Outback that seemed unappealing to me (god knows why!).  I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would.  I watched it during my Terence Stamp film festival and he is great  as a woman.The acting is very good, not a bad plot, great costumes (although I don't think they would work on just anybody) - at times I will say that it was a little too colourfully crass for me, I guess my taste is a little more subtle, but I still enjoyed the film.",5,2,7,21 March 2000
Requiem for a Dream," bleak to say the least
","i can't say i ENJOYED this film - it isn't the kind of film you can really have a good time at..  it is depressing and bleak and leaves you feeling drained.  i thought the performances were good, some of the camera work was beautiful and the colours were amazing, and the editting was very good.
but i got bored of the repetition.  i get that it was possibly reflecting the repetition in the characters lives, but i just found it a little too much after a while.  and i also found the freakish hallucinations by the mother with regard to the tv show late in the film a little too much for me. it didn't mesh with the rest of the film as far as i was concerned. 
but i thought the parallel between the mother and the son's habits was very interesting and the gradual deterioration of all of their lives (although they didn't seem to have much to deteriorate from) was well done.overall it isn't exactly an easy film, but well worth checking out if you don't mind a bit of work.",6,0,0,3 November 2000
Spartacus," holy over-rated
","i thought for some reason that i would find this film interesting if not entertaining, as it was i just found it boring.  it was next to impossible to stay awake through it.  there were a few scenes that were amusing only because of the overly dramatic quality.i guess it is a good film to have watched but i don't get why everyone loves it so much.  kirk douglas was so much better in Paths of Glory..",2,9,27,27 May 2000
Casablanca," definitely stands the test of time.....
","throughout much of my childhood my mother would only let me stay up past bedtime if we watched casablanca or the african queen - i couldn't appreciate it at the time, but casablanca was and is a truly wonderful film. it is funny, romantic, tragic, heroic and smart.  bogart is brilliant. if you haven't watched it lately than you should have another look at it.",10,1,1,10 May 1999
Erin Brockovich," Steven Soderbergh does it again
","I wasn't going to see this film - there was too much about Julia Roberts' breasts in the trailer - but I just watched the Limey the other day and a generally reliable friend told me that Erin Brockovich was really good so what are you gonna do?It was pretty good.  I think I liked the Limey better because it was more interesting looking and had Terence Stamp - sorry but Julia is no Terence. 
You really can't go wrong with a script based on a true story - at least not if the story is interesting.  Erin Brockovich is everything A Civil Action wanted to be.The absolutely terrifying thing about this film is at some point I thought just how many times do we have to hear these stories about big companies killing off the little people in the world.  It makes a person scared to trust anyone or anything.Anyway - great story.  Thank God for film makers like Soderbergh who know that story and character is what it is all about.",6,0,2,22 March 2000
Fight Club," A dissenting opinion....
","S**t - I had a whole review written and then I accidentally hit escape and erased the whole thing.Basically Fight Club was bad.  Which is really unfortunate because I was looking forward to another great film from David Fincher.I read over some of the other comments made by users here, and I was really surprised that every single one I read was a positive review.  It really makes me wonder about the film-going public...I actually thought the premise itself was quite interesting - lonely guy seeks way to connect with other individuals in the modern world.  Going to the support groups was interesting, forming fight club with 'Tyler Durden' was interesting.  Somehow though I just wish that guys could vent their frustrations or anger or unhappiness without resorting to violence - though I am starting to see that is an impossibility.  It must be coded into their genes (which is a REALLY good excuse - I love that one...)Now don't misunderstand me - I am not squeamish about violence - some of the fight sequences were well done and I enjoyed them - it is a rare thing that I will turn my eyes away in horror because of violence - there is a perverse fascination with it in my psychological make-up and I am certainly not the only one.  But when I was sitting watching the film (and I honestly wasn't too thrilled about it already because it was just a bit boring) during the scene where Edward Norton beats the blond kid to a shadow of his former self, I became offended.  And not specifically because of the beating.  That was horrifying and I think (hope?) most people would find it horrifying. What offended me was the handful of young men who were whooping and cheering the beating on from the audience.  That was frightening.I don't think it is arguable that this film does glorify violence in a very bad way.  It makes it cool to beat people up and to get beaten up. Other reviews I read argued that it doesn't glorify violence because it makes the drones in Durden's terrorist army look stupid or something.  Well yes they do look stupid - I don't think that people go out looking to be a stupid 'drone' but they do look for leadership (ie Nazi Germany).  Furthermore it seems to me that more people would be interested in being Tyler Durden. That is how it glorifies violence with respect to terrorist organizations - it wouldn't necessarily make you want to follow in one, it makes it look cool to lead one.  I would like to think that people are not stupid enough to fall for that kind of thing, but I know I am wrong and I think Fincher gives the general public to much credit for intelligence and being able to think on their own.Moving on - I hated the 'twist' [details deleted].  How lame, what a predictable cop out.  And I thought it was poorly done - implausible if you look back at the rest of the film.  That really put the nails in the coffin of this film.I actually thought Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham-Carter were pretty good.  I wonder how different the original screenplay looked from the finished product.One other thing - I read a review from an LA critic that stated that the worst thing about this film is that it THINKS it conveys a message.  Close - I think it TRIES to convey a message but whatever that message was, it is not effectively conveyed.  Sure it says consumerism ans capitalism are bad, it then goes on to say fight the system with whatever (violent) means necessary...  And does not really contradict that message ever.  Is this the message Fincher intended?  I do not think that Norton's character running around trying to make things right at the end (when it was clear that that was impossible) turns around the core message of the film...  What a disaster.",3,1,4,17 October 1999
Shakespeare in Love," charming
","i went into shock when this film won the academy award for best film.  i mean it was good but it wasn't THAT good.  but i digress.  the acting was great - everyone was perfect in their role (although i have to say that cate blanchett should have gotten the best actress oscar and why geoffrey rush was nominated for this film and not elizabeth i will never understand..  but for some reason i actually expect every year that the academy will award films that are deserving and every year i am disappointed..) and the writing was stupendous..  tom stoppard performs magic with dialogue..the costumes and sets were beautiful and the overall feel of the film was lovely.it was amusing, romantic and well-paced.  overall it was eminently enjoyable and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a higher level of escapist fare than is normally offered at your local blockbuster..  but the academy award for best film?  methinks 'tis a stretch .",8,0,1,29 October 2000
Billy Elliot," sweet film with grim edges..
","jamie bell really does an amazing job in this film.  when he first danced i thought - my god why would anyone think he could dance?  but in fact he moves in a really unique way and he comes across as very original.  as it turns out i wish we had seen him dance more.  he has style.julie walters and gary lewis are also very good.  it is definitely a performance driven film.  it has the requisite tears and laughter (my only real beef with the film is that debbie drops out of sight half way through the film and i thought she was great so i wanted to see her more and find out what happened in her life as well...it is a nice film, well worth seeing, although i don't think it is entirely necessary to see it on the big screen (well everything is better on the big screen but you won't lose a huge amount visually in the transition from the screen to video..)",7,0,0,16 November 2000
X-Men," it was okay
","well i wasn't expecting to love it..  and i didn't.  it had a few cool effects, and a few cool characters..  but for the most part i found myself a bit bored..  i didn't think the film makers really went as far with it as they could have..  but it was entertaining enough, although i don't know how happy i am to have paid $9.00 for the experience..",3,1,2,21 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," pretty but useless
","this film had a lot of potential - it's a great story and has the potential to be very creepy.  but of course tim burton doesn't really do creepy films, he does wacky cartoonish films.  and i usually like tim burton's stuff. but i thought this film was really weak.  the best thing about the film (and it is actually worth seeing just for this) was the art direction - the film has an amazing intangible quality to it.  the script was not good.  it was boring in parts and confusing in other parts, and there was no building of characters.  i never really cared that people were having their heads lopped off by a headless being.  i thought johnny depp had a good thing going with his approach to the character, but given that the script was weak he couldn't go too far with it - and i was very irritated by the attempts at a slight accent on his and christina ricci's parts.anyway, it is sadly not a great film and not worth seeing unless you are interested in the art direction.",3,3,6,20 May 2000
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," 'who are those guys?'
","Hilarious - the dialogue in this film is great as is the acting by Newman and Redford - they have something between them that lights up the screen. I dearly wish they would do one more film together...  with regards to this film though, it is great - a western with great wit, romance and tragedy [as they all seem to have].",9,0,3,10 May 1999
The Beach," not as bad as i had been led to believe but still not good..
","i probably would never even have bothered with seeing this movie except that i got to do so for free..  and then there is the danny boyle factor - how could it be all bad if mr. boyle was the director.  and actually there were a few cinematic moments that i thought were mighty fine.  unfortunately i thought that much of the film was tainted by leonardo dicaprio - i just found him boring and pompous - and i know his character was supposed to be pretty puffed up, but it was all false puffiness..  he couldn't carry it off..  there are other actors who could have pulled it off much better i think.  and then there is the whole premise of the film which i thought was a bit over blown.  maybe it was just marketed poorly, but i didn't really see the big deal about finding this beach.  maybe the characters needed to build a bit more beforehand or something but it was just a bit wishy-washy overall..  but surprisingly not as horrific as i was expecting.",3,1,2,24 July 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," not bad considering what it is...
","suffice to say i had pretty low expectations for this when i took it home. but i heard it was based on taming of the shrew and i thought that might be interesting, so....  and i enjoyed it.  who would have thought.  i mean it is not a great movie by any means, there are a dozen or more scenes to roll your eyes at..  but there were several funny moments and a few touching points.  it is not as crappy as most of the teen flicks that are coming out these days..  julia stiles and heath ledger are very good.  worth watching just for them (if you like them)..  some of the dialogue is not bad - mostly stiles lines..  not much of note other than that.",4,4,8,2 July 2000
Notting Hill," Amusing
","this film is a bit of fluff but it has a few good belly laughs.  I think it also displays the superiority of many english actors to american ones.  no offense to julia roberts but she was definitely the weakest point of the movie.  hugh grant was good (the role seemed a bit familiar), but the shining stars of the film were rhys ifans and gina mckee, who played spike and bella.  bravo and brava.",6,1,2,28 May 2000
American Psycho," Surprisingly boring
",There was so much hype around this film that it was hard to go into it without any preconceptions.  I tried to read the book ages ago but was bored stiff by the descriptions of what Patrick Bateman wore and all his expensive doo-dad's.  When I heard that the movie was going to be done very tongue in cheek I was pretty apprehensive about it - that could go so so wrong.  In actual fact it did not go all that wrong.  It was not funny (at least not to me) especially in the way I thought it would be done and the way it was portrayed in the teasers.  I expected it to be cartoonish and it was not.  But I also expected it to be disturbing to some degree and it was not.  I find the fact that it was not disturbing very disturbing.  This is a story of a sociopathic serial killer - who kills many people and kills them fairly graphically on screen.  And yet it was not all that disturbing..  I guess that says something about me..  I was bored and just wanted the movie to be over.  I guess some of the book really did creep through to the film.,2,1,5,13 May 2000
The Patriot," lethal weapon of the 18th century (and that's not a good thing..)
","what crap.  i walked out in disgust after 2 hrs.  i just couldn't take it anymore, although i hear it got worse.  it was awful, bad script, corny, annoying..  i was amazed that the audience responded to it so well - cheering the killing scenes and buying all the gooey hollywood crap. gawdawful for sure.  avoid avoid avoid...",1,16,32,1 July 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," much fun
","great movie - some of the most amazing kung fu i have seen on film.  this is a fun film, it is magical, the story isn't bad, and the visuals are great. michelle yeow is excellent and so is chow yun fat (although michelle yeow deserved top billing..)ang lee does it again...",8,0,0,29 September 2000
Rules of Engagement," crap
","i went to see the late show of this film at my local theatre because ghost dog was sold out.  i walked out after an hour because i was bored stiff and realized i would way rather be spending my time in bed sleeping than sitting through this tedious film.the only redeeming feature in the film is samuel jackson, but the film mars his name in my book - i can't imagine why he chose to make it unless it looked pretty good on paper.  in reality it is a godawful mess.",2,10,20,10 April 2000
Mission: Impossible II," What a drag
","No chemistry, no plot, no excitement, no connection to the characters. Boring.  And cheesy.  Yuck.  Tom Cruise was about the only decent thing in this mediocre film but even he could not make it worth the price you have to pay these days to see a first run movie.  What is it with John Woo?  I really liked his Chow Yun Fat films but ever since he started doing american films he sucks..  It's really sad.",2,0,0,26 May 2000
Annie Hall," one of the most brilliant films of all time..
",this film is hilarious - woody allen was way ahead of his time and this film is easily watchable over and over - funnier the more you see it.,10,3,5,10 May 1999
The Hurricane," Incredible story, great film
","The story is too unbelievable to be real, it is horrifying and ridiculous, and fantastically told by Norman Jewison and Denzel Washington.  Washington is a force to reckon with in this film.  I can't imagine anyone else could have pulled off the role.  He is amazing.The story here is overwhelming and I am disturbed as of late to hear rumours that the script is nowhere close to reality.  I have looked into this a little further and can find no indication at all that the film has misportrayed any instance except perhaps a few instances that would have been difficult or confusing to the audience.  It isn't supposed to be a documentary.  Anyway if anyone has further information regarding this please let me know - my email is embley@excite.com.This movie was very good and deserves more than it has gotten.  Rubin Hurricane Carter must be a rare and amazing individual.",7,0,2,10 April 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," Thank God for Frank Capra!
","Capra made many films that were really good, but It's a Wonderful Life is a truly GREAT film.  I have seen it an uncountable number of times and it never fails to bring a tear to my eye. The story is well crafted and the film brilliantly composed. It shows so well the dark side of human nature and also how it shines so very bright.  I will watch this movie regularly for the rest of my life.",10,1,4,10 May 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Not #1 material
","This film was good, don't get me wrong, but in a million years it would never have occurred to me that this film would rank # 1 in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 films [ I hope this doesn't last - it's april 1999]. It is ridiculous.  It is a good story, has good acting/character development, medium cinematography/music/everything else etc.....As enjoyable as any other half decent film - but not number one in MY top 250 - probably not even in my top 250.",Null,0,1,23 April 1999
Paths of Glory," horror
",i was very impressed with this film - it details the petty politics of war very well.  it is a horrible story.  the acting is great as is the look and feel of the film.  it made me feel as though there were bugs crawling up my arm but there was nothing i could do about it.,6,8,15,24 April 2000
The Sixth Sense," Made me jump but it doesn't deserve an Oscar
","I just watched this one again - it made me jump the second time too, and it was interesting to watch it knowing the twist at the end.  It's not bad - worth a viewing, especially if you like thrillers.  That poisoned girl scared the s**t out of me when I saw the movie the first time.  I thought this film was creepier than Blair Witch.But Bruce Willis is mediocre at best.  He is not a serious actor, he was fine in Die Hard and he should keep to that genre - this film would've been better with someone else.  Haley Joel Osment was pretty good for a kid but I cannot believe he is nominated for an Oscar.  Never mind that this film is nominated for best film.  It really shows just how BAD the Oscars are.",6,0,0,26 March 2000
Rear Window," best hitchcock
","i went to see a new print of this last night and it has been a while since i last saw the film.  i was a little disappointed at first by the characters - they were really annoying to start off with - but they grew on me and by the half-way mark i was right into it.  it is a really good film - james stewart and grace kelly are very good (once you get into the film) and raymond burr - who would've thought! great hitchcock fare, a must see.",8,0,1,12 August 2000
The Matrix," very cool in some respects
","this movie utilized some of the greatest special effects seen in any film in the last 10 years.  there were some awe-inspiring sequences. 
and for the most part i thought the characters and acting were very good - with one exception of course.  keanu reeves is a bizarre phenomena.  he is a terrible actor - at least at any character that requires any depth at all. he is fine in stuff like bill & ted or point break.  i can't figure out what it is that makes him so popular with the public.  i mean he is good looking but i can't believe it goes THAT far!  if it does that is pathetic.  what am i saying.  of course it goes that far and of course it is pathetic.the plot of this film was very interesting but it was executed in a way that was a little too comic book-ish for me.  other than these two things i thought it was a greatly entertaining film which anyone who hasn't seen should check out.",8,0,0,10 April 2000
The Thin Red Line," 2 1/2 hours (give or take) that I will never get back...
","There are too many things I could complain about with this film.  I thought it was really bad.  So if you can just accept I hated everything about it except one thing - Sean Penn - I will let it go at that.
But Sean Penn was great - the only thing that seemed to make sense in an otherwise useless waste of time and money.",1,1,3,3 February 2000
Gladiator," The first true epic in a while
","Wow.I went into this film pretty sure I would hate it.  Wow.  I was pretty impressed.  It has been a long time since I have seen a film that had an epic feel to it in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur did.. Not that it is a perfect film or anything.  It is great escapism.  Russell Crowe is fantastic - MAXIMUS.  How can you go wrong with Ancient Rome and all those great latin names?The art direction was very good - thank god they covered the actors in dirt. It always sucks to see clean and pristine 20th century actors portraying characters from the middle ages or ancient times.I thought also that this was one of the first big budget films to really pull off using some surreal effects.  Often they stick out like a sore thumb, but I felt they were very effective in this film.The only problem I had with the film I think was that when Maximus was taken to the desert and made a gladiator, the whole sequence of events was too short.  He's taken away, he is sold into gladiator slavery, he rises to the top of the gladiators, and then he is sent back to Rome to fight for the emperor.  It needed to be spread out just a little.  I know it was a long film, but another few minutes in that part of the film would have done wonders.I particularly liked the camera work during the fight sequences.  Very nice.",9,0,0,13 May 2000
All the President's Men," redford, hoffman and watergate - what could be better?
",i don't know why i love this film so much - i first saw it one afternoon at my grandmother's house on tv and i was sucked in immediately.  i've watched it countless times since and there is something about 1970's political thrillers that really hits the nail on the head.  this one has everything you could want in a political thriller and it is based on fact! unmissable.,10,2,3,10 May 1999
High Fidelity," huh, i liked it, who would've thought..
","as often seems to be the case i expected annoying.  as less often seems to be the case it was not..  although it did take me about half the film to get into it.  i was irritated that men are so god damn stupid.  so that made it hard to like the main character.  he was an ass and he was stupid.  but it was nice to see a kind of gradual growth of the character - and i think it was pretty subtle.  i mean this film is not deep, but by the end of the film i did like him and he had changed. everyone in the film was good.  john and joan are ALWAYS good.  jack black was very good.  and i really like iben hjejle.  my major beef was that she was so far down the list in the end credits.  hello?  what was that about?? she was half the film and ends up AFTER sarah gilbert who had, what 3 lines, and a minute of screen time?  anyway.  i did not read the book.  i hear it is great.  the film wasn't bad.  way better than i expected.  worth seeing when you are in the right mood.  of course that is always the challenge.",6,0,1,13 July 2000
