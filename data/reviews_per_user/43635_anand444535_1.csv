Captain Phillips," Take a bow 'Captain Phillips'
","I had no clue about the film till i entered the movie theater. I didn't even know it was Tom Hanks who portrayed 'Captain Phillips' . I didn't even know it was a true story. Strange but all these are true. I was desperate to watch a movie, and tickets for no other movies not being available i chose 'Captain Phillips'.With no expectations i stepped into the steep movie theater, stumbled for sometime to find my seat, took some time to adjust myself and finally looked onto the screen. There were some African people speaking in their own language(Of course i had to see the subtitle. Oh gosh i hate 'em). I thought i made a wrong decision choosing this movie. Then the man entered 'Tom Hanks' with his big beard and phenomenal voice(Ah! This movie is going to be good). After some 10 minutes I was totally spell bound and was glued to the seat. The pirates taking over the ship was spectacularly shown(Take a bow Paul Greengrass).The pirates, whoever portrayed those characters, though it was their 1st movie those people acted so well(I'd have believed them to be real pirates as well!). Tom Hanks was as usual at his best. After SEAL starts their operation each and every scene was so well pictured. The execution of those 3 pirates was superb.Tom Hanks did spectacularly well after that. I now really admire the original 'Captain Phillips'. Take a bow Captain Phillips.",10,6,11,25 October 2013
