Ford v Ferrari," Ford Vs. Ford
","Fantastic movie. I know nothing about cars yet this film captured me and held me 'til the end. I found myself feeling the tension and adrenaline of the races. The characters are easy to root for, they feel authentic, real and, most of all, imperfect. The conflict comes mostly from the inside of Ford, which was very interesting to me. Ferrari is a secondary source of conflict, way behind the own suit men of Ford.The only things I'd change are very small. Sometimes, we got intercuts from the adrenaline of the races to Miles' wife and son at home listening to the radio. This was frustrating to me. I wanted to see the races, where the action was, and I felt there were a little too many of these intercuts. Also, Miles' arc felt slightly unmotivated to me. I never understood what made him decide to actually accept and tie the race with the other two Ford cars. Even Carroll Shelby's petition wasn't a very intense one, as to make Miles change his whole personality for it.All and all, this is a fantastic movie, with a great script and great performances, and it definitely is worth a watch.",8,2,3,23 February 2020
10 Cloverfield Lane," Fascinating thriller. It hooks you from beginning to end
","Wow. What a great movie. The elements that I consider make this film great are : 1) the constant doubt that both the protagonist and us, the audience, have, on whether John Goodman's character is telling the truth or no and 2) The constant conflict in the film. There is not a single moment where the movie turns boring, or when it feels nothing is happening. The movie seizes every single second of its length to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The way the mystery gradually unwraps, and how the real John Goodman's character comes to light work great on keeping this tense environment at all times. No doubt, a great movie, and one I will recommend to thriller and overall movie fans.",8,0,0,20 April 2020
Se7en," Engaging, fascinating, impactful
","It has it all. A great premise. Two opposite but equally relatable protagonists, great pace, a story that doesn't stop moving forward, a fascinating villain... The morbid images and the intriguing situation will keep you hooked. It may slow down just a little for a few minutes in the second half of the second act, but it still is very good. The third act and climax are a masterpiece.",7,0,0,4 December 2019
Captain Marvel," Good, not great
","The best part of this movie is the relationship between Fury and Carol. It's witty, believable and compelling. I also liked the plot twist when we're revealed the true villain. Although I had seen it coming, I think it helps adding more depth to the characters (both the villain and the green alien guy), which has been missing in most Marvel movies. This is not to say this movie's villain is extremely compelling, because it's really not, but at least has some layer of depth. On the other hand, I had trouble to care for the characters. I felt most of them were bland. Specially the hero. She needed a scene where we actually built empathy with her. I only started caring for her when Nick Fury's life was also in danger. For me, the worst part of the script is the third act. It felt too long, involving at least 4 different fights, instead of one that successfully tied in the whole story. In my opinion, this happens because the script is too busy trying to set-up stuff for the sequels (like Ronan's appearance that impacts in no way to the plot). These scenes should've been left for the after-credits, instead of the flat scenes we got there. It's a good movie, but I don't think it has enough elements to be considered a classic in the Marvel Universe.",6,2,4,19 March 2019
This Is the End," Great humor
","The movie's greatest strength is the fact that it never takes itself too serious. But, even then, its script follows a traditional structure. It does take some liberties when adding ridiculous montages (when they fix the house at the beginning of act two or when they get high, the couple times or so they do).
The plot escalates into ridiculousness but it always makes sense within the story world, which is another strength.I do have to say that the first act felt too long and boring at times. It takes 16 minutes for the apocalypse to start. In these kind of movies, the audience is here to watch the characters deal with the apocalypse. The first act has to establish the basic story world and characters, but I think the movie could've done this in 10 minutes, maybe even less, as opposed to the long 16 minutes.Still, a pretty funny movie.",6,0,1,27 March 2020
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Very enjoyable
","This is an above average romantic comedy with a little of buddy movie in it. It manages to work with at least four subplots together with the main plot at a great pace, so there is not a single boring part. The revelations along the way and how the film intertwines all the subplots with the main plot is an example of great writing.",8,1,2,22 January 2019
Knives Out," Oscar-worthy
","The simple structure of the screenplay is fascinating. It starts with an introduction to both the characters and a basic idea of what happened the night of the crime. As the story advances and unfolds, it picks on each element established in the set-up to expand on it and deliver more clues as to what really happened.
Simultaneously, we're surprisingly revealed to the, we think, murderer. It's a beautiful case of study, because the precise murder is what makes us feel empathy for the protagonist, Marta. Then, we follow the story seeing Benoit Blanc as the antagonist that attempts to capture Marta. The film takes advantage of this by building tension and conflict and the loose ends of the murder. As things escalate, we begin to see there is something behind all that. The action and tension is impressive and non-stop and, even with a runtime of over 2 hours, there is not a single second that is boring.
The film uses every single element it established for turns, twists, or tension/conflict-building in an impressive way.The only 'but' I can mention is the climax that, for me, felt just a little underwhelming. However, this can be due to my own hypothesis, and I wouldn't blame the film for that.Overall, this is a must see.",8,1,3,15 December 2019
About Time," Best movie ever made
","Every person in the world should have the legal obligation to watch this movie. It's beautiful, it's endearing, it's sweet, but it's also heavy, it's an intense emotional journey.",10,1,1,10 June 2019
Megamind," Fresh and great
","Megamind is one of the best animated films. It manages to take a common subject, superheroes, and twist it to give us a fresh take on it. The comedy is great. The dialogues are very good. Each characters speaks different, according to their worldviews. My only complain is the plot twist of Metro Man being alive and retired. For me, it feels like cheating in the writing because it lacks a set-up for it. However, I'm willing to let that pass because the rest of the movie is very greatly written.",7,0,0,31 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I liked it! Although I'm not sure I loved it
","The movie is a solid ending to the new trilogy. It was so many emotive, nostalgic moments that worked great on me and moved me. For example, seeing Luke and Leia in their prime, training, or Luke lifting his X-Wing out of the sea. The overall pace is perfect. Never slows down, never gets boring. Rey's internal struggle is equally solid and visual. Seeing Rey throwing lightnings out of her hands was impressive and shocking. And, although I didn't hate Last Jedi, JJ gets extra credits for fixing that little mess.
On the other hand, there a few things I felt were unnecessary. First off, obviously, that weeeeeird kiss. Not set-up, no reason for it. Second, some characters and the confusing romantic relationship between characters. It felt like at one point, Rey could end up with anyone in the cast. Then, Poe gets his girl, and nothing comes out of it. Then Finn, who kissed Rose in the last film, meets another character, also former stormtrooper, but nothing comes out of it either. Neither of those two characters felt special, and neither really adds anything. They're only there because the plot needs them.
I also feel that, even though I liked the climax, Palpatine never felt unbeatable. He was, in fact, just a little dull for me. I did like how Rey came from behind and beat Palpatine, and I liked how Kylo sacrificed for her. Also, Palpatine being Rey's grandfather was great for me.
Overall, it's a nice ending for the trilogy, and presumably the saga. I admit being on the verge of tears in a few occasions. I liked it! The denouement with Rey saying she's a Skywalker in Tatooine was beautiful.",7,4,10,24 December 2019
Notting Hill," A very high level romcom
","This is a great example of how a romantic comedy can stick to the formula and yet feel inspired and original. The characters are great and I found myself very soon empathizing with them. Even the supporting ones get their chance to shine and don't disappoint. The relationships between them is very good. The diner scene in Thacker's sisters' birthday was particularly tender and endearing. The main conflict of the movie is driven by the on/off relationship between the protagonists, as well as some external situations like the arrival of Anna Scott's bf, her leaked photos or the paparazzis. Aside from the natural dialogue scenes where the romance is built, the story keeps moving forward. And even then, the dialogue felt inspired. The third act was exciting and thrilling. We've seen car chases scenes before, but this one was filled with tense, perhaps product of the great connection the movie made us built with the protagonist. I could feel the urge and tension, which is what it's all about.
Notting Hill is one of the best, sweetest romcoms out there, hands down. No wonder it was the magnificent Richard Curtis who wrote it.",7,0,0,12 October 2019
Shrek Forever After," Pretty solid
","It's natural with franchises to compare one with the rest. In this case, Shrek 4 is below the first two. However, I'll dare to say that, as a single film, Shrek 4 is actually pretty good. It kept my attention during the whole film, the humor was pretty good, the reencounters Shrek has with the rest of the characters were special, the conflict was constant and, althoufh simple, strong enough to keep the film moving. If we avoid comparing this film with the rest in the franchise, and focus specifically on it as a film, it is actually more solid than I remembered.",7,2,2,8 September 2019
Ocean's Eleven," Always moving
","This is an example of a screenplay that keeps the conflict up and, therefore, is entertaining from beginning to end. Every single scene has conflict, sometimes so subtle it's artistic. The main characters are very likable, the revelations, specially in the climax, are very well executed, and the action is non-stop, even if it doesn't mean weapons and shots all over the place. The pace is fast, which might cause a little trouble following, and perhaps a little more of setting up some of the stuff of the third act would've been nice, since there are a few points in the script the audience could've never anticipated with the provided information. Even with that, it's a great, very entertaining experience.",8,1,1,3 July 2019
Inside Out," Greatly crafted!
","This is a great story in every sense. The world building was complicated, given the number of details and elements they had to establish. However, the work they did was magnificent. The plot is flawless, with every event logically provoking the next one, and every solution to problems having been set up in earlier scenes. The characters are, all of them, endearing. The empathy is built masterfully, and I found myself highly stressed after the islands began to fall. I was worried for Joy and the other guys, but mostly for Riley. She's not the hero of the story by no means, but having her represent and innocent victim of the struggles of the emotions is great and really made, at least me, more engaged in the story and the stakes. These elements made me struggle not to let a tear out at certain points of the movie, like when Bing Bong sacrifices himself or when Riley reunites with her family. This is a very relatable movie, we were all 11 after all, and is one of Pixar's best.",8,0,0,9 July 2019
Yesterday," A beautiful journey
","I really enjoy the execution of an already fascinating idea of a world where the Beatles never existed. The route chosen by Richard Curtis, to intertwine the raise to fame of the protagonist with his friend/love relationship with his manager/best friend was a very smart decision that had a strong emotional impact in specific moments of the film. The visit to Lennon was impressive and moving. On a small side note, he had me in the climax when Ellie is shown in Wembley's screen, but then lost me when the protag decided to reveal his secret, as opposed to, first, confess his love to Ellie, which was what was driving that particular moment of the story. However it is, I really liked he film.",7,1,2,11 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Incredible journey
","This is an emotional roller coaster that honors in a superb way the last 10 years of Marvel movies. It's a perfect conclusion to an era. It's 3 hours long but it feels like 1. It all happens so fast. I was on the verge of tears like 5 or 6 times. The dilemma Tony faces throughout the movie is very well executed. The characters, although many, have enough things to do during the movie. It's non-stop action and it never gets slow. The script has, naturally, the advantage of dealing with characters (and a situation) we already know and love, and that are well defined, but creates something new with it all. It's been an incredible journey. And a part of the journey, is the end.",8,0,2,30 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Pixar is back
","I was highly concerned for this movie. Toy Story 3 was a great conclusion for the franchise and to justify a 4th installment it had to be not only a good film but a superior one to the third. And it is. The dilema Woody faces is the toughest yet and therefore the most interesting to watch, and what makes this one the best Toy Story yet (and hopefully ever). His decisions, according to the dilema, are actually suprising, and really show who Woody's character really is. The comedy is actually pretty good. The ending is heartbreaking and the journey is filled with all kinds of emotions.
My only complain, maybe small to some, is the exclusion of most of the classic characters, like Slinky, Rex, or Mr Potato Head (who, I think, gets a single line of dialogue in the whole film). Other than that, Pixar has come back after a, in my opinion, not as good spree with Cars 3 and Incredibles 2 (to Pixar standards). I loved it.",8,18,32,28 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Highly disapponted
","You could cut out everything but the last fight scene and it would be a way better movie than it is. The story lacks, well, story. There's no plot. The subplots are pointless (Why was Margot Robbie's character in there?), most of the movie consists of scenes of movies the characters are filming, that, for the most part, lack any conflict whatsoever, the edition is rough, and way too noticeable, and there are too many shots that are just for nostalgia, and add nothing to the already lacking plot. I came in excited for this movie and I feel I wasted two and a half hours of my life. Wow.",5,4,7,28 August 2019
Aladdin," Good but how couldn't it be
","I'm not a huge fan of Disney's remaking spree. Having said that, this movie is good. It adds on a few fun gags to the original story. However, in essence, this is the same movie. In that case, it had to be done very poorly to be a bad movie, since the story it's based on is very good. In fact, the whole first act is flat, at least, and very boring at most. It may be very similar to how the original starts and it may have the same songs. However, it lacks the heart of it. From the moment Will shows up and on, the movie gets much better. I liked the fresh take on the genie's ending on the boat, although I missed the Goofy hat. So, to sum it up, the movie's good and fun, but be prepared to watch a story you already know, probably from memory.",6,1,3,5 June 2019
Coco," Pixar's best film ever
","This is one of the most powerful, emotive movies I've ever watched. A perfect combination of a tender comedy, great music, fantastic world building, an impressive plot twist (foreshadowed excepcionally), and emotional moments (both heartbreaking and fulfilling). I had to fight back tears when I saw the film in theaters, but I couldn't do the same watching it alone at home. It's simply flawless. I want to see Pixar try to top Coco.",9,0,0,25 June 2019
1917," Fantastic film
","Prior to watching this film, I had heard some people complain, saying the cinematography was impressive, but there was no story. I beg to differ. The script of 1917 is great. It basically has the structure of a road movie, in which the hero has to get from point A to point B, while encountering obstacles that increase in complexity at each stop. Everyone of this obstacles is greatly crafted, with great tension and conflict. The journey never feels easy.
The film has some surprising, very emotional moments. The struggle of the hero is real, tangible. It's a fascinating protagonist because nothing can stop him, but we can still see the pain, the suffering and even the fear.
The cinematography is, yes, no doubt, very impressive. But so is the script. I really liked this film and I'd recommend it to everyone who loves a good movie.",8,1,4,29 January 2020
Hotel Transylvania," Very fun
","This movie has it all: a very intriguing concept, that is well executed, characters you learn to love (or at least to empathize with them), and very good comedy, for both kids and adults. I really enjoyed it and absolutely recomend it. My only complain, small maybe, was in the third act, when the monster crew stumbles upon a human monster-fest. This whole sequence felt, for me, unreal. The way the humans acted (protective instead of frightened to the monsters) even if we're watching a parallel version of our world, felt too convenient, and even unnecesary. I think this happens because the writers felt there was a loose end in the character arc, when there wasn't. Most of the movie, Dracula deals with two problems that get mixed: His fear/hate to humans and his inability to let Mavis make her own decisions and give her freedom. When her decision becomes to love a human (right when act 2 begins) the two issues merge into one. And when Dracula decides to go after the kid right into the third act, that's when he's defeated both issues: He's got over the fear/hate of humans by respecting his daughters decisions. Therefore, the whole sequence of the humans protecting him from sunlight becomes pointless. The denoument was, I think, a better moment to add a scene of him interacting with humans, perhaps in Hawaii, emphasizing his learned lesson and showing us that Mavis actually got there, as opposed to having a singing number. Aside from that, the movie was good and is recommended.",7,0,1,20 July 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Good and intense
","The structure of this story is just great. It establishes the main question right in the beggining (who betrayed them?), right after showing us the great relationship of 'friendship' the group has. It keeps you wondering until the third act and, in the mean time, conflicts between the group arise. Just as any Tarantino film, this is a blood fest, non-linear story. The characters feel authentic. They're scared, confused and angry at their situation. They're not clichés. My only concern was how the backstory was intertwined with the main plot. I feel the pace was slowed down every time there was an expositional backstory. Particularly in Mr. Blonde's case, I felt it wasn't necessary for it to be as long (around 8 full minutes to tell us how his relationship with Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. Aside from that, the movie keeps you wanting to know what happens next every second.",7,0,0,27 March 2019
The Disaster Artist," Pretty good
","I started watching this movie without been too sure I wanted to, just because I wasn't in the mood for a film like this. I passed the first act still debating whether I wanted to watch it or not. In that sense, I think it was slightly dull in a few moments, sometimes kinda cheesy (not in a good way), and perhaps too long. But, once I got passed it, the second and third acts were pretty good. They showed the struggle of Wiseau, even if it was in a comedic way. It also surprised me a little they make him such a dislikable character for most of the movie. Having Greg around, it worked, since we could project ourselves in him, and not in Tommy. So I think the film is pretty good, it hooked me in the second act and kept me entertained until the end.",7,0,0,19 October 2019
Steve Jobs," Great
","This is an amazing example of how to write a character-driven story. This movie relies almost 100% on its characters. It happens along three major events in Steve Jobs/Apple life. However, the real story comes from Steve's interaction with the rest of the characters, specially his daughter, Lisa. It's impressive how most of the movie is dialogue and people talking, and yrt it never becomes boring. This is supported by the conflictive nature of the protagonist. It's a great film.",8,0,0,12 February 2019
Love Actually," Good
","I enjoy ensembles. I like the theme of how everyone has a life, everyone has problems, each individual lives their own life main plot, and how everyone turns out to be related. I liked this film because it succeeds in showing that. However, working with a story composed of many equally important plots is no easy task, since there's limited screen time available. And I think that's what ends up affecting Love Actually. I feel some of the plots were rushed, like the one of the Portuguese girl, the one of the guy in love with his friend's wife, and even the Alan Rickman's one . Others even felt unnecessary and that added nothing to the plot, like the ginger guy traveling to America. I liked how the revelations of how each character is related with each other escalate, but it was tough for me to process how at the end everyone knows each other. Overall, the story is good and complies with the basics, but I think it misses in going a step beyond that.",7,0,1,12 March 2019
Joker," Way to craft a character
","Joker's plot id great. It keeps throwing new moments, plot points and scenes that keep the story going forward and moving faster, slowly forging Arthur's path to become what we all know. However, what really stands out in Joker is character crafting. It is no easy task to create a murderer, insane character and manage to make the audience empathize with him, to the point where we suffer when he does. Nobody agrees with what he does, but we understand his actions, decisions, fears... and that is what makes a great protagonist.",8,1,5,1 February 2020
Whiplash," Intense, emotional, nonstop action
","The film deserves all the praise it's got. It's an intense movie that comments on obsession and passion, and shows that masterfully within the story. The plot is very consistent and it never falls in intensity. It also takes some unexpected and fascinating turns that add to the story and help keep our interest. The characters are greatly crafted, particularly Andrew and Fletcher. This leads to us really empathizing with Andrew and understanding his obsession but his feelings as well. In my case, I could feel what Andrew was feeling, due to the great job done scriptwise. The climax is intense. My only, very small complain is one of Andrew's supposed flaws: he can't have friends since e doesn't see the point of it. We comments on that with Nicole and then again with his family at diner. However, we don't really see him refuse to make a friend. He certainly doesn't have friends, but not because he refuses to, but because the other people are jerks. Anyway, that is a very small thing and doesn't really affect the greatness of this movie.",8,0,0,8 September 2019
Stranger Than Fiction," Great idea, the execution could have been better
","I think the movie spends too much time in unnecessary dialogue, and doesn't quite build up for the final climax as it could have.
Also, for me, Harold's death would've been great if the kid he saved had a more important role in the story, either established before the incident or, even better, revealed after. It has been set-up for so long in the movie that the Eiffel's change of mind makes the climax underwhelming and disappointing.
But even the change of mind of Eiffel could've worked if we had been established earlier how important she was in the literary world of the story and how important her reputation was for her. Then, her changing the ending wouldn't only be saving a person's life, but actually sacrificing what she values the most to do it. We see she struggles to find that perfect ending, but we don't see how important it is for her and what she would lose if she doesn't, which means stakes.
The relationship between Harold and his romantic-interest is just too forced. She hates him and then, suddenly she doesn't. And she is not controlled by Eiffel so that wouldn't work as an explanation for it.
The idea is pretty good and there are some nice moments in the story, like when Harold is advised not to do anything in order to see if plot found him. The revelation that the watch didn't hace the right hour was also very good. The first act is pretty good at first, although it then becomes too slow and chatty. The bits of Harold and Dustin Hoffman's character trying to find out who the narrator is and what she's gonna do next are also very entertaining and definitely move the plot forward.",6,0,1,6 December 2019
Parasite," Plot and tension at its best.
","What a great movie. No words. For very long moments I was so immersed that I forgot I was watching a movie. The plot is greatly crafted. It always moves forward and escalates. When the story requires it, the tension is remarkable. I think the father's reason to kill Mr Park could've been established a little clearer, but anyway the movie is great.",8,19,30,22 January 2020
Music and Lyrics," One of my favorite movies ever
","Usually, having a script with too many dialogue, specially with talking heads is an absolute avoid. This film Has a fair amount of that. However, if a film was to break that rule, it would've to be broken just like Lyrics and Music did. The dialogue is fascinating. It's witty, it's funny, it's different with each character... Alex Fletcher and Sophie Fisher would never bore no one. And that's the second strenght of this movie: the characters are just as greatly crafted as the dialogue itself. They're very different from each other, multidimensional, with very clear personalities for each, and so, so authentic. It's so easy to empathize with them that I always find myself feeling what the characters are feeling, and worrying about them. In fact, I'd dare to say Alex Fletcher and Sophie Fisher are two of the most likable characters I've ever seen in a movie. As such, their whole journey is a ton more engaging, because the audience is willing to follow them both anywhere they go. Finally, the songs are great. They heighten the already great script and make this movie one of my tops ever.",8,0,0,23 September 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A masterclass on character arc and theme
","Jojo Rabbit is a fascinating satire that succeeds with its comedy while giving very powerful emotional moments as well. The film stands out for the way Jojo's character act is crafted. His firm Nazi posture is challenged with the natural opposite (having to hide a Jew girl in his house, with whom he ends up falling in love). Every single character in the movie is there for a purpose in Jojo's arc. Jojo's mom, Elsa (the Jew girl), Yorki or even Captain Klenzendorf are there to ultimately push Jojo into challenging his own ideals, and what he believes is right and wrong. Hitler is there as a personification of Jojo's ideals, as well as a resistance to change in his morals. Just as these characters, the plot forces change in Jojo in a subtle, natural and believable way. Whether is his mother's dead or the Nazis losing the war, these situations end up pushing Jojo into his ultimate change.Overall, a great film. I really loved 1917, and I want it to win the Oscar to Best Motion Picture. However, I wouldn't be mad at all if Jojo Rabbit wins. It's a great film and it would be great to see a comedy film win the prize.",8,0,0,5 February 2020
Speed," Magnificent tension building
","The keyword for this movie is non-stop tension. It manages to successfully keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours in a masterfully way. The plot keeps turning and increasing its speed. The struggle for the hero come from all fronts, and it just keeps you hooked.
Even when the movie might abuse a little of the absurd and plot-convenient, and when there are a couple scenes where they could've made the tension grow more (and, just perhaps, make the third act a little shorter), the movie is extremely enjoyable. You won't want to blink, and you definitely won't believe how fast those two hours went.",8,1,1,20 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great!
","I'm not objective on this. I know. I don't care. I love Star Wars. This has all the Star Wars feeling from beginning to end. The plot works. The characters are well defined, are different from each other and feel authentic. The way we're introduce to each of the old classics is exemplary. I love it.",8,6,27,15 April 2019
The Proposal," Good
","After seeing the first act of the film, my expectations lowered significantly. For me, that's the weakest part of the script. We're told many times that Sandra Bullock's character is too mean in the first act, but it isn't showed. The only moment she's mean to someone, that's a lazy employee that actually deserves it. I also found it weird that in the plot point 1, it just suddenly occurs to Sandra that she could marry Ryan Reynolds, with no external output for that idea. The other two acts, on the other hand, were good enough to compensate for it. The third act, specially, was quite good. It was moving, but had enough comedy to keep the tone light. I found the dialogue witty and enjoyed it. Overall, it's not an all time classic, but definitely does the trick for a saturday night.",6,0,0,25 January 2019
