Requiem for a Dream," Extremely Great Film
","This film was extremely great.  It shows us how the world is when it comes to addiction.  This is how we all feel, but we are just too oblivious to the whole situation.  The film does a very good job of showing how these peoples life depend on their addicitions.  I give it a 10/10.  This film should have been nominated for Best Picture, and Jennifer Connely did much better in this that in Beautiful Mind!",10,0,0,31 July 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," This movie rocked over london, and rocked on chicago
","Man....breathless....speechless....quentin took my heart and sliced it up with that dang samuri sowrd.  Me and my girlfriend saw this last night, and we were thouroghly amazed.  I wish more movies were like this.  I don't think half the crap that is out in this world is even half as good as this one was.  Go see it!",10,0,1,12 October 2003
