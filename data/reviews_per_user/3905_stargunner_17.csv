The Ring," Let's get one thing straight! The Ring does its job.
","For those of you who feel all high and mighty because you've seen Ringu and think it's better than The Ring, how would you like to know that The Ring is not even based on Ringu! If some of you would do some simple research or at least watch the other films that have come before The Ring, you'll see that a Japanese film named Ring Virus (or Ring) is almost identical to The Ring, far more so than Ringu. Ringu has a lot of differences in comparison to The Ring, but Ring Virus and The Ring share a virtually identical plot and characters.And at that, i'd like to say they are both superb films! The Ring does a great job at what it's supposed to do - scare the **** out of you. It's a psychological thriller and provides a compelling enough story to drag you in if you let it. As for some of the cultural translations needed to make Samara - a character that is shrouded in Japanese folklore and phenomena - truly horrifying, I think the American version couldn't have done a better job. While some give The Ring the cold shoulder with questions and confusion, I think it's important to come to movies like this expecting things you shouldn't be able to understand or ask questions about. It's called imagination. Suspended disbelief.And if you're really that curious about how Samara can make images appear on videotapes or make phone calls from a well, you can look into it for yourself.The best thing about The Ring is the more you watch it, the more fascinating and terrifying it really is.",10,3,5,28 January 2005
Finding Neverland," Sappy, but definitely not a 'chick-flick' type
","Yes, I am a guy and I found this movie a little too sappy for men's tastes - but don't get me wrong - this is an excellent film. This is not a chick flick. Finding Neverland follows the life of the writer of Peter Pan and how he got his inspiration.Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet both work wonderfully together in this one. I enjoyed most of the film although it can go from charming to tear-jerking at times. Perhaps the movie gave us the hard truth, though. The cinematography is brilliant and truly gives for a magical experience. It's really a movie that will snag at your imagination while at the same time keeping focus on the plot. And all the girls I saw it with were sniffling at the end.It was a little tough for me to wear it through the romantic/relational parts, and I am not going to judge it on that. Great movie. 9/10.",9,0,0,21 March 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A drawn out mess laced with charm and effects
","The much anticipated sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean is finally here, and it's clear that the cast hasn't changed their gameplan. Johnny Depp is still swaggering about, stealing the show with his swashbuckling charm, while Bloom and Knightley keep making their way into Jack Sparrow's plans to repay the debt he owes to Davy Jones.The film runs over two hours, and some things probably could have been cut out, especially for an audience that is used to films under the 120 minute mark. But Pirates has many of twists and surprises for the audience, many of which are reminiscent of the first film. Those who are familiar with the first will notice many references in the first to crack a smile or make a point. Which isn't bad, but it's a little overdone.I was very impressed with the CG in this film, Davy Jones and his crew were always a joy to watch, and the mystical sea creature, the Cracken, was extremely well done. Environments and props were crafted to perfection, and the film draws you in very well in this department. I don't think they could have had a more convincing atmosphere for Dead Man's Chest. But it doesn't make up for the film as whole, which has some issues.Overall the movie looks like a perfect specimen from a far glance, but it has a serious gimp. There are a ton of plot holes, inconsistencies and it's incredibly absurd considering how many characters make returns and how much Dead Man's Chest has to lean on its predecessor to keep itself from stumbling over itself. Some of the magic from the first film is there, but the only thing that has improved are the CG pirates and the sometimes almost mystical environments. The third installment will have a lot of explaining to do thanks to Dead Man's Chest, and I don't know how they are going to keep it under three hours without it making any sense and still have it be as wildly entertaining as the first.Overall it's an enjoyable experience, with laughs here and there, but in the end you're going to be saying out loud, 'what?' Let's just hope that the final installment can patch up the holes and make this trilogy a solid, consistent winner, and make Dead Man's Chest a little more understandable. Perhaps then it will lose its gimp. But for now, I'll have to say the highlight of the film was Davy Jones blasting away at his organ. 6/10",6,3,6,7 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," too surreal for its own good.
","In light of the recent fantasy novel-to-movie wave, I think it's safe to say that they're all a bit over indulged. When the height of realism in computer graphics stops wowing people like it use to, and this fad of film begins to slow, we will look on the Chronicles of Narnia as the weakest of these.All in all Chronicles of Narnia was an average film. Its strongest point was its epic production scale. That couldn't save it at all. Yes, the graphics are stunning, but there's a huge problem with it all. The contrasts, the colors, everything in it that is CG or design is far too bright. Yes, Narnia is a magical, fictional world, but so is Tolkein's Middle Earth and J.K. Rowling's Hogwarts. Their worlds do not make people's eyes bleed. And neither should Narnia. While watching the film everything is simply far too vibrant. Even scenes that should be dark and ominous, like ones with the White Witch and her minions, and scenes of death and battles.It really killed the film for me. Every field was lime green, every tent and garment of Narnia was a lively red and white, brand new and untainted. It made the White Witch seem far less evil than she really was. And the death of Aslan was simply unmoving with a pink and yellow sunset adorning its background.I could go on about it forever, but I'll leave it at this. Just because you're in an imaginary world, doesn't mean you don't have to convince your audience the place is real.Moving on, the acting was alright, but nothing worth noting. The casting was well done, yet at the same time the screen play killed the good choice of actors. I know you have to fit hundreds of pages of a book into a 2 hour film, but it's not like Peter picks up a sword and suddenly knows how to slaughter hundreds of minions of evil. I had trouble playing along with the film in this aspect, too.Some of it was too quick, some if it was too slow. A lot of things were done right, but other things were done wrong. I'm not trying to be negative about this film. I loved the books as a child and one would think I'd have a huge positive bias in favor of this film. Yet in many ways this is a very disappointing movie and unlike most cases I'm going to throw in the towel saying I'd rather be reading the book than watching this film.5/10",5,1,2,6 January 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Scrat easily upstages the prehistoric script of Ice Age 2
","The number one thing you will hear from people about this movie is, 'if it wasn't for that squirrel, it would have been a lot worse.' And they're absolutely right. Scrat is animated proof that dialog is not required to create entertainment. Yet somehow, Ice Age: The Meltdown forgets about it when its attention is diverted back to the main story, which is unappealing to begin with.Like in Toy Story 2, new characters are introduced to the original pack of Manny, Sid and Diego, but they're one step away from total nut jobs and are generally not very likable characters. Supporting cast includes the other animals in the land, most of which are incredibly crude. This movie is chock-full of innuendo and incredibly distasteful dialog that no one from child to adult laughed at in the theater, and was completely unnecessary.The reason why Scrat is everyone's favorite character, perhaps apart from the hilarious and innocent Sid, is because he never speaks, and the dialog in The Meltdown is abysmally poor. There where many parts where a bit of good animation to cue an emotion instead of shoddy dialog would have made this movie insurmountably more entertaining, enjoyable and a downright good film. Yet instead, lame jokes and corny dialog that has the audience's eyes rolling were furiously painted all over this movie.Maybe I would have enjoyed the story and new characters more if it wasn't for all of these circumstances. It seems as though a lot of absolutely stunning animation was put to waste due to B-movie humor and script writing. It's really ashame, because the animation team behind the Meltdown really know what they're doing. Unfortunately, the rest of the film really takes the backseat to the animation in The Meltdown.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone except very young children, or those who are simply interested in seeing some nice animation.3/10",3,5,9,7 April 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," You'll love it or hate it, this is why.
","The Matrix Revolutions brings the mind blowing trilogy to an end. For some, it brought resolution, for others not. Whether or not you are a fan of the Matrix series the most important attribute to Revolutions is being able to understand it. No doubt the effects, albeit stunning, cannot save the Matrix, as we learned in Reloaded. This time around the acting and dialog was infinitely better, however, even these redeeming factors don't fill the gap completely. I loved this film, more than previous two - and is one of my favorites of all time, for that matter - but it's mostly accredited to the fact that I understand what happened in Revolutions. I'm not out to spoil it for anyone, but I have met more than enough of others who have seen this film and don't understand it, as well as do, to see that those who find Revolutions to be nothing but enigmatic hate the film more than all of the three. Consequently, those who have a grasp on what happened enjoyed the experience as much as I did and feel the same way I do.The Wachowski brothers, perhaps, could have portrayed the finale with a little more clarity; but I find it ashame that so many have come to hate this trilogy upon seeing Revolutions. It goes to show how important it is to pay attention to the little details we sometimes disregard in such an action-oriented trilogy as the Matrix. There really is more to it. And once you understand the film, you get to love the rest of it: the action, the characters, the story, even more. 9/10",9,46,89,19 November 2003
The Hills Have Eyes," couldn't take it seriously.
","The Hills Have Eyes is too predictable, too corny and just didn't deliver the thrills that I was hoping for. It goes to great lengths to attempt to disturb you, and there were parts that were unsettling. It fits with the mood of the film, but it doesn't mean I was entertained.Yeah, like a typical slasher/horror there were points of high tension, some great fighting and frightening imagery, but thrills become cheap when a movie isn't good. And this movie felt cheap. The characters are just way too predictable and stereotypical, and the ones that make it are so fake it's unbearable. And to top it off, every time one of the mutants is killed by our protagonists this corny triumphant chorus chimes in, which pretty much destroys the mood altogether.The mutants are well done, yet when they are off-screen and we only hear them it's not very frightening. The characters on screen are just about wetting themselves, and I hear a poor voice-over on screen. This movie had a lot of potential, and it is very clear, but there were things that were done so wrong that the pieces didn't quite fit together.A lot of people are calling this a great horror movie. As a big fan of horror, I can't really see that. I knew what was going to happen to each character as they were introduced and what role they were going to play, the soundtrack belonged in a Mel Gibson film, and was mildly disturbing but not scary at all. It's one of those films you walk away from and just say, 'okay..'",4,0,1,21 March 2006
The Transporter," Patchy at best.
","The Transporter start out very slow. You get an idea of what Statham does in the movie, and that goes on for about a half an hour. Then things start to get interesting, but they only start to. Once you find out what the movies all about it kind of ruins the cool tone it had to it originally. The plot itself is not only bad, but is thrown together, making for a really patchy film. The action is great - but that's all. Even at some points its absolutely ridiculous what is pulled off. I found myself laughing at a few parts. And those weren't the parts I was supposed to be laughing at.Transporter tries to be funny at parts, and it really isn't. It tries to be serious throughout, when really it's just weird. I wouldn't recommend this movie even as an action flick, since most of the action is repetitive and unrealistic. For example, two cars collide and burst into flames before they barely even hit each other. But what bothered me most about this film is the extremely poor music selection. What was left of the Transporter that made it any bit redeeming was ruined by the awful soundtrack. Half of it was hip-hop, when there really shouldn't have even been music. And the score for the rest of the film simply isn't that good and doesn't fit the tone of the movie. All in all it was another disappointing movie rental. I could keep the flick for another week but I returned it the day after. I didn't really want to look at it. This kind of makes me not want to see Transporter 2, but I will still give it a chance.",4,6,12,6 September 2005
Shrek 2," It Will Make You Smile
","I was having an awful day when I went to go see Shrek 2. When I walked out I had forgotten everything bad that had happened that day.I'm not a big fan of the first Shrek - I thought it was a little dry and the story could have been played out better. But this sequel is much better in my opinion. Shrek 2 offers a lot more than the first Shrek. There's plenty of laughs for the kids and adults, and the story is ten times more heartfelt than its predecessor.They throw in new characters as well. The adventurous Puss in Boots - a silly spin-off of Zorro, Fiona's Fairy Godmother - the authority on a 'happily ever after' ending, 'Prince Charming' and much more. Sometimes new characters tend to do a pathetic job keeping a movie series alive, but not in Shrek 2. I was happy to see some fresh comedy along with all the new faces, and lots of hilarious parodies on other films as well. The whole movie I was smiling and having a great time.This is a great date, family, and friends movie. If you're looking for a good time at the theater, or just in general, go see Shrek 2! It won't fail to make your day. 9/10",7,0,0,28 May 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An Incredible journey
","Michel Gondry brings Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet together for a dark, eccentric and powerful film that no one should miss. Their rewarding performance along with the crafted screenplay and twists and turns make this film worth seeing more than once. Most films are so shallow they only last their glimmer for one view. However, Eternal Sunshine is a jewel. The more you see it, the more you get out of it. The entire film is a portrayal of the journey of the mind, life, and the center of its being. A truly inspiring film, and one that should be adored and loved as a centerpiece of this journey. It teaches more than it pleases. While Jim Carrey is a comedy man, he is incredibly apt to take this role. A must-see. 10/10.",7,0,1,4 April 2004
Avatar," Audiences bedazzled by amazing VFX and a terrible screenplay
","I am amazed by some of the responses to this film, especially the people who thought they wouldn't like it. I suppose audiences are still wowed by the same old 3D tricks that vfx studios have been pulling off since the beginning of this decade. The only difference is that Avatar is completely oversaturated with every cg gimmick you could imagine.A tired re-telling of cowboys vs. indians, Cameron treats his audience like simpletons and idiots with a message that couldn't be more in-your-face and oblivious - and just in case you don't understand parts of it, he throws in some unnecessary narration by the main character for good measure. I mean really, the Na'vi couldn't be more stereotypical Native Americans, and the resource on the planet of Pandora is called Unobtanium? Ha ha ha, I get it, unobtainable, wow that's really deep Cameron. I'm moved.I have to give credit to WETA Digital - the studio that brought Cameron's 'vision' to life - for doing an excellent job on the visuals and breaking the uncanny valley (as far as blue lanky 'humanoids' go.) That aside, this film has laughable writing, predictable, boring characters, and a repackaged shame-on-you cheeseball message about raping the earth and white guilt.I really don't understand people's love affair with Cameron and this corny film. At least I can give him credit for being right about the fact that most people still can't see a crappy screenplay through amazing visuals he had no part in. A year from now people will be watching this on their regular TV screens and wondering what they thought was so great about it. Trust me - this movie will only impress in theaters. It has no value beyond mindless entertainment. And as far as the message, you might as well watch Ferngully or Pocahontas and spare yourself the terrifying and ugly designs of the Na'vi.",3,8,22,28 December 2009
Toy Story 2," Not near as good as the first
","When this movie came out the hype generated a lot of positive feeling around this movie, which I think attributes to it generally being rated better than its predecessor. Even here on IMDb's top animation list, Toy Story 2 is far ahead of the first and it has no hopes of catching up.What killed this movie for me was the introduction of strange new characters. I never warmed up to Jessie and Bullseye, and I don't consider The Prospector a very worthy protagonist. The set of new characters don't further the greatness of the first Toy Story, and I felt I had nothing in common with them. I was enjoying Toy Story 2 only when the original crew was on screen, rather than Woody's new friends and enemies.The musical scene was probably the point I realized that Toy Story 2 was not going to live up to the first. Really, If you watch the first again, you'll realize that what the first film was centered around (Buzz and Woody's conflict), was so much more engaging and true then a bunch of psychopathic toys that have been locked up in a box for decades.I'm sure I'm not alone, and it's too late to switch the ratings between these two movies, but I feel they should be. It's not that Toy Story 2 is a bad movie, it's simply not as good as the first.",9,0,2,21 November 2004
National Treasure," How much more formulaic can you get?
","It's safe to say that National Treasure is a box office success. It's not that hard to understand why. Here's the breakdown. You've got your...Reckless yet calm guy driven by some lifelong pursuit (Cage), and his funny tech-guy groupie (Bartha.) Soon enough the lovely lady (Kruger) whom was introduced earlier unwillingly gets involved in reckless yet calm guy's lifelong pursuit.But alas, reckless calm guy's enemy, the Machiavellian shyster (Bean) and his buddies with foreign accents are out to ruin reckless calm guy's day.That pretty much sums up the base of National Treasure. Needless to say the casting and story were fairly well done, but you couldn't ask for something more typical when it comes to mildly-rated action films. It's a mix of James Bond, The Mummy, and The Italian Job. Nicolas Cage didn't bore me to death, I laughed a few times and there was the occasional biting of the lip. Nothing incredible, but surely a good time at the theater. 7/10.",5,0,0,26 November 2004
The Happening," From a first-timer's perspective.
","Let me get this out there before I start - 'The Happening' is the first Shyamalan film I have ever seen.And I have to say that if anyone believes this movie was thoughtful, brilliant or creative, they have to be biased towards what I have been told is Shyamalan's former brilliance in earlier films, because this movie is downright awful.Despite the 'message' the movie may have been trying to subtly shove down our throats (ala the completely unnecessary pan to the chalkboard about how humans would die without bees in 3 years), it fails by quickly transforming from a half-interesting suspense film into a completely awkward and unintentional comedy.I can't even say Shyamalan was making an effort to direct a believably terrifying film - the script is beyond laughable. Every scene that was supposed to be either heartbreaking, terrifying or downright creepy was completely shattered by some mind-numbingly stupid response like 'cheese and crackers!' (usually from the main character Elliot played by Mark Wahlberg, but the provided one is thanks to Jeremy Strong.) I felt as though Shyamalan treated the audience like a bunch of idiots in presenting the concept of this film in the most dumbed down way possible. It spins around in circles, taking itself seriously then suddenly busting out a line like 'You know hot dogs get a bad rap? They got a cool shape.' It's negotiable when this movie jumps the shark, but i'm going to give it more credit than it deserves and say it's when Elliot starts talking to a plastic tree.And if that isn't enough, the movie gives itself away after a grand total of 5 minutes.In conclusion, I don't care who directed this movie, and I don't care what else he has made, it was bad.1/10",1,60,122,26 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Fourth Star Wars Classic
","If there's one thing I've heard about Star Wars since 1999 it's been that Episode I and II don't even come close to the greatness of the original trilogy. And this is very true, those two movies pale in comparison on all levels to episodes IV, V and VI. I had high hopes for Episode III anyway.Wednesday night - 10PM. I arrive at the theater two hours early to hook up with my friends already in the screening room for Episode III. Yodas, Obi-Wans, Padmes and other strange creatures weaved through the aisles. Lightsabers poked up above seats. Anticipation was heating up the room. Literally.It was safe to say that Star Wars fandom had not been swayed at all by the previous two disastrous episodes. Sure, most of the people thought the last two films were epic, but there were typical movie-goers - such as myself - who were lucky enough to come across an opening night ticket. And so, after two and half hours of waiting, a 30 oz cherry coke and some previews, the screen went black. 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...' And the next two and a half hours were equally or more pleasing than finally seeing those words. This movie's mass approval to fans and regulars alike is somewhat due to the fact that Star Wars is one of the biggest things to ever happen in American cinema, but this movie is truly far more superior than the previous two installments, and is a very worthy addition as a prequel to the original trilogy. Every time a situation in the movie would come up that would bring back awful memories of terrible acting in Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones, the cringe would wash away as Sith would perform it ten times more brilliantly than the previous two films.Christensen as Anakin and Portman as Padme finally replace the wood planks that acted in their place in Episodes I and II. Their relationship seems more real and trivial like it should be. Christensen's path to darkness, although predictable in some way, is perplexing in its own sense because you want to know how exactly it happens. And it is interesting and dark. Most of Anakin's journey to the dark side is attribute to this movie's PG-13 rating, and it is disturbing as it is moving. I found myself clenching my fists and even almost to tears at one point in the film.Ewan McGregor stays strong as he has in all films as Anakin's master Obi-Wan Kenobi. As Anakin distances himself from Obi-Wan throughout Sith, you can see the mix of frustration, sadness, anger and sense of defeat and loss Kenobi feels. And everyone else delivers a strong performance. The CG in Sith is incredible as well, and even an improvement from Clones. The fight scenes are breathtaking, and the animated characters, from the ones we know like Yoda and Nute Gunray, to the new ones like the light saber-collecting General Grievous, are all visually stunning and have strong voice acting to back them up.Everywhere that Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones failed, Sith succeeds. It is as good a movie as any of the original, even the most critically acclaimed Empire Strikes Back. You could show this movie to a person who hasn't even seen any of the Star Wars and might find this movie a winner. That's what separates Episode III from I and II. It's a great movie because it does not depend on its cultural value to make its way in the box office. That will attribute to the success of Sith, but anyone will agree that this is definitely a better movie than what we have been seeing lately from Lucasfilm.No, the movie isn't perfect, and I'm not glittering this up in all the hype. This movie deserves 10 out of 10 stars for a lot of reasons. You can't hate this movie unless you force yourself to. It really is excellent. Do yourself a favor and forget about the shortfalls of Episodes I and II when you go see this. It's not worth being nervous for, because Sith will correct everything you think is going to go horridly wrong.In the future, I can see parents showing their kids Star Wars III through VI for a fun movie day, and maybe saving I and II for a day when they're bored and have nothing better to do. This movie also succeeds at bridging the gap between the two trilogies, which will make the movie a worthy addition for those new to Star Wars in the future. And finally, the fans that have been around longer than anyone will probably find themselves with tears in their eyes at the end. Sith is a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga, a fantastic and triumphant ending and a new, true sci-fi classic. 10/10",4,3,8,19 May 2005
WALL·E," Wall-E is more than just a movie
","Wall-E, to me - as an animator - is a lot more than just a movie. I think it represents a turning point in the world of animation. Ever since Disney took a tumble these past couple of years with a lot of misfires, I think people were starting to lose hope in the animation industry.But Pixar has always stood from the crowd. Pushing the boundaries and dodging the conveniences of the 3D, Pixar has treasured the traditions of the old masters of animation and brought them to the new dimension of animation.There's no doubt Wall-E is insanely detailed down to the finest grain. But that's just the icing on the cake to the three things that I think Wall-E will change about animated feature films.First off, Wall-E breaks the stereotype that animated films are just for kids. There's still a strong feeling amongst moviegoers of the opposite. To remedy this, many animated films have simply thrown in a couple cheap innuendos that their parents kids won't get for another five years to get a couple laughs. Wall-E, however, unites audiences of all ages with brilliant staging and acting, and I think it will begin to break the stereotype that animated films are only for children. No matter if you're 9 or 90, the happy and the sad moments were shared by everyone.Secondly, Wall-E proves that you don't need to drop the G rating to make an entertaining film. I don't know if a lot of people do know this, but Wall-E does in fact have a G rating, and I can't remember the last time I've seen a widely released film with one.And lastly, Wall-E demonstrates that acting always triumphs over ridiculously jam-packed and gimmicky scripts. There's hardly any dialogue in this movie, and rightfully so. From every wild action scene to the most delicate detail of animation, not a moment is wasted to convey every range of emotion through acting. And 90% of the characters aren't even humans. I felt more connected to a robot with an eyeball and two fingers than I did with most of the human characters in this film. And that is something that is very precious.If that isn't enough, Wall-E at its roots is simply a ridiculously charming and beautiful film. I recommend it for everyone, and I'd have to say it's my most favorite Pixar film of all time. It's got a great message and is a wonderful escape from a lot of the frantic and often shallow animated features you see today.If you've lost faith in the animation world, let Wall-E bring it back to life.",9,5,11,28 June 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," High rating should come with a warning label
","Don't get me wrong, I understand how this film is considered humorous and well put together for its meager budget, but it being crowned one of the top movies ever made I find myself with my jaw dropped.How is this movie any different from the other purposely stupid comedies like Dumb and Dumber? People who find a liking to Monty Python think that those who don't like it just don't get the humor because it's too intelligent for them. Actually, on the contrary, they do get it and they just don't think it's funny. Monty Python is dumb humor, per se, and there's nothing really unique about it except its setting.If this movie deserves to be in the top 250 of comedy so do films like Dumb and Dumber, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle do as well ... and i'm dead serious. The only reason this film is bumped so high is the thousands of those akin to nerd culture who for some reason highly value the movie come here and give it a 10/10.It's too silly and hollow to be given such a high status. It belongs to a certain group of moviegoers and, quite honestly the majority of people find no pleasure in this type of entertainment. To call it genius or the funniest movie ever made is exaggeration. It's good, but it isn't great; I honestly don't think it was filmed with the intention of making cinematic history.If that's one thing that makes it great, then you can treat it that way. But as far as I'm concerned, the high rating for this film is very misleading. It should come with a warning label:ACQUIRED TASTE.6/10.",7,7,16,24 December 2004
