Ford v Ferrari," it is not just for racing fans, it is for everyone
","Because I am not. However, I enjoyed it fully.Because at its core, it is a universal principle: go after what you believe, you can and will do it. Don't take short cut and don't regret.This is a inspirational movie for everyone, everyone wants to do something out of ordinary. Totally recommend it.",9,1,2,18 November 2019
Us," Am the only one got lost?
","Get out is a good movie because it is not so intense, not so serious but has a good story. I went in this one expecting, if not more, no less.It starts fine, some hint here and there which is quite nice. Then the big moment comes, the bad guys show up. After that, it started go down hill and lot of times I was shouting inside my mind 'what??' and 'how?' and eventually, 'why?' There is something good but got completely buried by the confusing develop of the story.It looks like the movie tries to tell us something grand. But not only it fails to tell us that 'something', but fails to give an even marginal base.By the way, except for the leading actress, all actor's acting was, ok, 'acting'. But I actually understand that, given the materials, you cannot really get a grip on how to 'act'.",4,0,1,2 April 2019
Aquaman," 10 star reserved for the next James Wan DCEU movie
","Aquaman deserves a 10 star by itself. Already watched twice in IMAX (yes, please go watch IMAX version). It is beautiful from the scene, song, story, pace and the imagination, the performance - everything. You can see James' signature surprising moment from time to time.I give a 9 star simply because I believe there is more James can offer and please let him do it.",9,1,3,26 December 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," a movie should be given the oscar
","I will be honest. I lived in US for over 20 years, but I cannot follow completely the dialog, the culture background and some logic in this movie. But felt whole heartedly why the characters in the movies act the way they act. This is the power of the movie, I think it goes beyond language.It seemed so to incomprehensible to a person with modern concept why they are so full of hatred, full of discrimination and always resort to violence to solve their problem. But to me, it is just a indication of how people feel so week inside wanted to be heard. A mom of a victim of crime, a cop with failed grade and low IQ, a midget, a gay agent... They stood their ground, defending their position helplessly and ridiculously, but yet they found (eventually) a peace inside from each other.The depth of emotion that reflects the human nature is so strong that you cannot ignore it. The oscar, as it turns out now that went to the shape of water, should, by comparison, have given to this one. And I think Woody deserves an oscar too.",10,3,9,6 March 2018
Midsommar," would common people react the same way?
","I like the pace of the movie where it slowly introduces the story and gradually build into something, well, not hard to imagine. I wasn't disappointed in the cliche of the plot, but the lack of discovery of human nature in light of the events revealed in front of the characters' eye. The emotions they display are so shallow that keeps me wondering, would people's mind so superficial and naive? I actually anticipated a wake of humanity at the decision making time when there is conflict among the guest characters.",5,1,4,8 July 2019
