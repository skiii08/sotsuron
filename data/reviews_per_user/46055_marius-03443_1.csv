Black Swan," A true masterpiece!
","To be completely honest I was not expecting the movie to be this good. Not only did it show the struggles of becoming successful by not making it cheesy, but it also allowed me to relate to and understand the characters. Really immersive story! Also the whole aspect of mental exhaustion and its visible effects on reality fits this film very well. Really really pleased!",10,2,2,7 February 2019
