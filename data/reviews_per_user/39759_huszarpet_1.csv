Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This is not Kazachstania
","I am a bit disappointed, because i was expecting something more real concerning the Kazach reality. In fact, the only thing, what Kazach was, were the national flag, the names (but those can be any Russian names). All other images from Kazachstania were absolutely nothing to do with Kazachtan. I would expect, that it was filmed somewhere in Ukraine Carpatia region. Kazachs are also mongoloid types, but those faces from the movie were quiet European. (an other minor example are the guys standing on the horses at the end of the movie: a typical scene from the Hungarian lowlands, Central Europe) I think, this is a funny movie, but throws a false image on what the reality is about Kazachs and their country. Nevertheless, the US reality presented in the movie is more to do with what I was expecting from it. So watch with care, Kazachstania is different.",5,2,6,17 December 2006
