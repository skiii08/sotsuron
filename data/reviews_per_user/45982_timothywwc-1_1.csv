National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Great movie for both adult and teen
","I am glad to see a successful Hollywood movie without having to reply on gore, violence or flashy special effect.Great movie! It is very well-paced. There is no downtime.Tell the critics to buzz off! The story is perfect. Hey dumb-ass critics, this is a sequence. It is supposed to make with the same formula as the first one. If you expect something different, go watch AVP2.It is like buying the new U2 releasing album, I don't expect them to sing bluegrass or country.It has no killing, clean humour and I would bring my daughter to the movie",9,13,27,29 December 2007
