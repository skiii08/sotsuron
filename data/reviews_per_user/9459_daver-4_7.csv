The Blair Witch Project," Terror in the Unseen
","I wish I would've seen this before the hype to its foothold.  This is a unique movie, not worthy of blockbuster status, but there you have it---the Internet has surely arrived.  Most of the horror comes from what you hear, not what you see.  I have to give the movie credit from not drowning us in blood and gore, but this 'unseen terror' concept is nothing new if you've seen the original, 1963 version of The Haunting (a far superior, and creepier, movie than this one).  The naive, smart ass kids who encounter their worst fears is also borrowed from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, another movie that came to mind while watching this (especially that ending).  The actors were pretty good, for once the nonstop usage of the 'F' word seemed appropriate (kids scared out of their gourds would probably talk like this). The Marketing team certainly deserves praise for generating such interest in this movie (not to mention the Web Masters).  A movie like this would have never broken out into the multiplexes ten years ago.  Tune out the hype and you may find yourself entranced by the film, as simple and occasionally frustrating as it is.",Null,0,1,24 October 1999
American Beauty," The Movie of the Century?
","American Beauty may well be the last great film of the century, and this is perfectly fitting.  The film, on the surface, examines a dysfunctional family in a 'perfect' suburban environment.  But the film actually wants us to look at ourselves.  Things need to change.  We need to change. Or we will become 'plastic' or 'sedated' like Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey's characters.  The movie is about the dehumanizing effects of 1) repressing feelings and 2) pretending that everything's 'spectacular.'  The only 'real' characters were the daughter (Thora Birch) and the guy next door with his camera.  And they're constantly branded in this film as being 'weird' or a 'psycho.'  The movie really impacted me to the point of actually developing a different outlook on life.  It's that good.  The ending is perfect.  The film borrows from other movie sources like 'The Ice Storm,' 'Happiness,' 'Ordinary People,' and even 'It's a Wonderful Life' and creates something wholly unique, funny and extraordinary.  I doubt I'll see a better film this year.",10,0,0,22 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," Everything You've Heard is True
","I've been anxious to see this movie since watching the preview and I must say I was not disappointed--in fact it has tied with American Beauty as my favorite film of the year.  There are so many layers to this movie, like A.B., that I'll have to see it again.  John Malkovich's participation in the movie is the key to why it's so successful.  I've always viewed him as a slightly overrated actor.  Kind of self-important.  It's refreshing that he must see this as well.  The other actors are just as charismatic.  They must have known that no one has ever done a movie like this before (at least that I've seen in my years). Although the film works on many different levels, the moral is very simple--be happy with who you are.  One movie that I could've watched all over again after it was over.",10,1,2,7 November 1999
Good Will Hunting," Ordinary People, anyone?
","This movie is overrated, predictable and manipulative. There is some quirkiness in the dialogue and Matt Damon does a great job (giving credit to where credit is due), but I can't believe how some audiences and critics view this movie as 'revolutionary.'  First off, the relationship between Damon and Robin Williams echoes, right up to the 'it's not your fault' climax, Timothy Hutton and Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People.  The people in Will Hunting's life who attempt to get through to him--Ben Affleck, Williams, Minnie Driver, etc--was also liberally borrowed from Robert Redford's classic.  As for Williams, the fact he won an Oscar for what is basically a replay of his 'Dead Poet's Society' role is baffling to me.  I'd like to think that Oscar rewarded him for his overlooked dramatic performances in World According to Garp, Moscow on the Hudson, Awakenings and The Fisher King--his performances in all of those films blew his 'GWH' Oscar-winning performance away. Much of this movie is paint-by-numbers (especially the climax).  There were some deeper aspects to Will's life that Damon conveyed with his fine acting, yet they were never explored.  Bottom line:  If the movie had not been described as being 'brilliant' and 'groundbreaking,' my expectations would have been lower.  Put this with 'Rain Man'and 'Terms of Endearment' as one of the most overrated films of the last 20 years.  Give me overlooked, unpredictable character dramas like 'Dominick and Eugene' and 'Birdy' over this one.",4,4,7,2 May 1999
The Legend of 1900," Worth seeking out
","It would be wonderful if this movie eventually finds its way into the multiplexes, the way Life Is Beautiful did last year.  But somehow I doubt it....the studio seems to have little hope for it because of its overseas reputation.  A shame because it's yet another fine addition to 1999's list of thoughtful, challenging movies.  It is inevitably being compared to Titanic, if only because of its setting (ocean liner in the early part of the century).  The film has more in common with Fellini than Cameron (viewers who have been disgusted with the film's visuals and sentiments seem to have forgotten why we go to movies in the first place).  The scenes are slightly surreal and always fascinating.  The delivery of the dialogue is a bit stilted, especially by the actor who played Max, but Tim Roth is a talented actor and makes the most of it (especially during his final, impassioned speech at the end).  No surprise that this was made by the director of Cinema Paradiso.  Both films are presented primarily in flashbacks, both have a romantic feel, and both deal with an amazing, unexpected friendship.  Definitely worth checking out.",8,0,1,19 November 1999
The Green Mile," All emotions in check
","Another 1999 movie that combines several different genres--human drama, suspense, occasional comedy--and takes its viewers on an emotional rollercoaster.  You really have to be a machine not to feel something after watching it.  This one goes a step further and introduces another genre--sci fi/fantasy--into the plot.  After all, it's based on a Stephen King story. The film is being compared to Shawshank Redemption by everyone, but that film was more romantic in its handling of the characters and the events.  Do hardened prisoners really get that captivated by an opera?  Green Mile is more hard-edged and realistic, especially in the end.  The irony is that the film has so many fantastic elements....think of John Travolta in Phenomenon. My only complaint is the ending.  Without giving away too much plot, I think the fate of one of main characters could have been handled differently.  Tom Hanks and James Cromwell's character could have intervened, since they saw the 'miracles' right in front of their eyes.  A retrial could have been arranged.  Then I guess we would've had a 4 hour movie instead of a 3 hour one.  Still an excellent film, and the first movie to generate so many emotions from an unlikely source--a mouse!",Null,0,0,1 December 1999
The Waterboy," Too familiar for me
","This movie cries out 'Farrelly Bros, Farrelly Bros., Farrelly Bros.'  And not There's Something About Mary as much as Kingpin.  Even flashback sequences, with '70s hair styles for Henry Winkler and Jerry Reed, a'la Bill Murray in Kingpin!  Adam Sandler is the best thing about this (Kathy Bates overdoes it, in my opinion--'fussball' and the devil references get old after 2 times!) He was appealing in Wedding Singer and is appealing here as he spoofs Forrest Gump.....glad I didn't see this at the theater.....for those who loved this movie, check out Kingpin if you haven't (I was the only one in the theater when I saw that movie originally).......that movie bombed, Waterboy broke $100 million----no one can predict if these flicks succeed with audiences.  Let's hope Sander does something more along the lines of Wedding Singer for his next role.",Null,1,1,23 May 1999
