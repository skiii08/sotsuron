Casablanca," Wonderful
","I had never seen this film until very recently, however, I can surely say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. Although it is certainly a classic romance, the fact that such a serious even was occurring around it made it a lot darker than romantic movies commonly are. I thoroughly enjoyed the use of black and white in this film, as well. Arthur Edeson did a wonderful job making sure that the way this film was shot, really captured everything that was going on around them. Flashing back when Rick and Ilsa were together and madly in love, the tones were so much lighter than the present time heartbroken and troubled pair. When Rick is sitting alone in his café listening to Sam play 'their song,' there isn't a single light directly on him. The brightest lights in that scene came from the cars passing by outside the bar. This film was so incredibly beautiful, and so beautifully shot, I can certainly understand the common hype about it. Here's to looking at you, kid.",10,1,3,9 March 2016
Taxi Driver," You talking' to me?
","Another seminal classic that's been discussed way beyond the point of my input being of any importance. What I will say though is this- if you don't get the hype around either Scorcese or De Niro, then let this change your mind. For me, the real strength of this film is its unrelenting darkness- it's a true horror film in my view and, as a character study, I think it's one of the finest pieces of cinema that I've seen to date. Also, a quick shout out to the score which provides a gritty jazz backdrop which only serves to further the chill that this film will leave you with. Why not a perfect 10? I'd say that the film is pretty slow-paced and, whilst the payoff more than delivers, you may find your patience tested a little bit in the meantime.",8,0,2,13 May 2016
Annie Hall," If I never saw another Woody Allen film for the rest of my life, it wouldn't be long enough
","If you like incessant complaining, and 'witty' banter that you need to watch in slow motion in order to understand, then 'Annie Hall' is the movie for you! A movie that's busy trying to prove to you how damn intellectual Woody Allen is. I enjoyed Diane Keaton's neurotic character, but that's about it. I would not classify this as either comedy or romance. It's an ode to the narcissist New Yorker. I will give some credit to Allen, despite my loathing. The camera work in this film, portraying the true grit and raw beauty of New York City, and the beautiful sunset on the beach. It was nice to be taken away from the nightmare that was watching the actual film. All-in-all, the most surprising thing about Annie Hall, is how it managed to win an Oscar for Best Picture.",1,2,6,13 May 2016
The Graduate," Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
","Not only is this an amazing piece of editing and cinema in general, but it also brings a showcases a outstanding performance by Dustin Hoffman. Ben gives the audience a relatable protagonist that we want to see overcome his struggles. Mike Nichols directs with his best foot forward and makes a movie that has and will hold up. The true genius of this film, however, is cinematographer Robert Surtees. The '180Â° rule' shots he uses during the conversation scenes, the quick cuts, and the amount of time he put into doing it all really shines through. Even if this movie didn't have brilliant actors, actresses, and dialogue, it would still be just as incredible all because of the camera work.",Null,0,0,13 May 2016
Singin' in the Rain," Entertaining
","Although I wouldn't call this film Oscar worthy, it was definitely one that captured my attention. The quick witted humor between Don and Cosmo, as well as the adorable romance between the Hollywood beau and the up-and-comer were entertaining, to say the least. I do however, believe this movie is both wonderfully simple and highly overrated. Yes, the musical numbers are outstanding, the singing and dancing are great, the cinematography looks beautiful, and there's some memorable sequences, but overall, this feels rather light. But, it did irritate me that most of the musicals numbers weren't really there to serve the story or move things forward, but just pass the time. I will say, that Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's direction is flawless. Rather than the quick cutting and intense camera movement which is supposed to create more excitement but is really just proof of the director's lack of confidence, Kelly and Donen are content to simply enjoy the spectacle of each amazing set-piece. Their restraint is on display throughout the entire film, trusting that the audience is feeling each moment without the need for explicitly telling them.",6,2,4,10 May 2016
Pulp Fiction," Understanding the hype
","Probably Quentin Tarantino's most known and popular film, Pulp Fiction weaves together several stories and characters in a non linear order, in fact no order at all, and mixes bloody violence, pitch black dark humor, witty and genius dialogue, and amazing characters into one of the most influential movies of all time. a brilliant movie that really isn't for all people, but should be seen by movie buffs around. The star studded cast was overwhelming at first, and the dialogue was amazing. But personally, the star of the show was Uma. I could watch the diner scene over and over again because of how well she plays her role.",6,0,3,13 May 2016
To Kill a Mockingbird," Almost as good as the book
","This was some bold subject matter, and it is semi-autobiographical. The movie came out two years after the book, and the fact that Civil Rights was still going on is why this was all such a big deal. What really shows the risk factor, is how such a divisive issue is shown through the eyes of Scout, and not Atticus. It's a great idea, and really gives some thought provoking insight by framing such a big issue through the eyes of a young, precocious child. This also serves as a great way to educate children on the issue. The performances all around are brilliant. The kids are great and likable (which is quite a rarity), Robert Duvall makes a stunning film debut, Brock Peters is agonizingly sympathetic and compelling as Robinson, and then we get the man who really shines above all: Gregory Peck. This was a much deserved Oscar winning and career defining performance for him, and it really is one of the greats. He's wonderful through the whole thing, and he comes off as the kind of dad a person would love to have as their own. What seals the deal though is his lengthy courtroom monologue. I get all kinds of shaken and emotionally stirred up every time I watch that scene. It's some of the most powerful, riveting, and memorable acting ever put on film.",8,0,0,10 May 2016
