The Avengers," The Avengers - a ,,SMASH,, success ( Minor Spoilers! )
","The Avengers have been Assembled, and with great success. Marvel did all the forework flawlessly, all the Superhero movies leading to this 1 make sense now, small bits in those movies are directly or indirectly tied to this one. The Director / Writer: Joss Whedon - did a great job with all the characters, he took some bits out of the old movies and connected the dots, brought out the best in each and all of the characters. The Cast: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) - he was / is and will be the best choice to play IronMan, he just takes the character to a new level. Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) - was great in Captain America, is absolutely great in this one, i feel like he can play any superhero, he is just the superhero ,,type,, I liked the old costume a bit better but this does not stop the Cap. being the Cap. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) - The God of Thunder...what about that, he feels like the God of Thunder this time, his swing got meaner ( since his ,,Solo Movie,, ) and he swings a lot. Hulk/Bruce Banner ( Mark Ruffalo ) - The unstoppable Force / the Green Rage Monster - oh my: what can i say here - Mark Ruffalo is the best HULK, he ties the absolute HULK: TV's Lou Ferrigno, who gives his voice to the big guy this time ( as he did in all HULK ,,Solo,, movies ). CGI work on HULK is absolutely Fantastic. I feel that Ruffalo plays the clumsy but genius professor Banner better than the others before him ( Eric Bana / Edward Norton ) and this time THE HULK can SMAAAASH ( 4 real ). Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is a nice addition to the Avengers Team ( he had a short appearance in THOR before ), i feel that he is a bit of an outsider in this one, maybe not that much screen time, but overall he just fits in nicely. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) finally we get a peek in her story outside of the Avengers, she does that catlike fighting that we loved in IronMAn 2, she has some psychologically gripping moments in this one that i loved even more than the fight scenes, nicely done. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury has a dominating presence in this one - we finally see the mastermind / spy / agent finally in work, and he works his ,,magic,, well. Clark Gregg as Agent Caulson is back and he brings not only the comic character but the bad-ass Agent with a ,,punch,,. A nice addition is Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill. Last but not least: Tom Hiddleston as Loki the main villain - Thor's brother ( ,,he's adopted,, ) - He is the absolute villain, played so amazingly by Middleston that he levels the the other characters in each and every aspect, he just balances the movie out - some of his scenes are fantastic.Now to the movie - i guess i can call it the best Superhero Team movie of all time. If u are not familiar with the other MARVEL movies u will not feel like an outsider, this is a Superhero Movie on it's own and a fantastic one. The pace of the movie does not feel to fast and to slow either, script and dialogues are all in place. The Movie has some of the most hilarious comic scenes ever put in any action ( or even some of the recent comedy ) movies, the synergy between the main characters is perfect in any way. Some of the fight scenes will blow you out of your seats, i had some moments that i really wanted to just jump up - or rewind and watch again. Every character has his moments ( or a few great ones) the team-fight scenes just take this to a whole new level. The CGI and FX are just what we are used from Marvel movies, and even upped a bit in this one. Set designs and costumes are also high quality, the design of the HELLICARIER, the MAcH7 suit is fantastic, i really liked Loki's outfit as well. Sound and Music department also did a great job, Alan Silvestri delivered again, the music really captures the mood of the movie.Finally The Pro's: The assemble cast. The character interaction. The Hulk. Black Widow interrogating Loki. The SMAAASH Moments ( a lot of them ). The after credit scene. The Con's: 1 thing - this is not a 3D movie - it has it's moments but if u can avoid watching it as 3D u will not miss a thing.Rating: 8.5 / Fan-boy Rating 9+",9,3,9,27 April 2012
