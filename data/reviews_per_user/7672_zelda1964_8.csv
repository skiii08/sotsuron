The Mask," Slapstick comedy that makes the world fixable
","Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) is a zany comic who adds fun to any role he plays; Cameron Diaz (Head Above Water)is a wonderful talent in many films.In The Mask,we find Ipkiss(Carrey),getting bored with his everyday ho-hum bank job;On a chance,Stanley finds this mask that reaches inside to bring out retribution for the world's hard luck.As it happens,Diaz plays the lounge singer Ipkiss falls in love with.Dorian,a co- worker at the lounge,gets upset when Ipkiss (as the masked hero) averts his threat to steal all the savings.The cutest character is Milo,who plays Stanley's lovable pooch.I call this a marvelous film that really tickles the clichÃ©d 'funny bone'.Bravo and cheers!",7,0,0,7 December 2012
Walk the Line," The Man in Black meets his toughest match
","I saw this great film, and I thought it was a moving work of inspiration. Joaquin Phoenix plays a tough role as the 'hard as nails' legendary persona, John R. Cash. As a great fan of country/western music, I love the spirited scenes of laughter and song. What is so heartbreaking and terrible, is that sense of abandonment and loneliness I felt John had hidden within his own heart. As surmised in the film,Cash has a father who left him and his brother without a role model, or any male guidance in Life.I thought that the disappointment his father felt for him cut him deep, and hurt. It is heart wrenching and moving,seeing this mature man pitifully beg like a child for his daddy's affection and approval.I also felt that the death of his brother Jack took away that sense of comfort, and shared 'bonding' John felt as a child.Reese Witherspoon is memorable, as solid rock June Carter. Carter is the wall of strength and courage John needs in facing the 'haunting' demons of his past. In the overview of the film, it is her songwriting talent that brings them fame and wealth.We see how tenderly June loves him, but also how she never backs away from his bearish behavior and wild ways.It is her critical quote, 'you'll never walk that line', that becomes the main focal point of this biography.I recommend this film, and think it is a lesson of how great Love works in a Family.",9,0,0,25 February 2006
Footloose," a great film to swing to
","In the early days of the South,we found prejudice. People were Conservative and critical of things. The movie sheds light on partiality.Just as I am critical of today's music style(do not like rap,which is popular) many people were critical of Elvis Presley and disliked His dancing and performanceThe focal point of the movie is a bringing to light the issues of personal taste and popular culture. I enjoyed the dancing (Bacon and Penn were really cool)i feel that there is an issue of personal freedom that the movie brings up. I feel that freedom of expression is a basic right we need to preserve and protect. If it was a factual movie, then the director brought up issues that we see in today's society.",Null,1,4,4 March 2004
2012," One thrill ride of a Lifetime
","I think there are many subtle hints, to the direction our Planet is heading.Writer Jackson(Cusack)discovers this radio character(played by Harrelson of Cheers fame).Through the announcement,there is an 'earth shattering' message that government is selfish and greedy. Jackson, a divorced father, heeds the doomsday signal and tries to save his family from the forthcoming apocalyptic doom.Through earthquakes and flooding,it seems our planet faces the worse 'wrath' of horror.I enjoy the heart pulsing scenes of this film,and love the crazy action and drama. With a cast that includes Danny Glover as U.S. President Johnson,this film takes the viewer for one amazing 'ride' Cheers and bravo, for this awesome movie!",10,1,2,11 July 2011
Schindler's List," The horrors of History Retold
","In today's society, I feel that prejudice still exists in some form or another. I saw this film and was fascinated by the script Mr. Speilberg played out. What was interesting was the change of heart played out by Mr. Neeson. Here we see Schindler, who had a hatred for so long,suddenly gain conscience and then turn 180 degrees to be compassionate and caring. Mr. Kingsley had a great part as the assistant and friend.If one asks for an educational film to teach about History, this movie is a great one.",10,9,13,21 August 2003
Quiz Show," The glory of Television
","During the 'Golden age',Stemple(Turturro)and Van Doren(Fiennes),are characters that have a match in a widely popular game show;It seems that Stemple is jealous and needs money.He charges that the officials had promised him great riches by giving answers.When Van Doren takes the throne,he goes along with the fun and lives 'high on the hog';It seems that this lack of intelligence would not befit a college professor,as his father acknowledges.With a vast array of sponsorships,the station seems a bit nonchalant in their practice.Van Doren carries a heavy weight and in the end,a confession lifts the burden from his heart.",7,1,1,14 March 2012
Titanic," A great Historic Drama Unfolds
","This film has perfect theme music and suspenseful action; We note the reflection of Rose(Stewart) whose special memories of that fateful day in 1912, take us back in time. Love is special for younger Rose(Winslet),who shows us passion and feelings a Heart cannot hide.She is bound to a man she does not love and meets a stowaway artist. Jack(handsome DiCaprio),unknowingly wins his destiny on the glorious 'ship of Dreams', and meets the high class young girl who changes his luck.Cal(played by talented Billy Zane),makes us see the green side of Envy. All his money is not enough to keep the heart of his beloved, and he desperately tries anything to change her.He is a coward and hides away in a Lifeboat,when the time for manpower is needed.There is the stuffy nature of young Rose's mom; She looks at Jack with hate and loathing, and does not want to lose the fortune because of a Stray 'commoner'.I thought this movie had great effects that put the viewer up close with Horror of the story; The tense struggle makes the heart race faster.",9,1,2,27 October 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," A Powerful Film
","I enjoyed this film because it shows the way I believe our Judicial system should be;tough, and stern. The two main characters,Red and Andy, form a friendship bond that carries them through the ordeal of prison life. They stick together and help one another.The great scene I enjoy, is when Red comes up for parole and the last time, they set him free. The officials may have thought He served his time enough, and He was older anyway.Red gave a great speech, how he regretted what he did and was very sorry.When he said he would 'talk some sense' into that guy who committed that crime,I think that moved the officials to change their minds.Morgan Freeman is wonderful in this film and I love Robbins' performance,here.",9,0,1,3 September 2004
