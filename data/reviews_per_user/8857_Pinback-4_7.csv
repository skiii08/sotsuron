The Blair Witch Project," Reasonably tense mock documentary horror film
","Having been as curious as anybody else over the buzz this film has been generating ever since Sundance, I went to see it on opening day to see what the fuss is all about.  Some critics said that it's the scariest movie they've ever seen, even scarier than THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE EXORCIST.  Well, I wouldn't go THAT far.  This movie is extremely well-made and well-acted, and the filmmakers certainly deserve credit by stretching their shoestring budget extremely well.  The film is shot entirely with a video camera and a 16mm black and white film camera.  The woods where the three ambitious young filmmakers go to explore the Blair Witch legend are claustrophic and creepy.  The film borrows inspiration from many horror films such as THE EVIL DEAD, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, DELIVERANCE, FRIDAY THE 13TH, and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. The difference here is that there is virtually no blood or gore on display, which will no doubt disappoint some viewers.  The emphasis is on the characters' psychological and mental deterioration as they get lost deeper and deeper in the woods.  The only complaint I have about the film is that it doesn't really pay off by the conclusion.  It builds a reasonable amount of tension, especially during the nighttime scenes, and we keep waiting for some big revelation, and we don't really get it.  Time and again scenes keep building and toying with us, and we expect to jump out of seats by something scary, but it never happens.  It's like watching a porno movie without any sex scenes.",7,0,1,5 August 1999
Scarface," Gangster classic that was years ahead of its time.
","SCARFACE is one of the all-time great gangster films.  This is a movie that, like BLADE RUNNER, was considered garbage when first released, but now considered a cult classic.  It was easy to see why the critics hated it so much back then.  It contains excessively brutal violence, foul language, and a lot of drug use.  Everything in this movie is excessive, in fact, including the running time.  This is because Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone don't want to glorify drug kingpins like Tony Montana, played by Al Pacino in an all-out performance that should've gotten the Oscar.  There is good acting by others, especially Steven Bauer as Montana's partner.  He has the funniest scene in the movie in which he demonstrates his unique method of picking up girls.  A small but key performance is given by Paul Shenar as Sosa, Tony's Bolivian connection.  All of the male actors, in fact give believable performances:  Robert Loggia, Harris Yulin, F. Murray Abraham. It is the females who bring down the film a bit.  Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first significant role, seems too wooden.  Her most important last scene in the restaurant lacks conviction.  A little better is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's little sister, but her character draws unintentional laughter because of her mushroom cloud hairstyle.  Their screen time is limited, though, and don't ruin the film.",9,0,0,27 January 2000
Armageddon," Fun as long as you check your brain at the door.
","I enjoyed this movie even thought I'm getting tired of these kinds of movies always taking up 15 screens at a 20-screen theater.  It does the job it says it will do, the effects are adequate, and the characters are funny.  I strongly advise that you take some aspirin before and after you see it, because this movie is a pounding assault on the senses.  I'm glad I didn't see it in a theater because everyone I talked to said that it was way too loud.  I laughed when I read that Disney executive Joe Roth said that they probably wouldn't have made this movie if they would've known how expensive it was going to cost.  I think what he MEANT to say was that they wouldn't have made it if they knew it was only going to make 200 million dollars in the U.S., because that was probably how much it cost.  No doubt they were expecting a $300+ million super blockbuster like 'Independence Day' or 'Jurassic Park'.  Poor babies.  Oh well, I don't think Bruce Willis or Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer will be out of work any time soon.  It's too bad Bruckheimer doesn't produce thoughtful movies like 'Thief' anymore.",7,0,0,15 August 1999
American Beauty," Funny and heart-breaking tragicomedy of '90s America.
","I was somewhat surprised that this film is ranked #1.  I don't think it's THAT good, but certainly one of the best film of this year.  However, it does fall shy of last year's HAPPINESS, which it resembles in some ways. The lead acting by Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening is nothing short of perfect, as are the supporting roles.  Spacey plays a burned out yuppie, strangely remniscient of the Edward Norton character in FIGHT CLUB, who's tired of his job, his wife, and his life.  That is until he meets his daughter's pretty Lolita-like friend.  Bening is a real estate agent who will do almost anything to get ahead.  There are also some strange neighbors who move in next door.  These plot threads overlap and intersect each other, leading to the inevitable conclusion.  This film is a remarkable achievement in part because the writer and director are both making their debuts here, and it's possible they might walk off with Oscars in March.  This film is not for all tastes, though, but most good movies nowadays aren't.",9,0,0,18 November 1999
Apocalypse Now," A modern masterpiece that basically says 'war is hell'.
","Coppola's much-discussed epic Vietnam film, inspired by 'Heart of Darkness', holds up great after 20 years.  The new DVD version looks and sounds great, but I expected the aspect ratio to be wider.  As everyone who has seen the film knows, it is an unforgettable odyssey of alternately surreal, beautiful, and at times shocking images.  Many veterans have complained that the film isn't realistic, but that isn't the point.  The point is in all the set pieces throughout the film, starting with Martin Sheen's drunken binge in the hotel room.  The message is simply 'war is hell', so it doesn't really matter that Coppola couldn't decide on an ending.  Besides, 'the point of the journey is not to arrive...'",10,0,0,26 November 1999
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best war films ever.
","When I first saw this film a year ago, I was completely blown away.  I knew people who had seen it said the battle scenes were pretty intense,  but it was nothing like I expected.  I was in a state of shock as was everyone else at the screening I attended.  The two extended battle scenes that open and close the film are, simply, the greatest battle scenes ever recorded on celluloid.  The primary reason is because they show absolutely everything. Blood, body parts, gore, you name it.  This is easily the most violent film I've ever seen.  Can you imagine what the reaction would've been like if this movie came out at the same time 'The Wild Bunch' did?  I was somewhat surprised that this film sailed through with an 'R' rating.  The film tells a fairly straightforward story of a platoon of soldiers led by Tom Hanks who are assigned to find and bring back a young soldier whose three brothers have been killed in action.  The characters are sharply and simply drawn, the editing is phenomenal, the cinematography is excellent, and the score is appropriate.  This is Spielberg's fourth WWII movie, and arguably his best film ever.  The only complaint I have about this film is its continued absence on DVD.  Please, please, Mr. Spielberg, get this masterpiece out on DVD real soon.",10,0,1,15 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Strange but well worth watching.
","Kubrick's final film is a mesmerizing odyssey consisting of dreamlike images.  It was also not what I expected.  I was very surprised that a huge star like Tom Cruise agreed to do this film, because there is nothing at all commercial or mainstream about it--it is an arthouse film from beginning to end.  In fact, if it had been any director other than Kubrick, I'm sure he would've turned it down.  I'm glad he did it, though, because I was getting tired of his clean-cut crusader roles he's played throughout the '90's. This is his first difficult part since 'Born on the Fourth of July'.  The story takes place in New York City, even though, of course, it was shot in England.  The photography, by Larry Smith, is outstanding.  This is Kubrick's most beautifully shot film other than 'Barry Lyndon'.  Since the film is set during the Christmas holidays, there is great use of color throughout, especially from the numerous Christmas trees we see in just about every indoor location.  No wonder this film took forever to shoot. The story of the film isn't of great importance--what is important is the atmosphere, especially the amazingly surreal sequence at the mansion, which is the film's centerpiece.  There are darkly funny moments scattered throughout.  Although the film is long at some 2 hours, 40 minutes, it felt about a half hour shorter.  Like all of Kubrick's films, it's never boring, but many mainstream moviegoers will no doubt think so, especially Tom Cruise fans.  I was angry that the film was altered for American release but that the rest of the world gets to see the original version.  Let's hope DVD will set the record straight.",8,0,0,3 August 1999
