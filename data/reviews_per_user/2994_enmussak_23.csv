Saturday Night Fever," OK
","Its good that film has a documentation of the disco era, and this is the definitive disco movie.  However, it just isn't that great of a movie. First of all, Travolta's character is a joke.  He could have had more depth. I just can't get into a love story when I know nothing about what's going on with the characters.  There was no connection between me and them, and I found myself sitting patiently through the plot-based scenes to see more dancing and musical montages.  7/10.",7,0,1,25 December 2002
Alien 3," gag me with a spoon
","During this movie I found watching the inside of my eyelids much more appealing.  Something was just plain wrong about the whole movie.  The biggest problem was that I didn't care about any of the characters but Ripley.  This film was made in between the use of actual puppets and good computer animation (which is still obvious).  That means that many times the Alien looked very fake.  I thought the monster was more realistic in the original Alien.Nothing was suspenseful of scary about this movie.  The Alien point of view ruins the mystery and suspense of the Alien.  I don't want to see what the Alien is seeing, what's the fun in that?  I don't want to know where its going, I just want to be surprised.  Also, Ripley crashing on a planet of double Y chromosome rapists was immediately lame.  Also, the doctor's little sob story made me wanna stop the movie right there.  This movie had all the elements of a cheezy blockbuster, an embarrassment to the series.  Because of this film, I'll probably never rent Alien: Resurrection.  I can't even imagine the far-fetched, pathetic way Ripley comes back.  I heard that Jeunet directed that film without knowing how to speak English to the cast.  As the Godfather and Star Wars series' pointed out, three's a crowd.  This is not an exception.  6/10",6,725,946,20 December 2002
Spartacus," Good
","First off, any movie with Olivier and Laughton in two major roles has to have some redeeming value.  They are two of the finest actors I've seen on screen and they lit it up in Spartacus.  Yes, Gladiator ripped off Spartacus in many ways and then turned it into a melodramatic circus.  For the critics of this film, you have to give it the credit of being realistic unlike Braveheart and Gladiator which were poorly done.This isn't a real Stanley Kubrick film so don't go into it thinking you're going to see something innovative and ground-breaking.  This is just a movie.  Kubrick inherited the movie and the script mid-production (I think the story goes) and wasn't super pleased with the result of this film. Too many people were pulling him too many ways.  I missed the homosexuality references, but that's probably because they were disguised and I wasn't looking for them.  Sadly, I'll probably never watch it again.  Very long film, but worth a viewing.  8/10",8,1,3,27 December 2002
12 Monkeys," great potential, but big flaws
","Now, I thought this movie was good and I suggest seeing it.  It is very entertaining.  However, several things detracted from my ability to really get into the story (which was very good).  I'll see anything by Gilliam... you know its going to be something interesting.1)Brad Pitt's acting.  Come on, Brad... your character can't be THAT crazy? I would have appreciated a little more subtlety to his insanity.  This led the viewer not to take his character seriously (let alone a global threat). His acting was very over the top and ineffective.  Four years later he figured it out in Fight Club... in which he was superb.  Unless he makes some horrible career moves, Pitt will be remembered as one of the premier/bad-boy actors of this period in film.  2) The ending... just flat out bad and melodramatic.With some fine tuning, I believe 12 Monkeys could have been right up there with Seven or Silence of the Lambs as a great film of the 90's.  However, it just isn't.",7,14,22,13 December 2002
Mississippi Burning," Powerful film, emotional manipulation
","There have been few films that played with my emotions like this one (Lynch's Elephant Man and The Green Mile are a few others).  Seeing this film just makes you angry... the characters are deep and the setting is ridden with conflict.  This whole film is set in tension between Black and White culture, and the FBI vs. local authority.  Many times I was asking myself, 'can the FBI step in here?  What is their jurisdiction?'A brief homage to Gene Hackman.  He is one of my favorite actors and I have yet to see him in a role that he has not performed masterfully.  The whole time you knew that he was just a little smarter than Dafoe's 'by the book' methods.  The way Hackman made that subtly apparent is very admirable.  I loved Hackman and Dafoe together in this film.  I really, really got into it.  9/10",9,3,4,25 December 2002
12 Angry Men," Heated deliberation
","SPOILERSWhat is great about 12 Angry Men is its very basic structure while keeping you engaged in the flow of the deliberation.  Nearly the entire movie was set in a jury room during a discussion of a murder case.  Henry Fonda has a nagging feeling that the kid is not guilty and has to argue masterfully to convince his fellow jurors (some are harder than others).  What makes this film great is the same reason people like to see comeback wins in sports and why impartial sports viewers tend to root for the underdog.  Throughout the whole film, you have a feeling that Fonda is going to win, but seeing him do it is exciting.  When I watched this movie, it seemed 30 minutes long and my friend and I were getting vocally excited about Fonda's quest for justice. This film is  worthy of all its praise and has aged wonderfully.",9,0,1,16 December 2002
Alien," scare tactics
","MILD SPOILERSI don't think however old this film gets, that it will fade anytime soon. Yes, at first I had to work to get myself into the late 70's sci-fi spaceship sets, but towards the end I could have cared less.  I got the bejesus scared out of me because of the masterful working of suspense and shock.  This is not an action movie, it is a consciously paced thriller.  If it were an action film it would not have been nearly as successful.  Because of the lulls in excitement, the environment seems much more real.  I also enjoyed the initial introduction to the Alien 'breeder.'  The viewer is just as confused about this strange creature as the crew.  With that, the film never stops building.  If you really think about the film after viewing it, Alien's suspense builds stepwise throughout the whole movie piece by piece with new events and information.  Well crafted.  9/10",9,0,1,18 December 2002
American Pie," Pie-uhl of laughs
","When American Pie was in the theaters a couple years ago it was then the king of shock movies.  They took the overdone sophomoric teenage sex obsession and made it fresh and funny.    This film is like a sexual Jackass.  American Pie is still relatively funny, but it needs its shock value which will be lost as time drags on.  Its still a hoot.  Quite a hoot.",8,0,0,17 December 2002
Aliens," one of the best sequels ever
","Alien and Aliens are two very different films.  I agree with another reviewer in saying that Alien is a psychological thriller, whereas Aliens is more of an action movie.  Both are highly successful at what they try to accomplish.  Personally, I prefer Alien because it scared me much, much more.  There were greater breaks in the action in Alien and the monster was seen much less (putting the viewer in the same uncertain state as the crew). Aliens is particularly interesting because we learn more about the life cycle and behavior of the creatures.  The addition of the little girl could have turned into something horrible, but Cameron pulls it off and makes a stellar film worth seeing.  However, I would recommend that you see Alien first to give you background into the creature and to connect what happens at the beginning of Aliens with previous events.  8/10.",8,0,0,20 December 2002
American History X," An important part of our history
","Powerful is the best way to describe American History X.  It is one of those films that benefits greatly from its subject matter.  Few people encounter such overt racism in their everyday lives, and this film serves as an important reminder about the dangers of such beliefs.  In the past 5-10 years, America pulled itself out of its 'PC' era which means anti-racist thinking is on the way out, only to be replaced by something more honest and instinctual (much better in my opinion).  When's the last time you heard the word 'prejudice?'  I never thought that would be a buzzword, but it is.American History X serves to remind us of the pockets of anachronistic racism still living in the U.S.  How prevalent these beliefs used to be still amazes me, and film exhibits no exception.  Check out Spike Lee's Bamboozled for a shocking glimpse into that.  I'll also take this opportunity to say again how much I hate Gone With the Wind... a classic joke of overacting (not Gable) and inadvertent racism that I couldn't get past.  Films with double purpose of education and entertainment are few and far between.  Chalk another one up for Norton, this one's a keeper.  Prepare to be shocked. 10/10",10,0,1,16 December 2002
Amadeus," The medium of film should have ended after this movie
","I grew up with this movie because my father watched all the time.  Only when I got older did I realize its brilliance.  Salieri is one of my favorites in film history.  How often do you get that deep into the psyche of a character?  That level of character development gives the viewer an interpretation for EVERY look on F. Murray Abraham's face, and not to mention, an intense connection with the story.  After all, this is Salieri's movie, not Mozart's.This film is packed with movie moments that grip you, and most of them involve scenes showcasing Mozart's music.  I am so happy that Mozart's beautiful catalog of music is associated with this top-notch film, even though the story is fictional.  However, you know that there was at least one composer who recognized Mozart's pure genius, and professional envy is a common vice.  Salieri represents a mind-blowing glimpse into how jealousy can tear a man to shreds.    Film simply does not get much better than Amadeus.  'And then... an oboe.'  10/10 ****",10,3,5,16 December 2002
Caddyshack," Rodney has staying power
","You can't help but love Rodney Dangerfield.  A lot of his jokes aren't funny, but he sells them... well at that.  His persona is the joke and I laugh every time.  Bill Murray just isn't that funny in this film except when he's undressing the old rich ladies with his eyes and talking dirty to himself.  Chevy Chase was also hilarious and I'm not sure why.  Comedy doesn't always have to make sense.Why did they throw in a love story?  This film could have been a lot better if they had more gags and more Rodney.  Who cares?  This film is still worth it, but will fade.  7/10.",7,1,1,30 December 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," A masterpiece... undying relevancy
","SPOILERSKubrick is perhaps the only director in the history of film that never made a mediocre film.  Even his early work (The Killing and Paths of Glory) were incredible; his career seemed as carefully planned as his films.  2001 was an excellent example of a finely tuned vehicle to express concern about the adverse effects of technology.  Although 2001 was slow in parts, the film should be viewed as a whole.  The beginning made me think I accidentally rented planet of the apes, but as the film progressed Kubrick's message becomes more and more apparent and early scenes soon made perfect sense. The themes in the film are several, and will continue to make 2001 relevant for generations.  Also, HAL is one of the greatest screen villains of all time because he does not have a physical presence and is omnipresent on that ship.  It was definitely man vs. technology, but it also could have been a man vs. god sequence as well.  HAL, HAL, HAL.  The film is also worth seeing for the theme music.  Seldom does music fit a film so perfectly and tightly.  That's Kubrick for you.  See this one, and everything else Kubrick directed.",9,0,3,17 December 2002
This Is Spinal Tap," Fails to amuse
","Now some parts of this movie were funny, but overall Christopher Guest annoys me to no end in all three of his major films (this one, Guffman, and Best of Show).  At the time, when rock was king, this film was probably a lot more relevant.  But I'm 22, and the old rockers and 80's hair bands were fading quickly when I started listening to music.  I've seen VH1 documentaries and know enough about the 'rock 'n' roll' lifestyle to get the jokes.  I also get Guest's subtle, dry sense of humor and where the jokes are, but I just don't laugh.  Perhaps I reject his basic tenet of humor based on laughing at other people's stupidity (in the way he does it).  I believe this movie and the other two in Guest's pathetic trilogy are solely for that special breed of popular kids in high school that overtly or covertly relished in every moment of their supremacy.  This one's for you, wodies.  Then check out Guffman, you'll laugh your head off.  6/10",6,3,13,25 December 2002
There's Something About Mary," Rompish
","This film had several great bits such as the dying dog and the scrotum in the zipper.  I also thought Cameron Diaz played the 'perfect girl' role very well, she has a presence about her like the starlets of old.  Hard to find nowadays.  I loved Matt Dillon in this film as the non-stop hustler.  Gotta admire that.",9,0,1,15 December 2002
Rocky," Everyone loves an underdog
","SPOILERSI was very entertained by this movie, based on the fact that everyone loves an underdog (I am no exception).  Seeing how Rocky's life was established in the first half of the movie made this film.  This wasn't just a boxing movie, it was a film about a man's life.  A guy who has been told he's a loser, and looking at what he has in his life you may think that too. However, this is Rocky Balboa and how he manages to hold his head up is beyond me let alone go 15 rounds with the champ.  I also loved the fact that he lost the fight.  He didn't lose, he won.However, how this film beat out Network (one of my all time favorites), All the President's Men, and Taxi Driver is a shame.  1976 was an awesome year in film, but Network really should have won.  8/10.",8,0,0,25 December 2002
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," clever, well done
","For what this film was, I don't think it could have worked on the main criticism I have for it.  The fast paced nature of the film combined with the many different characters leads one to be confused as to who is mad at who and who has what.  However, I could follow it well enough to see absorb the skeleton of the plot and see Ritchie's creativity in storytelling.  This film begs for a second viewing, and I will probably give it that.  Highly entertaining and very creative.  Tough to get the accents sometime though. 8/10.",8,4,4,30 December 2002
The Green Mile," Intense emotional manipulation
","Something about this movie really hit home with me, I found it to be very moving.  However, I could see how someone would not approve of it highly. It tiptoes the line between drama and melodrama, but I believe NOT once ventures into the latter (close though).  I thought all of the characters were believable, the least of which was Percy.  Nevertheless, he is a very necessary character even if he is a little over the top with the portrayal of the evil side of things.The one man enduring all the pains of the world is a common character in many mythologies and I think this movie did so well because viewing a person with that responsibility hits home with everyone.  It did so for me.  This is an easy movie to get into.",10,1,3,17 December 2002
Stalag 17," Chalk another one up for Wilder
","MINOR SPOILERSI found this film entertaining from start to finish.  Wilder took a huge risk with setting a Drama/Comedy in a Nazi prisoner of war camp.  However, Wilder in his prime could do no wrong.Yes, it can be challenging to get over the fact that the environment inside that P.O.W. camp was very silly and light-hearted.  However, one must note the difference between inside and outside the barracks.  The men offered themselves a personal escape through the games, schemes, and jokes. Outside, a very serious no-nonsense kommandant and two of their friends killed trying to escape.  It amazes me how Wilder blended the two extremes so masterfully.  I believe that some people misinterpret this movie as a flop because they can't pull themselves out of the assumed seriousness of the camp.Bill Holden is amazing.  He has an air about him that few actors are blessed with. Also the interaction with the spy and the rest of the barracks once we know he is the spy is gripping. Stalag 17 is a class-act, it deserves a viewing.",10,3,6,13 December 2002
The Producers," Let's hear it for the Jews!
","By far the best Mel Brooks' film I've ever seen.  I laughed start to finish finding the recurring old lady bit hilarious... it makes me crack a smile every time I think about it.  See this film... you certainly won't regret it.Mel Brooks said that the worst thing he could do to Hitler was make people laugh at his image.  The way he does it is masterful... and I'm not exactly sure how he pulled it off.  'Springtime for Hilter' or 'Winter for Poland and France' was undoubtedly one of the most brilliant comedic sequences I've ever seen.  Dick Shawn was hysterical as LSD/Hitler, and I also thought he was the best part of Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  Its a shame he never blew up.No wonder The Producers is doing so well on Broadway, the bits and story are unbeatable.  `10/10 Wham!",10,0,1,15 December 2002
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," powerful gothic
","SPOILERSI really liked this film.  As usual, Pitt's acting is great as well as everyone else (even the young Kirsten Dunst).  The film was masterfully set in a very dark mood to reflect the feeling of Pitt's character.  Anne Rice creatively humanized the vampire condition and gave them emotions.  Because I understood the vampire's perspective, I didn't look at their killing as reckless or evil, but necessary.  Harsh reality.  Superb work, and would have gotten a 9/10 if it wasn't for the last couple scenes.  Those could have been done much better.  When Pitt walked out of the movie theater in 1988 you get this great sense that he's a walking anachronism.  Then Cruise kills Slater to some cheezy song playing on the radio on the Golden Gate bridge while exclaiming 'I've been listening to his whining for centuries.' Poor, poor.  More scenes like Pitt's sad exit from the movie theater would have been great.  It is an unheard of event that a man gets to experience modern technology and transportation while knowing the inconveniences of the past.  Not to mention the changing culture and morality.  A greater focus on that would have made this film a 10, but no.  8/10.",8,1,2,30 December 2002
Gangs of New York," Poor Scorcese
","I know the great Martin Scorcese was not the sole input into this film, and may be representative of how hard it is to make a truly excellent motion picture in this day and age.  What didn't help was how DD Lewis tried to act like DeNiro the whole goddamn movie.  Any moment I expected him to bust into a 'you talkin' to me?'  The screenplay was flat out unbelievable and poorly developed, while DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis, and Diaz were all miscast.  I wonder if Scorcese chose them or the studio did.  If Daniel Day Lewis is going to put on a DeNiro show for 2.5 hours, then why not just get DeNiro and make him look a little younger?  Perhaps Bob wasn't interested.",7,0,0,2 July 2003
All the President's Men," Big Brother
","All the President's Men is a case in which the story is so compelling, that it is virtually impossible to make a poor movie.  The project also wasn't hurt by Redford and Hoffman, who played the parts beautifully.  I really enjoyed that this story was told solely from the perspective of Woodward and Bernstein, and the White House and its staff was completely unseen.  This added the needed 'mysterious' villain aspect of the story.  It also made the enemy into a force, rather than reduce it to individual people.  Quite a powerful force too.  If you feel the magnitude of what these two young journalists are going up against, you'll love this movie.  Very intense.  9/10",9,1,1,20 December 2002
