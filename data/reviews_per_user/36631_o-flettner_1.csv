The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A film which got on my nerves more than anything
","Let me start off by saying my girlfriend is a huge fan of the franchise before this film. i was suspicious before going to watch it as i am not really a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan but i decided to go watch it anyway. We sat in the movie and i am sad to say we were both highly disappointed by this movie. Don't get me wrong i love to see more heroines starring in movies and therefore i was willing to give this movie a chance. however the directors of this movie made it so obvious they were trying as hard as they could to create a female lead role that they turned the potentially interesting story into a bland, frustrating, badly acted mess which doesn't do justice to the hype created around this movie. Every second word in this movie was about 'peter', and about how she didn't care about anyone in the big picture just about saving her peter, whilst constantly collapsing in tears, endangering her peers and blowing off her boyfriend who wants to be loved but instead is ignored because of a less attractive scrawny pipsqueak, who is also blown up to be a hero undeservedly. Even the people in the movie seem to get annoyed with Jennifer Lawrence's annoying portrayal of the 'mockingjay' and her obsession with peter. my girlfriend and i are both in agreement that we wasted money and 2 precious hours on this hyped up, big budget, badly directed movie which left us totally underwhelmed. the best part of the film was the trailers at the beginning for better movies. Don't waste your money on this guys!",3,26,38,23 November 2014
