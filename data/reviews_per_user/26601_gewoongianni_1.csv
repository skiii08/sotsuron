Hereditary," A terrifying slow disappointment
","Let's just stop hyping up movies. The reviews and stories about this movie made me pretty curious, but it didn't came anywhere close to my expectations at all. 1 - 0 for the marketing department. The grief / sleep deprivation / stress / schizophrenia template mixed up with the 'oh no we've seanced up the wrong spirit' concept is getting old.The ant-infested head on the road was the goriest scene to look at, shock value 3/10. The acting and some of the cinematography was good tho, and the fast changing of day and night as result of no sleep was done well too - I'm not overall salty so credit where credit's due.Hereditary is just another example of the same story told a million times before, without adding any exciting new scare tactics or interesting views. Bottom line; never go live in a cottage in the woods, build a tree house or little modelhouses and never ever ever do a seance, especially if your mother is an undercover queen spirit ghost leader trying to channel a prince of hell into one of your kids.",4,1,3,17 July 2018
