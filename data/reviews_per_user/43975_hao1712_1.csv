Iron Man 3," Good show but bad Iron Man movie
","The most important part that I don't understand is how can his armor be so weak? He can withstand tank attack, hit by a supersonic jet, Thor hammer and thunder but his armor cannot withstand his girlfriend punch of 3,000 Celsius. What is he doing dumbing around after Extremis touched him? They paralyze him? He is in an armor for god sake. This is a total insult to Iron Man suit... His weaponry are also too weak in this movie, he cannot punch a guy flying through air like what he did in his first movie, his replusor can't blow a guy's head off and his suit can be recharged without the need of his arc reactor.On the bright side, if you doesn't factor in that this is an Iron Man movie related to the previous 2 movies, it provide quite an entertaining show with Tony Stark try to work his way out of trouble given all the limitations he is facing. Robert Downey Jr. saved the whole Iron Man 3 movie by him self.",5,16,31,29 April 2013
