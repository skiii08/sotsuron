The Avengers," More, more, MORE!!!
","All I could think of as the end credits rolled was, MORE PLEASE!!! I would gladly have turned around and watched it again!The Avengers is not a deep thinking film. You will not leave the theater enlighted or confused. It won't cause you to re-think your world or your ideals, it won't be a debate provoking film amongst your other intellectual friends... but it WILL leave you thoroughly entertained!!! Those who are not of the genre will call it 'mindless banter' and scoff at it. Those who are OK with being transported temporarily to a place where they can forget everything for 2 1/2 hours and just enjoy it, they will love it!The previous movies have given substance, background and depth to the characters (most of them). They feel familiar and 'make sense'. The story line is simple and predictable, Evil returns, wants to enslave Earth, team of superheroes assembles and drive evil away... or do they? (stay through the ending credits, trust me).It's not the 'super story' that keeps you glued to your chair. It is everything else. Somehow you are not the slightest bit annoyed (or care for) the predictability of the story. I don't think a better director could have been chosen for this film. Joss Wheddon has just the right amount of childhood wonder still in him to re-create something magical ... it was like.. watching the coming book come to life!! Please tell me there is a sequel!!!",10,2,7,28 April 2012
The Hunger Games," Didn't expect to like it... but I DID!!!
","I am always suspicious when I go in to watch 'teen-hero' movies. It's just not my style and I am starting to think I am getting old :) I can never connect with the younger characters and can never empathize with them like I did when I was in my teens.I did not expect to like this movie but I DID!!! I thoroughly enjoyed it!! I must point out that I have not read the books so I can't offer an opinion on whether they were true to the books etc. What I can say is that this movie takes you to a wonderful trip into a new world and that even though the main actors are not well-known, they make you like them... heck, I even shed a tear or two!!I would have liked a little more background in general as I kinda had the feeling the movie went off on the assumption that most viewers would have read the book. And also, the shaky camera was really, really, really annoying and dizzying. Other than that, I loved it. It was fast paced, did not bore you and was to the point. I can't wait for the sequel.. and I will probably go buy the books now.",9,2,12,25 March 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Awesome as a movie... but not Star Trek
","I give it a 9 out of 10 because as a movie, if you are not a Trekkie, if you had no idea what Star Trek was, it IS visually stunning and I went to see it twice.However this is not really Star Trek. It is so far off the original... which makes me fear dearly for Star Wards that J.J. has taken over.The movie is very predictable and it often made me say 'Yeah, I've seen this before in the previous Star Trek by J.J'. Same tricks same visuals, same theme..I think Khan was played very well by B. Cumberbatch. He was scary, formidable, cold... but he lacked the charm of Ricardo Montalban . I liked the fact that Spock finally let his human side show through. He chose the Vulcan side but he IS half human. I know a lot of critics didn't like that BUT this IS a re-launch, the events that led the original Spock to be cold and logical did not transpire in this universe, so why Spock Jr, NOT chose his human side?I liked the 'coming of age' of Kirk... but I though McCoy was underutilized and a little cheesy. What the heck happened to Simon Pegg? We had trouble recognizing him!! Did he have a face lift or something?All in all I liked it... I would love to see more. If you are a hard core Trekkie you will find a ton to complain about. If you keep an open mind, you will enjoy it!",9,2,5,5 August 2013
The Expendables," Blood, death and good laughs - Brilliant!!
","Before you read this you should know I am a 30 something mom of two who is not so much into movies filled with explosions and I certainly do not like beat'em up movies either... BUT... I REALLY loved 'The Expendables'!!!The actual script is nothing new or innovative... a group of mercenaries hired for a job. I could even call it predictable... No, this movie is not based on it's scenario so much as it is carried on by the chemistry of its protagonists.Stallone and Statham are a killer duo. The rapport between them is excellent!! The action scenes are kinda blown out of proportion but that's the charm!! You know what you are seeing is un-doable but you still fall for it and go 'wow' nevertheless with a silly smile upon your face. It's just so... entertaining.There isn't a dull moment in the film, the pace is fast, the cinematography fantastic. There is a *lot* of blood but it is done very artfully, not concentrating on the gore at all. They don't need to; the movie is carried along beautifully without having to 'wow' you with blood... there is a lot of it but it's not what you are noticing. You are listening to the dialogue between the characters, or how Statham works his knives or Stallone re-loads his guns... in reality there is blood in most scenes but it's only a flash of it, the actors carry the weight of the film, not the special effects!!The first thing I told my husband as the final credits rolled by was 'I need this in Blu Ray!' I really wish there is a sequel to this... it was an action movie *so well done*... Possibly the best movie I've seen all year!!! Bravo Stallone, bravo!!!",10,1,5,21 August 2010
Hugo," Incredibly boring...
","If you go in to see a magical film in the likes of Narnia, filled with magic and adventure, with a fantastic, mystery automaton at the core as the trailers suggest , you will be sorely disappointed. 'Hugo' is nothing like that. The trailers are extremely misleading as to the actual story and with over 2 hrs runtime, and a story that goes nowhere, it is a VERY boring film.Hugo is a little orphan boy that has gone through H!ll and back, yet there is absolutely no emotion from him, he is as hollow as the little automaton he is repairing. His little friend is absolutely a horrible actress too, her performance is awful! No emotion (plus she wears the same mismatched clothes all through the movie!)The story starts out about a little orphan boy who lives in the Paris train station and winds up the clocks. He is in possession of a little mystery automaton which he is repairing because he thinks it holds a message from his dead father. By chance he hooks up with mystery toy shop owner George Melies (Ben Kingsley) and the story suddenly becomes about George Melies and *his* sorrow over how his movies were not what people wanted to see after WWI.The cinematography is absolutely stunning. I did not see this film in 3D. The sets, the mood, the people, the costumes... fantastic!! But the story wasn't there. There was no magic, no mystery and no adventure. It was not a Narnia like film... it was a lecture on the early days of cinema and one of the great directors' work.Another thing I noticed was that there was a lot of silence in the film. Great shots but you ended up staring at them for a good few minutes with no story or dialog happening. I can't see my kids sitting through this. I can't see an adult sitting through this!! I think a documentary of George Melies would have me much more interested than false advertising for a magical film...Ben Kingsley performed as expected. He is really good at everything he does. Jude Law... well you blinked and he was gone. He had like 5 sentences to say. Now he can add 'played in a Scorcese film' in his resume. Christopher Lee had a nice small part too. Sascha Baron Cohen... hmmm. I know a lot of people didn't like him but I found him good. Although he was supposed to be funny he did come out more annoying than funny but I did end up sympathizing with his character, so I liked him.If only the story was there as promised (advertised) if this was indeed a magical adventure. If more talented young actors were chosen that delivered emotion... paired with the stunning visuals of the films it would have been... magic!! If only...",1,42,80,19 February 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," San Francisco has a LOT of primates!!!
","After seeing this movie, honestly I can't remember why I couldn't WAIT to go see it! It was terrible!! If it weren't for the bigger names in the cast, it would have been one of those B movies that only play on TV at 3am on a weekday!The plot is terrible and full of holes for starters. I am a Sci-Fi freak so me wanting to believe in the super-natural/fantastic is a given. I really WANTED to believe but nothing was actually believable. I didn't feel anything for the characters, neither the human nor the chimp ones.The graphics themselves were terrible. The primates were NOT believable. OK, the Uraguntans and the Gorrilas were but the Chimps? Waaaaay too human, even in size (Chimps are NOT 6' 1' when they stand up! and their legs are NOT that long!!).And seriously how many primates does San Francisco have? In the beginning we are shown a primate 'pound' with a handful of primates, then when they revolt, dozens and dozens escape. Apparently the SF zoo hosts about a hundred more etc. And please tell me, where do you buy those city cars than when a half-ton Gorilla jumps on them, they don't get a single dent!!! And their roofs don't cave in, because my jeep has a 130 lbs tolerance on the roof and that's waaaay less than what a gorilla weighs!Terrible all around. I was so disappointed, I wish I had spent my money on something else. Don't go see it for the plot (there isn't any), don't go see it for the CGI (they are second class at best) and don't go see it for the actors, you see very little of them. And why on Earth was Ceasar so human looking? It is not explained or justified at all during the movie.All around baaaad. And I hear there is a part two?? Oh no!",Null,11,25,7 August 2011
Cars 2," Very disappointing
","We went to see Cars 2 with my boys who are 6 years old. We all loved the first movie, it had a simple to follow, heart-warming story and NO VIOLENCE!!!This movie had TONS of violence, guns, 'dead' cars, cars getting bashed, burned, tortured. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?!? Just because it was cars and not people did you think the kids wouldn't notice? It was a very hard to follow story for them. A full-on James Bond movie, with twists and gadgets, except in animation and with cars instead of humans.My twins could not repeat the story back to us when asked afterward. Espionage, oil wars and the likes were lost on the younger audience. The violence was full-on. Even Mater, the plain, redneck, lovable character was fitted with machine guns!! In fact the movie was more a Mater movie than a Lightning McQueen movie. We see McQueen in very few scenes compared. It more like a full feature Mater Tale than a sequel to the movie... plus it wasn't about racing at all but rather about oil wars.Very disappointing. My husband made a good point, he said it was as if it was aimed to the 8 year old who watched the original 5 years ago and are now 13 years old. Certainly NOT aimed at young kids. If your kids are very young and you do not approve of violence, beatings, killings and guns DO NOT TAKE THEM. I wish someone had warned us, we wouldn't have gone. I can't fathom what Pixar was thinking! I am now dreading Monsters INC 2... it will most certainly be ... I don't know... full of blood and guts? That seems to be their next step...",4,53,90,26 June 2011
The Dark Knight," Absolutely Great but....
","I watched Batman this last week with my husband. I will start by saying I am not a fan of Christian Bale at all but he was very suited in his role as Batman and very convincing. The cast was in general, very well picked and very suited for their roles. Aaron Echhart was amazing and Heath Ledger was absolutely Oscar material in his role as the Joker!!As I was watching the film, I grew uneasy though. The 'darkness' of the film was overwhelming at times and at 2 1/2 hrs long after a while I was looking at my watch begging there would be no more. The film was GOOD, but I found myself holding my breath far too many times, cringing far too many times and agonizing far too many times for me to say I had fun. I left the cinema with a very heavy heart and rather depressed to be honest. The Joker kept outsmarting the Batman and when he didn't it happened in a ridiculous way and I was like 'that was all?!'The film had too many high points in the plot to be honest. It felt as if was caught in a rough sea which was fun for a while but the waves kept coming and coming and coming and coming.... and coming... with no end until it was not fun anymore. After the 2 hrs mark I just wanted the film over already. Just grab the Joker and kill him and be done with it, let's go home!! There was also too much information in this film. They could have made TWO films out of it easily. Seriously! Things kept happening and happening and happening and happening some more... too many locations, too many characters, the film was bustling with them, too many stories, plots and us agonizing and holding our breaths throughout the film.Technically the film was amazing. But it was looooong and got tiring after a while. There were long films that were telling a story (like LOTR) that were smooth and had highs and lows nicely distributed and even though it was longer than Batman the time flew and I enjoyed it. Batman was 'bang bang bang bang bang' one after the other, the other, the other, the other until my head hurt and I started looking at my watch. 'Be done already' I kept thinking... 'what else can POSSIBLY happen now!?' so many things happened! I am telling you it could have been two films...I gave it a 9 because otherwise it really was a good, good, good film... and for a while I did enjoy it. After a while I just wanted out of the theater... And RIP Heath... we will miss you!",9,3,8,20 July 2008
Avatar," By the end, you'll be playing for the blue side!
","I won't state the obvious, you've read it in all the other comments; this is an amazing visual film!! You simply *cannot* tell this is CGI!! You cannot! Of course to be honest, the fact that this is an alien world with nothing to compare it with, helps Cameron and I have a suspicion that if they were trying to re-create Earth and human actors, the end result wouldn't be so believable. But nevertheless, Cameron actually *brings* you into Pandora and you will simply fall in love with this world and it's natives, the Na'vi.Lots of commenters have said that the story/plot was stale and old. Yes, the plot has been done before... the foreigner (human in this case) falls in love with the native ... Pocahontas anyone? But in the end... so what!? Seriously, how many stories *haven't* been told? What exactly would you consider original? This is the post-modern age... we've seen it all; the romance, the gory, the idiotic and now movie makers are focusing on scaring us by not showing anything... playing with our psyche because our *eyes* have seen it all. Except Pandora... you haven't seen anything like that. I loved the story... yes it was Pocahontas all over again in another setting but so what? I think the simple story worked for this film. I really left the viewing with a smile on my face. I didn't have to ponder over difficult questions and I could focus on the visual Heaven Cameron created. Not that this film is without it's moral lessons... I was kind of ashamed I am human and really wanted to turn blue.. at the end I was playing for the blue side and so will you... If this is the future of cinema, well I can't wait for what comes next... because I tell you, everything else after this, kinda feels stale!",10,5,11,19 December 2009
Thor," An(nother) American Twist of someone's mythology...
","I went to see Thor without having read a single critic or even seen a trailer. I went in expecting to see a boring movie but I came out having really enjoyed myself... but then again I am not Norwegian! If you have a very basic knowledge of Scandinavian mythology, then you will probably miss all the twisted parts of the mythology here and you will just enjoy a very enjoyable film for what it is... nicely fast paced, visually impressive and enjoyable.I suppose I feel about this film like I felt about Percy Jackson... I couldn't enjoy the film because as a Greek I was SO annoyed by all the inaccuracies and twists of a mythology I grew up with and know well. I guess the Norwegian feel the same way...I gave it a ten because I really liked it! It had everything, action, adventure, romance and a good pinch of comedy, we all laughed quite a few times.** Here come the spoilers ** Thor, the son of Odin lives with his brother Loki in Asgard and he is to succeed his father to the throne. He is brave but a bit of a hot head so when their biggest enemy, the Frost Giants, find a way into Asgard on his big day, he of course wants to go after them. Odin forbids it but he goes off anyway which earns his banishment...into 2011 Earth!! Stripped of his powers and his beloved Mjolnir, his hammer of the Gods, he must grow as a person first, put others before himself and prove himself if he is ever to be a god again and be allowed to return to Asgard and the throne.There he meets the sweet and slightly awkward astrophysicist Jane (Portman) and we have quite a few funny scenes and quite a bit of sparks flying off between them. When S.H.I.E.L.D (remember then from Iron Man?) find out about the Mjolnir which is in the desert of New Mexico and nobody can lift it, they take over ... and the fun begins..Nice story with quite a few twists, likable characters (even if a bit one-dimensional but this is a fantasy fast paced adventure, so we don't care much!), lovely visual effects and big names delivering as expected... and not really too scary even for 10 year olds!!",10,0,2,1 May 2011
Inception," Mind blowing (and boggling)!
","There are many reasons why I liked 'Inception'. First of all the cast of actors was brilliant! I've always liked DiCaprio as an actor and always thought he was a damn great one! He just proves it again in this film. I can't say enough about Ellen Page either... I am still amazed of the depth of her performance mostly because you are fooled by her baby-ish appearance!I think it has all been said in the reviews prior to mine. The film is original and this is its greatest asset, especially since, by now, we have 'seen it all'. It is really difficult to see a truly original idea these days.My only objection comes from the 'extreme' use of guns and explosions. I loved the way the film twisted my brain but I thought the film didn't really need ALL that 'firepower' to impress me. It's like the script was written and then someone said 'It's great but if we want to really make our money, let's add some car chase and a bunch of spectacular explosions... Yeah, explosions... films with explosions always sell'I argued with my husband that I understand the need for the existense of some sort of villain within the Dream (the Projections). Otherwise there would be no urgency, no ticking clock, no need for hurrying it up... I just thought especially when they reached the 3rd level of the Dream (Snow) it was a little 'too' much. I got a little tired with all the action scenes and I so did my husband and the rest of the males in our group (so no, it wasn't just us women lol).A collective yelp rose from the audience when the last scene rolled by. As the spinning Jack wobbles and we expect it to fall (or not fall), the scene goes black and the audience is left wondering. Personally, following my train of logic, I think Cobb never did wake up...I really enjoyed this film... I recommend it whole-heartedly!",8,2,6,28 August 2010
Fast Five," I was going to keep my husband company but WOW!!
","I am not a 'fast cars - cute guys' girl at all so when my husband said he wanted to see this, I only went along to keep him company (and to twist his arm into coming to see a chick flick in the future with me!!).I really, really enjoyed 'Fast Five'. The movie was packed with action from start to finish... I had only seen the first film previous to this so there was a connection with the characters which are very likable, and by now if you have see the previous movies, very likable.I was excited to see Dwayne Johnson (the Rock) can actually ACT!!! :) I liked it so much, I am pulling the previous movie out of the shelf tonight to watch.One thing I will say is: Stay and watch ALL the credits. You do not want to miss what comes by the time the last of them roll by... We didn't know but thankfully we were just going down the steps when it happened and now we are very excited... at least half of the audience had gone and missed it!",10,1,4,8 May 2011
