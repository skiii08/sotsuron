Child 44," Laughable anti-soviet (russian) propaganda.
","Movie is actually a bit toned down compared the anti-soviet imaginations presented in the book. Unfortunately movie is not much better than the source. As a person who is familiar with what communism in USSR was (parents/relatives), nothing which is accented on in the movie is true. USSR had low crime rates, not because simply ignoring the crime, but due to overall mindset. When there were actually cases, they would be immediately investigated. Soviet Union could not afford eliminating people in such rates as shown in movie. If this was true, population of USSR would decline rapidly. Control was strict, surveillance was there, KGB and so on, but they did whatever FBI/CIA are doing these days in USA. Hunger was not only Ukrainian problem prior to WW2, it was problem of USSR as whole due to many reasons, including poor decision making in critical times. Ukrainians love to speculate that it was something set against them, somewhat of a holocaust. Ignorance and stupidity of undereducated people who think like that. I'd love them to investigate on this problem.It makes me sad when movies like this are shown to people, who are not familiar with history of Russian Empire/USSR. This heresy ruins future image of russians. I am not surprised we are presented/seen as a global threat. When you learn more about our culture, you will understand how laughable movies like this are, when casted actors can't even pronounce simple Russian words. Cluelessly or intentionally they are digging a hole between World and Russia, as future generations will form opinion based on this movie. Writer of this book wanted to show a system trying to prevent crime investigation. He choose system he probably knew less about. Result is this movie. Maybe idea could be fun, but inaccuracy makes it unwatchable, despite how serious this movie is trying to be (Tom Hardy is in it, one of my fav actors)....",1,9,20,6 July 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," Review\Rant
","I will not give away any spoilers or anything, just will give my impression of the movie. The movie is definitely entertaining, the main and supporting cast are doing well. Tone wise movie is far too light for what Ragnarok stands for. And you never really worry for any of the main cast, at least I did not. The feeling was similar to watching a cartoon - colors, action, dialogues not too heavy on the words, moments of build up and joy, moments of emptiness. Movie earns a 7/10 and a solid one. Now for the rant: Can IMDb stop letting accounts with less than 1 week after registration period post reviews? First review I've read, prior to writing my own, was a Bulgarian guy giving movie a 10/10 (movie has flaws). Guy has no other ratings, review or anything. Accounts is 2 days old. So I decided to check other 10/10 reviews - all fresh accounts, made on the day of the premier or just now. Isn't this suspicious? The ratings can also go both ways. Just I don't want any of fake publicity shadow other people's opinions, including my own. I am more than sure no one watched this movie and said to himself/herself 'Hey, I must go on IMDb, make an account and review this!'. This is not that kind of movie, you will get same emotions as you've received from the trailer, to put it short. Nothing special :D",7,31,70,21 October 2017
