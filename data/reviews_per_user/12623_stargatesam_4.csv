Iron Man 3," Wonderful! They absolutely played this one just right.
","I love the fact that Marvel knew 'we can't go bigger than we've just gone.' Meaning that to try and follow Avengers with bigger wild action would have been futile. So, they went in a unique, deeper and more powerful direction. Sure there are stunning action sequences but everything is in context of a greater theme and the entire story. They absolutely played this one just right. They let The Avengers sit on its own and didn't do anything but feed off the momentum and actions of that film. Everything here is focused on Tony Stark and his immediate universe. Avengers 2 is the last thing on anyone's mind watching this and, as much as I loved Avengers, that's a good thing. Everything needs to kind of re-set and take a breath. This movie is NOT concerned with being connected to anything larger or having Nick Fury come in and solve or oversee anything. The events in The Avengers are addressed but only felt as to their effect on Tony's psyche. This movie is about Tony Stark's journey after we've seen him last. It really does perfectly explore his character and develops him deeper than we have seen since the first act of the very first film. It really is the perfect way to go and everything is exceptionally well done.",Null,48,99,22 April 2013
42," Wonderful Film On Many Levels
","I have to say I was very impressed with this film and it's FAR better than what I expected. It plays with more heart and better balance than most other films that tackle this well covered subject. It's sentimental but in a very good way. Some people may label that as cheese but it works perfectly here.As expected, Jackie's perspective and his trials were covered but the film offers a glimpse of the era and other character motivations are touched upon. It was great to see that not every white guy was portrayed as an ignorant redneck fool. There's a fair share of them in the film but there were a fair share of them back then as well. This is almost as much Branch Rickey's (Harrison Ford) movie as it is Jackie's. The supporting characters are wonderful. The baseball itself is sound and shot very well. I was pleasantly surprised to see the faith aspect was actually quite strong. A great line from the film said to Jackie by Rickey: 'You need to be like our Savior and have the guts to turn the other cheek.' It seems both Rickey and Robinson were devote Christians and the story did not shy away from that factor. Like everything, they played it right without too heavy a hand.",Null,0,0,22 April 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," All hail the new KING! The best comic book movie ever made.
","Yes, the title says it all. All hail the new KING! I'm not saying this to anger any fan of other franchises but I'd have to rate Age of Ultron a true 10/10 masterpiece and THE best comic book movie ever made. Much like the first Avengers, it is as close to a perfect movie as you can get regardless of the genre. In fact, I consider this effort superior to that first film and I didn't think that was even possible. As has been noted before, Superman had generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film flaws and all. Spider-Man had generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character and the time it hit. (Yet, those two awful reboot movies are definitely something the character needs to shake off at this point) TDK had held the title as the most rabidly defended superhero movie from its fan base. Iron Man had generally held the title as best all-around origin film. Captain America The Winter Soldier added its own unique flavor and vaulted to the head of most people's 'best sequel' list. However, I can honestly say that Avengers Age of Ultron tops them all in every single category. It is IMO shear perfection on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, thrilling, fun and superbly done.I'm confident that when all is said and done this film will be thought of as the best of all-time.",Null,6,12,24 April 2015
Thor: The Dark World," Just Wonderful! Packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama and intensity.
","Thor The Dark World is brilliant and completely tops the first film. There are a lot of extremely funny bits in it as well as some dark and moving moments. Probably a much funnier movie than it had any right to be given the subject matter. Loki is done perfectly and the dialogue between him and Thor is superb.If you're a fan of the first, this certainly won't disappoint at all. Without spoiling anything, the scale of this film is very Avengers-like in that the action pieces are amazing. During a sequence halfway through, I literally turned to my friend and said, 'this is freakin' awesome'.Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape of the nine realms for two hours. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike other CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I've seen this year. I have to join the majority of people and even critics that are praising this film. It's a true joy and such a pleasant experience.",Null,101,189,31 October 2013
