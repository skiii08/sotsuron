The Blair Witch Project," The worst film ever?
","All I can say, is that I am glad I didn't go to the movies to see this, if I had, I would have gone out and demanded my money back.To be honest, I only saw the first half hour, I just couldn't stand any more of it, and had to switch it off.Bad acting, no plot, totally unscary, over hyped, complete and utter rubbish.Given the choice of watching BWP, or having my genitals torn off by a drug crazed, rabid rhinocerous, I'll pick the Rhino every time, it would be less painful.The only scary thing about this film is that there is a sequel.",Null,2,4,1 April 2002
Troy," Little more than OK.
","This was an OK sort of film, loosely based on the writings of Homer, the Greek guy, not Simpson.It did have a few tedious parts, but on the whole was worth watching.However, for me it was ruined by the godawful wailing that someone seems to think is music. It was like spending a night with Sinead O'Connor.The music director should invest in a dictionary, and look up the words Music, and Noise, I believe there is a difference between the two, he, as yet does not.",Null,1,2,12 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not bad, but not a classic
","My summary sums it up.Its not a bad film, but its not a great film either.I read the books years ago, and when the three (or four) films are complete, and I watch them consecutively, it might be a classic series, like James Clavells SHOGUN, but not yet.All the info about the plot has been covered within these pages, and I don't need to cover it again.It is worth watching, and you will enjoy it, a strong seven out of ten.",Null,0,0,6 January 2003
American Beauty," Mince
","I bought this film on DVD, as I had heard it was really good, and I am a fan of Kevin Spacey.What a waste of money, this is total drivel from start to finish, Kevin Spacey is totally wasted in this excuse for a film.This is so awful, it is down there in the bowels of bad films , along with Blair Witch and the Evil beneath Loch Ness.The money I spent on the disc would have been better invested on a donkey at the Kentucky Derby.Absolute Crap, avoid it like SARS",2,0,1,13 August 2003
The Dirty Dozen," An all time classic
","As it says above, an all time classic.If you haven't seen this film, where have you been?To be honest, I don't know where to start with this one, great novel, great screenplay, great actors, great performances, and well put together by the techie staff.That says it all, a great film, from a great premise.The only sad note is that a few of the participants are no longer with us, although others still are, and are still making films.This is in my all time top twenty, maybe even my top ten.A very strong 9/10",7,0,4,29 August 2003
Driven," Driven?, Drivel would be closer to the truth
","I was really looking forward to this film.  I know that Stallone, who I am a big fan of by the way, spent a lot of time around the Formula 1 paddock, doing the background.  But I have to say it was a real let down.The acting was wooden, the story was thin, and there were a lot of very obvious CG animated scenes.I saw it as little more than a Formula one/ Indy car version of Days of Thunder, transposed over the Old hero/relic coming back to the fray for one last stand routine.There was a section where there was a street race, in the race cars, which was a bit different, and that helped, although, with the cars needing a seperate starter to get going, I do wonder how they get started for the street race.I do like Stallone, his films are always watchable, not masterpieces of cinematography, or intellectually challenging opuses, but they do entertain.This one, I'm sorry to say, was pretty grim, and just scrapes to 4 out of 10.One final point, to all producers, writers and directors, if you want to make a film about motor racing in Europe, a Ferrari or two wouldn't hurt, they were strangely missing from this one, though Mercedes (McClaren) were very evident",Null,1,2,18 November 2002
From Hell," A pretty good effort
","This is a very good effort by all of the cast and crew.Although the Jack the Ripper story is well known and well trodden, with numerous books and films so far, this one is a little different, it actually names someone as the ripper, many don't.Not only that, but it names the person who is a lot of experts favourite for the crimes.The title is a bit of a hook, but some thing like 'Another Jack the ripper Film' wouldn't really have worked!The film does lend a bit of a human touch to the main players, it is easy to be trapped into focussing on what even today would be horrific crimes, From Hell avoids this well.Johnny Depp gives his usual excellent performance, he has gotten away from the odd ball roles he used to play, and his last few films have been of the highest quality. He really does get better with every film, and is beginning to fall into the class of actor, who, if he is in the film, it will be worth watching, a la Eastwood, Hanks, Ed Harris, Sam Jackson.
Robbie Coltrane is.......Robbie Coltrane, not a classical actor by any means, but well worth watching and the film benefits from his presence.The one thing that really stood out was Johnny Depps' Accent.  In general, North Americans have a bit of difficulty with British accents, mixing up Scottish and Irish, or Producing a 'snobby' upper class English one. Something like the nasal East End of London is a challenge.
Depps, in this case was totally first rate, He sounded like a real East Ender to me, a very good effort.In all, a good film, well worth the admittance or rental fee, in fact I might just nip out and buy it for my collection.",Null,0,1,13 July 2002
Enemy at the Gates," So real you can smell it!
","It is so refreshing to see a film where the actors and not the special effects are the stars.This is based on an allegedly true story, concerning the duel between Vassily Zaitsev, a Soviet, and Major Koenig, a German sniping expert, Koenig is sometimes referred to in Soviet war documents as Thorwald.The film focusses on Zaitsev, a shepherd, who has been a hunter in the Urals, and his rise to being not only a very sucessful sniper, but a talisman for the Russian people involved in the battle for Stalingrad.When he finds himself, and a Political Officer in a bit of bother, surounded by Germans, he manages to shoot all of them and make good an escape. The Political officer realises the value of such a man, and begins to publish a record of his kills,  ( I suppose he would be called a spin doctor today)As Zaitsevs' kill rate and notoriety rises, the Germans dispatch the head of their sniper school to kill him, and the duel ensues.Watch the film to find out what happens.The actors in this film had to act.  There is not as much dialogue as there would be in other films, and that is no bad thing, and to me it was an excellent way to work a film because of its realism, I don't think there would be much time for meaningless chatter when you are in a situation like this.The special effects which accompanied the film, rather than overtook it were excellent.This will go down as one of the great war films of all times, gritty, realistic and harrowing, you feel like you were there.This is definitely one for the collection, very highly recommended.",Null,0,1,16 July 2002
The Green Mile," Awesome.
","After many years, and hundreds of films, I really thought that The Godfather was the finished article, it couldn't be bettered.Until that is, I bought The Green Mile on a whim.I confess that I am a huge fan of Stephen Kings early work, Carrie, Salems Lot, The Stand,( in which Gary Sinese is tremendous)Christine,etc. Although in my opinion, most of his writing since Misery has been pretty grim.This is very different indeed.As an example, when I bought the film, I came home and stuck it in DVD player, just to watch the first 15 minutes, to see if I could get a grip on the plot. I was concerned that it would be another Geralds Game or Delores Claibourne and would be better in the bin.I watched the first 15 minutes and checked the clock, and found that 50 minutes had passed!!.  As i had to go work, I Left it alone.Later I watched it with my wife, and when it was over, we watched it all again.This without doubt the best film I have ever seen.  I have recommended it to numerous people who have, without fail come back to and said 'what a film , this is the best they have ever seen'.Tom Hanks is excellent, and in my opinion gives an Oscar winning performance when he is not even on screen!!, in a portion that he does with John Coffey ( Michael Clarke Duncan), Who tries to explain himself to Hanks.The opening part of the film, where a posse is searching for two missing girls, is frightening when they catch up with Coffey, you could see someone shoot Coffey, and it wouldn't have been out of place.David Morse is very good, as always, with a dry wit, that permeates through his role, similar to Victor Borge in a lot of ways.Doug Hutchinson as Percy Wetmore is tremendous, if ever i wanted to give someone in a film a punch in the face, he is the one. He plays the slimy, backside kissing, hateful, know it all to a tee.The only flaw I could find in the whole film was James Cromwell.  He played his part very very well indeed, but every time I see him in a film, I think of him as Zephram Cochrane in Star Trek - First Contact, Boogying hid brains out.This is an awesome film, without doubt the best of them all, better than the Godfather, not by much, but better, if you haven't seen it, watch it, and then , watch it again./",10,2,4,13 March 2002
The Green Mile," I am surprised
","I have commented on this film before, and am shocked that it is number 125 on the top 250.It is in my top 5, and giving leeway for different tastes is least 100 places too low in the chart.I am starting to wonder if the voters on this site have been watching too much talentless pre-packaged pop music, like the way drinking cheap wine destroys your pallette.This film is a modern classic,I could hardly fault it, in fact, it is one of the few films I have ever seen that brought a lump to my throat.Watch it, buy it, live it and love it, it is a great film.Lets give it the recognition that it deserves. For me, an easy 10/10",10,1,3,23 December 2003
