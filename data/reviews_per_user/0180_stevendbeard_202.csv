Ford v Ferrari," Interesting True Story
","I saw 'Ford v Ferrari', starring Matt Damon-Thor:Ragnarok, True Grit_2010, Christian Bale-Vice, 3:10 to Yuma_2007; Jon Bernthal-The Peanut Butter Falcon, The Punisher_tv and Josh Lucas-The Lincoln Lawyer, Hulk.
This movie is based on a true story about the fierce rivalry between Ford Motor Company and Ferrari. Ferrari had been winning the 24 hour race in Le Mans for years in the 1960's and Ford decided that it had been long enough. They hired Matt-playing Carroll Shelby-to build them a fast car to beat Ferrari. Jon-playing Lee Iacocca-is a negotiator for Ford. Josh is a Ford executive that does not like Matt's pick for a driver, Christian-playing Ken Miles. It is an interesting story of an American car designer trying to beat the European champions.
It's rated 'PG-13' for language and peril and has a running time of 2 hours & 32 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.",7,0,1,18 November 2019
Despicable Me 2," Great Sequel
","I saw 'Despicable Me 2', starring the voices of Steve Carell-The Office-t.v., Little Miss Sunshine; Kristen Wiig-Bridesmaids, MacGruber; Benjamin Bratt-Catwoman, Miss Congeniality and Russell Brand-Rock of Ages, Get Him to the Greek. This is the sequel-in case you could not tell by the number 2 in the title-to the blockbuster animated hit. Steve returns as Gru, a former villain that has gone straight since he has acquired three little girls. Russell returns as Dr. Nefario, Steve's assistant, who now works on their new business of making jellies & jams-remember, they have gone legit. A new villain appears and starts on a crime spree which causes the intervention of the secret spy organization called AVL-Anti Villain League-to ask Steve for his help. Since Steve is a former villain, he might be of assistance in apprehending Benjamin, aka El Macho. Kristen plays Lucy, an agent of AVL that is assigned to help Steve. And, of course the minions are back-I think they are the best part. If you liked the original, then you should enjoy this one, too. I went with my daughter, son-in-law and two grandkids and they all enjoyed it, too. It's rated 'PG' for rude humor and some mild action and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy this on Blu-Ray.",8,0,0,6 July 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Not as Scary But Good Story
","I saw 'Insidious: Chapter 2', starring Patrick Wilson-The Conjuring, Watchmen; Rose Byrne-X-Men First Class, Damages-t.v.; Barbara Hershey-Black Swan, Falling Down and Steve Coulter-The Conjuring, The Hunger Games.This is a sequel to the 2010 horror movie directed by James Wan-he directs this one, too, plus he also directed The Conjuring and the original Saw. In the first Insidious, Patrick and his wife Rose had problems with a demon using their son to enter our world. This one continues where it left off and the demon decides to use someone else as his vehicle to Earth. Barbara returns as Patrick's mother and Steve is their new guide to the spirit world and the burgeoning new field of astral projection; if you remember in the ending of the last one, the lady psychic died trying to save Patrick's son, using astral projection. This movie does go into the past history of the demon and what actually motivates him. I liked how they would show scenes from different perspectives; for instance, later in the movie, an earlier scene will be shown with different details highlighted, showing you what is really going on. I also liked how they relied more on actual actors in make-up, instead of CGI effects. If you liked the first one, you will probably like this one. Although there are some good scares, it's not as scary as the first one but the story more than makes up for it. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and sequences of terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes. I would probably buy this on DVD.",Null,0,1,13 September 2013
Blade Runner 2049," Visually Stunning
","I saw 'Blade Runner 2049', Ryan Gosling-La La Land, Young Hercules_tv; Robin Wright-House of Cards_tv, Wonder Woman; Jared Leto-Suicide Squad, Fight Club and Harrison Ford-The Star Wars movies, The Expendables 3. This is a sequel to the 1982 Blade Runner and it takes place 30 years later. Ryan is a Blade Runner-he is a cop that hunts down and usually terminates replicants, human looking robots that have gone rogue. Robin is his boss. When Ryan finishes his latest job, he discovers a buried dead body that leads him to go looking for Harrison, a former Blade Runner that disappeared about 30 years earlier. The corporation that makes replicants is run by Jared, and he acts kind of weird, like a futuristic blind hippie. There are questions about who is or is not a replicant and Sylvia Hoeks-an actress from the Netherlands-does a good job as the female counterpart to Rutger Hauer-also from the Netherlands. The visuals are stunning in the way the future is portrayed. There are several scenes of people playing music and a holographic image of the performer is shown, as if they were performing live. I remember seeing Elvis, Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe-I know, she is not a singer but they still showed her. There are 3 of the original cast members that pop up too, and yes, Harrison is one of them. Harrison does not make his appearance until about an hour and forty five minutes into the film, but it's almost 3 hours long so that is just a little over half way through. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 44 minutes. If you liked the original movie, then you will probably like this one, too. I know I did and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,3,10,6 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," True Sports Story, Disney Style
","I saw 'Million Dollar Arm', starring Jon Hamm-Mad Men_t.v., Sucker Punch; Lake Bell-No Strings Attached, Boston Legal_t.v.; Aasif Mandvi- Premium Rush, The Last Airbender and Bill Paxton-Haywire, True Lies.This is a Disney movie that is based on a true story about a sports agent, Jon, that goes to India to try and find the next big major league baseball pitcher. Jon is having some money problems since he lost his last big football client and really needs to get some new clients. Almost all of the major foreign countries have been depleted of future sports talent by other scouts so he figures, why not try India? He discovers that the people in India love the game of cricket-which involves throwing a ball-and he thinks that it might not be a giant leap for them to pitching a baseball. Jon takes a trip to India and has a talent hunt, in the form of a reality type t.v. show called Million Dollar Arm, in which the winner will win a trip to America and the chance to play in the major leagues . Aasif plays Jon's business partner, Bill is a trainer and Lake plays, literally, the girl next door to Jon that becomes his love interest. There is a lot of humor using the fish out of water themes, what with the Americans in India-getting sick on the food-and the Indians in America-they are not familiar with a lot of our conveniences. During the end credits, they show both pictures and video of the real players from India that the movie is based on, and they also tell you what happened to them. It's rated 'PG' for some mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. It's a nice Disney family style movie and I would probably buy it on DVD.",6,5,8,16 May 2014
First Man," Interesting But Slow
","I saw 'First Man', starring Ryan Gosling-La La Land, Lars and the Real Girl; Claire Foy-Vampire Academy, Season of the Witch; Jason Clarke-Winchester, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Corey Stoll-The Strain_tv, Salt.
This movie is based on Neil Armstrong's life and specifically, the years from 1961 through 1969. Neil was the first man to walk on the moon on July 20, 1969-that is what the title of the film is referring to, First Man. Ryan plays Neil, Claire is his wife, Jason is Ed White and Corey is Buzz Aldrin. The story covers the trials and errors in the process leading up to the monumental space mission, including some of the astronauts' personal family matters. It is a little slow in parts but it is an interesting story.
It's rated 'PG-13' for peril and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",6,2,4,15 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Good But Padded
","I saw 'The Hunger Games:Mockingjay-Part1', starring Jennifer Lawrence-X- Men:Days of Future Past, The Bill Engvall Show_tv; Josh Hutcherson-Red Dawn_2012, RV; Liam Hemsworth-Empire State, The Expendables 2; Julianne Moore-Carrie_2013, The Big Lebowski and Donald Sutherland-Horrible Bosses, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.It seems like a lot of franchise movies are dividing their last installments up into two movies to stretch out their box office bucks, and this one does it, too. This is basically a set up for the next movie. It's not bad but you can tell that it is padded to fill time. Anyway, if you recall in the last episode, Jennifer destroyed the Hunger Games tournament with her trusty bow & arrows and was rendered unconscious. When she wakes up, she is in District 13 which is run by Julianne as the district President. Julianne is trying to lead a rebellion against the Capitol and the evil Donald and thinks Jennifer would be perfect as a figure head to rally the troops. Jennifer does not know what happened to Josh but soon learns that Donald is using him to make propaganda videos to crush the rebellion. Liam, the spurned boyfriend of Jennifer, is still hanging around hoping Jennifer will choose him over Josh; but she just thinks of him as a friend. There is not a lot of Jennifer in action here; I can only remember her getting into a fight with her bow & arrows on one occasion, and she only fired one arrow-Of course, she took out two targets but that is what you can do, if you are a hero. Pretty soon, Jennifer is making her own propaganda videos and trying to rally her followers. FYI:Philip Seymour Hoffman died during filming, with most of his scenes completed-they filmed Part 2 at the same time, which is due next year. It ends in a cliffhanger that sets up Part 2 and there is a brief scene after the credits but it's not really a scene but more of a cryptic hint at the next installment, using the Mockingjay symbol. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. It's not action packed but I would probably buy it on DVD.",7,14,33,21 November 2014
The Monuments Men," True & Informative Story of World War 2
","I saw The Monuments Men', starring George Clooney-Gravity, Roseanne- t.v.; Matt Damon-True Grit-2010, The Talented Mr. Ripley; Bill Murray- Zombieland, Charlie's Angels-2000; Cate Blanchett-The Hobbit movies, The Talented Mr. Ripley and John Goodman-The Hangover Part 3, Roseanne-t.v.. This is a World War 2 movie that is based on a true story and is directed by George Clooney. It shows the importance of art in civilization. During the war, Hitler had his Nazis Stormtroopers confiscate any valuable art work that they came across in their march across Europe. It seems that Hitler wanted to build a Fuhrer Museum and wanted to stock it with only the best pieces. When the war started turning against him, he gave an order to destroy all of the art work, if he was to die. George was an art historian that went to President Roosevelt with his plan to go in and save as many of the masterpieces as possible. Matt, Bill and John are some of the men that he gathered to go into Germany, shortly after the Normandy Invasion. Like George, they were not military men but engineers and museum directors. Cate worked in a French museum, during the German occupancy, and could help identify certain art pieces. During their treasure hunts, George and his men discovered something unexpected that helped shorten the war. FYI: at the very end of the movie, keep an eye out for the actor that plays George, as an older man. He is George's real life father, Nick. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes. It was informative-I was not familiar with a lot of the facts-but I don't think that I would buy it on DVD. It would be a good rental.",Null,6,10,8 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Intense Real-Life Thriller
","I saw 'Captain Phillips', starring Tom Hanks-Cloud Atlas, Turner & Hooch; Barkhad Abdi-this is his first movie; Catherine Keener-Where the Wild Things Are, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Max Martini-Pacific Rim, The Unit-t.v.This is based on the true story of the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in 200 years. It takes place in 2009, off the coast of Africa, with the hijackers being Somalian pirates. Tom is the American merchant captain of the ship that is targeted by Barkhad and his buddies. The ship does not carry any weapons, either personal or otherwise, so they are easy targets. Catherine has a small role as Tom's wife and Max is the leader of the SEAL team that is called in to handle the situation. Even though I knew the outcome of the tense drama-I remember the story in the news-it was still an edge-of-the-seat thriller. Both Tom and the newcomer Barkhad gave great performances and I can see Oscar nominations for the two of them. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",7,0,5,11 October 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Related, But Not Really A Sequel
","I saw '10 Cloverfield Lane', starring John Goodman-Love the Coopers, Speed Racer; Mary Elizabeth Winstead-A Good Day to Die Hard, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and John Gallagher Jr.-The Newsroom_tv, Jonah Hex. This is a weird movie to talk about. J. J. Abrams is the producer and said that he did not want the audience to know a lot about the movie before seeing it. He said that a lot of trailers give away the whole plot of a movie. That is why most people don't know much about the plot of this movie. Is it a sequel to Cloverfield? Well, it is related, but only loosely, at least so far. I say so far because once you see the ending, you know there will probably be a sequel and they could explain everything in it. This one is not shot using the hand-held camera gimmick from the first movie-Thank Goodness! There is also no giant creature terrorizing the city, although you do see a small creature of some kind, near the end. From what I could tell, this one also takes place several years after the first one. Mary is driving on a country road when she has an accident. She wakes up in an underground bunker chained to the wall. She finds out that John Goodman came across her crash site and brought her back to the bunker. He tells her that there is radiation outside from an unknown attack-Russians, Iranians, or maybe even Aliens?-and it is unsafe to leave the bunker. John Gallagher is also already in the bunker but not a prisoner. Slowly, Mary starts to feel that John Goodman may not be telling her the whole truth about his actions-he does act a little weird at times and his facts don't always make sense. FYI: When Mary gets a message from her boyfriend at the beginning of the movie you might want to see if you recognize the voice; it's Bradley Cooper. By the way, the title of the movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane, is the address of the bunker. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. I enjoyed it but I wished it had a better ending-Like I said earlier, I'm sure they are setting things up for the next installment-I would buy it on DVD.",7,0,3,11 March 2016
The Finest Hours," Incredible Heroic True Story
","I saw 'The Finest Hours', starring Chris Pine-Kirk in the new Star Trek movies, Unstoppable; Casey Affleck-Interstellar, the American Pie movies, and yes, he is Ben's brother; Holliday Grainger-Cinderella_2015, The Borgias_tv and Eric Bana-Star Trek_2009, Hulk_2003.This is based on a true story about the U.S. Coast Guard's most daring rescue mission. It happened in 1952, off the coast of New England and Cape Cod, where 2 oil tankers-in close but separate locations-split in half due to the violent stormy weather. Chris is a by the book Coast Guard seaman that has just gotten engaged to his rather brassy-for that period of time anyway-girlfriend, Holliday. She is the one who proposed to him. Eric is the commander in chief at the Coast Guard station that Chris is stationed and sends Chris and 3 other volunteers out on a 12 man boat to rescue the survivors of one of the ships. Casey is the chief engineer on the boat that Chris is headed for and Casey is doing his best to keep the ship from sinking-it is split in half, remember? Everyone thinks Chris is on a suicide mission, what with being in such a small boat in such bad weather. And even if Chris makes it to the rapidly sinking ship in time, how can he rescue 32 men on his boat that is built for 12, including him and his 3 fellow rescuers? It is an interesting and thrilling story, especially since it is true. I enjoyed it. It's rated 'PG-13' for sequences of peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a great rental.",7,1,9,29 January 2016
The Equalizer," Good Action Movie
","I saw 'The Equalizer', starring Denzel Washington-The Book of Eli, St. Elsewhere_tv; Chloe Grace Moretz-Carrie_2013, the Kick Ass movies; David Meunier-Justified_tv, The Incredible Hulk_2008 and Marton Csokas-The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Bourne Supremacy.This is based on the 1985-1989 TV series of the same name that starred Edward Woodward. If you are not a TV nut like I am, you probably have never heard of it, but I used to enjoy it. The basic premise is that the Equalizer is a retired spy that helps people that the police can not. The movie is directed by Antoine Fuqua, who also did Olympus Has Fallen and Training Day. Denzel plays Robert McCall, a retired spy that now works at Home Mart, a hardware store-I guess they could not use the name, Home Depot. You can tell that he has OCD-obsessive compulsive disorder-and likes to keep on a tight time schedule-he is always checking his watch and timing things. He befriends Chloe, a hooker that wants to be a singer. David is her Russian pimp and slaps her around a little but makes a big mistake of doing it in front of Denzel. After Denzel shows David some of his old skills, the Russian mobster's boss sends Marton from the motherland to take care of Denzel. The movie is a little slow at first-like most good origin stories are-but when it gets going, the action is good and violent-just the way I like my action movies. It ends with a sequel in mind and they even tip their hat to the TV show by showing how he gets future clients. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual situations-no nudity- and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,1,7,26 September 2014
War Dogs," Interesting
","I saw 'War Dogs', starring Jonah Hill-The 21 Jump Street movies, Django Unchained; Miles Teller-The Divergent movies, Footloose_2011; Ana De Armas-Hands of Stone, Exposed; Kevin Pollak-Angel From Hell_tv, End of Days and Bradley Cooper-Joy, All About Steve.This movie is based on a true story about 2 young men-in their earlier 20's-living in Miami Beach, that sold guns & ammo to the American Allies in Afghanistan in the 1980's. Jonah and Miles play the 2 childhood friends that get into the fascinating world of gun running. They started small and worked their way up to a $300 million contract with the U.S. government. Ana plays Miles wife. FYI: the real life person that Miles is portraying makes a cameo appearance in the movie as the guitar player in the old folks home that is singing, 'Don't Fear the Reaper' by BOC. Kevin plays a small businessman that backs the boys-financially-on some of their deals in return for a cut. Bradley plays another arms dealer that does business with Jonah & Miles. Bradley is on a 'Watch' list, so he can't do business with the government himself. Some parts of the movie are interesting, some are predictable. There are lots of recognizable music in the soundtrack; I remember hearing songs by Vanilla Fudge, Aerosmith, The James Gang, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Wolfmother and The Who. It's rated 'R' for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",6,1,2,28 August 2016
Iron Man 3," Great Sequel to The Avengers
","I saw 'Iron Man 3' , starring Robert Downey Jr.-besides the Iron Man & Avengers movies , you might have seen him in The Shaggy Dog-2006 or Natural Born Killers , Gwyneth Paltrow-Contagion , Shallow Hal , Don Cheadle-House of Lies-t.v. , Hotel for Dogs , Guy Pearce-Prometheus , The Hurt Locker and Ben Kingsley-Hugo , The Love Guru . This is more of a sequel to 'The Avengers' , rather than 'Iron Man 2' . Robert is suffering from anxiety and sleepless nights after the events in New York and is spending all his time working on his Iron Man toys-you get to see lots of new suits . Gwyneth has become his live-in girlfriend and runs the daily business of Stark Inc. but is feeling ignored by Robert . Don has gotten a paint job & new name as the Iron Patriot-War Machine sounded too threatening . The villains are Guy-who runs an organization called A.I.M. and Ben-he is the Mandarin , an international terrorist with ten rings of varying powers on his fingers . There are lots of nods to the comics-such as Extremis but you don't have to had read the books to know what is going on . Of course , there is a scene after the credits , so stay seated . It is shown in regular digital , 3D and IMAX 3D-that's the one I saw it in . It's rated 'PG-13' for the violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes . I thoroughly enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray .",9,4,11,3 May 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Better Than I Was Expecting
","I saw 'Deepwater Horizon', starring Mark Wahlberg-Daddy's Home, Boogie Nights; Kurt Russell-The Hateful Eight, Tango & Cash; Kate Hudson- Mother's Day, Glee_tv and John Malkovich-The Red movies, Jonah Hex.This movie is based on a true story about the offshore oil drilling rig- Deepwater Horizon-that was responsible for the biggest oil spill in U.S. history. It happened in April of 2010. It's directed by Peter Berg, a former actor himself who has directed Lone Survivor, Hancock & Friday Night Lights, just to name a few, and he directs this movie just like it was an action packed disaster movie. This also marks the first time that Kate has worked on screen with her step-father, Kurt. I was a little familiar with the incident but this goes into more of the details that led up to the disaster. Mark & Kurt work on the oil rig that is about 50 miles off shore. Kate plays Mark's wife and John is the corporate BP executive that is more interested in profits than anything else. Kurt is the boss of the rig and when John pushes for results-they are 43 days behind schedule-corners are cut and safety precautions are ignored. Besides the approximate 5 million barrels of oil that leaked during the ecological disaster, 11 people died and they are acknowledged as the end credits start with their names and photos. FYI: If you are a country music fan, keep an eye out for Trace Adkins-some know him as Tracy Adkins but in the credits, he uses Trace. He has a small cameo near the end of the movie-he picks Mark up and shakes him pretty violently. It's rated 'PG-13' for intense disaster sequences, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. Although I don't think I would buy it on DVD, it was better than I was expecting it to be and it would be a great rental.",7,2,4,30 September 2016
Deja Vu," Interesting Action Flick
","Denzel Washington plays an ATF cop that gets involved in a suspected terrorist bombing of a ferry boat , carrying about 500 military personnel & their friends & families on board . James Caviezel plays the terrorist that thinks of himself as a patriot ; don't they all ? Val Kilmer is the F.B.I. agent that gets Denzel involved in the case because of Denzel's keen sense of observation . Bruce Greenwood plays the head of a top-secret new project , that is able to see into the past . But , of course , there are limitations on their surveillance capabilities .

It," Scarier/More Violent Than The Original
","I saw 'It', starring Jaeden Lieberher-Midnight Special, St. Vincent; Sophia Lillis-37, A Midsummer Night's Dream; Finn Wolfhard-Stranger Things_tv, The 100_tv and Bill Skarsgard-Atomic Blonde, Allegiant.This is a remake of the 1990 TV miniseries that is based on a story by Stephen King. If you haven't seen the original or if you are unfamiliar with it, it tells the story of an evil monster-in the book, he was an alien but that fact is never mentioned here-that terrorizes the town of Derry, Maine, every 27 years. He is a shape shifter but prefers to take the form of Pennywise, the dancing clown. Bill does a fantastic job in the role of Pennywise. FYI: If Bill's name is unfamiliar to you, you might know his father, Stellan-Avengers, Thor- or his brother, Alexander-the recent Tarzan movie, The Legend of Tarzan. Jaeden, Sophia and Finn are some of the kids that are tortured by Bill as he feasts on their fears and phobias. If you are familiar with the original miniseries, this version is a lot scarier and violent. There are some scenes that were in the original-such as the floating boat scene at the beginning-but are much more graphic here- there is no doubt as to what happens to little Georgie. Now, there is some humor scattered between the horror, mostly in the dialogue between the kids, but make no mistake, this is not one you want to bring your little children to see-and I saw some people that brought their little tykes to the theater. Also, this movie focuses on the kids' story and does not jump into the adult lives of the characters- want to bet there will be a sequel? Another hint to a sequel is at the end, when on the screen appears 'It Chapter One'. It's rated 'R' for violence/horror, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes. I really enjoyed 'It' and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,6,13,8 September 2017
Hereditary," More Weird Than Scary
","I saw 'Hereditary', starring Toni Collette-XXX:Return of Xander Cage, Tammy; Gabriel Byrne-The 33, End of Days; Alex Wolff-Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle, Patriots Day and Milly Shapiro-this is her movie debut.
This is a horror movie that is more weird than scary. It has it's moments but then something will happen that just doesn't make sense. Toni & Gabriel are a married couple with two kids, Alex & Milly. Toni's mother dies after a long illness but most of the family members don't seem to care that much about their loss-Toni was estranged from her mother. The only one that got along with the elderly lady was Milly, and Milly is a little off herself-she likes to draw weird pictures, cut the heads off of dead birds and then put them in her pocket. Oh yeah, she also likes to make a strange clicking noise with her mouth. Oh yeah, the loosing heads bit is a recurring theme throughout the movie-more than one person looses their head before it's all over. Toni even goes to counseling to find out why she doesn't care about her mother and unravels past secrets that are being passed down through her and her family-I guess that hereditary issues are the hardest ones to correct.
It's rated 'R' for horror violence, disturbing images, language, drug use and nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes.
It's not one that I'd buy on DVD. It would be alright, as a rental.",6,0,6,9 June 2018
If I Stay," Cliché' Filled Tear-Jerker
","I saw 'If I Stay', starring Chloe Grace Moretz-The Kick-Ass movies, The Amityville Horror_2005; Jamie Blackley-The Fifth Estate, Snow White and the Huntsman; Joshua Leonard-Shark Night 3D, The Blair Witch Project; Mireille Enos-The Killing_t.v., World War Z and Stacy Keach-Sin City:A Dame to Kill For, The Bourne Legacy.If you know me, I am not the target audience for this movie; That would be a teenage girl. But I went to see it because I like some of the actors in it, plus, and this is the big factor, I had to work inventory today for about an hour and the times were right for this showing, with the other movies being about two hours later. Anyway, this is a teen love story, based on a book for teens that was written by Gayle Forman and it really tugs at the old heartstrings; I heard lots of sobbing throughout the theater so if you take a date/wife to see this one, you better have some Kleenex with you. Chloe is a 17 year old cellist that hopes to study at Julliard-she loves classical music and no, I don't mean classical rock, she plays a cello for goodness sakes. Jamie plays her slightly older love interest that heads up a rock band that is on the verge of hitting it big. Joshua and Mireille play Chloe's parents who are old-school rockers-code meaning cool parents-and Stacey plays her grandpa. The tears start flowing when the Chloe family is in a car wreck, putting Chloe in a coma and killing the rest of her family-I'm not giving anything away here, it's all in the trailers. Chloe becomes a ghost-like out of body version of herself-she can see everything but no one can see or hear her. Flashbacks show the happy and the not so happy times in Chloe's life and the tough decisions she has to make. First and foremost, should she go back into her body and rejoin the living? Then, should she go across the country to Julliard and possibly loose the love of her life? What do you think? Most of the story is cliché' filled drama that you can see plot developments coming from a mile off. It's rated 'PG' for sexual situations-no nudity-and drug/alcohol use and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. It's not one that I would buy or even rent. If you are a teen age girl, then you might enjoy it. Otherwise, I would wait until it comes to cable.",5,5,12,22 August 2014
Detroit," Emotional & Moving
","I saw 'Detroit', starring John Boyega-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, 24:Live Another Day_tv; Will Poulter-The Revenant, We're the Millers; Kaitlyn Dever-Last Man Standing_tv, Bad Teacher and Anthony Mackie-The Captain America & Avengers movies, Real Steel.This is based on a true story that took place in July of 1967 in Detroit, Michigan. It's directed by Kathryn Bigelow-Zero Dark Thirty, The Hurt Locker & Point Break, the original 1991 version. It tells the story of police brutality, racism and riots, all of which happened much too often during this time period. John plays a security guard that gets involved with local police, state police and the National Guard in a shooting incident that happened at the Algiers Motel-it was an eleven dollar a day motel so most of the clients were hookers or drug dealers. The local police-mostly white-had just raided a bar and arrested almost everyone there-mostly black. This led to riots throughout the city, which led to the Algiers incident. Will is the racist white police officer that leads the charge on the motel after hearing gun shots-he thinks it's a sniper-and rounds up the occupants-mostly black with 2 white females. Kaitlyn is one of the females. Anthony plays a returning war vet that was in the motel. If you are unfamiliar with the incident, it had several deaths, brutal police beatings and a trial. Oh yeah, they never found a gun. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD. It is an emotional and moving story but one viewing is enough. It would be a good rental.",7,4,11,6 August 2017
John Wick," Action Fan's Wet Dream
","I saw 'John Wick', starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies, Speed; Michael Nyqvist-Mission:Impossible_Ghost Protocol, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_2009, Willem Dafoe-The Fault in Our Stars, John Carter and Adrianne Palicki-G.I.Joe:Retaliation, Red Dawn_2012.If you like action movies, then you should love this one-I did. It's directed by a couple of newcomers, David Leitch & Chad Stahelski, who have worked as stunt men on the Matrix movies with Keanu. Keanu plays a retired assassin-yeah,like they can ever just retire-that gets married, then his wife dies and then he gets sucked back into the business. His nickname when he was working was The Boogeyman. Michael plays a Russian mob boss that has a stupid son; his son steals Keanu's car and kills Keanu's dog-see? stupid. I know, the plot sounds like it could be a great country music song; He looses his wife, he looses his car and then he looses his dog. But the plot is not the best part of this movie. It's the action. The fights are incredible, as well as the gun play. Willem plays a former associate to Keanu-he used to give Keanu his assignments, back before he retired and Adrianne plays a fellow assassin, that wants in on the action. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,7,22,24 October 2014
Rocketman," Bohemian Was Better
","I saw Rocketman', starring Taron Egerton-The Kingsman movies, Eddie the Eagle; Jamie Bell-Fantastic Four_2015, King Kong_2005; Bryce Dallas Howard-The Jurassic World movies, The Help and Richard Madden-Game of Thrones_tv, Cinderella_2015.
This is a musical fantasy biography of Elton John's life. I guess there will be more bio pics of musicians since the success of Bohemian Rhapsody but I liked Bohemian better. I like Elton John's music and Taron-who plays Elton-does his own singing here, unlike what they did in Bohemian. But the story is a little on the strange side. It starts with Taron/Elton going to a meeting for people with problems-You know the kind that start with, 'Hi, My name is Elton. I'm an alcoholic/drug addict/sex addict/shopaholic/etc.' The rest of the movie is flashbacks leading up to this moment. All of this is fine and dandy except that they use fantasy sequences that go into musical numbers and dancing frenzies so that you get to when you don't know what is real and what isn't. The music is good and I think Taron does a good job. Jamie plays Taron's writing partner Bernie Taupin-Bernie would write the songs and Elton would supply the music-and they had a good deal going on. Bryce plays Taron's mother and Richard plays a music producer. If you are a big fan of Elton John, you might like it more than I did-I'm a moderate fan-but don't take the kiddies. There are several sex scenes-no actual nudity but there is some partial and insinuated stuff-and some language. During the end credits, they will show a scene from the movie with Taron and then an actual scene of Elton, side by side so that you can compare how they captured the moment.
It's rated 'R' for language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I might buy the soundtrack, though. Unless you are a big fan of Elton, I would just rent it.",6,13,33,2 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Better Than I Was Anticipating But Not One I'd Buy
","I saw 'A Star Is Born', starring Lady Gaga-American Horror Story_tv, Machete Kills; Bradley Cooper-War Dogs, All About Steve; Sam Elliott-Up In The Air, Road House and Andrew Dice Clay-One Night At McCool's, Amazon Women On The Moon.
This is about the 4th remake of this movie-the first was in 1937 with Janet Gaynor & Fredric March, the second was in 1954 with Judy Garland & James Mason and the third was in 1976 with Barbara Streisand & Kris Kristofferson-and one of the stars of this one, Bradley, is also directing it, in his first time directing a movie. For those unfamiliar with the other versions, Bradley plays an aging rock star that discovers Lady G, an up and coming singer, that is just looking for her big break. She is working in a restaurant while singing part time in a bar at night. Bradley decides to take her under his wing and help her get a leg up in the industry but he has his own demons to fight, including alcohol and drug abuse as well as family problems. As Bradley's career is spiraling downwards Lady G's starts getting more popular. Sam plays Bradley's brother/manager and Andrew plays Lady G's father. I read that both Bradley and Lady G did their own singing live during the filming of the movie-it was suggested by Lady G that it would make it look more authentic. There are a few cameos; I remember seeing Alec Baldwin and Dave Chappelle and Lukas Nelson-Yep, Willie's son-taught Bradley how to play the guitar and also wrote some of the songs that are performed in the film. I wasn't expecting it to be very good but it was a little better than I anticipated.
It's rated 'R' for language, alcohol & drug abuse and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright as a rental.",7,7,14,8 October 2018
Gravity," Good-Looking Disaster-in-Space Movie
","I saw 'Gravity', starring George Clooney-The Men Who Stare at Goats, Return of the Killer Tomatoes and Sandra Bullock-The Heat, Love Potion No. 9.This is a sci-fi disaster-in-space movie starring George as the retiring veteran astronaut that is trying to set a new record of walking in space and Sandra as the newby scientist that is on her first outer space mission. They are the only two actors in the entire movie, well, another one is shown from a distance very quickly and there are a couple of voices-on-the-radio actors but George and Sandra are basically the entire cast. George and Sandra are in space, outside of their ship that is circling the Earth, performing their experiments, when tragedy strikes in the form of a shower of flying space debris. They have to scramble for safety as best as they can and that is basically the whole movie, them trying to survive. It has great special effects, such as the zero gravity and that makes this the right movie for 3D, but story wise, it was just a little bland. It's rated 'PG-13' for some disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",6,16,33,4 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Realistic Looking SEAL Mission
","I saw 'Lone Survivor', starring Mark Wahlberg-2 Guns, Ted; Taylor Kitsch-Savages, Snakes on a Plane; Emile Hirsch-Savages, Alpha Dog; Ben Foster-The Mechanic-2011, Alpha Dog and Eric Bana-Hanna, Black Hawk Down.This movie is based on a true story that was written by Marcus Luttrell, the only surviving Navy SEAL team member of a mission in Afghanistan in 2005-and I'm not giving anything away here by saying only surviving member, look at the title of the movie-and he also has a cameo in an early scene of the film. It's directed by Peter Berg-Battleship, Hancock, The Kingdom-with a realistic looking, no holds barred approach. The movie starts by showing some of the training the SEALs actually go through, and through-out the rest of the movie, you get the sense of the type of person it takes to become a SEAL. The mission for SEAL Team 10 was to go in and kill a high ranking Taliban leader in Afghanistan. Mark plays Marcus, with Taylor, Emile and Ben rounding out the 4 man squad. Eric was the military officer giving them their orders. After they made their drop behind enemy lines, the problems began. There were more Taliban holed up at the location than they expected. They ran into goat herders-rules of engagement were argued here-and due to the mountains, they had problems with their radios. Pretty soon, they were in a pretty lop-sided fire fight. I must say that these were some of the most realistic looking battle scenes that I have ever seen. FYI: During the end credits, there are photographs of Marcus and other soldiers shown, and on a side note, Marcus is from Houston. It's rated 'R' for the bloody violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. I enjoyed it and felt proud of our military and I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",8,4,14,10 January 2014
Wind River," Extended Episode of a TV Series
","I saw 'Wind River', starring Jeremy Renner-The Avengers movies, American Hustle; Elizabeth Olsen-The Avengers movies, Godzilla_2014; Graham Greene-Longmire_tv, the Twilight movies and Jon Bernthal-Baby Driver, The Walking Dead_tv.This is a murder mystery that takes place on a Native American reservation in Wyoming. It is based on true events. An 18 year old Indian girl is found dead out on the snow covered mountains by Jeremy, the local wild game tracker. Jeremy was married to an Indian woman, had a daughter with her and then she too disappeared, under mysterious circumstances, years earlier. An F.B.I. agent, Elizabeth, is called in to run the investigation-she was the closest agent at the time-and does not have any experience with tracking in the snow, so she enlists Jeremy to assist her. Graham plays the reservation police chief and Jon is an oil worker that just might be a person of interest. It's not a bad movie. It's kind of like an extended version of a TV series with more violence. Just before the end credits start, a statement appears on screen saying something to the effect that the government does not keep statistics on girls that disappear from reservations so there is no way to know how many have actually disappeared. It's rated 'R' for violence, a rape scene, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.",7,0,5,20 August 2017
Fury," Dirty Half Dozen-Minus One
","I saw 'Fury', starring Brad Pitt-World War Z, Thelma & Louise; Shia LaBeouf-the Transformers movies, Constantine; Logan Lerman-Noah, The Butterfly Effect; Michael Pena-End of Watch, Battle Los Angeles and Jon Bernthal-The Wolf of Wall Street, The Walking Dead_t.v.This is a WW2 movie that reminded me of an old Sgt.Fury & His Howling Commandoes comic book. If you like WW2 movies-and I like good ones-it has all the elements needed, including a tough leader, Brad, taking his men into battle against those dirty old Nazis in April of 1945 in Germany, during the last few weeks of WW2. Brad is in charge of a Sherman tank called Fury-it's painted on the barrel of the tank-and everyone has appropriate, descriptive nicknames. Brad is Wardaddy, and his squad includes Shia_Bible, Michael_Gordo and Jon_Coon-Ass. After loosing a fifth man in a heated battle-they were the only survivors to hobble back to base-Logan joins the team. The only problem is that Logan has only been enlisted in the Army for about 8 weeks and he was a clerk. It doesn't take long for Logan to discover the true meaning of the old saying, War is Hell. The battles are really brutal, in a Saving Private Ryan way. In the opening scene, Brad takes out a German soldier on a horse that brought several squeals from the audience in my theater-Brad does not use a gun. There is a 4 on 1 tank battle-4 Shermans against 1 Tiger-that is pretty engaging. But, if you have a weak stomach, you may not enjoy this one; one of Logan's first duties is to take a bucket of water and clean his seat in the tank-where his fallen predecessor once sat-and not only is there blood everywhere but even chunks of flesh and body organs. I saw a few of the actors on talk shows saying how they were encouraged by the director to get into actual fist fights with each other before filming a scene. He said it would help the actors bond with each other. It seems to have worked. The movie ends ala Alamo style with Brad's Dirty Five taking on about 200 German soldiers in a spectacular and bloody battle. It's rated 'R' for violence, grisly images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. I enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,10,17 October 2014
Darkest Hour," Movie Critics Will Love It
","I saw 'Darkest Hour', starring Gary Oldman-The Hitman's Bodyguard, The Dark Knight Rises; Lily James-Baby Driver, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies; Ben Mendelsohn-Rogue One:A Star Wars Story, The Dark Knight Rises and Kristen Scott Thomas-Only God Forgives, The Horse Whisperer.
This movie covers about a month's length of time in 1940 when Winston Churchill became the British Prime Minister. Gary plays Winston and does a great job, with the help of some good make up and padding-I can see Oscar nominations in his future because critics love this kind of stuff. Gary is very convincing in his portrayal, covering Winston's mannerisms, heavy drinking, smoking and his unpredictability-he actually would scare people, intentionally or not, including even the King of England. Ben plays the King. Kristin is Gary's wife and Lily plays the secretary that follows Gary around and gets to type all of his speeches, sometimes in awkward places. I enjoyed the scene where Gary rides a subway with regular English people and he asked them about how they felt about the war and Hitler. It also covers more of the background and wheelings & dealings behind the famous evacuation of Dunkirk-just recently seen in the movie, 'Dunkirk'. I enjoyed the humor, too, but I must admit, this is not my favorite type of movie. I prefer more action and this one lacks in that department. But, as I've said many times before, people are different and they like different types of movies, so I'm sure there are people that will like this one better than I did-FYI: I didn't really care that much for 'Dunkirk', but lots of people loved it.
It's rated 'PG-13'for thematic material and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would make a good rental if you are interested in the material.",7,1,4,8 January 2018
The Maze Runner," Lord of the Flies Meets Lost
","I saw 'The Maze Runner', starring Dylan O'Brien-Teen Wolf_tv, The Internship; Will Poulter-We're the Millers, Son of Rambow; Kaya Scodelario-The Truth About Emanuel, Clash of the Titans_2010 and Patricia Clarkson-Friends With Benefits, Blind Date.This is based on a series of young adults books by James Dashner-so you can look for a franchise. The story kind of reminded me of if you mixed the plots of the Lord of the Flies with the TV show Lost. The movie starts with Dylan as he wakes up in a moving elevator. When it stops, he is in the middle of an open field-which he finds out is called the glades-with a group of other young men standing around him. He has no memories of who he is or how he got there, just like the other boys before him-but after a few days, they do remember their own names-and once a month, a new boy arrives and the first boy that arrived there has been there for 3 years. Encircling the open field is a giant wall that Dylan later discovers is a maze. Every morning, an opening in the wall appears and then closes when the sun goes down. During this time, the boys send runners into the maze to try to find a way out, but if they do not make it out by sunset, they are never seen again. At night, strange noises are heard from the maze which is attributed to these sort of nighttime watchdogs called grievers, which are half robot, half scorpion monsters. Will is one of the earlier memory erased arrivals that does not like Dylan-he is always wanting to punish Dylan and gets disappointed when no one else agrees with him. Kaya is the first girl that arrives in the elevator-after Dylan-and she seems to know Dylan, if not much else. Patricia plays the person behind the curtain that seems to know exactly what is going on and why. The action is pretty good but the story left lots of questions unanswered, but I'm sure they are leaving them for the sequels. It ends like it is setting up the next installment. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,4,7,19 September 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Stand Alone Treat
","I saw 'Rogue One:A Star Wars Story', starring Felicity Jones-Inferno, The Theory of Everything; Diego Luna-Elysium, Open Range; Alan Tudyk- Suburgatory_tv, Serenity; Mads Mikkelsen-Hannibal_tv, Casino Royale_2006; Forest Whitaker-Arrival, Taken 3 and Ben Mendelsohn-The Dark Knight Rises, Quigley Down Under.If you are a Star Wars fan, you are in for a treat. This is a stand alone film-I'm pretty sure there will not be a sequel because it leads right into Episode 4:A New Hope. It has all the elements a fan could want in a Star Wars movie. If you remember the opening scene in the 1977 classic Star Wars film where a scroll going across the screen tells us about some rebel fighters that stole the plans to the Death Star and gave them to Princess Leia. This movie tells that story. In case you might be wondering, there is not a scroll going across the beginning of this movie. Felicity is the daughter of Mads, the scientist that created the Death Star-under duress, of course. They were separated when she was still a little girl and she was raised to be a fighter by Forest. Mads was put to work for the Empire by Ben. Years later, the rebel alliance comes up with a plan to use Felicity to lead them to Mads and either rescue him or kill him to prevent the Death Star from being completed. Diego is in charge of the mission to rescue-or kill-her father and of course, he forgets to tell her about the killing option. Alan plays a robot called K-2so who was formerly an Empire robot but has been reprogrammed to be a good guy. FYI: They use motion capture technology for Alan to play the robot and he is fantastic in the part. There is lots of action, both man to man and space ship to space ship. There are lots of characters from other Star Wars movies that pop up. I won't spoil all of them for you here but if you have seen the trailer, then you know that one of them is Darth Vader. And they do use James Earl Jones for his voice-Thank Goodness. And a couple of the characters popping up were a little surprising-one in particular, since the actor that played him died in 1994! And then I read that they used CGI to fake it. It did look pretty good, though, I must say. FYI: Darth Vader does not have a lot of screen time but he does have a kick-ass fight scene including showing off his expertise with a light saber. If you are a fan then you should enjoy this movie-I know I did, immensely. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. I loved 'The Force Awakens' and I believe this one is just as good. I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,3,10,16 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Plenty Of Action To Go Around
","I saw 'Captain Marvel', starring Brie Larson-Kong:Skull Island, 21 Jump Street_2012; Samuel L. Jackson-Glass, Kong:Skull Island; Ben Mendelsohn-Robin Hood_2018, The Dark Knight Rises; Jude Law-Fantastic Beasts:The Crimes of Grindelwald, Spy and Annette Bening-Rules Don't Apply, Open Range.
This movie is based on the Marvel comic book character, not the original Captain Marvel that is now being published by DC comics-he goes by the name of Shazam ever since they lost the name rites to Marvel's character, but that's another story. Brie plays Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel. The movie is set in 1995 and you learn through flashbacks and memories her origin story. Samuel is Nick Fury and he-as well as another actor-is de_aged digitally so that he looks younger and he has both of his eyes. You do learn what happened that made him wear the eye patch-at least according to the MCU, aka Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's not the same as in the original comics. Story wise, there is a big galactic war going on between two alien races called the Kree and the Skrulls. Jude is the Kree soldier that trained Brie and Ben is the leader of the Skrulls, a shape_shifting race. Annette plays the Supreme Intelligence, an A.I. that gives the Kree their marching orders. Both races are competing to find a certain item of power and it just so happens to be hidden on Earth, so there is plenty of action to go around. I remember hearing some music by No Doubt and Nirvana among some others. The opening Marvel Studios logo-the one that usually shows lots of different Marvel characters-is a little different, focusing on only one person, and it is not Captain Marvel. Stan Lee has his usual brief cameo-filmed before he died in 2018-and I've heard he will have his last one in the Avengers End Game. There are two scenes as the end credits start; one is right after the credits start, and it includes several Avengers and it is connected to the Infinity War and the other one is at the very end and it is comical, involving a character named Goose.
It's rated 'PG-13' for sci fi violence & action and some mild language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes.
It was a little confusing at times, because of the flashbacks and memory scenes but it did make sense in the end.
Overall, I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",8,4,9,9 March 2019
This Is the End," Funny Vulgar Comedy
","I saw 'This is the End', starring Seth Rogen-The Guilt Trip, Pineapple Express, Jay Baruchel-She's Out of My League, Tropic Thunder, James Franco-Oz the Great and Powerful, Milk, Jonah Hill-21 Jump Street-2012, Superbad and Craig Robinson-Hot Tub Time Machine, Pineapple Express. This is a comedy where the actors all use their real names and there are lots of cameos. Seth picks up his buddy Jay at the airport, where both are recognized by paparazzi-one even asks Seth to give him the 'Seth laugh'. They head over to James' house, where a party is going on with lots of celebrities-one funny one, in particular, is rather rowdy. Jonah and Craig are already there, enjoying some drinking and the drugs. Then, all Hell breaks loose, literally. Earthquakes, explosions, people getting sucked up, into the sky as if it was the apocalypse come to life-you know, the rapture. The guys decide the safest place is in James' house, where they fight off any enemies that show up on their doorstep, including humans & monsters. The humor is often vulgar and raunchy but it is funny. As far as music goes, I remember hearing 2 Black Sabbath songs; one old one-War Pigs and one new one-End of the Beginning, which is off of their just released CD '13', available at stores everywhere. There is also a famous musical group that makes an appearance and they perform, but I'm not a fan of them-like they say, everyone has different tastes. It's rated 'R' for sexual content-including nudity, drug use, language-lots of language and violence-lots of celebrities die and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. I laughed a lot and I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",8,5,20,14 June 2013
World War Z," Fast Zombies
","I saw 'World War Z', starring Brad Pitt-Inglourious Basterds, Fight Club, Mireille Enos-The Killing-t.v., Gangster Squad, & FYI: She was also born in Houston, James Badge Dale-Iron Man 3, The Grey and David Morse-The Hurt Locker, The Green Mile.This is a Zombie movie; that is what the 'Z' in the title of the film stands for. It is also one of the newer zombie films that uses a fast moving zombie instead of the usual slow-moving kind. The film is based on a series of books so if box office goes well, you can expect a sequel or two. Brad plays an investigator that works for the United Nations. Mireille plays his wife. They are together with their two little girls in the city when the zombie attack hits. They barely get out of the city alive, with the help of Brad's UN buddies, who then want Brad to do some of his investigating and find out how to stop the zombie plague. James plays a soldier and David is someone with C.I.A. connections that also might have some information about the source of the infection. In most monster movies, they have rules; some use the same rules as everyone else and some make up their own-like in some vampire movies that I know. Anyway, after being bitten by a zombie in this film, you have about ten seconds before you turn into one. As I mentioned before,the zombies here are very fast, with several scenes that reminded me of ants. If you are faint of heart about zombie eating habits, you don't have to worry. I do not remember seeing any mutilations. Most of the time, they would just bite and cover their victims-like ants- so you don't see body parts flying in different directions. The ending is definitely left open for a sequel-You even hear a character on screen say something like,'It ain't over. It's only begun.' It's rated 'PG-13' for the violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. If you like zombie movies, then you should enjoy this one. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,5,13,21 June 2013
Passengers," Romantic Sci-Fi
","I saw 'Passengers', starring Jennifer Lawrence-The Hunger Games movies, The X-Men movies; Chris Pratt-Guardians of the Galaxy, Jennifer's Body; Michael Sheen-Nocturnal Animals, The Underworld movies and Laurence Fishburne-Black-ish_tv, Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice.This is a romantic sci-fi movie-Fun fact, Jennifer got 20 million for her payday whereas Chris only got 10 million. Jennifer and Chris are among the 5,000 passengers and 380 crew members aboard a space ship headed to colonize a distant planet. It will take 120 years to get there so everyone is in suspended animation. The ship is on auto pilot. Something goes wrong after 30 years and Chris wakes up. After he realizes what happened, he tries to go back into his sleep pod but he can't get it to work. Then he decides to check out the accommodations of the ship, since he still has 90 years before he will reach the planet, and he finds things quite comfortable. Plenty of places to eat and drink, exercise rooms, gaming rooms. Heck, there is even a robot bartender, played by Michael. But after about a year, he starts getting bored and stir crazy. I mean you can only eat, drink, exercise, play games and talk to a robot for so much before you start getting suicidal thoughts. That is when he finds Jennifer's pod. He starts visiting her and reading about her from the files in the ship's computer-she is a journalist-and then he wrestles with a dilemma; he is an engineer so he could mess with her pod and wake her up for some companionship, but then, she would die, like himself, long before they reached their destination. Guess which decision he makes? And guess what happens when she finds out what he did? See, the basic plot of a rom-com. Anyway, Laurence plays the pilot of the ship and his pod malfunctions too-maybe, if they waited long enough, everyone else would have a malfunction and wake up too. Laurence seems to have been put into the movie just to help Chris and Jennifer on a few little things. It's rated 'PG-13' for action/peril and sexual content-including nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I like both Chris & Jennifer and the effects are good but I don't think I would buy it on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright as a rental.",6,1,8,23 December 2016
42," Good Sport's Movie
","This is a true story , based on the life of Jackie Robinson . Chadwick plays Jackie , a baseball player in the late 1940's, right after WWII . During that time period , there was still racial prejudice and segregation-Whites & Blacks were in separate baseball leagues and did not mix . Harrison/Branch Rickey plays the Brooklyn Dodgers' team executive that hired Chadwick to play for his all white team. FYI: Harrison is pretty unrecognizable in his role . Christopher/Leo Durocher plays the team manager and Nicole/Rachel is Chadwick's wife . I'm not a big sports fan but it was a good story and sports fans will probably like it more than I did . The title of the movie, 42, is the jersey number Jackie wore . It's rated 'PG-13' for language-the N word is used a lot as well as other racist terms and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes . It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would make a good rental .",7,0,1,16 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Star Trek Fan's Delight
","I saw 'Star Trek Into Darkness' , starring Chris Pine-This Means War , Star Trek-2009, Zachary Quinto-Heroes-t.v. , Star Trek-2009, Alice Eve-Men in Black 3, She's Out of My League, Peter Weller-Screamers, Robocop and Benedict Cumberbatch-The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey , War Horse.This is the second in the series of the reboot of the classic sci-fi series Star Trek, by J.J. Abrams-Super 8, Star Trek-2009, Mission Impossible 3. Chris plays Kirk, who doesn't always play by the rules. Zachary is Spock, the unemotional logical thinking Vulcan. Peter is Admiral Marcus, in charge of Starfleet command and Alice is his daughter Carol, the newest member on the Enterprise. Benedict is the villain John Harrison, a former Starfleet cadet that has become a terrorist-You know how those disgruntled employees can get. After Benedict attacks Starfleet Headquarters, he escapes to a hidden Klingon planet, where Chris and crew pursue him and try not to start an interplanetary war with the Klingons. Along the way, there is a cameo of an original Star Trek actor, the birth of an alien species-familiar to fans of the t.v. series and the death of a major character. FYI: there is not a scene after the end credits. If you like the Star Trek universe, you should enjoy this one. It has all the necessary elements, including the humor and even some twists on it's own beloved history. It is being shown in regular 2D, 3D & IMAX 3D-that's the one I saw it in. It's rated 'PG-13' for the intense action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I really enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,4,11,17 May 2013
Green Room," Punk Version of 'Straw Dogs'
","I saw 'Green Room', starring Anton Yelchin-Chekov in the new Star Trek movies, Fright Night_2011; Imogen Poots-Need For Speed, Fright Night_2011; Alia Shawkat-Arrested Development_tv, The Runaways and Patrick Stewart-Professor X in the X-Men movies, Robin Hood:Men in Tights.This is a nice little thriller, although it is ultra violent & bloody. It kind of reminded me of a punk version of 'Straw Dogs'. Anton is in a punk band that is on the road with his band mates, just trying to make a buck. They end up at a drinking establishment that is run by Patrick and almost all of his customers look like neo-nazi skin heads that are getting all liquored up and about ready to go do some damage. After a person gets killed by one of the regulars in the green room, Anton and his band-including Alia-get trapped in the green room, AKA: the dressing room. Imogen is already in the green room-she was a witness to the murder-and she and Anton's band mates have to try to survive getting out of the bar alive, because Patrick wants to blame the death on them, a new band that is just passing through, and eliminate all the evidence. Patrick uses his nazi drinking buddies to try to get at Anton & company and one of them even has attack dogs. It's the old saying of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It does get pretty graphic in the violence department, what with a lot of stabbing and shooting and, oh yeah, the dogs tearing people to pieces. It's rated 'R' for violence, gory images, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",7,2,7,1 May 2016
Us," Tip of the Iceberg
","I saw 'Us', starring Lupita Nyongo-Black Panther, Star Wars:Episode 7_The Force Awakens; Winston Duke-Black Panther, Person of Interest_tv; Shahadi Wright Joseph-making her theatrical movie debut and Evan Alex-Mani_tv, Sesame Street_tv.
This is Jordan Peele's next movie to direct, after his successful 'Get Out'. He is also the writer and producer. I'll try not to give too much away-it's better that you don't know too much before seeing it-but what you have probably seen in the trailers is just the tip of the iceberg. Lupita and Winston are a married couple with two children, Shahadi and Evan. The story takes place in the present and in flashbacks to 1986. The family decides to take a summer vacation at a beach house in Santa Cruz, California. Problems arise when doppelgangers show up. During the flashbacks, you learn that Lupita had a traumatic experience that comes back to haunt her in the present-hint, hint, it involves the doppelgangers, who are trying to kill them. Each of the four main actors also play their own doppelgangers, only more psychotically enhanced-they are really hard to kill, too. The details of where they came from, what they want, why they are doing what they are doing, etc. are all explained briefly, but not in enough details for my tastes-I wish they would have gone into more background. The way the doppelgangers move, talk and act are all really creepy.
It's rated 'R' for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-ray.",8,2,7,23 March 2019
Knives Out," In The Vein Of Murder On The Orient Express
","I saw 'Knives Out', starring Daniel Craig-the James Bond movies, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo_2011; Chris Evans-the Captain America & Avengers movies, the Fantastic Four movies; Jamie Lee Curtis-the Halloween movies, Christmas With the Kranks; Don Johnson-Django Unchained, Machete; Christopher Plummer-The Man Who Invented Christmas, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_2011 and Ana de Armas-Blade Runner 2049, War Dogs.
This is a murder mystery in the vein of Murder on the Orient Express-it has a lot of celebrities in it. Christopher plays the eccentric millionaire-among other things, he has a chair with knives all over it, looking like it was from Game of Thrones-and he is celebrating his 85th birthday with the whole family coming in for it. Jamie is his daughter, Don is her husband and Chris is their son. There are other family members-and they are all dysfunctional-and Ana is the care giver to Christopher. Ana seems to be the only one that really likes Christopher. During the night, Christopher is found dead-his throat slit with a knife-and it is ruled a suicide. After the funeral, the police show up at the family home with Daniel-a private investigator-and start asking questions. It seems that it might not have been suicide but maybe murder, instead. Everyone is a suspect with a motive.
It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, language, drug material and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,4,15,28 November 2019
Point Break," The Original is Better
","I saw 'Point Break', starring Edgar Ramirez-Zero Dark Thirty, The Bourne Ultimatum; Luke Bracey-The November Man, G.I.Joe:Retaliation, Teresa Palmer-Warm Bodies, The Grudge 2 and Delroy Lindo-Domino, The One.This is a remake of the classic 1991 Point Break, which starred Keanu Reeves & Patrick Swayze. FYI: Neither one of them make a cameo in this one and it would have been extremely hard for Swayze to appear, since he has passed away. Edgar has the Swayze role of Bodhi and Luke has the Reeves role of Utah. For anyone unfamiliar with the original-Shame on you-Edgar is the leader of a group of extreme sports fanatics that have been robbing some financial market corporations and giving the loot back to the poor. They claim to be following in the footsteps of their extreme sports idol Ozaki. Ozaki had an extreme competition called the Ozaki 8, which was a list of challenges that would balance nature-don't ask me how-but even Ozaki never finished all 8 challenges-he died around number 4. Luke is a former extreme sports star-he excelled in motorcross and snowboarding-that has joined the F.B.I. and wants to earn his badge in the field. Luckily for him, a case has come up where his qualifications will come in handy, and his boss, Delroy in the Gary Busey role, puts him on the case. Luke infiltrates Edgar's gang and meets Teresa, in the Lori Petty role, and the romantic sparks start flying. The story is pretty close to the original, with extreme sports being more prominent here-sometimes, it's almost like watching a commercial for an extreme sports channel, what with all the snowboarding, wingsuit flying, free rock climbing, motorcross and surfing going on. It's not a bad movie, I just liked the original better-maybe because of Keanu, Patrick and Gary. But if you are into extreme sports, you may like it better than I did. It's rated 'PG-13' for perilous activity, violence, drug use, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",6,7,14,25 December 2015
Creed," The Start of a New Franchise?
","I saw 'Creed', starring Michael B. Jordan-Fantastic Four_2015, Fruitvale Station; Sylvester Stallone-The Expendables movies, the Rocky movies; Tessa Thompson-For Colored Girls, When a Stranger Calls_2006; Phylicia Rashad-For Colored Girls, The Cosby Show_tv and Tony Bellew-This is his first movie, he is a real boxer from Liverpool, England.This is a 'Rocky' movie but Rocky doesn't do any boxing in it. Maybe it's the start of a new franchise or something, since Sylvester is getting a little older. Michael plays the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. It seems that Apollo had an affair outside of his marriage-Wow, who ever heard of a sports figure doing such a thing? Anyway, Phylicia plays Apollo's widow-in case you may have forgotten, Apollo was killed by a big Soviet fighter, aka, Dolph Lundgren-and she adopts Michael from an orphanage, where he is always getting into fights. I guess fighting is just in his blood. Since Michael was born after Apollo died, he never knew his father. He decides to try to make a living as a boxer and decides to look up Sylvester, since he is the closest person he can think of that knew Apollo, and see if he can train him. Sylvester is running a restaurant called Adrian's-I bet he loves answering the phone with, 'Adriannnn's!'-and is reluctant to train Michael at first but soon gives in. He even tells Michael about the 3rd fight between Rocky and Apollo at the end of Rocky 3, and who won it. Tessa plays a neighbor of Michael's that is trying to become a singer. Oh yeah, she is his love interest, too. Tony plays an English boxer-I know, a big stretch for him to do-who also happens to be the big opponent for Michael. The fights are good, just as exciting as in the earlier Rocky movies. Michael even gets to wear the red, white and blue American trunks in his big fight. It's rated 'PG' for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. If you are a fan of the Rocky movies, you will probably enjoy this one, too. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,0,6,26 November 2015
About Time," Time Travel Love Story
","I saw 'About Time', starring Domhnall Gleeson-Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 2, True Grit-2010; Rachel McAdams-The Vow, Wedding Crashers; Bill Nighy-Jack the Giant Slayer, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows:Part 1 and Lindsay Duncan-Under the Tuscan Sun, Star Wars:Episode 1-The Phantom Menace. This is a weird time travel/love story. I'm not exactly sure who the target audience is. Domhnall plays a young English lad that finds out-on his 21st birthday-that he can travel into the past and change events. There are a few rules-of course, even in a time travel/love story, you have to have rules. For instance, he can only travel to destinations during his own lifetime-he could not go back and kill Hitler because that was before he was born-and he can not tell anyone about this ability-except for his own son on his 21st birthday. Bill plays his father, that gives him this startling news and Lindsay plays his clueless mother. Rachel plays the American girl that Domhnall uses his new powers to ensnare as a girlfriend and then later, as his wife. There is also a side story about the relationship between Domhnall and Bill. It was rated 'R' for language and sexual content-I remember partial nudity only, nothing full frontal-and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-It was a pretty typical love story, with the only new twist being the time travel ability-but it would be alright, as a rental. My wife did say that she thought it was a little too long.",6,1,6,9 November 2013
Spotlight," Unsettling But Captivating
","I saw 'Spotlight', starring Michael Keaton-Need For Speed, The Other Guys; Mark Ruffalo-The Hulk in the Avengers movies, 13 Going on 30 and Liev Schreiber-Salt, Sabretooth in the X-Men movies. This is based on a true story about the Catholic priests that were caught molesting kids. The title of the movie Spotlight refers to the name of the investigative team of reporters that worked for the Boston Globe. Michael is the team leader, with Mark and Rachel as a couple of his teammates. Liev is the new Editor in charge that gets the investigation going. Previously, no one had any luck in proving anything against the pedophileing priests because the Catholic church was so powerful. They had teams of lawyers and they had relocated the bad boy priests to different branches of the church after they would get caught and then continue business as if nothing ever happened. The Spotlight team uncovers more than even they were expecting; over 90 of the offending clergymen. And that is just in the Boston area! The actors are all good in their roles and the story is captivating, although a little unsettling because of the subject matter. It's rated 'R' for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes. It would be a good rental-not one I would buy, once was enough.",7,2,5,11 December 2015
Aquaman," Action Packed Extravaganza
","I saw 'Aquaman', starring Jason Momoa-Game of Thrones_tv, Stargate:Atlantis_tv; Amber Heard_Magic Mike XXL: Machete Kills; Patrick Wilson-The Nun, The Watchmen and Nicole Kidman-Paddington, Batman Forever.
This movie is based on a comic book character that was created in 1941. Thank goodness their inspiration is based specifically on a more updated story line from 2011, and not the 40's, 50's and 60's incarnation. Aquaman was not a real popular hero back in those days. In fact, lots of people would often make fun of his powers-he talked to fish. Although their are several nods to those more silly years-remember Topo the octopus? Well, he makes a cameo. The movie is directed by James Wan, who is more known for his horror films-such as the Conjuring , Insidious & Saw. Jason plays Arthur Curry-aka Aquaman-the half breed created by a human father and an Atlantean mother, who learns he is an heir to the throne of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. However, he has no interest in the title and just wants to stay on the surface world. Nicole plays his mother. Jason's half brother Patrick, believes that he should rule-since he is a full blooded Atlantean. For the comic book crowd, Patrick's name is Orm, aka the Ocean Master. Amber-aka Mera-shows up to the surface world to try and change Jason's mind and come rule as the king. Otherwise, Patrick will declare war on the surface dwellers. Battles insue and it's an action packed CGI extravaganza, especially after another villain named Black Manta shows up. There are a few cameo actors that pop up-I liked the Dolph Lundgren one-and there is a scene just as the end credits start that hints at the next movie, but nothing at the very end.
It's rated 'PG-13' for sci_fi violence, action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes.
I must admit, Aquaman is not one of my favorite heroes but I like Jason and I really enjoyed this movie. I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,2,22 December 2018
Concussion," Interesting Story
","I saw 'Concussion', starring Will Smith-Focus, The Anchorman movies; Gugu Mbatha-Rwa-Jupiter Ascending, Larry Crowne; Alec Baldwin- Mission:Impossible-Rogue Nation, Rock of Ages and Albert Brooks-This is 40, The In-Laws.This is based on a true story about the immigrant doctor, Bennet Omalu, that found a connection between severe head trauma in football injuries and the degenerative brain disease CTE-Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Will plays the doctor that made the NFL mad-it would damage their precious money making sport of football, if his allegations were true, and they were. Will plays the Nigerian pathologist that was working as a coroner in Pittsburgh when he first found the evidence. He even thought that the NFL would be happy that he brought it to their attention-Boy, was he naive! Of course, the NFL denied any connection between the deaths and the new found disease and even brought out their own evidence saying the opposite of Will's-sort of like the tobacco industry did with the 'Smoking is not bad for you' campaigns. Football players start turning up on Will's table and they all show signs of aggression, suicidal tendencies and early dementia which led to their deaths. Oh yeah, they are only in their 40's & 50's when this happens. Will goes to his boss, Albert, and tells him that the repeated blows to the head are not good for the players-Duh! Gugu plays Will's love interest and Alec plays the Pittsburgh team doctor. As the end credits start, they tell you what the good doctor is doing now and what happened with the NFL and what they have done about the problem. It's rated 'PG-13' for disturbing images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental.",6,1,5,9 January 2016
Don Jon," Funny Adult Comedy
","I saw 'Don Jon', starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt-The Dark Knight Rises, Angels in the Outfield; Scarlett Johansson-The Avengers-2012, Eight Legged Freaks; Tony Danza-Angels in the Outfield, Going Ape! and Julianne Moore-30 Rock-t.v., The Big Lebowski.This is a comedy that is written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and he also stars in it, too. Although it is funny, the subject matter might be a little touchy to some people-I know my wife would not like it. Joseph has the nickname of Don Jon because of his womanizing skills; he and his buddies rate women on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, and Joseph never goes home with less than an 8. But, Joseph also likes to look at porn. And when he looks at porn, he likes to.... pleasure himself. Even with all these one night stands, he still masturbates-that's the touchy subject that I mentioned earlier. When Scarlett shows up on the club scene, Joseph thinks that he has found the one girl that he can be faithful to, and decides to make a commitment. Unfortunately, he gets caught visiting porn sites and the troubles begin. Tony plays Joseph's father and Julianne is a fellow student that Joseph meets. I thought it was pretty good for Joseph's directorial & writing debut. It's rated 'R' for sexual content-including nudity-language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I thought it was pretty funny and I would buy it on DVD.",7,4,9,27 September 2013
Deadpool 2," Great Action & Laughs, But NOT For The Kids
","I saw 'Deadpool 2', starring Ryan Reynolds-The Hitman's Bodyguard, The Amityville Horror_2005; Josh Brolin-Avengers:Infinity War, Men in Black 3; Morena Baccarin-Gotham_tv, Still Life_tv and Julian Dennison-Hunt For the Wilderpeople, Shopping.
This is the sequel to the 2016 Deadpool and they have already green lit a 3rd sequel. Ryan returns as Deadpool, 'The Merc with a Mouth'. And before I go any further, let me stress, this is not a kiddie super hero movie. Lots of language, violence, gore, body parts being dismembered, nudity, etc. This is an 'R' rated movie-so don't take the little tykes to see it, because I saw parents with little ones in the theater I was in and it wasn't a pretty sight. Anyway, back to the movie. Josh plays Cable-comic fans know who his father is-a man from the future on a mission to kill Julian, a young mutant that will become a villain where Josh is from. Ryan befriends Julian in prison and tries to save him from the time-traveling Josh's wraith. Morena also returns as Ryan's beautiful girlfriend. The humor is great-lots of references to current events-and there are lots of cameos, including other heroes and actors in small parts-I remember seeing Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, one as a hero and one as a redneck. One person I did not see was Stan Lee! No cameo for him-maybe because of the R rating? But no, he was in the first Deadpool, so, what the heck? Oh well. There is a great scene, just as the end credits begin, involving time travel but there is nothing at the very end.
It's rated 'R' for violence, gore, language, drug use, drinking and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",9,3,6,19 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Best of the Thor Movies
","I saw 'Thor:Ragnarok', starring Chris Hemsworth-Ghostbusters_2016, Vacation_2015; Tom Hiddleston-Kong:Skull Island, I Saw the Light; Cate Blanchett-Cinderella_2015, the Lord of the Rings movies; Jeff Goldblum-The Independence Day movies, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Mark Ruffalo-The Now You See Me movies, Windtalkers. This is the third Thor solo movie-not counting the Avengers & Doctor Strange movies-and I think it's the best one of them all. In Norse mythology, Ragnarok means 'Twilight of the Gods', or basically, the end of everything. It really has some surprising instances where I found myself saying, 'They didn't really just do that, did they?' I won't spoil them all here but people die-and I'm talking main characters-and things are destroyed. Chris/Thor is neck deep in trouble when his older sister, Cate/Hela, shows up wanting to take over Asgard. FYI: Cate is the first female villain in the Marvel movie universe. Tom/Loki is thrown into the mix and you wonder just whose side he is on-remember, he is the god of lies. While fighting Cate, Chris gets sent to a planet run by Jeff/Grandmaster. Jeff has gladiatorial games as his source of entertainment and his current champion is Mark/Hulk. Guess who he gets to fight next? Stan Lee makes his usual cameo-look for the guy giving Chris a haircut-and there are a couple of other cameos, both of the super hero and actor variety. Let me tell you, Jimmy Kimmel would positively hate one of them. There is a lot more humor here, too. There is no Jane Foster & company. I want to mention a pet peeve of mine; Lots of times a song will be used in the trailer but not appear in the movie. I'm talking about Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song' here. That is not the case. It was used several times during Chris's fights. There are two scenes after the credits start. One just as they start and one at the very end. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi violence & action and some brief nudity- don't get too excited, it's of the Hulk's backside-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,11,3 November 2017
Ready Player One," Stunning Visuals
","I saw 'Ready Player One', starring Tye Sheridan-Cyclops in X-Men:Apocalypse, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse; Olivia Cooke-Bates Motel_tv, Ouija; Mark Rylance-Dunkirk, Bridge of Spies and Ben Mendelsohn-Darkest Hour, The Dark Knight Rises.
This movie is based on a book by Ernest Cline and is directed by Steven Spielberg. It takes place in the not too distant future, around 2045, when most people spend most of their time playing a virtual reality game called Oasis. It was created by Mark and you can do anything or be anyone in the game-it's only limited by your imagination. As you can guess, Mark is rather wealthy and he leaves a video will-knowing he is going to die-saying that he has left 3 keys hidden in the Oasis, and whoever can find all three will win his entire fortune and total control of the Oasis. Tye and Olivia are the top scorers-both are big fans of the 1980's, as was Mark-and their biggest competition is a corporation run by Ben. Ben is the typical corporate greedy type that will do whatever it takes to make money. The visuals are stunning and their are lots of Easter eggs scattered throughout the movie. It's fun just waiting to see who you can spot next, from the Iron Giant to King Kong to ....well, I don't want to spoil any of the ones that are not shown in the trailers. The music is good too, if you like that 1980's period. I remember hearing Rush, Van Halen and the Bee Gees just to name a few. Overall, I really enjoyed it-FYI: For a movie with lots of Easter eggs, I figured there might be an extra scene after the end credits, but alas, there wasn't.
It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi action, violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 20 minutes.
I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,5,31 March 2018
The Hateful Eight," Best Tarantino Film Yet
","I saw 'The Hateful Eight', starring Samuel L. Jackson-Nick Fury in the Avengers movies, Snakes on a Plane; Kurt Russell-Furious 7, Vanilla Sky; Jennifer Jason Leigh-Road to Perdition, Fast Times at Ridgemont High; Walter Goggins-Justified_tv, The Bourne Identity; Demian Bichir-Machete Kills, The Heat; Tim Roth-Selma, The Incredible Hulk; Michael Madsen-Sin City, Die Another Day and Bruce Dern-D'Jango Unchained, The Cowboys.This is Quentin Tarantino's eighth movie-notice the number 8 in the title? It is a western and he has Ennio Morricone doing the music-he did the music for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It is shot in 70mm, which hasn't been done since the 1960's. In fact, this is the same camera that was used during the filming of Ben Hur; not one like it but the actual camera. For the first week or two of the film's release, Quentin is doing what he calls a 'Roadshow' engagement, which means you have an overture before the movie-just music-and an intermission in the middle, so you can stretch your legs or go to the restroom. The whole movie has a nice, old fashioned feel to it. Kurt plays a bounty hunter right after the Civil War that is bringing Jennifer in for a reward-plus a hanging- on a stage coach that is trying to beat a snow blizzard headed their way. He crosses paths with Samuel and Walter and gives them a ride. Why not, they are heading the same way and there is a blizzard coming their way. They stop at a rest stop because of the blizzard catching up to them and find four strangers already occupying the building; Demian, Tim, Michael and Bruce. All of them have different occupations-a sheriff, a hangman, retired military general, a cowboy and another bounty hunter and Kurt has to decide who is telling the truth and who is lying through their crooked teeth. He believes that one or more of the strangers have ulterior motives and are either in cahoots with Jennifer and want to set her free or want the reward money for themselves. If you like Quentin's movies, you should enjoy this one because I think it's his best one he has made yet. It's rated 'R' for bloody violence, language and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 48 minutes-not counting the overture and intermission. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,5,24,27 December 2015
BlacKkKlansman," Thought Provoking
","I saw 'BlacKkKlansman', starring John David Washington-Ballers_tv, Malcolm X, Oh yeah, he is the son of Denzel; Adam Driver-Kylo Ren in the Star Wars movies, This Is Where I Leave You; Laura Harrier-Spider_Man:Homecoming, One Life To Live_tv and Topher Grace-Predators, Spider_Man 3.
This movie is based on a true story about an African-American cop that infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970's. It is based on the book that was written by the police officer doing the infiltrating, Ron Stallworth and directed by Spike Lee. John plays Ron, the first black cop in Colorado Springs, Colorado. At first, he is given office file duty and gets really bored really quick. Then, he gets the idea to try and infiltrate the KKK after he calls them-and using his best white voice-talks to the head honcho himself, David Duke, played by Topher. He keeps up the masquerade over the phone but he needs a white cop to meet the klan members in person, so that's where Adam comes in. Laura is working for a college group of young protesters that John infiltrates-he also falls for her. The movie covers racism, anger & hate during the period so there is some strong, racially charged language. You can see parallels between the way people acted then and the way people do today-there are some subtle Trump jabs. There are also a couple of cameos. Harry Belafonte tells a story of racism and torture during one part of the movie. As the end credits start, you can hear 'Mary Don't You Weep' by Prince, a previously unreleased live recording and they also show some actual riot footage taken at Charlottesville about a year ago, plus a tribute to the murder of Heather Heyer.
It's rated 'R' for language-including racial epithets-disturbing and violent material and sexual references and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.
It is a thought provoking film and I would probably buy it on DVD.",7,6,17,12 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Back To The Basics
","I saw 'Spider-Man:Homecoming', starring Tom Holland-The Lost City of Z, In the Heart of the Sea; Michael Keaton-The Founder, White Noise; Marisa Tomei-Trainwreck, Wild Hogs and Robert Downey Jr.-The Sherlock Holmes movies, Gothika.This is the latest reboot of the Spider-Man franchise and thankfully, there is no origin story! I think by now, everyone should have an idea about what happened, if they have seen any of the other Spider-Man movies or read any of the books. This one has Tom/Peter Parker/Spider- Man as a 15 year old High School student facing the world with the fact that he has incredible powers, but he is still just a teenager. FYI: Tom was actually 19 years old when he began filming so he is pretty close to the age he is supposed to be playing here. It also takes place right after his debut in Captain America:Civil War. Robert/Iron Man is now mentoring Tom, until he is battle ready to become a full fledged Avenger-He even gives Tom a new fancy Spider suit with all kinds of built-in gadgets. Tom's excuse to Marisa/Aunt May is that he is an intern to Tony Stark. Michael/Adrian Toomes/Vulture plays a clean-up crew leader that takes care of cleaning up after the super fights the heroes always seem to be getting into. He stumbles across some alien technology and then decides to incorporate it into some new fancy energy weapons. FYI: You get to see early versions of other villains as henchmen working for Michael. And I must say, Michael makes a great villain. He gives him depth and he is not just a bad person doing bad things. Some funny scenes have Captain America doing PSAs-Public Sevice Announcements-for the High School. You will hear the classic Spider-Man theme-'Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can'-at the beginning, Stan Lee makes his cameo and there are 2 end scenes. One as the end credits start and another at the very end so don't leave early. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi action violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. I really enjoyed this reboot that went back to the basics and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,4,9,7 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Summer Popcorn Movie
","I saw 'Fast & Furious 6', starring Vin Diesel-XXX , Pitch Black, Dwayne Johnson-Pain & Gain, Tooth Fairy, Michelle Rodriguez-Machete, Resident Evil, Luke Evans-Immortals, Clash of the Titans-2010 and Gina Carano-Haywire, Blood and Bone.Sometimes sequels will run out of steam as they go along and sometimes they continue to be watchable. This one is more than just watchable, it's still a summer popcorn movie. It is action packed with over the top stunts-jumping from moving cars to other moving cars, for example, not too believable, but fun to watch- but it also concentrates on the characters. Luke plays the bad guy here, a terrorist that is tearing up different countries in his pursuit of a weapon that will make him rich. Dwayne is the super-cop on his tail, but he is always one step behind him. Dwayne decides to enlist Vin and his team to help catch Luke. Oh yeah, Michelle-who supposedly died in an earlier movie-returns and she is working for Luke-it is explained how she pulled that off in flashbacks. Gina plays Dwayne's new partner and if you have ever seen Gina in action-see Haywire-then you know she can fight. Gina and Michelle have a couple of good dust-ups. There is a scene right after the credits start that perfectly sets up the next movie, introducing a major actor as a bad guy-I am a big fan of his. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, language and sexuality-no nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,4,24 May 2013
Begin Again," Good Music & Story
","I saw 'Begin Again', starring Mark Ruffalo-Bruce Banner in the Avengers movies, 13 Going on 30; Keira Knightley-Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Domino; Adam Levine-the Maroon 5 singer that you might have also seen in American Horror Story_t.v., 30 Rock_t.v. and Hailee Steinfeld-Ender's Game, True Grit_2010.This is a story about a journey on the road to fame and success in the music business. Mark plays a burned-out record producer that has come on hard times. He used to be pretty good at his job but after some personal family problems, he started to drink a lot, and eventually lost his job. Hailee is his teen-aged daughter that is acting out in rebellion because she needs a father for guidance. Keira and Adam are a couple that have been dating since college and both have dreams of becoming famous in the music business-they are both singer/song writers. Adam gets his shot before Keira and takes off for fame and riches without her. Mark hears Keira in a small bar singing and spots the potential for great success, so he offers to produce her music for an album but she is not sure if she should trust him; he looks like a drunk, homeless man. The story line is not too original-I'm sure I've heard versions of it before-but the story is not too predictable and I enjoyed the music. Keira learned to play guitar for the role and I think I heard her say in an interview that she did her own singing-which, if it's true, is not too shabby. It's rated 'R' for the language and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",7,2,6,14 July 2014
Black Mass," Johnny Should Get An Oscar!
","I saw 'Black Mass', starring Johnny Depp-Mortdecai, The Lone Ranger_2013; Joel Edgerton-The Gift, Star Wars:Episode 3_Revenge of the Sith; Dakota Johnson-Fifty Shades of Grey, Need For Speed; Benedict Cumberbatch-The Imitation Game, 12 Years a Slave, Oh yeah, he is playing Doctor Strange in 2016 and Kevin Bacon-The Following_tv, X-Men:First Class.This movie is based on the true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger, who was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for 12 years. Johnny plays James and he does a really good job of it. His make-up, hair and eye contact lenses completely change his looks so much so, that he is fairly unrecognizable. Johnny and Benedict play brothers and Joel is a childhood friend that grew up with both of them in Boston, but they all took different career paths; Johnny as the head of the Irish mob, Benedict as a US senator and Joel as an FBI agent. Kevin plays Joel's boss at the FBI headquarters that wants Joel to crack down on Johnny and Dakota plays Johnny's wife. Johnny starts out as a low level Irish criminal in the 1970's & 80's with the Italian Mafia edging in on his territory. Johnny becomes an informer to the FBI so that they will take out his competition, the Mafia, and gets immunity for his earlier criminal life, in exchange for it. The only problem was that Johnny continued with his criminal life. The FBI did not like being played as fools, so that is when Johnny had to go on the run and became the FBI's most wanted man-his $2 million dollar reward was the highest amount ever offered for a felon, except for Osama bin Laden. The movie is very violent with Johnny changing at the drop of a hat, between being nice and psychotic. As the end credits start, you see pictures and video of the real Bulger and his compatriots and they tell you where they are now and what happened to them or how many years sentences they received. It's rated 'R' for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I would not be surprised if Johnny gets an Oscar for this role. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",7,4,12,18 September 2015
Suicide Squad," Super Hero Version of The Dirty Dozen
","I saw 'Suicide Squad', starring Will Smith-Focus, the Bad Boys movies, and #3 is coming in 2017 & #4 in 2019; Margot Robbie-The Legend of Tarzan, Focus; Viola Davis-How to Get Away With Murder_tv, Madea Goes to Jail; Cara Delevingne-Paper Towns, Anna Karenina and Jared Leto-Dallas Buyers Club, Fight Club.This is based on a comic book but one that is not as well known as say, Batman or Superman. At least it used to be but it has gotten popular again in the last few years due to Harley Quinn-in fact, the comics just came out this week with a brand new first issue in a new series. For those unfamiliar with the books, a secret government agency uses incarcerated super villains on black ops missions in exchange for reduced time on their prison sentences. Think of it as a super hero version of the Dirty Dozen. Viola plays the government boss known as Amanda Waller. The Suicide Squad is also known as Task Force X. Super humans are called meta-humans and the basic idea is to use meta-humans to fight other meta-humans. Will plays Deadshot, an assassin who never misses a shot, hence his name. Margot plays Harley Quinn, former psychiatrist to inmates that became the Joker's girlfriend. Cara plays the Enchantress, a magical witch and Jared is the Joker. Cara & Jared are not really members of the team; Cara is a failed recruit that goes bad and becomes the main bad guy the Squad has to try to stop and Jared spends most of his time trying to rescue Margot from the clutches of the trying-to-be-good team. You may wonder how Viola can keep the villains in check, why don't they just make a break for it on a mission. Well, Viola has planted tiny-but powerful-explosives in their brains, and yes, one of the team members finds out that she is not bluffing when his brains are scattered all over the pavement. There are two DC heroes that have cameos; one that you probably saw in the trailers and the other is a future JLA member that was glimpsed in the earlier Batman vs Superman movie. They used some classic rock songs in the soundtrack. I remember hearing songs by Norman Greenbaum, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Queen and Black Sabbath. As the end credits start, there is a scene that is a direct set up for the future JLA movie but nothing is at the very end. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, action, disturbing behavior and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,2,5 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Great Story with Mind-numbing Super Heroics
","I saw 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier', starring Chris Evans-The Avengers_2012, Cellular; Scarlett Johansson-The Avengers_2012, Home Alone 3; Anthony Mackie-Pain & Gain, The Hurt Locker, Sebastian Stan- Captain America: The First Avenger, The Covenant and Robert Redford- Lions For Lambs, The Horse Whisperer. This is the second Captain America movie-with a third in the planning- but it more closely follows the Avengers movie-with a second & a third in the planning. This is a great sequel because most of the back story has already been established and they can just get down to it. This one also has a good story, as well as the mind-numbing super heroics going for it. Chris returns as Captain America, a time misplaced soldier trying to understand the world he is now living in. He has problems with deciding on who to trust after disagreeing with the way things are done. Scarlett returns as the Black Widow, a former Soviet spy that is now a top field agent for S.H.I.E.L.D., the international peace-keeping organization. Anthony joins the cast as Sam Wilson, aka the Falcon, Chris' new side-kick. Sebastian plays the Winter Soldier-if you are familiar with the comics, you know who he is-and Robert plays a bureaucrat that runs the World Security Council, who gives S.H.I.E.L.D. their orders. FYI: If you are a MMA fan, Georges St-Pierre has a good cameo as Batroc the Leaper. Stan Lee also has his usual cameo. There are two scenes at the end; one as the end credits start and one after they are over, so do not leave early. It's rated 'PG-13' for the violence and gun play and has a running time of 2 hours & 16 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",9,3,6,4 April 2014
Doctor Strange," Pure Marvel Magic
","I saw 'Doctor Strange', starring Benedict Cumberbatch-Black Mass, 12 Years a Slave; Chiwetel Ejiofor-The Martian, 12 Years a Slave; Rachel McAdams-Aloha, the Sherlock Holmes movies; Mads Mikkelsen-Hannibal_tv, Casino Royale_2006 and Tilda Swinton-Trainwreck, Constantine.This is based on a comic book hero created by Stan Lee & Steve Ditko in 1963, and yes, Stan has his usual cameo appearance-look for him on a bus that Benedict slams into. Doctor Strange is a lesser known character-to most non-comic readers-that uses magic, or the mystic arts, instead of the usual super powers. Where as the Avengers handle the super powered villains, Stephen Strange fights supernatural enemies from other dimensions. In fact, his powers are explained as being energy that is drawn from other dimensional planes of existence. Of course, the origin story has to be told, but it isn't one most people know, so it isn't boring. Basically, Benedict plays a gifted, egotistical surgeon that gets in a car accident that damages his hands-what he makes his living with-and tries all kinds of traditional medical remedies, that just don't work. He then hears about a crippled man that was mysteriously healed and goes in search of his nontraditional cure. This leads him to Chiwetel/Mordo, a student of Tilda/the Ancient One-in the comics, the Ancient One is an old man but it was changed here to be a woman. Tilda and Chiwetel teach Benedict in the mystic arts and how to focus the energy into shields and weapons because another student, Mads, that dropped out of Tilda's class, has gone to the dark side and teamed up with Dormammu and is on the verge of destroying the world-they need Benedict's help to stop them. Rachel is a fellow doctor that Benedict works with and she gets involved in things, like patching up Benedict after a battle. And as far as the battles go, there are mystic battles-with fantastic looking special effects that look like the movie Inception on steroids-and there are also some good martial arts fights as well as plenty of humor thrown in for good measure. Oh yeah, at the beginning, look for a new Marvel opening logo and as the end credits start, there is a scene with an Avenger and at the very end, after the credits, is another scene with Chiwetel. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. This is a movie that was made to be seen in 3D, which I did, and I would definitely buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,4,8,4 November 2016
Interstellar," Good Story But Not Great
","I saw 'Interstellar', starring Matthew McConaughey-Dallas Buyers Club, Amistad; Mackenzie Foy-The Conjuring, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Parts 1&2; Michael Caine-The Dark Knight movies, Jaws: The Revenge; Anne Hathaway-The Dark Knight Rises, Brokeback Mountain and Jessica Chastain- Zero Dark Thirty, The Help.This is a sci-fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan-The Dark Knight movies & Inception-about the not too distant future on Earth, where drought and famine has just about wiped out mankind-I bet you thought it would have been aliens that destroyed us. Matthew is a farmer now but he used to be an astronaut/pilot, before everything went bad. Mackenzie plays his 10 year old daughter. Michael plays a NASA scientist that has been working on a solution to save humanity but he needs Matthew's help. Michael wants to send a spaceship into a blackhole near Saturn that could possible discover a suitable, livable replacement planet for everyone to relocate to. He even volunteers his own daughter, Anne, to go along on the trip-she is a scientist, but it doesn't hurt that she is easy on the eyes. The only problem is that traveling through blackholes is not an every day occurrence, so there is a lot of speculation about how time could be a factor; one day on the other side of the blackhole could be seven years back on Earth and everyone could be dead by the time they completed their mission, if they are not careful. Jessica plays the older version of Mackenzie and she was not happy with her father leaving her, even if it was to try and save the whole world. The special effects are pretty good and FYI, Christopher said that he did not use any green screens for his effects. There are some cool looking robots-I have never seen one like it-and there are several cameo actors that might surprise you. It's rated 'PG-13' for intense action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough. It would have been better if it had been a little shorter-almost 3 hours-but it would be a good rental.",7,4,10,7 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Dramatic Comedy
","I saw 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri', starring Frances McDormand-Moonrise Kingdom, Aeon Flux; Woody Harrelson-War For the Planet of the Apes, Seven Psychopaths; Sam Rockwell-Poltergeist_2015, Seven Psychopaths and Abbie Cornish-Geostorm, Seven Psychopaths. This is a comical drama-or, dramatic comedy-that has good actors and a good story but a bad ending that leaves you hanging. Frances plays a woman that had a daughter that was found raped and murdered and then set on fire. She doesn't think the police chief, Woody, has done his job in finding the killer responsible. Frances decides to put a message on three billboards stating her feelings. Nothing slanderous or untrue. She just poses the question of why Woody has not caught the killer, yet. Abbie plays Woody's wife and Sam is a racist deputy that lives at home with his mother. Almost all of the characters are complex, and will throw you a curve-no one is all good or all bad. Even Frances does things that are questionable and lies about things. If the ending were better, I would have given it a higher rating. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. I wouldn't buy it on DVD-unless the DVD has an alternate ending-but it would be a good rental.",7,3,5,2 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Wraps Up Things Nicely
","I saw 'Star Wars:The Rise of Skywalker', starring Daisy Ridley-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, Scrawl; Adam Driver-The Dead Don't Die, Logan Lucky; Keri Russell-The Americans_tv, Mission:Impossible 3 and Ian McDiarmid-The Lost City of Z, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.
This is the 9th and final chapter in the Skywalker saga-don't worry, there will be more Star Wars movies, just not about the Skywalkers. Daisy returns as Rey, the Jedi uncertain of her past or future and her family tree is finally revealed-and it is not what you might think. Adam returns as Kylo Ren, always trying to turn Daisy to the dark side. Keri is a new character that helps Daisy and friends on their search for answers and Ian returns as Palpatine-didn't he die before? Well, everything is explained on that front. There are several older characters that pop up and one of them is Carrie Fisher-it's been widely known that she is in this film so I am not spoiling anything here. Since she died shortly after completion of the last movie, the footage of Carrie is not CGI, but unused footage from episodes 7 & 8-The Force Awakens & The Last Jedi, respectively. The music is still by John Williams, it's directed by J.J. Abrams and there are some major character deaths-not just Stormtroopers but big name characters. As far as the plot goes, Ian is trying to relaunch the First Order and become the Emperor of the Universe and Daisy and crew are trying to stop him. There isn't any scenes after the end credits. Although it does get a little slow and repetitive at times, it does wrap up things nicely.
It's rated 'PG-13' for sci_fi violence and action & has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,9,27,21 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Godzilla Meets The Transformers
","I saw 'Pacific Rim', starring Charlie Hunnam-Sons of Anarchy-t.v., The Ledge; Idris Elba-Thor, The Losers; Rinko Kikuchi-At River's Edge, Sideways; Charlie Day-It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia-t.v., Horrible Bosses and Ron Perlman-Sons of Anarchy-t.v., the Hellboy movies.This is a monsters versus giant robots movie that is directed by Guillermo del Toro-Pan's Labyrinth, the Hellboy movies. It reminded me of the old Japanese Godzilla movies that I used to watch, as a kid. Basically, it's a big budget 'B' movie-Godzilla meets the Transformers, only there is more than just one Godzilla. The story takes place in the not too distant future-about 10 years from now-where a dimensional rift to an alien world has opened up a portal in our Pacific Ocean. The aliens are dinosaur-looking creatures that come through the portal, only a few at a time-as the years go by, they come more frequently. The governments of the world pool their resources and come up with giant robots, as a line of defense. The robots use two bonded pilots that are usually brothers or father & son, because it's easier to handle the robots. Charlie H is a veteran pilot, Idris is the boss of the robot program and Rinko is a new rookie pilot that teams up with Charlie H after he looses his brother in an earlier battle. Charlie D is a genius scientist-you have to have at least one of those-and Ron is a black market dealer that deals in alien body parts-he scavenges the bodies after fights and sells them. About one minute into the end credits, there is a scene that you should see. The movie is also being shown in 3D and IMAX 3D-that's what I saw it in. It's rated 'PG-13' for the violence and brief language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. If you like giant monsters fighting giant robots, then you should like this one. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Null,1,7,12 July 2013
American Sniper," True Story of an American Hero
","I saw 'American Sniper', starring Bradley Cooper-The Hangover movies, Failure to Launch; Sienna Miller-G.I.Joe:The Rise of Cobra, Layer Cake; Luke Grimes-Taken 2, Brothers & Sisters_tv and Sam Jaeger-Eli Stone_tv, Behind Enemy Lines.This movie is based on a true story about a Navy SEAL sniper, credited with being the deadliest sniper in US history, with over 160 confirmed kills. It's directed by Clint Eastwood. Bradley plays Chris Kyle, a native Texan, that grew up wanting to be nothing more than just a cowboy. Around the age of 30, he decided to do something to fight terrorists and joined the Navy SEALs, where he became a sniper-growing up, he was a good shot, so that kind of influenced him just a little bit. Before his first tour of duty, he meets and marries Sienna. He has a son before his second tour of duty and a daughter before his third tour. Sam plays a SEAL Lt. and Luke is another soldier. One of Bradley's fellow teammates reads comic books-the Punisher in particular-and so they decide to use the skull symbol on their shirts and equipment. There is an Iraqi sniper that is sort of a counterpart to Bradley and he kills lots of US soldiers and even tries killing Bradley on several occasions. By his fourth tour of duty, Bradley was getting a little PTSD-post traumatic stress disorder-which was to be expected after all he had been through. After getting some help for himself, he decided to help other vets that suffered from PTSD by visiting and talking with them-sometimes even taking them out and shooting targets. It is not shown on camera, but as the end credits start, you discover how he died in 2013 and the actual funeral procession is shown in Arlington, Texas. It's rated 'R' for war violence-it is graphic-language and sexual references-no actual nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",7,35,72,13 January 2015
Southpaw," Boxing Movie With A Good Story
","I saw 'Southpaw', starring Jake Gyllenhaal-End of Watch, Brokeback Mountain; Rachel McAdams-About Time, the Sherlock Holmes movies; Forest Whitaker-Taken 3, Criminal Minds_tv and Curtis Jackson-Power_tv, Last Vegas, and Oh yeah, he goes by another name, too; 50 Cent.This is a boxing movie with a good story. It was originally supposed to star rapper Eminem but he backed out, saying that he wanted to concentrate more on his music. He does contribute some songs to the soundtrack. This is also the last movie that music composer James Horner scored before he died in a plane crash on June 22, 2015. It's directed by Antoine Fuqua, who also handled The Equalizer, Olympus Has Fallen and Training Day-FYI: Right now he is working on a remake of The Magnificent Seven. The title of the movie, Southpaw, refers to someone that is left-handed, in this case, a left- handed boxer. Jake plays the aforementioned lefty that is the light weight champion-his record is 43/0-and he has everything you could imagine. A beautiful wife, Rachel, daughter, big mansion, fine cars, etc. Then, a tragedy takes it all away from him and he ends up having to try to rebuild his shattered life. Curtis, his manager, even leaves him-why stay when he isn't making him any money. Jake ends up with Forest, a former boxer turned trainer that runs a gym. Jakes' boxing style used to be that he would take a lot of punishment-he got hit a lot-but then he would focus his anger and then win the match. This was not making Rachel a very happy camper, as can be expected, so Forest then has his job cut out for him; to make Jake a better boxer. It's rated 'R' for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. I thought it was a good boxing movie and I would buy it on DVD.",7,1,3,24 July 2015
Ant-Man," Great, Humorous Super Installment In The Marvel Franchise
","I saw 'Ant-Man', starring Paul Rudd-The Anchorman movies, Halloween:The Curse of Michael Myers; Michael Douglas-Last Vegas, Haywire; Evangeline Lilly-Lost_tv, Freddy vs. Jason; Corey Stoll-The Strain_tv, Salt and Michael Pena-Fury, Million Dollar Baby.This is the newest super hero movie in the Marvel line of movies-and it is connected to them-and like most movie adaptations, there are a few minor changes from the comics. In the comics, Ant-Man was an original Avenger; one of 4, including the Hulk, Iron Man and Thor. Captain America did not even show up until issue #4. Michael D plays Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man and is shown in 1987 as a younger looking man-I guess they used CGI because he looks good-that invents his Pym Particles, a serum that can shrink and enlarge things, and oh yeah, he can communicate with ants with his helmet. Corey is his associate that has other ideas for the Pym Particles-he wants to sell it to the military, to make invincible soldiers. Of course, Michael D refuses and goes into retirement, taking the formula with him. Flash forward to the present, Paul-Scott Lang-plays a man getting out of prison for committing burglary, who just wants to go straight and reconnect with his young daughter. Problem is that no one likes to hire an ex-con, so he can not get a good job to pay child support to see his daughter-his wife insists that he needs to pay her to see his daughter. Michael P is Paul's best buddy and helps him out with a place to stay. Over the years, Corey has been working on perfecting the Pym serum with bad results, and Evangeline-Michael D's daughter-has been keeping an eye on Corey and reporting back to her dad. When Corey starts getting close to getting it right, Michael decides to enlist Paul as the new Ant-Man and put a stop to it. There is a lot of humor through out the movie, mostly thanks to Paul. There is a super hero fight with Ant-Man and an Avenger before the climatic battle of Ant-Man against Corey in his villainous Yellowjacket persona, near the end. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo and there are two scenes at the end; the first one is just as the end credits start and the second one is at the very end, after the end credits and it has two Avengers and Bucky in it, leading up to the next Captain America movie. It's rated 'PG-13' for the violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,3,9,17 July 2015
American Hustle," Good Con Movie
","I saw 'American Hustle', starring Christian Bale-Batman in the Dark Knight movies, Newsies; Jennifer Lawrence-Katniss in the Hunger Games movies, Silver Linings Playbook; Bradley Cooper-Silver Linings Playbook, the Hangover Movies; Amy Adams-Lois Lane in Man of Steel, Enchanted and Jeremy Renner-Hawkeye in The Avengers-2012, 28 Weeks Later.This movie is based on a real situation that happened in the late 1970's. The movie starts with Christian fixing his hair. He is overweight-I heard that he gained 40 to 50 pounds for the role-and he is balding, with longer hair on the sides of his head, which is what he is combing over to cover the bald spot-he is even using glue to keep it in place. Believe me, it is not a flattering scene but it does let you know a little about his character. He is a con artist. Amy is his partner and she uses a fake British accent to fool their 'marks'. Bradley plays an FBI agent that busts them and then decides to use them to get bigger fish. Jennifer plays Christian's loopy wife; she tricked Christian into marrying her and adopting her son, but she never leaves the house. She doesn't seem too bright, either but Christian stays because he loves the boy. Jeremy plays the mayor of New Jersey, the bigger fish of the FBI's take-down operation. There is a lot of good 1970's music, but FYI, Led Zeppelin's 'Good Times Bad Times' is not in the movie-it is used in some of the trailers. There is also a good cameo for a mob boss that shows up. It's rated 'R' for language, violence and sexual content-no actual nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes. I would probably buy this on DVD.",7,2,8,20 December 2013
Nightcrawler," An Interesting Look at the News Business
","I saw 'Nightcrawler', starring Jake Gyllenhaal-End of Watch, Brokeback Mountain; Rene Russo-Frigga in the Thor movies, Lethal Weapon 3&4; Bill Paxton-Edge of Tomorrow, Haywire and Riz Ahmed-Closed Circuit, Day of the Falcon.When I first heard the name of this movie-before I saw the trailer-I thought it was about the X-man. It's not. This is an interesting look at the news business. FYI: The name nightcrawler refers to a person that spends his nights looking for things to film, such as crimes or murder, and sells the footage to a news station. Jake plays an out of work opportunist. He will steal things-it can be anything from copper wire to a bicycle-and then turn around and sell it. It's like he has no moral sense that what he is doing is wrong. He is without a real purpose in his life but he is a fast learner and a go-getter. One day, while driving home, he comes across a traffic accident and sees Bill filming the scene. Bill informs Jake that he can sell the footage to a TV station to make a living and Jake decides that he now has a new career. Jake starts researching everything he needs to know on his computer and then hires Riz as his assistant. They then spend their nights , driving around, looking for something to film. Rene plays the head of a news station that Jake sells his videos to. What Jake does to get news stories is what is interesting here because, as I mentioned earlier, Jake is not a good person and it makes you wonder how much of this movie could be true. It's rated 'R' for violence, graphic images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. It kept my interest enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",7,3,7,31 October 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," SNL Sketch That Lasted Too Long
","I saw 'Popstar:Never Stop Never Stopping', Andy Samberg-That's My Boy, Hot Rod; Jorma Taccone-Grown Ups 2, Hot Rod; Akiva Schaffer-Neighbors, Hot Rod; Sarah Silverman-A Million Ways to Die In the West, There's Something About Mary and Tim Meadows-The Goldbergs_tv, Grown Ups 2.This is a mockumentary about a fictional rap group called The Style Boyz. It is written, directed and stars a real group called The Lonely Island-which consists of Andy, Jorma and Akiva-with Jorma & Akiva directing and all 3 writing & starring in it. I guess it could be about a lot of artists in the business but they have said that it is loosely based on Justin Bieber. Andy, Jorma and Akiva grew up together as best buds in a boy band-The Style Boyz-and had minor success, before Andy decided to go the solo route. Sarah and Tim work for Andy in a manager type capacity but Andy doesn't seem to become as popular on his own, as he thought he would be. There are lots of cameos from the music and entertainment world; one of the funniest is Justin Timberlake as Andy's personal chef. Most of the real music cameos will praise Andy and mention how much their lives have been influenced by him. There are a few funny parts but overall, it was like a SNL sketch that went on for a little too long. There is a scene just as the end credits start but nothing at the very end. It's rated 'R' for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 26 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. I don't think I would rent it, either. If you really want to see it, I'd wait until it comes to cable if I were you.",5,20,46,4 June 2016
Oblivion," Thinking Man's Sci-Fi

Bohemian Rhapsody," Really Captures Freddie, Both In Looks & Mannerisms
","I saw 'Bohemian Rhapsody', starring Rami Malek-Mr. Robot_tv, the Night at the Museum movies; Lucy Boynton-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, Law & Order:UK_tv; Gwilym Lee-Jamestown_tv, Midsomer Murders_tv and Ben Hardy-Only the Brave, X-Men:Apocalypse.
This is the story of the rock group Queen-the title of the movie is from one of their most famous songs-and Brian May is a producer. The film covers how Freddie Mercury meets and joins the group and then leads up to their Live Aid concert in 1985-FYI: Freddie Mercury died of complications of AIDS in 1991. Rami plays Freddie and he really captures Freddie, both in looks and his mannerisms. I wasn't sure if Rami was actually doing the singing-it looked like he was-but I read that they used a mixture of 3 voices; Marc Martel, Freddie Mercury and Rami Malek. Lucy plays Rami's girlfriend, Gwilym plays Brian May and Ben portrays Roger Taylor. There is a nice cameo from Mike Myers-you probably will not catch it because of his make-up, but listen for his voice. The performances really look and sound good, so if you are a Queen fan, you should enjoy the movie.
It's rated 'PG-13' for suggestive material, drug content and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes.
I am a Queen fan-I was lucky enough to have seen them in concert, in fact I took my soon to be wife-so I might be biased, but I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,2,4 November 2018
Baby Driver," Perfect Blend Of Action & Music
","I saw 'Baby Driver', starring Ansel Elgort-The Divergent movies, The Fault in Our Stars; Kevin Spacey-House of Cards_tv, The Horrible Bosses movies; Jon Hamm-Keeping Up With the Joneses, Sucker Punch; Lily James- Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Cinderella_2015 and Jamie Foxx-The Horrible Bosses movies, Miami Vice_2006.This is a heist movie that has the perfect blend of action and music. It's directed by Edgar Wright, who also directed Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, just to name a few. Ansel plays a getaway driver with some serious skills-and I must mention that all the car chase sequences are real and do not contain any CGI or green screen effects. Ansel was in a car accident as a child and has Tinnitus-ringing in the ears-so he constantly plays music on his I-Pod. Kevin is a crime boss that uses Ansel's skills to pull off his highly successful heists. And Kevin never uses the same group of people on a job, except for Ansel. Jon and Jamie play some of the accomplices in the robberies. Lily is a waitress that Ansel falls for and he wants to get out of the business and run away with her but Kevin keeps him busy-Ansel owes Kevin money and is trying to pay it off. The music is not just background filler, either. It seems to fit perfectly with what is happening on screen. There was a lot of good music-I remember hearing The Beach Boys, Golden Earring, Focus, T. Rex, Simon & Garfunkel, Barry White, Sam & Dave and Queen. There is also a few cameos, including Flea and Paul Williams. It's rated 'R' for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,12,21,28 June 2017
Justice League," Getting Better
","I saw 'Justice League', starring Ben Affleck-Live By Night, He's Just Not That Into You; Gal Gadot-Keeping Up With the Joneses, Knight and Day; Ezra Miller-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Trainwreck; Jason Momoa-Bullet to the Head, Game of Thrones_tv; Ray Fisher-In his first movie, not counting his brief cameo in Batman v Superman and the voice of Ciaran Hinds-Game of Thrones_tv, The Woman in Black. This is the movie I've been waiting for. All the big guns from DC in one movie-well, most of the big guns, anyways-Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. After Batman v Superman-which I thought looked great but the story could have been better-I was a little worried how this one would turn out. It has the same director, Zack Snyder, but this one actually did turn out better, which might be because I read that Joss Whedon came in to finish the movie after Zack had a death in his family. This one starts right after Batman v Superman ended, with Henry/Superman being dead and criminals are having a field day running rampant through the streets. Ben/Batman is trying to keep things under control when he comes across a para-demon- a winged insect looking creature from Apokolipse, an evil planet under the control of Darkseid. Ben consults with Gal/Wonder Woman, who has knowledge of the para-demons and their current boss, Ciaran/Steppenwolf-a general that works for Darkseid. Ben tries to round up any and all metahumans he can find, which include Ezra/Flash, Jason/Aquaman and Ray/Cyborg. Mother Boxes play a big part in the plot-comic book fans know what I'm talking about. They are a sophisticated technology that looks like a square box, but they are very powerful and sometimes used to teleport between places a lot. Another thing I liked was that they used the song from the trailers- Come Together as covered by Gary Clarke Jr-in the end credits. There is a brief scene where a combatant-who wears a powerful piece of jewelry-is spotted in a battle and there are 2 scenes at the very end. One as the end credits start-a recreation of a famous story line from the comics-and one after the credits-a teaser with 2 villains giving plot points to the next movie. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi violence and action and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,4,17 November 2017
Man of Steel," Modernized Reboot
","I saw 'Man of Steel', starring Henry Cavill-The Cold Light of Day, Immortals, Amy Adams-Trouble With the Curve, Julie & Julia, Michael Shannon-The Iceman, Vanilla Sky, Russell Crowe-The Man With the Iron Fists, Gladiator and Kevin Costner-Open Range, Waterworld.This is a reboot of the Superman franchise-Man of Steel is Superman's nickname-just like 'The Dark Knight' is Batman's. This year is the 75th anniversary of the original Superman comic book-1938, and this movie is directed by Zack Snyder-Watchmen, 300. This is a more modernized retelling of the origin, with a few twists that may have some comic fans in a tizzy; mostly, his costume, which does not have the outer red trunks. Henry plays Kal-El, Russell plays Jor-El, son & father from Krypton. Kevin plays Jonathan Kent, the nurturing farmer that becomes Henry's father on Earth. Most of Henry's childhood storyline is told in flashback scenes. The villain is General Zod, played by Michael-And if you remember, he was the villain from Superman 2, and the story here reminds me of that film, where Superman fights several Kryptonian people with the same powers as himself. Amy plays Lois Lane. As I said earlier, some fan boys may be disappointed-there is a scene in particular where Henry does something that you have never seen Superman do in a movie or t.v. show-but I'm not too worried about sticking to the comics, as long as the story is good-and in the incident mentioned, there is a good reason for what Henry does. The fights are good with great effects and Henry really does the part justice-he looks the part. I saw it in IMAX 3D. It's rated 'PG-13' for the action violence and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Null,0,0,14 June 2013
The Revenant," Realistic Looking Tale of Revenge
","I saw 'The Revenant', starring Leonardo DiCaprio-Django Unchained, The Quick and the Dead; Tom Hardy-Mad Max:Fury Road, Bane in The Dark Knight Rises; Domhnall Gleeson-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, True Grit_2010 and Will Poulter-The Maze Runner, We're the Millers.This movie is based on true events about a frontiersman named Hugh Glass. The story was made into an earlier movie back in 1971 and it was called 'Man in the Wilderness', starring Richard Harris. The director of this movie is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who also directed 'Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance'. Revenant is a French word, meaning to revert to spirit or ghost. The story takes place in the 1820's, with Leo playing Hugh Glass, a guide for a group of fur traders. Tom is one of the traders being led by Leo and Tom does not like Leo and his son, at all. Believe it or not, it seems like there was racism going on back in the old west. Leo has an Indian son from an Indian wife-that has since passed away-that Leo uses as his assistant guide and Tom just don't hanker to them. Domhnall is the leader of the traders that is trying to raise money for his soldiers and some settlers back home and Will is another trader in the team. After a bear attacks Leo and leaves him in pretty bad shape-the attack or actually a maul, looks realistically authentic-Tom leaves Leo and his son behind, to die. Tom actually helps the son on his journey to meet his ancestors in the happy hunting grounds, up in the sky. Leo crawls out of a hastily dug grave and goes after his revenge. Along the journey, Leo runs into other fur traders and Indians, falls off a cliff while riding a horse and climbs inside a dead animal, just to keep warm-kind of like what Luke Skywalker did. You gotta say one thing for him, he didn't know the meaning of the phrase, 'Just give up'. It's rated 'R' for violence, gory images, language and sexual content- including nudity and a sexual assault-and has a running time of 2 hours & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",7,2,6,6 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Good Story But Not Big On Action
","I saw 'Bridge of Spies', starring Tom Hanks-Saving Mr. Banks, Captain Phillips; Mark Rylance-The Gunman, The Other Boleyn Girl; Alan Alda-The Blacklist_tv, What Women Want and Amy Ryan-Goosebumps, Escape Plan.This is based on a true story that takes place in 1957. Steven Spielberg directs this cold war story about a Soviet spy captured on American soil, Mark, who is arrested and asked to move into one of our fine prison establishments, or maybe even be executed for treason. Tom plays a New York lawyer that is convinced by the C.I.A. to represent Mark-they think they should show the world that even a dirty Soviet spy deserves a good defense. Alan plays Tom's boss and agrees with the C.I.A. and tells Tom to go ahead and take the job. Around this same time, an American pilot, Francis Gary Powers, is shot down over Soviet air space, while taking reconnaissance pictures from a U2 spy plane at 70,000 feet. The C.I.A. wants Tom to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Mark for the pilot. Since Tom has to go to Germany for the talks, and it is as the wall is being built in Berlin so it is dangerous, Tom tells his wife, Amy, that he is going on a fishing trip-he doesn't want her to worry. The exchange of prisoners is to take place on a bridge between East Berlin and West Berlin, so that is where the title of the movie, Bridge of Spies, comes from. It is a good story-what else do you expect from a Steven Spielberg movie?-but light on action. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental.",6,6,14,16 October 2015
Split," M. Did A Good Job
","I saw 'Split', starring James McAvoy-The X-Men movies, The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe; Anya Taylor-Joy-Morgan, The Witch; Haley Lu Richardson-The Edge of Seventeen, The Bronze and Betty Buckley-Pretty Little Liars_tv, Eight is Enough_tv.This is a tense thriller that is written & directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who has had some ups and downs as far as his movie successes have gone. He did good on this one. James plays a man with 23 distinct personalities and he does a great job portraying each one of them with unique, individual physical gestures and even facial movements. Betty plays his psychiatrist that is trying to help him cope with DID- Dissociative Identity Disorder-which used to be just called having multiple personalities. Along comes a 24th personality called the Beast that takes charge and makes James kidnap 3 teen-aged girls and seclude them in a basement. Anya happened to be at a party for Haley when James makes his move on his intended targets of Haley and her other friend so Anya is just at the wrong place at the wrong time. But, there is more to things than first thought, as to be expected in M.'s movies. The rest of the movie has the girls trying to escape while James visits Betty to try to straighten himself out before the Beast takes complete control. Oh yeah, M. makes a cameo appearance and there is a connection to one of M.'s other movies-it is better to be surprised than for me to give it away here. It's rated 'PG-13' for behavior, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",7,1,9,21 January 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Different Versions of Beloved Hero
","I saw 'Spider_Man:Into the Spider_Verse', starring the voices of Shameik Moore-The Get Down_tv, Dope; Jake Johnson-New Girl_tv, The Mummy_2017; Hailee Steinfeld-The Pitch Perfect movies, Ender's Game; Nicolas Cage-Dog Eat Dog, the Ghost Rider movies and Liev Schreiber-Ray Donovan_tv, Salt.
This is an animated Spider_Man movie that gives you a look at the different Spider_Men from alternate dimensions-it's also the first animated Marvel movie to be rated 'PG'. Those familiar with the comics know all about these spin off heroes. Shameik plays Miles Morales/Spider_Man, who runs into Jake/Peter Parker/the original Amazing Spider_Man-notice the 'Amazing' in his name? That's how you tell them apart in the books-after Liev/the Kingpin causes a dimensional rift that lets the others visit his world. Hailee/Spider_Gwen and Nicolas/Spider_Man Noir are a couple of the other Spider_Men that make it through the rift. There is also a Japanese Manga robot Spider_Girl and a Spider_Pig. Jake and the others help train Shameik in the use of his new talents-some are a little different than Jakes'-to make him Spider ready. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo and I heard that this was his last voice_acting role. There is a lot of humor throughout the film and it is pretty good-sometimes I had a hard time hearing everything because of the audience laughing so loud. Some of it is even 'nods' to the live action films and tv shows. And make sure you stay after the end credits because there is a nice scene with another Spider_Man not shown earlier.
It's rated 'PG' for action violence, thematic elements and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.
I am a big Spider_Man fan-Amazing & otherwise-and I really enjoyed this look at the different versions of the beloved hero. I would buy this one on Blu_Ray.",8,10,64,7 December 2018
We're the Millers," Hilarious Adult Comedy
","I saw 'We're the Millers', starring Jennifer Aniston-Horrible Bosses, Marley & Me; Jason Sudeikis-SNL-t.v., Horrible Bosses; Emma Roberts-Scream 4, Hotel For Dogs; Will Poulter-The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, School of Comedy-t.v. and Ed Helms-The Hangover movies, Meet Dave.This is an adult comedy, and I say adult, because of the language and other factors involved-it's not for the little kids. Jason plays a low-level drug dealer with Ed as his boss. When circumstances force Jason into a bind with Ed, a solution is suggested. Ed wants Jason to go to Mexico and pick up a load of marijuana and bring it back to him. Jason decides to rent an RV and a family, to help disguise their crossing of the border-Border guards will not give him a second look if he looks like a wholesome family, deduces Jason. So, in his infinite wisdom, Jason enlists his stripper neighbor, Jennifer, his home alone next door neighbor kid, Will, and a homeless girl that he meets in an alley, Emma, as his family. Of course, things don't go according to plan. Along their journeys, they have to elude angry drug dealers, border guards and DEA agents that are all after them for various reasons. It is hilarious, but if you are offended easily, you may not like it. Lots of language and sexual situations-including some nudity, but unfortunately, not from Jennifer; although she does do a pretty good striptease dance. There are some bloopers and out takes as the end credits start-nothing at the very end. It's rated 'R' for language, drug material and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,10,22,7 August 2013
Divergent," Dauntless Effert
","I saw 'Divergent', starring Shailene Woodley-The Secret Life of the American Teenager_t.v., The O. C._t.v.; Theo James-Golden Boy_t.v., Underworld: Awakening; Ashley Judd-Olympus Has Fallen, Kiss the Girls; Zoe Kravitz-After Earth, X-Men: First Class, and oh yeah, she is the daughter of Lenny Kravitz & Lisa Bonet and Kate Winslet-Contagion, Titanic_1997.This is another one of those movies that is based on books aimed at teenagers-think 'Hunger Games', 'Twilight', etc., so you can expect sequels. The story takes place in Chicago in the not-too-distant future- I don't remember them mentioning a specific date. The world is divided into five factions,based on their personality traits. Abnegation is for selfless people that do anything for anybody, without expecting a reward-think boy scouts. Dauntless is a warrior clan that police the city when they are not thrill seeking by jumping off buildings and moving trains. Erudite is the really smart people. Candor is the totally honest people that never lie-great politicians. Amity is the pacifist people-think latter day hippies. When kids reach a certain age, they are tested to see which faction they will become a member of. Shailene plays a young girl that has to pick her future path, and like lots of teenagers, she just can not decide. She doesn't fit into any one faction and when that happens, you are called Divergent. But, being Divergent is highly frowned upon-it can get you banished or even killed-so Shailene keeps it to herself and joins the Dauntless. Theo is her trainer, and maybe future love interest? Ashley plays her mother. Zoe is a fellow recruit and Kate is the leader of the Erudite. FYI: At my theater-AMC- they were passing out little bracelets with the five different factions printed on them-I even had a women offer to buy mine from me before the movie started so that she could give it to her granddaughter. I kept it. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and sexuality-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 19 minutes. I have never read the books but I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu- Ray.",7,3,17,21 March 2014
Ender's Game," Thought Provoking Sci-Fi
","I saw 'Ender's Game', starring Asa Butterfield-Hugo, The Wolfman-2010; Harrison Ford-Cowboys & Aliens, Force 10 From Navarone; Hailee Steinfeld-Romeo and Juliet-2013, True Grit-2010; Abigail Breslin-The Call, Zombieland and Ben Kingsley-Iron Man 3, Hugo.This is a movie based on a 1985 book by Orson Scott Card-FYI: There has been talk about people protesting the film because of the personal views of Mr. Card; he is anti-gay. The story takes place years after an alien invasion of the Earth. The aliens-ant like creatures-were eventually defeated by the courage and skill of a single fighter pilot-in the right place at the right time, kind of like Randy Quaid in 'Independence Day'. But, they decided that it would be best if they started preparing for a return engagement; you know how ants always come back. Harrison is in charge of the recruiting and it is decided that the best chance of winning would be to start using younger cadets, since they have the ability to think fast and they have fast reflexes, probably due to all the video games they play. Asa is the top contender and is sent through basic training with other kids his age. Hailee is a fellow cadet, Abigail plays his sister, back on Earth, and Ben plays one of the trainers during the sessions. Ben sports head and facial tattoos that are sort of like a road map to his personal ancestry of his home back in New Zealand. The training sessions resemble video gaming and there is more to the storyline than you would expect, including a discussion of the dilemmas of war and there is a nice little twist at the end. FYI: The US Marine Corps has 'Ender's Game' on their recommended reading list for officers because of the lessons in training methodology, leadership and ethics. It's rated 'PG-13' for the action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,3,6,1 November 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Fantastic Stunts & Good Story
","I saw 'Mission:Impossible-Rogue Nation', starring Tom Cruise-Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages; Rebecca Ferguson-Hercules_2014, A One Way Trip to Antibes; Sean Harris-Deliver Us From Evil, Prometheus and Alec Baldwin-Rock of Ages, The Departed.This is the 5th installment in the MI franchise and it is a goody. The opening sequence has Tom jumping on top of an airplane that is rolling down the runway, about to take off-Oh yeah, it is filled with deadly nerve gas. He hangs on the side of the plane as it ascends and it is really Tom doing it, with no special effects or stuntmen. The amazing thing of the whole stunt is that Tom is 53 years old and looks like a 35 year old doing it. FYI: For the ladies out there, there are several scenes in the movie where Tom performs shirtless. As far as plot lines go, there is an organization- hinted at in the final moments of Ghost Protocol called The Syndicate-that is after the complete destruction of Tom and the whole IMF team. I guess you could call them a Rogue Nation. This Syndicate is run by Sean, who works from the shadows and Rebecca works for him-you can think of her as the opposite side of the coin to Tom. Alec plays the head of the C.I.A. and he wants to shut down the IMF too, but for different reasons-he doesn't like it that they break so many rules and get things done that the C.I.A. can't accomplish.....or maybe, do you think he is just the tiniest bit jealous? Who knows. So while Tom and his IMF team are trying to save the world, they are also on the run from all sides; good guys and bad. Besides the opening plane stunt, there are plenty of car and or motorcycle chases, underwater stunts and plain old physical fisticuffs to keep you on the edge of your seat. There is nothing after the end credits but if you see it in IMAX-like I did-the opening IMAX countdown that is usually done before the movie starts, has a Mission:Impossible style countdown that is intertwined with it. I saw Tom on a talk show and he said that he is already working on the next one in the series, numero 6. It's rated 'PG-13' for the action, violence and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. Fantastic stunts, good story, I guess you could say that I enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,0,1,31 July 2015
Dunkirk," Slow & Boring
","I saw 'Dunkirk', starring Kenneth Branagh-Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Valkyrie; Cillian Murphy-In the Heart of the Sea, 28 Days Later; Tom Hardy-The Revenant, Inception and making his movie acting debut, Harry Styles-He is from the boy band, One Direction.This movie was a bit of a dud for me. It is based on true events in 1940 during WW 2. It's directed by Christopher Nolan-Interstellar, The Dark Knight movies and Inception.The movie looks great. But, it is incredibly boring. Maybe die hard history buffs might enjoy it more than I did. For those unfamiliar with the situation, the Allies, including the British, Belgium and French soldiers, were surrounded at Dunkirk, France on 3 sides by German forces, with the English channel at their backs. It was about 26 miles across the channel to Dover, England. The troops were trying to evacuate while being pounded by German forces, including enemy planes. Kenneth plays the leader of the English forces just trying to get home. Cillian and Harry are a couple of soldiers that get stranded off of sinking rescue ships and Tom is an Allied fighter pilot trying to protect the escaping boats from being sunk. It is a testament to the spirit of helping people in a crisis-British civilian vessels were used to help ferry soldiers across the channel-with about 360,000 of the 400,000 troops eventually being rescued. But it is not so much as a war movie but more of a rescue and evacuation movie. There are a few air battle scenes, but overall, it was just slow. It's rated 'PG-13' for war violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It might be alright as a rental.",5,7,17,22 July 2017
The Lego Movie," Good Fun For Adults & Kids
","I saw 'The Lego Movie', starring the voices of Chris Pratt-Parks and Recreation-t.v., Jennifer's Body; Elizabeth Banks-The Hunger Games movies, Pitch Perfect; Will Arnett-The Millers-t.v., Arrested Development-t.v.; Morgan Freeman-Last Vegas, The Bucket List and Will Ferrell-The Anchorman movies, Old School.This is the first big screen Lego movie-there have been others, but they were straight to video-and it was better than I was expecting it to be. It was good fun for the adults and the kids, with plenty of jokes for everyone to enjoy. Everything is made to look like it is made from Legos, even the water, fire and the smoke effects. There are lots of recognizable Lego creations-and a few other licensed characters-that make an appearance, including some of my favorite super heroes. Will F. plays the villain that wants to use an artifact called the Kragle to destroy the Lego universe. Morgan is a wise old sage that passes out advice and knows about a secret artifact that can stop Will F.'s dastardly plans, but he needs a special person. Chris plays an ordinary engineer, striving to become a Master Builder, that tears up buildings and then builds them back, good as new. Elizabeth comes to the conclusion that Chris is the chosen one from Morgan's visions and decides to help him achieve his true potential on a quest to stop Will F.. Will A. plays Batman, Elizabeth's boyfriend. There is a scene with a live actor, near the end, that uses one of the voice actors. It's rated 'PG' for mild violence and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Null,0,2,8 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," True Story of AIDS Battle
","I saw 'Dallas Buyers Club', starring Matthew McConaughey-Magic Mike, Tropic Thunder; Jennifer Garner-Juno, Dude,Where's My Car?; Jared Leto- Lord of War, Fight Club and Steve Zahn-A Perfect Getaway, Sahara.This is based on a true story, concerning the AIDS crisis. Matthew plays an electrician/part time rodeo bull rider in the 1980's. He gets some unsettling news after a routine doctor visit; he has AIDS and only about 30 days left to live. After the usual denials-he thought only gay people got it-and the emotions that most people go through after such a diagnosis, Matthew reads everything he can find on the subject and decides to use other forms of medications. They are not illegal drugs, they are just not approved by the US FDA. He has to travel to other countries-Mexico, Japan-to bring the unapproved drugs back and gets around the legal aspects by starting the Dallas Buyers Club-anyone can join for a fee and all the drugs are free. Jennifer plays a doctor that believes in what he is doing. Jared is a gay transdresser-he has not had the surgery but does prefer to dress like a woman-that befriends Matthew and becomes a business partner. Steve plays an old childhood friend of Matthew's, who is now a policeman. I read that Matthew lost 38 pounds for the role. It's rated 'R' for language, sexual content-including nudity-and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",6,1,4,29 November 2013
Now You See Me," Robin Hood Magicians
","I saw 'Now You See Me', starring Jesse Eisenberg-The Social Network, Zombieland, Woody Harrelson-The Hunger Games, Zombieland, Mark Ruffalo-The Avengers, 13 Going on 30 and Morgan Freeman-Olympus Has Fallen, Red.This is a movie about illusionists that pull bank heists but don't keep their ill-gotten gains; they reward their audiences with the money. Jesse and Woody are 2 of the 4 prestidigitators that are gathered together by an unknown benefactor for unknown reasons-at least they are unknown until the end of the film. Each one of the 4-they call themselves 'The 4 Horsemen'-have different specialties-one is a mentalist , one is an escape artist , etc.. After their first heist, Mark-an F.B.I. agent-starts trying to apprehend the group but has no luck. Morgan plays a famous former magician that is now a famous debunker of magicians-he reveals how they do their tricks and is enlisted by Mark to help him catch the thieves. I have always been interested in magic tricks and the way they work so this movie was right up my alley-most of the tricks are explained later in the movie. It's rated 'PG-13' for language and sexual content and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. I enjoyed this one and I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",Null,1,2,31 May 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The Best X-Men Movie in the Series
","I saw 'X-Men:Days of Future Past', starring Hugh Jackman-Real Steel, Swordfish; James McAvoy-Wanted, Band of Brothers_t.v., Michael Fassbender-The Counselor, Jonah Hex; Jennifer Lawrence-Katniss in the Hunger Games movies, Winter's Bone and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_t.v., Death at a Funeral.This is based on a comic book storyline from the X-Men comic books from somewhere around 1981. It's directed by Bryan Singer-he directed the first two X-Men movies-and I think this film is the best one in the series. It combines both the older and the newer characters by using time travel. The story starts off in the not too distant future, where Sentinels- mutant hunting robots-are eliminating any and all mutants wherever they can find them. The surviving X-Men come up with a plan to send Hugh-Wolverine-into the past, to prevent the building of the Sentinels. It seems that Hugh is the only X-Man that could survive the trip, what with his unique healing factor. Peter-Bolivar Trask-creates the mutant hunting robots in 1973 and Jennifer-Mystique- assassinates him, which causes the speedy production of the Sentinels. Hugh has to jump back in time, get the younger versions of James-Charles Xavier-and Michael-Magneto-to help him find Jennifer and then stop her, before the Sentinels kill the last mutants in the bleak future. There are several new mutants to keep an eye on; Warpath, Blink and Quicksilver are a few and Quicksilver is a real scene stealer. There is also a scene after the end credits which sets up the next X-Men movie; it shows a brief glimpse of the next villain and his name starts with an 'A'. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",9,1,2,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Fantastic
","I saw 'Captain America: Civil War', starring Chris Evans-Snowpiercer, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World; Robert Downey Jr.-The Sherlock Holmes movies, Gothika; Sebastian Stan-The Martian, Hot Tub Time Machine; Chadwick Boseman-Gods of Egypt, 42 and Tom Holland-In the Heart of the Sea, How I Live Now.This is the third movie in the Captain America solo series-not counting the Avengers movies-but it is almost like an Avengers movie because of all the heroes in it, both old and new ones. The story starts out with the search for Sebastian/Bucky/Winter Soldier. It seems that the government agencies are upset with the Avengers collateral damage they have caused in their fights with the villains and want to put restrictions on the heroes. Basically, limit their actions and make them register-including revealing their identities-becoming super powered policemen, answering to the governments. Robert/Iron Man is all for it but Chris/Captain America is not. This difference of opinion leads to the Civil War, with the Black Panther, the Vision, Black Widow, War Machine and Spider-Man on Robert's team and Bucky, the Falcon, Scarlett Witch, Hawkeye and the Ant-Man on Chris' team-Thor and the Hulk do not show up. Chadwick plays the Black Panther-he has his first solo movie coming out in 2018-and Tom is Spider-Man-his is in 2017-both doing excellent jobs portraying their characters here. This story is based on a 2006 comic book series by the same name. There is also a villain by the name of Zemo that makes an appearance but he is not a major threat. Something happens between Chris and Robert-besides having a different opinion on how to operate as a hero-that changes their relationship. There is a knock down, drag out fight scene at an airport between all the combatants that is fantastic-I can't wait to see the movie again. I had heard something about a hero dying in the movie, and there is a funeral in it, but it is not for an Avenger. Oh yeah, Stan Lee makes his usual cameo; look for the Fed-ex delivery man. As the end credits start, there is a scene. There is also one at the very end, after the end credits. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, action and mayhem-lots of mayhem-and has a running time of 2 hours & 27 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",10,8,18,6 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Adult Spin Off of Harry Potter
","I saw 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them', starring Eddie Redmayne-Jupiter Ascending, My Week With Marilyn; Dan Fogler-The Goldbergs_tv, Balls of Fury; Katherine Waterston-Steve Jobs, Taking Woodstock and Colin Farrell-Saving Mr. Banks-Crazy Heart.This is the beginning of a 5 picture franchise that is a spin off of the Harry Potter series-not a sequel or a prequel, but a spin off. It's written by J.K. Rowling and it is in the same Potterverse but it takes place about 70 years earlier, in 1926. Eddie plays Newt Scamander, a person of magic that is traveling to New York from Britain while researching his book about magical creatures-FYI: His book is referenced in the Harry Potter movies as being studied by students at Hogwarts. Eddie is carrying a suitcase with some of these magical creatures inside it but some get loose and draw the attention of the U.S. magical counsel. Katherine is sort of a rule enforcer for the counsel that tries to keep the magical world and the human world separate. Don't want the frail humans to panic, of course, so if a human sees something that they shouldn't, they are magically made to forget whatever they have seen. Oh yeah, in the Potter movies, humans were called Muggles. Here, they use the term No-Mags, which is short for No-Magic, referring to humans that don't have magical abilities. Dan is a No-Mag that becomes friends with Eddie. Colin is a person of magic that is on the counsel. The effects are fantastic and so are the creatures and there is a big name star that makes a cameo near the end of the movie, as the villain. I was a fan of the Harry Potter movies so it is good to get into a version of them that has adults in it, instead of kids. It's rated 'PG- 13' for fantasy action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. If you liked the Harry Potter movies, you should enjoy this one-and the 4 more in the works. I liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,9,17,18 November 2016
The Conjuring 2," Good Scares/Good Sequel
","I saw 'The Conjuring 2', starring Patrick Wilson-Fargo_tv, Watchmen; Vera Farmiga-Bates Motel_tv, The Departed; Frances O'Connor-Windtalkers, Bedazzled and Madison Wolfe-Keanu, Home Sweet Hell.This is a sequel to the 2013 movie that tells the real life stories of Ed & Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators-portrayed by Patrick & Vera. They make a great team, with Vera having psychic visions and Patrick handling all the heavy lifting. James Wan is once again the director-besides the 2013 original Conjuring, he also directed Furious 7, Insidious & Saw. This story takes place in 1977, just as Patrick & Vera have finished checking out the unwanted horrors in Amityville-Yep, THAT Amityville-and are about ready for a well deserved rest. The first movie takes place before the Amityville investigation and this one is after it. The Church has another case lined up for them in England. It seems that a single mother of 4 children, Frances, is having problems with some sort of demonic possession of one of her daughters, Madison. When Patrick & Vera arrive, they are met with lots of skepticism, both from the regular public and professional scholars. FYI: Even in our present time, there are people that believe it was all just a hoax. There are lots of good, scary moments and as the end credits start, you get to see photos of the real participants and also hear an actual recording of an interview between the Warrens and the possessed little girl-played in the movie by Madison. It's rated 'R' for terror and horror violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 13 minutes. I enjoyed it as much as the first one and would buy it on DVD.",7,2,5,12 June 2016
Inside Out," Don't Grow Up
","I saw 'Inside Out', starring the voices of Amy Poehler-Parks and Recreation_tv, Blades of Glory; Bill Hader-SNL_tv, Men in Black 3; Lewis Black-The Daily Show_tv, Hannah and Her Sisters and Kaitlyn Dias-The Shifting, Burial.This is a Pixar animated movie that takes a look at the emotions of a teenaged girl-actually, I think she was 11 years old, if I remember correctly. It's directed by Pete Docter, the director of Up & Monsters, Inc. and he was also the writer of Up, Wall-E, Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story 1 & 2-Not too shabby for a resume'. He said that he got the idea for the movie from watching his own teenaged daughter and wondering what was going on in her mind. I don't know if that is true or not but I seem to remember an old TV show called Herman's Head that had a similar idea, although he was a business young adult instead of a young girl. Anyway, the premise of the movie is that we get to take a look inside the mind of Kaitlyn, an 11 year old girl. Some of her emotions consist of Amy as Joy, Bill as Fear and Lewis as Anger. I think there were a total of 5 emotions portrayed-sadness and disgust were the other 2-and the emotions use glass balls to hold Kaitlyn's memories and store them in a command center. The problems start when Kaitlyn's parents decide to move from Minnesota to San Francisco because of a job opportunity for dad. Kaitlyn takes it the hardest; new house, new school, new friends, etc. and things get a little complicated after an accident in emotion central. I liked how they would show the maintenance people in her mind whose job was to get rid of unused thoughts- if they haven't been used in a while, out they go. It has enough going on that should keep both adults and kids entertained. FYI:There is a scene as the credits start but the only thing at the very end is a little written piece of advice saying something like; Dedicated to Our Children. Don't Grow Up. Ever. It's rated 'PG' for some action and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,2,21,19 June 2015
Yesterday," Interesting Concept
","I saw 'Yesterday', starring Himesh Patel-Damned_tv, Eastenders_tv; Lily James-Baby Driver, Downton Abbey_tv; Ed Sheeran-yes, the singer, and you might have seen him in the Game of Thrones_tv or Bridget Jones's Baby and Kate McKinnon-The Spy Who Dumped Me, Rough Night.
This is an interesting concept about what if no one had ever heard of the rock group The Beatles or their music. It reminded me of the old Marvel comic book series called 'What If?'. Himesh plays a struggling musician that gets hit by a bus when power all over the world goes off for about 12 seconds-there is a quick explanation given as to the cause. When he wakes up, nobody has a clue as to who the Beatles are. There are several other things that have magically disappeared from everyone's minds, too-except for Himesh's-such as the soft drink Coke. Lily is Himesh's manager/chauffeur-she drives him everywhere since he can't drive-and is one of the first people that stuns him with the lack of knowledge of who the Beatles are. When he plays a Beatles song, everyone thinks he is a genius song writer and he even tells Lily that he didn't write the songs but she doesn't believe him. Ed playing himself, becomes friends with Hamish after hearing one of his masterpieces and offers him a job as his opening act. Kate is Ed's manager and tries to get Hamish's business by taking over as his manager, too, squeezing Lily out of a job. Hamish feels bad about taking undue credit but things keep escalating. It has lots of the Beatles songs-I think I read that it has 17 songs they got the rites to-and there is a couple of cameos, including one big whopper.
It's rated 'PG-13' for suggestive content and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and if you are a Beatles fan, you probably will, too. I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,14,31,29 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Trip Down Memory Lane
","I saw 'Avengers: Endgame', starring Robert Downey Jr.-the Sherlock Holmes movies, The Shaggy Dog_2006; Chris Evans-Gifted, The Losers; Scarlett Johansson-Rough Night, We Bought a Zoo and Josh Brolin-Dead Pool 2, Men in Black 3.
This is the conclusion of last years' Infinity War-2018-and it is a nice trip down memory lane. The story line involves time travel, so past scenes from previous movies are seen-hence the trip down memory lane. Stan Lee has his last cameo in one of those time travel scenes and he is digitally de_aged to look younger. Robert, Chris, Scarlett and the rest of the surviving Avengers are left to deal with the aftermath of Josh's finger snap-remember, it wiped out half of the population in a blink of an eye-as they try to some how restore order to the universe. It's been 5 years and nobody has come up with a plan. Things are looking bleak. If you have ever read any comic books, you know things have a way of working out but there are consequences. That's what makes a good story. It's best if you don't know too much before seeing the movie, but I can tell you that there are some fantastic fight scenes, lots of humor and you get to see people like you've never seen them before-at least not in the MCU movies. And, there are casualties. There is not any surprise scenes during or after the end credits, however, the original 6 Avenger actors' autographs are shown when their names appear on screen.
It's rated 'PG-13' for sci_fi violence and action and language and has a running time of 3 hours & 1 minute-so make sure you hit the restrooms before the movie.
I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",10,122,230,27 April 2019
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Good Action-Packed Sequel-Better than the First
","I saw 'The Hobbit:The Desolation of Smaug', starring Ian McKellen- Magneto in the X-Men movies, Last Action Hero; Martin Freeman-The World's End, Hot Fuzz; Richard Armitage-Captain America:The First Avenger, MI5-t.v.; Evangeline Lilly-Real Steel, Lost-t.v.; Orlando Bloom-The Three Musketeers-2011, Black Hawk Down and the voice of Benedict Cumberbatch-Star Trek Into Darkness, The Other Boleyn Girl.This is the second of the Hobbit trilogy, which is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings films, which are all based on the books written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Peter Jackson is the director. The title, 'Desolation of Smaug', refers to where Smaug-the Dragon-lives and the wastelands surrounding his home. Ian-Gandalf-leads Martin-Bilbo-and the 13 dwarfs on the quest to get the fallen kingdom of the dwarfs back from Benedict-the Dragon/Necromancer. FYI: Benedict does the voices of the Dragon and Necromancer, but they are two separate characters. Richard- Thorin-is the dwarf leader. Along their journey they cross paths with some Elfs, including Orlando-Legolas-and a new character, Evangeline- Tauriel. And when I say a new character, I mean she was written specifically for the movie and was not in the books. Evangeline is pretty bad-ass in her role, too; she has quite a few good fight scenes. Martin is a little more heroic here, too. He does get to put his new found ring to good use. In general, this movie is better than the first part, which I did like, but it was a little slow. This one is more action-packed. My only problem is the abrupt ending. It reminded me of the same thing they did in 'The Hunger Games:Catching Fire', a few weeks ago. It just stops in mid action, which is supposed to set you up for the next installment. It is rated 'PG-13' for violence and some frightening images and has a running time of 2 hours & 41 minutes. It was better than part 1 and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,3,7,13 December 2013
Toy Story 4," Good Family Entertainment
","I saw 'Toy Story 4', starring the voices of Tom Hanks-Bridge of Spies, Joe Versus the Volcano; Tim Allen-Last Man Standing_tv, The Santa Clause; Annie Potts-Young Sheldon_tv, Pretty in Pink and Tony Hale-Veep_tv, Larry the Cable Guy:Health Inspector.
It's been 24 years since the first Toy Story-1995 was the first, 1999 was the second & 2010 was the third-and it is still a good family entertainment film for both kids and adults. Don Rickles passed away in 2017-he voiced Mr Potato Head-but they did use previous recordings of his voice for this film, with Mr Rickles' family's permission, of course. The music is still by Randy Newman, too. Annie/Bo Peep is separated from the gang at the beginning of the movie-don't worry, she shows up later-and a new character is created, Tony/Forky, who happens to be made from an eating utensil. After an accident on a family road trip separates Tony from the family, Tom/Woody and Tim/Buzz Lightyear lead a search and rescue mission to bring him home. They meet some other new toys and valuable life lessons along their journeys. There are some scenes during the end credits and one at the very end, too.
It's rated 'G' for some mild language and frightening and intense scenes and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.
If you liked the previous entrys in the franchise, you should like this one, too. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,3,23 June 2019
Non-Stop," Great Neeson Vehicle
","I saw 'Non-Stop', starring Liam Neeson-The Taken movies, Darkman; Julianne Moore-Carrie_2013, The Big Lebowski; Scoot McNairy-12 Years a Slave, Bones_t.v.; Michelle Dockery-Downtown Abbey_t.v., Hanna and Lupita Nyong'O-12 Years a Slave, and this one is her second big screen movie.This is a perfect Liam Neeson movie, with lots of tense action and he gets to grimace a lot, as only Liam can, as he delivers his lines. Liam plays an air marshal with problems. He had a tragic incident happen in his personal life and has become a bit of a drinker. He is also smoking pretty heavily so this makes him appear a little irrational at times. His latest assignment is on a transatlantic non-stop flight from America to England. About mid-flight, Liam starts getting text messages from a fellow passenger saying that they will kill someone on board the plane every 20 minutes unless he gets 150 million dollars in a Swiss bank account. Liam tells the pilot and even his air marshal supervisor but they don't believe him and think it is just a prank. Of course, they think differently, sometime around the time that the third body pops up dead. Julianne and Scoot play fellow passengers that fall under Liam's suspicions as being the terrorist and Michelle and Lupita are stewardesses. It is rated 'PG-13' for violence, language, drug references and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Null,0,3,28 February 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Better Than the First One
","I saw 'How to Train Your Dragon 2', starring the voices of Jay Baruchel- Robocop_2014, Tropic Thunder; Gerard Butler-Olympus Has Fallen, 300; Cate Blanchett-The Monuments Men, Hanna and Djimon Hounsou-Eragon, Gladiator. This is the second of a trilogy-in case you could not tell by the number in the title. It takes place about 5 years after the last film. Jay is the son of the Viking chief, Gerard, and has started to explore his world more, including making maps of the new lands. The Vikings have started playing a game, which involves flying their dragons around in circles and catching sheep that are hurled into the air. They then dunk the sheep, which kind of reminded me of the game that was played in the Harry Potter movies-I think it was called quiditch, but I'm not sure of the spelling. Anyway, on his searches Jay finds more dragon riders. Cate, his long lost mother, who was thought to be dead, is on an island and in charge of some friendly dragons. Then there is the evil dragon rider, Djimon, who wants to conquer the Vikings and eventually, the rest of the world. He also has a past history with Gerard and adds an omega- dragon to the mix. It's rated 'PG' for the violence and some mild rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes. I thought it was better than the first one and I would buy it on Blu- Ray.",7,1,13,16 July 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Entertaining Quirky Comedy
","I saw 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', starring Ralph Fiennes-Skyfall, The Hurt Locker; Tony Revolori-Sons of Tucson_t.v., The Perfect Game; F. Murray Abraham-The Good Wife_t.v., Last Action Hero; Saoirse Ronan- Hanna, The Clinic_t.v. and Edward Norton-The Bourne Legacy, The Incredible Hulk.This is an entertaining, quirky comedy by the mind of Wes Anderson-he directed and co-wrote it. If you are not familiar with his other work, he also directed Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums, just to name a few. Ralph plays the concierge at a popular European hotel, The Grand Budapest Hotel, during the 1930's. Tony is his lobby boy and right-hand man, that is learning the ropes of his job from Ralph. F. Murray plays the adult version of Tony that is telling the story, in flashbacks. When a famous painting is stolen from a guest, a Keystone cop style adventure begins. There are chases, prison incarcerations, prison breaks, more chases and even a big gun battle in the hotel. Saoirse plays a love interest for Tony and Edward plays the local constable that is always in pursuit of answers. I must say, Wes must be friends with a lot of famous actors because there are a lot of cameos in this movie. I remember seeing Jude Law, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe and I think I saw George Clooney. I'm sure I missed some but those are the ones that I remember. It's rated 'R' for language, sexual content-including nudity-and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I would probably buy it on DVD but it's not for everyone-it depends on if you like quirky.",6,0,4,14 April 2014
The Favourite," Comical But Not a Comedy
","I saw 'The Favourite', Olivia Colman-The Lobster, Hot Fuzz; Rachel Weisz-The Lobster, About a Boy; Nicholas Hoult-X_Men:Apocalypse, About a Boy and Emma Stone-La La Land, The Amazing Spider_Man 2.
This is a period piece-specifically, 18Th century England-that is loosely based on actual events. Olivia plays Queen Anne, a rather sickly queen that has let her long time friend Lady Sarah run every day queenly type events. Rachel plays Lady Sarah. Winston Churchill is a descendant of Lady Sarah. Olivia has gout-among other problems-and has to use crutches or a wheel chair to get around at times. Olivia and Rachel have more than just a friendly relationship going on. When Emma-Rachel's cousin-comes to town, looking for a job, things get real cat fighty like when Olivia takes a liking to Emma. Rachel is very jealous-wanting to keep Olivia to herself-and the games begin, each one trying to fend for Olivia's good will. Nicholas plays a politician pushing for his own agendas from Olivia. The movie is comical but it's not a comedy, like it is being advertised as. I would have liked it more except for the ending-it was just a little weird.
It's rated 'R' for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-maybe with a better ending-but it would be alright, as a rental.",6,0,1,6 January 2019
It Follows," Good But Could Have Been Better
","I saw 'It Follows', starring Maika Monroe-Labor Day, The Bling Ring; Keir Gilchrist-United States of Tara_tv, The Rocker; Daniel Zovatto- Laggies, Revenge_tv and Olivia Luccardi-Orange is the New Black_tv, Girls_tv.This is a horror movie that could have been a lot better if they would have explained a few things more. Parts of it reminded me of the original Halloween, Final Destination and Invasion of the Body Snatchers mashed together. Maika plays a teenager that likes a certain new boy. He takes her to a secluded area and they do what teenagers in these types of movies do, have sex, consensually of course. He then drugs her and ties her to a chair-not consensually and not what most teenagers do in these types of movies-and when she wakes up, he tells her that he has passed 'it' to her-'it' being some sort of sexual curse that can be given to another person by having sex with them. According to the curse, there is a zombie-like creature that walks-never runs-after the cursed person. It can take different forms-men, women, old, young-and it is relentless in it's walking. If it catches the person, it kills them and then it backtracks down the list of sexually active teens, to the originator. Olivia plays one of Maika's girl friends and Keir and Daniel are male friends that volunteer to take the curse from Maika by sacrificing themselves and having sex with her. There is nudity- sometimes, the walker is a nude man or woman-and during the end credits it said that it was filmed in Detroit, Michigan. It's not a bad movie, I just think it would have been better if they would have given more background information about the curse, the walker and the bodies it used. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.",6,1,15,27 March 2015
Legend," History of Kray Brothers
","I saw 'Legend', starring Tom Hardy-Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, Inception; Emily Browning-Pompeii, Sucker Punch; Taron Egerton- Kingsman:The Secret Service, Testament of Youth and Chazz Palminteri- Rizzoli & Isles_tv, The Usual Suspects.This is based on a true story about the most famous gangsters in British history, the Kray brothers. They were twins, Ronnie & Reggie, and they are both portrayed by Tom and he does a fantastic job. He changes his voice and personality so that it gives the feeling of watching two different actors. Their story takes place in the 1960's in London. Tom/Reggie is the smart one and Tom/Ronnie is the paranoid schizophrenic. Tom/Reggie meets a nice girl, Emily, and gets married. Tom/Ronnie likes men and spends some time in a mental hospital. Taron plays Tom/Ronnie's main boy friend and right hand man. Chazz plays an American mobster that wants to expand the American mafia's business into Europe, using the Kray brothers' help. The story is typical gangster narrative but the performance from Tom is really good. It's rated 'R' for violence, language, drug material and sexual content- no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be a good rental.",6,2,3,9 January 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Bloodbath
","I saw 'Avengers:Infinity War', starring Robert Downey Jr.-The Judge, The Shaggy Dog_2006; Chris Hemsworth-12 Strong, Vacation_2015; Benedict Cumberbatch-Zoolander 2, August:Osage County and Josh Brolin-Only the Brave, Sicario.
This is the best super hero movie that I have ever seen. It is the first part of a two part story-the second part will come out next year, as they were both shot at the same time. This is the 10th anniversary of the Marvel cinematic universe-the first movie being Iron Man in 2008-and I think the 19th movie overall. This one has almost any character you can think of-I read that there is about 64 main characters that show up. Thanos is the villain here, portrayed by Josh in magnificent form. He is after the 6 Infinity stones, incredibly powerful gem stones that when combined, would make him unstoppable. Each gem is in a different location and each has a different power; Space, Mind, Power, Reality, Time and Soul. Benedict is in possession of one, as is the Vision, so you can guess who is coming to town on a hunting spree. Robert and Chris both have their shots at Josh, with little chance of slowing him down. Why does Thanos want these gems so badly? He simply believes the universe is overpopulated-resources, food, etc.-and just wants to cull the herd a bit to make it a better universe for everyone else. He travels across the galaxy destroying about half of a planets population and smiles while he does it. The heroes have to unite in their fight and that's when you see some pretty awesome fights. And there are casualties-you might even say it's a bloodbath. And I'm talking some of the A-listers here. There is the usual Stan Lee cameo-look for him driving a bus full of kids-and there is a scene after the end credits, so don't leave too early-there is another casualty.
It's rated 'PG-13' for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, language and crude references and has a running time of 2 hours & 29 minutes.
I loved this movie and can hardly wait for part 2. I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",10,2,7,28 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Very Entertaining With Some twists
","I saw 'Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood', starring Leonardo DiCaprio-The Wolf of Wall Street, Critters 3; Brad Pitt-Deadpool 2, World War Z; Margot Robbie-Suicide Squad, The Wolf of Wall Street and Damon Herriman-Justified_tv, The Lone Ranger_2013.
This is Quentin Tarantino's 9th film, and I heard him say on a talk show that he is only going to make one more movie and then call it quits-for a total of 10 movies. I hope not, and people are always changing their minds, but that's what he said. Anyway, this one takes place in 1969 Los Angeles, during the end of the hippie movement and the Charles Manson killings. Leo is a fading tv action star that is looking for his next big break. Things are so bad that he might even have to go to Italy and do spaghetti westerns. Brad is his stunt double and personal driver-Leo lost his license-and his best friend. Margot plays Sharon Tate and for all those fans of her, they show clips from The Wrecking Crew with the real Sharon Tate. Margot lives next door to Leo in Beverly Hills. Damon plays Charles Manson and I'm sure that you remember what he and his Manson family did. There are lots of cameos: I remember seeing Bruce Dern, Luke Perry-in his last role-Dakota Fanning, Al Pacino, Kurt Russell and Timothy Olyphant, and I'm sure I'm forgetting a few. Remember the title of the movie, Once Upon a Time...because Quentin plays loose with some actual facts, but that only makes it entertaining in my opinion. For instance, there is a fight between Bruce Lee and Brad. Near the end, things get violent and bloody-it's a Quentin Tarantino movie, remember?-but it is very entertaining with some twists. During the end credits, there is a cigarette commercial for Red Apple cigarettes starring Leo-he smoked all through the film-that is pretty funny.
It's rated 'R' for language, graphic violence, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 41 minutes.
If you like Quentin Tarantino movies then you will probably enjoy this one. I know I did and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,11,17,27 July 2019
Gone Girl," Great Story, Bad Ending
","I saw 'Gone Girl', starring Ben Affleck-Argo, Daredevil; Rosamund Pike- Jack Reacher, Johnny English Reborn; Neil Patrick Harris-How I Met Your Mother_tv, Undercover Brother and Tyler Perry-all those Madea movies, Star Trek_2009. This is based on a book that was written by Gillian Flynn. I have not read the book but this is a very good and suspenseful movie. My only problem is with the ending and I can not go into details here, without spoiling things. In fact, the whole movie keeps you guessing about who did what-and why-up until you find out exactly what is going on. Ben and Rosamund are a married couple that are coming up on their fifth wedding anniversary. Ben comes home to find his wife missing and signs of a struggle. He calls the police and things get interesting. Questions are asked by the police and the media-did Ben murder her, was she kidnapped? The story goes back and forth from the present time, where Rosalund is missing and everyone is looking for her, and then jumps to five years in the past, and how she met Ben and their life leading up to the present. Neil plays a former boyfriend of Rosamund's that shows up to help look for her and Tyler plays a lawyer that wants to defend Ben, in case he should need a good lawyer. Like I said, it is an excellent story, with plenty of twists and turns that will keep you guessing, but that ending? I remember hearing the disappointment, not only from myself but from other movie-goers when it was over and it was not a pretty sight. It is rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 28 minutes. I enjoyed about 95% of the movie and I would probably buy it on DVD. Maybe the DVD will have an alternate ending.",7,1,24,3 October 2014
Get Out," Black Stepford Wives
","I saw 'Get Out', starring Daniel Kaluuya-Kick_Ass 2, Johnny English Reborn; Allison Williams-This is her first movie but she was on a few TV shows, Girls_tv, The Mindy Project_tv, Oh yeah, she is the daughter of newsman Brian Williams; Bradley Whitford-I Saw the Light, Billy Madison; Catherine Keener-Bad Grandpa, Death to Smoochy and Stephen Root-Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, Drillbit Taylor.This is a horror thriller that is written and directed by Jordan Peele, of Key & Peele_tv fame. It kind of reminded me of a black version of the 1975 movie, The Stepford Wives. Daniel-an African_American-and Allison-a Caucasian-have been dating for about 5 months. It has come to the important stage in their relationship where Daniel must meet her parents, and he is nervous-He even asks her if she has told her parents that he is Black and she says, 'No, because it doesn't matter, my parents are not racists!' Bradley and Catherine play her parents. There are subtle hints that something is a little off when he arrives at their country side estate. Bradley and Catherine throw a party and almost all the guests are White and they all act strange, too. Some will say odd things like, 'I voted for Obama and would vote for him again for a third term, if I could!' or 'Isn't Tiger Woods amazing!' Some even grab his biceps and say something like, 'Wow, you are strong!' Stephen plays one of the guests at the party. There are a few Black people that show up, like the maid and a yardman but they act strange, too, more like robotic zombies. To make matters worse, Daniel finds out that there have been many cases of Black people gone missing in the area. I don't want to give anything away here-it's better to be surprised-but this really is a horror movie that gets pretty bloody near the end-with a little humor thrown in, mostly by a friend of Daniel's that works for the TSA. It's rated 'R' for violence, bloody images, language and sexual content- no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,7,22,24 February 2017
Aladdin," They Did Good On This One
","I saw 'Aladdin', starring Will Smith-the Bad Boys movies, Suicide Squad; Mena Massoud-Strange But True, Tom Clacy's Jack Ryan_tv; Naomi Scott-Power Rangers_2017, The 33 and Marwan Kenzari-Murder on the Orient Express_2017, Ben_Hur_2016.
This is another of Disney's live action remakes of one of their classic animated movies. It's been a while since I've seen the original 1992 movie but they did good on this one. Mena plays Aladdin, an extraordinary street thief that falls in love with Naomi/Jasmine, the princess. Will plays the genie that grants 3 wishes to whomever rubs the lamp. Marwan is the king's chief advisor, who has plans to take over the kingdom for his own-that's the way villains think-by getting Mena to steal the magic lamp. Things change when Mena decides to keep it and use it to win the beautiful Naomi. Will does not just impersonate the great performance of the late great Robin Williams. He puts his own spin on it just enough so that it is different but it also reminds you of Robin Williams, too. FYI: Just in case you did not know it, this movie is a musical with lots of singing and dancing. I did recognize a few of the songs so they did use at least some from the earlier incarnation. This movie is directed by Guy Ritchie, who directed the new Sherlock Holmes movies and RocknRolla.
It's rated 'PG' for some action/peril and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes.

","I took my wife to see 'Frozen', starring the voices of Kristen Bell- Gossip Girl-t.v., Pootie Tang; Idina Menzel-Glee-t.v., Rent; Jonathan Groff-Glee-t.v., Taking Woodstock and Josh Gad-The Internship, The Rocker.This is a Disney animated classic-in-the-makings. It is based on the Hans Christian Andersen classic fairy tale, 'The Snow Queen', and it is a musical-lots of singing here. Kristen plays the younger sister to Idina, who is the next in line to become Queen, after her parents. As a child, Idina learns that she has magical ice powers that are triggered when she becomes emotional-she has an accident that nearly kills her sister, Kristen. When they get older, Idina has another incident that sends the whole kingdom into an eternal winter and decides to go into exile so that she does not do any more harm. Kristen goes after her and in the search, she meets Jonathan, an ice peddler and Josh, a talking snowman-everything talks in a Disney movie. The movie is very focused on the relationship between the two sisters. During the end credits, there is a special disclaimer for something Jonathan says during the movie- it's one of those, 'What he said was his own opinion and not management's' type of quotes. If you can keep your kids seated during the end credits, there is a scene at the very end-I know, it might be hard to do. I was the only person-including my wife-that saw it in our theater. It's rated 'PG' for action and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. I would probably buy this one on Blu-Ray; the grandkids would like it.",7,0,0,7 December 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Seize the Moment
","I saw 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', starring Ben Stiller-The Watch, Mystery Men; Kristen Wiig-SNL-t.v., MacGruber; Adam Scott-Our Idiot Brother, Step Brothers; Shirley MacLaine-Valentine's Day, Cannonball Run 2 and Sean Penn-Gangster Squad, The Thin Red Line.This movie is based on the 1939 short story by James Thurber, about a man that leads a boring life. He gets through it by 'zoning out' or fantasizing that his life is much more interesting than it actually is. Ben, who also directs the film, plays Walter, a man that has an eHarmony account but no hits on it-his sponsor keeps calling to see if he has done anything interesting, so that he can put it on the site. Ben works in the photo development department at Life magazine and Sean plays his best photographer, that has just sent in his latest collection of photos. The only problem is that the best picture-according to Sean's attached message-is missing. Adam plays the bringer of bad news that Life magazine is going digital, and there will only be one more issue in print-using the recently acquired best picture from Sean-before the changeover to the computer age. After meeting a new office girl, Kristen, who encourages him to track down Sean and find the missing negative, Ben goes on a journey to Iceland, Greenland and Afghanistan- Sean does not have a cell phone and moves around a lot taking his photo masterpieces. Shirley plays Ben's mother. The 'zoning out' that Ben does is pretty good but it happens fewer times, as the movie continues-maybe because he is actually experiencing life and does not need to fantasize anymore. It's rated 'PG' for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",6,1,3,28 December 2013
The Lion King," Very Good CGI
","I saw 'The Lion King', starring the voices of Donald Glover-Atlanta_TV, Spider_Man:Homecoming; James Earl Jones-the Star Wars movies, The Meteor Man; Bey once Knowles_Carter-Obsessed, Austin Powers in Gold member and Chiclets Heretofore-Doctor Strange, Salt.
First of all, this movie has been referred to as a live action remake. That is not true. It is CGI. But, it is very good CGI. It looks great. It's directed by Jon Favreau, who recently directed the live action remake of the Jungle Book. The original Lion King was made in 1994-with a couple of sequels-and only one of the original actors from those movies shows up here. James Earl Jones. They do use the original songs, plus some new ones, too. As far as the story goes, it's basically the same. James/Mufasa is the king of the jungle and when he has Donald/Simba, he wants to train him as the future king. Chiwetel/Scar is James' brother, who has dreams of being king, but is frustrated with the birth of Donald, the new heir to the throne. Beyonce/Nala is the girlfriend and future queen of Donald. Chiwetel in his bid for the throne, plans bad things for his brother-James-and his nephew Donald. Like I said earlier, the CGI looks incredibly life like. If you are a fan of the original, you should enjoy this one. I myself, am not a big Disney fan-they are ok but not my favorite-whereas my wife loves them so I'm sure she will really like this one more than I did. I will be taking her to see it at a later date.
It's rated 'PG' for violence & peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.
It looked good and the story was good but it's not one that I would buy-except for the grandkids. It would be a good rental.",7,1,6,20 July 2019
A Quiet Place," An Interesting Premise
","I saw 'A Quiet Place', starring Emily Blunt-The Girl on the Train, Edge of Tomorrow; John Krasinski-The Office_tv, Dreamgirls; Millicent Simmonds-this is her second movie, with Wonderstruck being her first and Noah Jupe-Wonder, Suburbicon.
This is a sci-fi/horror movie, directed by John Krasinski-he is also starring in it, with his real life wife, Emily. It's also the first movie he has acted in with Emily-she plays his wife here, too. It's an interesting premise. It takes place about 20 years in the future, where an alien species has invaded the earth, and boy are they hungry. The gimmick here is that for some reason, the hungry aliens are blind. They hunt their human fast food by sound only. Any kind of noise attracts them. John and Emily live out in the woods, away from the city, where they go occasionally to get food and supplies. They communicate using sign language. Millicent and Noah are their children. FYI: Millicent is actually deaf. John is also an amateur inventor. He is working on a sonic device to use on the aliens, since their hearing is so acute. Then, to complicate matters, Emily goes and gets pregnant. I mean, how are you going to keep a baby quiet? The only problem I had was that I wish they had gone into more details about the aliens. Where were they from? How did they get here? What was their purpose coming here? Besides being hungry. Little things like that. But overall, I enjoyed it.
It's rated PG-13 for terror and bloody images and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.
I would buy it on DVD.",7,2,5,7 April 2018
22 Jump Street," Hilarious Sequel
","I saw '22 Jump Street', starring Jonah Hill-Django Unchained, Grandma's Boy; Channing Tatum-White House Down, She's the Man; Ice Cube-Ride Along, Anaconda; Peter Stormare-Pain & Gain, Nacho Libre and Wyatt Russell-This is 40, Cowboys & Aliens, and he is also the son of Kurt Russell & Goldie Hawn and the half brother to Oliver & Kate Hudson.This is a sequel to the 2012 movie, which is based on the 1987 t.v. series which starred Johnny Depp and, believe it or not, this installment is funnier than the first one. Jonah and Channing return as the two police officers that go undercover in schools because they happen to look young. In the first movie, they went to high school, but now, they are off to college. Ice returns as their foul-mouthed boss that runs the undercover operation and he has several funny scenes; one in particular is at a dinner get together where he looses his temper-for good reason. Wyatt plays a football player that is under suspicion at the college for being a drug dealer and Peter is the main bad guy that is trying to flood the college with his drugs. As far as the plot goes, there is not anything new here, but the actual funny comes from the execution of the material. For instance, there is a running joke about their ages involving several other students commenting on them being too old for college. There are several cameos-some from the original t,v, show-and during the end credits there are previews of the next ten to fifteen Jump Street movies-23 Jump, 24 Jump,etc. I-and most of the audience I was with-was laughing out loud, throughout the whole movie. It's rated 'R' for language, sexual content, violence and drug material and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. This was a hilarious sequel and I would definitely buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,6,14 June 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A Good Installment In The Franchise
","I saw 'Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales', starring Johnny Depp-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Into the Woods; Javier Bardem-The Counsellor, Collateral; Geoffrey Rush-Gods of Egypt, Mystery Men; Brenton Thwaites-Gods of Egypt, Oculus and Kaya Scodelario-The Maze Runner movies, The Truth About Emanuel.This is the 5th in the Pirates series and I must say, one of the better installments. It has Johnny returning as Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey as Barbossa and then some newbies to the franchise. Javier is the pirate hunting villain, Brenton is the son of Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightly- who both make small cameos-and Kaya is an adventurous young lady-who also has a family connection to another character but I won't spoil it for you here. In flashbacks, you get to see a young Johnny and why Javier is so obsessed with revenge on Johnny. The main plot involves everyone searching for the Trident of Poseidon, which is rumored to be able to break curses, among other things. The special effects are pretty amazing. Besides the ghosts-who look awesome-you have ghost sharks and ghost birds, too. If you remember from some of the previous movies, Keith Richards played Johnny's dad-However, he does not appear in this one. You do get to meet Johnny's uncle though, and he is played by another famous rock singer from around the same time period as Richards became famous-He is in heavy make-up but look for him in a jail scene when Johnny stops and talks to him as he is singing one of his songs. Make sure you stay until after the credits; there is a scene that could lead into the next movie. It's rated 'PG-13' for adventure violence and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes. I think this was a good installment in the series and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,0,6,26 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Good Story/Great Action
","I saw 'X-Men:Apocalypse', starring James McAvoy-Victor Frankenstein- Atonement; Michael Fassbender-Steve Jobs, Haywire; Jennifer Lawrence-The Hunger Games movies, Garden Party and Oscar Isaac-Star Wars:Episode 7_The Force awakens, All About the Benjamins.I think this is about the 6th X-Men movie and the 3rd directed by Bryan Singer, who also directed Days of Future Past, X-men 2 and X-men. James returns as Professor Xavier, as well as Michael as Magneto and Jennifer as Mystique. Oscar is the bad-ass villain and I do mean bad-ass, as he plays En Sabah Nur, aka Apocalypse. Oscar is purported to be the original mutant, from back in the ancient times of Egypt, where he would feed off of other mutants and even absorb their powers which would make him even stronger. After an incident with some non-believers, Oscar is buried in a pyramid for thousands of years, until he is unearthed in 1983. And he does not like what he sees. He decides to just destroy the whole world and start all over, with a little help from his 4 horsemen- kind of like mutant henchmen-paving the way. Since this is 1983 you get to see some of the mutants discover their abilities from the beginning, such as Storm, Cyclops and Nightcrawler. And of course Stan Lee makes his usual cameo; but this time, he has his real life wife standing beside him. There is another X-Men cameo but I'd rather not spoil it for you-you may have already heard about it but it's better as a surprise. There is also a scene after the end credits which has something to do with the aforementioned guest cameo above, so don't leave too soon. Bryan has said that this is the finale of his X-Men story arc but don't worry, there is already talk of more X-men-and X-Force-movies coming. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, destruction and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 24 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,10,19,27 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," An Amazing Sequel
","I saw 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2', starring Andrew Garfield-The Social Network, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus; Emma Stone-Gangster Squad, The House Bunny; Jamie Foxx-Django Unchained, Law Abiding Citizen; Dane DeHaan-Metallica Through the Never, Lincoln and Sally Field-Lincoln, Forrest Gump.This is an amazing second installment to the new Spider-Man trilogy-the third one is in the works. The Spider-Man character is now more like the comic books, both in storyline and just the fun one-liners that he zings at whoever is within listening distance, as he does his crime fighting or life saving duties. Andrew returns as Spidey and Emma is Gwen-FYI: the two actors started dating in real life and I think it makes their relationship look more realistic on screen. Sally also returns as Aunt May. Newcomers include Jamie as Electro, the main villain, and Dane as Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn. There is more story here , rather than just the big fights and explosions that are usual in these movies- although there are plenty of those, too. You get some back story on why Andrew's parents had to leave him with Sally during the first film. There are two major villains and one minor one-he has about 5 minutes of screen time-that are used in this film but there are a few subtle hints of future characters in the next movie. Some are character names, like Alister Smythe and Felicia Hardy-hint, hint-and some are glimpses of their costumes that are hanging in secluded labs. I know some comic book purists might get angry with the portrayal of certain things-Electro doesn't look like that, etc.-but they have sort of merged things from the regular Marvel Universe with the Marvel Ultimates-the same way they did it with Nick Fury now being a black man-so I wish they would quit gripping until they have at least seen the movie-then, they can gripe all they want. As far as the effects go, they are very good. When Spider-Man is swinging through the city, you might get a little dizzy if you are afraid of heights. I saw it in IMAX 3D and it looked great. There is a scene right after the end credits start that is basically an advertisement for the next X-Men movie-due in a couple of weeks-but no scene at the very end. It's rated 'PG-13' for the violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 22 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,6,2 May 2014
Ex Machina," Thinking Man's Sci-Fi
","I saw 'Ex Machina', starring Domhnall Gleeson-Unbroken, True Grit_2010, FYI: he is in the upcoming Star Wars 7; Oscar Isaac-The Bourne Legacy, Sucker Punch, FYI: he is in both the upcoming Star Wars 7 & X-Men:Age of Apocalypse and Alicia Vikander-Seventh Son, The Fifth Estate, FYI: she is in the upcoming Man From U.N.C.L.E.This is a sci-fi movie that leans more on the science fiction aspects and less on the action sequences that usually accompany a sci-fi movie. The title of the movie comes from the Latin phrase, 'Deus Ex-machina', which means, God From the Machine. Oh yeah, I have been told that it is actually pronounced with a hard 'k' sound, like 'Ex Ma-kina'. Anyway, Domhnall plays a computer programmer that works for Oscar, the CEO and creator of the world's largest search engine, Blue Book-it handles about 94% of the world's search traffic. Domhnall wins a company contest to spend a week at Oscar's remote, high security compound, where Oscar does all of his remote, high security work-you can only get there by helicopter. Domhnall is as giddy as a kid in a candy store when he is selected but when he arrives, he has to sign a waver that forbids him from talking about anything seen or worked on at the compound. He is still giddy, but just a little less so. Oscar then informs him that he has created A.I.-artificial intelligence-and wants Domhnall to help evaluate or test it. Alicia plays the A.I. and she looks part human-face, hands and feet-and part machine-all the rest. Domhnall & Alicia have sessions together, while Oscar watches from cameras but pretty soon, there are blackouts that occur under mysterious circumstances-Oscar can not see or hear them when they occur and during the blackouts, Alicia will tell Domhnall secrets that she does not want Oscar to hear. That is when it gets tricky; is Oscar behind the blackouts and he can still see & hear them? Or is Alicia trying to trick Domhnall into believing something false about Oscar? Or is Domhnall trying to trick everybody into believing it's Halloween? Well, not so much on that last one but you catch my drift. Lots of questions-and they are all answered. It's rated 'R' for language, violence and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes. This one will really make you think. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",7,3,8,25 April 2015
Grudge Match," Boxing Fan's Dream: Rocky vs Raging Bull
","I saw 'Grudge Match', starring Sylvester Stallone-The Expendables movies, the Rocky movies; Robert De Niro-Last Vegas, Raging Bull; Kim Basinger-Cellular, Never Say Never Again; Kevin Hart-This is the End, Soul Plane and Alan Arkin-Argo, Freebie and the Bean.This is a boxing fan's dream; Rocky Balboa vs Jake LaMotta, aka, The Raging Bull. Sylvester and Robert are basically playing their two iconic characters and show what might happen if they had a fight in their older years. They play boxers that had two matches against each other in the 1970's, each one winning a fight. The third tie-breaking match never happened for various reasons-which you do eventually discover. Kim plays a love interest that was involved with both of them, at one time, and had a child with one of them. Kevin plays the son of a boxing promoter that is now trying to coordinate the new match and Alan is Sylvester's old friend/trainer. There is comedy, with Kevin handling the majority of it, but there are also jabs at the Rocky and Raging Bull characters, especially in the training scenes. Also, at their advanced ages, each of the boxers have problems, anywhere from being blind in one eye to womanizing and having a drinking problem. For all of the UFC fans, there is a cameo of Chael Sonnen that is funny and there are a couple of scenes as the end credits start-nothing at the very end. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, language, and sexual content-no actual nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. If you are a fan of any of the actors or boxing, you will probably enjoy this one. I did and I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",7,9,16,25 December 2013
Hidden Figures," Amazing True Story
","I saw 'Hidden Figures', starring Taraji P. Henson-Empire_tv, The Karate Kid_2010; Octavia Spencer-Bad Santa 2, Mom_tv; Kevin Costner-Man of Steel, 3000 Miles to Graceland; Jim Parsons-Big Bang Theory_tv, School For Scoundrels and Kirsten Dunst-Fargo_tv, The Crow:Salvation.This is an amazing true story that takes place in the early 1960's. Taraji plays a math prodigy. Ever since she was a little girl she was good with numbers-she graduated high school at 14 & college at 18. She gets a job with her friend, Octavia, at the Virginia branch of NASA, but because of the times and the color of her skin and being a female-a triple wammy-they were segregated from the other workers. Kevin runs the division that calculates the math on space launches and sees Taraji's skills in action and puts her to work. Of course, others are not as enlightened as Kevin and are working under long held prejudices. Jim and Kirsten play sub bosses-next in line, down from Kevin-with Jim over Taraji and Kirsten over Octavia. This was all before computers so they used lots of blackboards, pens and papers to do their calculations. At the end of the movie, they show the real people the movie is based on and tell you what they accomplished. I don't think I would buy it on DVD-not for repeated viewings-but it would be a good rental. It's rated 'PG' for language and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes.",7,3,23,7 January 2017
Coco," Day of the Dead Celebration
","I saw 'Coco' starring the voices of Anthony Gonzalez-Criminal Minds:Beyond Borders_tv, The Bridge_tv; Gael Garcia Bernal-Mozart in the Jungle_tv, Desierto; Benjamin Bratt-Doctor Strange_2016, 24:Live Another Day_tv and Edward James Olmos-The Blade Runner movies, The Green Hornet_2011. This is an animated Pixar/Disney movie about the Mexican Day of the Dead, aka:Dia de los Muertos. They even use Mexican mariachi style music in the credits-beginning & end-when they show the Disney logo with the fireworks going off. The theater I was at was also showing it in both English & Spanish versions. Anyway, Anthony plays a little 10- 12 year old boy that loves music, both playing guitar and singing, just like his idol, Benjamin. But his whole family does not allow music in the house-because of a great great grandfather that was a traveling musician and left his family to pursue his career-and forbids Anthony to participate in any form. FYI: The title character of Coco, is the daughter of the a fore mentioned traveling musician, who is now Anthony's great grandmother. Anthony decides to borrow the guitar of Benjamin from his tomb-who died in an accident while he was on stage-but stealing from the dead sends Anthony to the land of the dead, where he meets Gael, an old friend of Benjamin, who promises to help Anthony find Benjamin in the afterlife. Edward is a character called Chicharron. The animation is really amazing, especially when they show the culture and traditions of the holiday. Some, I knew about-like the photos and mementos of the departed being displayed in little shrines-but others, I was unfamiliar with-like the animal spirit guides in the afterlife. There is a 21 minute short film called 'Olaf's Frozen Adventure' that is shown before the movie-I'm sure that it is just an early promotion for the next Frozen movie, but it was enjoyable-there are a couple of new songs in it. It's rated 'PG' for thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. Although it is definitely aimed at a Hispanic audience, you don't have to be Hispanic to enjoy it-I did. I would buy it on Blu-ray.",7,1,12,24 November 2017
1917," Visceral Look At War
","I saw '1917', starring George MacKay-Captain Fantastic, Peter Pan_2003; Dean_Charles Chapman-Blinded By the Light, Game of Thrones_tv; Richard Madden-Rocketman, Game of Thrones_tv and Colin Firth-the Mamma Mia! movies, the Kingsman movies.
This is a WW1 movie that is inspired by the director's grandfather's experiences, 'The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1879_1991'. Sam Mendes is the director and writer, who also directed Spectre, Skyfall and Road to Perdition. The film is shot and edited to make it look like it is one long shot that takes place in real time. It takes place in April of 1917 and follows two British soldiers, George & Dean, who are given an important mission: Get a message to fellow soldiers behind enemy lines that are about to launch an attack against German soldiers. If they fail to notify their fellow soldiers, the Germans will spring a trap on the Allies and over 1,600 men will be massacred, including Dean's brother, Richard. Colin is the General that gives George and Dean their orders and there are several cameos, including Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch. The action scenes look great and realistic as George and Dean make their way across enemy territory, determined to succeed in their mission. It is a visceral look at war.
It's rated 'R' for violence, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.
If you are a war movie fan, you will probably enjoy this one. I did and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",8,5,8,12 January 2020
Big Hero 6," Science Based Super Heroes
","I saw 'Big Hero 6', starring the voices of Ryan Potter-Senior Project, Supah Ninjas_t.v.; Scott Adsit-St. Vincent, We're the Millers; Maya Rudolph-Bridesmaids, SNL_t.v.; T.J. Miller-Transformers:Age of Extinction, Rock of Ages and Damon Wayans Jr.-New Girl_t.v., The Other Guys.This is the first Marvel animated movie to be released by the Disney studios-Disney owns Marvel, now. It's based on a Marvel comic book about computer nerds that become a super hero team called Big Hero 6. I have not read the books but you can tell the Japanese influences; It takes place in the not too distant future, mostly in a city called San Fransokyo-a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo-that has elevated trains and little flying blimps over the city, that look like those Japanese lanterns. Ryan plays a young genius that knows his robotics. His brother gives him a medical robot named Baymak-voiced by Scott-that looks like a big marshmallow. Maya plays their aunt that they live with. When a villain wearing a Kabuki mask comes to town, Ryan and some fellow nerds, including Damon and T.J., form a computer based super hero crime fighting group. They all have science to thank for their abilities and Baymak even gets some enhancements. The animation is good, as is the story and, as with most Marvel movies, you need to stay for the end credits, because there is a scene. There was a short Disney cartoon about a puppy before the movie began. There is a 3D version, which is the one I saw. It's rated 'PG' for action and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,19,7 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Should Satisfy Your Action Needs
","I saw 'Star Wars:The Last Jedi', starring Mark Hamill-Kingsman:The Secret Service, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back; Carrie Fisher-Charlies' Angels:Full Throttle, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back; Adam Driver-Logan Lucky, Midnight Special; Daisy Ridley-Murder On the Orient Express_2017, Star Wars:The Force Awakens and Andy Serkis-The Planet of the Apes movies, 13 Going on 30.This is the second, or middle, of the third trilogy-or episode eight-that follows the 2015 Star Wars:The Force Awakens. This is also Carrie's last film appearance-she died last December-and there are no CGI enhancements of her here. It is all really her on screen. They also continue the grand tradition of the opening scrawl catching you up on what is going on. It picks up right where the last installment ended, with Carrie/Leia leading her defiant rebel resistance fighters in a retreat from the evil First Order and Daisy/Rey just finally tracking down Mark/Luke, trying to get him to help in their fight. She also wants him to train her in the use of the Force. Adam/Ben/Kylo is getting a performance review by his boss, Andy/Snoke, about his lack of winning-this frustration causes Adam to get rid of his helmet. There is a connection between Daisy and Adam; they each want to turn the other one to their side. There are also some deaths of characters, both good guys & bad guys, and a few good cameos-I remember seeing Benicio del Toro and Justin Theroux pop up. There is a new cute animal, a Porg, and there is a fantastic, hold on to your seat, lightsaber fight in Andy's headquarters. It should satisfy your action needs for a while. The only problem that I had was the way they would jump from scene to scene, back and forth, just when something was getting good. I know, it was supposed to be showing how things were happening simultaneously, but I wished sometimes that they would stay with one scene a little longer before jumping to the next one.
It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 32 minutes.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,12,36,16 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Great New Franchise
","I saw 'Guardians of the Galaxy', starring Chris Pratt-Parks and Recreation_t.v., Wanted; Zoe Saldana-Columbiana, Avatar; Dave Bautista- Riddick, The Man With the Iron Fists; the voice of Vin Diesel-the Fast & the Furious movies, Saving Private Ryan and the voice of Bradley Cooper- the Hangover movies, Alias_t.v.This is the start of a new franchise for Marvel Comics. It's based on a lesser-known book that was started in the 1960's, got canceled and then re-launched over the years. This movie is based on the 2008 version of the books. The story starts in 1988, when a little boy named Peter Quill loses his mother to cancer and is then abducted and raised by aliens. Chris plays the older version of Peter, or as he becomes known as, Starlord. Chris has become a thief and is after a mysterious orb that several other people are also after. Zoe-Gamora-is one of those other people and she is also the adopted daughter of Thanos-remember him from the end credits of the Avengers? Vin voices Groot, a sort of living tree with a very limited vocabulary-'I am Groot' is all that he ever says-and Bradley voices Rocket, a highly intelligent raccoon that has been surgically altered with cybernetics and can also talk. Thanos hires Ronan the Accuser to also go after the orb after Zoe fails in her attempt and the newly forming Guardians run into their latest member Dave-Drax-who has a need to kill Ronan for his own personal reasons. The Collector from the end credits of Thor makes an appearance, too. Chris uses a cassette Walkman to play music-there is a reason he uses it, instead of some more modern device-and there is a lot of 1970's & 1980's songs heard throughout the film. Stan Lee does make his cameo as well as a few others. I saw the IMAX 3D version and it was well worth it. The effects are great, the story is good, the actors look the parts and there is plenty of humor, along with the action-the whole vibe sort of reminded me of the old t.v. show called Firefly. There is a scene just as the end credits start, plus another scene after the end credits-and the second one involves a different Marvel character that had his own movie, back in the 1980's. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. This is a good origin story and I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,4,1 August 2014
Evil Dead," Bloody good remake
","This is a remake or reboot of the 1981 classic Bruce Campbell 'Evil Dead'. Sam Raimi was the original's director-here , he has a writing & producing credit . For those unfamiliar with the original , five young people are at a cabin in the woods and are attacked by a Demon that wants to possess them . Jane is a heroin addict that has been brought out to the woods to help kick her habit, a remote place to go cold turkey . Shiloh is her brother , Elizabeth is his girlfriend , Lou is an aspiring teacher and Jessica is a nurse-in-training . They come across the Book of the Dead-just the title alone should have warned them-and evil is soon unleashed. Of course , when Jane tells them that she is seeing things , they think she is just in the stages of withdrawal . I thought it was a good remake-enough familiar elements with some new ones thrown in , for good measure . FYI: If you stay until after the credits , you will be rewarded . It is rated 'R' for violence-It is extremely graphic in the violence ; one person cuts off her own arm with a carving knife , so don't bring any kiddies to this one , sexual content and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes .

The Imitation Game," Origin of the Computer
","I saw 'The Imitation Game', Benedict Cumberbatch-August:Osage County, Star Trek Into Darkness; Keira Knightley-Jack Ryan:Shadow recruit, Star Wars:Episode 1-The Phantom Menace; Matthew Goode-Leap Year, Watchmen and Mark Strong-Zero Dark Thirty, Green Lantern.This movie is based on a true story, in fact it has remained a secret for 50 years. It is the story of how an English mathematician was instrumental in shortening WW2 and also inventing our modern day computers. Benedict plays Alan Turing, the brilliant but quirky genius that was enlisted with a few others to crack the German's enigma code. The Germans used what they called the enigma machine-about the size of a typewriter-to communicate their battle plans with each other and the codes were changed every day at midnight. So if the code was not broken by midnight, they would have to start all over the next day. The enigma code had about 159 trillion-that is 159 followed by 18 zeros-different possible combinations and with the time limit, it was pretty well impossible to do. That is, until Benedict decided that he needed a machine to calculate the different possibilities at light speed, and bam, the computer is born-a lot bigger than what you could hold in your hand but it worked. Keira and Matthew were other members on the crack team of code breakers and Mark is the head of the British Secret Service organization called MI6. Alan Turing was not a very likable person; he was brilliant, which made him egotistical but he did not understand how to interact with people-for instance, he did not understand the basics of a joke. He was also a closeted homosexual, which was a big taboo at that time-1950's-in England. In fact, homosexuals were arrested for gross indecency.The movie also jumps back and forth through 3 different time periods, the 1930's, the 1940's and the 1950's, covering his earlier childhood-1930's-the war years-1940's-and his later days-1950's. It's rated 'PG-13' for sexual references and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I thought it was an interesting story and I would buy it on DVD.",7,0,3,1 January 2015
Jurassic World," Dino-West World
","I saw 'Jurassic World', starring Chris Pratt-Guardians of the Galaxy, Jennifer's Body; Bryce Dallas Howard-The Help, The Village, Oh Yeah, she is Ron Howard's daughter; Vincent D'Onofrio-Daredevil_tv, The Cell; Judy Greer-Entourage, The Village and BD Wong-Oz_tv, Jurassic Park.There have been 3 previous Jurassic Park movies-1993, 1997 & 2001-and this one is a sequel to the 1993 original, at least that is what the director Colin Trevorrow says. This movie is produced by Steven Spielberg, who had a hand in the previous entries. Jurassic World is a functioning dinosaur amusement park and has been running for about 10 years. Bryce is in charge of public relations and gives tours to heads of corporations that may be future investors-Hey, it takes money to run the park. There are dino petting zoos, holograms and gyrospheres that look like a giant hamster ball that lets tourist see dinosaurs up close. There are even tracking devices implanted in the dinosaurs so they know where every animal is, at any given time. Chris plays a sort of dino-whisperer; he has a limited control over 4 velociraptors that he has practically raised since birth. Vincent has his own ideas about the trained dinosaurs, such as weaponizing them to use in the Middle East. Judy plays Bryce's sister that decides to send her 2 sons on a vacation to Jurassic World-hey, her sister works there, how dangerous could it be? BD plays a scientist-FYI, he is the only actor that was in the original movie that is in this installment. After 10 years, the attendance has dropped a little and needs some fresh blood, so to speak-whenever a new attraction is added, attendance spikes. Some one even says that what they really need is something bigger with more teeth. BD gets right on the job and starts splicing genes and creates a brand new dinosaur called Indominus Rex. This new hybrid has features from various creatures that make it highly intelligent; it can change colors for camouflage and even elude heat sensors. Now, what could possibly go wrong with any of that? How about dinosaur chaos with rampaging animals on an island full of tourist? There are a few nods or references to the earlier movies for sharp eyed fans. I have been asked if it is suitable for kids-it is 'PG-13'-and I guess it depends on the kids, because there is a lot of people and other animals that get killed by Indominus Rex. This movie reminded me a little bit like West World; another amusement park that has gone crazy. It's rated 'PG-13' for the violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,7,21,12 June 2015
Prisoners," Edge-of-the-Seat Thriller
","I saw 'Prisoners', starring Hugh Jackman-Les Miserables-2012, Van Helsing; Jake Gyllenhaal-End of Watch, Brokeback Mountain; Terrence Howard-Red Tails, Big Momma's House; Maria Bello-Grown Ups, Coyote Ugly and Paul Dano-Cowboys & Aliens, There Will Be Blood.This is a tense edge-of-the-seat thriller with some hidden surprises. Hugh and Maria are visiting their neighbors during the Thanksgiving holidays when something happens that every parent dreads. Their six year old daughter and the daughter of their friend Terrence disappear. After searching everywhere, the only clue is a suspicious looking RV that was seen in the neighborhood. The police are called in and Jake is the head detective; he has a reputation for solving all of his cases. Paul is spotted in the RV and arrested but no physical evidence is found of the missing girls. With no evidence, Paul is released which does not sit well with Hugh, who decides to take matters into his own hands. The question of how far a father would go to get his daughter back is explored and then you have the idea of whether Paul is even the right guy or not. Paul has a stunted mental capacity of a ten year old, and there are other suspects, so questions are raised. I thought it was also realistically portrayed how some people will turn to drinking or drug use to cope with the stress of a missing child. FYI: There is a scene, during an interrogation, that I could have sworn a policeman calls Jake by his real name-it was something like,'Let me know if you find out anything, Gyllenhaal.' Anyway, I enjoyed the movie but the ending was kind of off; It was kind of abrupt, as if they were trying to wrap it up. It is rated 'R' for violence-including scenes of torture, language and drug/alcohol use and has a running time of 2 hours & 33 minutes. It was a nice thriller but I don't think that I would buy it on DVD-once was enough. It would be a good rental, though.",7,2,4,20 September 2013
Logan," Good/Bad
","I saw 'Logan', starring Hugh Jackman-Eddie the Eagle, Swordfish; Patrick Stewart-Blunt Talk_tv, Robin Hood:Men in Tights; Boyd Holbrook-Morgan, Gone Girl and Dafne Keen-This is her first movie but she was in a Spanish/BBC TV series called The Refugees.This is one of those good things/bad things. It's good because it's a really good movie-they got it right by going with an 'R' rating-and it's bad because this is Hugh's & Patrick's last times to play these characters-at least, that's what both actors have said in interviews. The movie takes place in the not too distant future where Hugh is older, has more aches & pains, even walks with a limp and his healing factor takes longer to work. Most mutants are either dead or have gone into hiding. Hugh himself is hiding out near El Paso, down close to the Mexican border. He and another mutant, Caliban, are taking care of Patrick, who is fighting dementia by taking pills-if he doesn't take them, he will lash out uncontrollably with paralyzing waves of mental energy that hits anyone in close proximity. Hugh has just about given up on everything. He just wants to buy a boat and live on the ocean. About then is when Dafne shows up, looking for help. A group of cyborg enhanced mercenaries called The Reavers are after her. Boyd is their leader, and all Dafne wants to do is get to North Dakota, a safe haven for mutants. If you are familiar with the comics, you probably know the connection between Hugh & Dafne, aka X-23. The fights are fantastic but be cautious of taking little kids. Heads & other body parts are dismembered by both Hugh and Dafne with ease and there is lots of language flying around-It is hilarious to here Patrick use the F-bomb. Oh yeah, make sure you are not late to the theater. There is not a scene at the end of the movie but there is one at the very beginning. It involves another super hero, basically plugging his own up-coming movie- no date is mentioned, it just says coming soon. It's rated 'R' for strong brutal violence, language and some brief nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes. I loved this one-I wish there would be more 'R' rated super hero movies- and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,4,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Great Action-Packed Sequel
","I saw 'Avengers:Age of Ultron', starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson- Godzilla_2014, the Kick-Ass movies; Elizabeth Olsen-Godzilla_2014, Oldboy; Paul Bettany-Priest, The Da Vinci Code and the voice of James Spader-The Blacklist_tv, Boston Legal_tv.This is the second Avengers movie, following the 2012 inauguration, and with more to follow. All of the original members are reunited and there are some new faces, on both the good and the bad sides. Aaron plays Quicksilver and Elizabeth is his sister, the Scarlet Witch. James voices the villain, Ultron while Paul, who has previously voiced Jarvis, is now the Vision. Like most movie adaptations, there are differences here from the books. No mention of the Magneto connection to Aaron & Elizabeth-here they were created by Hydra experiments. Hank Pym created Ultron-in the books-but here he is created by Tony Stark. As long as the story is good, I don't think some changes here and there are that big of a deal; I just consider it is taking place in an alternate universe from the books. Anyway, basically James wants to eliminate the human species and the Avengers want to stop him. Aaron and Elizabeth are taken in by James, at first, but soon see the error of their ways and decide to switch sides to become card carrying members of the Avengers. One of the things that I enjoyed-besides the usual fisticuffs and super heroic action packed battle scenes- was the equal time that the characters had spent on their private lives. One of the Avengers was even shown to have a family, including a wife and kids. Don't get me wrong, the super hero action is fantastic, with some great battles of heroes vs other heroes, as well as heroes vs the bad guys and there is lots of humorous dialogue, to keep things from becoming too dark. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo appearance, as well as a few heroes from earlier movies. There is a death of an Avenger-and it does look like it is supposed to be permanent, but who knows. There is a scene as the end credits start- involving the Infinity gems-but the only thing at the very end is a little note that says, 'The Avengers Will Return.' It's rated 'PG-13' for violence & destruction, sci-fi action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes. I think this one is a worthy sequel and is in fact, better than the first one. I would definitely buy this one on Blu-Ray.",9,1,7,1 May 2015
Everest," Breathtaking, Made For IMAX
","I saw 'Everest', starring Jason Clarke-Terminator Genisys, White House Down; Josh Brolin-Guardians of the Galaxy, Planet Terror; Keira Knightley-The Imitation Game, Domino; Michael Kelly-Man of Steel, Law Abiding Citizen and Jake Gyllenhaal-Southpaw, Jarhead.This is based on a true story. It's based on the book 'Into Thin Air', by Jon Krakaver, a reporter that went on the tragic climb. Everest is the world's tallest mountain, situated in Nepal. The story takes place in 1996, when lots of teams of climbers were making the treacherous climb, sometimes bumping into other teams or having to wait to cross a gorge. They also did it for different reasons; some, just to say they did it, others because it was a challenge. They were usually led by seasoned guides, such as Jason and Jake. Jason was always careful because he was married to Keira-if I was married to her, I don't think I would be climbing mountains-and she was expecting their first child, so he had something to come home to. Jake was careful but he also had a wild side to him where sometimes, he would tend to take chances. Michael plays Jon Krakaver, the reporter that wrote the book that the movie is based on and Josh is a Texan millionaire that is along for the kicks of climbing and just getting out of his boring home life. The shots of the mountains are breathtaking and made for viewing in IMAX-I saw it in IMAX 3D. The climb is very dangerous for beginners because of the weather and lack of oxygen-near the top is as high as the cruising altitude of a 747 airplane-so they have to carry extra oxygen tanks to use, not to mention the freezing temperatures. If you are not a professional climber, you might as well stay home. Not all of the climbers make it back alive and some of the ones that do have physical problems-one guy lost both hands and his nose to the cold temperatures and at one point, he was given up for dead before he came staggering into the base camp. It's rated 'PG-13' for intense peril and disturbing images and has a running time of 2 hours and 1 minute. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental.",6,0,0,23 September 2015
Midsommar," Trippy Little Movie
","I saw 'Midsommar', starring Florence Pugh-Fighting With My Family, The Commuter; Jack Reynor-On the Basis of Sex, Transformers:Age of Extinction; William Jackson Harper-The Good Place_tv, All Good Things and Will Poulter-The Revenant, We're the Millers.
This is a trippy little movie that is written and directed by Ari Aster, the man who directed the 2018 Hereditary. I say trippy because there are some drugs administered and lots of hallucinatory nightmares popping up. Florence and Jack are in a relationship-dating about 4 years now-but things are a little strained. Florence has just lost her parents and sister and is real depressed. William and Will are Jack's friends that are planning a trip to Sweden with a Swedish foreign exchange student they recently met and they all think that it would help Florence get over her personal problems if she tagged along. Their Swedish friend takes them to his community where they are in the process of celebrating their mid_summer festival-they do it every 90 years-and wants them to even participate in some of their pagan rituals....I mean, activities. Jack and William also want to write their college thesis on the village. They soon find out that there is more going on than they had anticipated. I guess none of them have ever seen the movie Hostel.
It's rated 'R' for disturbing ritualistic violence, grisly images, drug use, language and sexual content-including both male & female nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 27 minutes.
I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental, if you are not too squeamish about bodily fluids.",6,2,4,7 July 2019
Elysium," 1%ers vs 99%ers
","I saw 'Elysium', starring Matt Damon-The Bourne movies, Chasing Amy; Jodie Foster-Panic Room, Taxi Driver; Sharlto Copley-The A Team-2010, District 9 and Alice Braga-Predators, I Am Legend.This is a sci-fi action movie that is directed by Neill Blomkamp, whose first movie was 'District 9'-this is his second film. It takes place in the year 2154, where Earth is over populated and diseased, at least 99% of the population, anyway. The 1%, who just happen to be rich, live on an orbiting space station called Elysium, where diseases can be cured instantly and they live in mansions. Jodie is the Defense Secretary of Elysium, second in control after the President. Matt, who lives on Earth with all the other poor people who can't afford good health insurance-Hey, that sounds like it could be straight out of the headlines of what is going on right now-gets hurt on his job and only has five days to live. His only chance is to get up to Elysium and get a cure but Jodie has a habit of shooting down any unauthorized ships-she doesn't seem to like the poor illegals that are only trying to get their share of the pie. Alice is a childhood girlfriend of Matt's that also has a reason to get to Elysium and Sharlto plays an off the books enforcer for Jodie; you know, doing all the dirty clean up jobs that Jodie doesn't want the President to find out about. It's rated 'R' for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. I did not like the ending, but I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",7,3,9,9 August 2013
Selma," Slice of History
","I saw 'Selma', starring David Oyelowo-Interstellar, Jack Reacher; Carmen Ejogo-The Purge:Anarchy, Alex Cross; Tom Wilkinson-The Lone Ranger_2013, The Green Hornet_2011 and Tim Roth-The Incredible Hulk_2008, Pulp Fiction.This is not really an autobiography about the life of Martin Luther King Jr. but it does cover an important slice of his life. David plays the reverend MLK jr, who, among other things, led a crusade to get voting rights for African-Americans in 1965. The title of the movie refers to the southern town of Selma, Alabama where the historic battle began, and the journey ended up in Montgomery, Alabama. Carmen plays David's wife, Coretta. Tom plays the president-LBJ-and Tim plays governor George Wallace. For those uninformed about the time period, it was pretty bad for anyone with dark skin. Blacks were not treated equally, especially in the south, even though legally, they were supposed to be. David pleaded with Tom for changes in legislation but it was slow in coming-it just was not a high priority. The marches and demonstrations which David led were peaceful and non-violent, at least on their part. It took being shown some of the atrocities on the nightly news before a lot of eyes were opened for the rest of the country. Oprah Winfrey was a producer of the film and she also has a small role in it. If you are interested in the subject matter, it is an eye-opener. I'm old enough to remember watching a lot of it on TV, as it was happening. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and language-the N word is used a lot- and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was enough-but it would be alright as a rental.",6,5,13,9 January 2015
Snowden," Interesting, If True
","I saw 'Snowden', Joseph Gordon-Levitt-The Walk, Halloween H20:20 Years Later; Zachary Quinto-Spock in the new Star Trek movies, American Horror Story_tv; Shailene Woodley-The Divergent movies, The Secret Life of the American Teenager_tv and Rhys Ifans-Alice Through the Looking Glass, Elementary_tv.This is based on the true story about Ed Snowden, who leaked secrets to the press that he had taken while working for the NSA. You might have heard a little about it. He is living in Russia now, trying to avoid treason charges from America. There was never any doubt about what he did. The hitch is that the NSA, C.I.A.-and a lot of other agencies with initials-say that it is treason to leak sensitive, top secret info to the public, but the info that he leaked was that these agencies were spying on people, using their cell phones and personal computers- including American citizens-without there knowledge. It is known in some circles as illegal surveillance techniques. Joseph plays Snowden, Shailene plays his girlfriend, Zachary plays a reporter that helps break the story and Rhys plays one of Joseph's teachers in his C.I.A. training classes. The story covers 2004 through 2013, beginning with Joseph in basic training as a soldier. After an accident he joins the C.I.A. as a computer analyst-he had a high I.Q.-and then works his way through to the NSA. This is all kind of amazing since he dropped out of high school-because of financial reasons-and basically taught himself everything. It's directed by Oliver Stone, who has a reputation as a conspiracy enthusiast-so this is an interesting story, if it is all true. There are several good cameos; I remember seeing Timothy Olyphant, Scott Eastwood and Nicolas Cage in small but memorable roles. At the end of the movie the actual Snowden is shown in interview footage. It's rated 'R' for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. I wouldn't buy it on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a great rental.",7,0,7,17 September 2016
Don't Breathe," A Dilemma/Who To Root For?
","I saw 'Don't Breathe', starring Stephen Lang-Avatar, Tombstone; Jane Levy-Evil Dead_2013, Suburgatory_tv; Dylan Minnette-Goosebumps, Let Me In and Daniel Zovatto-Fear The Walking Dead_tv, It Follows.This is not your typical thriller/horror movie. It has twists that might catch you off guard-it did me-and you are not really sure who you should be rooting for as the good guy or the bad guy. Stephen is a Gulf War vet that was blinded in battle. After coming home to the states, his daughter is killed by a drunk rich girl-who gets off with no jail time, since she is rich-but he does get a large settlement from the rich parents. Jane, Dylan and Daniel are a group of teens that spend their spare time burglarizing houses and taking whatever they want. You see, Dylan's father works for a home security company so Dylan has access to keys and codes. They hear about Stephen's little windfall and decide to hit him, thinking, what trouble can a blind man be? Plus, the house is in a bad, rundown neighborhood with few neighbors. Boy, are they wrong. It seems that old Stephen might just have a few tricks-as well as secrets-up his sleeve. Concerning what I mentioned earlier about who to root for, do you hope the kids rob a blind war vet or do you hope a physically fit war vet with Daredevil type senses defends his property? But then, what if the war vet takes things too far? Is it justified? It is a dilemma. It's rated 'R' for violence, terror, disturbing content, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,6,14,27 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," If You Liked The Original....
","I saw 'Beauty and the Beast', starring Emma Watson-My Week With Marilyn, the Harry Potter movies; Dan Stevens-Legion_tv, Downton Abbey_tv; Luke Evans-The Girl on the Train, Fast & Furious 6; Josh Gad-Pixels, Love & Other Drugs and Kevin Kline-Ricki and the Flash.This is a live-action remake of the classic 1991 Disney film, which was in turn, based on a French fairy tale. If you have fond memories of that 1991 story then you should enjoy this version. It is a musical so it contains new versions of those loved songs from the original, plus it has a few new songs, too. The story is pretty much the same-don't judge a book by it's cover-but it is also filled out more. For instance, in the original, the origin of the Beast is told in narration at the beginning of the movie, but here, it is actually shown. Emma plays Belle, Kevin is her father Maurice, Dan is the Beast, Luke is Gaston and Josh is his faithful sidekick LeFou. Oh, I should mention that before the movie was even released, there was all kinds of talk about there being a gay character in the movie and people being upset about it-I even heard some people were going to boycott the movie. It's all ridiculous. The character in question is Josh/LeFou and things are only hinted at that he likes Luke/Gaston. Nothing ever happens between the two in any sort of gay fashion so you can relax. These rumors are usually started by people that haven't even seen the movie in the first place-which irritates me to no end. Anyway, like I said earlier, if you liked the original, then you will probably like this one, too. It's rated 'PG' for action violence, peril and frightening images and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",7,0,7,17 March 2017
Sicario," Drug War Thriller
","I saw 'Sicario', starring Emily Blunt-Into the Woods, The Wolfman_2010; Benicio Del Toro-Guardians of the Galaxy, The Wolfman_2010; Josh Brolin- Guardians of the Galaxy, Milk and Victor Garber-The Flash_tv, Milk.This is a nice little thriller about the drug war between the good old U. S. of A. and Mexico. Emily plays an FBI agent working out of Arizona. On her latest case, a drug lord on his way back to Juarez Mexico, leaves a nasty explosive present behind and several agents are killed. When Josh-a CIA agent-and Benicio-a mysterious Mexican collaborator-ask for Emily's help in tracking down the bad drug lord, she doesn't hesitate in trying to get herself a little revenge. Victor plays Emily's boss that lets her go, thinking she might learn something from the CIA, but it turns out to be just the opposite. Josh and Benicio keep her in the dark about almost everything that is going on. They let her know just enough to keep her confused about things. Emily soon learns that it is hard to trust anyone involved in the drug business-both good guys and bad guys- Can you believe it? Some of the good guys are bought off by drug money! FYI: Sicario is Spanish for Hit-man. It's rated 'R' for violence, grisly images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",7,1,3,2 October 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Daddy Issues
","I saw 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2', starring Chris Pratt-Passengers, Jennifer's Body; Zoe Saldana-Columbiana, The Terminal; Dave Bautista- Spectre, Riddick; Kurt Russell-the Fast & the Furious movies, Vanilla Sky; the voice of Bradley Cooper-War Dogs, The Midnight Meat Train and the voice of Vin Diesel-the Fast & the Furious movies, The Pacifier.This is a sequel to the 2014 comic book movie of the same name-except for the Vol. 2 part-and it carries on in fine form; In fact, I think it's better than the first one-And I really liked the original. It's directed by the same director as the first one, James Gunn and I guess the theme here is Daddy Issues. Chris/Peter Quill/Star-Lord finds out about his biological father, Kurt/Ego-FYI: Any comic book nerds, like myself, will know about the celestial Ego. Zoe/Gamora and her sister both have issues with their father, Thanos, who does not make an appearance here, but he is talked about quite often. Of course, Dave/Drax is hilarious in his interpretation of situations and Bradley/Rocket & Vin/Baby Groot are as delightful to watch as always. I enjoyed the music; still full of familiar classic rock songs and this movie is just filled with cameos-I'll only give you one here, Sylvester Stallone and no, there is not a Tango & Cash reunion. Some of the cameos you will spot right away but I always read the end credits and I saw some that you might miss-some are in group scenes and some just do voices. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo, not once, but twice and Oh yeah, the end credits has 5 scenes! 4 during the end credits and 1 at the very end, so make sure you stay for all of them. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi action and violence, language and sexual situations-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 16 minutes. I definitely enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,1,5,5 May 2017
The Shape of Water," Sci-Fi Romance
","I saw 'The Shape of Water', starring Sally Hawkins-Paddington, Godzilla_2014; Michael Shannon-Nocturnal Animals, Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice; Richard Jenkins-Kong:Skull Island, Step Brothers and Octavia Spencer-Hidden Figures, Snowpiercer.
This is a sci-fi romantic movie that is written & directed by Guillermo del Toro-Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy. It's set in the 1960's when the cold war was going full speed. Sally is a mute janitor-she can hear but not speak-that works at a research facility with Octavia. Michael is a man that captured an aquatic creature in the jungles of the Amazon and has brought it to the facility to have it researched. FYI: The creature looks kind of like the creature from the black lagoon, only more detailed. Michael wants to dissect the creature and find out what makes him tick. Sally befriends the creature-she even teaches it sign language-and wants to save it so she enlists her neighbor and close friend, Richard, along with her co-worker, Octavia to pull off an Ocean's Eleven. There is also a side-plot about the Russians wanting to get their hands on the creature, too-remember, it's the cold war. The creature looks great-he reminded me of Abe Sapien from Hellboy and in fact, the same actor played both parts, Doug Jones-but the story just didn't cut the mustard with me. I could have used more action and less romance.
It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes.
It's not one that I'd buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",6,3,8,23 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," Fills In The Background
","I saw 'The Disaster Artist', starring James Franco-The Interview, General Hospital_tv; Dave Franco-The Now You See Me movies, Warm Bodies; Ari Graynor-Bad Teacher_tv, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist and Seth Rogen-The Neighbors movies, Zack and Miri Make a Porno. This is a movie that shows how another movie-The Room-got made. If you have never seen The Room-a 2003 cult movie-I highly recommend you watch it before you see The Disaster Artist and you will enjoy it even more. If you haven't seen it, you can still enjoy this one, but it's just better otherwise. James plays Tommy Wiseau, the eccentric-and that is putting it mildly-actor that meets Dave, playing Greg Sestero, another more normal actor and they become fast friends. Both are struggling to find work and finally decide to just make their own movie, with James/Tommy writing, producing, directing and starring and Dave/Greg co-starring. FYI: This is the first time that James & Dave have made a movie together. When I said James/Tommy was eccentric, besides his acting being over the top, he was very mysterious about himself. When asked where he was from, he would say, New Orleans, and you could tell from his accent that he was European-I later learned it was Poland. He was also evasive about his age-he looked to be in his 40's but said he was in his 20's. He had lots of money but no discernible income-my guess would be inherited. He would laugh at inappropriate moments for no reason. Ari plays the love interest in the movie and Seth is a script consultant. There are lots of cameos, both of James' real life buddies and other actors-I remember seeing Melanie Griffith, Alison Brie, Sharon Stone, Zac Effron and Bryan Cranston-and James directs this movie, which is based on a book written by the real Greg Sestero. Tommy & Greg both make cameos. As the end credits start, they divide the screen, showing scenes of both movies, side by side. And make sure that you stay after the end credits for an extra scene-you won't be disappointed. The movie fills in the background of The Room and how it came to be. It's rated 'R' for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",8,5,11,8 December 2017
American Made," Entertaining Story
","I saw 'American Made', starring Tom Cruise-Edge of Tomorrow, Legend; Domhnall Gleeson-Mother!, Star Wars:The Force Awakens; Sarah Wright- Parks and Recreation_tv, The House Bunny and Caleb Landry Jones-Get Out, X-Men:First Class. This is based on a true story about an airline pilot that got enlisted into working for the C.I.A. and making more money than he could even keep track of. It takes place in the 1980's, when Nancy Reagan was on the television talking about drugs and telling people that they should just say no. Tom plays Barry Seal, a pilot that gets roped into the smuggling business by Domhnall, a C.I.A. operative. At first, Tom is to take surveillance photos of communist militia down in South America but pretty soon, he finds himself flying drugs and guns and even people. The money starts piling up and he has problems just keeping it all straight-there is a scene where his wife, Sarah, tells him that the dog dug up a bag of money in the backyard and the money is flying all over the yard. Tom says that he will rake it up in the morning. Caleb plays Sarah's irresponsible brother that is a real red neck looser-no job, dates 15 year old girls and likes to live beyond his means. Pretty soon, Tom has the DEA, the F.B.I., the ATF and even the State Police on his tail, trying to put him in jail. The story is told by Tom as he makes a sort of diary on VHS tapes-it was the 80's, remember. It is an interesting and entertaining story. It's rated 'R' for language and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD-one viewing was fine-but it would be a good rental.",7,2,5,29 September 2017
The Witch," Not Scary, Slow Paced and Just Plain Weird
","I saw 'The Witch', starring Anya Taylor-Joy-Atlantis_tv, Vampire Academy; Ralph Ineson-Guardians of the Galaxy, Game of Thrones_tv; Kate Dickie-Game of Thrones_tv, Prometheus and Bathsheba Garnett-P2, Mean Girls.I heard a little bit about this movie, before I saw it; that it was a small budget independent horror film with some really good scares. Not so. It's not very scary at all, more on the weird side than anything and it is very slow paced. Ralph and Kate are the devout Christians in 1630's New England that are forced to leave the colonial American settlement they have been living in with their 5 kids-I did not really understand the reason why they had to leave-and find a new home, away from everyone. After building a new house in the middle of nowhere, Ralph and Kate let Anya, the oldest daughter of the 5 kids, watch her baby brother in a clearing near the edge of the forest. Unbeknown to the family, Bathsheba is their neighbor and she performs strange black magic witchcraft during the night. Her latest ritual calls for a baby and Bathsheba decides it won't be a big deal if she was to just pop over and borrow a cup of baby. That is when the whole family starts acting strange and accusing each other of being witches, their animals start acting weird and their crops suddenly go bad. I read that the director used real transcripts from this time period to make the dialogue sound authentic but I had problems sometimes just understanding them, you know, with the thick English accents. As far as the set pieces and the look of the movie itself, they did do a good job on that. It's rated 'R' for violence and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I would not rent it on DVD, either, if I were you. If you really want to see it, you should wait until it comes to cable.",4,5,15,19 February 2016
Jersey Boys," Good Story, Good Music
","I saw 'Jersey Boys', starring John Lloyd Young-this is his first movie but he did play Frankie Valli on Broadway; Vincent Piazza-The Sopranos_t.v., Boardwalk Empire_t.v.; Erich Bergen-How Sweet It Is, Gossip Girl_t.v. and Christopher Walken-Balls of Fury, Joe Dirt.This is an autobiographical movie that is based on a Tony Award winning Broadway musical and it is directed by Clint Eastwood. It is the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, a pop music group that had more than a few hits during their career. It starts in 1951 New Jersey, with John as a teenaged want-a-bee singer. His friend, Vincent, had a band that needed a singer, but the only problem was that Vincent was in and out of trouble a lot. When Vincent was not playing music, he worked for a mob boss, Christopher, so Vincent spent his share of time in jail. Erich was a song writer that later joined the band and helped boost their popularity. I thought it was interesting how they would show how a song came together. If you are a fan of their music, then you should enjoy this movie-I am and I did. If you are unfamiliar with them, Frankie Valli had a rather distinctive voice for the musical groups of that time; it was a falsetto voice. It's rated 'R' for language and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. I enjoyed the music and the story and I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",7,17,27,20 June 2014
12 Years a Slave," Uncomfortable Period of History
","I saw '12 Years a Slave', starring Chiwetel Ejiofor-Salt, Serenity; Benedict Cumberbatch-Star Trek Into Darkness, War Horse; Michael Fassbender-Prometheus, Jonah Hex and Sarah Paulson-The Spirit, Serenity.This is based on a true story about a free black man in the 1850's-pre Civil War-that was kidnapped and sold into slavery. Chiwetel plays the man that lives in New York with his wife and two kids. He is abducted and taken to the deep south-Georgia, I think-where Benedict buys him at a slave auction. Chiwetel tries to explain his circumstances to anyone that will listen but nobody does and he is beaten into submission. After a disagreement with one of the 'Masters', Chiwetel is sold to Michael, who is not as kind as Benedict was. Sarah plays Michael's wife and she is not nice to the slaves, either. Besides beating his slaves, one of Michael's favorite pastimes is that he likes to have sexual relations with his female slaves. Which is one of the reasons Sarah is not nice to the slaves-she knows what Michael does. Anyone familiar with that period of time knows that is was not a good time to be a black person. The punishment slaves endured was usually a whip across the back, and not just a few lashes, either-some got 50 or more. Another punishment involved throwing a rope over a tree, with one end tied around the black person's neck. Some of the torture scenes were uncomfortable to watch, but I'm sure that that was the point. The acting was good, I can see some names popping up around Oscar time, and there are a few cameo actors that show up. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.",6,5,14,30 October 2013
Sausage Party," Totally Original
","I saw 'Sausage Party', starring the voices of Seth Rogen-The Neighbors movies, Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy; Kristen Wiig- Ghostbusters_2016, Anchorman 2:The Legend Continues; Bill Hader- Trainwreck, Pineapple Express and Salma Hayek-The Grown Ups movies, Wild Wild West_1999.A lot of people will gripe about movies, saying there are too many super hero movies or too many sequels......basically that there isn't anything original out there to see. Well, your gripes have been heard because this movie is really different and completely original. First of all, just because it is animated, doesn't mean it is for the little kiddies because it's NOT for kids. There is language, violence, drug use and even sexual content. It is from the mind of Seth Rogen-I read that he has been trying to make this movie for years. Seth plays a hot dog named Frank that has been led to believe-as well as all the other foods in the store-that when he is picked to go home with a human, it means he is literally going to heaven. Kristen is a hot dog bun, Salma is a taco and Bill is a bottle of liquor named Firewater-he is an American Indian. Circumstances happen that lets Seth discover the truth, that they are taken to be eaten by the humans and so he feels he must spread the word to all the other foods. A lot of the humor is crude and not for everyone but if you are looking for something a little different, you might be pleasantly surprised. It's rated 'R' for language, violence, drug use and sexual content-there is even an orgy-and has a running time of 1 hour & 29 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",7,12,25,12 August 2016
Joker," Dark Psychological Approach
","I saw 'Joker', starring Joaquin Phoenix-Walk the Line, Gladiator; Robert De Niro-The Comedian, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle; Brett Cullen-The Shallows, The Dark Knight Rises and Zazie Beetz-Deadpool 2, Atlanta_tv.
This is the first in the DC comics new line called DC Black Label. They will be stand alone movies not connected to the regular DC universe of movies. Joaquin plays Joker in this dark psychological approach to his origin story. You see his descent into madness and the violence here-although not a lot of it-is sudden and very graphic. Joaquin works as a clown while developing his joke telling abilities as a stand up comedian-he performs at clubs whenever possible. Robert plays a talk show host-think Johnny Carson-that gets a video of Joaquin's act and invites him on his show. Brett plays a man running for mayor that wants to clean up Gotham City-they have been having problems with people becoming vigilantes that are taking the law into their own hands and even killing people. Zazie plays Joaquin's neighbor that he has a crush on. There are times that you are not sure if a scene is really happening or if Joaquin is imagining it in his deep psychosis. As to the question of whether or not Batman makes an appearance or not; Yes & No. Bruce Wayne shows up, but not in costume.
It's rated 'R' for strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute.
I enjoyed this different look at a familiar character and would buy it on DVD.",8,2,7,5 October 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Sci-Fi Version of Groundhog Day
","I saw 'Edge of Tomorrow', starring Tom Cruise-The Mission:Impossible movies, with a fifth one coming out in 2015, Tropic Thunder; Emily Blunt-Looper, The Devil Wears Prada; Bill Paxton-Haywire, Apollo 13 and Brendan Gleeson-Safe House.This is a sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. It is based on a Japanese manga novel called 'All You Need is Kill'. Besides the sci-fi video game elements, there is a good story, as well as some very funny scenes. The story takes place in the not too distant future, when the Earth has been attacked by Aliens. Tom plays a military public relations reporter that has never been in any actual combat. Emily plays the macho battlefield commander that has become famous for killing lots of the spidery-looking aliens in fierce hand-to-hand combat. They even have her face plastered all over posters promoting her victories. Tom, under protest, gets sent in to cover a big offensive attack-kind of like a D-Day type invasion- and gets killed within ten minutes of hitting the beach. Just after he is killed-and it is explained exactly how this happens-Tom wakes up the day before and relives the day. Every time he is killed, this happens again and he learns more from each time. Plus, there are lots of funny moments as he learns. Brendan plays the General in command of Earth's forces that are based in London and Bill plays Tom's squad commander. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,4,6 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Entertaining Indulgent Behavior
","I saw 'The Wolf of Wall Street', starring Leonardo DiCaprio-Django Unchained, Critters 3; Jonah Hill-Django Unchained, Knocked Up; Margot Robbie-About Time, Pan Am-t.v. and Kyle Chandler-Zero Dark Thirty, King Kong-2005.This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese and is based on a true story about Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker in the 1990's. Leo plays the colorful Jordan and be warned, this movie is not for little kids. There is a lot of graphic nudity and drug consuming going on, all throughout the film. Jonah plays an eager disciple to Leo after seeing one of Leo's paycheck stubs; he wants to be just like him, so he quits his job and goes to work for him. Leo and Jonah start a new company and start raking in the money, under Leo's teaching skills. Margot is a guest at one of Leo's extravagant parties and Leo falls hard for her. They get married but the hookers and drugs keep right on coming. Of course, all these excesses in cocaine use and naked ladies-of-the-evening had to draw some attention, and F.B.I. agent Kyle shows up. There are a few good cameos scattered here and there-one of them has not acted in a movie in 10 years. There are a lot of humorous scenes, too-one in particular is when Leo is trying to drive his car, under the influence of Quaaludes. The story of stock fraud and all the indulgences that can come with having lots of cash is told with an enthusiasm that keeps you wanting to know what will happen next. It's rated 'R' for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including lots of nudity-and has a running time of 3 hours. The movie was very entertaining, which I was not expecting in a 3 hour movie-I was not bored-and I would buy this on DVD.",7,2,7,28 December 2013
It Chapter Two," Nice Conclusion
","I saw 'It Chapter Two', starring Jessica Chastain-Dark Phoenix, Interstellar; James McAvoy-Atomic Blonde, The Last King of Scotland; Bill Hader-Barry_tv, 22 Jump Street and Bill Skarsgard-Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde.
This is not really a sequel but more of a part 2 to the 2017 remake. It is best if you have seen chapter one because the kids from that one are in this one too, both in new and old scenes from chapter one. The adults playing the kids are all pretty good matches in looks-you might think that it is what they would really look like as adults. This is also not one to take the little kiddies to-I saw several people with little ones in tow, including a few babies. I guess they couldn't get a babysitter. Anyway, if you saw chapter one, you know that Pennywise pops up every 27 years and terrorizes the citizens of the little town of Derry. Jessica, James and Bill H, along with the rest of the Losers, get a phone call from one of their group, telling them it's been 27 years and it's time to come back to Derry to put an end to Pennywise, played magnificently by Bill S. All except for one of them have moved away and moved on with their lives-the one that stayed in town is the one that called them all back. Some of them are reluctant to come back but they did make a blood pact when they were kids. The violence is much more graphic and there is some partial nudity-don't get too excited, it is not a very pretty site. You do get to see Bill S out of his Pennywise make_up and Stephen King makes a cameo appearance-keep an eye out for the shop owner selling a bicycle.
It's rated 'R' for violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 49 minutes.
I thought it was a nice conclusion to the first part and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",8,7,11,7 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Star Studded Jumble
","I saw 'Hail, Caesar!', starring Josh Brolin-Everest, Milk; George Clooney-Tomorrowland, The Men Who Stare at Goats; Alden Ehrenreich- Beautiful Creatures, Stoker; Channing Tatum-The Hateful Eight, The Jump Street movies and Scarlett Johansson-Natasha in the Avenger & Captain America movies, We Bought a Zoo.This is a Coen Brothers movie. They did 'O Brother, Where Art Thou', 'Internal Cruelty' and 'Burn After Reading'-some I liked and some I didn't. There are several story lines going on here or you could say, a movie within a movie. Josh plays a fixer at a big Hollywood movie company. A fixer fixes problems involving the movie companies' bread & butter, the stars-such as a star getting pregnant or one getting drunk or on pills, etc. Any kind of scandal, Josh smooths things over and keeps people out of the headlines. George is just such an actor-inept and disappearing for days at a time, getting drunk or ending up in a young girls' bed. George is starring in a biblical epic called 'Hail Caesar!' and now, someone goes and kidnaps him. Alden is another actor in a western movie, Channing is in a musical movie and Scarlett is in a water ballet movie. All their story lines are going on simultaneously and some are connected to each other, in varying degrees. There are lots of cameos going on; I remember seeing Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Jonah Hill and Christopher Lambert popping up here and there. But as a whole, the movie was a little jumbled. There were funny parts but it's not really a comedy. I guess I'm not a big fan of the Coen Brothers. For instance, a lot of people I talk to really loved 'O Brother Where Art Thou' and I did not care for it. Oh well, different strokes... It's rated 'PG-13' for sexual content-no nudity-and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I would not rent it either. If you are a Coen fan, you might enjoy it more than I did. Otherwise, I'd wait until it comes to cable.",5,8,16,5 February 2016
12 Strong," Inspiring Story
","I saw '12 Strong', starring Chris Hemsworth-The Thor & Avengers movies, Vacation_2015; Michael Shannon-The Shape of Water, Jonah Hex; Michael Pena-CHIPS_2017, Vacation_2015 and Navid Negahban-American Assassin, American Sniper.
This is based on a true story. You probably have never heard about it because it has been classified for years. On 9-11-01, the World Trade Centers came crashing down in a terrorist attack and the next day, plans began on a top secret mission to be launched about a month later-in October-against the Taliban & Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, who were the perpetrators. Chris led the 12 man team of Special Forces soldiers on the first retaliation. Their bosses tell them it is a suicide mission and they don't think they can accomplish the job in less than 6-8 weeks. Even with Michael S & Michael P on the team, the 12 can not just take on the whole Taliban by themselves-no matter how good of soldiers they are-so they meet up with Navid, a local Warlord that hates the Taliban, and plans on leading them into battle. Their best means of transportation is by horses and some of the 12 have never even ridden a horse before-they get quick, on the job training. So, with all these issues in their path, it is pretty amazing that any of the 12 make it out alive-I won't spoil it for you here but you do find out how many by the end. It is an inspiring story. FYI: Chris' wife in the film is played by his real life wife, Elsa Pataky.
It's rated 'R' for war violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.
I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,14,33,22 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Best Kong Movie Ever
","I saw 'Kong:Skull Island', starring Tom Hiddleston-Loki in the Thor movies, I saw the Light; Samuel L. Jackson-The XXX movies, Star Wars:Episode 3_Revenge of the Sith; Brie Larson-Trainwreck, 13 Going on 30, Oh yeah, she is going to play Captain Marvel in 2019; John Goodman- Patriots Day, Evan Almighty and John C. Reilly-Guardians of the Galaxy.This is a reboot of the King Kong franchise and I think it's the best King Kong movie ever. The original one was in 1933, then they had a remake in 1976 and another in 2005. I have heard that the 2014 Godzilla was the beginning of a resurgence, with Godzilla:King of the Monsters in 2019 being the next one and then Godzilla vs King Kong in 2020. Anyway, this one is different from previous Kong movies-it takes place solely on Skull Island, with no New York skyscrapers in sight. It starts in 1944 with two pilots crash landing on an island-guess where? Then things shift to 1973, during the Vietnam war. John is a scientist getting a team together to explore an uncharted island in the Pacific-it's kind of like a Bermuda Triangle type area, where planes and ships have disappeared. Tom is hired as tracker and Brie is the journalist along to photograph their discoveries. Samuel is a colonel in the Army that is in charge of security. When they arrive on the island, they come across all sorts of giant behemoths; lizard type creatures, spiders, birds and even Kong, who fights some of them in glorious battles. You also find John, who was one of those pilots from 1944 that crashed on the island. You will also see Kong's parents. The fights and effects are fantastic. The music is pretty good, too, if you like rock. I remember hearing Jefferson Airplane, CCR, The Stooges, The Hollies and Black Sabbath, just to name a few. Make sure you stay until after the end credits because there is a scene and it has some bearing on future movies. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi violence and action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours. Like I said earlier, I think this is the best King Kong movie I've ever seen and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,4,10,10 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Satisfying Action Packed Finish
","I saw 'The Hobbit:The Battle of the Five Armies', starring Martin Freeman-Fargo_tv, Hot Fuzz; Richard Armitage-Into the Storm, Captain America:The First Avenger; Evangeline Lilly-The Hurt Locker, Lost_tv, Luke Evans-Dracula Untold, Fast & Furious 6 and Ian McKellen-Magneto in the X-Men movies, Last Action Hero. This is the third installment of the Hobbit series-or sixth, if you count the Lord of the Rings trilogy-that involves the legendary land called Middle-earth. It is directed by Peter Jackson, who directed all six movies. It is also the best of the Hobbit trilogy, in my opinion. This one starts right after the second one ends, where Smaug the dragon was attacking the town. After the situation is resolved, everyone heads for Smaug's fortress, where all the gold and treasures are just sitting there, waiting to be plundered. Luke-Bard leads the surviving townsfolk on the trek to the mountains but finds that Richard-Thorin and his fellow dwarfs have beat them to it and have barricaded themselves inside the fortress, and do not plan on giving it up. Martin-Bilbo is with Richard and the dwarfs and sees that Richard has been driven a little crazy with greed-he has even declared himself king of the dwarfs and has forgotten about almost everything else. Ian-Gandalf shows up to warn everybody of an invasion of Orcs, the big, ugly white creatures that like to ride big, scary looking wolf-like creatures. Evangeline- Tauriel and her fellow elves also arrive in time for the big, glorious battle, which lasts about 45 minutes. The battle is pretty brutal, with elves, dwarfs, Orcs and even regular old humans, all slugging it out over the great treasures that Smaug had collected. Even though I remember seeing lots of heads-and other body parts-being cut off during all the carnage, I don't remember seeing much blood-so it was not too gory for the younger viewers. It does end on a satisfying note. It's rated 'PG-13' for intense violence and frightening images and has a running time of 2 hours & 24 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,10,21,17 December 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," Thinking Man's Workout
","I saw 'Murder on the Orient Express', starring Kenneth Branagh- Dunkirk, Wild Wild West_1999; Johnny Depp-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Dark Shadows_2012; Michelle Pfeiffer-Mother!, Dark Shadows_2012 and Daisy Ridley-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, Lifesaver. This is a remake of the 1974 movie that is based on an Agatha Christie novel she wrote in 1934. She wrote quite a few books about an observant detective named Hercule Poirot, a Belgium version of Sherlock Holmes-she also wrote about a character named Miss Marple or something like that but I did not read them. I remember reading and being a fan of her books on Hercule Poirot when I was growing up. This movie is directed by Kenneth Branagh-Cinderella_2015, Jack Ryan:Shadow Recruit, Thor-who also stars as the famous detective. Kenneth is taking a trip on the Orient Express train traveling from Istanbul to Paris with 13 other passengers-all quite recognizable actors. Johnny, Michelle and Daisy are some of the passengers, all of which have secrets that come to light when one of the 13 turns up dead. Boy, it's lucky that they have the world's greatest detective on board to help solve the case. One of the passengers was involved in a baby kidnapping that took place 5 years earlier. This movie is not an action packed shoot em up but more of a thinking man's workout for your brain, although there is a little physical fisticuffs and some gun play. Oh yeah, I must mention Kenneth's mustache; It is rather big and very well groomed-he sleeps with a mask over it to protect it. At the end of the movie, there is a set up for the next one, Death on the Nile-that is, if this one makes money. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. As I said earlier, I am a fan and enjoyed it enough to buy it on DVD.",7,4,11,11 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Great Family Movie
","I saw 'The Secret Life of Pets', starring the voices of Louis C.K.- American Hustle, Parks and Recreation_tv; Eric Stonestreet-Modern Family_tv, Ninja Cheerleaders; Jenny Slate-Parks and Recreation_tv, This Means War; Kevin Hart-Central Intelligence, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Lake Bell-Children's Hospital_tv, What Happens in Vegas.This is an animated movie by the studios that brought us the Minions. In fact, there is a Minions short cartoon shown, right before the movie starts-I think it was called Mower Minions. If you have ever wondered what pets do when their owners go to work, this movie gives some interesting guesses. Louis is a small dog-Terrier, I think-and living the perfect life with his owner in New York City. That is until she brings home a second dog, Eric, a big mongrel. Of course, jealousy sets in and after Louis & Eric get separated from their owner, they learn they may just have to work together to survive. Jenny is a small dog that likes Louis so she is the first to notice when he goes missing. Lake is a cat that becomes a member of the search party searching for Louis & Eric and Kevin is a not-so-lovable bunny that is leading stray animals-living in the sewers ever since they were discarded by their owners-in a revolt against humans. It seems that Kevin has anger issues ever since he parted ways with his magician owner. As the end credits start, there is a scene, but nothing at the very end. I enjoyed it and the children with us seemed to like it, too. It's rated 'PG' for action and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",7,5,9,9 July 2016
Finding Dory," Another Winner
","I saw 'Finding Dory', starring the voices of Ellen DeGeneres-Pauly Shore is Dead, Coneheads; Albert Brooks-Concussion, Drive; Ed O'Neill-Modern Family_tv, The Bone Collector and Sigourney Weaver-Chappie, Avatar.This is a sequel to the 2003 'Finding Nemo', which is 13 years later-if my math is correct-but the time period in this movie takes place only a year later. Ellen/Dory gets separated from her parents and runs into Albert/Marlin, who helps her in her quest to be reunited with them. If you recall from the previous movie, Ellen has a short term memory loss. Thankfully, she runs into lots of helpful friends, which seems to be the theme of the movie; Sometimes, you need friends. Ed/Hank is an octopus that becomes a friend and Sigourney plays the voice who is in charge of the Marine Life Institute-she is never actually shown as a character, only heard over the speaker systems. It's kind of like Seaworld where they have sea creatures on display for the public and they also will do rescue and release service for the fish and they will then release them back into the oceans-or to a zoo, if that is where they are needed. Before the movie, there was a 6 minute cartoon called 'Piper', about a baby sandpiper learning to hunt for food at the beach. Also, there is a scene after the end credits, at the very end of the movie, so try to keep your little ones seated until then, if you can-it should be easy enough since they show scenes all through the end credits. This is another hit for Pixar/Disney. It's rated 'PG' for thematic elements and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie, as did everyone with me, and I would buy it on DVD.",7,2,12,18 June 2016
Arrival," Good Story But NOT Action Packed
","I saw 'Arrival', starring Amy Adams-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, American Hustle; Jeremy Renner-Hawkeye in the Avengers movies, American Hustle; Forest Whitaker-Taken 3, Panic Room and Tzi Ma-Million Dollar Arm, 24_tv.This is an alien invasion movie for the crowd that is tired of all those action packed blockbusters. There is very little action here. It's more along the lines of a mental exercise. It's based on a book by Ted Chiang called 'The Story of Your Life' and the movie starts with Amy talking about her daughter's life-from when she was a baby until she became an adult. Amy is a linguistics professor-she can work languages like a puzzle and get to the true meaning of dialects better than anyone. All of a sudden, 12 alien looking objects appear all over the world, just hovering about 20 feet off the ground. Forest, dressed in a military uniform, shows up on Amy's door step, saying they need her help in establishing communications with the aliens. He takes her to the closest one in Montana where Jeremy is waiting-he is a mathematician on the team. Their mission is to find out if the aliens are friendly or just looking for something to barbecue for the weekend. The military are in contact with the other countries where the other 11 objects are located but no one will swap information with each other-each is afraid to give someone else an advantage over themselves. Tzi plays the head of China and he is ready to start attacking the aliens at any moment so there is a time limit going on. It's not a bad movie, just not action packed. Example; I remember one explosion and no one even got hurt-I think they just put it in to make people think the action was about to really get cranking...but, nope, that was it. It's rated 'PG-13' for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It would be alright as a rental, if you are not into action-Like I am.",6,2,11,11 November 2016
Parasite," Who Is The Parasite?
","I saw 'Parasite', starring Kang_Ho Song-Snowpiercer, The Good The Bad The Weird; Woo_Sik Choi-Okja, Set Me Free; So_Dam Park-Fukuoka, The Priests and Hye_Jin Jang-Mothers, Marine Boy.
In case you couldn't tell by the actors names above, this is a South Korean movie with sub_titles. It explores the question, exactly who is the parasite? Between the rich and the poor, either group could be considered a parasite on the other one. Kang_Ho is the father of an unemployed family in South Korea. When an opportunity pops up for his son, Woo_Sik, to be a private tutor to a rich family, Woo_Sik gets an idea for employing the rest of his family, including his father, Kang_Ho, his sister, So_Dam, and his mother, Hye_Jin. There are complications, of course, which come to a head as each member of his family takes the place of a former employee and before it's over, blood is spilled and people are dead.
It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD, but it would be a good rental.",7,2,6,29 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Interestingly Weird

It's directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu-Biutiful, Babel, 21 Grams. From what I had heard about the film, it sounded interesting, but by the time it was over, I just did not get it. Michael plays an actor that was big back in the 1990's for playing a super hero called Birdman. He made three Birdman movies and was offered a forth but decided that he had had enough of the character and said no-sounds close to what really happened with Michael and the Batman series. Now, he wants to direct and star in a Broadway play to show everyone that he is a real actor and can do serious material. The weird part comes in when Michael starts hallucinating-at least, that is what I understood it to be-conversations with his Birdman character. Michael also displays telekinetic powers-or is he just hallucinating?-like moving objects, just by looking at them and turning things on and off, with a wave of his hand. Emma plays Michael's daughter, who has recently gotten out of drug rehab and is now helping her father as an assistant or gofer. Zach plays Michael's manager and Edward is another actor in the play. One of the interesting tidbits is that most of the movie looks like it was shot in one take. There are a couple of places where you can tell there are cuts but for the most part, it looks like just one long take. It's rated 'R' for language, sexual content-partial nudity-and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD but it is interesting enough to be a rental.",6,1,9,15 November 2014
The Conjuring," Good Scares
","I saw 'The Conjuring', starring Vera Farmiga-Bates Motel-t.v., The Departed; Patrick Wilson-The A-Team-2010, Lakeview Terrace; Lili Taylor-Public Enemies, High Fidelity and Ron Livingston-Dinner for Schmucks, Office Space. This is a horror film that reminded me of the older classic horror films, such as 'The Amityville Horror', 'The Exorcist' and 'Poltergeist'. Maybe it's because there are not a lot of CGI special effects used. Instead, it is mostly actors in make up as the demon spirits. This movie is also based on a true story and takes place in the early 1970's. Vera and Patrick are a married couple that are paranormal investigators or demonologists-she has psychic abilities that drain her every time she uses them. They investigate paranormal activities and either debunk a situation as having a normal explanation or they help get rid of the problem-they have to call the Vatican if an exorcism is needed. Patrick even has a room in his house where he keeps occult mementos from his past cases, as souvenirs. Anyone visiting the room can look at, but not touch, an object, in case they were to release some evil. Lili and Ron are a married couple with 5 little girls that buy a haunted house and call upon the services of Patrick and Vera after strange happenings start disrupting their lives. I thought it was suspenseful and had some pretty good scares. It is rated 'R' for violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I would buy this on DVD.",7,0,1,19 July 2013
Wonder Woman," DC Got It Right!
","I saw 'Wonder Woman', starring Gal Gadot-Keeping Up With the Joneses, the Fast & the Furious movies; Chris Pine-The New Star Trek movies, Into the Woods; Robin Wright-Moneyball, Forrest Gump; Danny Huston-Big Eyes, Clash of the Titans_2010 and David Thewlis-Red 2, the Harry Potter movies.This is the first female starring superhero film that is directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins, who directed Monster-and before you get your panties all knotted up, I said directed by a woman, because there have been female superhero movies before. Gal plays Princess Diana of Themyscira, home of the Amazons. If you remember her debut in the not as good Batman vs. Superman, this movie starts in the present time as she gets the photograph from Bruce Wayne of her that was taken during WW1. The majority of the movie is a flashback telling the story behind the picture, plus her origin, too, of course. Robin plays Gal's Amazon aunt that helps train Gal in the finer points of being a warrior. These training sessions and other battle scenes are unbelievably athletic and graceful and there is a lot of humor throughout the movie, too. Chris plays Steve Trevor, a British spy that crash lands right off the coast of Themyscira during a top secret mission. Gal saves him from drowning and discovers the horrors of war in the outside world. She travels back with Chris and when she comes face to face with a certain Nazi officer, Danny, she believes Danny is actually the God of War, Ares, in disguise. David plays a British commander that helps Chris on his and Gal's mission to end the war and restore peace. DC has not had the track record of good movies like Marvel has but I think they got it right on this one. FYI: I heard a rumor-before seeing the movie-that Linda Carter would make a cameo appearance, but she did not show up. It's rated 'PG-13' for action, violence and sexual content-partial nudity and before you get too excited, it was of Chris, not Gal-and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,5,12,2 June 2017
Straight Outta Compton," For The Fans
","I saw 'Straight Outta Compton', starring O'Shea Jackson Jr.-In his first movie and he is the real life son of Ice Cube, which is nice, since he is playing him; Corey Hawkins-Non-Stop, Iron Man 3; Jason Mitchell-Broken City, Contraband and Paul Giamatti-San Andreas, Rock of Ages.This is the story of how the rap/hip hop group NWA formed. If you know me, you know that I am not a fan of this type of music but the story is interesting. I'm sure you know what NWA stands for but just in case you don't, it's the 'N' word, With Attitude. Straight Outta Compton was the name of their first album and Compton is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California that is famous for the rough street life, what with all the gangs and drug dealers, not to mention corrupt police that would harass people just because of their skin color. Remember the Rodney King beating? O'Shea/Ice Cube, Corey/Dr,Dre and Jason/Easy E were the core members that formed the group that used their music to talk about life in the hood in the late 1980's and early 1990's. They paved the way for lots of other stars and they were arrested during their concerts for their lyrics-some of which were 'F The Police!'-and inciting riots. Paul plays their manager. Other artists during this time period are shown, including Suge Knight, Snoop Dogg and Tupac. It also shows some stuff after NWA break up, including Ice Cube's getting the acting bug. It's rated 'R' for language, violence, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 27 minutes. If you are a fan, you will probably like it more than I did. I would not buy it on DVD. It would be a good rental.",6,1,29,28 August 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," BDSM For Dummies
","I saw 'Fifty Shades of Grey', starring Dakota Johnson-Need For Speed, 21 Jump Street_2012-FYI: she is the daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith; Jamie Dornan-The Fall_tv, Once Upon a Time_tv; Marcia Gay Harden-Into the Wild, Bad News Bears_2005 and Jennifer Ehle-Zero Dark Thirty, The King's Speech.This is based on the book trilogy that is written by E.L. James, and no, I have not read the books. It is an 'R' rated erotic movie that is based on an 'NC-17' book about BDSM-if you do not know what those initials stand for, then you have probably not read the books, either. The director wanted to make the film 'NC-17' but the studios wanted a lower 'R' ratting to get more bodies into the seats of the theaters. Dakota plays an English college major that gets roped into doing an interview for her ailing roommate. Jamie plays the billionaire being interviewed and he has a rather kinky hobby; he is into BDSM-FYI: the first time this hobby is actually shown being engaged in, is around 45 minutes into the film. Once Dakota is introduced into the red room-that is his play room-she discovers more about sex than she had ever known-before meeting Jamie, she was a virgin. Jamie even has a contract that spells out all of his rules, some of which state that he does not sleep in the bed with her, after having sex-she has her own room to go to, for sleeping. Everything sexual is consensual, with safe words spelled out in the contract, but he is a control freak that wants things his way, whenever he says so-hence, the contract. The only problem is that Dakota wants to have a normal relationship-go to dinner or a movie-in between the bondage and spankings with her kinky boyfriend but he does not even like her to touch him, when they are not having sex. Now, before you start thinking that this is just a big budget porno movie, the sex scenes of the 2 hour movie only constitute about 15 minutes of the entire movie and his 'equipment' is not ever shown. Marcia plays Jamie's mother and Jennifer plays Dakota's mother. Beyonce' does one of the songs in the movie. The only problem I had was in the abrupt ending-but they could be just setting things up for a sequel, depending on how much this one makes. It's rated 'R' for language and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",6,0,2,16 February 2015
The Wolverine," Wolverine in Japan
","I saw 'The Wolverine', starring Hugh Jackman-Les Miserables-2012, Swordfish; Tao Okamoto-a Japanese actress in her first movie; Svetlana Khodchenkova-a Russian actress in her 2nd English movie, her 1st being Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy-2011 and Will Yun Lee-Red Dawn-2012, Elektra.This is based on an early comic book storyline that centered around the adventures of Wolverine in Japan. The movie starts in WW2, where Hugh, aka Wolverine, saves the life of a Japanese soldier. Then the movie shifts to somewhere right after 'X-Men: the Last Stand', because Hugh is having dreams of Jean Grey-and if you remember, he killed her in that film. Hugh then gets a message to go to Japan because the soldier he saved years ago wants to see him. The soldier has become a big industrialist and is one of the most powerful men in Japan. The only problem is, he is dying and giving his fortune to his granddaughter, Tao. That does not sit well with a lot of people, including Tao's relatives because they were skipped over in the inheritance windfall, so lots of people are trying to kill Tao. Hugh comes to the rescue but runs into a mutant , Svetlana, that goes by the name of Viper and she messes with Hugh's healing factor. Will plays a boyhood friend/bodyguard to Tao. There is a really good fight atop a bullet train-I think it travels around 200-300 mph-there are ninjas-to be expected in Japan-the Silver Samurai and Hugh performs open-heart surgery on.....Well, you have to see it to believe it. There is a scene that sets up the next X-Men movie, right after the credits start, but there is not a scene at the very end. It is rated 'PG-13' for violence, language and sexuality-no nudity except partial nudity of Hugh in a bath tub-and has a running time of 2 hours & 6 minutes. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,2,5,26 July 2013
The Croods," Nice Family Film
","This is an animated movie about the last surviving prehistoric caveman family meeting the next human in the evolution of man . Nicolas plays the father of the caveman family and Ryan is the inventive boy that is the next generation-he knows how to create fire , use his brain , etc. . Catherine is Nicolas' wife and Emma is his daughter . Nicolas protects his family by living in a cave- he thinks it is the safest place to be, but when something happens to it , they are forced to go on a journey far from their safety zone-that is when they meet Ryan . Ryan helps them on their journey . This is a nice family movie by Dreamworks and if you can stay after the credits , there is a quick-about 30 seconds-scene involving some prehistoric mice playing music . It's rated 'PG' for some scary action scenes and has a running time of 1 hour & 38 minutes . I can see buying this one on DVD . I think my grandkids would like it .",8,0,0,16 April 2013
Black Panther," Loved This Movie
","I saw 'Black Panther', starring Chadwick Boseman-Gods of Egypt, Draft Day; Michael B. Jordon-Creed, Fantastic Four_2015; Lupita Nyong'o-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, 12 Years a Slave; Danai Gurira-The Walking Dead_tv, All Eyez On Me and Andy Serkis-Star Wars:The Force Awakens, The Lord of the Rings movies.
This is based on a comic book hero that has been around since 1966, when he made his first appearance in a Fantastic Four comic. FYI: His debut was about 2 months before the militant Black Panther Party made their debut, so there was no connection between the two. Chadwick plays T'Challa, the son of the King of Wakanda, an East African country that is more than it appears to be. They have a precious metal called Vibranium that powers their whole country. They use it for all sorts of technological wonders; weapons, transportation, medicinal, etc. Vibranium can absorb and then refocus energy and it was even used in making Captain Americas' shield. When his father dies-as seen in Captain America:Civil War, Chadwick's first cinematic appearance-Chadwick returns to become King, and the new Black Panther, as was his father before him. That's when multiple problems start hitting the fan. First, Andy steals some Vibranium and Chadwick has to try and stop him-the policy of Wakanda is to keep their high technology a big secret from the outside world, so as to prevent misuse of the metal. Then Michael shows up, claiming to be the rightful heir to the Wakandian throne and challenges Chadwick to a fight. Lupita plays Chadwick's love interest and Danai is the head of security for Chadwick. Stan Lee pops up in his customary cameo-look for him in the casino scene-and there are 2 scenes at the end. The first is right after the end credits start and the second one is at the very end, so make sure you stay until the very end-it has a familiar character show up.
It's rated 'PG-13' for action, violence and a rude gesture and it has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes.
As you might guess, I loved this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,9,46,17 February 2018
Mother!," Just Plain Weird
","I saw 'Mother!', starring Jennifer Lawrence-Passengers, The Beaver; Javier Bardem-Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Men Tell No Tales, Eat Pray Love; Ed Harris-Westworld_tv, Snowpiercer and Michelle Pfeiffer- The Family, Amazon Women on the Moon.Let me start by saying, I like lots of different types of movies. But this one, is not one of them. It is just plain weird. I know it is suppose to be symbolic concerning materialism that has run amok among humanity but it is just too far out there for my tastes. It is written & directed by Darren Aronofsky-Black Swan, The Wrestler, The Fountain- who is actually dating Jennifer Lawrence in real life-they met working on this movie. I read that this movie is loosely inspired by Rosemary's Baby but that is very loosely. There is a baby-but trust me, you do not want to know what happens to him-and there are fanatical people that show up from who knows where. Jennifer & Javier are married and live in a country house-no close neighbors-that Jennifer is in the process of renovating while Javier tries to write. Ed shows up, unexpectedly, and Javier welcomes him, saying it might help his mental block. Ed claims that he is an admirer and a fan of Javier. Then, Michelle shows up-she is Ed's wife-and decides to stay, too. Mind you, neither Jennifer or Javier know them. More and more people show up and then things get really weird. If you like trying to figure out symbolism in your stories, you might like this film more than I did. It's rated 'R' for violence, language, disturbing images-one in particular is very disturbing-and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours. I did not like this movie and would not buy it on DVD. I wouldn't rent it, either. If you really have a hankerin' to see it, I would wait until it comes to cable TV.",3,12,20,16 September 2017
Creed II," If You Are A Rocky Fan, You Should Enjoy It
","I saw 'Creed 2', starring Michael B. Jordan-Black Panther, Friday Night Lights_tv; Sylvester Stallone-The Expendables movies, the Rocky movies; Tessa Thompson-Westworld_tv, Thor:Ragnarok; Dolph Lundgren-Kindergarten Cop 2, the Expendables movies and Florian 'Big Nasty' Munteanu-this is his first movie.
This is a sequel to the 2015 Creed movie-which is a spin off of the Rocky movies-following the life of Michael/Adonis Creed, the son of Apollo Creed, from the Rocky movies. If you are a Rocky fan, you should enjoy this movie. Sylvester/Rocky Balboa is Michael's trainer. Tessa plays Michael's singer girlfriend that has a hearing problem. Michael is riding high since he became the world champ but Dolph/Ivan Drago puts a crimp in his celebration by challenging Michael to fight his son, Florian/Viktor Drago. If you remember from the Rocky movies, Dolph killed Michael's father in the ring so there is some bad blood between them. Even Sylvester is wary of the fight-wait until you see Florian and you will probably agree that it's not a good idea. The guy is huge. The fights are brutal and staged very well. There are a couple of cameos from people that were in previous Rocky movies.
It's rated 'PG-13' for sports action violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.
I really liked it and would buy it on DVD.",8,10,19,22 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Nice Set Up For The JLA
","I saw 'Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice', starring Ben Affleck-Gone Girl, Daredevil; Henry Cavill-The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Red Riding Hood; Jesse Eisenberg-American Ultra, 30 Minutes or Less and Gal Gadot-Triple 9, The Fast & Furious movies.This is DC's big entry into the team comic book movies, such as Marvel's The Avengers. The Justice in the title is referring to the Justice League. This movie continues from the events of 2013's The Man of Steel and is leading up to the Justice League movies-there are some very short glimpses of other heroes from the future JLA movies in this movie. At the end of Man of Steel, Henry/Superman and General Zod had a knock down, drag out fight that destroyed property and endangered lives. Ben/Batman thinks Henry should be held accountable and decides it's up to him to bring Superman to justice. If you are at all familiar with comic books, this is a frequent happening, where two heroes have a misunderstanding at first, fight each other and then become friends and team up to fight the bad guys in the end. Most non-comic book readers ask, 'Just how can Batman even fight Superman?' One word, and it starts with a 'K'. That is one of the reasons why I like Batman; he plans his battles in advance to level the playing field-In the comics, Batman has files on all of his teammates and how he can take them down, just in case of an emergency. Jesse plays Lex Luthor who has his hands in several bad guy type activity; smuggling, selling weapons and Oh Yeah, creating monsters. One such creation is Doomsday. Doomsday is the reason our heroes get to team up, and they even include their female member Gal/Wonder Woman. Overall, it's pretty good. A little slow in places, and that seems weird saying that, in a two & a half hour movie, but it was enjoyable. One caution; Some people may not like the ending but it is straight out of the comics. It's rated 'PG-13' for action, violence and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours and 31 minutes. It was good to see the set up for the JLA and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,2,5,25 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," Catchy Tunes
","I saw 'The Greatest Showman', starring Hugh Jackman-Eddie the Eagle, Deception; Michelle Williams-Manchester By the Sea, Deception; Zac Efron-Baywatch_2017, Charlie St. Cloud and Zendaya-Spider_Man:Homecoming, Shake It Up_tv.
This is a musical that is based on the life of P.T. Barnum. Hugh plays Mr Barnum, the man that invented show business. He started from nothing and using his ingenuity, ended up with the world's most famous circus. Michelle plays his wife, whose parents did have money but she didn't care about any of that. She just loved Hugh, no matter how much money he had. Ah, romance. Hugh starts out with a museum that he soon developed into his more popular circus venue that would showcase all types of people and animals, from a bearded lady to elephants, and was non-discriminatory-he didn't care what they looked like, as long as they brought in the crowds and made him money. Zendaya was one of Hugh's performers-she was a trapeze artist-and Zac was his business partner, who also just happens to like trapeze artists. The songs are written by the same songwriters as 'La La Land' so they are some mighty catchy tunes. It just takes me some getting used to, when people break into song all the time instead of just talking. And I know that there is an audience for this type of movie but I'm not a big musical fan-there are very few musicals that I did like-but if you are a fan, you will probably like this one more than I did.
It's rated 'PG' for thematic elements and a brawl and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-I mentioned that I'm not a big musical fan-but it would be a good rental.",7,1,3,26 December 2017
Casino Royale," Excellent prequel
","This is the 21st James Bond movie & they decided to do like several other franchises , such as Batman Begins & Superman Returns , have done lately ; go back to the beginning & tell how our hero started out . Daniel Craig , from Lara Croft:Tomb Raider & Road to Perdition , plays a rougher , grittier Bond . There are lots of action sequences with more running & just plain physical action , than in most Bond movies . The fight scenes are brutal & realistically staged . You see Bond's first kills , that make him eligible for his '00' status . Judi Dench returns , or I guess you could say begins , as 'M' . Mads Mikkelsen , from King Arthur , plays the villain . Eva Green , from Kingdom of Heaven , is a Bond girl & Jeffrey Wright , from Ali , plays Felix Leiter . You see how Bond gets his first Aston Martin & it's not from Her Majesty's Secret Service . You also see what helps shape Bond into the Super-Spy that he later becomes . There are several 'nods' to Bond staples , such as the Martini that he favors shaken , not stirred . There are not a lot of gadgets , since there isn't a 'Q' yet . The only time it slows down is during the card game . There is also a torture scene that is faithful to the original book & very difficult for most men to watch . Overall , I really enjoyed it & I can't wait until it's available on DVD .",9,0,2,21 November 2006
Saving Mr. Banks," The Story of How 'Mary Poppins' was made
","I saw 'Saving Mr. Banks', starring Tom Hanks-Captain Phillips, Saving Private Ryan; Emma Thompson-Men in Black 3, Nanny McPhee; Colin Farrell- Seven Psychopaths, Horrible Bosses and Bradley Cooper-Trophy Wife-t.v., The West Wing-t.v..This is the story of how Walt Disney, played by Tom, tried to persuade the author of 'Mary Poppins', played by Emma, into making a Disney movie of her work. Around 1938 is when Tom first tried to get the rights to it because of his daughters loving the book so much. Every year, for twenty years, he kept trying but Emma did not want her beloved piece of fiction to be turned into a cartoon, like Mickey Mouse-she hated animation, and at that time, Disney had only made animated movies. After twenty years, in 1961, she finally agreed to meet with Tom and hear him out, as long as she had final approval-no animation. The movie tells two stories simultaneously; one is the negotiations between Tom and Emma in 1961 and the other takes place in 1907, in Australia. At first, you may wonder what is going on but you soon find out how they are connected. Colin is in the 1907 story in Australia and Bradley is in the newer one in 1961. Emma is very unlikable; she hates just about everything they show her, but there is a reason for it. There is a lot of humor in the movie but be ready for some tearful moments, too. FYI: If you are familiar with 'Mary Poppins', you probably know about the animated penguins sequence and you probably know who Mr. Banks is. Also, in real life, Tom Hanks is a distant cousin of Walt Disney and next year, 2014, is the fiftieth anniversary of the release of 'Mary Poppins'. It's rated 'PG-13' for some unsettling images-some smoking and drinking- and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes. It was an interesting and entertaining movie and I enjoyed it, as well as my wife. I'm not too sure if little kids would enjoy it but I would buy this on DVD.",7,1,2,21 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," Quirky Dark Comedy
","I saw 'Jojo Rabbit', starring Roman Griffin Davis-in his first movie; Scarlett Johansson-the Avengers movies, Eight Legged Freaks; Sam Rockwell-Vice, Cowboys & Aliens and Taika Waititi-What We Do in the Shadows, Green Lantern.
This is a quirky dark comedy about WW2. Roman plays a 10 year old boy in Nazi Germany during WW2 that is in a Hitler youth camp-they train children to become Nazi soldiers. Sam plays one of the teachers that instills hatred of the Jewish persuasion into their young naive minds. Things such as that Jews have magic powers, can control minds, hang from the ceiling like bats to sleep, etc. Scarlett plays Roman's mother, who does not share those beliefs. In fact, Scarlett gives refuge to a Jewish girl by hiding her in the attic but she doesn't tell Roman because of his schooling, so when he finds her hiding place, there is a dilemma. Should he turn her in, like a good Nazi? Or if he does, will his mother get in trouble for hiding her? Taika plays Roman's imaginary friend that Roman talks to for advice-no one else can see Hitler. FYI: Taika also wrote and directed the movie.
It's rated 'PG-13' for disturbing images, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you like quirky, then it would be a good rental.",6,1,7,10 November 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Covers Basics of a Great Sequel
","I saw 'Thor: The Dark World', starring Chris Hemsworth-Red Dawn-2012, Star Trek-2009; Natalie Portman-Black Swan, Zoolander; Tom Hiddleston- The Avengers-2012, The Deep Blue Sea; Christopher Eccleston-G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, Doctor Who-t.v.-2005 and Anthony Hopkins-Red 2, The Mask of Zorro.This is the second Thor movie, or actually the third, if you count the Avengers, and it covers all the basics of a good sequel. Chris returns as Thor, fighting the battle against evil dark elves, who are led by Christopher, as Malekith. It seems that there is an evil energy force called the Aether, which is so powerful that it could mean the end of everything, and guess who wants it? Yep, Christopher. FYI: For all the comic book nerds like me, the Aether is known by another name that you should know, it's one of the six Infinity Gems. Anthony returns as Odin, the father of Chris and the king of the nine realms, including Asgard, their home planet. Tom returns as Chris's evil brother Loki, who is sentenced by Anthony to be put into the deepest dungeon that can be found on Asgard, mainly for his part in the Avengers escapade in New York. Natalie has found her way to London, in her search for Chris; she wants to find a connection between Earth and Asgard so that they can be reunited. The only problem is that she gets into a situation where she ends up possessing the elusive Aether that Christopher wants and the hunt is on. Chris even has to bust his brother Tom out of jail to help in the good fight. But, can Tom be trusted? One of his nicknames is 'The Trickster' or god of lies. There are some good fight sequences, I especially liked it when Chris would spin his hammer before applying it to the job at hand, just like in the comics. I also liked the balance of humor with the action. As far as cameos go, Stan Lee appears in the mental hospital scene-he wants his shoe back-and there is a small scene with the appearance of another super hero in costume. When the end credits start, there is a scene, and then at the very end is another scene, so don't leave early, or you will miss the set up for the next movie. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,5,11,8 November 2013
Lucy," Good Story But Weird Ending
","I saw 'Lucy', starring Scarlett Johansson-The Black Widow in the Avengers_plus she is getting her own Black Widow movie, The Spirit; Morgan Freeman-Last Vegas, Wanted; Min-sik Choi-I saw the Devil, Oldboy_2003 and Amr Waked-Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Syriana.This is a pretty good action movie that is written & directed by Luc Besson, who had a hand in some of my favorite movies, including La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element, the Transporter movies and the Taken movies. Scarlett plays a girl that ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time, because of her sleazy boyfriend. Min-sik is a drug dealer that enlists Scarlett's unwilling assistance in smuggling a new designer drug through customs-it is surgically implanted into her stomach. After a mis-hap, the drugs get into her system and starts changing her metabolism. It increases her brain usage capacity-most people only use about 10%-and keeps increasing it, so that she gets smarter and smarter and starts developing heightened senses, telekinesis and even a little mind control. Morgan plays a scientist that just happened to be an expert in the human mind, at least 10% of it, and has written papers on what would happen if a person could use more that 10%. So of course, Scarlett wants to meet him and talk shop with him. Amr is a policeman that befriends Scarlett and goes along for the ride of his life. If you like Luc Besson movies, then you know he is good with action and car chases and believe it or not, there are even dinosaurs that make an appearance. The only problem was the ending; I will not give it away here but it was a little weird. It's rated 'R' for violence, sexuality-no nudity-and some disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I really enjoyed it-except for the ending-and would but it on DVD.",7,2,12,25 July 2014
Midway," Excellent Battle Scenes
","I saw 'Midway', starring Ed Skrein-Alita:Battle Angel, Deadpool; Patrick Wilson-Aquaman, Watchmen; Mandy Moore-This Is Us_tv, 47 Meters Down and Luke Evans-the Fast & Furious movies, The Three Musketeers_2011.
This movie is based on real life events that happened in the Pacific Ocean during 1941. It starts with the Pearl Harbor attack by Japan and continues through to the battle of Midway. It shows both sides of the conflicts-the American Fleet vs the Japanese Navy-but leans heavily on the Americans' struggles, of course. Ed plays a top pilot with Mandy as his concerned wife. Patrick is the head of military intelligence for the U.S. and Luke is another pilot. There are several good cameos-I remember seeing Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid, Aaron Eckhart and Nick Jonas-and lots of excellent battle scenes. During the end credits, the real people the actors are portraying are shown and you learn what happened to them after Midway. If you are a WW2 fan/buff, you should enjoy this one.
It's rated 'PG-13' for war violence, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.",7,6,9,11 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Well Worth It!
","I saw 'Star Wars:The Force Awakens', starring Daisy Ridley-In her first major movie; John Boyega-Junkhearts, Attack The Block; Oscar Isaac-Ex Machina, Inside Llewyn Davis, FYI:He is playing Apocalypse in X- Men:Apocalypse and Adam Driver-This is Where I Leave You, Inside Llewyn Davis. It has finally arrived. And it was well worth it. J J Abrams-Star Trek_2009, Mission:Impossible 3, Alias_tv-directs this installment in the Star Wars saga, which takes place about 30 years after 'Return of the Jedi. Mark Hamill/Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford/Han Solo, Carrie Fisher/Leia, Chewbacca, C3PO, R2D2-all of which make appearances in this one-and all the other resistance fighters have been celebrating their triumph over the evil Empire. Mark even became a teacher and started training new Jedi Knights. But something goes wrong with one of his students-Adam-and Mark decides to quit and he just up and disappears. The old Empire is now using a new name, First Order, and they want to kill Mark and prevent any further new Jedis. Adam/Kylo Ren becomes the chief enforcer of the First Order, using the dark side of the Force and becoming what could well be described as the new Darth Vader. He also has a neat lightsaber with 2 little blades coming out of the handle. Oscar is the new hot shot resistance fighter pilot that is on a mission with his trusty robot, BB8, to get a map leading to Mark's secret location to Carrie-It seems like everyone wants a piece of Mark. John is a stormtrooper that deserts his position with the First Order because he doesn't like all the killing-I guess he did not read his employment contract too closely. John meets Daisy, a scavenging mechanical wizard that lives on a desert planet and they soon are working together. There are lots of similarities with the 1977 original SW:Episode 4 A New Hope; From the opening scroll explaining what has happened previously to the fighter pilots attacking a giant planet shaped weapon. Even the Millennium Falcon shows up. At least 2 of the new characters have very strong connections to the original cast members and there is a major death. Oh yeah, John Williams is still doing the music-he did all the previous Star Wars movies. FYI: Despite all the talk of Mark, he has a very short amount of screen time. He is talked about a lot but not seen much. Harrison gets the most screen time of the older characters. It's rated 'PG-13' for sci-fi action and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes. I really, really liked this one and am looking forward to the next one. I would buy this on Blu-Ray.",10,5,30,18 December 2015
Unbroken," Makes You Proud to be an American
","I saw 'Unbroken', starring Jack O'Connell-300:Rise of an Empire, Skins_tv; Takamasa Ishihara-a music composer in his first movie; Domhnall Gleeson-About Time, Dredd and Jai Courtney-A Good Day to Die Hard, Jack Reacher.This is based on a true story about an Olympic athlete named Louis Zamperini, who was captured by the Japanese, during WW2. It's directed by Angelina Jolie. Jack plays Louis, a young boy that was headed for trouble until he got interested in running track, and discovered that he was pretty good at it. He went on to compete in the Olympics and then joined the military, where he became a bombardier during WW2. Domhnall plays the pilot and Jai plays the co-pilot on his plane. After crashing in the Pacific ocean, they survive for 45 days before they are captured by the Japanese and taken to a P.O.W. camp. Takamasa is the leader of the camp and runs it with a tight bamboo cane-he likes to use it on unruly prisoners that dare to look him in the eye-guess what Jack does? He tries everything to break Jack, and his bravery and endurance are tested to the limits. It's an inspiring story and it has great acting from all the actors. It makes you proud and thankful to all the servicemen and women in our armed forces. FYI: As the end credits start, you learn what Louis did after the war and that he died this past year- 2014. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, brutality and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes. I would buy this on DVD.",7,12,28,25 December 2014
The Purge," Interesting Premise
","I saw 'The Purge', starring Ethan Hawke-Sinister, Training Day; Lena Headey-Game of Thrones-t.v., 300; Rhys Wakefield-Sanctum, Broken Hill and Edwin Hodge-Red Dawn-2012, Die Hard: With a Vengeance. This movie has an interesting premise. It takes place in the not-too-distant future of 2022, where crime rates are down, poverty levels are down, and the economy is on the rise. And, it's all due to the government's newly instated annual Purge. Every year at 7:00 p.m. on June 21st until 7:00 a.m. on June 22nd-for 12 hours-any and all crime is legalized,with a few exceptions. During this time period, anyone can commit any crime, without any interference from police or medical personnel. The Purge, at least according to this movie, helps people release their pent-up anger and resentment that has been festering all year long-one person is overheard saying, 'I can't wait to kill my boss, he deserves it!' Of course, if you do not want to participate, you can stay indoors until it's over. Ethan plays just such a person, and it might be because he sells home protection services for a living. You know, with steel doors and windows that come down to lock up your house. Lena plays his wife. Everything is set for their annual Purge; the house is locked down, when Edwin shows up at their doorsteps being chased by a Purge hungry group led by Rhys. After Edwin gains access to the house, Rhys demands he be returned to them so they can Purge all over Edwin. The problem is should the Cleaver family give up a total stranger to be killed, just to prevent the Purge hungry clan from attacking them? As I said earlier, it's an interesting premise. It's rated 'R' for the violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 25 minutes. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,0,2,7 June 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Good Sequel But Leaves You Hanging
","I saw 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire', starring Jennifer Lawrence-X- Men: First Class, The Bill Engvall Show-t.v.; Josh Hutcherson-Red Dawn- 2012, RV; Liam Hemsworth-The Expendables 2, The Last Song; Philip Seymour Hoffman-Moneyball, The Big Lebowski and Donald Sutherland- Horrible Bosses, Reign Over Me.This is the second in the series that is based on a book trilogy about young people fighting to the death in an annual series of games. The third book will be made into two movies, a part 1 & part 2. Jennifer and Josh return as the latest champions who won the 74th annual Hunger Games. Just like a Miss America Pageant winner, they are paraded around the country side on a victory tour. Liam is still the true love of Jennifer back home, but she has to act like she is in love with Josh and promote the propaganda for the President, Donald, or face stiff consequences-he threatens to kill her family, friends and even the whole district that she is from, if she does not cooperate. Philip takes the newly vacant job of being the games controller. Donald had the last one killed for his incompetence in letting Jennifer survive the last games. Donald wants Jennifer dead because he fears that the peasants will start a rebellion if they have too much hope in her. It was a pretty good sequel except for the ending; it just stops suddenly, which I know was probably their intention in setting up the next installment. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 26 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,20,22 November 2013
Godzilla," Great Reboot But Slow Start
","I saw 'Godzilla' starring Bryan Cranston-Breaking Bad_t.v., Malcolm in the Middle_t.v.; Aaron Taylor-Johnson-Kick-Ass in the Kick-Ass movies, Savages, Elizabeth Olsen-Oldboy, Silent House and David Strathairn- Alphas_t.v., the Bourne Identity movies. FYI: Aaron is playing Pietro Maximoff and Elizabeth is playing Wanda Maximoff in the next Avengers movie.This is a reboot of the Godzilla franchise and it's a lot better than the last one that had Matthew Broderick in it, back in 1998. First of all, Godzilla actually looks like the Godzilla that we all know and love. Secondly, there are some good monster fights-yes, there are other giant monsters that Godzilla tangles with in this one. This year is also the 60th anniversary of Godzilla-the first movie was in 1954. My only complaint was that it was a little slow getting to the good stuff-it was about 45 minutes to an hour before the big G even shows up. Anyway, the movie starts about 15 years ago with Bryan as a scientist in Japan that is working on a nuclear reactor. He spots trouble but, of course, nobody will listen to him and after a small disaster, the government covers it up. Jump to the present and Bryan is still trying to prove his theories but is considered a nut-job. Aaron plays his son, who is in the military and Elizabeth plays Aaron's wife. David is in charge of the military forces that try to control the giant monster battle royale. The monster action covers a lot of geography, including Japan, Hawaii, California and Nevada. It's rated 'PG-13' for the creature violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,4,8,16 May 2014
Life," Alien Lite
","I saw 'Life', starring Jake Gyllenhaal-Nocturnal Animals, End of Watch; Ryan Reynolds-Deadpool, The Proposal; Rebecca Ferguson-The Girl on the Train, Mission:Impossible_Rogue Nation and Hiroyuki Sanada-The Last Ship_tv, The Wolverine.This is a sci_fi thriller that has some similarities to the classic movie, Alien. I guess you could call it Alien Lite. Jake, Ryan, Rebecca and Hiroyoki are 4 of the 6 crew members aboard an international space station that are collecting samples from the red planet, Mars. What they discover is far worse than anything they figured on. It is a microscopic, single_celled organism that begins growing rapidly and it decides to take over the ship, using the present crew members as lunch. The creature is given the nickname of Calvin and he has the body of a squid-with all the tentacles-and the face of one of the creatures from Alien. This extraterrestrial life form is believed to have caused the extinction of all life on Mars. After several unsuccessful attempts at exterminating Calvin fail, the crew members decide that they must keep Calvin from reaching Earth, at any costs. It's got a good cast and plenty of suspense but just not much originality, as far as the plot goes. It's rated 'R' for language, sci_fi violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",7,2,7,26 March 2017
Deadpool," Captures Essence of the Character Perfectly
","I saw 'Deadpool', starring Ryan Reynolds-Green Lantern, Blade:Trinity; Moreana Baccarin-Gotham_tv, Spy; Ed Skrein-The Transporter Refueled, Game Of Thrones_tv; Gina Carano-In The Blood, Haywire and T.J. Miller- Transformers:Age of Extinction, Cloverfield. This is the first super hero movie of 2016 and they knocked it out of the park. They really captured the spirit of the comic book character that made his first appearance back in 1991 in New Mutants #98. From the opening credits, you can tell this is going to be a different kind of super hero movie. Ryan plays Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, aka The Merc with a mouth. He got that last nickname because he is always making jokes; sort of like Spider-Man on speed. Ryan also played Wade Wilson in X-Men:Origins Wolverine. Of course, this being the origin of Deadpool, you learn how he became Deadpool, including how he got the name. Moreana plays Ryan's girlfriend and T.J. is his friend that also runs the local bar that Ryan hangs out at. Ryan is a former special forces mercenary that finds out he has Cancer and gets an invitation to participate in an experimental procedure to cure it. Ed is the administrator of the so-called cure, which does cure the Cancer and gives him the healing factor of Wolverine, but in the process, it mutates his body into a Freddy Krueger look-a-like. Ed and his lab assistant, Gina, have plans of turning Ryan into a super slave for the highest bidder but Ryan doesn't plan on cooperating. There are several cameos, including a couple of X-Men and Stan Lee pops up in a strip club. There is a scene after the end credits so don't leave too soon. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity, so do not take the little impressionable children to this one- and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",9,5,17,12 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," If You Like Bond....
","I saw 'Kingsman:The Secret Service', starring Colin Firth-The King's Speech, Mamma Mia!; Taron Egerton-Testament of Youth, The Smoke_tv; Sofia Boutella-Streetdance 2, Dance Challenge; Samuel L. Jackson-Nick Fury in almost all of the Marvel movies, Unbreakable and Michael Caine- Alfred in the Dark Knight movies, On Deadly Ground.This is based on a comic book series called The Secret Service and is directed by Matthew Vaughn-X-Men:First Class, Kick-Ass, Layer Cake. If you like Bond, James Bond, then you should love this one-I know I do and I did. Colin plays a Kingsman, a secret agent that works for her majesty's secret service in London. They work out of a tailor shop- anyone remember The Man From U.N.C.L.E.? FYI: There is a new movie based on that old t.v. show that is coming out in August. Michael plays the leader of the Kingsman and starts up a recruitment drive after their ranks are seriously depleted. Colin sponsors Taron, and all the candidates have to go through some rigorous training and learn how to use all kinds of Bondian gadgets; exploding lighters, guns that shoot different types of ammunition, bullet-proof umbrellas and of course, the blade in the shoe gimmick that was used so well in From Russia With Love. And what would a good spy movie be without a good villain? Samuel plays that part and he has it covered, with a speech impediment-he talks with a lisp-and he also hates violence-he actually gets sick at the sight of blood. Samuel's master plan is to kill most of the population; he thinks thinning the herd will be better for the planet and the eco system. Sofia plays Samuel's enforcer that goes by the name of Gazelle- mainly because of the way she moves and she has prosthetic sharp blades for legs, which she uses quite often-evidently, she has no problem with the sight of blood. There is a lot of humor along with the tributes to everything that is Bond and the music is good, too-I remember hearing some Lynyrd Skynyrd during the church massacre scene. Oh yeah, see if you recognize Professor Arnold, one of the first people that is kidnapped by Samuel. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and sexual content-including some nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes. I am a big Bond fan and really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,2,9,13 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," Deteriorating Sequel
","I saw 'The Hangover Part 3', starring Bradley Cooper-Silver Linings Playbook, All About Steve, Zack Galifianakis-The Campaign, Into the Wild, Ken Jeong-Community-t.v., All About Steve and John Goodman-Argo, Community-t.v..This is supposedly the last of the trilogy. The second movie was basically a copy of the first one and it went downhill in the laughs-it was funny but not as funny. This one deteriorates even more so. Zack has a turn for the worst after a giraffe incident and a death in the family so Bradley and the rest of the Wolf Pack decide to give him an intervention, which includes a trip to a special center in Arizona. John sidetracks them and messes things up for the boys. It seems that he is looking for Ken and he believes that the Wolf Pack can find Ken, since they have a past with him. Their search begins in Tijuana, Mexico and ends up in Las Vegas, where it all started. Not so hilarious hi-jinks ensue-there are some funny parts but the original one is still the best one. There was some good music to be heard; I remember hearing Billy Joel, Santana, Phil Collins-In the Air Tonight- and Black Sabbath-NIB. It's rated 'R' for violence, language, nudity and drug content and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Null,0,2,24 May 2013
Green Book," Unlikely Friendship
","I saw 'Green Book', starring Viggo Mortensen-Eastern Promises, the Lord of the Rings movies; Mahershala Ali-Luke Cage_tv, House of Cards_tv; Linda Cardellini-Hunter Killer, Avengers:Age of Ultron and Sebastian Maniscalco-Tag, The House.
This is based on a true story of an unlikely friendship between an Italian_American bouncer and an African_American classical pianist in the 1960's. Viggo plays the bouncer that is between jobs and is hired for 2 months to drive Mahershala, the pianist, on his first concert tour of the deep south. I say unlikely friendship because Viggo is an uncultured racist that uses his fists to settle matters and Mahershala is a sophisticated professional with a doctorate that does not believe in violence. Viggo does have principles that he lives by and he does need the money, so it is interesting to see their views and relationship grow into a friendship. Linda is Viggo's wife and Sebastian is one of Viggo's relatives, neither one of which thinks Viggo will last the whole trip. For those unfamiliar with the era, there were lots of racist ideas about places African_Americans could eat, sleep, buy things, etc. Of course, this would be a problem on the tour with Mahershala-he could perform music for white audiences but could not use the restroom in the same building. The name of the movie-Green Book-refers to 'The Negro Motorist Green Book', which was an actual guide to lodgings, restaurants and businesses that would service African_Americans. It was published from 1936-1966. During the end credits, the actual people are shown and you are told what happened to them after the events of the movie.
It's rated 'PG-13' for language-including racial epithets-smoking and violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",8,1,2,26 November 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Stylish & Gruesome
","I saw 'John Wick:Chapter 2', starring Keanu Reeves-Knock Knock, the Matrix movies; Ian McShane-The Brothers Grimsby, Death Race_2008; Riccardo Scamarcio-Burnt, Loose Cannons; Common-Run All Night, Date Night and Laurence Fishburne-Black_ish_tv, the Matrix movies.This is a sequel to the 2014 action hit and they have upped the action here. FYI: I have heard that there will be a third one and this one sets it up nicely. Keanu returns as the trying-to-retire hit man that keeps running into people that don't want him to. Ian is sort of the keeper and enforcer of the hit man rules that all hit men have to follow. He lets people know about safe havens too, where no violence is allowed at all, under penalty of expulsion from the International Hit Man Club and it usually ends in death for the person, too. Riccardo wants Keanu to kill someone for him-he has a marker on Keanu and if Keanu does the hit, then Keanu will be a free man. Of course, things get more complicated, more violent, more guns blazing, well, you get the idea. Common is the bodyguard of the person that Keanu is supposed to take out and Laurence is the head of a group of hit men that disguise themselves as street people-like homeless people or street beggars. At one point, there is an open contract on Keanu for 7 million dollars and other assassins come at him from every angle. The stunts and fights are fantastic and I don't see how some of the stunt men weren't seriously hurt during the filming. It is not for everyone-Keanu kills several opponents using only an ordinary pencil-but it is my kind of movie; stylish and gruesome. It's rated 'R' for violence, language and some brief nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I loved it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Null,7,16,10 February 2017
Annihilation," Alien Invasion
","I saw 'Annihilation', starring Natalie Portman-The Thor movies, the Star Wars movies; Jennifer Jason Leigh-The Hateful Eight, Backdraft; Gina Rodriguez-Jane the Virgin_tv, Deepwater Horizon and Oscar Isaac-The Star Wars movies, X-Men:Apocalypse.
This is a sci-fi movie that is based on the first book of the 'Southern Reach' trilogy, written by Jeff VanderMeer. The movie starts off with something hitting a lighthouse-a meteor? a spaceship?-that causes an ever expanding shimmer effect to spread outwards, at a slow pace. Things that go into the shimmer, do not come back, neither animals, people or even radio signals. Natalie & Oscar are a married couple and Oscar is chosen to go on the next mission inside. He is in the military, as was Natalie, but she has retired and is now teaching. Of course, no one returns from that mission, either. Then, one year later, just as they are preparing their next incursion, Oscar appears at home. But, he is disoriented and knows nothing about how he got home and then proceeds to have some kind of episode-he starts spitting up blood and passes out-and is taken to a medical center-notice, I didn't say hospital? Jennifer is in charge of the center-it's not a regular hospital-and tells Natalie about the shimmer and her husbands part in exploring it. Natalie decides that she wants to be on the next excursion into Area X-the new name sounds more official than the shimmer-Gina tags along on the all girl team. Each one is a scientist in their own right; a biologist, psychologist, etc. What they find is both beautiful and puzzling, at the same time. Plants and animals seem to be mutated into hybrid combinations of different species-there is a crocodile with sharks' teeth-and they find answers to what is really going on inside the shimmer, I mean, Area X. Is it some freak space virus or maybe an alien invasion? Think about the name of the movie and it could go either way.
It's rated 'R' for violence, language, bloody images and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.
I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.",6,2,9,25 February 2018
Minions," Good Origin Story With Great Music
","I saw 'Minions', starring the voices of Sandra Bullock-The Heat, Demolition Man; Jon Hamm-Mad Men_tv, We Were Soldiers; Michael Keaton-Need For Speed, Jackie Brown; Allison Janney-Mom_tv, The Help and Pierre Coffin-the Despicable Me movies, where he does all the voices of all the Minions.This is a spin off from the Despicable Me movies. Plus, it is an origin story of the popular Minions, the lovable little yellow henchmen to the super villain, Gru. In fact, it tells how they came to work for Gru-and a young Gru does make an appearance. It tells how the Minions-all of which are voiced by Pierre-whose sole mission in life is to serve an evil villain, go searching for evil bosses throughout the years, starting in prehistoric times and continuing up to 1968. That's when they hear about the world's first evil villainess, Sandra, at a Super Villain Convention; sort of like a Comic Con for villains. Three Minions, Stuart, Kevin & Bob, are chosen to strike out on the search-I guess they figured it would be easier if they all didn't go-and they run into Michael & Allison, a truly dysfunctional family that gives them a ride to the convention. Sandra has a contest for her next group of henchmen and guess who wins? That's right, the Three Stooges.....I mean Stuart, Kevin & Bob and their first job is to steal the crown jewels from Queen Elizabeth 11 in London for Sandra. Jon plays Sandra's husband, who also enjoys inflicting a bit of torture every now & again, when needed. I guess it depends on how much you like the Minions-I do a lot-on whether or not you will like this movie. Some people don't like the way they talk-it is kind of a mixture of several languages, including Spanish, French and lots of others. Every so often, you will hear an English word thrown in for good measure. FYI: I loved the soundtrack. They have lots of good music, both the original artists singing and some with the Minions -or other characters-doing the honors. Just off the top of my head, I remember hearing songs by The Rolling Stones, The Turtles, The Box Tops, The Doors, The Kinks, The Spencer Davis Group, The Monkees, The Who, Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix! As the end credits start, there are some scenes and don't leave early because at the very end is a Beatles musical number involving the whole cast. It's rated 'PG' for action and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,12,22,10 July 2015
Incredibles 2," If You Liked The Original...
","I saw 'Incredibles 2', starring the voices of Craig T. Nelson-Book Club, Turner & Hooch; Holly Hunter-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, Raising Arizona; Bob Odenkirk-Better Call Saul_tv, Let's Go to Prison; Catherine Keener-Get Out, Captain Phillips and Samuel L. Jackson-The Hitman's Bodyguard, Changing Lanes.
This is a sequel to the 2014 hit and it takes place right after the first one ended-you can also tell that it takes place in the 1960's because of tv shows Johnny Quest & Outer Limits being seen on tvs. If you liked the original movie, then you should enjoy this one, too. Super heroes are not in favor. In fact, it's against the law to be super heroing in public. Craig, Holly and their friend Samuel-as well as Craig & Holly's kids-have to perform their super deeds from the sidelines, at the risk of going to jail. That's when Bob and his sister Catherine come to them with a plan to legalize super heroes again. The only problem is that it involves just Holly working alone-until the public's trust is won back-and Craig has to become a stay-at-home dad, watching the kids. Their new baby, Jack-Jack, is also developing his own set of powers and it becomes a handful for Craig. The main villain is called Screenslaver because they use hypnotism to enslave people. There is a minor villain called The Underminer that is seen at the beginning of the movie-he digs underground using a machine shaped like a rocket with a spiraling cone. In fact, after the end credits, there is a quick scene of The Underminer digging up from the bottom of the screen.
It's rated 'PG' for action and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,3,8,17 June 2018
Spectre," Everything A Bond Fan Craves
","I saw 'Spectre', starring Daniel Craig-Besides the last 3 Bond movies, Cowboys & Aliens, Lara Croft:Tomb Raider; Monica Bellucci-Shoot 'Em Up, The Matrix Reloaded; Dave Bautista-Guardians of the Galaxy, Riddick; Lea Seydoux-Mission:Impossible_Ghost Protocol, Inglourious Basterds and Christoph Waltz-Horrible Bosses 2, Inglourious Basterds. This is the 24th Bond film and Daniel Craig's 4th-with rumors flying about that this might be his last. Personally, I have suspicions that it could be just a ploy to get more money, myself, but I could be wrong. But I kind of doubt it, with a clue being that Daniel is a producer of this film, meaning he has an interest in it being successful. We will just have to wait and see, of course. Anyway, this is the best Daniel has done in the series, at least in my opinion, because it has all the elements a Bond fan craves. Fantastic stunts, great car chases, beautiful Bond girls/women, suitably tough henchmen-in the Oddjob/Jaws vein-and an equally suitably villainous villain. This film ties the previous 3 Bond films-Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace & Skyfall- together with a fantastic conspiracy and the introduction of Spectre as the organization trying to take over the world. FYI:There was no mention in this film but in the original movies, Spectre stood for Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge & Extortion. Daniel receives a video from the former M-made before she died, obviously-that leads to Mr. White-remember him from Casino Royale?-and then continues on to his daughter Lea. After that, he interviews Monica, the wife of a member of Spectre, that leads to his meeting with Christoph-called Franz Oberhauser here but could he go by another name, like maybe, Oh I don't know, maybe Ernst Stavro Blofeld? He has a henchman named Oddjob....I mean Hinx, played by Dave, who does not speak very much, letting his actions speak for him. Well, he does get to say one 4 letter word, near the end. As all of this is going on, there is also an effort by a government bureaucrat to shut down the 00 program; he thinks it is obsolete when you can use today's technology to replace the agents, but clearly, he doesn't know Bond. A lot of the action sequences look like Daniel is actually doing them, but I'm sure that a stunt man helped out just a little. The only complaint I can think of is with the opening song; It is called 'Writing's On The Wall' and it is sung by Sam Smith. The music is not bad but I don't care for his falsetto style of singing. I know, it is a minor complaint, but I'm a big Bond fan and I love the movies and the music. It's rated 'PG-13' for action, violence, disturbing images, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 28 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,4,14,7 November 2015
Joy," Uneven Comedy/Drama
","I saw 'Joy', starring Jennifer Lawrence-The Hunger Games movies, Garden Party; Robert De Niro-The Intern, Wag the Dog; Bradley Cooper-American Sniper, Silver Linings Playbook; Edgar Ramirez-Point Break_2015, Deliver Us From Evil and Virginia Madsen-The Haunting in Connecticut, Sideways.This movie is based on a true story about Joy Mangano, the woman who invented the Miracle Mop back in 1990. She also had a few other inventions but the mop is the one that got her started. Jennifer plays Joy. She grew up in Long Island and her family were the perfect definition of a dysfunctional family. Jennifer lives with her grandmother, her mother, Virginia and her ex husband, Edgar. Jennifer and Edgar have the perfect divorce; they get along better as friends than they did when they were married. Her father, Robert is having problems with his girlfriend and decides to move in, too. Robert and Virginia do not get along at all and they have verbal fights a lot. Virginia lies around watching soap operas all day; they do use some real soap opera stars in cameos. I know of Laura Wright and Susan Lucci and I'm sure there were others that I did not know. Jennifer's always trying to come up with an invention that will get her out of her dreadful life and the movie tells about her difficulties in reaching her goals, including developing an actual workable product, getting it produced in mass quantities and then getting it out to the public on cable channels, such as QVC and HSN. Bradley plays an ad executive that gives Jennifer her first TV break. It does have some good actors in it but it is a little uneven between being a comedy and being a drama; it is a little bit of both but not enough of either. It's rated 'PG-13' for some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 4 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are interested in the subject matter, it would be a good rental.",6,1,5,2 January 2016
The Nice Guys," Buddy Cop Movie Without The Cops
","I saw 'The Nice Guys', starring Russell Crowe-The Man With The Iron Fists, L.A. Confidential; Ryan Gosling-Gangster Squad, Young Hercules_tv; Kim Basinger-L.A. Confidential, Wayne's World 2; Margaret Qualley-The Leftovers_tv, Palo Alto and Matt Bomer-White Collar_tv, Chuck_tv.This is a nice throwback to the old buddy/cop movies, only these are not cops. It's directed by Shane Black and if you don't know his name, you should. He had his influential hand in some great action movies; he wrote Iron Man 3, Long Kiss Goodnight, The Last Boy Scout and the Lethal Weapon movies, and he directed Iron Man 3 and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. That is a nice little resume. The movie takes place in 1977 Los Angeles. Russell plays a guy that is hired by people, just to beat up people-that is actually how he makes a living. Margaret hires Russell to scare off some people that are looking for her. Ryan is a private detective-the world's worst, according to his own daughter-that is hired to find Margaret by Kim, who also happens to be Margaret's mother. Matt plays a dangerous hit man that is after Margaret, and his name is John Boy- anyone remember the Walton's? It has both action and comedy. I don't want to give too much away but other plot elements involve a dead porn star named Misty Mountains and a film that exposes a government conspiracy involving the Detroit automakers and their polluting of the environment. Ryan even gets to do his best impression of Bud Abbott. It's rated 'R' for violence, language, drug use and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. I really liked this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,3,8,20 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Adrenaline Rush
","I saw 'Mad Max:Fury Road', starring Tom Hardy-Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, Sucker Punch; Charlize Theron-Prometheus, Reindeer Games; Nicholas Hoult-Beast in the X-Men movies including the next one, Warm Bodies and Hugh Keays-Byrne-Farscape_tv, Mad Max_1979.This is an action packed reboot of the Mad Max movies from 1979-1985, that starred Mel Gibson, and no, he does not make an appearance in this new one. It is directed by the same man that directed the original 3 movies from 30 years ago, George Miller. In this reboot, Tom plays Max, an ex-cop living in the dark, apocalyptic world of the not too distant future, where there is a shortage of resources, mostly gas and water. Hugh is the man in charge of a place called the citadel, where he dishes out supplies very sparingly and he also keeps a small harem of Victoria's Secret super models as breeding materials. A couple of them were real VS models. Most of Hugh's underlings look like bald-headed, white paint covered cannibals, and the movie starts with a group of them capturing Tom. Charlize drives one of the gas tanker trucks for Hugh but decides to steal Hugh's breeding girls and head for a safe haven in the dessert, where she grew up. Nicholas plays one of the white paint covered underlings sent to retrieve Hugh's stolen property and he takes Tom along as his personal living blood bank-he has Tom strapped to the hood of his car with an iv needle leading back to himself. Pretty soon, Tom and Charlize team-up while trying to avoid all the supped up cars, trucks, motorcycles and other assorted vehicles that are in hot pursuit. One thing that I really enjoyed was that the stunts are about 80% real stunts-not CGI-although there is some CGI used; Charlize is missing an arm and I don't think that they really cut it off for this movie. Oh yeah, I also liked how the bad guys had their own traveling music along with them. There were literally people playing drums and guitars on one of the vehicles, as they were barreling through the dessert fighting. The stunts are fantastic and I don't see how some of the stunt people survived some of the crashes that occurred. This movie is so action packed that it is an adrenaline rush! It's rated 'R' for violence, disturbing images and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,3,7,15 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Moving But Bloody
","I saw 'Hacksaw Ridge', starring Andrew Garfield-the Amazing Spider-Man movies, Lions For Lambs; Teresa Palmer-Lights Out, The Sorcerer's Apprentice; Sam Worthington-Everest, Avatar and Vince Vaughn-The Internship, Mr. & Mrs. Smith.This is a WW2 movie directed by Mel Gibson and is based on the true story of Desmond Doss, a 7th Day Adventist that was the first conscientious objector in American history to receive the Medal of Honor. It was filmed in Australia-I guess Mel likes filming in his home country-and centers on the 1945 Battle of Okinawa. Andrew plays Desmond, who enlisted in the Army because he just wanted to serve his country, but not have to kill anyone. He wanted to be a medic and wanted to save lives but he would not carry a gun. Teresa is his girlfriend back in Virginia-they eventually married-and Andrew even went through a court martial because he refused to carry a weapon. Sam plays his Captain and Vince is his Sergeant, who along with just about everybody else, thought Andrew was just a plain old coward for not carrying a gun. The battle scenes are pretty graphic and grisly. Remember the opening of Saving Private Ryan? The last half of the movie is like that one scene, only amp-ed up. The scenes of Andrew rescuing the wounded soldiers are very heroic and it's estimated that he rescued somewhere around 75 men. As the end credits start, you get to hear from the actual people that survived, including Desmond Doss, and what happened to them afterwards. It is a bloody but moving story. It's rated 'R' for graphic war violence and grisly, bloody images and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes. I would buy this one on DVD.",7,2,11,4 November 2016
Warcraft," Humans vs Orcs
","I saw 'Warcraft', starring Travis Fimmel-Vikings_tv, The Experiment; Paula Patton-Mission Impossible:Ghost Protocol, Deja Vu; Dominic Cooper- Howard Stark in the Marvel movies & TV shows, From Hell; Ben Foster-The Mechanic_2011, The Punisher_2004 and Daniel Wu-Into the Badlands_tv, The Man With the Iron Fists.This movie is based on a video game and as I have mentioned on numerous occasions before, I do not play video games. I have nothing against them, I just never had the spare time to play them, what with other interests taking up my time-which I'm sure some people would think were just as absurd time wasters as anything else that people occupy their time with, but I digress........ I CAN tell you about the movie, though. There are humans living in a kingdom called Azeroth and they are ruled by Dominic/King Wrynn. There are other types of species surrounding them, including elves and human-looking sparkly eyed creatures. Travis/Lothar is Dominic's brother-in-law and also toughest knight-in his spare time, he flies around on a bird/horse type of animal that also can handle himself in a fight. Then there are the Orcs. They are bigger than their human counterparts-and they have tusks-and they come from another planet-which is dying, by the way-through a magic portal created by Daniel/Gul'Dan to colonize our planet as their new home. Daniel uses the life force of other Orcs or humans as fuel for his magic. Ben/Medivh is Dominic's sorcerer that comes from a group of sorcerers that try to maintain order. Paula/Garona is a half Orc half human hybrid-I don't think they ever mention her back story, of how she became a half breed but I'm sure fans of the video game will know it. The motion capture characters and all the other CGI effects look really good and the battles are pretty fantastic. Wait until you see an Orc pick up a horse and throw it, knocking down opponents like bowling pins! The movie ends as if there will be more sequels, depending on box office, of course. It's rated 'PG-13' for intense violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",7,0,0,10 June 2016
Me Before You," Real Tearjerker
","I saw 'Me Before You', starring Emilia Clarke-Game of Thrones_tv, Terminator Genisys; Sam Claflin-The Hunger Games movies, Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides; Charles Dance-Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Game of Thrones_tv and Janet McTeer-Insurgent, The Woman in Black.This is a romantic movie that will have it's target audience-ladies- grabbing for a tissue. Yep, a real tearjerker. Sam plays a banker from a wealthy family. He has a girlfriend-not Emilia-but looses her after he is hit by a motorcycle and is paralyzed from the neck down. I guess she was the shallow type, because she ends up marrying Sam's best friend. Emilia is hired by Sam's parents, Charles & Janet, to help take care of Sam; nothing too physical, just mostly to talk to him and keep him company. Emilia has a boyfriend but you can tell that they are not meant to be together and he won't be around at the end of the movie. Sam was real active physically before his accident so he is really depressed now. He even tries to kill himself-which is hard to do when you are a quadriplegic-and he tells his parents that he will go to Switzerland to do the job right, but he gets talked into waiting 6 months before saying his final goodbyes. That is where Emilia comes in. Emilia has a perky personality, always talking and she dresses in bright & outlandish styles of clothing, and she hopes to change Sam's mind about his death choice-when she eventually finds out about it. Like most romantic movies, they don't get along at first but soon..... It's rated 'PG-13' for thematic elements and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes. It's a descent movie for what it is, not one that I would buy on DVD-I'm not the target audience, remember?-but a good rental, if you like these types of movies.",6,0,5,11 June 2016
The Great Gatsby," Lavish Looking Remake
","I saw 'The Great Gatsby', starring Leonardo DiCaprio-This Boy's Life, Growing Pains-t.v., Tobey Maguire-The Spider-Man movies, This Boy's Life, Carey Mulligan-Drive, Public Enemies and Joel Edgerton-Zero Dark Thirty, Smokin' Aces.This is about the second or third remake of the book written by F. Scott Fetzgerald. It takes place in the 1920's and revolves around the rich lifestyles of 2 men, Leonardo and Joel. Tobey is a would be writer and stock broker, a good job to have in the 1920's and he narrates the movie. Tobey lives next door to Leonardo/Gatsby and becomes friends. Carey is Tobey's cousin and is married to Joel. Leonardo has a past with Carey and wants to continue it, but it's kind of hard, with her being married to Joel and all. Tobey has a past with Joel, they went to school together, but Joel is now a womanizer that openly cheats on Carey. The look of the movie is authentic except for one thing; the music. Most of it is alright but there are touches of rap mixed in, compliments of Jay-Z, and you know how I just love rap. It's rated 'PG-13' for sexual content-but no nudity and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",Null,0,2,10 May 2013
13 Hours," Patriotic and Sad
","I saw '13 Hours:The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi' starring, John Krasinski-Aloha, Leatherheads; James Badge Dale-The Walk, World War Z; Max Martini-Fifty Shades of Grey, The Unit_tv and Matt Letscher-Her, The Mack of Zorro.This is based on a true story about a small group of military men fighting an Alamo type fight-a few men holding off big forces-in Benghazi, Libya on September 11th of 2012. They like that date-9/11-in that part of the world. It's directed by Michael Bay, who knows his way around an action movie-The Transformer movies, Bad Boys movies, Armageddon and The Rock, just to name a few he had a hand in. Matt plays the American ambassador to Libya that is stranded at the embassy when it is attacked. John, James and Max are GRS soldiers used as security for the C.I.A. that are stationed about a mile away. If you have never heard of the GRS-I know I haven't before this movie, it stands for Global Response Staff-they are the secret soldiers in the sub title of the movie. They are made up of special-ops guys from different branches of the military, such as SEALS, Army and Marines. From about 5:00 pm until around 6:00 am the next day-13 hours-the GRS helped save lives and fight off enemy soldiers until help could arrive. Not all survive but a lot more of the enemy bite the dust in truly heroic fashion. Some of the fighting is pretty graphic; I remember one of the GRS walking around after a fierce battle with his arm almost detached, just hanging by a few tendons and muscles. Most of the men have families back home and all they can think about is just getting back to their homes safely and seeing their loved ones again. I don't know about anyone else but it made me feel patriotic and thankful of the men & women who give their all for our country. It's rated 'R' for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 24 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,37,78,15 January 2016
Sully," Behind the Story You Know
","I saw 'Sully', starring Tom Hanks-Bridge of Spies, Turner & Hooch; Aaron Eckhart-London Has Fallen, The Rum Diary; Laura Linney-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:Out of the Shadows, The Truman Show and Mike O'Malley- Concussion, Glee_tv.This movie tells the incredible true story of how Chesley Sullenberger, a pilot that landed a plane that had lost both engines after hitting a flock of geese about 30 seconds after takeoff, on the Hudson river in New York on January 15, 2009, without any casualties-all 155 people on board survived! Now you may be familiar with the story but this movie is based on the book 'Highest Duty', written by Sullenberger and tells the behind the scenes story, you may not know. It's directed by Clint Eastwood-I think this is something like his 35th movie to direct. Tom plays Sully-Sullenberger's nickname-the man who became a hero to New York and most of the country after his heroic landing. Laura plays his wife and Aaron plays the co-pilot. The National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation almost immediately-the chairman is played by Mike. They were concerned with any human error that may have caused the forced water landing; had Tom or Aaron been drinking? Drugs? Family problems? They ran computer simulations trying to see if the plane could have made a safe landing or not. Tom & Aaron were just doing their jobs-not to mention that they saved everyone on board-and now they were having to worry about their reputations and the possibility of even losing their careers. It is an interesting story. It's rated 'PG-13' for peril and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed it-it's hard for Tom Hanks to make a bad movie-but it's not one that I would buy on DVD-one viewing was fine. It would make a great rental, though.",7,1,2,10 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," Good Story With Plenty Of Action
","I saw 'Alien:Covenant', starring Michael Fassbender-Assassin's Creed, Steve Jobs; Katherine Waterston-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Steve Jobs; Billy Crudup-Spotlight, Mission:Impossible 3 and Danny McBride-Rock the Kasbah, Eastbound & Down_tv. This is a sequel to the 2012 Prometheus and the second in a trilogy that takes place before the 1979 original Alien. It is directed by Ridley Scott who directed both Prometheus and the first Alien. It is more action packed than Prometheus and you get plenty of chest busting scenes for your money. Michael plays an android on a space ship heading for a distant planet in hopes of starting a new colony. The ship has 15 crew members and 2,000 colonists on board, all in sleep mode except for Michael, who is keeping an eye on things. After a cosmic storm wakes up the crew members, a message is intercepted and decided by the ship's captain, Billy, to investigate-never a good idea in these types of movies. They discover more than they bargained for; besides little alien creatures attacking from all sides, they find another android that looks just like their very own Michael. And he has some es-plainin' to do. Katherine is next in command-you know they will soon need someone-and she plays a tough female lead, in the vein of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character. Danny plays the pilot of the ship and by the way, the name of the ship is the Covenant-which means an agreement or a promise. It's rated 'R' for sci-fi violence, bloody images, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes. I thought it was a good story with plenty of action and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",7,2,13,19 May 2017
Draft Day," Sports Fans' Movie
","I saw 'Draft Day', starring Kevin Costner-Man of Steel, Malibu Hot Summer; Jennifer Garner-Dallas Buyers Club, Alias_t.v.; Denis Leary-The Amazing Spider-Man, Demolition Man and Frank Langella-Superman Returns, Masters of the Universe.If you know me, I am not a football fan, so I'm sure that if you are a fan, you would probably like it more than I did. This is a sports fans' movie. There are cameos-some that even I recognized, such as Jim Brown- and there are clips of former football greats from their hey-days. It's directed by Ivan Reitman, who also directed No Strings Attached, Kindergarten Cop, the 2 Ghostbuster movies and one of my favorite comedies, Stripes, among a few others. The movie covers about 12 hours and starts off about 12 hours before the NFL Draft Day picks are chosen- there is even a clock that counts down every so often on the screen. Kevin is the general manager of the Cleveland Browns that is also the man that picks his future football players. After, of course, weighing all other opinions from his team owner and boss, Frank, and his coach, Denis and anyone else that wants to put in their own two cents worth. Jennifer is his love interest that also knows as much about football as he does. The movie pretty much covers everything you would want to know about the process of picking the players. It's rated 'PG-13' for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are a football fan, you would probably love it. For me, it's a rental.",5,2,5,14 April 2014
The Martian," Lots of Talent But a Little Bland
","I saw 'The Martian', starring Matt Damon-Interstellar, True Grit_2010; Jessica Chastain-Interstellar, Zero Dark Thirty; Jeff Daniels-the Dumb & Dumber movies, Looper and Chiwetel Ejiofor-12 Years a Slave, Salt.This is a sci-fi movie based on the book by Andy Weir and directed by Ridley Scott-Prometheus, Blade Runner and Alien. It has a lot of talent lined up to make a good movie but it was a little on the bland side. While conducting experiments on Mars, Matt gets separated from his team and presumed dead. Jessica, the captain of the mission, rounds up everyone else and heads back home to Earth. Turns out that Matt was just knocked unconscious. The next mission to Mars isn't until about 4 years from now so Matt has to figure out how to survive that long. He has 30 days of food and supplies, which he can stretch a little, with all the other crew members now gone, but it won't last him 4 years. Man, it's a good thing that he is a botanist. Maybe he can figure out how to grow something. But then, he still needs water and someway to extend his battery power for things like air and a place to live in. Jeff plays the head of NASA and Chiwetel is trying to work out a plan to get Matt back home alive. While scrounging through his long gone fellow astronauts belongings, Matt does find some music but, unfortunately, it is nothing but disco music! Somebody better rescue him quick! FYI: The movie is being shown in 3D but it is not essential that it be seen in that version. It's rated 'PG-13' for language, injury images and some brief nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 14 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental-one viewing was good enough.",6,6,67,2 October 2015
Furious 7," Most Action-Packed in the Series
","I saw 'Furious Seven', starring Vin Diesel-Riddick, The Pacifier; Paul Walker-Brick Mansions, Pleasantville; Jason Statham-the Expendables movies, the Transporter movies; Dwayne Johnson-Hercules_2014, Get Smart_2008 and Kurt Russell-Death Proof, Vanilla Sky.People have said that this is the last in the Fast & Furious franchise, seeing as how Paul died during the filming of this one but I have a sneaking suspicion that there will be more, once they see how much the box office rakes in-it was very crowded at the 9:00 am showing that I went to and it is usually not very busy, that early in the morning. They had to use body doubles, including Paul's brothers, and CGI to finish the film and to be honest, I think they did a good job. I had a hard time telling the differences. The story starts right after number 6 ends. Jason plays the big brother of the villain from 6 and Jason is looking for revenge. Vin, Paul and the rest of the gang are all just taking it easy-Paul is even settled down with Jordana and child and driving a mini-van-when Jason comes looking for them, killing one team member and putting Dwayne in the hospital in the process. Kurt pops up as a government spook that knows Jason's background and offers Vin's team info on Jason, if Vin's team will help recover some kind of super computer spyware called 'God's Eye' for him. Of course there are lots of car stunts-cars parachuting out of planes and jumping between buildings- and fight scenes-Jason vs Dwayne, Jason vs Vin, Michelle vs Ronda-that will blow your socks off, if you are wearing any, and several cameos of previous Furious stars, like Lucas Black, and newcomers like Ronda Rousey, Tony Jaa and Iggy Azalea. All in all, I think this one is the most action packed, in the series. There is a song called 'See You Again' at the end and as the end credits start, 'For Paul' appears on screen and scenes with Paul from the previous movies are shown in a montage. It's rated 'PG-13' for violence, action, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",8,0,3,3 April 2015
