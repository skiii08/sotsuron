Blade Runner 2049," I'm glad I seen it, But...
","Far, Far, Far too long. trying to replicate (pun intended) the stunning vistas of the original s one thing, But to do so at every cut scene is unforgivable. If you just showed the scenes with that contained dialog, you would have a 40 minute move. The extra two hours is an attempt to grab onto everything that was great about 'Blade Runner',and failing. The incomprehensible motives of the Jared Leto's Niander Wallace are an unnecessary distraction from what is already disjointed and confusing script. You would wonder if David Bowie would have managed to make anything better out of him. I still give it 7/10, I'm glad I went to see it, But I wont be waiting with bated breath for the 5 reedits and the ultimate directors edition Blu-Ray box set.",7,2,6,12 October 2017
Foxcatcher," Carrell at His best
","It is quite a difficult film to watch, Overly long in places, The wrestling practice sessions ware far too arty. The grunting of men and squeaking of plimsolls on a wooden floor don't add to a good movie.Undoubtedly the acting is amazing,Tatum and Ruffalo are excellent in their respective rolls,But Carrell stole the show with his portrayal of DuPont and did his best work in the moments he just sat and brooded. I like the slow moving aspect of this movie, It works well in telling what is a very strange story .It wont be to everyones liking.Overall a good film, But not for someone looking for a sports movie, its not that.",6,0,2,9 January 2015
Jurassic World," Great Fun if You are under 12, Not much for the rest of Us.
","After the huge plot hole at the start I lost all love for this movie. Too much time is spent on the brooding older brother looking at teenage girls ( I know I'm not the intended audience ) But it gets real stale real quick. They should have spent a lot more time developing the park, You get a hint at what the park consists of, But only get to see a few of the attractions, Big fish tanks, Roaming Dino's ( That we have already seen in JP) and the obligatory T-Rex enclosure. The very thin plot of the absent aunt and divorcing parents added nothing. The moronic park owner? I wouldn't let him in charge of a doggy corner of a pet shop. The Military and Scientists were just Dino fodder, Waisted story lines. It should have been better . I like My big blockbusters, I want to be amazed, I wasn't.5 out of 10 is being generous. And that huge plot hole at the start??? Spoiler >>>>>>>>Why in gods name did they not just look at the security Tapes of the enclosure to see how and if Gigantor (I know that's not it's name ) Got out?And how did gigantor know that it was a tracking device that was implanted in it, Now I get He/She may have remembered that something was implanted in its body, But to know that it was an electrical tracking device? Come on?",5,0,3,19 June 2015
