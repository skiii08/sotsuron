Skyfall," End of a Cycle. New Formula, Ideas and Approach Needed. We want Bond Back¡¡¡
","I do love James Bond movies. As soon as the movie was released in Spain, I wanted to watch it. So, yesterday, after a light dinner with a friend, I went to the cinema. At first, I was extremely comfortable with the movie. A list of secret agents has fallen into the wrong hands, and Bond has to recover the list whatever the cost. M has her head on the line, so, she becomes ruthless and drives her agents into a coldblooded rampage of killing and destruction in order to get back the stolen list, including a very uncompassionate approach to her own agents if she believes they stand on the way to the mission's success. All starts with some scenes packed of good action in Turkey, where two MI6 agents pursue the bad guy, one of these agents being Bond. Finally, after a good chasing and some fights on top of a train, Bond is shot accidentally by the other agent (a pretty black woman) on M instructions, and Bond is considered missing in action, supposedly dead. Of Course, Bond is not dead, returns to duty after some colourful and self-destructive holydays in South America, where he drinks tequila shots with a scorpion on his hand(very nice scene), and is unleashed against the bad guys again, going to Shanghai to capture the mysterious bad guy who previously eluded capture in Turkey. We have some very good scenes of a shooting in a Chinese skyscraper, the appearance of a very beautiful Asian woman, a Macau prostitute, and some interesting moments in a strikingly beautiful and decadent Chinese casino with an arena full of Komodo Dragons and bad guys, which is great¡¡. Then, Bond sets sail with the beautiful Asian woman in a magnificent sailing yacht, and reaches an abandoned island where the bad guy (Javier Bardem) lives. The good part of the movie ends here. From now on, all loses credibility, does not stand scrutiny, and all is utterly ridiculous. A sensation of boredom invaded me and the rest of the audience. We do not hear any more about the list of agents, or any other tangible or meaningful plot. A bad guy with mommy issues for M, who feels betrayed by her just appears out of the blue, and all he wants is personal revenge. A bad guy with mommy issues is just unfit for a James Bond movie. We wanted to see a bad guy full of plans to control or destroy the world, with some intelligent design that Bond will try to thwart desperately in the last minute. However, we are just given a poor chap who calls M 'Mom' (I nearly jumped from my seat and puked when I heard this¡¡¡¡), suffers from Oedipus complex and feels betrayed, engaging in a sort of vengeful killing spree. From this moment the movie rapidly decays into unbearable nonsense, and feels almost like an insult. The end is just so bad¡¡¡¡ Basically Bond takes mommy (see M) to his ancestral home in Scotland in order to kill the bad guy with old hunting rifles. The Bad guy arrives with a bunch of thugs and a helicopter, torches the house, and then Bond kills the bad guy with a knife without fighting, M dies, and the movie ends. In order to compensate the very poor script and ending, a new M and a new Money Penny are given to us, setting the atmosphere for the next movie. Casino Royale was very good. Quantum of Solace was not so good. Skyfall is very bad. The decreasing quality of this franchise is evident. It does not work anymore and a new formula is desperately needed. The only good point is that we have got possibilities of a new and fresh start for the series; we have a new Money Penny (The Pretty Black Woman who accidentally shot Bond), and a new M (Ralph Fiennes, who could make a good M). So, I hope they make something sensible and good next time. This movie was the end of a cycle for the Daniel Craig-Judi Dench franchise. A new approach and new ideas must be developed, and we all want back the true James Bond, and not the big BS they gave us this time.",1,93,179,3 November 2012
Saving Private Ryan," Could someone please kill Private Ryan¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
","I dislike the movie for the following reasons.1. it is unrealistic. 2. It is one sided 3. It is manipulative and sentimental 4. It is patriotic in the wrong way, till the point that makes one puke and sympathize with the Germans. 5. It demonizes and dehumanizes the Germans. 6. It is actually a very bad movie.As said, this is another rubbish film about the good Americans versus the evil Germans.The plot(if you may call it that) is so flawed and biased that i could not help it but sympathize strongly with the Germans and wish for the immediate and violent death of Private Ryan. Again, this resented person(Spielberg) is exorcising his inner demons, and portraying the Germans as cruel monsters without a soul. It was never that way.I sometimes wonder if people in USA go to school, read books or are capable of impartial and independent thought. Are they? I want to believe that there are still intelligent people in USA.The Rambo scene in which the Americans throw mortar grenades to the German tanks made me stop watching the movie. I finished it other day. I found it insulting and utterly repulsive. But of course:What can some poor evil German wretches do against private Ryan and his mariachis? Of course, nothing. Entire panzer divisions would perish against this stronghold of decency, morality, democracy, values, etc. Now, please hold on a second, because i need to puke.I am tired of the growing level of immorality and perversion displayed by Spielberg in his movies. It is all so one sided that makes you sick.I actually would like to watch a movie in which a few dumb German soldiers, behaving like idiots and chewing gum, destroy with stones an entire American armored division. This would be good fun, because this is exactly what Spielberg tries to convey in reverse. Really bad movie, bordering immorality in his depiction of the German side. We did not need this movie.",1,7,17,24 May 2010
Schindler's List," What's wrong with Spielberg?
","This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, and it made me very angry. This movie is so one sided and dishonest, so terribly sentimental(in the wrong way) and so flawed and biased that falls immediately into the category of deliberate immorality, obscenity and perversion.I think Spielberg should hire a good shrine, and solve his problems, instead of making available to the public movies only therapeutic for his mind.Indescribable rubbish, impossible to watch. Of course, the Jews are very good and the Germans are very bad, as usual. The level of one sided propaganda reaches pornographic dimensions.",1,17,51,24 May 2010
The Man Who Would Be King," The Mason who would be a God
","I always liked this movie. When I watched it as a child, I was so captivated by the movie that when Connery accepts fate in the bridge and starts singing, I could not help it and shouted: Sean, Run, Escape¡¡¡ I almost cried.It is indeed a very good movie, one of my favorites. They do not really make movies like this anymore. This movie has pure magic for several reasons:1. It is a movie about unconditional Friendship. 2. It is a movie about the realization of a very old dream: a man who wants to conquer a kingdom. Many tried, most failed. In fact, Peachy and Daniel could have been the perfect mercenaries in the armies of Hernán Cortés, Conqueror of México, or Francisco Pizarro, Conqueror of Peru. Connery and Caine are two thoroughly unscrupulous buddies whose only redeeming qualities are their capacity for dreaming and their loyalty to each other. 3. This movie is indeed high adventure.The only thing i do not like in this movie, and the reason why i give it a six, it is because the whole freemasonry thing is totally unnecessary, a total sham. So, Alexander the Great was a mason, and a couple of English blokes who are masons too end up being kings of the Masonic Kingdom of Kafiristán. That is just not believable, and destroys the story. As for the rest, the movie is just great: good script, superb actors in very fitting roles, good directions, good scenery, magic atmosphere, it is pure magic. Pity they blundered it with the stupid masonic twist, which is unnecessary, not realistic, and plain silly, as it borders the ridiculous. Nevertheless, it is a classic, it is good to watch, and it is indeed a very good movie.",6,0,4,29 June 2013
Lord of War," Good Movie
","This is a good movie. It is a very well told and described story, and contains and delivers a message. I did like it. I was just about to puke when the wife of Nicolas Cage abandoned him on moral grounds, but later, when Nicolas Cage is released and the movie departs for a while from its politically correct point of view, i was delighted.It is not brilliant, but it is actually quite good. Cage is great, as usual, the plot is well thought, the Liberian Dictator André Baptiste(Taylor was the real name of the dictator) is very well depicted, and it is amazing to see the effect of the fall of the Soviet Empire.Yes, it is a very pleasant movie.",7,1,3,1 June 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Was this Sherlock Holmes or Harry Potter?
","I do like Sherlock Holmes movies. I was quite thrilled, because a new movie about Sherlock is always a good thing. However, i must say i was quite disappointed with the result.Why was i disappointed?1. The plot is simple, the action is slow, and there is no intrigue or suspense whatsoever. You always know all the time who the bad guy is, and how things are going to develop. 2. The duo Law-Downey Jr. seems ineffective to me, and it is unable to transmit positive chemistry. 3. The Ninja abilities of Holmes and Watson are for children, or for brain-dead people. If you want to see this kind of action, it is better to watch a Bruce Lee, Jacky Chan or Chow Yoon Fat movie. 4. The Bad guy, Lord Blackwood, is very thin, does not transmit any fear whatsoever, and it is actually like a dummy. It looks like the bad guy of a Harry Potter movie for 7 year old children. It is in fact so bad that it makes no sense at all, and conveys very poor feelings. He is not a memorable villain, but a very weak villain in a ridiculous Harry Potter style. 5. The use of humor is also very childish and easy, for non intelligent people. 6. Secondary characters like Lord Coward are just pitiful clichés. 7. The use of satanism and black magic might be good for the plot. However, in this case looks more like a bunch of Harry Potter apprentices. The use of a book of spells(new age pseudo-witchcraft) is ridiculous. 8. To sum up, this is a very poorly designed movie, with a very bad plot, an uninteresting story, and grotesque characters. It is just a 'harry potter' sherlock Holmes for children and not very intelligent people. However, i suppose that you can enjoy the movie if you are between 7-12 years old.",1,8,15,3 June 2010
Centurion," A simple but effective Revenge, Chase and Hunt Story
","The argument is simple: Agricola, Roman Governor of Brittannia wants to look good with his superiors in Rome and get rid once and for all of the Picts, a savage northern tribe of warriors who do not accept roman rule. The 9th Legion, commandeered by Dominic West, tries to do the job by penetrating far into the Pict lines, but it is ambushed and pretty much wiped off the planet by the savage picts. The rest of the Story is just a chase motivated by revenge, in which a group of Pict warriors and scouts led by a quite frightful woman hunt the few remaining survivors of the 9th legion, who are determined to get back to safety and arrive to Roman controlled lands. Good points: 1. The story is honest, simple and well told. 2. The fighting scenes are very good quality. 3. The movie keeps always the interest and is very interesting, as you never know whether the Romans will make it back to camp or not. 4. The acting is decentBad Points: it lacks historical credibility, and the script has a couple of big mistakes, and a far from satisfactory ending, which is very quick and a bit of a nonsense.However, all in all, this movie is pretty good fun, good acting, a lot of tension and emotion, as people are always fighting on the run, and the scenery and atmosphere are very good. So, it is far from a masterpiece, but it is actually a pretty good movie to watch, highly entertaining. There are warrior women, good fights, lots of blood and violence in a somewhat 'primitive gory style', and even the occasional extremely beautiful woman. So, this is one we can all watch and do not feel disappointed. As said, it is not brilliant, but it is quite a good one actually.",7,2,5,29 January 2011
