The New World," What a waste of a good idea
","This movie had the makings of being great, beautiful locations, authentic sets, great actors, score, script, everything... So what happened. I don't know, there were so many things wrong that I lost count and wanted to leave after about 15 minutes knowing that it was hopeless. Was there a script to this movie? - I don't know because hardly anyone had any face to face dialog. The editing was dismal, I don't think a piece of film was left on the cutting floor. The whole movie felt chopped up with no story-line and character development. I like this genre, authentic historical pieces, so that's why I went, but take away the sets, costumes and scenery and you are left with an empty shell that moves slower than the over-long scenes of rivers flowing to eternity.James Horners music was so annoying, I wanted to cover my ears and the hand held camera was so bad in a couple of scenes I was dizzy and had to look away. At the end I couldn't help but feel that a lot of wonderful work went into this movie, the sets, the costumes, the ships, the locations and it was all a waste.",3,1,5,1 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," It's a movie, NOT the book
","As a huge fan of the books, we have to keep this in context. This is a movie, there is no way it could have included all of the book. I use the movies as fillers between the books, entertaining, but just fillers. That said, there were some glaring omissions that are vital to the next book. Why did Mike Newell extend the dragon scene, but leave out key characters? - because mistakenly Hollywood thinks that such exciting CGI is more important to the fans of the books than expanding characters and plot details. Wrong. But we will go and see the movie anyway.I felt the movie was chopped up. The Quiddich World Cup while fascinatingly done in the movie was over so quickly that it barely seemed to be a part of the plot. Mr Crouch is suddenly dead, but it is just left dangling. Why bother to have Sirius in the movie at all, his brief scene in the fire was really disappointing, his head should have been fully out of the embers, as in the book, not part of the embers. He was barely recognizable as Sirius. What a waste.No Ludo, no Winky and Dumbledore looking like a bumbling idiot rather than the world's most powerful wizard. Most importantly the whole end of the book is gone where he has a parting of the ways with Fudge and the Ministry of Magic, because of Fudge's refusal to believe that Voldermort is back. This whole scene sets up the next book.So where does this movie adaptation shine? In the script and the impeccable casting. Despite what some have said about Daniel Radcliffe, he IS Harry. From the first movie, his sweet innocence to how he has grown into the part, he remains the face I see when I read the books. Emma Watson needs to tone down her overacting a bit, she was near perfect in the first movie, but hasn't really developed her character much. Rupert Grint really shines in this movie, his face is handsome, and funny and full of expression, he is the perfect Ron. The Phelps boys, as Fred & George really come into their own in this movie although how they are to start their joke shop without Harry's Tri-wizard winnings in film #5, is a question since it was entirely missing from the movie. And it was nice to see Neville getting a bigger more important role, even though all of his key info was left out of the movie. And now I've read book six, Snape takes on a whole new meaning to me and again Alan Rickman has been the perfect Snape in all of the movies.The question as to whether the three main characters should remain on after the release of the 5th movie in summer 2007 seems a dumb question to me. Since when has Hollywood ever cared about the age of an actor and the part he or she is playing? How often have we had 20 somethings playing teenagers! There comes a time when the age of Daniel, Emma and Rupert will not matter to the audience. Personally I hope that they play in all of the movies.They say that JK Rowling has a big say in what stays in and what is left out of her books, because she alone knows what happens and how each piece of the jigsaw fits. She must have been on holiday when decisions were made for this movie. Perhaps 'the Director's Cut' DVD will explain that also...",8,12,14,25 November 2005
