Skyfall," The 'New' James Bond
","Sam Mendes's first shot as a Bond movie director was a huge success. Not only from the box office perspective (probably, since we do not have the definite numbers) but also in finishing the transition process between the (extremely and at times unnecessarily) cool, suave and somewhat dull Connery-style Bond, and the one we see in Skyfall.Daniel Craig has showed us a much darker and colder Bond, with a lot more personality than its predecessors. This may be source of debate, but from my point of view this was a very positive change which allowed Craig's Bond to be more in touch with the audience. Audience that's not seeing a good-looking actor inside an expensive tuxedo drinking shaken but not stirred Martinis anymore, it is now seeing a much more human and vulnerable Bond.Timothy Dalton started this transition. It is important to point out that he managed to give us a great movie (The Living Daylights), despite the usual, somewhat ridiculous scenes Bond had us used to at the time, such as the mountain chase on top of a cello or Joe Don Baker as the villain, Brad Whitaker (probably one of the dullest and less-evil villains in the 007 franchise ever).Then of course came Pierce Brosnan, who I think is the one who built the road Daniel Craig is walking on today. The path of less martinis and more action, without leaving elegance and fortitude behind.Coming back to Skyfall, it is a movie that traps you from the very first second. It is also a film that has an almost perfect mix of comedy, suspense, sadness and also a sensation that (cleverly attached to the movie title) makes you feel the sky is falling down. We get to see in this movie that the invincible James Bond, is not invincible anymore. We get to see a lonely Bond that has to complete his mission with little or no backup at all. There is no 'Plan B', there's only a Bond trapped on a dead end.All these features make of Skyfall a unique movie and a film that, without forgetting the old Bond we all like to see, gives us the first Bond that could be (please note I said 'could', I am not a fortune- teller) in the folder that contains the names of the Academy Awards Nominees.To end this review I have to say one more thing. This is a must-see. No fan of the 007 franchise that respects himself can let this movie disappear from the cinemas without watching it. 100% recommended.",8,0,8,10 November 2012
