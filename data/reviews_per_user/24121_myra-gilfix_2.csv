The King's Speech," The back story of a famous and historical speech.
","This film had been heaped with praise before I saw it. I dislike having high expectations of a movie, and I was sure it would not live up to the 'hype.' However, I came away from the viewing with my expectations happily exceeded. The story was human, historical and well-told. The acting by all, including Helena Bonham-Carter, was outstanding. Perhaps needless to say, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush both deserve Oscars. It was refreshing to be totally absorbed by a story and by the characters and their interactions instead of by violence, chase scenes and explosions. Despite the lack of 'action,' the movie kept my attention with the suspense that built naturally from the evolution of the speech. The relationships between the characters, the King and Queen, and the King and his therapist/friend were also well-developed. Since so much has been said about the two main characters, I want to add that Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal conveyed a queen who was loving, no-nonsense, traditional, but with a sense of humor. She also managed to balance the status issue with a healthy dose of down-to-earth-ness. I highly recommend this film.",9,1,3,20 February 2011
The Town," Anatomy of a bank robbery in the context of character relationships, Charlestown, and the inevitable love interest.
","This movie was hyped quite a bit before I saw it. And a lot of it was deserved. However, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the high action content, I found myself drowsy at times. Too much of the usual chaos of robberies gone awry in some way. I found myself confused about the relationships with the 'bad guys' who forced Affleck's character to do another job. Perhaps that was because I had trouble staying awake...which I don't necessarily blame on the movie. The acting was good, and I did admire Affleck's understatedness. Rebecca Hall did a good job as the bank manager. In fact, the trailer led me to believe (and hope) that more of the story would involve those two characters and the relationship twists inherent in their story. I think that was my biggest disappointment. Too much of the inevitable shoot-'em-up, the predictable FBI involvement. Too many innocents killed without any real character remorse -- which I would have hoped for given the depth of the characters portrayed. This movie obviously succeeded without my approval. I just didn't think it deserved all the praise it garnered.",5,0,1,20 February 2011
