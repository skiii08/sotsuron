Black Swan," Absolutely Brilliant
","Darren Aronofsky is by far one of my favorite directors. I saw 'Requiem for a Dream' about a month ago and I was thoroughly impressed. When I saw that he had directed Black Swan, I had to go see it. I saw this film in December when it first came out on limited release. I was once again blown away by Aronofsky's unique style that is unlike any other director's. The premise of the film is something that everyone can relate to, which is the pursuit of perfection. Aronofsky portrays it in such an dark, eccentric, brilliant fashion that the film becomes alive like no other. The acting was incredible, so you were able to get inside the minds of the characters. Everything in this film was flawless. I hope to see much more work from Aronofsky in the future. Reed Sligar",10,2,5,22 January 2011
