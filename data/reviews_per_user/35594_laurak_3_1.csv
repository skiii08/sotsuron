Requiem for a Dream," So Unbelievably Good...I Cried!
","I heard of this film but i kept putting it off. So I finally watched it the other day and i was gripping the edge of my seat...literally!! It's so horrible that you just want to stop watching but you really can't cos you want to carry on. The acting in this is so super...i actually wanna watch it again now!! I recommended this film to my mother and she watched it with my brother...the look on their faces was so shocking...they looked so scared but after the movie i asked them how it was...they said they loved it! I only watched it as i'm totally obsessed with Jared Leto but i must say his acting was excellent along with all the other actors...It was so good, i cried. and i haven't cried in a very very long time. I would recommend this film to anyone because it really does make you feel and it really makes you think about all the people with real problems and not just petty ones..like ' oh crap..I forgot my homework ' --x",9,2,4,5 February 2007
