The Blair Witch Project," Ridiculous horror
","This is just boring and a waste of time to watch. Nothing scary happens, it is just about three people in the woods screaming and walking everywhere. That's it. Terrible movie with nothing happening.",2,7,11,21 April 2018
Hereditary," Best horror movie of 2018
","Hereditary I would give a solid 9/10. Here are the reasons why I loved it and some parts I didn't like about it.Positive Thoughts: Hereditary is definitely not one of those horror movies that are meant for the mainstream audience to watch such as 'mother!' and are used to horror movies that mostly have jump scares like IT or Insidious. Instead, this doesnt have any jump scares and has the tendency to make you linger and get chills down your spine. Toni Collettes performance as Annie was phenomenal and will be unforgettable because of how much character she brought to life inside after Charlie, the daughter of the Graham family died and turns out to be more serious and insanely horrific. Alex Wolff was without a doubt great and Milly Shapiro gave me chills. The cinematography is brilliant because its unusual from other movies I have seen before. Also, the music score is beyond amazing and causes me to think and get spooked while listening to the spine-tingling music. The magnificent use of grief and fear becoming a malicious duo is brilliant.Negative Thoughts: Even though this is definitely horrifying. There are a few moments where I unintentionally laughed at that were supposed to be taken serious. Sometimes when Peter (Alex Wolff) was crying I tried too hard to not laugh a bit. About 15 mins in this movie where a bird flies into a window at Charlie's (Milly Shapiro) school, she cuts off its head and I thought that was a tad bit hilarious. That was the main issue that almost ruined the movie for me.Regardless of my dislikes about Hereditary, it is an amazing horror movie and I would recommend anyone who has never seen it to go and watch it.",9,2,8,11 August 2018
Us," Much better than Get Out!
","I have been waiting to see this movie since the trailer first came out. And Jordan Peele's sophomore film, Us, did not disappoint! Us was sickening, twisted, and downright horrifying! With excellent acting and a perfect story, Us is truly a must-see movie!",9,4,12,23 March 2019
American Hustle," Great ensemble, great acting, great movie
","This movie is not bad at all to watch. David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook is one of my favorite movies of all time and this was another amazing movie directed by O. Russell. The whole cast including Christian Bale, Amy Adams Jennifer Lawrence, and Bradley Cooper are one of Hollywoods best entertainers this generation. Their performances were perfect. The whole entire movie to me was very thought-provoking and was well directed, well edited, and well written. This is one of the best Crime movies of the 2010's so far.",7,1,2,27 March 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," WORTH THE HYPE!
","This is truly Quentin Tarantino's best film. It has the perfect ensemble for a movie set in the retro age of Los Angeles. It's outrageously funny, perfectly written storyline, and sets the right mood for the audience. Profoundly excellent!",10,42,66,30 July 2019
The Incredibles," My favorite Disney movie of all time

The Shape of Water," Oscar Worthy Indeed
",This movie was amazing. An unusual yet beautiful movie. What else can I say other than a well-written movie with a great cast and crew,8,30,56,31 March 2018
Parasite," Speechless
","I've been hearing great things about this and after it won 4 Oscars including Best Picture I just had to see for myself even though I wasn't 100% sure what it was about. After only 15 minutes of watching I fell in love with this movie. And it got every award it deserved. Parasite has so many genres in this movie but I would have to say this is darkly written in the most creative way possible. It's funny, dramatic, and intense. I can't even think of anything that I didn't like about this movie because I seriously enjoyed every minute of it. 10/10",10,11,16,11 February 2020
The Conjuring," My #1 favorite horror movie of all time

Carrie," My favorite Stephen King adaptation
","Very well done. Sissy Spacek gave an excellent performance and Brian De Palma directed this movie fantastically. This was scary, sad, and definitely a classic to the horror movie genre.",10,2,3,9 April 2018
Mother!," Definitely not made for everyone
","This movie is beyond outstanding on so many levels. Many people may dislike or hate this movie because it is not a typical horror film such as having jumpscares ir torture. Mother! has a different kind of taste in the horror genre. Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem play a peaceful couple until a man and his wife come along and interrupt their relationship and existence. The biblical references are magnificent, the cinematography is amazing, fantastic acting, and amazing film editing. I'm not familiar with Aronofsky's work, but this i found to be intriguing and horrifying. I would recommend this to anyone who loves film, because this movie will definitely be talked about for years.",10,1,3,13 April 2018
Incredibles 2," Incredibles 2 Is INCREDIBLE
",The Incredibles is my favorite Disney movie of all time and I could not wait until it's sequel would show in theaters. The storyline of Incredibles 2 is brilliant and is more action-packed along with humorous moments as well. Incrdibles 2 is definitely worth the 14 year wait and NOT a waste of your money! This is an incredible sequel (pun intended)!,9,4,9,18 June 2018
The Wizard of Oz," The Best Musical Of All Time
","This is truly a beautiful cinematic masterpiece. Colorful characters, amazing cinematography, beautiful songs, and most certainly Judy Garland's iconic role she has ever played.",10,1,1,23 April 2018
