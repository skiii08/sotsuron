The Devil's Advocate," Morality and temptation
","I wasn't really sure what to expect from The Devil's Advocate, drama?, horror?, comedy?, thriller?, in the event it ended up as all of those things. but did it work?.The plot was interesting but not by any means unique, young lawyer encouraged to join big legal outfit for even bigger Bucks. As expected the firm had much to hide as the lawyer, Keanu Reeves begins to discover.Many twists and turns later I found that my concentration was no longer being held. Further more with very little sympathy for any of the characters I didn't care too much what happened to any of them.The final twenty minutes or so created a degree of suspense and sensuality but then that could have been brought to a head much sooner. As it transpired this was a film about morality and temptation, and as such it was partially succcessful. It has been done much better elsewhere however so for me it didn't really work.Al Pacino came across as quite a plausible old Devil and managed to keep something of a grip despite otherwise mediocre performances from the support.",Null,0,0,15 November 1998
