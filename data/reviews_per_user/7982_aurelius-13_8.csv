Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's still one of my favorite
","Okay... let's get something straight. I first saw this movie when i was about nine-years-old and this was my first Star Wars and probably my first space movie I had ever watched. This movie wanted me to study astronomy; let my interest towards space to expand but that's irrelevant. I still hold this episode my third favorite under Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith. SPOILER: Skip the positives and negatives please if don't want to be spoiled!Positive: 1. We begin with two Jedi: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jinn. Qui Gon is my favorite of his character and his look. I think we all know who Obi-Wan is. They fight their way through the Droid ambush and try to infiltrate the command center to arrest the viceroy. So mainly we have a great introduction!2. Jar Jar Binks. Now I know there has been many critics about this alien but during my childhood, most of the children and i adored him when this movie first came out. He's funny and I still like his character. He was the alien that at least tried to bring some comedy into the movie. 3. Anakin Skywalker. The boy that was close to my age that was the prominent character and hero of the episode. Cut this kid some slack! He changed from a slave into a pod-racing winner and a war hero for destroying the main ship that deactivated the droids in Naboo. 4. Naboo! Ah man... I still remember the underwater city and the adventure of seeing new aquatic creatures: the gigantic piranha-like fish, the Godzilla-like fish, etc. 5. Darth Sidious, alias as Senator Palpatine. His anonymous identity made us wonder who he was. He didn't do anything major in this but still he was so cool. 6. And yes who could forget Darth Maul, the only Sith warrior who used a double-bladed lightsaber and gave us a hell of an entertaining-lightsaber battle. He murdered Qui Gon and then the Obi Wan vs. Darth Maul duel was very phenomenal. Negative: Okay there was some negatives1. I mainly ignored the political debate in the assembly but if viewers first watch Star Wars in this order, people will be confused of what the bureaucrats are squabbling about. 2. Jar Jar Binks. I'm not putting this because I think he's negative, I am just warning the viewers that Jar Jar does several silly things and he's illiterate. So if you get used to the comedy or simply ignore him, you'll have a great time with this movie. 3. Darth Maul didn't have a long script. He only had about three sentences to say. And I wished he didn't die at all! The way he died didn't bother me, until I saw AOTC and thought he would resurrect or survive but... 4. If I watch it again, most of the characters are bland and dull. But it's understandable if you think about it: Jedi are pacifist and have broad discipline and can't feel no emotion, politicians generally are dead inside so they don't have a character of their own, and the queen's people and her planet are seized by the Trade Federation which is why she never had alternate feelings. Maybe the problem were too many serious people. Okay you got it! For the majority, many people hated and berated this movie because of Jar Jar Binks and it wasn't as the old trilogy. But what people should understand is that the prequels are for the new generation and the people that grew up with the prequels, like me... will adore the prequels more than the originals. So most of you Star Wars fans out there that love the originals, take an open mind and be comprehensive to the new Star Wars sagas. And for the rest of you that never saw Star Wars, star with number 4; it'll be more exciting that way.",7,2,3,9 May 2007
Madagascar," I can't believe it!
","First, let me explain that my parents inspired me to watch this movie which was a huge mistake. Okay, I was expecting a fantastic film created by Pixar but guess what, it was completely the opposite: the features were too cartoon-ish, the dialogue was horrible, the cast were trying too hard to come up with funny jokes, and some perverted stuff that shouldn't be shown or said through a child's movie.There hasn't been that many movies that made it to the top since year 2005: Star Wars 3. I think the only movies out there that put some real talent is Harry Potter.Anyway, Madagascar or 'Mad' for short is an insignificant family movie. Don't watch it if you don't want your brain to smash. Yeah there were some few laughs but not enough to enjoy.",3,0,4,27 October 2007
Terminator Salvation," Boring as hell!
","I literally almost fell asleep in this movie! Terminator 4 was horrible! The whole film was dramatic drivel that fooled everyone to be a high-action pack movie. The whole film had 95 percent drama and 5 percent action. I have to say that Terminator 3 was way better and more intense than this one! Spoiler: Positive: Almost nothing except the audio sound was amazing, especially when things ignite you can feel the rumbling from your chair. That's it! Oh, and you get to see Arnold Schwarznegger or however you spell his name for five minutes IN A COMPUTER-GENERATED FORM! Negative: Oh my gosh, the excessive drama, and the slow-moving from one scene to another! All of us did not come to watch Terminator 4 to know the long explanation about mankind's destruction by the Skynet machines. We already known that from the previous films. The entire film was definitely confusing. Things just pop up out of nowhere, and the film to me felt like being an inescapable maze. The list goes on! It was just dull and unexciting! In the last 30 minutes of film was the point where this film began its series of action and battles! When the human-like machine figured his real fate, the people that created him explains that his purpose was destroying the Resistance and John Connor. This is when Arnold comes in as the Terminator, but instead of ending the film there, the human machine defeats Arnold and risks his life to save John Connor. The film should have ended with Arnold, which will portray that the Terminator kills John Connor, which fulfills the legacy of the Terminator sequels in the previous films. This film fooled me, but let this fool you!",2,1,4,19 June 2009
Spider-Man 3," Way too much drama in the beginning!
","Now I am the type of person that brings both positives and negatives about movies but Spiderman 3 didn't do much for me. I mean in the beginning, luckily I've forgot most of the stuff, had way too much drama. Too sappy!SPOILER: Don't read the positives or negatives. Proceed to the last paragraph. Positives: Some good acting by Rosemary Harris (Spiderman's aunt) and J.K. Simmons (J Jonah Jameson), and Bruce Campbell (Maitre'd). That's all I know! The story gave us some laughs; like when Peter Parker in his dark side attitude starts dancing down the sidewalk while all these 'attractive' females looks at him either shocked or astounded. Some of the fight scenes are excellent as well. Sandman steeling money for the love of his daughter, Peter and MJ cries at the depressing death of Harry at the end, and oh yes who could forget about Mr. Jameson, the wisecrack-short-tempered employer and editor. The self-conflict of Peter Parker made the story more interesting and believable: 1. He let his anger consume him while fighting against Harry. 2. Fighting the guards in the club, Peter at the end slaps MJ at the ground. 3. Stealing the photographer's girlfriend. Negatives: Although the fight scenes were cool, the special effects seems like you're in a video game. What most directors that adores special effects should think is that it only works for movie theaters, not the story behind and DVD or VHS players. Next is the Venom's role. Why even bring the Venom in the story if you're only going to show him in the last fifteen minutes and gets destroyed by sound vibration? The crying scene when Harry died kind of made me chuckle a bit because of how Peter cried. I SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT SPIDERMAN IS IMMORTAL OR INVINCIBLE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN KILLED MORE THAN ONCE IN THIS MOVIE. The guy got clunked at the head more than George in the Jungle! By pipes, bricks, trains, streets, etc. It's get annoying after awhile.Well there you have it! Too much drama in the introduction. I would have written more complaints and support but I kind of forgotten rest of the movie except the fighting scenes. The director, Saimi, did a splendid job in Spiderman 1 and 2 but I think he had the Soap-operas in him. This movie was more depressing than its predecessors. It tried to become like the LOTR's trilogy but what Saimi forgotten was that you can't change the sequels' characteristics and atmosphere. Star Wars can't be overly-dramatic like in AOTC for example. You can take my word for it but everyone has their own set of ideas. Like I said before, I look at both sides of a movie, not just one set. I would give it a three but it was just too gloomy.",2,0,3,5 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A stupendous final for the trilogy.
","Many has complained has complained about the Ewoks in this movie but for me, it was tolerable. At least it did have a great message modifying that technology doesn't always win wars again primitive or savages. SPOILER: In the beginning of this movie, Luke Skywalker arrives in Tatooine and defeat Jabba Hutt and rescue Han Solo. After that, we meet the Ewoks and yes we see them doing their cute battle thing. My favorite character, who no one never talks about during an interview or premiere, is the emperor. We see him as his deformed appearance and yes he's cranky, twisted, and sinister as ever. I just like supreme villains. My favorite scene was the conclusion when Darth Vader throws the emperor into the electrical shaft, which was beautiful. The light-sabers are primitive, not like the ones in the prequels so don't take it personal.",8,0,1,22 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great Ending
","I love Star Wars. I like the video games, the adventure, and yes the light saber duels. It just had a little too dramatic between Anakin and Padme. I wished that the light saber duel was more than intense, but this is what we got. The mêlée between Count Dooku and Anakin had a rudimentary level footage. It wasn't really a battle. The ending was especially good though. The Jedi defending themselves against the mass-armed droids and other aliens. We finally see the Clones and how they are generated. The final climax and duel between Yoda and Count Dooku was magnificent however short. Alas, we still don't know the identity of Darth Sidious; moreover you see him on at the end. This is why it's a good movie!",7,2,2,16 June 2007
Event Horizon," A decent horror film
","Event Horizon is one of my favorite horror films to watch. When I was a child I have seen one scene where this man's skin is scorched, but this demonic being is also immortal. The conclusion really grabbed my attention to watch the whole movie. Spoiler: So we begin a missing spacecraft, which was zapped faster than light-speed and it cut through another dimension that was unfortunately 'Hell.' When the ship was discovered seven years after, this crew flies to this missing-mysterious spaceship and venture around. Throughout their quest in the vessel, each individual of the crew kept having these hallucinations about their despondent past. Later on, a scientist named Dr. Weir who has constructed this hellish spacecraft have finally told the crew the secret that this ship was brought back from Hell. This is where the good part starts. After when most of the crew died, the captain and two other survivors tries to destroy one part of the ship so the other part can freely return to Earth. The cool thing is after the captain solely places the last detonator on the ship, a strong heat was closely beside him and this fiery being who is actually Dr. Weir appears; this is what I have explained above. Spoilers:Positives: The grasping-terrifying ship, great frightening decorations like the spikes at every door, the music, the flashbacks, the gore wasn't overdone, and the actors played very well.Negatives: When the crew discovered a camera that recorded what happened during the mysterious disappearance, the video showed the earlier crew being tortured but it seemed too short: although the deleted scenes show 30 minutes of this, which I haven't seen. They could have shown more on the captain's past, and they could show what the youngest member saw when he was forced inside this dark dimension. Please, give it a chance. The movie is very great despite that this didn't have great results. In my opinion, you will enjoy every moment of it.",8,1,5,27 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Multiple Action!
","Spectacular imagery of action. This episode has more light saber battles, more clones vs. droids battle, and finally an episode where evil wins.1. Darth Sidious is finally solved (Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine). This man is the puppeteer of Anakin Skywalker. This mastermind was masquerading his true identity, whom he played very well. He changed a democracy into a dictatorship, gain power to excessive power, and manipulated a heap of delegates to offer him power.2. In the beginning Anakin defeats a sith warrior and now he becomes a sith warrior. Ironic! The main reason I watched this movie is to see the duel between Yoda and the emperor but it was kind of short since the crew mixed both major duels (Obi Wan vs. Anakin and Yoda vs. Emperor) together.People say this movie has special effects or CGI but this didn't bother me much. Anyway great movie. Like I said before a lot of action and great battles but I warn you, THE ROMANTIC SCENES BETWEEN ANAKIN AND PADME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELETED! There was one scene where Anakin and Padme shares their feelings with each other and they keep on repeating 'I love you!' 'No I love you' 'No I love you' 'You're beautiful' 'No you're beautiful' You get it.",8,0,1,16 June 2007
