The Blair Witch Project," Not as good as all the hype.
","Disappointing for me.  It was not as scary as all of the hype would lead one to believe.  Inventive, and well acted, but not scary, at least for me. Once we see the actors in other movies, it will be even less believable.",2,0,1,4 August 1999
