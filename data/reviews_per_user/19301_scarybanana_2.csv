The Blair Witch Project," scary...I don't think so!!!
","Billed as one of the scariest true stories of all time...whose kidding who? Pathetic more like.  We all know that it's not a true story and for anyone who believes it is, I have one word for you....gullible!!! To make matters worse, they then made sequels... come on, we are intelligent life forms.",Null,0,1,5 May 2003
Lilo & Stitch," One of the best ever Disney Films
","As a 26 year old female, it might surprise some people to learn that I am a life long disney film fanatic.  There really hasn't been a bad movie(well, Pocohontas is the exception)  This film did not disappoint, in fact, it touched home because through animation it portrayed how a young girls life can be affected by being part of a broken family.  I work with teenagers who are mostly from 'broken' homes and a truer picture has yet to be painted...until now.  A Disney Classic, without a doubt.",Null,0,0,14 May 2003
