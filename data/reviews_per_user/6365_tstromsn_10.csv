Iron Man 3," Nothing made sense
","Saw this with a friend and we both agreed: All the dialogs between the characters felt cartoony and unrealistic. The main character is acting like an asshole with no feelings, and you have no sympathy for him. I actually wished him dead. He also fights better without his iron man suit, so one wonder why he would even need this suit. The best characters in the movie are the business man villain and the guy who acts the president. These actors give a convincing performance. Too bad they have very little screen-time. The story evolves more about Stark's personal life problems and past than much action with his iron man suit. At one point I was wondering if I was watching iron man. What's left is some mediocre CGI effects and action scenes that makes no sense; One example is a remote guided iron man robot who grabs a villain and flies high up in the air with him. Then the villain ripps of his head and both plumbs to the ground and die. If you were caught by a flying man, would you commit suicide? Add a lot of clich√© and predictable dialoge and ending and you end up with a boring ending and a boring movie. This movie was yawnilly boring.",1,2,5,8 July 2015
World War Z," No character build-up, no focus and a really bad ending
","I am that kind of guy who either love a movie or hate a movie. So my ratings usually are 1 / 10 or 9 / 10 or the rare occasion: 10 / 10 (the perfect movie) This movie I didn't like. The main problem is that it has no character build-up. After 5 minutes after we meet the characters the action starts. By now I don't even know the name of any of them, and I couldn't care if any of them died. Sadly we are in the beginning introduced to a very interesting character, but sadly he is killed off as the moment we start to like him. Many scenes drag on for way too long, and I found the movie more comical than scary. Me and many others in the cinema laughed of how silly and stupid the 'zombies' acted. Also many of the scenes drag on way too long and you start to wonder what the director was thinking. The ending is one of the worst ending of any movie I have ever seen. It felt like the whole thing was pointless and it left zero impact. A good movie is a movie you can see endless times. This movie I will only see once.",1,10,18,12 July 2013
Armageddon," Pompus, tiresome and hero worshipping
","When the movie was finish I was really tired. Why?
Constant camera panning, explosions, flashing lights, zooming, slow motion
and that the movie is just too long.
The actors also talk too much. When they are in the middle of danger they look in to the camera and say these cheesy one liners.
I will never see this movie again. I hope.",3,2,7,24 February 2020
Dunkirk," Realistic, but boring
","In this movie, you are a fly on the wall watching scenarios from various soldiers and civilians during the battle of Dunkirk. You don't get to know the characters therefore care very little of what will happened to them. It's portrayed quite realistically. The flight sequences are the best one, but they are not long sadly and quite far in between. Everything looks authentic. Could not tell where it was used CGI. Recommended to war buffs and history freaks. If you want an exciting and good story, look elsewhere.",6,4,5,28 August 2017
Foxcatcher," Utterly boring
","This movie is not only boring, it also looks boring: Gray palette that gives it this flat and dull look. The pace is also very slow and it feels like the actors are bored and just want to get the movie over with. The music also wants to put you to sleep it seems. Or the lack of it.The movie is also based on a true story, yet the actors who portrays the real characters, are doing a very poor job. As an example; The actor who plays Dave, resembles nothing how he was in real life: Funny, full of energy, witty, always cheerful. The only similarity they have, is that he has a beard and is balding. The Same goes for the actor who plays John Du Pont; John Du Pont were never this slow or psycho as he is portrayed in the movie. And no way he had THAT big nose!If you want to see something interesting and exciting, watch the documentary! This movie is just boring and a waste of time. And you learn nothing from it.",3,1,3,8 October 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," So boring I had to leave the cinema
","I've seen the other 'Once upon a time' films. The 'West' was good. The 'America' I found too long and boring. Every scene dragged out way to the point of annoyance.Same with this 'Hollywood' version now directed by Quentin Tarantino;
It seems the entire movie is a documentary of details and recreation of how it looked back in those days. That is fine, but don't forget you are filming a movie. Not adapting a book that has to describe how everything looks, how a person walks, and how the methodically smoke their cigarette.
That is boring to watch and is not driving the story.So after 1 1/2 hour and the movie still doesn't make me care for the characters or what the point of the movie is, making me sit in my chair yawning and still wondering what the plot is, me and my date also agree to go as I saw she was bored as hell.
Several other people in the cinema had left before us too.So I am wondering what all the praise for this bore fest is?
I might watch it again later on other means just to see the ending.
A day I am bored and have nothing else to do.",1,12,17,16 September 2019
A Quiet Place," The Last Of Us - The movie
","This movie copies the PS3 / 4 game The Last Of Us in every way.
I find it funny so many people reviewing this title not seeing this.
Similiarities = girl dies in the beginning
<ul><li>fast forward in time = new annoying girl and older woman</li><li>the monster looks and behaves excactly like the clickers in the game</li></ul>I can go on and on... it's almost like a rippoff of the game. The movie is very quiet, and not very scary and you be better off playing the game.
Though I would not recommend the game either as it is way to linear and scripted.",1,2,7,15 April 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Not believable
","This third part of the trilogy just felt lazy, poorly slapped together and not believable.The Michael Corleone we got to know in part 1 and 2 is not the same in part 3. Here you just get Al Pacino's lazy acting (just being himself) just shouting and raising his voice where it's not appropriate.
It just feels he went into this movie without any heart and soul and care for the character just to make a quick buck.The rest of the cast too doesn't belong either. The girl who plays his daughter simply can't act (I know she got the part just because she is the daughter of the director. What a shame).We also get some pretty silly action scenes that just looks stupid: Drive by on a horse? Come on.
Also the way they lured a gangster into the trap by calling him names just felt unbelievable: Nobody would have fell for that.The movie is too long, too boring and have some pretty cringy moments here and there.
Compared to Godfather part 1, this one stinks.",4,2,5,29 July 2019
Joker," Good movie, but doesn't belong in the Batman universe
","I felt they used the title 'Joker' just to get more people to the cinema. It's like a click bait thumbnail on Youtube, only that once you clicked it, you will still watch the entire thing because it's very interesting and good.The whole thing feels like a realistic, almost documentary style of dwelling in the mind of a madman and how he reaches breaking point.All this is happening in Gotham city, but it feels just like any normal city. So when they put some of the Batman story lines in there it just felt out of place and sort of ruined the realism of it all.
It would have been better if they left it out.But don't get me wrong. It's a great movie. Go watch it. Joaquin Phoenix is amazing. He better get an Oscar for this.",7,1,3,19 January 2020
Alien: Covenant," When the only interesting character is an android, you know they f***** up
","Using the original theme from Alien felt misplaced. The theme has this 70 vibe over it and when you heard it you just remembered the original movie and it did not fit with what you saw on the screen.I had to laugh a bit when they had landed on the planet and walked among a corn field. They were like looking suspicious and said 'who planted this... and why?' It was funny cause here we are in 2017 looking at an Alien movie where they walk in a corn field asking silly questions and looking all suspicious, while in the first Alien they were inside the derelict craft looking scared. Thanks Ridley! You really upped your game here!The rest of the movie is a mess. CGI aliens jumping all over looking fake and face luggers bouncing around choking people. I never once felt scared during this movie. It is just so boring and predictable.Never felt for the characters either. In every scene the actors tried too hard, also making funny faces and saying things that felt out of place. The two android characters were the only one interesting. The fight scene among them were cool too.The twist at the end I saw coming a mile away.",4,1,4,2 September 2017
