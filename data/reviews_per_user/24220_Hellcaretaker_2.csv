The Blair Witch Project," Its one of them you love it or hate it
","Well I finally got to see the Witch on Sky never saw it at the Flicks nor did I buy the DVD.  Well what a new twist to telling a horror tell, it didnt need loads of flake gore or classic horror tricks like opening doors when you know the killer is hiding by the door etc etc.  If it been me in the wood I would have been as scared and more likely c**ped myself as well. Things really picked up at the end with the use of the voice coming though the trees.Tip... good idea to listen carefully to the people that they interview at the start of the film.",Null,0,1,13 October 2001
The Matrix," A suprise hit!!!
","Well what can I say thats not been said before,  this film was much better then Star Wars PM hands down.  At first the plot got me lost but come midway though it all fits into place like a big jigsaw.  Its about time we had a classic SC-FI like Matrix, Matrix was like a sleeping gaint it caught everyone by suprise.  I would recommend this everytime over Star Wars PM.",10,0,0,30 November 1999
