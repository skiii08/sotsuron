Marie Antoinette," i kinda loved it!
","i just got from the movie and i got to say that 'Marie Antoinette' is somewhat.. unexpected!! it's like champagne with grenadine syrup... just UNEXPECTED.. but good!! i am french and i have heard about Marie Antoinette for as far as i can remember! we all know here that she did some scandalous things and she wasn't as nice as she is depicted in the movie, for example, when she bowed on the balcony at the end without a single word, she actually said 'i don't want to say anything to those people' and she just bowed.. i think it's quite important to show that she wasn't concerned at all about normal people, she despised them. another bad point, is that the movie stops when she leaves Versailles to go to Metz, I wanted to watch the story till the end.. when she is stopped in a tavern, the king recognized thanks to his head printed on a coin, sent back to Paris in the Bastille ( the jail ), how the queen got depressed while staying there ( it is said that she got old at once, her hair turned white )and her death. To me, this movie lacks profoundness, too shallow... but the way it was filmed, the idea to mix pop rock music and the acting of the actors was definitely soooo great! WE WANTED MORE, IT WAS TOO SHORT!!",9,11,29,26 May 2006
