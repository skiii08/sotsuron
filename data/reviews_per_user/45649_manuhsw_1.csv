Hereditary," By far, my favourite horror film ever
","I have seen 'Hereditary' twice this week and I can say now that, it is for me, the best horror film of all time. I know this can sound exaggerated, but, with all due respect to the classics, I feel like Hereditary is the perfect balance between the masterfully crafted tension on classic horror films and the fast pace of today's cinema.For that, I would absolutely recommend this film",10,5,9,28 October 2018
