Angels & Demons," Angels? Demons?
","It may just be me, but from the trailer I was given the impression that this film would have Angels and Demons battling it out in brilliant CGI, but there was no such thing. As a matter of fact there wasn't a single angel or demon the entire way through. How ridiculous is that? It could quite possibly be the most misleading title and trailer combo I have ever seen! What this film is, as it turns out, is a lazy, unimaginative, bland and boring waste of time. From beginning to end it feels like the film makers didn't even try and the story was beyond bad. There were no interesting characters, no great acting performances, no stunning visuals, and not even a decent soundtrack. It's a poorly put tougher and very boring film that would be lucky to engage even the most easily amused viewers.",1,12,42,16 May 2009
Star Trek," Just another big budget disappointment
","I would like to start by saying that I am not a Star Trek fan, I am a film fan and as a film this sucked. Yes the special effects were brilliant but it was horribly acted, predictable, boring, and the story was just ridiculous. I mean this is a huge film, with a huge budget you would think they would create a story to match, something grand and epicÂ… But they didn't. Instead they went with a bland and uninteresting story that failed at every opportunity to drag me in or even keep my attention for more than two minutes.This wasn't enough though, having bored me half to sleep they decided it would be good to irritate me with endless barrage of stupid dialogue read seemingly by a bunch of zombies. I'm afraid I had reached my limit and walked out about twenty minutes before the end feeling both ripped off and disappointed.Waste of money.",1,56,169,9 May 2009
