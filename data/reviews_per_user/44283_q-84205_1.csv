Your Name.," This is a wonderful movie!
","This review may contain spoilers!The film is not the same as the Disney animated genre，because it is a love animation，maybe, it is not a suitable all the age animation,but it is undoubtedly a good animation，if we look at 'La La Land' - 'Titanic' - that is, look at the point of view of love movies, this is certainly one can make the Oscar nomination and even win an Oscar award's movie.Because not all animations are Disney type, not all animations are 3d.The whole movie is 'Misubi' as the story line，mainly about Tokyo high school student Taki and rural high school student Mitsuha the body is exchanged's story. In China, the film attracted countless people to see, and even some people read 5 times, 10 times, 20 times 30 times or even 60 times!This is how powerful the attraction ah！So, people who have not seen this movie, recommend you to see, even if you do not like the story, but beautiful pictures and excellent music will make you want to see a few times!",10,2,4,12 February 2017
