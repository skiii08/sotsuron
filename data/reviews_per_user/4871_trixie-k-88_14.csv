The Hangover," One of the funniest movies ever made
","The Hangover is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's clever, crazy and never leaves the viewer bored.Doug (Justin Bartha) is getting married, and his friends want to take him to Vegas for a bachelor party. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is a brash teacher desperate for fun, Stu (Ed Helms) is a dentist with a horribly controlling girlfriend, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) isDoug's bizarre brother-in-law to be. The night looks like it will be awesome, but things get crazy when Stu, Phil and Alan wake up the next morning to a trashed hotel room complete with a chicken, tiger and baby! Not only that, but Stu is missing a tooth and Doug is nowhere to be found. So the three guys set off to find out where their friend is, who the baby belongs to, and how the tiger ended up in their bathroom. The guys then go on a crazy two-day adventure figuring out what exactly they did that fateful night, and how to fix everything in time for Doug's wedding.This film is just hilarious, there's no other word to describe it. The guys get into crazy situations with weird twists and turns that are just confusing to the viewer as the characters. Along with the great characters and plot, The Hangover is chock full of great one liners and memorable quotes. If you're in the mood for a hilarious adult comedy, The Hangover is a real good time.",10,2,4,23 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The best of the series to begin our farewell
","We're nearing the end of the long-running Harry Potter epic. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has been split into two films. Is it going to be a great success or just a ploy for the film makers to squeeze an extra billion out of us? Dumbledore is dead, Voldemort is quickly working to take control of the Ministry, and Harry will become a legal adult on July 31st. Time is running out, and it's very clear that the three kids we have grown to love over a decade are not kids anymore. Harry, Ron and Hermione have chosen not to finish their last year in Hogwarts, and are preparing to go on a mission to find and destroy Voldemort before he takes over the world. Shortly before he turns 17, the remaining members of the Order help assist Harry back to the Weasley home in an intense battle with Death Eaters (and Voldemort) in the sky. Harry is feeling guilty over some deaths and injuries during the battle, but everyone else at the Burrow is preparing for the wedding of Bill, the eldest Weasley son to Fleur Delacour. But Bill and Fleur's wedding is interrupted by a frightening message that the Ministry has been taken over by Voldemort and the Death Eaters, so Harry, Ron and Hermione flee as quickly as possible. We follow them as they go around the Wizarding and Muggle world in search of horcruxes and attempting to destroy them. Through the clues that Dumbledore left and the help of Luna's father Xenophilius (Rhys Ifans), they discover that Voldemort is in search of the 'Deathly Hallows', three objects that will make him invincible. Emotions run high as both personal frustrations and ill will of Voldemort's seeps into the three best friends and tries to destroy them. Will they manage to destroy the horcruxes and find the Deathly Hallows before Voldemort becomes more powerful than ever? This is probably the best Harry Potter film they ever made, I absolutely love it. The acting is great, the emotions depicted are intense, special effects are good, the fight scenes are exciting and any fan will be completely glued to the screen. One thing that I feel sets this film apart from the others is the pacing. Even the better paced Harry Potter films feel a bit rushed, as I imagine it's hard to fit a 4-700 page book into less than three hours of film. But this book was given an entire 4.5 hours to allow as much as possible, and thank goodness for that! There isn't as much happening in this film and some people find that boring, but I find it proof that they put a lot of effort into the film instead of just using it as a money maker. The characters in Harry Potter are deep, meaningful, and realistic in their own way. The film makers know their fans have grown to love and care for these people, and allowing us to watch their inner turmoil in some silence allows us to truly process and feel everything they have experienced—and that we have shared with them. It would have been better for them to include some other information the sixth film left out, but on the other hand that might have muddled up the plot and quieter tone of this film. The only criticisms I have of this is that they left out Tonks' announcement that she and Remus were having a child. This just irks me because it could have been done with just a few more seconds in the scene where the Order comes to the Dursley house. Other than that nitpick this film follows the first half of the book wonderfully, and flows very well on screen. Its only downfalls are the information the sixth film left out (particularly where the mirror shard came from and why Harry has it). This truly is the best Harry Potter film of the series, and a good way to start us off in saying goodbye to our favorite witches and wizards.",10,0,1,14 April 2012
Divergent," Why people don't respect the 'young adult' genre
","Since we apparently needed to continue the theme of young adult dystopian adventure, they adapted the first book in the Divergent series to film. So, how does it measure up? Divergent takes place in a bleak, strictly regimented future where everyone is born into certain 'factions' based primarily on their personality traits. Those may include intelligence, selflessness, fearlessness, justness and kindness. At a coming of age ceremony the young members of this society are given a test that dictates what faction they belong in—however, they able to choose the one they want no matter their results. Our teen protagonist Tris (Shailene Woodley) was born into the selfless faction, and is shocked to learn that the results of her personality test are inconclusive—therefore she is 'divergent', and cannot fit into society. However she chooses to join the fearless faction and with the help of some friends begins a covert overthrow of the government so this faction business can be done away with.Before I get into anything I'll say I've not read the books, so I do not know how this compares to the source material, nor if they did anything 'wrong' in the film. This movie felt forced. It felt like it just really, really wanted to be The Hunger Games. But unfortunately none of the characters, plot, or fictitious government were very good. I spent the entire movie thinking that the concept of their factions was so flimsy it was ridiculous. Mainly because the personality traits—kind, just, intelligent, selfless, and brave are NOT at all contradictory. I find it flat out impossible to believe that any person could possibly fit into just one faction. Not only that, but what the hell is the point of the test if you can choose your faction regardless of what the test says? It would at least make more sense if people must stay in the faction they're born into like a caste system, or just that one MUST go into the faction their test dictates. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable, and the acting really fell flat. I was very aware I was watching a movie, and was never engaged or excited by anything that happened.All in all this movie was a poorly acted and poorly executed mess that left me checking the time every few minutes. It's based on a storyline and characters that make no logical sense, and who try to be poignant but just come off sounding juvenile and foolish. Definitely not worth the time it takes to watch it.",3,1,2,7 November 2014
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Fantastic Installment of Harry Potter
","It's the third Harry Potter film and things are changing. Alfonso Cuarón has taken over directing, and as the characters get more mature, so too do the themes.It's summertime at the Dursleys again, and things only get harder for Harry when Uncle Vernon's dreadful sister Marge comes to visit. Harry is unable to control his emotions when she insults his parents, flies into a rage, and accidentally causes her to blow up like a balloon and float away. Still furious, Harry storms out and catches a ride on the night bus to the Leaky Cauldron. While on the bus he hears the latest wizarding news—mass murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison. Harry is even more alarmed when Ron's father tells him that Sirius Black was one of Voldemort's followers, and that he likely escaped to find and kill Harry. The whole if the wizarding world is on the lookout with dementors, the guards of Azkaban looking for Sirius and guarding Hogwarts. The dementors are dark, hooded creatures who drain all happiness from their victims. Harry learns first-hand how horrible they can be when one attacks him on the train to school; but luckily he is rescued by the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis). Professor Lupin proves to be the best teacher they have had in this subject, and even gives Harry private lessons to defend himself against dementors. Harry, Ron and Hermione try to go to their lessons, Quidditch, and on outings to Hogsmeade village as normally as possible with the constant search for Black going on. They manage well enough until it's rumored that Sirius Black has infiltrated Hogwarts, and the heroic trio go on their own personal mission to find him and discover what he really wants.This film is where the Harry Potter movies start to feel less like children's movies, and more like young adult movies. The tone and emotions are darker, the theme is more serious, and even the colors/lighting are darker. Cuarón did a good job on this film. Hogsmeade looks great, and the special effects with the hypogriff and patronus are really good. The only thing I don't really like about this movie is the wardrobe. In the first two films the students were almost always seen in wizard robes, but in this the students are always in normal 'muggle' clothing during their free time. I feel that seeing a witch and wizard in a sweater, jeans and sneakers takes a bit of the magic away. Some of the more 'traditional' wizard wardrobe has also changed, and looks more adult than in Columbus' designs. However, that probably is one of the only criticisms I have for this film. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have definitely learned to act better, and they have become Ron and Hermione, as Radcliffe has become Harry. Puberty is definitely setting in as the emotions for the characters (Harry especially) get more uncontrollable, and they seek more independence as well. Unlike the first or second film, we really get to see how emotionally damaged and traumatized Harry has been by witnessing his parents' death, and suffering a life of abuse and neglect. Some sexual/romantic tensions are also being strongly established between Ron and Hermione. Not to mention, this is the first film with Michael Gambon playing Dumbledore. Richard Harris was a hard act to follow, but Gambon has done a decent job. However, he is a very different Dumbledore—harsher, more serious, less whimsical. But the tone of this film being darker made the change (in both personality and actor) flow well. Gary Oldman and David Thewlis give good performances as well, with their characters filling in a good deal of information on the personal life of Harry's parents. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a great film with one thing for certain, our boy Harry is growing up!",9,0,1,3 April 2012
Twilight," An awful movie badly adapted from a poorly written book
","It would take weeks to sum up how bad not only this film is, but all the Twilight movies and Twilight books. This cultural phenomena of poorly written, poorly acted popularity is nothing short of maddening. But, let's just take a look at this film on its own.Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is a teenage girl who is moving from Arizona to Forks, Washington. She is moving to live with her father because her mother and new husband are moving to Florida and she wants them to have a chance to 'be alone'. (This is our first introduction to the ridiculousness of the character/series. WHAT teenage girl would not only be OK with uprooting her life, but offer to move in with a father she had almost no relationship with?). When she arrives in Forks, it's clear that Bella has an awkward and distant relationship with her father, played just as stiffly by Billy Burke. Bella quickly becomes wildly popular with her unrealistically diverse classmates, who, by their reaction, appear to have never met anyone new. She is also clearly admired by her father's friend's son, Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who lives on an Indian reservation. But Bella has almost no interest in all the boys pining for her affections or girls trying to be her friend. The only person who captures Bella's attention is Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the only young man who seems not only disinterested in her, but seems to dislike her. All the other kids tell Bella that Edward and his adopted siblings are 'weird' and keep to themselves. Jacob even tells Bella that, according to legend, Edward and his family are the 'cold ones' enemies to his tribe, the wolf people.After Edward saves Bella's life by stopping a truck about to hit her with his bare hands, she suspects something even more compelling about him. Oddly enough, no one else notices Edward saved her, and after some internet searches into the mythology of 'cold ones', Bella discovers Edward is a VAMPIRE! She meets with him in the woods and tells him she knows what he is and still wants to be girlfriend. Despite the fact he tries shows her how dangerous, fast, strong, andsparkly he is and that he avoided her because he desperately wants to drink her blood, the two eventually develop a relationship. Bella meets his family, they play 'vampire baseball' and end up having to save her from the 'bad' vampires that actually eat people.The actors in this movie give a terrible performance. Kristen Stewart is completely devoid of emotion and expression. Robert Pattinson, while a good actor in other films, is so stiff it is difficult to watch. Along with that, he struggles to hide his British accent, and the make-up used for the 'Adonis-like' Edward Cullen makes the normally handsome Pattison look ugly. Even if the acting was decent the script and lines are PATHETIC. They are groan worthy, but that is probably due to the poor material they had to work with. As for the plot, it is stupid. It is completely unrealistic, even in terms of being a fantasy. The mythology makes no sense and throughout the series, seems to contradict itself just to make the plot work. Bella Swan is boring, bland and so easy to make fun of it's almost silly. Edward is whiny and annoying. He seems nothing like someone who has been alive for a century, as he still acts like a dumb teenage boy. On top of that, the main vampires have nothing vampiric about them. They only drink the blood of animals, never people, they live in a family setting, they can go into the sunlight and sparkle instead of burn, they have no fangs, they don't have sex before marriage, and they are not scary. As for the romance, there is NO reason the two should be together, or have such intense feelings for each other. The only reason Bella pursues and 'loves' Edward is because she finds him attractive and he seemed disinterested in her. The only reason Edward 'loves' Bella is because she smells good, and her blood is like his 'own personal heroin'. These are very contrived, lame, and somewhat troubling reasons. I must also add that it is clear there is a message of abstinence, especially with Edward controlling himself to both not have sex with Bella, nor drink her blood. Many parents like this message to teen girls, but the fact that it equates Edward having sex with Bella to him killing her, is nothing short of disturbing. Finally, for such a greatly anticipated movie, this film had horrible special effects. This is surely the worst movie I have ever seen, and possibly the worst 'popular' movie ever made.",1,8,11,1 March 2012
Frozen," An honest review without politics getting involved
","This has been one of the most talked about movies in a long time. Are Disney's new princesses feminists? Are there LGBT undertones? Is there a gay family in it? Are the princesses 'strong women'? Let's just look at this loose adaption of Hans Christian Ansderson's 'The Snow Queen'.Elsa and Anna are princesses living in the fictional kingdom of Arrendelle. Elsa is endowed with mysterious powers that allow her to shoot ice and snow from her hands. When she accidentally injures her younger sister Anna with her powers their parents force her to hide and keep herself hidden from Anna and the world. Shortly after their parents die when the girls are teenagers, Elsa has a coronation ceremony. At the party, Anna instantly falls in love with a handsome prince named Hans, and announces to Elsa that she is engaged. This makes Elsa fly into a rage that releases her frosty powers, terrifies the kingdom, and sends Arrendelle into an intense winter during summer. She escapes to the mountains, and Anna rushes after her sister, who she is sure didn't mean to hurt anyone. Anna is aided by a quirky woodsman named Kristoffe, his dog-like reindeer Sven, and a hilarious, living snowman Olaf. Together, they all try to help Elsa, stop the winter, and return Arrendelle to the kingdom it once was.This movie is good. It's cute, it's funny, it has good songs, the animation is done well, and it is entertaining for children and adults alike. 'Let It Go' is one of the best Disney songs I've heard in many years, and Olaf the snowman is the funniest animated character I've seen in ANY animated film in a long time. I am so entirely tired of people obsessing about the feminist and possibly gay undertones/implications of the film, instead of the actual film itself. Point blank, there is nothing damaging about the plot or messages in this film, obviously or subtly. It's not a groundbreaking film, but it's not any step back either. Without giving it away, I will say I was impressed with a plot twist or two towards the end that I really did not expect. That twist itself impressed me not because it was 'progressive', but because it wasn't something I expected from average, predictable Disney films. Its real focus is love, and they do a good job. Like Brave as well, it's focusing more on relationships and love between two female characters rather than a male and female or two males. The only real criticism I have about this film is that, although the animation is good, it is computerized and...has less variety than traditional animation. For example, Elsa and Anna's faces look almost identical to Rapunzel's in Tangled. Also, like Tangled isn't called 'Rapunzel', I'm stupidly annoyed they didn't just call this 'The Snow Queen', but that's a personal thing! All in all, Frozen is a great animated film that almost anyone can enjoy.",9,3,7,21 February 2014
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Excellent Film
","We've all seen dozens of movies about the Holocaust. It makes it all the more refreshing when someone actually finds a new perspective to tell the story from. For once the protagonist is not on the persecuted minorities' side, but on the well to do German side.Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is a happy eight-year-old boy living in Berlin. When his Nazi officer father (David Thewlis) is transferred to a new home closer to a concentration camp, Bruno is upset about leaving his friends. He quickly becomes bored in the isolated country home, and believes the concentration camp he sees from his window is a farm. He is fascinated and confused by why the people there wear 'pajamas', and is determined to find out more about them. His mother (Vera Farmiga) tells him not to go in the back of the house, but Bruno manages to sneak through the woods, and find the edge of the concentration camp. There he meets Schmuel (Jack Scanlon), an eight-year-old Jewish boy living in the camp. The boys become fast friends, and Bruno comes to visit, bringing food and toys as often as he can. Despite the fact he visits a concentration camp, Bruno is still oblivious to what's really going on there. His friendship with Schmuel makes him question the anti-Semitism in his tutor's curriculum and father's military duties. Both young boys learn about friendship, betrayal, loyalty, courage and common decency, with some parents learning harsh lessons as well.This movie is stunning, absolutely wonderful. I have never seen a film set in the Holocaust that was told from a German perspective, and I know I'm not alone in that. While most other films demonize all Germans during WW2, this film depicts the difference between Nazis and the everyday German citizen who was unable to stop the horror happening before them. What I find fascinating is that while the movie is first based off of Bruno's innocence, it slowly morphs into denial as he begins to learn more about his father and new friend. The acting in this film is superb. Asa Butterfield is a fantastic child star. One scene that stands out to me is one where he is dealing with guilt in his bedroom, which is both beautifully acted and realistic. Rupert Friend did a great job as the typical cold-hearted Nazi, and Jack Scanlon also gave a great performance as Schmuel. David Thewlis is great as usual. Unlike other WW2 films this shows the horror of the Holocaust by the people suffering through its tortures, this shows the evil of it through the point of view of people who stood on the sidelines watching it happen. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a great story of friendship, and how children are often braver and more virtuous than adults.",10,1,1,16 October 2012
The Piano," Creepy and Unpleasant
","Academy Awards and the notion of Anna Paquin's first movie intrigued me—so I didn't hesitate to grab a copy of The Piano I found at a garage sale. However I was surprised and even confused with what I saw.Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) is a mute Scottish widow whose only passion is playing her piano. After her father arranges another marriage for her to a man in New Zealand (Sam Neill), she and her young daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) make the long trip to NZ. Once they get there Ada's new husband Alisdair decides that it's too much work to carry her piano through the muddy woods and difficult terrain to his plantation. Ada is devastated at the idea of her beloved piano rotting on the beach, so her relationship with her new husband is off to a rocky start—complicated by the fact she can only communicate with him through signs translated by Flora. Luckily Alisdar's bachelor neighbor George (Harvey Keitel) takes pity on Ada and says he will buy her piano and have it delivered to his house. He tells Ada that he will take payment for the piano in the form of music lessons that she will give him in his home. But the catch is that George doesn't really want music lessons from Adahe wants sexual favors. So as Ada struggles in her new relationship with Alisdar, she continues her, umaffair with George, in order to play her piano. And thus'romance' begins to blossom.You'll notice I just put the word romance in quotes. I did so because I found nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about this film's characters. This movie can be described in one word: Creepy. I was really surprised at the tone, dialogue and events of this film. I expected this to be a secret romance that develops between a lonely bachelor and a woman forced into marriage with a man she hates. In fact, that's what I would say the movie was advertised as. Butthis isn't so much a movie about a secret romance as a movie about sexual harassment, emotional blackmail and I daresay, rape. It was deeply disturbing that this film seemed to romanticize a forced sexual relationship. It's not even like Ada was even attracted to George or seemed trulyhappy or comfortable with him in the beginning or middle of the film. I can't even remember her smiling with him once. The odd thing about this movie is that the acting is excellent, the locations are great, and it looks very appealing. In terms of the film itself, it is very well made. The problem is that the story is awful and Anna Paquin's character was the only one I didn't find despicable at some point. The film left me feeling uncomfortable, confused, and even violated. This is a story that creates extremely uncomfortable situations and evokes uncomfortable emotions in the viewer with little redeeming qualities. On top of that I was very confused about the reason/origin of Ada's muteness, and if she chose not to speak, or physically couldn't. This movie was not a 'bad', but it was one of the most unsavory cinematic experiences I've ever had. If you want a beautiful romance or sexy story, look elsewhere. And I'd suggest counseling for anyone who truly found this film romantic.",5,4,9,2 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," One of the best HP films
","It's the fifth installment of Harry Potter, and the characters are well into their teens. The fourth and final director David Yates has taken over, and brings even more changes.Harry is still reeling from witnessing Voldemort's resurrection and Cedric's murder in the summer, when out of nowhere, dementors attacks him and Dudley. Harry casts a patronus to defend them and takes his dazed cousin home, only to immediately receive a letter saying he has been expelled from Hogwarts for performing underage magic. But that night Harry is rescued by the Order of the Phoenix, a society Dumbledore founded to fight Voldemort. They fly off to the headquarters at Sirius' house, where he is met by the rest of the Order. A trial is held to determine whether or not Harry should be allowed back into Hogwarts, and after the ministry decides to let him back everyone goes back to school. The already distraught Harry is suddenly an outcast, as the ministry is calling Voldemort's resurrection a hoax, and Harry a liar. Lonely and depressed, Harry finds solace in his new friend Luna (Evanna Lynch), an eccentric girl often bullied by other students. Things get more difficult when we meet their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Stauton). Umbridge has been appointed by the Ministry to keep an eye on Dumbledore and enforce the propaganda that Voldemort's return is a lie. Naturally this doesn't set very well with Harry, especially since Umbridge refuses to teach any defensive magic, in favor of theories. After Umbridge manages to take over Hogwarts and enforce excessive rules with painful punishments, Harry, Ron and Hermione develop a secret defensive magic club coined 'Dumbledore's Army', or 'the DA'. Several students join, including Luna, Ginny, Neville (Matthew Lewis) and Harry's love interest Cho Chang (Katie Leung). When there is a jail break at Azkaban and Harry's visions of Voldemort's actions and emotions get more intense, he knows what he must do. Together with Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna, Harry goes to the front lines to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters.This is one of my favorite HP movies. I like the tone, colors, acting and characters (or rather emphasis on certain characters). Yates' direction is much more emotionally motivated, and Harry's pain and struggles are palpable. We get a very good depiction of Harry's new loving relationship with Sirius, as his desire for a father is finally being satisfied. That being said, Sirius' death was absolutely devastating, and it's hard not to cry when you watch Harry's silent scream. The fight scenes in the ministry were pretty awesome, and probably my favorite part of this film. As for the characters, we get a deeper look at Neville. In previous films Neville was just the clumsy, chubby kid who the Slytherins picked on. In this film we see Neville's courage and determination, as well as learn more about his painful past—and how it is a parallel to Harry's. Evanna Lynch as Luna can only be described in one word: perfect! She is strange, sweet, clever, and has a perfect voice for the role. Helena Bonham Carter is equally perfect for the role of Bellatrix Lestrange. She is crazy, volatile, evil and twisted. Katie Leung isokay. She was in Goblet of Fire as well, but I never found her character that interesting or likable. Imelda Stauton does a great job as Umbridge, and while not hideously ugly like in the book, Staunton gives a creepier aspect to this character with her sickeningly sweet performance. I also enjoyed the look into Snape's past, and the audience's realization that Harry's dad was quite a jerk as a teen, and his bullying of Snape is why he resents Harry so much. This film is establishing the connection between Harry and Voldemort, setting it up the next three films. While he brought a lot of great things to this series, Yates has made some visual changes that make the films look very inconsistent. One change that irritated me is Sirius in his dog form was a Scottish Deerhound, as opposed to the black wolf-like dog in the third film (and described in the book). He also changed the garb of the Death Eaters, forfeiting Newell's pointed hoods and skull eye masks for simpler hoods and full faced metallic masks. While many disagree I did like Newell's wardrobe better, especially since it felt reminiscent of KKK hoods and the skull masks reflected the 'death' aspect of the Death Eaters. The film also left out some details, especially about the Ministry, but nothing too damaging to the plot. But these complaints are just nit-picks. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best Harry Potter films, and a strong comeback from the fourth.",9,1,4,10 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The magic begins
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fun and whimsical introduction to the Harry Potter series. While some consider this a weaker part of the series, it truly started the success of the whole franchise.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a neglected ten year old boy who lives with his cruel aunt, uncle and cousin the Dursleys. He is shocked when a gigantic man named Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) appears on his 11th birthday to tell Harry that he is a wizard, and he has come to take him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. As Hagrid takes him to shop for school supplies Harry learns that not only is he a wizard, but the most famous young wizard in the world; his parents were not killed in a car crash, but murdered by an evil wizard named Voldemort. Voldemort tried to murder Harry as an infant, but failed and disappeared, leaving only a lightning shaped scar on Harry's forehead. On the train to school Harry befriends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), a goofy young red head, and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), a clever know-it-all born from 'muggle' (non-magical) parents. When he arrives at school Harry makes enemies just as soon as he made friends, out of an arrogant bully Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and the potions teacher Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Through their first school year Harry, Ron and Hermione learn the basic lessons of a magical education, battle a troll, and Harry even joins the Quidditch team, an exciting sport played on broomstick. As Harry learns more about his past and the Wizarding world, he and his friends hear whispers of Voldemort's attempted resurrection. They suspect he is looking for the Sorcerer's Stone, a gem that will grant eternal life. The kids seek help from the wise and powerful headmaster Dumbledore (Richard Harris), but while he is away from the school the action to protect the Sorcerer's Stone falls into the hands of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.Not only is this a great introduction to Harry Potter, it's a good movie on its own. Admittedly the acting is mediocre, if not a bit poor at some parts with the kids. But considering that both Rupert Grint and Emma Watson had never acted before, and Dan Radcliffe only appeared for a few minutes in other movies, they did a pretty good job. The special effects were decent, and the parts that were not as good were overpowered by the strong magical atmosphere. The set for Hogwarts and Diagon Alley were absolutely AMAZING! They were just how I pictured, and from what I'd heard, just as J.K. Rowling pictured as well. The wardrobe was also done very well. The school uniforms, hats, and outfits of the teachers were fantastic. As for the plot, Columbus definitely tread lightly. This film is probably the closest to the book of any Harry Potter film. Despite some of the lesser acting, I find the atmosphere and storyline of this film to be one of the stronger ones in the series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fun and exciting fantasy that starts fans up for an adventure that will last for years.",8,0,1,30 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Weaker of the series--but still Harry Potter!
","It's year four at Hogwarts for Harry and his friends, and things are starting to go downhill, for both the film and the characters. Mike Newell is now director, and he brings more changes to the series.It's the summer before his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry is having recurring dreams of Voldemort and Wormtail (Timothy Spall). But he is temporarily distracted when he goes to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, the Weasleys, family friend Mr. Diggory, and his son Cedric (Robert Pattinson). Everyone enjoys the match, Ron especially, who is a big fan of the young, Bulgarian seeker Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski). But the match is interrupted by Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters, terrorizing the fans, causing chaos and casting 'the dark mark' in the sky. Everyone is shaken from the events at the World Cup, but the kids go to school and hear some exciting news. Hogwarts will be home to the TriWizard Tournament, a competition between three young wizards from three different schools. According to Dumbledore, the prize will include the TriWizard cup and eternal glory. So, a group of beautiful French girls from the Beauxbatons Acadamy and tough Eastern European young men from Durmstrang Institute arrive at Hogwarts. Dumbledore establishes the rules that no students under age seventeen can apply to the contest by placing their names in the Goblet of Fire. The Goblet then chooses the Tournament's competitors: Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) from Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum from Durmstrang andHarry?! Poor Harry is shocked and confused at this revelation, and the entire school (all three really) are furious at him for 'cheating'. He quickly becomes a media sensation and struggles to get through the dangerous competitions. Luckily though, Harry is helped by the new (and somewhat frightening) Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher 'Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson). On top of putting his life on the line for a competition he doesn't want to be in, Ron isn't speaking with him, and Hermione is also fighting with Ron. Everything is a mess, and Harry must compete in life threatening games, make up with his friends, find a date for the Yule ball, and figure out why he's having so many dreams of Voldemort.This is probably the weakest (or second weakest) of all eight movies. First of all, the direction for this series has become a game of musical chairs. Newell was at a disadvantage following Cuarón, who most fans consider the best HP director. Not only that, the fourth book is the second longest book with so much information that the plot was absolutely butchered. The book was so long that the film makers considered splitting the fourth installment into two movies. That might have been better, because this film is extremely rushed and still leaves a huge amount out. Ironically, this film is shorter than the first two films whose source material was barely half the length of the fourth book. It must be said that this film focuses almost completely on Harry. While he may be the main character, any fans of the books or movies knows that Ron, Hermione and other side characters have just as much to do with the plot as he does. Not only that, but the other competitors, Fleur and Viktor barely have ANY lines or screen time. I don't even remember hearing Fleur say anything except for screaming and one line in French! I also want to know who did the editing in this movie. There are a few scenes where Harry's hair is at least two inches longer/shorter than in the previous scene. Really, did no one have the hindsight to keep his hair a similar length during filming? Even so, didn't anyone think to film things in a way that would look like his hair grew during the year? And while we're on the subject of hair...Radcliffe (and Grint's) hair is absolutely dreadful in this film! I'm usually not one to comment on those things but...wow. But I digress, this film is not ALL bad. It has some great scenes of Harry fighting a dragon and swimming in the Black Lake. The scene in the graveyard with Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) return is probably the best written and acted in the film. Fiennes does a fantastic job as the scary, creepy and power hungry Dark Lord. Luckily they didn't leave out the parts that have to do with his return to power, thus confusing the viewers on later events. As for the other goings on in this film, it does establish that rising adolescent tension between Ron and Hermione the times they are on screen, and even has some sexual innuendos. It's kind of fascinating how the films age with the characters and even audience, as I don't think I've really seen that with any other franchise. While I have criticized this film a lot, that's only because Harry Potter films and books are held in such high regard. It butchered the source material, as well as created a sub-par film—in comparison to the seven others. However, the film itself is not bad in comparison to other films or fantasies. While probably the weakest of the HP franchise, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is still definitely worth watching for Harry Potter fans.",7,0,1,4 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A satisfying second installment
","Harry is back in the second installment of Harry Potter, also directed by Christopher Columbus. Puberty is beginning to start for both the fictional characters and real kids, and they will be forced to be even more daring than before.Harry is anxiously awaiting his return to Hogwarts, desperate to get away from the Dursleys. He is more than surprised when a strange looking creature (a house elf) named Dobby appears in his room to tell him he must not go back to school. Dobby warns that Harry's life will be in danger if he returns, and gets him in enough trouble so that the Dursleys lock him in his bedroom. Luckily Ron and his twin brothers Fred and George (James & Oliver Phelps) rescue Harry in a flying car to take him to their home. Harry feels much more at home in the Weasley house with the warm parents (Julie Walters & Mark Williams) and slew of kids. There are some new faces at Hogwarts this year, including Ron's little sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright), the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), who talks more about himself than the defensive spells, and Draco's equally arrogant father Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs). Harry, Ron and Hermione are still happy to be back in school until some strange things begin to happen, and several residents of the castle become petrified. The explanation is that the legendary 'Chamber of Secrets' is opening again. The Chamber is a hidden tunnel in the castle where one of the four founders of the school, Salazar Slytherinâ€”a known muggle-hater, is said to have hidden a monster that would kill all muggle-born students. The Chamber can only be opened by the heir of Slytherin, and everyone has their own ideas about who that might be. Dumbledore and the other professors are concerned for the safety of their students, and Hogwarts is in danger of being closed. That is of course unless Harry, Ron and Hermione find the Chamber of Secrets, the monster, and the heir who opened it.This is a decent film, and matches well with The Sorcerer's Stone. It is the longest of all eight films at nearly three hours, and can sometimes be hard to sit through all the way. However, the length allows it to be quite loyal to the book which is a definite positive. The acting has clearly improved, especially for Daniel Radcliffe. The audience gets a good establishment for Harry's relationship with the Weasleys and Dumbledore, as well as Ginny's crush on Harry. This is, in my opinion, the only film where Bonnie Wright acts sufficiently. Lucky for the viewers too, because this is probably the film she has the most to do with the plot. Kenneth Branagh is hilarious as Professor Lockhart, and Jason Isaacs also does a good job of playing Lucius Malfoy. Sadly, this is also the last film that Richard Harris is able to play Dumbledore. For many fans, Harris is the superior Dumbledore and I would have to agree. His whimsy, expressions and subtle humor are done so naturally it's almost like the role was written for him. The set and wardrobe are the same from the year before, and still fantastic. The plot is carried over well, the new characters fit in great, and the kids are truly becoming Harry, Ron and Hermione. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a good follow up to the first film.",8,0,1,31 March 2012
Stranger Than Fiction," Original movie about literature and what makes life worth living
","Stranger Than Fiction is a different sort of movie. It's a comedy/drama/romance that questions the lines of fiction and non-fiction, without using the cliché 'fourth wall' tactics. It answers a question many writers have often wondered, 'what if my characters where real?' Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson) is a struggling author who is working on a new book chronicling the life of a man called Harold Crick (Will Ferrell). Harold is a rather boring IRS agent who lives a very strict, regimented life without much recreation or friends. Eiffel believes that Harold is her own creation, but he is in fact a real person—who has begun hearing her narrating his life! Believing he is losing his mind, Harold seeks out help from a literature professor Dr. Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman) in hopes he will tell him what book he is in. Meanwhile, with the help of her witty assistant Penny (Queen Latifah) Eiffel is trying to figure out how to end her book with Harold's death . Harold tries to live as normally as he can, but Karen has other plans for him, as he suddenly finds himself falling for anarchist baker Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he was sent to audit. Dr. Hilbert discovers Eiffel is the author of Harold's story and breaks the bad news to him that she is a tragedy writer, and all of her protagonists die. Harold then tries to find the author and convince her to let him live.This is one of those movies that manages laughs and a warm fuzzy feeling without feeling sappy. The characters are different and quite memorable. This is one of the only movies, if not THE only movie I enjoy Will Ferrell's acting. In Stranger Than Fiction he is not shouting for no reason or engaging in immature slapstick. This film has more intellectual, dry humor. The romance is sweet and flows well, and the conflict for Harold's life will keep the audience wondering and hoping. I also liked the chemistry and funny interactions between Karen and her assistant Penny. It's a good story that talks about what the real meaningful things in life are. A great film.",10,0,0,5 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A Bittersweet Goodbye
","This is it, the end of an era. The last Harry Potter movie, and Harry's last stand against Voldemort. So is the last film a triumphant end or disappointment for the world's most famous wizard? Voldemort has the elder wand. Harry, Hermione, and Ron nearly escaped the Death Eaters with Luna, Mr. Olivander (John Hurt) and Griphook (Warwick Davis) the goblin with the help of Dobby—who sadly did not survive. After finding out information from Mr. Olivander and Griphook, Harry, Ron and Hermione go to Gringotts Bank with Hermione disguised as Bellatrix. They are convinced Bellatrix has at least one horcrux in her vault. After successfully getting the Hufflepuff cup from the vault Harry gets intense visions of Voldemort's reaction, and information that another horcrux is in Hogwarts. Despite fearing Snape in the headmaster's position, the three heroes apparate into Hogsmeade. When alarms go off from their arrival, they are sheltered by Dumbledore's disgruntled brother Aberforth (Ciaran Hinds) in his bar. While Aberforth grumpily tells them they are doomed, a very battered Neville arrives though a secret passageway to bring them to the castle. Once inside Hogwarts the war between good and evil begins. Snape and other Death Eaters are driven out, while Harry, the Order and Hogwarts' staff and students do their best to protect the school. Harry, Ron and Hermione must then fight the Death Eaters, find and destroy the remaining horcruxes, while Harry learns the truth about Snape, himself, and battles Voldemort for the last time.This movie suffered a lot, I mean A LOT from the failures of the sixth film. So much information about the horcruxes and a few other subjects had been omitted that any viewer who has not read the books (or even not read them recently) will no doubt be confused. You can even tell how they cut out an enormous amount of info by the very long FAQ on this movie about 'how the book is different'. The pacing for this film was very rushed, which made some of the missing information even more confusing. This isn't the best of them all as it is hailed. I think people just call it that because they expected and wanted this to be the best. It really glosses over the deaths of all the characters, with maybe one getting more than a few seconds of 'mourning'. And it must be said that the make-up for the epilogue was so laughably pathetic that it's hard to watch. Really, the people that did the make-up for goblins, Mad-Eye and other fantastic creatures couldn't age the characters 20 years? They might as well have just gotten older actors that looked like them than give this poor excuse of make-up. Harry and Ron were somewhat passable, but they did nothing to age Ginny and Hermione except give them more 'adult' hairstyles and dress! That being said, this is still a good movie, and a fairly good finale to Harry Potter. The fight/action scenes were very exciting. The magnitude of the Death Eater army was very well depicted. I must say that Snape's memories were fantastic, especially since I was worried about them butchering or ruining this aspect of the series. It was very meaningful to the series, and satisfying to those who read this part in the book. I'm really tearing this movie apart here, but I should add again that it IS a good movie. I wasn't disappointed in the movie as a whole, but I was disappointed in some aspects. I loved the Gringotts scenes and flashbacks. The best part was definitely from the Snape's memory until the end, as the pace also slowed down a bit for the viewers to absorb what was going on. This is a decent finale to the Harry Potter phenomena, and a difficult goodbye to the billions of fans all over the world.",7,0,2,29 April 2012
