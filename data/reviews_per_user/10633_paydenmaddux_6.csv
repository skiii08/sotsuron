It," This movie was great. What is wrong with all you people.
","This movie was really well done. The beginning scene where IT kills Gorge kills me. It's just a little kid and it's just so sad. I have one problem with this movie, and that I hope IT chapter 2 will fix. The lack of pennywise. I didn't like how he was always teasing the kids. It was funny, and kinda scary to. But I wish we could have gotten more into him. Explore his character. The acting was fricking amazing. Bill skarzgard was THE highlight of the film. He was perfect. All the kids were amazing (a lot better than the tv mini series ). Over all, this movie was amazing. Loved every moment. Watch it. And screw all you other people in the comments who don't think this was a very good movie",10,0,0,7 October 2019
The Conjuring 2," This is the best conjuring movie in the whole franchise.
","I loved this movie. The characters, the Heart felt moment, the scares, it was all amazing. The first one was good as well, but I think this one was better. I get to see more of the people and why I should care about them. Like the wife, she has no husband, she is miserable, and I just have to feel bad for that. And the inevitable feeling Lorain has that Ed is going to die is also really nice. She tries to the very end to make sure it doesn't happen, and it doesn't. Great films. One of my favorite horror films ever made. 10/10",10,0,1,1 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Amazing action, acting, and story.
","Wile it does have time plot holes, it is still a AMAZING MOVIE. It is amazingly sad. It deserves to be the highest grossing movie ever. And absolute need to see!!!",10,2,7,21 June 2019
Gone with the Wind," Absolutely horrible
","This movie sucked. Sure. Red butler was funny at times, and I loved the way he kept on proving the girl wrong and roasting her. But that's it. I HHHHHAAAAAAAATTTTTEEEEE the going back and forth to red and Ashley. It was stupid how scarlet only chose red for the money. I hate how they we're always like,' I love you,' next scene,' I killed your baby!!!!' Worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life",1,5,12,10 August 2019
Clash of the Titans," Not the worst movie ever.
","This movie was fun. It wasn't like, endgame, or John wick or anything, but it was decent for what it has. I wish they could have just made another Percy Jackson film instead, but instead they made this. It has good action, good acting performance, and good cgi. Not much in the way of plot, but a good movie. Sort of",7,0,1,21 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It deserves the win for most disappointing film.
","This movie was a let down. I'm not saying they didn't anything other than what they could have, because why I liked the first one was because I felt like one of the kids. And that scared me. Penny wise in the first one was a lot more scary, which again, they couldn't really help. I would like to give this movie grief, but I just keep coming back to the realization that they couldn't have done anything more with it really. That acting by bill hader was amazing. Never seen his actor until now, but I'm a fan now. Penny wise, while not as scary, still great. Spoiler right here. She the little girl goes under the bridge, and penny wise eats her, it breaks my heart. It really reminds me of the scene in the first one where gorge dies. While not as good, like everything in this movie, still sad. To describe this move in a short sentence, acting great, plot was meh, but they couldn't really do anything about it. Watch it, understand what I mean.",6,0,0,30 December 2019
