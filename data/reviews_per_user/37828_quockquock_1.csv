Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Padme's hair.
","You've heard all the negatives of this and that, but Padme Amidala's hair and costumes were ridiculous. On what planet do people do this? Naboo I guess, but even in outer space a long long time ago, who would come up with this? Ridiculous! And I get that Padme had a stand in wearing her hair like that most of the movie, but geez, in two consecutive scenes her hair was all decorated from side to side with sequins, and beads etc... then a few hours later in the same day, her hair is all fixed up with some strange apparatus from front to back. Just silly George Lucas. What a waste of time and money!",1,2,6,6 January 2020
