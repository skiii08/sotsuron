The Ring," Good horror-thriller!
","Gore Verbinski is a good director, I loved The Mexican and MouseHunt too. I think that he was a good choice. I loved this movie better than the original Ringu (8/10). The acting was very good, Naomi Watts is a very good actress, everybody will enjoy this movie who really wants. In my opinion: 9 out of 10.",10,0,0,25 November 2002
X-Men," Good movie!
","I love this movie. It is good directed, and all actors have great performance in X-Men. I loved the soundtrack: Michael Kamen is a god, he has been made a good music for this movie. My favourite mutant is: all of them... they are so unique, and if you love the movie, you will love them all (the good guys and also the bad guys). 10 out of 10!",10,0,0,26 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," What the hell.....?
","Ok, sorry... I have made a very BAD mistake. This movie is terrible, Okay.. I liked it first... second. But this is a boring movie, not the second best Star Wars movie (as I said before), this is not a Star Wars movie: this is 'how to show CGI for people' movie (okay... this was terribly funny:). The original trilogy is wonderful, the last two (or soon three) is just sucks. Lucas, please do not direct movies anymore!!! 4/10",4,1,2,23 June 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Horrible!
","I think The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions was a huge mistake of Hollywood. It terrible, this movie is not serious (the first and the Animatrix was). Well.. it's sh*t! I don't understand why American film makers always want to destroy their best movies (OK, they want more and more money). Don Davis's music is good again, but that's it.I prefer to watch Kill Bill, that movie is a real movie!Animatrix 9/10 The Matrix 8/10 The Matrix Reloaded 2.5/10 The Matrix Revolutions 2/10Do not watch this horrible movie!!!",5,0,0,8 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," No Cameron... that means this is a: Great Movie
","Yeah, this is a wonderful movie, I like it a lot. Jonathan Mostow (yes, he is a lot better than the 'king of the world') is a god, he made a better Terminator film, than James Cameron ever made. This movie is a lot better than the first two: better script, better music, better actors (except Arnold, he is good again:) and better directing. Cameron (Hey, you! Go to the cinema and go to practice from Mostow!) fans will do not like this movie, but who cares... It was really good to wait 12 years for this fantastic movie!!! The only problem with the movie: it is a little bit short for me. :-)T1 6/10, T2 9.5/10, T3 10/10.",8,0,0,12 July 2003
Spider-Man," The most impressive comic book-adaptation ever!
","'With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility'... those who cannot understand these words they will not like the movie. Spider-Man is the best comic hero of all time! I bought the DVD Tuesday and I like the moive better and better... When I first heard that my favourite director, Sam Raimi will direct the new Spidey-movie, I was very happy. Danny Elfman' score, the acting and everything is beautiful. The only bug is the CGI, sometimes it is not so good. This is 2002s best movie. In my opinion: 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,9 November 2002
X-Men: The Last Stand," I hate Brett Ratner or how to destroy a movie franchise!
","I read so many negative and positive critics everywhere (mostly here on IMDb) and sorry, but I agree with the negative ones. This movie is bad... very bad. I like the first two episodes and now I feel almost the same thing when I saw Batman Forever after Batman Returns. Okay, the situation is not that bad. ;) In X3 there are a lot of weird things like unimportant and unfinished characters and story. The directing was bad and Brett Ratner is a coward. He MUST kill all mutants and not because those mutants can die too, no... it is because he (and Fox) wants to make a fourth movie with no characters. Good luck for them next time, I will watch the next X-Men movie too, but please, bring back Bryan Singer and apologize him.5/10",5,0,2,26 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Could this be better? That is the question!
","Could this be better? Yes, the Extended Version will be better, we just have to wait a few months. I love this movie, I enjoyed this movie. Gollam is the best character in the movie (but I like the others too). The CGI is beautiful, the Ents are the most intresting 'tree's of the world. :) I loved the TTT soundtrack better than FoTR (10/10). Its more dinamic, more fantastic than the prequel. The sequel is here, go to the cinema as fast as you can! Don't miss it!!! 10 out of 10",10,0,0,29 December 2002
The Descent," 'Creep 2'
","My opinion is... that this is the unofficial second Creep (2003) movie which starred by the beautiful Franka Potente. The reasons are: while Creep played in a subway station, this movie (The Descent) plays in a cave. In this movie, there are a lot of people with lot of monsters (or whatever are they), in Creep, there is only one. Let's talk only about the positives: the director of photography and the directing was all great and unique, absolutely awesome, I liked it so much. I don't really liked Neil Marshall's previous film, called Dog Soldiers, but I enjoyed this one. I think it is a one time watchable horror film to everyone who really likes this movie genre.",3,2,3,10 December 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Waste of time! :(
","I love the first Matrix (9/10) movie, but I think..... I think I hate this sh*t. The only good thing in the movie when Neo was fight with thousands of Mr. Smith. There was nothing special in the movie except this moment (and I think that it was too long). Zion is a stupid place, there are no white people? What is happening here (I do not hate anybody but this is funny, isn't it?)? I hope The Matrix Revolutions will be a lot better than this one because as I said before: THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME!!! 4/10",6,0,0,23 June 2003
