One Hundred and One Dalmatians," The Best Disney Movie
",101 Dalmations is my number one most loved Walt Disney movie of all time. I remember watching it for the first time with my sister and my dad and we thought it was very special. The scene where the puppies just kept getting born with more and more of them all over the kitchen and house was so exciting to us we couldn't believe how many puppies had been born. The dog characters were all great and we loved the couple who owned the dogs and the maid. Cruella de Ville is the best Disney villain of all time in my opinion too she is so evil and insane and gets a great come upping in the end. Her henchman are pretty funny and scary at the same time too. Any kid would love watching this Disney movie it is one of the best.,10,5,6,5 January 2014
