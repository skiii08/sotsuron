Lucky Number Slevin," Very Entertaining
","When i was reading through the comments below, i was really disappointed by the comments and reviews people gave. They just don't understand the purpose of this movie. It is true that this movie doesn't contain any moral values, but the question is, SO WHAT? A good movie doesn't have to teach us morals or give us a lesson. Since when do you guys watch movies to learn about morals? Even though it will be advantageous to watch a movie that has a message, it is not required for a good movie. The reason why i give this movie 10/10 is because the plot was very witty and entertaining. The ending was very unpredictable and very satisfying. It is one of those movies that you will not understand the whole plot or the genius of the movie till the end. It's the very end that makes the movie exceptional. In most movies, you will be able to guess the ending, or the ending won't be that shocking. But this movie brings out a different approach. It is only one of its kind, so if you like movies that keeps you thinking, you don't want to miss this one.",10,7,10,8 February 2009
