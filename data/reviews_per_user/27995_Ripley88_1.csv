Alien 3," Totally misunderstood
","Aliens. The definitive Scifi action film ever made. How do you even come close to delivering the same brilliance. You Can't. Alien 3 is not an easy film to like. After the Assault on the senses of ALIENS it came as a real downer. Dark. Very, Very dark. I saw Alien 3 when it came out. i was the only person in the audience of a cinema that held 1500 people. David fincher delivered the most unflinching piece of urban decay in a scifi setting ever made. People did not like this film because it was so dam different. A prison colony? Monks? No females? no sex (on screen)? no female claddly dressed.? no hicks? no, well fun ride. Its not meant to been. Alien 3 is one of the most visually exciting films ever shot. Acting is brilliant, especially the underrated Charles s dullton and Clarke's dance. its foreboding look, textures and the Alien its self are really a masterpiece. No its not Aliens, nor Citizen Kane, but a REAl Alien film. Dark and Depressing. Something different. Look at it is for what it is and not anything else. A beautiful film that is part of ALien legacy. Yes ALIEN RESURRECTION did ruin it as it did NOT have to happen and ALIENS will always be my Favorite film EVER. Howeever Alien 3 Has every right to be along side its prequels and truly is a very misunderstood film of our film.",10,2,9,28 December 2006
