Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This Movie Rocks
","First let me start by saying that I am a huge SW fan. However I am not basing this review on that alone. I think that it is safe to say that well over half of the people in the country will go to see this movie, after all no other movie has been half as anticipated as this one. Many critics did not like this movie, but I say screw them. The character development might not have been as good as the originals, but that did not take away from the movie in the least. The action was fast-paced and the special effects were out of this world! Although many might not like it it truly lives up to the Star Wars name.",10,1,1,22 May 1999
