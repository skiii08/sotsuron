Scarface," My All Time Fav Film
",This film is my all time favourite though i have not seen Godfather which is also supposed to be a unique film . The film is a very good outlook at the drug scene back in the 80's and also how greed can take over anyones life. The rise of Montana is an epic one but so also is his downfall. As he is told early on in the film ' Don't get high on your own supply' which is ironic as this is exactly what he does and he pays the consequnces for it. Brian De Palma directed this film to perfection and is probably his best film. People say that it is too violent though i believe the violence is appropriate to the plot of the film. People may disagree with what i have said but this is my opinion so if anyone would like to discuss this film or any other just write back.,10,1,2,30 September 2004
