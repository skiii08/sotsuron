First Man," Death of a Hero
","As one who badgered the owner of a caravan site, where I was at the time of the moon landing, to lend me the key to the television room so I could watch the landing at some silly time of the UK night, I was dissapointed with this film.The film destroyed my image of Neil Armstrong, making him out to be sullen and not what you would call a family man. What man wouldn't want to talk to his kids before he leaves home to go to the moon? Neil Armstrong may have been exactly as depicted in First Man, but surely this could have been moderated to save his reputation with many people, especially when so many other things were omitted, changed or drowned out with sound effects.The sound effects were too loud which meant any of the conversations between the crew and ground control could not be heard. The famous conversation about the computer codes and the fuel warning count was missing entirely, or just lost in the engine noise which was not on the original 1969 soundtrack.All in all a very dissapointing film and actually worse than the film Apolo 11 from a few years ago.Not worth the trip to the cinema.",5,2,3,31 December 2018
