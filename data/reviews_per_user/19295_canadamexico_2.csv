3:10 to Yuma," Good movie for the comic book crowd, boys aged 10-14
","I would like to give an example but I guess that would be a spoiler. Let's just say I was not able to find this story believable for most of the movie and I wondered what the point of watching it goes. Simply play a game of paint ball and see what you can really get away with in a fire fight. Not much! That being said I love the spaghetti westerns that Clint Eastwood did. When Clint cut the hanging rope from 1000 yards it was a bit hard to believe of course.I guess they can get a way with a bit of a stretch to make a story but 3:10 went way overboard. I think if IMDb didn't force the reviews to be so long you would be reading a lot more negative ones. I could have just written This is a typical Hollywood production that has been done a thousand times before. Many times during it I felt like I was watching for the 100th time. Help, someone get me outa here.",3,3,7,7 October 2007
The Hangover," So Juvenile and awful it really is beyond my comprehension.
","I use the F word on occasion, I like Curb Your Enthusiasm which is loaded with curses and pretty bad ones but they don't seem to grate...I mean really really GRATE!!! The dialogue assault was like a jet engine in your living room for pain to your ears. Other than that the plot was totally juvenile and pitifully inane. I can only think the people who liked this movie are the same people who poop on the seats of public toilets. I don't understand the amusement they got from this flick. Change 2 letters from the last word and that is the word the director would have insisted on solely for the sake of saying it for the 1400th time. Really it was painful and strangely enough we are probably not allowed to use the most common language of the movie to review the movie. If we were I probably would use it to make a point. Even Lenny Bruce could not have saved this f*k, (thats short for flick of course, and I am not LOL about anything). To sum it up A. People rate this flick high.B. I really don't understand people.",1,7,15,18 January 2010
