Lucky Number Slevin," This movie has great wallpaper!
","Congratulations to Suzanne Cloutier and Normand Robitaille on set design - they added great elements of style to this movie. (I don't think I've ever noticed wallpaper in a movie until seeing this one. I find that interesting.) The two penthouse office/apartment sets were amazing. Beyond the sets, this was a finely done movie, in general. The story, although a bit predictable, was one of the better suspense stories I've seen. The music and camera work added a great deal to the overall style, as well. I can see in the current day of action thrillers why this did not get quite as much attention as some; but, it is most definitely memorable.",8,1,3,24 February 2007
