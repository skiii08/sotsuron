The Ring," Is it really that scary? Nah~
","I watched the original Japanese film.  The ideas are intriguing.  But I still don't understand why it became so popular in Asia as the scariest film.  Maybe the atmosphere and sound effect (mostly silent) in the film were too much for people to take.  Personally I don't get the fear it supposedly presents, and surely it was not that memorizing.  So, maybe you watch this film in midnight; and then suddenly the phone rings... so what?! Afraid of someone climb out your TV set and take your life?!  Then the ring series came out, still the same, paid more attention to the story than the fear.  And now there is a remake version of it?  with similar story?  Come on, I don't see how it will get any better (maybe to the first-timers. But that is.)",Null,0,0,8 October 2002
