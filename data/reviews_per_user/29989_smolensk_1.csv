Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," special
","Cohen is the Michelangelo of comedy. Perhaps due to the change of director there are some glitches in the filming. Logic goes missing. When Borat talks into the camera is it a Spinal Tap moment or a soliloquy? Pity....cant tell... so one is dragged out of the pleasurable experience. Most impressive is the discomfort Cohen puts himself through to make this film.... Beckett puts his characters in mounds of sand, Cohen nearly swallows a co-star's balls. Genius. The actor who plays Azamat gives what is probably the greatest 'enabling' performance in the history of comedy. Who knows what he has done before but it cant possibly match the contribution he makes here. His genius matches Cohen's... with the special exception that he was not part of the creative process. Nevertheless without this character's total believability, Cohen - Cambridge-polished - will gag at such a word - the film would have missed an important ingredient. Perhaps this great comedy will introduce the sort of hard-hitting 'entertainment' which will expand the horizons of narrow thinkers.",9,1,6,15 December 2006
