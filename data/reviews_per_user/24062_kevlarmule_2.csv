The Ring," Yes, we know it's a remake
","I just saw The Ring (just released in England) and I'm pretty disappointed in some people and their responses. They've seen the original, liked it a lot and then disliked the remake because it's a remake of something they hold close. But if all the nay-sayers actually took a step back from the Japanese version and took the 2002 effort on it's own, it is a very good, very effective thriller/horror. Just because it's not as good as the original doesn't meant that it's not any good.",Null,0,0,25 February 2003
Se7en," Doesn't play by the rules...and that's a good thing
","This doesn't give away anything in the film, but it might hint at thingsThe reason when 'Seven' (aka Se7en) should be ranked so highly is because it's a film that purely refuses to give into the Hollywood system. Firstly, it never shows you the crimes taking place, opting instead to show you the aftermath. And even then it never pushes it right into your face. It's more reliant on the audiences reaction within itself, within each individual viewer, which is far more powerful than a thousand special effects. Secondly, the ending (and not giving anything away) completely catches you off guard. It is like nothing you expected, and by obeying the rules it has already set out for itself (see above) it makes it all the more scarier. Coupled with the fact that the studio wanted to go with an alternative happy ending (for 'happy' see conventional) and Fincher fought for his vision makes this a true rarity in cinema today.",10,0,0,22 August 2002
