50 First Dates," Sweet romantic comedy
","I was surprised at this film. I didn't expect to like anything of Adam Sandler's, and the premise seemed too much like 'Groundhog Day,' but I loved it. Adam Sandler is quite restrained in this film, as is Drew Barrymore. The supporting cast throw some bones to the puerile Sandler fans, leaving the two leads to show a very convincing romance brewing in a somewhat far-fetched scenario. The writers took care with motivation and characterization for the leads which makes the cardboard characters that fill out the cast really fall flat. Nevertheless, some of the jokes are quotable, like 'You needed a fish-slap to calm down' and 'aquariums make me super-horny' and they define 'comedic relief,' keeping the film from becoming maudlin in several places. The animal stuff (Sandler's character is an aquatic vet) is cute and make for some great shots, like when dolphins leap in the background as Sandler & Barrymore share one of many first kisses. The Hawaiian locale is gorgeous and it's a logical choice (where else could someone believe that every day is October 13th?) I think if it could be compared to another romantic comedy, 'Overboard' with Goldie Hawn & Kurt Russell would come close. The story arc is similar, and amnesia is the main plot device. Kurt Russell's character is similar to Adam Sandler's, too -- seemingly crude in the beginning but with the proverbial heart of gold that comes to light through true love. Awwwww Grab a hankie & enjoy.",9,0,0,8 July 2006
