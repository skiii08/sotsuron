Mission: Impossible III," The Best Of The Series So Far
","Not being a big fan of the first film, and only mildly enjoying the second film (I worked on it so much of the enjoyment was gone) I found this MI film to be undoubtedly the best of the series so far, although it would be good if the recurring theme of traitor agents was finally let go of. While the twists are sometimes predictable,this movie was action packed. The stunts were eye popping and the action fast,The story was fast paced and not as convoluted as the previous two.I really can't understand why it wasn't as successful as hoped, I mean the couch jumping incident aside Tom Cruise is a gifted actor and a fan favourite I don't see why his personal quirks should've affected his box office.All in all an enjoyable couple of hours.Much better than War Of the Worlds I think",7,0,4,5 February 2007
