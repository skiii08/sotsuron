Alien 3," Feeble, disjointed
","There is one scene in this movie that ultimately made me hate it. It's where Charles Dance's character gets killed. I must say that up to that moment I was getting by on the great cinematography, and actually getting into the whole sombre mood.We had gotten to know Charles's doctor as a guilt-ridden man with blood on his hands who is trying to redeem himself. He was presented as a soul-mate of sorts for Ripley. Hey, they even made love in a rather tender scene.Then out of nowhere drops an alien which in a wink of an eye simply kills him. I mean, if he's going to be killed so off-handedly, WHY BOTHER giving him so much time to built up a relationship? And the warm atmosphere just ripped away like a bad joke.

Lucky Number Slevin," Not bad but writers need to try harder
","The twist and reveal plot is definitely entertaining but all in all, it feels like a lesser effort trying to ape non-linear action-thriller hits like Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels, etc. The way this film reveals important pieces of the puzzle through flashbacks is inferior to the above examples because they feel more like 'the butler did it' cop-outs instead of integral story moments... again, these are signs of a not-so-well thought out script.Another element that isn't strong enough to warrant a 'keeper' rating of 7 or better: weak dialogue. It's all very mundane and nothing really makes you feel the characters are interesting individuals with their own motivations. Nothing really dark or menacing to drive up the tension (the set-up murder was OPERATIC in the victims' hysteria and emotional), and hardly any comedic moments, except those meant to play off Mr Slevin's 'I'm a nice guy, why are you doing this to me?' schmuck facade.This one does better than the other try-hard movie in my book - THE BIG HIT - purely because the director and actors are more confident and capable. They saved the writer(s), really.",6,7,14,4 November 2006
The Patriot," Good for one viewing only
","Entertaining enough, with a wicked villain to really tweak youremotion buttons. But the most vivid memory I had was of the'happy interlude' when our heroes reunited with their loved onesat the village and Heath Ledger decided, 'Heck, we may be at war -but I still wanna get married!'. Perfect setup for the tragedy thatfollows soon after (ahem, the burning church... newly weddedbride included.)I won't be watching this again on DVD anytime soon.",6,0,1,30 January 2001
Mystic River," Overhyped and unsatisfying
","What did the critics see in this? I'm totally with the nay-sayers! I kept expecting a plot revelations from the way Dave confronted Sean during his interrogation... like maybe the 'truth' as shown in the beginning of the film is actually a fabrication... that perhaps there was a GOOD REASON for both Jimmy and Sean to hate Dave. I kept speculating during the movie that maybe all 3 kids were abducted, but that only Dave managed to escape... It was all for nothing in the end. Dave was a victim twice over for nothing. Jimmy didn't have to pay for his sins. Sean caught the killers but still didn't do his job right.
Unsatisfying.",5,0,0,22 February 2004
