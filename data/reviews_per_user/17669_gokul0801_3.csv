The Lobster," What was the point of this weird movie?
","I thought it was going to be a dark comedy, but it quickly turned into a twisted tale, with unsavory characters, that dragged on and on for two hours, along with annoying background music.
The lead character showed no emotion, just robotic way of expressing himself, probably instructed by the director to act in that way.
And the plot itself is totally absurd and regressive. Seemed more like a dystopian past, not future.",4,2,3,8 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Terrible
",Another disaster from netflix/hollywood. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams? It was so cringy i turned it off in 30 mins. They couldnt get any euro stars to play the leads? just insulting to the icelandic people.,2,6,19,29 June 2020
Bird Box," Garbage movie
",I got bored an hour into the movie. Didnt care for any of the characters. Sandra Bullock is so annoying.,2,3,5,26 January 2019
