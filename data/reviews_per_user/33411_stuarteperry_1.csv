Saturday Night Fever," good
","I am black man who was 16 or 17 and I was in a integrated high school in Brooklyn when I went to see this movie in 1977. I did not know any white kids in their family life, but I knew a lot of white kids especially Italians from the neighborhood betrayed in this movie. I thought the way he talked and the way they dressed was true to many of my classmates. The leather jackets, the hairstyles and the Brooklyn accents were excellent.The nerd character was a bit of Hollywood, the chance of Tony and his other friends hanging with him is unlikely and just for storyline.From the outside looking in. I thought the Tony character acted like at least three or four people that I knew from school at the time. I thought it was much better acting than his Barbarino character in Welcome Back Kotter.",8,1,2,2 September 2013
