Sucker Punch," Neither love nor hate
","Visually stunning, interesting, & action packed......yes. Little dialog, mediocre acting, sloppy story line, & bizarre........indeed. I think this film will come down to personal taste. Its great for it's production values but poor for everything else (my opinion). As another member stated, it's like a 120 min music video. That doesn't mean its bad, just not my taste. Where I don't feel cheated in any way by watching it, I have no interest in seeing it again. If you like watching sexy women in an action film then go for it. If you like good acting and strong story line then I'd stay away. Thus the rating of 5. It's a take it or leave it for me.",5,1,2,17 July 2012
