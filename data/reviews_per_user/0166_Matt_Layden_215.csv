Angels & Demons," Better Than Da Vinci Code
","Robert Langdon is back in the sequel that is based on the first book. This time Langdon is brought on to a case in the Vatican, there has been a murder. Langdon must help solve a bunch of riddles and clues to make sure a terrorist plot does not ensue.The Da Vinci code was met with unsatisfied reactions. Hank's hair was a big thing in the media and it overtook the film, since he was such a deadpan character in the first one. He fares a little better here, but it's still kind of ho-hum. The better book of the two is also the better film of the two. Angels and Demons has many problems and I almost forgot I even watched it today, which isn't a good sign. But it is tighter, has a better narrative and feels more suspenseful. There are tons of stuff missing from the film, as expected. The plot revolves around the capture four cardinals, Langdon must find them all and save them before they are executed every hour. The Illuminati are behind it, who have hired an assassin to kill each one using one of the four elements, earth, water, fire, air. Each one has the word branded into their skin. The clues in this one seem to flow a little better than Da Vinci and gone are the stupid CGI lettering techniques. The cast is weaker though, Ewan McGregor is a bore. Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with Langdon and is weaker than Tautou. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is really the only one who had my attention. He was more of an interesting character than the lead. The plot is predictable, even for people who have not read the book and the actions that happen on the screen are laughable sometimes. Specifically the stuck in the book records scene and the parachute scene. Both had me giggling while I rolled eyes and the lunacy. The production wasn't allowed to film in a lot of the Cathedrals, it is painfully obvious is a lot of the scenes. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie it was so bad (the prequels, obviously). The assassin is nowhere as interesting as Silas, he was never given the chance to be. Important relationships are left out of the script and overall the film is really, like I said, forgettable.Despite all this, the film's rating reflects the good aspects of it. The Da Vinci Code got a 6 from me, so I can't give it that. 6.5 maybe, or a 7? It was certainly the better film of the two since they knew better the second time. Maybe these books just weren't made to be made for the screen? In any event, Angels and Demons is a mediocre film, with a decent rating from me.",7,0,0,17 May 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Death List Five....Complete
","Finally got to see Vol 2, the conclusion to a long journey that the Bride was taken.First of all let me just say that if you are going into this film to see the violence that Vol 1 had, you'll be disappointed big time, this movie is heavy on the dialogue, that being sad, that would have to be one of the weak points in the film, too many scenes where Bill and The Bride are just talking. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Tarantino Dialogue, I was laughing 50% of the time through the movie, based on the brilliant dialogue that Tarantino puts in everyone of his films. David (Bill) was awesome, he was perfect for the role, he IS BILL, no one else can play bill, he has the perfect voice, the perfect look, and the perfect humour for it, I loved every minute he was on the screen. Another character I loved every time he was on the screen....Pai-Mei (sp). He was great, awesome comic relief for an intense film, which leads me to my second disappointing part. NOT ENOUGH PAI-MEI, and what a sh*tty way to die, this guy is the mother f*cking guy to kick your ass with his finger, this guy will f*ck you up, and he dies from food poison?? That was really lame for me, although the small amount of screen time he did have, was great.This leads me into my third disappointment, the way Budd dies. Again at the hands of Elle (same as Pai-Mei) and she doesn't actually kill either of them (Budd=snake, Pia-Mei=poison) Come on b*tch, Budd was a great character and kicked some ass too, he has balls to bury her alive and we get to see no fight between the two? Which leads me into my final disappointment of the film, talking about fighting...no final battle between The Bride a.k.a Black Mamba a.k.a Mommy a.k.a Beatrix Kiddo. and Bill? As soon as he told her at the camp fire scene about the heart explosion, I knew that is how Bill would die and I wanted yo see some blood, but he just falls down, that all disappointed me. BUT!!! The movie is so good, that all that disappointment doesn't take the film down that much.This movie felt more like a Tarantino movie than the first Vol did, and that's a good sign. The fight scene between The Bride and Elle was great, didn't expect the eye pluck part, then to top it off, she STEPS ON THE EYE (laughed me ass off when the question mark came up on her name in the credits). I felt bored at one scene, the talking of the fish dying, other than that, this film had me cheering for the Bride (and Budd for some reason). So see this flick not to see Vol 1's 'orgy of blood', to finish the movie, see a great Tarantino flick and see some awesome acting.",8,0,1,14 February 2005
Vertigo," Warrants Another Viewing From Me.
","I'm going through some Hitchcock. I was really impressed with the simplicity of Dial M For Murder, now I've seen to go to the opposite side and taken a look at Hitchcock's most ambitious project, Vertigo.Using different lighting and colour schemes along with inventive camera techniques, Vertigo is highly regarded as one of, if not the, best Hitchcock film. Which is weird to me because if you were to ask anyone what they think his best film is, you'll get a variety of different answers. My takeaway is a little difficult. I'm still wrestling with this film because I was so utterly bored with the first half that I was seriously questioning why this film is so highly regarded. Then the halfway point hits and it instantly got me hooked. It demands you to look at the film in a different light and repeat a viewing. So how do I feel about that? I still don't know. What I do know is that this is NOT my favourite Hitchcock film.John Ferguson, a retired detective, is asked by an old friend to follow his wife. He suspects her of being 'possessed' by her great great grandmother, who committed suicide at the young age of 26. The man's wife is 26 and is afraid she might do the same. While following her, John becomes obsessed and will do anything to make sure she stays safe...from herself.I knew nothing about this film, so this supernatural element threw me for a loop. As I said before, the first half is slow and mundane to the point of insanity. I appreciated the creative techniques Hitchcock was implying in certain scenes, but I just couldn't force myself to care about anything. Then the surprise element is introduced and I thought the film was wrapping up soon...wrong. It goes on for an entirely different third act, which in reality, reflects Hitchcock's own persona. Roger Ebert expertly points out how Ferguson is actually Hitchcock with his controlling obsessiveness over his blonde actors. This is glaringly obvious and serves as another layer to this already rich film. Vertigo is something I need to revisit in the near future. Maybe the second time around I can see the brilliance and throw it higher on my list, as of right now Rear Window still stands near the top.",7,0,1,4 May 2016
Black Swan," Aronofsky has another polarizing film under his belt.
","Aronofsky is a visceral director, most of his films are polarizing, Black Swan is no exception. Here, he takes the beautiful and artistic art of being a ballerina, which seems so innocent, and turns it into a sick and twisted mind melt of a film. Black Swan grabs you, shakes you and leaves you wanting more. The film is far from perfect, but it shows that Aronofsky is certainly a master of his craft. After winning the role of the lead in a production of Swan Lake, Nina becomes obsessed with trying to be perfect for a demanding instructor, her overbearing mother and even herself. Her world is thrown upside down when she thinks that the new girl is vying for her spot, yet not everything is black and white. Portman plays Nina, a girl who was thrust into his life by her mother, who gave it up to raise her. Her constant obsession with being perfect leads to her ultimate undoing. She tries so hard to please her mother, her instructor and herself that she starts to loose her mind. Her life begins to mirror the story in the production. I say the word mirror because Aronofsky uses this object in almost every scene he can. He shows the duality of the character, she plays both the white swan and the black swan. The creativity of the mirrors is quite something, I don't know if it's true, but it feels like there is a mirror in every scene of the film. As if it's another character, Nina's self reflection trying to break into this life. Mila Kunis is the new girl who is both beautiful and talented. So of course she becomes Portman's alternate. Her eyes are hypnotic and she plays the role of the bad girl with an attitude. The polar opposite to the uptight and proper Portman. Yet the obsession and paranoia eats away at Portman enough to lead her to some dark places. Nina becomes so entranced with the story and her performance that she can no longer tell the difference between her hallucinations and reality, even when she plucks a feather from her back and stares at it with her beady red eyes. That's a haunting image. Nina's obsession mirror's Aronofsky's own obsession to the art and the process of filmmaking. Every shot, every colour, every beat is mapped out in his mind and I believe he captured every moment on film. The cinematography in the film is fluid and beautiful, yet visceral when needed to be. There are moments that will get under your skin. I can watch a person being mutilated to no end in Saw, yet the little things that happen in Black Swan are enough to make you cringe. Remember, it's the little things that count. I praise Aronofsky for taking a different approach to each film. The run and gun style of the Wrestler is far from the picturesque beauty of The Fountain. Black Swan lands somewhere in the middle. The film begins and ends with a beautiful dance number. The last performance in the film is quite beautiful to be honest. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, she was possessed and I loved it.Portman shines in a role that should earn her an Oscar nomination and the film manages to be one of the best of the year. The supporting cast was marvelous, Vincent Cassel is seductive and menacing. Mila Kunis, as stated before is a great counter weight to Portman and Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother feels like icing on the cake. Her relationship to her daughter rivals Carrie at times. I was engrossed with Nina and her deterioration from start to finish. When she told the story of Swan Lake to this guy in a bar, I knew how the film would end. The film takes some time to get to where it wants to go, so the pace is one concern I have with it, yet there is enough of a pay off in the end. Black Swan is a film that stays with you, whether you enjoyed it or not. Aronofsky doesn't apologize for his films, he makes them the way he wants to and I applaud him for it.",8,2,7,21 December 2010
Changeling," A Film That Could Have Been A Masterpiece...
","Christine Collins is called in to work on her day off. She leaves her son at home and promises to take him out tomorrow to make it up to him. When she returns, he is missing, nowhere to be found. 5 months later the LAPD claim to have found him, but when they present the boy to Christine, she refuses him, saying he is not her son. Instead of making the department look embarrassed and admit failure, they throw her in a mental institution.What makes Changeling even more depressing is that this is all based on true events.Eastwood has yet another winner under his belt with Changeling. Some might find it a hard film to enjoy, but I was engaged throughout, due to the performances, art direction, story and Eastwood's talented directing. It's Eastwood's eye to detail that brings this 1920's era to life. I was really impressed with the design of this film and it felt completely real to me. From the set design to the costume design. Normally you can see through the fabric and know that it was made for the film, but here it simply fits.A lot of the film rests on the shoulders of Angelina Jolie, as the mother of the lost child. I believed her in this role. Her eyes do most of the acting, subtle and honest. Yet at times her overbearing yelling distracts. At first it's believable, but near the end it seems more of the same and irritating at times. It's a strong enough performances to garner attention from Award ceremonies. On the supporting side is John Malkovich, who kicks all kinds of ass without doing much. His presence is enough to make you cheer. He is in command and you can tell by simply listening to his tone of voice. Colm Feore is someone you can count on to play any man with questionable morals. It's all in his face, perfectly cast here as the Chief of police. I have to say that a weak link in the acting is Jeffrey Donovan. I enjoyed him to a degree, but his voice/accent is just too annoying to get use to. I squirmed in my seat a couple of times, not from his characters actions, but from the accent.One person to watch for here is Jason Butler Harner, who plays a serial killer. He takes a slightly different approach to the subject matter. He isn't too crazy, he isn't too weird, he's a mix of both. But what makes it a more horrifying performance is that he is human. We are not seeing Hannibal Lector up on the screen, we are seeing a human being. I wouldn't be surprised if a Supporting Acting nod went in his direction. Also, Amy Ryan makes a small appearance, nothing too big, but her scenes are well enough to make a mention of.The story is strong, and it is strengthened by the fact that it is based on a true story. If it were fabricated, then the emotion might not have been there, at least not as much as what this film delivers. Jolie delivers a performance that is heart wrenching, at times, and it is heightened by that small little fact that someone in this world went through those emotions, those barriers and heartaches.Yes, this film is depressing. Eastwood knows it, and uses it to his advantage. Throughout the entire film I found myself just wanting to punch some people in the face, to yell at them and help Jolie in her cause to get her son back. Malkovich does this for the audience, which is why I think his character kicks ass. He does what we as the audience want to do. The tension in this film is high, not from thrills, but from the horrible things that these characters do to Jolie. She stands her ground, we cheer, and they throw more rocks at her, we tense up. Great flow for this film.Although, with all it's greatness, it does have a weakness. It's too freaking long. I thought the film was going to end, then it went on for another 20 minutes. I think with a bit more editing and tightening up, you can easily shave off those 20 minutes. Even though I was entertained and engaged in the last little bit of the film, mostly the trial and the bits in between the trial, I couldn't help but think that the film should wrap up soon. Real soon.Much like Eastwood's Oscar baby, Mystic River, Changeling deals with a missing child. Only this time it's the feminine aspect and the time period is drastically different. The film is strong enough to stand as one of his better works and if it were a bit tighter and shorter...I might have been able to call it a masterpiece.Too bad.",8,5,9,8 November 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'Borat Is Much Funnier then Ali G.'
","Borat is a Kazakhstani television personality who heads to USA, the so called 'greastest country in the world'. In an attempt to learn more about the country to bring to Kazakhstan, Borat manages to upset almost every single person he encounters. While in America he develops an unhealthy obsession with Pamela Anderson and begins a quest to become her husband.I have to say this right off the bat, I hate Ali G with a passion. That character is not funny one bit and every time I hear his voice I feel like punching a baby in the face. Now, Borat is another story. I've seen some of his skits on television and guess what...no punching of babies. In fact I smiled every once and while I yes a chuckle did happen. Once I saw the trailer for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, again a smirk or two and a chuckle. Then all these reviews came pouring in: Funniest Comedy of the year, A fearless comedy, Riotously funny, and so on. So does BORAT make it as one of the funniest films of all time? Is it full of side-splitting laughter? Or is it just over-hyped?Much like Snakes on a Plane, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, has you laughing at the title alone. Without even seeing the film you knew it would be funny and it is, although I do have to say that hype killed it. It is nowhere near the funniest film of all time. Of the last five years maybe? Well, I would put it high on the list, but I still find The 40 Year Old Virgin to be funnier, maybe because it was a smarter comedy.The one problem with Borat is that while it claims all be set in 'reality' it's quite obvious that some scenes are staged, the best example would be the final ten minutes of the film, with Pamela Anderson. While it is indeed funny, it takes away from the rest of the film because it immediately takes you out of it's reality. Yes, it is a film with a story to tell, even if that story is buried deep under it's randomness, but the feel of the film goes all over the place.It's offensive, but in this day and age almost everything is. At no point did I think anything in the film was over-the-line or in bad taste. The film is on the heels of Jackass II for being crude. It's one more step towards what is excepted in the eyes of the movie going public. Both films contain male nudity, and in both cases they get laughs. In Borat, the nude wrestling match had me on the floor. It was definitely the highlight. Whether or not THAT particular scene was staged is debatable, if it were, you might ask yourself is it still as funny.I found myself laughing off and on with Borat, more times it was a chuckle that a gut buster. Cohen does a good job at staying in character throughout the entire film, which is a short one by the way and ends faster then you can say the whole title. It does make for an entertaining watch, just don't go in thinking that it is the funniest thing ever cause you will be disappointed.",7,2,4,21 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredibly Average Hulk
","After testing an upcoming project on himself, Dr. Bruce Banner becomes a giant green monster, known as The Hulk. The father of his girlfriend is a general who wants to capture the creature and create an army of these monsters.After The Hulk disappointed fans in 2003 because there wasn't even 'Hulk Smash', the people in suits decided to give it another go, this time less talk and more walk. This time there were changes all around. New director, new leads and a new HULK all together. This time we have a more gritty and mean hulk, yet at the same time it has that campy feel that throws back to the old TV show. While the new version is better then what Lee gave us a few years back, it still isn't an eye popper.Out is Bana and in is Norton. A stronger actor, yet he is in unfamiliar territory. Norton is not really a blockbuster star, which begged the question 'Are they really going to make a blockbuster Hulk, or another artistic piece'. Norton brings more depth to the character, yet with the ongoing drama that plagued the film it is hard to tell what more he wanted to do with the character. William Hurt replaces Sam Elliott as the General, he chews the scenery he's in and plays up the comic book bad guy role very well. Finally Liv Tyler steps in for Jennifer Connelly, much like the last film that character isn't given too much to do except cry for Banner. Tim Roth makes his way into this film playing a bad guy yet again. He isn't given much to do here either and the reason behind him becoming what he becomes is a bit eye rolling.Another problem the first film had was that the Hulk itself was too fake looking. This time they tried to ground this beast in reality a bit more, yet it still feels out of place. He is less green and a tad bigger I believe. While I still am not a big fan of this character he works better here. The Hulk finally sees his match here with the villain and no he does not battle with rabid overgrown dogs. The fight between these two beasts is action packed as they tear up the city (half of which was filmed in my hometown).As decent as this film is it doesn't leave a lasting memory. It's a loud and fast paced action film, which is exactly what it should be. It will please those who might have wanted more from the first one, which took itself way too seriously. There's fun to be had here, watching a giant Hulk destroy army vehicles will please action junkies. But we are now on a high lever for comic book films. No longer can you just make a decent comic book film, you need to wow the audience and leave a lasting impression. The Incredible Hulk doesn't do this. You walk in, enjoy the two hours and then leave and don't really talk about it anymore.",6,3,6,3 July 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Abrams Goes Heavy On The Action And Lite On The Spy.
","Ethan Hunt has finally settled down with his soon to be married girlfriend. When he is told that his former trainee is in trouble he decides to go on a rescue mission to help save her. Unfortunately she dies during the rescue and Hunt is on the 'hunt' for the man responsible for her death, which leads him into a tangled web of deceit and a dangerous weapon known as the RABBITS FOOT.J.J. Abrams is the creative mind behind such hits as Alias and Lost. Both of which have a massive cult following. Now Abrams takes his stab at the big screen with the third installment in the spy franchise Mission:Impossible. Abrams take on the franchise is leaps and bounds over what Woo offered, but falls short of De Palma's original. Abrams goes heavy on the action and lite on the spy. Some may think that Woo destroyed the series, I don't think this is true, but nevertheless, Abrams is trying to revive it by kicking it into overdrive. While watching MI:III, I kept asking myself, is this suppose to be a spy flick? Every single movie in this series differs from the other, even if Abrams does take notes from both. Mission Impossible is a good way to start the summer blockbuster movies, but one would of expecting a little bit more from it's hype.First of all, it does have a lot of action. This is a perfect example for edge of your seat entertainment. The action never lets up, and it's actually enjoyable to watch. The bridge scene was impressive, but you can tell right away that the entire scene plays like an episode out of Alias. For some reason Abrams always must have the transportation vehicle get attacked for the person inside of it. Can we get another way of getting this person Abrams?Cruise manages to keep his cool in this movie, I was surprised that he didn't start killing people in the name of Scientology. With the help of the supporting actors, the cast makes MI:III somewhat believable, but what's with the lack of Hoffman? Abrams, you have a good actor in your back pocket, he gives you a great performance, as usual in Hoffman's case, but you use him for 15 to 20 minutes. The film also under uses Fishburn and Pegg, who is the comedic relief. What's the Rabbits foot? We're never told, or seem to care either. PLot twists, yes, but why? The film would have made more sense if it just stuck with it's basic course, does every film need to throw in a twist to shock the viewer? A bomb inserted in the head? Even if it was written before Alias, we see used in Alias before, so we basically know what's going to happen.Abrams does showcase some talent, and he can only improve. With more concentration on his characters then he can surly become one of the heavy hitters in Hollywood. Abrams has a keen eye for action and pulls out all the stops here. MI:III is a good start for action movies, it sets the bar for others to follow. If you're able to leave your brain at the door and sit through some bad dialogue, such as Humpty Dumpty Sat On A Wall...then enjoy a great action movie.",7,0,0,18 May 2006
Sucker Punch," What's the purpose?
","A young girl is institutionalized by her abusive stepfather, after she accidentally kill her little sister. Not able to cope with reality, she retreats to an alternate reality where she comes up with a plan to escape. That's putting it lightly.If you want a more literal translation, for some reason she chooses to escape to a whore house fantasy, where she dances for people. When she dances for people she escapes yet again, to a more stylized and action oriented fantasy. I think Snyder needed an excuse to show his creative imagery and instead of trying to craft a reasonable story, he throws together some kind of conglomerate mess of proportions. Here is a guy who has had success in adapting other works of art. Whether it's a remake (Dawn of the Dead) or a graphic novel (300, Watchman) Snyder's only real task was being able to translate something already written and visualized, to the big screen. This was his first attempt at something original. He fails. As a visual spectacle, it's great. No denying that. But I recall a film by the name of Avatar being blasted for it's unoriginal story and the fact that it relied too heavily on visuals. Sucker Punch, while being original, lacks any sense of purpose in its story. Why do we care for these characters? The answer is we don't. Baby Doll has little to no dialogue, Rocket would make a better lead character to get behind. I felt more emotion for the baby dragon that is slain than any of the female characters that parade around in little to no clothing. A 14 year old boys wet dream. That's how Sucker Punch comes off as, something Snyder thought up of when he was a kid. The film is for people with ADD, because Snyder hopes you forget the first 20 minutes of the film as he tries to surprise you with the ending, bringing it back to the beginning again. Why do we care for something that doesn't happen. Everything we see is her fantasy. When the ending is revealed as to what truly happen, we never get to see that reality. Snyder needs to mature as a filmmaker and stop treading around in these waters. They seem to give up on their quest for objects half way through as well. They need a map in their first mission, they get it. Fire in the second, the succeed. A knife in their third and all of a sudden they are trying to steal a bomb? I'm sure there is an explanation for this somewhere, but it's missing in the film. Watching Inception beforehand will give people a better understand of a level within a level scenario that is attempted here. Inception is the better film and it pulls it off way more effectively, despite having more confusing elements, it comes off clearer than Sucker Punch. A good soundtrack and entertaining visuals aren't enough for me to recommend this film. I'm sure the target audience will love it. Young boys who no attention span. It tries to cram every fantasy element into one: Dungeons and Dragons, Futuristic Science Fiction, Alternate History. The film has Nazis that look like Helghast from Killzone, dragons, robots, giant rock samurai that bleeds light. So many cool elements that are jammed together into a mess of a story line. Give me a reason to care for these 'fantasy' sequences and this film could have rocked my socks. Unfortunately I sat there wondering why I should even care, instead of enjoying myself. That's where the problem lies. You'll be wondering why should I care?",5,1,6,26 June 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," An Hour & A Half Of Filler, Followed By Twenty Minutes Of Awesome.
","Victoria is dead, there is no longer any threat to Bella. So she and Edward get married, while on their honeymoon they do the dirty deed and oops, Bella gets pregnant. Vampire pregnant, which means the fetus is growing at 5 times the normal rate and is killing her from within. The wolf clan cannot have this, as it breaks their treaty somehow and they come to kill the baby. Now Jacob must team up with the people he hates, the Cullens, in order to protect Bella. While this premise does sound interesting, it's a shame that the producers wanted to milk this poorly conceived franchise for every penny they can get. Instead of making one film, they split the story into two and Breaking Dawn Part 1 clearly suffers from over stuffing and filler. Nothing happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. We know they get married, we know they have sex and we know she gets pregnant. It takes way too long to get these plot points across. The wedding, the honeymoon and the pregnancy could have all happened in the first 30 minutes, but it's instead stretched to an obscene length. Books have more room to breath. The world is created an the writer has hundreds of pages to tell their story. Films don't have this luxury, so when a film comes out based on a book, you need to chop out the stuff that's simply not needed or wouldn't translate well to the screen. Since the people behind this film want to make more money, they split the last film into two. WB did the same for Harry Potter, but I can forgive them because there is actual story to tell in that film, here there is nothing. She doesn't get pregnant until 50 minutes into the film. Which means we are stuck with boring characters either being jealous of what others have (Jacob) or two people having sex over and over (Edward/Bella). The amount of time that was dedicated to the honeymoon is insane. What should have been a ten minute sequence, at most, takes about 30 minutes of screen time. Once Bella starts dying, the film tries to get into motion, but it's too late. When she goes into labor, that's when something finally interesting happens and the rest of the film makes for some of the most thrilling moments in the entire series. A standoff between the Cullens and the wolves is finally shown here, something that people have been waiting for since the first film. The tension between the two families finally explodes. This is exciting stuff, this is what people have been waiting for, but the film still suffers from bad CGI work when humans interact with the wolves. So the fight sequences, as exciting as they are, never really reach their full potential. The final frame of the film is so obvious half way through that I actually chuckled to myself when it happened. I still can't shake the feeling that the conflict of the whole series finished with Eclipse and what we have left is an overstretched denouement. Am I excited for the next film? Not really. Half the job of Part 1 is to get you excited for the next, this film fails horribly at that. What's left to happen? An after the credits sequences is shown where we are given a glimpse of what to expect, but I'm too far drawn away from the conflict by that point. Breaking Dawn is not the worst in the series, but clearly not the best. Had the film been one piece instead of two, then it would have been exciting. The simple fact that it drags on for so long is proof that splitting the film in two was a mistake, creatively. Financially, it's smart. Because young teenage girls will flock to anything, case in point -- this entire series.",4,11,13,29 March 2012
10 Cloverfield Lane," 'Crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come.'
","The trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane dropped on everyone, 2 months before the film's release. No one knew about it. Everyone went nuts over how this film could have been made, in this day of the internet, and no one know about it? The answer to that is because this film is in no way connected to the original Cloverfield film. Sorry to burst the bubble for those hoping for some kind of sequel, but this film is NOT IT. Michelle wakes up, chained to a wall, in an underground bunker. Her captor, a man named Howard, informs her that she was just in a car accident and that the world is under some kind of attack. She doesn't believe him and desperately tries to get out...but is the unknown on the outside more safe than what she knows lies within?The filmmakers have repeatedly stated that this film is not a sequel, nor does it take place in the same universe as the original. So what the hell is it exactly? There seems to be a bit of controversy over how the film came to be. One person says one thing, another says something else. Then you watch the film and you question both answers. Did the studio think they had a really well crafted film on their hands and wanted more people to see it? So they decided to throw the name Cloverfield onto it in the hopes of getting butts in the seats? What we DO know is that the original script, The Cellar, had nothing to do with Cloverfield. It was later crafted to be somewhat similar. Or maybe it wasn't. According to some interviews, they didn't really change anything. After watching the film, some people may find that hard to believe. So how am I suppose to feel about this film? I'm struggling with that entire dilemma. Whether the last ten minutes or so of the film was tagged on for the Cloverfield vibe, or if it was always there, it does not really belong in this film. It doesn't flow with everything that came before it. Goodman played Howard, a conspiracy theorist who decided to build a bunker for when the world went to the dumps. In his mind, true or not, the world is going to the dumps. He just happened to save a young woman along the way. Goodman's Howard is kind, dangerous, sensitive, crazy, smart and destructive. The man is prepared for anything and everything, but is he right? That's the question that Michelle, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, needs answered and so does the audience. The film has a lot of fun going back and forth with the answer to this. You'll jump back and forth questioning him and his motives and the film is paced perfectly in peeling back the layers of the mystery surrounding the plot. Winstead is refreshing with her take on Michelle. She's not helpless, despite her situation, she's resourceful. She's not some emotionless bad-ass either, she has many moments of uncertainty and fear. John Gallagher, Jr. plays Emmet, another man inside the bunker. He's there on his own free will, he injured himself trying to get in. This further cements Howard's claims about the outside world. Emmet isn't the smartest person, but Gallagher plays him in an innocent way that makes him instantly likable. Although, it is John Goodman who delivers a stellar performance, maybe the best of his career. His unhinged Howard will make you trust him and fear him within seconds. I can now say that I am officially scared of John Goodman. 90% of this film is off the wall intense. Everything within the bunker is an excellent film. Everything outside the bunker is bunk. I won't spoil anything that happens on the outside, but I honestly believe that it belongs in another film. Regardless of whatever half assed set up they try to pigeonhole in the dialogue. I believe this ending will split the audience, but I simply cannot talk about it any further without divulging information that in all honesty, needs to be kept secret. 10 Cloverfield Lane is at times unsettling and nerve-racking. I looked over to my wife at one moment and she looked terrified. The intense sequences are enough to make you grip your arm chair tight and in a perfect world, John Goodman would be nominated for an award. Sadly, we don't live in a perfect world and that will never happen. So please, see this film and judge it on its own merit. Do not expect or compare it to Cloverfield, you'll be disappointed and expect more anthology type Cloverfield films in the future.",8,1,4,6 April 2016
The Expendables 2," Exactly what I wanted from the first film - The Avengers of action movies.
","While on a mission one of the 'Expendables' gets himself killed, this leads the crew to go on a mission of revenge. But is it too much to handle? I was severely disappointed in the first Expendable film, the mediocre action, the use of CGI blood and the unimpressive villain ruined the experience. So I was hoping that the second time around they would correct these issues. I can safely say, they did and they did it in spades. The big change is Stallone is no longer behind the camera, so he is more focused on his role of Barney and his mind isn't split between two separate places. The biggest change though is the tone, The Expendables 2 does not take itself seriously at all and neither did I, so I had a blast watching what is ultimately a parody of the action genre. I can look past the acting, lack of story and plot because the film doesn't try to give you one. It's a simple film with a simple purpose. Get as many of these big guys into one film, make it a guys flick with lots of action and killing and they succeeded. The biggest misstep this film has is the motivation behind the revenge. The wrong person dies. A character is killed off that we have almost zero emotional connection with, it would have made more sense if it were another character that disappears early on in the film. It seems this character's sole purpose was to have these characters get their revenge on, which makes it less engaging for the viewer.I was surprised at how underwhelmed I was by the action in the first film, here it is more stylized and fun. The film steps on the gas from the very beginning and almost never lets up. We are thrown into this action sequence at the start, which is better than anything the original had to offer. A more competent action director is behind the lens this time, Simon West who gave us Con Air and the more recent Mechanic. He understands what is needed and delivers some wild action sequences. As I mentioned before, the film does not take itself seriously and it has a very tongue and cheek demeanour about it. It's not afraid to wink at the camera, specifically when Chuck Norris enters the screen and steals the show with the funniest line in the entire film. The film is full of one liners you would expect from an action film. During a fight, one characters exclaims, 'Let's wrap this up' he then proceeds to take a chain and wrap it around another character's neck to choke him out. Another scene we have a bad guy get shot a dozen times by everyone and Stallone retorts, 'Rest in pieces'. Finally, my favourite, Stallone says 'heads up' then proceeds to throw a head to some people. Yes, this movie is violent, so no fear about the PG-13 rating.So what about the guys? Well, they all come back, some have a lot more to do than others. Lundgren is basically the comedic relief. Crews and Courture again get short shifted and feel like background characters. Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris all have more in depth cameos and finally Van Damme shines as the villain. Van Damme really deserved more screen time. We are introduced to him, then we cut back every so often as he tries to steal his plutonium, then we have him fight at the end. He deserved more screen time, so did his right hand man, Scott Adkins. Both are more martial arts type fighters than big gun shooters and since this is a Stallone film, this is a big gun shooting movie. They get their fight sequences, but both of them I thought could have been a bit longer. Especially the Van Damme/Stallone fight.So in the end, The Expendables did exactly what the first film should have done. It's a hilarious parody of the action genre and has non-stop excitement from start to finish. This is finally the film from these guys that I've been waiting for.",8,237,339,13 August 2012
The Longest Yard," About As Bad A Mr. Deeds
","Crewe was a football superstar back in the day, but cast a black eye on the sport when he sold out his team-mates. Then a drunk driving accident sends him to prison, but the thing is the Warden specifically requested he be sent to his prison. Now Crewe has been giving the duty of putting together a football team, full of the inmates. Recruiting is hard, until the inmates find out that they are playing the guards.Let me just say that I've never seen the original, so my views on this film are not in comparison to it, but as a film on it's own. I'm sitting here asking myself if I should judge this film against other football films, or even other Adam Sandler films. I can't really do that with the latter because it's not like any other Sandler film. It seems that he has grown up out of the stupid jokes that involve him yelling a lot and hitting little kids. This seems to be a softer side, a side that wants to show that he is not just a comedian, but a money making star. If this is a side of Sandler that we will be seeing, then I want to shun him out of the business right now.I've never seen 'Punch Drunk Love' or 'Spanglish', so I can't comment on those films, but other then the recent 'Click', Sandler hasn't had a good, or even funny, film since The Waterboy. The Longest Yard, if I were to describe it in two words it would be, NOT FUNNY. Now I know it's not suppose to be a flat out comedy, but with comedic actors like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler, you would expect to maybe laugh every once and a while, this is not the case. Mr. Deeds was Sandler's worst film in his career (not including that boat one) and The Longest Yard seems to be giving it a run for it's money. I had a more enjoyable time watching Little Nicky then I did this.The film is full of clich√©s. I was rolling my eyes when the mean prison guard gave Sandler the 'you're okay' speech at the end, not to mention the useless and meaningless character of Chris Rock, who is only there for sympathy, only there to get a few tears, but it doesn't even work. It's sad really. Let me tell you this, just because there are stars in the remake that were in the original, does not make it 'okay' or 'good'. Does having them in the movie signify some kind of blessing? Give me a break. I can see having wrestlers in the film to play football players and guardss, but they didn't add anything to it. No star value of 'Hey, look who it is' because there are so many of them. Also, Nelly makes an appearance, yet another rapper trying to make it in Hollywood. Again, I'm asking myself, what's the purpose? Couldn't get real actors? So you try to reach out to the young crowd, 'Hey look, it's NELLY kids.'Now after telling you that the film is full of stupid clich√©s, that it's not funny and that it tries to pass of rappers and wrestlers as actors, what else is there to tell? How about how it's not even a good football movie? Not once did I ever think that they would lose and not once did I ever think that any of this would ever actually happen. Never would the inmates be wondering around the prison at night. Basically you need to pass on this film, all it consists of is poor McDonald's jokes that never hit the mark. Go watch the original instead¬Öand I haven't even seen it.",4,11,20,12 December 2006
The Hangover," Funniest Film Of The Year.
","After a wild bachelor party, 3 friends wake up in a destroyed room and discover that their friend, the groom, is missing. Now they must re-trace their steps from the night that they can't remember in order to get him back to the wedding the next day.This premise is just an excuse for some wild and random comedic scenarios, such as having a tiger be in your bathroom when you wake up. The joy of watching this film is seeing just how many crazy things come next, all of which the characters have no memory of. What makes The Hangover work so well, is not just those random comedic scenarios, but the cast that blended so well together. Specifically Zach Galifianakis, whom has been the audience favourite.As the film progresses, the characters find themselves getting into some serious situations due to their antics the night before. I want say what happens, as each one if funny and should be watched with surprise. It easy to say that this film will not bore you. It does have a particular comedic style though and you can judge yourself if you'll be into it or not from the trailer. Todd Phillips, of Oldschool fame, has his funniest movie here. Both Road Trip and Oldschool were good, yet were missing something that made me really love it. The Hangover has this something. It's not a teen comedy (road trip) nor is it a star powered film (old school). It uses familiar faces that make you go 'I've seen him before' but never do these actors overshadow the film. Had it of been a bigger name cast it wouldn't have worked so well.The three friends are played by Ed Helms, the uptight dentist, Bradley Cooper, the suave smooth talker, and Zach Galifianakis, the odd brother in law. The groom is played by Justin Bartha, the National Treasure sidekick. It's easy to say the Galifianakis steals the show. It's obvious he will garner more roles from this, I just hope he doesn't get pigeon-holed into this style. He reminds me of Chi McBride and I want him to branch out before it's too late (Michael Cera). Helms and Cooper also hold up nicely, I'm familiar with Helms from The Office and Daily Show fame and Cooper from previous films has always been likable. Bartha isn't in the film that much, since most of it is them looking for the guy.The Hangover also doesn't suffer from the one thing that seems to kill so many comedies. Over exposed trailer. Yes we've all seen the Mike Tyson bit, but the film has so many random bits of comedy that you will enjoy yourself throughout the running time. If the film does fault, it's with the character of Mr. Chow. I like Ken Jeong, but here he plays the character way over the top and it becomes distracting. Heather Graham makes an appearance as well and as she does with almost every role she takes on, you see her boobies. Well, one boob.The film is funny, I was entertained, and I expect to see good things from Galifianakis. It's vulgar and obscene and don't expect to see much heart near the end or a good message, like Apatow films do. While it does have that one scene in which one character stands up for himself, it doesn't try to throw any real messages out the audience.Make sure you stay for the first bit of the credits, as the laughs don't stop.",8,3,7,11 June 2009
United 93," 'A Film That Is Honest And From The Heart'
","United 93 tells the events of September 11th, 2001. It was the only hijacked plane that did not make it's final destination because of it's passengers who decided to take control of the plane. I sat and watch United 93 and Stone's 'World Trade Center' in the same session. While both films did tug at the emotional scales, United 93 seemed to be a more heartfelt film.Greengrass, who's other films include the just as serious 'Bloody Sunday' and spy flick 'Bourne Surpremacy', takes on the difficult task of retelling the horrific events of that day. With no mainstream actors, a relatively small budget and the controversial topic, it would seem that the film was doomed a failure before it was even finished. Alas, it got the approval from the families and people who said that it was 'too soon' actually went to see it. There are many words one may use to describe the film: respectful, powerful, humanistic, but you can't really describe it to anyone, they must see it for themselves.Why does the film work so well? It chooses to show us the story and not shove it down our throats. We know what happened, but not how it happened. We will never know how it happened, but United 93 gives us a suggestion. Greengrass chose to use a relatively unknown cast and it works. There are no big name distractions here, these people are not being paid big bucks to star in films, which is the sense I got in 'World Trade Center'. Although, you might recognize a face or two, at one moment I was saying to myself, 'Hey, it's that guy from The Mummy'. There were only a few moments in the film where the acting was pretty bad, mainly in the military scenes. That one blonde woman was horrible, but this did not ruin the film.It was interesting to see the intensity of the military personal and flight control centers doing what they do. I can only imagine it was ten times more intense that day then what was depicted. You get the sense of urgency in these scenes, a sense of realism. Everything was pulled off nicely. Seeing the mentions of the other planes was a good way to broaden the drama. I was pleased the film wasn't solely concentrating on United 93, which was another problem for Stone's piece. I was surprised to see actual footage of the planes hitting the towers to be shown and applaud Greengrass for not shying away from it. The use of inexpensive hand-held cameras at to the urgency and realism that was needed. If the production was any bigger, it would have ruined the effectiveness.The film doesn't show us the heroes from that day, instead it shows us how human they are. In the final chilling moments of the film when the passengers are trying to take over the plane, there is no 'hero' shot of one man overcoming evil. Instead it is raw anger from these passengers and their need to save their own lives and the lives of others. The film ends on a perfect and chilling note of what they saw. We are not watching them crash, we are there with them. The heart pounding score increasing the tension and the intensity of the actions. There are no post-dramatic events to show, no air traffic control scenes trying to explain what happened. A beautiful ending to a powerful film.Here's a film that tells us to look back at that day and remember those who died. It's not one to shy away from a serious topic, instead it confronts it head on. The film was given the go ahead by the families from the passengers on board. No one should watch United 93 as a 'film', but more of a look back on that day. It's a respect piece to those who died. Not a tale of survival of any kind, other then the fact that we as people survived that evil and continue to live on. It's safe to say that United 93 is one of the most important films of 2006 and probably of the last 5 or so years. Not only does it honour the family members of those on the plane, but the rest of the people who experience something that day; everyone experience something that day. There is no character to identify with, they are all equal, all human, all just like us. Everything that happens is in the moment, no one knows what is going on, but audience. Everyone should give this film an honest open minded viewing. It is important and will only grow to be more important with time.",8,6,11,3 January 2007
Deja Vu," Time Travel = Automatic Plot Hole
","Yet another pairing of Washington and Scott, this time they are tackling time travel. As it is with every time travel film there are plot holes, but it's always neat to see how the writers tackle such a heated topic and Deja Vu tries to attach an action thriller into the mix.Tony Scott has a certain style to him now, anyone whose seen Man On Fire or Domino knows this, here it isn't as blatant, but it's till there. I enjoy his films, they never try to inspire or be more then what it sets out to do.There are some interesting scenes here, like trying to drive in the present while using a device to see the past and follow the killer. Did you understand that? The supporting cast, including my man Kilmer, basically sit around and 'teach' Washington about time travel. Washington is the only one who really gets to have fun and do stuff.As a time travel film, it's okay, as an action thriller, it's alright. The film never truly steps outside of that mediocre box, considering it has so many things going for it, one might expect a bit more from those involved. The characters are somewhat likable, and....creepy? Watching her shower in the past...yup.This is not a film to rush out and see, unless your a big time fan of Washington or Scott. Instead give it a watch when you click past it on TV.",7,2,3,20 July 2009
It," Killer clowns are scary, right?
","Stephen King terrified people with IT, his second longest novel next to The Stand. Bringing kids fears to life with the embodiment of Pennywise the dancing clown. In 1990, the 'epic' story was turned into a two part TV-Mini series starring Tim Curry and John Ritter. As a kid, that film was terrifying due to the performance of the friendly clown with a sinister undertone. Looking back now, it's incredibly cheesy and 'of the time'. So an update was needed and Stephen King has had a huge year; with The Dark Tower, Netflix's Gerald's Game and a new TV series The Mist, he's back in the spotlight. In the town of Derry, Maine, kids go missing. So much that the rate is six times the national average. One of those kids is Georgie, a little boy who disappeared down the sewers. His brother Bill, has never stopped looking for him. Along with his friends, he plans to search the sewers, hoping to find at least a body. Along with his friends, known as The Losers Club, they make it their mission this summer...but when they find out the answers lead to a child killing clown, their nightmares become a reality.IT was going to be a big success, but no one anticipated how big a success. After a massive weekend at the box-office, people are looking to be scared again, in R-rated territory no less. The road to the finish line was a long one for the film, with Cary Fukunaga wanting to write and direct. Those plans fell through and his reasons were that the studio wanted to make a generic 'jump scare' film, where he wanted to tell a deeper story about the kids. The finished film, courtesy of Mama director Muschietti manages to balance those two aspects quite well. The decision to split the film in two and use the first half to focus on the kids only was an interesting move and one that let the story breathe a little bit more. We're already being pulled in plenty of directions with the numerous characters, to have to be pulled into their adult version too would be too much. The story has been 'updated' and takes place in the 80's. Hot off the heels of Strangers Things, IT plays into some nostalgia here and it works.The kids look and act the parts very well and all have great chemistry. I was particularly impressed with Sophia Lillis who plays Beverly. She looks like a young Amy Adams and has enough charisma to have a career in the industry. With just enough sass, but obvious fear lurking under the surface, she has the most to engage with. Her nightmare sequence in the bathroom might be a tad bit of overkill and doesn't feel as sinister as the 1990's TV version. Something about the father touching the blood on the sink irks me more from the TV version than him simply not noticing the room completely covered in it in this film. It also makes the 'clean-up' part a little bit less believable here. Bill, our defacto lead character, is tormented by the loss of his little brother, this is his defining characteristic. These two characters get the most attention while we just float around the rest of the kids stories. The one with the least amount of screen time has to be Mike, who is the outsider of the group. These kids made me laugh and made me believe in their friendship, which makes the film work and connect.Skarsg√•rd had the difficult task of following in Tim Curry's footsteps. He does a really good job with Pennywise though. His otherworldly eyes were not CGI, he managed to move them in different directions himself and his creepy voice added to the sinister feel the character needs. One look at him and some audience members gasped. There are plenty of jump scares and the audience fell for almost every single one. Surprisingly enough, I didn't. I'll fall for a good jump scare any day of the week, but IT failed to get even one out of me. I don't know why, maybe it was the obvious horror beats leading to each one but the film didn't 'get me'. It felt scary, but not once was I scared, if that makes sense. Maybe because the whole film takes place during the daytime it adds a sense of security? I don't know, but plenty of people in the theatre seemed frightened. Muschietti has a creative eye for the unnatural. Looking over Ben's shoulder in the library and seeing an old lady stare him down without him knowing is effective, as is the use of the stabilizing camera effects on Pennywise's face while everything else shakes wildly. Small camera movements, such as straightening a picture, are done creatively here and add to the immersive feel the film wants. Even though the film feels predictable in the horror beats, with each scare simply leading into more anticipation for the next one, the film as a whole works. IT does a great job of me wanting to see the next chapter.",8,4,11,11 September 2017
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," It's the story of a man, a woman, and a rabbit in a triangle of trouble.
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit mixes the world of animation and live action effortlessly, what makes it even more respectable is how well it holds up compared to recent flicks like Looney Tunes: Back in Action. Zemeckis pushes the envelope and continues to today, or at least tries to. His films seem to lack the heart and soul of his earlier works. With Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Zemeckis blends old school film noir detective stories with a looney stylized world in which the character live. Bob Hoskins is the alcoholic detective who must solve the case of....who framed roger rabbit. He does a wonderful job in the role and acts opposite an imaginary character with ease. Roger Rabbit himself is a zany character that is in love with Jessica Rabbit, a busty bombshell of a character with flowing red hair. She is of course the femme fatale. What's a film without a villain? Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom is creepy and effective. Without a doubt he will give chills to your bones. His distaste for toons is about as villainous as you can get. Their are numerous winks and nods to old school cartoon characters. What other film can you see Daffy and Donald duck battle each other? The toon world is a great way to show creativity and the crew make sure they use their opportunity to do so. This film is great for both kids and adults and is to this day, a classic.I highly recommend Who Framed Roger Rabbit to anyone looking for a good story, interesting characters and great entertainment. The film is not only funny, but a great mystery waiting to be unraveled. Check it out.",8,0,0,31 July 2010
John Wick," Please see this movie.
","John Wick is an interesting film that came and went before our eyes. Yet those who did decide to give it a chance, seem to love it very much. It's 'Certified Fresh' on Rottentomatoes and has a 7.5 rating on IMDb as of right now. Impressive for a film that is basically one shoot out after the next....after the next....after the next.An ex hit-man comes out of retirement after he's attacked by three thugs in his home. This attack leaves him beaten, without a car and a dead dog, which was given to him by his recently deceased wife. Big mistake. Once these guys tries to sell the muscle car to a garage that strips parts, the owner seems to instantly recognize it. The man asks, who's car this is. Who cares? The young spoiled brat replies. I can tell you one thing, we beat his ass to get it, and his stupid dog too. Bam, punched in the face. The kid goes crying to his mob boss of a father, who then calls up that mechanic. Did you punch my son in the face? Yes sir, I did. Why, he asked. Well sir, because he stole John Wick's car...and killed his dog. Oh crap.This sets up the film, the classic revenge tale. Nothing really new here. We've seen dozens of films where the retired killer has to come out of retirement to revenge the death of a loved one. This time it happens to be a canine. The dog is adorably cute and my wife was in tears...TEARS I TELL YOU, when they killed the poor pup. About one scene before it happened, she says to me, 'Are they going to kill the dog?' Terrified of the answer that I would not give her. Well, yes, they did. She instantly wanted John Wick to kill EVERYONE. So I guess when a dog gets it, you instantly want those responsible dead. Funny, I feel the same way. When people die on film, no big deal, but when an animal dies, all hell breaks lose. After that is out of the way, John Wick suits up to take out those who have wronged him. It just happens to be the son of his former boss. So when the boss finds out, he knows he's in trouble. So now he has to get to Wick before Wick gets to them. Thus, the body count piles up. It piles up in a finely tuned operatic fashion, as the action sequences are some of the best in the last few years. Wick uses his guns with precision. Shot to the chest, then to the head. It's robotic. One man against a dozen? Fair fight.To say the action in John Wick is stylized in an understatement. This is one of the best action films in years. Chad Stahelski, a stunt coordinator, makes his directing debut here. So he knows his way around a fight, being responsible for such films as the Expendables, The Wolverine, Tron: Legacy, and many many more. I like this new trend of giving people from different departments a chance at the directing chair. See what they can bring to the table. The man clearly knows his stuff, so give him a script to shoot and see what he can achieve. He nails it here. One impressive sequence has Wick going into a club, with multiple levels and rooms and takes out the bad guys one by one. First silently, then when all hell breaks lose, with calm and ease. Bottom line: This is one FUN film.Reeves never impresses with his acting ability. It's kind of a running gag with people that he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. One scene here has him actually showing some emotion, which is when he reads the letter from his wife after receiving the dog. The rest of the film is how bad ass can Reeves look while taking out dozens of people. The answer, really bad ass. Familiar faces show up, such as Willem Dafoe, as another assassin. Adrianne Palicki as a beautiful....well...assassin. Michael Nyqvist, from the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series, plays the Russian Mobster, whose son, Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy, gets him into this mess. As if we needed another reason to hate Theon. Finally Ian McShane as a friendly face in a crowd of so few. The world created in John Wick is interesting to me. These assassins have gold coins that get them into these places that only the secret society of assassins can access. There are hidden clubs, hotel rooms, etc. How can all these assassins and hit-men be in a club and not want to shoot each other. Well, there seem to be certain rules. Don't break them, or there might be consequences. Those club scenes are really fun. Jonathan Sela, the DOP, bathes the film is icy blues and nice neon lighting for those club scenes. Giving it a heightened look and feel. Everything about the film feels smooth as ice, just like John Wick. The directing style reflects the lead character. Aggressive when it needs to be, but calm and collected most of the time. When I say aggressive, boy do I mean aggressive. Wick acts like a man with nothing to lose, no fear. He will walk right into the lions den to get the job done. John Wick is one of the biggest surprises of 2014 for me. While some might call it a no brainer repetitive action film I call it high class action fun. FUN is the key word here. Watching John Wick dispose of those bodies was fun. Seeing this society of people who all know each other was fun. Seeing Keanu Reeves back in the limelight doing what he does best? You called it...fun.",8,9,21,17 January 2015
Lone Survivor," A Survivor's Tale
","Operation Red Wings is a botched attempt at trying to capture/kill the Taliban leader. After letting a group of goat herders go free, the four men on the mission find themselves between a rock and dozens upon dozens of Taliban. Lone Survivor right off the bat tells you one thing if you are not familiar with the story. Only one of these men survive. I'm putting my money on Marky Mark. Peter Berg, who helmed the disastrous Battleship, somewhat redeems himself here with a realistic take on a poorly planned Navy Seals operation. Berg uses restraint in some much needed areas, which builds tension. Little to know music, dead silence is used to escalate the fear and it works to great effect. Then he goes an kind of ruins it with some melodramatic music cues at other areas, but for the most part, this is an excellently directed film. I point to the sequence in which the characters literally throw themselves off a cliff in order to get away from the gunfire. The stunt coordination for them tumbling down the cliff side is some of the most brutal things put to film. How many times have you seem people jump off a cliff side and tumble down the side in a nice choreographed sequence that has them 'hurting' a bit once they hit the ground. These guys are thrown around, break bones, cut skin, bleed, cough blood and worse. Watching them being thrown like rag dolls heightens the realism that was needed in Lone Survivor. The film begins and ends with real footage of the men in the Navy Seals. Berg's nod to patriotism for the film. The dramatic parts are too concerned telling the story of these four fellas fight for survival to be bothered with the American flag waving propaganda. The film is small, intimate and personal. All four men give great performances. They all have genuine chemistry with each other, which is what is needed for you to root for their survival. You'd think because they're American and the enemy is the Taliban that it would be automatic, but you'd be surprised. Eric Bana has a small role, anyone could have honestly played that part. The film takes its time to build up to the action sequences, once it hits that note, it never lets up. These men are in the fight for their lives, a fight most of them lose.",8,1,9,14 January 2014
I'm Not There," ....Wake Me up When It Is Over
","The Life of bob Dylan, told through the performances of various different actors.A film is suppose to, among other things, entertain it's viewer on some level. It can be expertly made, well acted and thought-provoking, but if you cannot entertain your audience, what's the point of watching? If I'm not entertained, I lose interest and when I lose interest I get bored. You can have the most unique and complex ideas but if I can't get engaged by anything then again....what's the point. Enter I'm Not There. Well acted by everyone involved, a unique vision and script that is fresh, yet I was bored to tears. Flashes of 2001 come to me.Thinking of this film, many words come to my mind, pretentious is one of them. Thinking that it is more important then it actually is. I will give it credit for being unique and fresh, but that's it. Todd Haynes clearly had more on his plate then he could handle. Eliminate two of the 'Dylan' characters, it cuts the running time down, makes things more centred and complete. There, that is one simple solution that would have made the film better. It might have even been able to keep my attention. Who? Well, Richard Gere is the most obvious choice, his segment was the worst of the entire film.The cast all work well, and Haynes is decent at telling a story, but his ambition got the better of him here. Way too much for him to handle and for the audience. I get the fact that he wanted to tell the audience that bob Dyland can't be understood, but I'm sitting here thinking what was the point of me watching this film. What did I get from it? Nothing.I know there are fans of this film, my question is are they fans of Dylan? I'm a fan of Dylan and I did not like this movie, not for what is was trying to do, but for what it did, bored me to death.",6,4,5,14 February 2009
Unbreakable," Not As Good As People Think.
","Ever wonder what a super hero movie would be like if they lost all the real fancy powers and costumes? If it were real people living real ordinary lives with zero flash? Unbreakable asks this questions to the viewers.The film is incredibly well shot and shows patience. I really enjoyed Shyamalan using alternate ways to show basic conversations. Like at the beginning when Willis is talking to the sports agent and we never leave the seats in front of them, or when we are with the second survivor before he dies the whole time Willis is talking to the doctor. These little things break the ordinary mold of a simple conversation and adds some interesting elements to keep our attention.Shyamalan, who also writes the films he directs, shows us that he's a talented guy. He knows what stories to craft and how to tell them, sometimes they are a hit, sometimes they are a miss. Then you have his big misses, but I give the guy credit for trying something different each time. From ghosts, to aliens and unknown forces. Kudos to the guy for trying to dive into different genres.Unbreakable is never thrilling, nor edge of your seat entertainment, it's never meant to be either. There are some intense moments though, specifically when his son thinks shooting him will prove he's a superhero. Well written, directed and acted on everyone's part.I liked the film, but felt it lacked to really grab me. It just seemed to be a well done film and nothing more, nothing to want me to explore this world or the people in it. It has a lot going for it too, the cast is great, the writing is superb and it has layers that the viewers peels away at, to get to that ultimate reveal. Yet at the same time, I was never blown away by anything. Not once did I think to myself, 'Wow, this is such a great film'.I know this film has many lovers, and I'm not bashing it, I'm just saying that yes it is good, but not a masterpiece, nor his best work.",7,1,2,20 July 2009
Star Trek," Holy Lens Flare Captain!!!!
","With the recent surge in reboots of franchises and remakes, J.J. Abrams goes into a little different direction, and uses time travel as a device to play in both worlds, that being the original series and the new reboot he has created. The result is a highly entertaining film with great special effects and good performances.Going through a black hole and destroying a federation ship, Nero has altered the current time line and created an alternate universe. He's exacting revenge on other planets because his was destroyed. Can the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise stop him in time? I never watched the original series with Shatner, and caught a few episodes of The Next Generation because my dad would watch them. The series seemed to be running out of gas in films, with every single film being about throwing the ships shield's up and pretending to be hit by missiles in space. I welcome this so called 're-boot' with open arms, the series needed it in my opinion. Abrams and co have created something special here and I'm interested in seeing where they take this series.The casting choices work for me, I knew enough of the original characters to know this. For me, Urban as McCoy is the best casting decision. Quinto from Heroes fame fills the shoes of Spock, he looks the part and plays the part well. The guy looks evil every time you look at him. Pegg as Scotty is a given and newcomer Pine does the role justice and I'm glad he didn't try to impersonate Shatner here. Everyone works in their supporting roles and we are introduced to them by the numbers. I was a tad upset to only see Pegg introduced near the end of the film, but here's hoping we see more of him in future installments.The special effects were stunning. I noticed they employed the same technique used in the short lived brilliant television show Firefly, which employed quick zooms and having objects and people out of focus for a brief second while in space. Although, I'm sure during the scenes in space, it would be silenced, such as the girl flying out of the ship in the opening and Kirk & Sulu descending on the drill. Yet in other scenes we would hear the explosions of the missiles and so on. Inconsistent, but not a huge problem.The way the film is shot is beautiful, but I could do with a little less of the lens flare. I understand that it was intentional, but near the end of the film is became a little overbearing and distracting. Also Bana is underused in my opinion. I could have used a bit more with him and Kirk in the climax.The film starts off with a bang and the adrenaline is there at the end as well. The film slows down in some parts, but this is needed to fill in the spots of the story. A story that is well written and with Abrams behind the camera, well directed. Abrams has finally made the jump from television to film. His first try was the mediocre Mission Impossible III. With Star Trek it seems this guy has no fear, taking on two films that belong in a franchise, kudos.Trek is entertaining, funny and will draw in a new audience. I had a great time in the theatre and liked every minute of it. I can't wait to see the direction they take this new and exciting series. Thanks for not disappointing.",8,3,9,11 May 2009
Fury," 'Ideals are peaceful. History is violent.'
","Fury is a brutal look at the men who find themselves stuck in the death traps known as tanks, in WWII. Brad Pitt leads those men on various missions and they just lost one of their own. A typist, who has never seen the war on the front lines, never killed man, never even fired a gun, is thrown into the tank, that these men call Fury. First, he has to clean out the blood and guts from his seat, the previous person in there has left pieces of himself all over, including part of his face. Yes, Fury is gory, violent and relentless. It doesn't sugar coat the war and it shouldn't. Not only do people die left right and centre, but they do so in cruel and terrifying ways. One particular death that comes to mind is when a soldier would rather shoot himself in the head than burn alive. It's a shocking moment that makes you realize the horrors of our history. History is indeed violent. Logan Lerman is Norman Ellison, the boy barely shaves and he is thrust into battle not knowing what to do. He is against killing anyone, it's against his morals, he simply cannot do it. That is until Pitt forces him, against his will, to kill a German soldier who pleads for his life. Another depressingly realistic scene in a film full of them. Pitt knows that if he doesn't break this kid down, he will be the death of Pitt's entire crew. His crew consists of a religious gunner, an impressive Shia LaBeouf, a hot headed redneck prone to outbursts, an outstanding Jon Bernthal and their driver who is consistently drunk, the always reliable Michael Pena. These men follow the orders of WarDaddy, a scarred and nobel Brad Pitt. People might try to relate his performance to Lt. Aldo Raine from Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, but the two are very different. He puts on a confident and brave face for his men, but behind the tough exterior is a scared man, who only admits his fear once. He predictably takes Lerman under his wing, the typical father-son relationship ensues, but aside from that and a clich√É¬©d 'follow the leader at the darkest hour' scene, the film is a fresh take on the WWII genre. I say a fresh take because the focus is on the claustrophobic dynamic relationship these men have within the confines of the tank. I loved all the scenes that had me stuck inside with them. You feel the intensity in every moment. Ayer knows this and shoots the scene well enough so that even though you feel trapped, you never get lost or feel that you need to get out of the tank. When Ayer does take us out, he shows the risks and dangers of not being protected by Fury's walls. Even when you think you're safe, moments later you're not. Ayer shows his skill for the battle and the slow moving tanks make for heightened suspense. Fury doesn't match the levels of Saving Private Ryan, but it's a realistic take on a time where good and bad men on BOTH sides of the war fought for what they believed in. Fury is entertaining and harrowing at the same time.",8,2,6,20 October 2014
Memento," 'Nolan Brilliantly Constructs A Murder Mystery Film.'
","Leonard's wife has been murdered and he himself left with short-term memory loss. Now Leonard goes about life trying to catch the one who destroyed his life. He tattoos his body with clues as to who this man is and relies on pictures and his handwriting to help him remember certain things.In Christopher Nolan's film, Memento, he brilliantly constructs a murder mystery that leaves the viewer in the dark as to what really happened. Nolan structures the film in such a way that makes us feel exactly like the lead character, Leonard. The film doesn't follow any normal structure, because it begins with the ending, then ends with the stories beginning. The viewer has no idea what has happened prior to what we are being shown, much like Leonard who has short-term memory loss.Nolan uses black and white as transitional scenes between the structure of going backwards. These are breaks in the story line and act as a narration to give the viewer more insight into Leonard's condition. These scenes in black and white actually take place before the film and in the film's conclusion these scenes connect with the rest of the film. The viewer much like Leonard again must connect pieces of the story to come to a conclusion as to what has happened, but in the end the answer is ambiguous and we are told to make our own conclusion as to what happened.Leonard will never remember himself killing John G. He will always go on trying to find his killer even though he has most likely already killed him. There are no 'good' characters in this film, since everyone Leonard meets ends up using him for their benefit. Teddy uses him to kill a drug dealer, Natalie uses him to get vengeance on Teddy, and even the hotel receptionist fools Leonard by checking him into two separate rooms. The film takes more then one view to comprehend what happens and it takes a great filmmaker to be able to make people talk about something years later. Nolan has manages to become an auteur with Memento, not only being the vision behind it but the creator all together.Joe Pantoliano, who has a knack for playing evil roles, sets himself apart here and really shines. Where Pearce is most of the times flat Pantoliano brings life and comedy into the film. His Matrix co-star Carrie Ann Moss also brings a certain charm here; in her own little evil way.Everyone should watch this film at least once, trust me, you'll need more then one viewing to know what's going on. It's structure and presentation is astonishing and should be awarded so. I give thumbs up for Nolan's Memento.",10,0,2,11 August 2005
Inglourious Basterds," These Basterds Are Worth Seeing
","Once Upon A Time....In Nazi Occupied France opens the film in the first chapter (a signature Tarantino style) of this WWII film in which Jewish American soldiers, who've deemed themselves 'The Basterds', ambush and scalp Nazi's. Their story intertwines with another in which a Jewish girl survives an attack on her family and lives among the Germans as a French theatre owner. The theatre in which numerous high ranking German officials will be at, a theatre that 'The Basterds' will be at.Tarantino is a favourite director of mine, not the top, but he's up there. Many people complain he simply rips off older, better films. I say nay. He is inspired by them because he loves cinema so much. Any interview with the guy will prove his vast film knowledge, a knowledge that he has used in his film-making, giving us some of the best films of the 90's. He doesn't have many films under his belt, but the ones their are all highly praised and one even earned him an Oscar. He is able to mix different genres well and is competent in each one. His last 3 films were a throwback to grindhouse features, a two part revenge story that mixes the spaghetti western and the Asian martial arts and finally a novel adaptation. Yet his praise is mostly in his writing, which is why he has an Oscar in the first place.Inglorious Basterds is yet another film from Tarantino in which he mixes violence with characters who seem too cool for school. Brad Pitt plays Aldo Raine, the leader of the Basterds and one who can speak almost fluent Italian. He has a scar around his neck, yet it is never answered as to why, and he seems to be having too good a time here, killing Nazi's. He enlists 8 men to be apart of his squad of Basterds, along with his 2nd in command (I'm assuming) Donny Donowitz, played by Eli Roth. Who for once does not annoy me. His best scene involves the most brutal part of the film, reminiscent of Pesci's scene in Casino. Two more men join the Basterds, one is Til Schweiger, who is famous for killing 13 Nazi's in cruel and inhuman ways. The second is Michael Fassbender, a Scottish soldier posing as a German to initiate Operation Kino. A secret mission that will involve explosions and death. Seems like a lot of 'Basterds' to keep track of, and it was. Tarantino loses half of them half way through. Missing scenes from trailers would indicate there was more story for each of them, but for the film as it stands now, it's incomplete. These characters are forgettable faces, this film needed more time with it's title characters.In a Tarantino flick you can guarantee a couple things and getting good performances from his actors is definitely one of them. Brad Pitt is hilarious as Aldo and Roth is menacing as Donowitz. The short scenes with the Basterds are good, good enough to want more and feel disappointed when you don't get it. Krueger, from National Treasure fame, plays a famous actress working for the English, posing as a German. She has a thick accent and pulls off her scenes quite well. I didn't find her annoying at all, and even though M√©lanie Laurent does a decent job as the Jewish girl hiding out in France, her subplot with a German Private is boring and almost forgettable. It's not till the ending of this sub plot does it become remotely interesting, but it seems too late. The stand out is without a doubt is Christoph Waltz, playing a German who is nicknamed 'The Jew Hunter'. He plays the guy with enough kindness to make him creepy and enough crazy to make him fearful.This film tells two different stories that meet up at the end. Each one has their own fair share of subplots, that seem to distract from more time with the Basterds. There are numerous scenes that are quite shocking and will leave you with a big smile, or a disgusted look of disdain. The violence here is more gritty and real, thus it feels more involving. Kill Bill has limbs flying and gallons of blood, but it was too over the top and comical to be taken seriously. Here it has that gritty feel to it that it just makes you wince when it happens.Not Tarantino's best work, but then again will he ever top Pulp Fiction? Instead it's a welcome addition to his resume of films that I can say I enjoy. The length of this one is a little long and it may drag in some places, but the overall feel at the end is enjoyment. He takes his characters and lets them takeover the story, which is why the historical facts in this film are more interesting than others. There are countless war films that are plagued with people already knowing the outcome. Valkyrie is an example of a film that the audience knew how it was going to end. This one throws it all out the window.A tighter running time and more time spent with the people who want to see would have made this film even more fun for me, but I'll take what I can get.",8,2,9,21 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Hope...Rebellions Are Built On It.
","Rogue One has the difficult task of being the first Star Wars spin-off and having a story that doesn't revolve around any previously known Star Wars characters. Add onto that, the fact that we already know the outcome of this story. So how do we care for a story and characters when we know the ending? Rogue One tries to answer these questions and more and actually delivers something a little different for the series.The Empire is building a powerful weapon that can destroy planets and the rebels are losing time. Fearing the end to the cause, a rogue group of rebels take it upon themselves to strike first and steal the plans to the Death Star, which details a small weakness purposely built into the system. Even though I sat there knowing full-well that those death star plans make it into the hands of Princess Leia, then to R2-D2, then to the rebel alliance, which leads to Luke blowing up the Death Star.....I still found myself enthralled with Rogue One. There is a lot to digest here, so let's dig in. First, the film starts off slow and weak. We jump from planet to planet to get our bearings and are introduced to a few characters that will eventually lead the story. One such character is Cassian Andor, a rebel who first hears about this weapon. He's tasked with leading Jyn Erso to help find her father, the man who helped build the Death Star. Despite both Diego Luna and Felicity Jones being good actors, I felt a little disconnected with their characters here. Which is a shame because they are suppose to be the core emotional pull for the audience. It's their sacrifice and determination that is suppose to corral the viewers behind this team and while they try, I never felt like they really hit it high enough. Even though I was let down with their work in this film, two other characters more than make up for it. Donnie Yen's Chirrut and Alan Tudyk's K-2SO steal the show. Yen's trust in the force makes him a weapon of mass destruction despite being blind. He has numerous 'kick- ass' scenes that brought a smile to my face....the man has a stick for crying out loud. Then we have Tudyk, the comic relief. His android is above and beyond more interesting and tolerable than previous tall androids from the series. Yes, C-3PO is annoying. Here K-2SO is given a winning personality and Tudyk runs with it. It doesn't hurt that he knows how to take out some Stormtroopers as well. Ben Mendelssohn is always reliable when you need him to look menacing and play up the villain role. He does so here, to great effect. The one cast member who totally blows it though and is hilariously awful is Forrest Whittaker. I'm not sure what he was thinking when he decided to play up this character, but he ruins all the scenes he is in. He brings the film down a few pegs and is one of the main reasons why the first half of this film is rather weak. Things eventually pick up and the film finishes strong. A much better second half, which takes the film into a more war like genre, creates suspense, thrills and genuine excitement to see space battles again. So where does this film fall on the Star Wars scale? Well, it certainly is better than the prequels and some might even say better than Force Awakens, but I feel that some hardcore fans will feel a little put off by Rogue One. It feels different. It's more depressing, more action and chaos oriented. No jedi and even no John Williams. This is the first film not scored by John Williams. It's noticeable, not bad in any way, just noticeable. No opening crawl text either. I can see these small things rubbing those hardcore fans the wrong way, but do not be alarmed, this film is entertaining and worth the watch. Ever since Benjamin Button was able to digitally make Brad Pitt look like he's in his twenties again, films have been using this to their advantage. They have not perfected it yet, people still look a little weird when digitally altered. Rogue One does this with some key characters, mainly Grand Moff Tarkin. Great to see the man in this film and it looks pretty decent as well. Sometimes though, it might take you out of the film experience. Then we have another classic character pop up, Darth Vader. Anyone who has seen the trailers know he's here. His screen time is limited...but the second time he shows up is probably the best scene involving Darth Vader in the entire series. Bold statement, but everything about the sequence was so well executed that I couldn't have asked for anything more. A satisfying Star Wars film that tries to be a little different. Despite knowing how it will all end, the film does an admirable job of making you care for some of the characters and giving you edge of your seat excitement and entertainment. Easily recommended.",8,3,12,15 December 2016
Iron Man 2," More of the same...but not.
","People faulted this film for being good, but not great. What the hell, so will I. Iron Man 2 has all the right ingredients to make a great summer blockbuster superhero film, yet the final product is more of what we already saw, minus the heart. Iron Man 2 has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man fighting off Ivan Vanko, a man hellbent on revenge, as well as a new arms dealer Justin Hammer. For the sake of cramming more characters in sequels, like all sequels do, we also have Natasha Romanoff/Natalie Rushman, better known as Black Widow. Black Widow, or the eye candy known as Scar Jo, adds nothing to the film for me. This was one of my worries, too much going on. Iron Man isn't overloaded like X-3 was, but it was getting there. The story is the classic revenge tale, with Mickey Rourke as the villain. A role he was only given because of his recent career revival with The Wrestler. If you watch The Expendables, you'll notice he looks exactly the same as he does here. Almost as if they were shooting next door and he wandered onto the set. Ivan, isn't that memorable as a villain (looks don't count). Rourke tried his best, but there just wasn't much there in the script. The action set pieces are entertaining enough to appeal to a younger audience. The threat level doesn't feel as big, with the addition of War Machine, again more stuff added, it just felt like we were waiting for Iron Man to succeed. The stakes simply weren't high enough for me to really care this time around.The party scene with Tony in the Iron Man suit, drunk and shooting off missiles in his house was laughable and was just added to have the two character fight each other. Superhero sequels tend to be a but better (X2, Spiderman 2) but this one just dropped the ball a bit. I don't know if the first one set the bar too high or if the filmmakers were just a bit lazy. Either way, we lost out a bit on this one.",6,2,4,8 February 2011
Alien: Resurrection," It Had Interesting Ideas
","Ripley is cloned and brought back. She wasn't alone though, they also brought back the alien that was inside her. With a crew bringing some cargo on board the same ship these alien experiments go awry and the aliens escape. All that is left is Ripley and the crew of the Betty. The reason why I think this film gets so much hate is because it seems to cheapen the ending to Alien 3, which was the best thing about that film. It ended her legacy and the story in the franchise and now comes a fourth film that many thought was a cash cow waiting to be milked. Alien: Resurrection has some interesting ideas, but the execution of the film as a whole just seems like a misfire. The first had terror, the second had action the third had the ending, the only way to end the series. What does this one have? Again, the cash cow thing comes to mind. The producers thought if they got geek writer Joss Whedon and French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, they could fool the audience. It would seem that two rights can't make a wrong. Joss Whedon's original script was obviously changed, but in interviews he said that his final draft is what is seen on the screen. So what's the problem? The execution apparently. While Whedon went for a tongue in cheek aspect, Jeunet went down the straight and narrow and made the film serious. So I guess two rights can make a wrong. The characters are interesting and the actors portraying them I thought was the best thing about the film. Ron Perlman and Gary Dourdan are the two stand outs in my opinion. Weaver isn't the same Ripley we once knew and loved. She is different. Part alien, she acts like one in the film. Again, it was an interesting idea, but I found myself liking her less and less. Not as much as I hated Ryder though, she was irritating and boring. The film is looked upon as the worst one. Or the one that could be tossed up between Alien 3 as the worst. It's no bag of dirt. It's watchable, a lot better than the last two alien films we got. The problem was there was no emotion, specifically for a character who was different than what we knew. The script was written one way and the direction went in another. Neither was right or wrong, but together it doesn't work that well. The underwater sequence is great though, definitely the stand out scene among a bunch of boring running down corridors bits. Alien: Resurrection has no sense of danger or terror. All three previous films had this in abundance. The story tried it's best to bring back the character of Ripley, but we got a shallow clone. The human/alien hybrid wasn't scary, it looked like less of a threat than the normal aliens. The climax was non-existent and should have taken place on Earth, it would have added a bit more urgency. The film looks great though. Cheers.",6,1,1,16 May 2010
The Hunger Games," The World Is Watching.
","The Capitol selects one boy and one girl from each of the 12 districts to compete in a fight till the death on live television event. 24 enter, one leaves, this is the Hunger Games. It's incredibly hard not to compare this film to Battle Royale, I hate to do so, but the similarities are there and unfortunately for The Hunger Games, Battle Royale did it better. In the end, I did like it, but I can't help but feel that it was a lot of build up, with a mediocre delivery of the most important aspect of the film. They talk about how deadly the games are, how it's a fight for survival, but I never really felt that danger. I really do hate comparing it to Battle Royale, but that had a sense of danger. Battle Royale felt deadly, the characters seemed like they've been through hell, you felt sad to see characters die, here, not so much. The most deadly part was the bloodbath that occurred when characters ran to their weapons, then it seemed to be an autopilot. I might be the only one to say this, but this would actually work better as a television show. That way we can feel how devastating these games are, how long they are, how deadly they are. The film does not get this point across, at least not to me.Jennifer Lawrence was good in the lead role of Katniss, the only volunteer for the games. She shows how brave and heroic a female character can be (you suck Bella). She kicks more ass than any other character. That's another downfall, none of the other kids are really memorable. I wanted something unique for each kid to be memorable, but if they didn't speak a line, they were basically ghosts. There are 24 kids, with the exception of the obvious (Lawrence, Hutcherson, the 'villain' kid, and the little black girl) everyone else fades away. I'm not asking for screen time to be dedicated to each one, but make some of them memorable. I knew who the redhead was because she had red hair, that's it. Again, Battle Royale did this right. They had the tech guys, the evil guy, the medical girls, the crazy girl, the romantics, the hero, etc. The smallest detail is enough to make someone in the background memorable. I had no idea who was dying.The supporting characters are poorly written, specifically Hutherson's character Peeta. Hell, Liam Hemsworth's character Gale does absolutely nothing in the film except brood about Katniss, and yet one little scene where he grabs her little sister to take to her mother screams more about his character than anything Peeta does. Banks, Kravitz and Harrelson all serve to make Katniss all that she can be. Harrelson has some backstory to him, he won a previous game and has since become an alcoholic. I hope more of the world is explored in the follow up films. They barely scratch the surface here, just the basics are given, which is really all we need for the first one, but I was hoping for a bit more of this world to be shown, specifically the Districts. I actually thought that all three books were about the games and that's what the films would be about. So when they wrapped up the game, I thought to myself, where are they going to go from here? But I suspect there will be some uprising and new characters introduced. As a stand lone flick, The Hunger Games works. It doesn't really leave you wanting to go deeper into the story, but it does tell the story it needs to tell and leaves it in a bow for you. It may not be a nice little bow, but it's enough.The detractors of the film are many, like the love between Katniss and Peeta. It's never really explained if she does love him or if she is only doing it for the show and to survive. I suspect the latter will eventually turn into the former, but as of right now, the film does not make this clear. The shaky camera work distracts as well. Even when no action is taking place, we are all over the screen, making it hard to connect to those speaking. The film is also a tad lengthy, which can be bothersome to some, running at two hours and twenty minutes.Despite those nitpicks, the film is entertaining. I guess I just expected a bit more from it, hearing rave reviews and it making millions. The training sequences are exciting and the initial build up, mainly the countdown, to the actual games is thrilling. As I said, I did like the film, I just had to point out those problems. As a film targeted towards teens, I recommend it.",7,1,7,3 April 2012
12 Monkeys," One Of The Best Time Travel Movies To Grace The Screen
","James Cole is sent back in time to stop a virus that destroys humanity. He must look for clues to lead him to the group known as the 12 monkeys, but is sent too far back in time and ends up as an insane patient in a hospital. Know he must escape the hospital and continue his mission.With a brilliant script, a unique vision and a superb cast, 12 monkeys makes it mark in cinema history as one of the best time travel movies to grace the screen. 12 Monkeys is a film that will take multiple viewings to comprehend, and even then there is still new aspects of the film that appear to you with every viewing. Everything in this film clicks together so well, making it one of the best films of the 90's.Terry Gilliam is a director that looks at the world at an angle, he brings this angle to his films. One only has to view his previous films, such as Brazil to see how far off the edge this guy is. With 12 Monkeys he brings us a film that is off the chart is bizarre weirdness, but is able to make the film make sense in the end. Which is hard for any time travel flick. Unlike other films that deal with time travel, 12 monkeys makes the entire act of time travel seem believable. Gilliam has an impressive track record and 12 monkeys is near the top of it.Brad Pitt stands out in this film as the totally insane patient that befriends Willis. What did Gilliam do to make Pitt so nuts in this film? Simply take away his cigarettes. Maybe Pitt should stop smoking all together and his other films will be as good as this one. Pitt gives this dark and morose film a funny bone. Willis, who normally is mediocre in his films shines here. Along with Stowe, this cast brings a whole new level to the film.The film itself is off the wall and ahead of it's time. It's dark and brilliant. The only fault would be that in some scenes it drags a bit. 12 Monkeys is a film that will still be talked about in years to come. It is definitely one of the best films for everyone involved. It's madness starts from the first shot right up until the last second, it never lets it's out of place style end. Which is what makes this film so good.",8,3,4,16 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," 'Great In Doses...But The Film Accomplishes Nothing'
","Captain Jack Sparrow owes an unpaid debt to Davy Jones and his underwater sea creatures. The deal was that he would be captain of the black pearl for 13 years, in return for his soul. Time's up for Jack and he must pay up. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the much anticipated sequel to POC: Curse of the Black Pearl. With every sequel, one must be able to up the ante. People expect more action, more adventure, more danger, and more love challenged between the characters. At first glance it would seem that Dead Man's Chest would deliver all of this and more. Unfortunately, it suffers from many things and relies on too much in order to get the audience to go along with the ride. When compared to the original, and you always compare the sequel to the original, Dead Man's Chest doesn't match up. The film is good, it was quite good and it will most definitely entertain, but the film doesn't seem to accomplish all too much.Dead Man's Chest and it's soon to be released sequel At World's End (what a goofy title) takes a note from the Matrix trilogy. Both movies were filmed at the same time and will most likely start off directly where the other left off. The ending to DMC does in fact set up everything in the third. Much like reloaded though, no matter how good this film is, it won't be able to touch the original. My main complaint is that the characters accomplish nothing. DMC is a much darker film then Pearl, at the end the characters are basically left with nothing which is suppose to make us want to see the next installment even more to see how they get out of such predicaments, specifically speaking, Jack Sparrow's current situation. But like I said before, the characters accomplish nothing. At the beginning of the film, Will and Elizabeth are suppose to get married, they don't, They are suppose to get the Dead Man's Chest, they don't. Will is suppose to free his father, he doesn't. Jack is suppose to the souls, he doesn't. DMC is just one long set up for the third film, which makes me beg the question. Did this story really need to be split up into two films? There was so much that they could have cut out in order to condense the two film into one. But alas, we live in a greedy world.Depp, does very well with Sparrow, as is expected. Although, Sparrow seemed to come off as too feminine in this film, I don't know if this was just me but that's what I got from Depp's performance. From the way he would run to the way he would try and grab the key off the Commodore. This doesn't hurt the film all too much, but it can be distracting. Bloom, he seemed to annoy me in this film. As he does in every other film he is in, save for LOTR. Not necessarily his performance, but his voice. The way he tries to seem commanding but comes off as a pretty boy. Keira Knightley was alright here, she doesn't do all that much and there is no real chemistry here between her or Bloom. Or even character development for that matter. Hats off to Nighy, he did a superb job replacing Rush as the main villain. The special effects of his character were very well done and you can see how they modeled this character after him with every expression that he makes. His 'sea phantoms' are another great treat for the eyes. These guys make the skeletons in the original look like nothing. I really enjoyed seeing the ship burst out from underneath the water surface. Skarsg√•rd was another treat, for the very little screen time that he had, he did a mighty fine job. But what was with the voodoo chick? I did not understand half of what she said.The special effects are great and are perfect for the 'summer blockbuster adventure' film. From the giant sea creature to the sea phantoms, everything is top notch. I spotted one or two off beat parts but that's mainly due to the crazy factor of what was on the screen. Seeing the creature destroy the ships was great. But that's the only real adventure action type sequences we get. Other then a long and drawn out sword fight on a giant wheel, that was cool at first, but once it kept rolling, the cool factor was rolling away with it. The sword fights do not match the original in any way, but that's not supposed to be the highlight, it's the huge sea creature destroying everything in its path.The comedy did seem forced in some parts. You could tell that they were going for the funny in some scenes but it doesn't always work. Sparrow is basically one joke after the other, or one funny look after the other. There are funny parts in the film, but it just tried to capture the same spirit as the original, but it doesn't. The score is great and has that 'adventurous' feel to it, even if it is played once too many. But when you have a great score like that, or Superman, you're suppose to play it every chance you get.In the end, Dead Man's Chest is a good summer action adventure film. It does deliver on the action, the comedy (in parts), the excitement, the special effect and the enjoyment. Although, you may find yourself wondering what more they could have done, why the film is so long with so many things that do not even need to be in here. As well as with the final scene, you may have some questions that you can only pray for get answered in the final¬Öhopefully final installment.",7,4,8,8 July 2006
Argo," Affleck Brings Back 70's Cinema.
","As the Iranian revolution nears a climax, a CIA specialist comes up with a risky plan to rescue six Americans who are hiding at the home of the Canadian Ambassador. The plan? A fake movie. With two good films under his belt Ben Affleck has already solidified himself as a competent director. With Argo he ventures into the must see category. Argo is easily one of the best films of the year and reminds us of the films we use to love back in the 70's. Not only does the film look like it takes place in the 70's, but it feels like it too. Blowing the picture up to give it the grainy feel, greatly adds to the overall experience. Multiple times I got the feeling that Affleck was trying to pull off an All The Presidents Men vibe, especially in the CIA offices and it works. While I'm sure Affleck took some liberties with the events, it never feels like any of this couldn't have happened. Affleck is a CIA operative and not once does he fire a gun, fight the bad guys or be 007. This film is 100% talking, yet is one of the most suspenseful films of the year. Where does the suspense come from? If their cover is blown, they are all dead. Can these people fake being a film crew? Does everyone make it out alive? Even if you know how the real story turns out, Affleck manages to keep the tension throughout the entire third act intact. I do wish that Affleck would have given Canadians more credit though. They did most of the work, took most of the risk and in the film it feels as if they were babysitters while Mendez comes up with this Hollywood Option and does everything to get them out. So it does feel like Hollywood trying to take credit for something they were let in on, but that's a small gripe in a fantastic film. Boasting an impressive cast: Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston, Tate Donovan, Victor Garber, Clea DuVall, Rory Cochrane, Kyle Chandler and Ben Affleck staple Titus Welliver, everyone brings their A-game, no matter how small the role. Of course Affleck has to have his obligatory shirt off shot. Argo is everything a movie should be, a great story, compelling drama and light hearted humour. Like I said earlier, it brings back the days of 70's cinema, complete with thick glasses, dorky haircuts and goofy moustaches. The film's credits put up the actors with their real person counterparts. Plus images from the film are literally taken from pictures taken during the events. It's a scary situation to be in and Affleck puts that front and centre. Go see Argo",8,20,41,13 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," An entertaining sequel that falls a hair short.
","Kirk is given the task of tracking down John Harrison, the man responsible for the death of hundreds of Starfleet Commanders, but upon capturing him, the crew of the enterprise learns of more sinister evils lurking in the darkness. The film starts off Kirk disobeying direct orders from Starfleet in order to save the life of a crew member. The result of this action has him demoted from captain, yet this subplot only lasts 5 minutes as he is thrust back into the role after a devastating hit from the new villain, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. So the film starts off pretty shaky, having something important happen that ultimate goes nowhere for the story. Once Cumberbatch comes on the screen, the film becomes stronger and more focused. This new Star Trek film dances around revenge, sacrifice and friendship. The relationship between Spock and Kirk is stronger, almost a complete 180 from what we saw in the original film. Despite this new strong friendship, Spock still has trouble conveying emotions and thinks more logically than emotionally. This film tries to be bigger and pose a more dangerous threat to our crew than the original, as most sequels do, but in order for that to happen, a lot of the characters are given the short straw. Zoe Saldana, John Cho and Anton Yelchin get the worst of it. Saldana is belittled to a girlfriend role, Cho only drives the ship and Yelchin is thrown into the back and literally does nothing. Pegg, Quinto and Pine take the front roles and of course Cumberbatch steals the show whenever he's on the screen. I can't help be feel a tad disappointed that most of the crew is given little to do, whereas everyone in the original had a moment to shine. Into Darkness is a good entertaining film, that falls a tad bit short of its predecessor. It's still a great film, but there are too many telegraphed scenes that leave the emotion empty because you know where they writers are going to go with it. Big reveals are not shocking and the predictable ending leaves a bad taste in my mouth. They had a chance to throw a big curveball and make us salivate for the next film, but instead we are treated with the 'Spielberg' ending, something that I think Abrams is becoming more and more guilty of. Those detractors are not enough to make the film a disappointment. It is highly enjoyable popcorn flair. Those worried about lens flare? He tones it down this time!!! YAY!!!!",8,1,5,20 May 2013
Hostel," 'Not The Shocking Horror We Wanted, Or Need'
","3 friends backpacking through Europe look for sex and booze. They hear about some kind of Hostel that offers beautiful naked women and no attachments. They go off in search for this place, but instead find a torture house. Soon they are finding themselves in a heap of trouble.Eli Roth is being hailed as the new face of horror. As of right now, with the current features under his belt; I must ask myself, why does this guy have this title? Granted I liked Cabin Fever, with it's homages left right and centre to the genre, but was it good enough to have its director considered 'Horror Master'? After watching Hostel, I still sit here dumbfounded.Upon this films release (and after it as well) the only thing I kept hearing was how sick and twisted it was. How there was no real story and that a film like this should not be in print. Being the horror fanatic that I am, I was hoping to see something that I, and the fans of the genre, can enjoy while everyone else trashed it. Now after seeing Hostel, I sit here on the fence as to whether or not I liked it. It's not the vile, porn-torture, disgust of a film that I thought it was, but it wasn't a horrible piece of trash either.Roth knows the genre well, which is evident in how he presents the film and the style throughout. This is it's high and low points. The film looks beautiful in the second half, but Roth overexposes the viewer to what makes horror movies horror movies. For example, an action film usually has gun fire and car chases; horror films usually have blood, sex and violence. In Hostel, we get overexposed with an obscene amount of nudity, then the second half is an obscene amount of sadistic violence. The film plays like two different movies. The first half is soft core porn and is shot like a teen slasher film, while the second is 'considered' a snuff film, shot with a grittier look.My problems with the film are scattered throughout it's running time. For everything good in the film, there is something bad. Horror films are suppose to make you feel a certain number of things. One is to be scared, yet this film is not scary. Instead Roth relies on graphic violence to scare his audience. People claim that the film is a gory trip through hell and back. Did I miss the train? Hostel, to sum up in one sentence: Does Not Live Up To The Hype. I don't know if it's the sick films I've seen prior (Cannibal Holocaust, Dead-Alive, Evil Dead), but Hostel is not what it seems. The film tries to go for shock, but fails to deliver any in its poor attempt.I appreciate the acknowledgement of other horror films Roth shows us. Any horror fan can point out certain places and things Roth homages. One that I liked was seeing Takishi Miike walk out of the warehouse. Here is a person Roth admires greatly and by the time you're reading this has probably already directed 3 more films. While I am not a total fan of Takishi yet, I can respect his films. You can see a touch of his style here. Nobody should be fooled by the title Tarantino Presents. Other then promoting a friends film, he has no touch here. It's a shame, cause this film could have used a touch up.It is suspenseful in some scenes, but the way Roth constructs them is horrible. We are suppose to believe that the main character will go back to save a life, simply because of one line of dialogue earlier? To explain, our so called hero says that he once saw someone die and he could have done something to save her. Later on in the film he hears the screaming of a woman and goes to try and save her. Despite this never happening in real life(unless the person is someone you know/love) the fact that the only suspense in the film comes from this poor explanation, it taints the rest of the film.So in the end, I can't recommend this to any real horror fan, or even people looking for a good film. Instead watch it if you're a fan of the stuff. If your favourite movies include Saw Wolf Creek, then Hostel may be the film for you. I found myself wanting to enjoy it, but simply couldn't. I'll have to wait and see what Roth can deliver to us later, then maybe he can earn his horror title.",5,1,2,14 August 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," With Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Narnia Is Adventure-Lite.
","Four children walk through a wardrobe and discover a land of mystery and enchantment. After the youngest learns that her friend from the land of Narnia has been kidnapped, she pleads for her brothers and sister to help rescue him. Once meeting the creatures that live in Narnia the siblings soon discover that they are some kind of prophecy written heroes. The Kings and Queens of Narnia that are said to rid the Witch of her evil reign with the help of Aslan, the lion.Narnia seemed like the perfect film of the year that had adventure, excitement, and fantasy all rolled into one entertaining film. Based on the books, which are loved by millions, Narnia had a huge step to overcome in pleasing it's devoted fans. It's too bad that in a world with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Narnia is adventure-lite. It's scope seems bigger then what it's reality is. Even when judging it against another book turned film, Series of Unfortunate Events, Narnia seems to be lagging behind in last place.To begin with, the children are not likable at all. The little one who is suppose to be cute is annoying, the younger brother is a pain in the ass, the older sister has too little screen time to make any kind of connection, while the oldest is just too dumb. Not to mention that all the actors playing them were annoying to listen to. Other then the main characters, who we are stuck with no matter what. The supporting cast, the witch, the Faun and the deep and perfect voice of Aslan, Liam Neeson make up, a little bit, for what the children actors lack.Nothing really exciting happen in the film. When you have a fantasy film such as this, that promises an adventure, you would expect something a little bit more then what the result is. It takes thirty some odd minutes for all the children to finally get into Narnia, after that they encounter a beaver and learn what the place is and who they supposedly are. After a quick run in with some wolves, and the younger brother in the hands of the witch, nothing else happens, save for the final battle. The kids are safe in their 'terrirtory' where the heroes of the film train for the final battle. Then the final battle occurs, which is something right out of a card game Magic: The Gathering.There's not too much of an emotional attachment to any of the characters, so when one is near death, we can't seem to care. This installment is a weak first entry to something that could be a successful series. Narnia does contain beautiful images, ranging from snowy mountain tops, to green valleys. It's a beautiful film, with great special effects, costume designs and set pieces. They have created a wonderful world where these creatures live in. Go into Narnia expecting a wild adventurous time, then you will be disappointed. Hoping to expect to see a massive battle scene, skip it, it can't hold a candle to anything that Jackson served us. See this, for beautiful images or if you're a fan of the material, whether you will be satisfied or not is up for debate, as I've never read the books.",6,0,0,15 April 2006
Green Room," What's your 'desert-island' band?
","Saulnier's Blue Ruin was a shotgun blast to the chest of intense thrills from an unknown director. I had no idea what to expect from Blue Ruin, but when it was over my wife simply turned to me and said, 'That was intense'. So I was excited to see his next film get some big name recognition on board. The late Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Alia Shaukat and Picard himself, Patrick Stewart showcase their talents in this nail bitter of a follow-up.A down on their luck punk rock band take a gig at a neo-nazi club. Reluctant at first, but in desperate need for cash, they accept and play a decent gig. Just as they are about to leave, they see a dead body in the green room and bad decision are made after that. Now it's skinheads versus the punk rockers for survival. Green Room is not for the faint of heart, I'm a horror lover and I found myself cringing every so often at the shock and awe that Saulnier throws at the screen. He's not afraid to get things going fast and when he does, he turns Green Room up to eleven. I found myself asking, how are they going to get out of this? Multiple times even. Each time an attempt was made to leave, something terrible happens and Saulnier is not one for cheap gore tricks. He is restrained and holds back until you least expect it. Then the terror unleashes on the screen and it's too late to look away. Blue Ruin was about suspense, this is about terror. Locked up in one location, Green Room is a no holds barred 'us versus them' flick that surprises the viewer at a few turns. Most of the cast serve their purpose of being terrified for their lives and having to fight when needed. It's Stewart, known for his roles as courageous and commanding men (Picard, Professor X) that turns in a subtle and low-key performance. The man is the leader of skinheads and has the opportunity to unleash terror, but he holds back and almost has adds a fatherly figure to it. He mentors these young men so full of hate and he has to immediately take control of an out of control situation. Something about the calmness he has makes it even more terrifying. Men like this exist in the world.",8,11,22,3 January 2017
The Babadook," ba...ba.....DOOOOOOOK.
","Here is a film that has received a lot of positive buzz this past year. Receiving especially high acclaim from The Exorcist directed himself William Friedkin. So, being the horror nut that I am, I knew I had to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.A depressed and troubled widow, Amelia, has raised her six-year-old son Samuel alone. It's extremely difficult for her because the kid is beyond troublesome. Constantly yelling, threats of violence and an obsession with weapons has driven her to her boiling point. One day a children's book appears on his bookshelf. She reads it to him...big mistake. The grotesque pop-up book details murder and mayhem for the young child at the hands of The Babadook. Throwing the book away doesn't help, because he has already been unleashed. The first thing I noticed, besides how annoying this kid was, was the art direction of the house. How incredibly blue and grey everything was. It was striking how drab the interior was and how it matched her depression. Kent, the director, has cited Polanski and Lynch as influences. This film feels like an odd mix between Eraserhead and Rosemary's Baby. So those inspirations shine through here and it makes for a well done horror film. Very few horror film rely on real genuine scares, they instead opt for the cheap jump scares that heavily rely on sound rather than sight. The Babadook doesn't really go that route. Thank heavens. It slowly builds the tension and releases the horror at the right moments. We see glimpses of 'him', like Bruce in Jaws, which amps up the fear.I can understand people being put off of the film due to the kid. He does ruin the picture at times. I get that he is suppose to annoy, irritate and make the viewer want to inflict pain onto the poor lad, much like the mother feels, but there is a breaking point. He does a good enough job, but I totally understand where people are coming from in their dislike for the film because of his performance. The mother does a good job here as well. We feel tired like here throughout the beginning of the picture. Kent manages to switch the fear here. We fear for the mother, then we fear for the kid. It was an interesting move between characters. With real scares, The Babadook is this years The Conjuring. Enjoy yourself....ba...ba.....DOOOOOOOK.",7,1,3,22 November 2015
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Doesn't Feel Like A Longer Episode.
","I have an odd relationship with South Park. I never watch the show when it is on, yet I own the first two seasons on DVD. I find the show funny, but never watch it consistently enough to get the jokes that my friends make when they refer to an episode. I've never seen the film until now too. I get the appeal it has, but I just never really got into it.The film, as is with any film adaptation from a TV show plays out like a longer episode from the series. This time there is a war against CANADA because of a film that contains foul language. Why a war? Well, the kids are swearing. That is it. The film is basically Matt Stone and Trey Parker's thoughts on the current state of censorship with the MPAA and the films they rate.For a cartoon, yes it has a wide variety of curse words, which are spoken by kids in grade school. There is violence, blood and guts grace the screen in a hospital (with cameo voice acting from George Clooney) and the final war scene between Canada and the States. There is also a bit of nudity, which is their version of heaven.I laughed more at the subtle humour then the in your face bits. I didn't find myself laughing at the language they use which is one of the main draws (damn those young teenage boys who like swear words). There is a smart film here, but when you listen to it, it sounds like it was written to two 15 year old boys who think every bad word is funny.Did I forget to mention it is a musical? The musical numbers are nice and sometimes funny. Hell, one earned an Oscar nomination. Sometimes the humour in the film is so random that it's funny, like a Skeet Ulrich poster above Satan's bed. I don't know who would think up of something like that, but it works.If you're a fan of the show, this film will appeal to you. If not, I would suggest looking elsewhere. I dug it for what it was, but Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done better and funnier things.",7,1,2,20 July 2009
Ted," Family Guy Uncensored.
","When a little boy wishes his teddy bear could actually talk to him, he wakes up the next morning to see his wish come true. Best friends/thunder buddies for life they say. Flash forward 25 years or so and now that little boy is Mark Walhberg and that teddy is Seth McFarlane. Mila Kunis is Walhberg's girlfriend and when things get out of control says it's either going to be her or the bear.I know that going into this film that it was going to be 90 minutes of Family Guy jokes and that's a pretty accurate description. So if you love Family Guy style humour, you'll really enjoy this. I think Family Guy 'use' to be funny and ever since it came back from cancellation, it's been stale. Ted, manages to be both. A lot of the jokes misfire and a lot of them hit. I have to give McFarlane credit though, he only used one flashback gag.Family Guy is notorious for having jokes about random celebrities and you either get it or you don't. That's the same with Ted. A Brandon Routh joke and numerous Tom Skeritt jokes get no laughs, but plenty of others do. McFarlane, a fan of the 80's, plants numerous 80's jokes here. Flash Gordon being a big one. I found myself laughing more times than not, but when a joke falls flat, boy does it ever. Ted gives McFarlane more room for crude humour. There's plenty of cursing in this film. A bear that swears is funny for a short while, but when the film tries to get a laugh out of him simply standing there and saying the F-word, then you know it's stretching. Sex, drugs and language fill this film, so it's certainly not for kids, even if the young ones do watch Family Guy. This is McFalane's first venture into the film world and it shows. He has no cinematic eye and doesn't know when to leave a scene. The end result is a wash.Many of McFarlane's friends and co-workers show up here. Mila Kunis, if the most obvious one, she has a starring role, but the supporting cast is basically a who's who of McFalane's shows. Patrick Warburton, Patrick Stewart, Alex Borstein and Ralph Garman just to name a few. Friends helping out friends I guess. Joel McHale plays Mila Kunis' jerk boss who always makes advances at her, that subplot literally goes nowhere. Finally Giovanni Ribisi amps up the creep factor and takes the story in a totally different direction in the third act.In the end, Ted is a funny film. The best way for me to recommend it is based on Seth McFarlane's comedy. He wrote, produced, directed and voices Ted. It's got his mark all over it. If you like his comedy and television shows, Ted will be a laugh riot. If not, I would probably say avoid it.",7,2,8,29 June 2012
Oldboy," 'Brilliant Performance and Direction'
","Old Boy Dae-Su Oh gets imprisoned for 15 years not knowing why, every so often music will play and gas will enter the room, knocking him out. Every time he awakens hair cut, shaved and the room have been cleaned. Upon his release he has 5 days to find out why in the first place and by whom his captors were.This is the second film by Park in series of revenge films. After seeing this film, I am very eager to view Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the upcoming third installment. Park shows his talent in this film as he shows us a beautifully choreographed corridor fight scene, with no cuts. The camera simply pans back and forth through the action and the fights scenes aren't those one guy takes on ten with high flying action, it's real, it's grounded and he still takes on ten guys.Min-sik Choi gives one of the best performances I've seen in awhile and the bad guy, although not as dynamic as Choi, holds up well as well. The other supporting cast are able to portray real emotions and make the whole movie work and come all together in the performances. In the climax of the film, Choi gives not only a brilliant performance, but a weird one, that will have you either in tears of sorrow, or laughter. It's great seeing him try to adapt to the world, after being imprisoned for 15 years, like what he would do if he were to see a woman.The film is violent, not in a killing way, because most of the deaths are taken place off-screen. The violence comes from torture scenes, you know, where a guy takes a hammer and takes out the guys teeth...ouch. There is a plot twist, and it is a big one. I was shocked and it stuck with me for ten or so minutes, the twist is controversial, which may put off a lot of American audiences, but I believe it makes the film what it is.You feel sorrow for the main character, and even the bad guy, but can't really grasp this emotion until the climax of the film, a little late if you ask me, but the emotion that that scene brings out is in top form. It's a scene that goes down in history as disturbing, heart-wrenching, violent, suspenseful, funny, shocking...all in one.So what can I say about this film, well, it's one to watch, maybe more then once, because it could be difficult for some to grasp at first, or even if you do, may be hard to actually 'believe'. Aside from that, this film is a treat for the eyes as one of the best revenge films to grace the screen.",9,9,79,14 September 2005
Spider-Man 2," 'With the actors more comfortable in their roles, Spider-Man 2 swings high'
","Peter Parker can't seem to catch a break. Being Spiderman has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned. Not only that, Mary Jane is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him he decides that he doesn't want to be Spiderman anymore. Then a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus. Peter realizes that only Spiderman can stop him, but of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames Spiderman for the death of his father, wants him dead.Sam Raimi being the Spider-Man fan that he is, finally is able to treat the audience with a superhero movie to be remembered. Spider Man 2 goes down in history as one of those sequels that is able to out due it's predecessor.The sequel improves on so many things that were wrong in the original, here the actors are finally comfortable in their roles, like Kristen, I didn't believe her in the first one, but this one I did. She was able to showcase her emotions more and the chemistry was there. Franco's character and performance was over-the-top. But Franco uses this to his advantage and pulls it of. Alfred Molina stole the show in this film, he was Doc Ock, perfect villain and perfect for the role. McGuire is now Spider-Man, whereas in the original, we only saw him as the nerdy Peter Parker, it took him two tries, but he finally nailed it.I loved how it went all Evil Dead in the doctor scene, with the people screaming, then out of nowhere BOOM, chainsaw, classic Sam Raimi and a great homage to his best film to date. But who can forget the Bruce Campbel cameo, and Hal sparks of course. Was there too much comedy??? well, I'm 50/50 on that, the one scene that everyone seemed to hate, but I loved would be the 'Rain drops keep falling on my head'The little freeze at the end had my laughing, because it's Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle comedy for perfect situations. Although there was too much comedy from Peter and not enough from Spidey...I only recall one comedic thing said from Spidey, to Doc Ock in the bank...something along the lines of 'Here's your change', then throws money at him. Where is the friendly neighborhood Spidey we all grew up with and love.The train fight is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. I was waiting for him arms to rip out of their sockets when he was trying to stop the train from crashing over the edge. The CGI is a big improvement here, it's not all goofy comic book looking, here we see a man swing from building to building, anybody notice the costume looks darker in the CGI moments, maybe it was just me but it does.One gripe with the villain...not enough screen time. I wanted to see more of him, but whenever he's on the screen, you know it's good. It's clear that Molina is the scene stealer here.The film though was a little lengthy, they could of taken out a 'swinging moment' here and there, those were all over the place. Raimi ends the movie perfectly, setting up the third installment, with the look of 'Am I doing the right thing?' on MJ's face. Nice homage to The Graduate. Raimi flushes this film full of classic homages, whether it's from his own, or just classic films like King Kong, they always add a nice touch of coolness to the film.This is one of the better superhero movies out there, the fans of Spider-Man will enjoy and the movie goer will be entertained, this is a winner in my books",8,1,2,14 October 2005
127 Hours," A great performance from Franco.
","I applaud the film for being as entertaining and engrossing as it could possibly be, considering it's about a guy who gets his hand trapped by a big boulder and he just stands there for the rest of the film. I knew Danny Boyle would be able to pull it off though, the guy is talented. Aron Ralston, an adrenalin junkie, becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering by by his lonesome in Utah. He tries all he can to escape, but it's not enough, until he's faced with the alternative, death. He takes drastic measures to ensure his life will prevail. I walked away from the film with one thought in my mind, could I do the same thing. Well, for one thing I wouldn't be alone, but in this situation, I would definitely try everything I could to try and get out of that situation first. Would I pass out from cutting off my own arm? Who knows, but I do know that the will to live is indeed a powerful thing. The film displays this tremendously. Beautifully shot and wonderfully edited, the film grabs you from the moments it starts and never lets you go. I was astonished to hear that some people were bored by it. Given the circumstances, I asked what did they expect from a movie about a guy who's trapped by a boulder. The real Ralston has stated that the film is as close to the real thing as anything, it could be a documentary. Another feat accomplished by Boyle and Franco, to truly capture the man in his most desperate moments. Ralston gave his seal of approval to the film and the performance, so do I.The scene in which he has to cut off his own arm is not as graphic as I expected. It surely does look real enough though. I can easily recommend this film, Boyle delivers another great film that he can add to his impressive resume. Franco gives his best performance to date.",8,0,4,3 April 2011

","With only a few weeks of school left, two losers are invited to a party being thrown by a girl. They decide not to tell their even more of a loser friend about the party, until he mentions getting a fake I.D. Now they are able to buy booze for the party. The rest of the film follows their antics in trying to get booze and to the party.Superbad was, much like Snakes On A Plane, a much hyped film on the internet. A red band trailer (uncensored) played on the internet and people left right and centre thought it was hilarious. With the success of Knocked Up, another Apatow production, Superbad looked to be not only a hilarious film, but a financially successful one as well. Now that the film has arrived, it seems to have lived up to that hype and better both 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up.While I haven't seen Knocked Up yet, I stated that the 40 Year Old Virgin was the funniest movie of the last couple years and now you can put Superbad right beside it. With the comedic writing style of Seth Rogen, who also has a starring role and Apatow as the producer it was hard for this film to fail, considering the current high ride these guys are on right now. Add to the mix Jonah Hill and Michael Cera as two unknown leads with comedic style just waiting to be seen and you have one funny movie.Hill's fast pace comedic style reminds me of Vince Vaughn and he fits perfectly here in the Apatow crew. Cera's comedy style is clearly in his actions and awkward pauses. Any fan of Arrested Development can see the same style here, which plays off very well with Hill's fast style. The third wheel Fogal, played pitch perfectly by Christpoher Mintz-Plasse, has a style that we've seen before, but taken to another level. Yes, he's a nerd that even nerds find nerdy, but Plasse takes that role and made it his own. It makes one think if they wrote it like that, or he simply took it over. Both Rogen and Hader play the not too old to party police officers who take Fogal, who's actually best known as McLovin, for a ride. With the trailer playing it up big on these two guys and the whole McLovin joke, one would expect it to run it's course fairly early. Yet these three make it fresh and funny with each scene.While it is certainly not original by any means, it earns points for taking a tired genre (highschool kids wanting to get laid and drink booze) and make it relatable to all generations. Something that films from the 80's can't do with kids these days, but Superbad is able to do with the older crowd. It may be the whole retro feel the film has to it, from it's party styles to the clothes our two characters wear.While Hill get's most of the good lines, Cera is the one who gets most of the laughs. His awkward sex moment plays as one of the funniest scenes. It's weird that they are both out-shined by Plasse. Who gets a little too excited in one scene when he has a boner. While both leads have had small fame before hand, with Cera on the hilarious Arrested Development and Hill as 'the fat guy' from recent comedies; it's easy to see this film as their breakthrough roles.Much like Virgin, and I'm assuming Knocked Up, Superbad has a message. Yes, in this raunchy vulgar comedy there is a message about being yourselves and letting some things go in life. You can see these messages coming from the start, but that doesn't effect the film in any way.There are too many moments of hilarity to pick just one. Whether it's Cera awkward singing or Hill's leg being used as a tampon, every scene is just as funny as the one before. The comedy doesn't really let up and is consistent all throughout. With Virgin running a bit too long and Wedding Crashers third act failing horribly, it's hard for comedies to stay consistently funny these days. Superbad doesn't have this problem and if you're a fan of the comedies I mentioned earlier, this film will not disappoint.",8,1,6,23 August 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Better Than I Thought It Was Going To Be
","This is the origins story of the mutant known as Wolverine and how he was attached to the weapon x project.When I first heard they were going to make this flick, I thought that the series was going to go into a nosedive. The third film in the X-men franchise lacked everything that made the first two films enjoyable. Now a spin-off? I wasn't having it and the fact that they seemed to ruin one of my favourite x-men characters in the trailers didn't seem to help either. Well, I can say this, the film is not that bad. It's actually decent and a step up from the horrid Last Stand. Although they do miss a few steps that really hurt the film as a whole.First off Hugh Jackman was born to play this character, here he is given more room to dive deeper into the animal and he does a great job. Mixing both comedic and dramatic elements, there is nothing new here to the character, just more of the same. More of the same though is fun and kick ass. Liev Schreiber plays Victor Creed, aka Sabretooth. His look is different from the first time we see him and he actually has some speaking lines here. Excellent casting choice, Liev really lets go here and you can see the fun he is having with the character.Now, onto the two things that are ruined, from a 'fan' perspective. Deadpool and Gambit. Many fans knew going in that these two guys were both kick ass and that the film was not going to do them justice. Well, it's true. These two guys lacked the screen time and the badass personas that people have come to love. Ryan Reynold has 5 minutes of screen time, he does he usual jokey bits like in Blade Trinity, but here it fits for the character. We see one scene in which he uses his blades to deflect bullets, quite cool. Then he is gone for the rest of the film. Gambit shows up 3/4 of the way through and is horribly underused. Why is he in here again? His scenes lacked a lot of punch it seems that his character was only used to draw in fans. The character in the film could have been anybody else and it wouldn't effect the story, but they chose Gambit cause fans wanted to see him. You will be disappointed.The final fight sequences is interesting, I don't want to go into details cause that would give away certain plot points, specifically who the final fight scene is with and why he is fighting him. I have to raise another complaint though, as for the explanation for Wolverine's so called memory loss. They don't explain it very well in the film, they just say that this will make him not remember. Why? I don't know. Fighting fire with fire just doesn't make sense to me. The explanation for his memory loss is truly pathetic and doesn't make any sense. There are cameos from a lot of mutants, cyclops as a kid is one and another one at the end that fans will enjoy. I thought that they could have trimmed the running time down a bit, currently 1hr46min. Subplots don't really work in this film, I'm talking about his love interest. A lazy way to try and drive the plot forward.The action sequences range from enjoyable to laughable. The opening credit sequences is neat and mirrors what Watchmen did.Fans will most likely be disappointed by the lack of respect this 'origin' story deserved. It's leaps and bounds over the last film, but that's not really saying much. The special effects are the worst in the entire series, which is a huge let knock against it because it's almost ten years after the original.",6,33,68,18 April 2009
Hot Fuzz," By The Power Of Greyskull, This Is A Funny Movie!!!
","Nick Angel is the top cop in London, with arrests that are 400% higher then anyone else in his department. This doesn't look so good for everyone else, so the decision to ship him off to a small village is made. Angel arrives and finds it difficult to cope with the lack of real crime and the lack of policing in the village. Not until bodies begin to pile high does Nick suspect something sinister is up and about and he goes an and action rampage trying to solve this mystery.If the names Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright sound vaguely familiar to you, then you've probably seen the overly funny 'Shaun of the Dead'. After the release of that film, it became an instant cult classic that ran a thin line between comedy, romance and horror. Now these guys are at it again, this time in the buddy cop action genre. It's safe to say they've knocked it out of the park, yet again. It's refreshing seeing talent delve into more then one specific genre, which can only mean bigger and greater things in the future.Hot Fuzz does for action films what Shaun of the Dead did for horror. Bring a unique comedic style and touch to a genre that has been done to death and somehow manage to pull off a great film. Just like Shaun, Fuzz has the same actors making an appearance, where some are in cameo roles like Bill Nighy as the Chief Inspector, right down to the two main stars themselves; Pegg and Frost, who are a perfect comedic pair together. Much to my surprise there were two more cameos, I don't want to give them away, but look closely at the Santa Clause who stabs Nick and his masked girlfriend.From the beginning of the film you can tell that Wright is behind the camera. The quick action cuts of every little thing (from taking your jacket off to putting your keys in the door) is done in such a fast paced way and so often, that it has somehow become his 'trademark', much like Tarantino with his trunk shot or Scorsese using Gimme Shelter. In Shaun this was used a couple of times, but here it's in almost every scene, yet it somehow compliments the film. When you're homaging and parodying action films, everything should be exaggerated, tightly shot and quickly edited. Even the small things like grabbing the telephone is done in an 'action film' style.For film buffs, it's neat to pick out the references to other films, that are literally scattered throughout Fuzz. If it's not blatant and in your face like Point Break or Straw Dogs, it's subtle and only spoken. 'Forget it Nick, It's Sandford'. Obvious reference to Chinatown. The reference range from genre to genre. Horror and action films are the main targets, and it's hard not to crack a smile when the final fight scene reminds you of Lethal Weapon.The townsfolk all play their parts well, with James Bond himself, Dalton, standing out as the devilish supermarket boss. Seeing these townsfolk being so ordinary and timid make for the climax of this film even more enjoyable. The climax itself is the entire third act of the film, which is where most of the laughs are, which is unfortunate. Unlike Shaun, that kept the laughs consistent, Fuzz goes on and off. In the scenes where the laughter is off it tends to drag on a little. This hurts the film cause these scenes could have been cut, making the film shorter and having more of an impact on the viewer. After a slow start, and a off and on funny scenes for the body of the film, it takes something special in the final act to bring the movie into greatness. Hot Fuzz has this and more in it's gun blazing, car chasing, blood splattering, third act.It's quite right to say that Wright and co. brought their horror specialties to Fuzz, as so many scenes seem like they could have been brought right out of a horror film. All of the deaths are bloody and jaw dropping; as in I did not expect it to be so graphic in this style of film. Fuzz has a hint of Shaun at every corner and of course every other buddy cop movie as well. It's horror aspect played well throughout the film, paying off in the end and of course making another reference to a well known horror film that has it's own cult following.Pegg takes a drastic turn in this film, from playing a loser that's afraid of everything to a bad ass with impressive sharp shooting schools. With Frost playing the same type of buddy sidekick with a thick skull. This time though, Frost manages to pull off some kind of pity feeling for the character. You feel sorry for him, but you don't know why. Maybe because he looks up to Angel so many times and acts like a big gorilla.In the end, Hot Fuzz indeed delivers the laughs and the action, which is all saved for the third act. It doesn't reach the greatness of Shaun, but it manages to separate itself from it and for that I can recommend it. It will drag on for some, but others will have a fun time picking out all the references to other films. Enjoy the film for what it is, a funny look on the action genre. With more then enough people and car flying in the air in slow motion from 4 or 5 different angles to please Bay fans. Fuzz is definitely worth checking out.",8,3,6,22 April 2007
Spotlight," 'If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it.'
","If someone were to sit me down and ask me what my most anticipated films of 2015 were. I would say that Mad Max was it, beginning and end of list. Then I saw a trailer for a film called Spotlight. My list immediately grew to two. A new editor-in-chief from Miami comes to work at the Boston Globe. His first big action while there is to question why no one has investigated the claims of a priest molesting kids. After some pushback, he finally decides to hand it to 'Spotlight', a team of four journalists who tackle in depth investigative projects. They make it their mission to expose not only the disgraceful actions of a few priests in their neighbourhood, but the system that tried to cover it all up. For some reason, films that deal with newsprint appeals to me. I don't get why, they just do. One of the more underrated films that falls into this category, is coincidentally another Keaton film, The Paper. Maybe I had that in the back of my mind when I decided I needed to see this film, but I'm glad I saw it because it deserves to be seen. Spotlight isn't afraid to tackle a serious and touchy subject matter and it does so with careful precision and thought. What makes the film relatable is that is never leaves the current situation of the neighbourhood. We see the story through the eyes of the journalists and the streets of that neighbourhood. We don't get these grand aerial shots of the city of Boston, because we are confined to the horrors that live on those neighbourhood streets. Spotlight isn't a showy film, save for one scene; it's mostly static shots of people talking. Yet I was glued to the screen.One of the biggest things going for Spotlight is how well the cast works together. There are some heavy hitters here: Michael Keaton, straight off his career high with Birdman, delivers another knockout performance of Spotlight team leader Walter Robinson. The real Robinson would go on to say that it feels as is Keaton has 'stolen his identity, that's how weird it was to watch him become me'. Mark Ruffalo is reporter Michael Rezendes, who goes to great lengths to make sure the story is told, no matter what the consequences are to them. Ruffalo has the grandiose scene where he breaks down about wanting to print the story immediately, but is being told no. He conveys the right amount of emotion without going over the top. The lone female of the group, Sacha Pfeiffer is played by Rachel McAdams. She is able to hold her own against more heavyweights and has one of the most uncomfortable scenes in the entire film when she confronts a priest who admits that he molested children, but sees no wrongdoings in it. That scene in the film took place in real life. I could go on and on about how excellent the cast is here, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci are all excellent, with Tucci having the more underrated performance of the film. He's a lawyer trying to fight the good fight, being the voice of the victims, when others looked away. He has a line that he delivers to Ruffalo about being an outsider, which strikes everything home. I did find myself being a little emotional towards the end of the film. There are some emotional moments scattered throughout, specifically one involving victims recounting the abuse. Spotlight is a magnificently crafted film that soars due to the cast and the horrific nature of the content. Seeing the names of the cities at the end of the film left me in shock as to how close some of them are to me. One of the best of the year.",8,1,2,9 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," Sequel...Prequel....Reboot...Whatever
","The problem with this film is the same problem that the recent Wolverine film had, it just doesn't connect with the original material. Now, there could be many reasons for this, non of which the film acknowledges. In fact, the film doesn't seem to care about a lot of stuff other then blowing things up and making it look cool. This entry into the series is vastly different from the previous ones. This time around the story takes place in 'present time' I would say, since every film before that was about traveling back in time to save/kill whomever. So right off the bat the film feels like it doesn't belong.Terminator Salvation is better then Rise of the Machines and weaker then the first two. There, I just told you something you probably already knew. Christian Bale is the 4th actor to portray John Conner (that's right 4th, look it up) and his performance consists of a lot of yelling and shooting. He doesn't have any scenes of emotional depth and the character loses that connectivity with the earlier films. He's a different John Connor, he's not the punk kid or the hiding from everything bum, he's finally becoming what his mother said he would be. Although, he is not the leader of the resistance yet, so this film is NOT the battles we've been preluded to in the original films, it's what happens before it. This film takes place in 2018, everything we've seen or been told came from 2029.The rest of the cast, with the exception of the saving grace that is Sam Worthington, is pretty much useless. Common fades into the background and serves no purpose whatsoever, he could have been just another faceless soldier. Moon Bloodgood seems to have gotten all her scenes left on the cutting room floor. She has a romance with Worthington that comes out of nowhere because prior scenes were obviously deleted. This makes her actions seem unrealistic. Bryce Dallas Howard takes over the Claire Danes role and surprise surprise is giving nothing to do as well. Anton Yelchin surprised me as Kyle Reese, and seemed like a believable 'young' Biehn. The man who steals the show is Sam Worthington, who is actually given some emotions to play with. I found myself interested in his character and his scenes the most in this film.McG has an eye for visuals, yet all his films lack substance. This is no different. Although I will say this is his best film, but when looking at his resume, that doesn't amount to much. Whatever substance this film has, it was given to by previous films. The script is basic go to point A to get plot point B. The only worthy addition to this story is the role of Marcus (Worthington) who actually brings a new dimension to this story, which in my opinion, we already know how it will turn out. I'm not totally sure on how this film stands on the whole timeline issue, but in my opinion, none of the key characters were ever at risk to me. Kyle Reese we know will go back in time, so he must live to do so. We know John Conner lives till 2029 to send Reese back in time, so we have no sense of danger in their scenes. Of course it could all be different and they could indeed die, I'm saying this based on the one line of him saying 'This is not the future my mother warned me about'.It will satisfy the action junkies, but leave those who want to see a continuance of the story empty. The barren wastelands are nice to see and gives them free roam for many neat things, such as car chases, motorcycle chases, air jet chases, etc. It had a bit more Mad Max then Terminator feel. You'll see a surprise cameo, which means only one thing when someone says that about this franchise, but when you see it you might laugh. We haven't perfected this yet and it looks fake and cheesy.Terminator Salvation is a popcorn flick that takes the series in a new direction. No more time traveling to save people, now it's the fight to stay alive. This new direction might not sit well with some, but for those just looking to enjoy themselves for a solid action film, this delivers. The scenes are exciting and Worthington delivers what others should have. The ending is a bit ridiculous, but it's better then the rumoured ending with the skin swapping. On a final note, Connor mentions that he's never seen anything like Marcus before, a machine covered in human skin with organs. Yet, he HAS seen this before, maybe not the organs, but he acts like this is brand new to him. Just one plot hole in my mind, in a field of many.",6,4,8,21 May 2009
Juno," Jason Reitman scores with another comedy - one of the year's best.
","Juno is a 16 year old girl who one day discovers she is pregnant. First she wants an abortion, but then soon realizes she would rather have the baby and give it to a family in need of one.When Thank You For Smoking came out it was the biggest surprise of the year. A dark comedy that wasn't afraid to give it straight. Confident directing lead a strong cast. This year, Jason Reitman is at it again with Juno, a heart-warming comedy that...again, tells it like it is. This time we follow a young girl, played strongly by Ellen Page as she faces the world with a bun in the oven. Juno is not your typical teenage girl, she can't even classify herself in one niche. Page brings a heart-warming and grounded performance that comes off as strong, yet vulnerable at the same time. She is supported by Michael Cera, her goofy best friend, who is also the father of her baby. Cera again plays the character of George Michael. We also saw this same character in Superbad earlier this year. It's not a bad thing, Cera has the awkward comedy timing down pat, but he needs to break out of that character and move on to bigger things.Her father, J.K Simmons and step-mother Allison Janney support Juno through her hard time. Both seem more eager to help Juno through this, then to throw her through a wall, which is what would normally happen in other flicks. Janney takes her to her ultra-sound test and defends her when her teenage motherhood is brought into question, Simmons accompanies her to the adoptive parents house, to make sure she isn't taken advantage of. The adoptive parents are Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman. An odd pairing if you ask me, but both play their characters very well because it suits them as so. Bateman is a man trying to get back his youth, while Garner is desperately in need of a child to call her own. While it is odd to see the two paired together, they work very well when they are apart.Jason Reitman shows us that he is not simply a one trick pony. With the success of his first feature 'Thank You For Smoking' and this year's 'Juno', Reitman is on the fast track to becoming the hot new thing in Hollywood. His care and attention for the film is apparent throughout. Juno at the abortion clinic is so paranoid and on nerve that she freaks out at the smallest things, which happen to be the little things people are doing around her, like scratching their arm or biting their nails. The emphasis of the sound on these small insignificant things, make them significant. His care for these characters that were created by Diablo Cody is from the heart. These people are every day people, with everyday problems. He knows this and shows this. Being pregnant isn't Juno's only problem, she has to deal with the people in her life who can't seem to find love. She needs reassurance that there is love out there.The screenplay at first seems to be trying too hard to be smart and funny, but once it gets over itself, it becomes just that. The dialogue is quick and funny and said with ease from the actors. The story is simple and charming, yet feels complicated and depressing. Juno knows what she wants, but the world seems to be crashing down when things don't go her way. The amount of care put into these character are enormous, they are not here to simply tell a story, there are here to be the story.The one fault is not from a writing standpoint, or technical or even from the acting. It's more personal. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that the film take a small detour from it's warm hearted comedy and goes into some depressing serious scenes. It didn't work too well for me. Although it is believable and contributes to the story, I felt that it would have been better if it had left that part out and taken a different turn.Juno is this years 'Little Miss Sunshine'. Full of heart and charm and will entertain you to no end. It has a great soundtrack to boot. The music fits the film perfectly with mood and story. When 2007 saw pirates, ogres and superheroes flying around, all it took was a 16 year old girl to win our hearts and our attention.",8,3,12,28 December 2007
X-Men," The comic book film that re-started this generation.
","Mutants are feared and hated, they have special abilities that humans don't. Magneto is a mutant who believes a war is brewing between mutants and mankind, so he sets out to turn everyone into a mutant. Professor Xavier and his team of X-Men believe mankind is good and can live peacefully with mutants, they must stop him.There have been many comic book films before X-Men, the most notable ones are Superman and Batman, yet there have even been lesser known comic book characters getting their big screen debut before the mutants. Tank Girl, Blade and The Crow all got their chance and they did pretty well (well, maybe not tank girl) but I think it was X-Men that kick started this wave of comic book films that we have today. 2 years later we got Spider-Man and then every other film coming out was based on a comic book. X-Men, ten years later, still remains to be one of the better adaptations.The key role in the success of this film was the casting choices. Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier is not only a stroke of genius, but the most obvious choice. Newcomer Hugh Jackman gives us a dead on portrayal of Logan aka Wolverine and since this film has become a superstar in Hollywood, even getting his own film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Ian McKellen plays the villain Magneto and even though his physical appears make him appear fragile, his use of speech and demeanor make him terrifying in a unique way, you believe that he is as dangerous as they say. Being a big fan of the comics, I was anticipating this film with a big smile on my face. I liked it then and as I mentioned earlier, it still holds up today. There are some shoddy special effects that jump out at you more now than ever, but as a whole, this comic book adaptation hits the right notes. Bryan Singer uses homosexuality as a comparing theme for mutants. Being a homosexual himself, he seemed to be able to portray the issues of separation and isolation that mutants feel. This is further explored in the sequel.I can help but feel that by the film's conclusion, they could have gone a little bigger. The conflict between Sabretooth and Wolverine is not as engaging as a fan of the comics would want and the changing of Rogue into the Jubliee character from the animated series might rub some people the wrong way. Sabretooth is not as vicious as he could be and Rogue is an annoying teenage girl. X-Men is a good film that is shy of being great. Everything that was mishandled here was made right in the sequel. X-Men proved that comic book films can be smart and not just for fans/geeks who collect comics.",7,0,1,26 June 2010
Spider-Man 3," Spidey Is Back In Black, Third Installment Is For Fans Of The Films, Not The Comics.
","In my review of X3, I faulted it for it's inconsistency with the comics. It would be unfair if I didn't do the same for Spiderman 3. Sam Raimi and co are back in this third installment of the mega box office franchise and have tweaked the comics a bit to create more of an emotional impact on the viewer. Unfortunately any emotional scene is ruined by the cheese factor that emits from the screen. When characters try to be heartfelt, bits of laughter came out of the theatre. Spidey is indeed back, this time in black. It will definitely please fans of the films, but comic lovers may end up disappointed when the credits begin to roll.I had high hopes for this film, could the rumours of Venom being in it be true? Could my geek fanboy dreams be true? Then more and more people popped up and I thought, can they pull this off? Can they fit in Harry's revenge, The Sandman, Venom, Dark Spidey and Gwen Stacey all into one film that won't run over three hours? Raimi tried his best to give each segment enough screen time to resolve itself by the final scene, but it all proves too much for him to handle.Let me get my fanboy nitpicks out of the way first. Venom is, in my honest opinion, ruined in this film. Raimi was hesitant in putting this villain into the film and it shows, he seems like a last ditch effort to get more people in the seats. Something they created in post-production to get more word of mouth circling. Was the Sandman not enough? Venom came and went quicker then Jon Lovitz career. Most of the time it's Eddie Brock's face rather then the creature Venom. This isn't what the fans wanted. Secondly, we all know that Flint Marko (Sandman) did not kill Ben Parker, here he did. Reason for this change? To make him seem more important then he actually is. They took a cool character, played well by Church, in the small screen time he does have, and made him boring, non threatening, and ultimately not as cool as previous villains, like Doc Ock. Any emotional impact that Raimi was aiming for is ruined by the shoddy acting and cheesy dialogue. Then Gwen Stacey, but let me stop there. Again, fanboy nitpicks.Back to the film. There is way too much going on for anything to have significant screen time. The fight sequences with the Sandman never reach the level of excitement when Spidey was fighting Dock Ock and it's quick fighting scenes interwoven with the slow dialogue spoken by almost everyone makes for some awkward pacing. Spiderman and the Dark Costume is too much to be stuff into as a sub plot. They did a decent job of handling it, but it could have been so much more. None of the villains ever really seemed threatening. If Venom had more screen time he could have been more of a threat.There is next to no chemistry with Dunst and Maguire this time around. This could have been done on purpose, but it really ruined the believability that these two are lovers. If it weren't for the first two films would we ever guess they were together? Franco's role here is an awkward one. Here is not menacing at all, and his scenes with him having no memory come off comedic and inappropriate. Also Maguire turns emo on the us when he's suppose to be 'bad' Seems like a lot of bad stuff went wrong in this film, but that's not really true. All in all I enjoyed this film. It was a good addition to the series. Better then the first film and only falling a hair short of the second. With more emphasis on the villains and what the substance from the meteorite was, this film could have easily been the best comic book film ever. So what was good about it your asking? Well, everything else.Watch out for those cameos, Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell both make an appearance and both received applause from the audience. Campbell who's scene here is the funniest out of all three films is the comedic highlight. I always have a smile on my face when he graces the screen. Speaking of comedy, this film has a lot of it, some intentional some not. Parker pulls off a Saturday Night Fever moment half way through the film which is, I can only guess, a reminder of the 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' moment from the second.Special Effects and action sequences are top notch. My favourite action scene is still the Doc Ock train fight, but it's obvious Raimi was trying to top himself here. Everything in this film is on a bigger scope. The action sequences stand out more then the fight sequences. Seeing Spiderman save Gwen from falling, through debris and what not, was a treat. Even if Spiderman decided to save her and not stop the machine (watch film and you'll understand). The fight scenes leading up to the final climatic battle are short, but good nonetheless. Plenty of aerial fights, with both characters falling to the ground while still battling it out. A surprise stand out fight sequence I have to give to Harry VS Spiderman. It was the most ambitious of them all.Is Spiderman 3 a disappointment? Yes and No. I expected a lot more out of it and only got half of it. The half I got was was very pleased with. The film had so much in it, but not enough time for any of it. Raimi's eyes were bigger then his stomach. He wanted bigger and better, all he got was bigger. I can recommend the film as it was entertaining and did it's job on delivering action, but there is that little voice in the back of my head that wanted more.",6,3,8,4 May 2007
Yes Man," It Just Doesn't Get Creative Enough.
","Carl is a loner who never wants to do anything with anyone. This includes his best friend who is about to get married. After missing a few important dates in his friends life and having a bizarre dream about being dead and nobody caring, he decides to attend a YES MAN seminar. He is challenged to say YES to EVERYTHING, or else bad things will happen to him.This kind of sound like Liar Liar and that is the film most people will be comparing it to, even though both of them are almost completely different. The only similarity is that the main character HAS to do something. One is to tell the truth, the other is to say yes. Well, the similarities stop there. I want to say that this film is funny, and I will, but it wasn't funny enough. I got a few chuckles here and there but not one scene stands out in my mind as the funniest or the most memorable. Which is a bad thing for a comedy.Jim Carrey does his usual and brings the funny faces and physical comedy. At some points it seems unnecessary and forced, like when he is having a weird face making competition with his boss. At other times, it just simply works cause it's Jim Carrey and he's being doing it for years. As Carl, who is played by Carrey, soon finds out that saying yes leads to good things in his life, he embraces the idea. Unfortunately that idea is never fully realized and we never really see where this could take us. It felt like they were playing it safe this time, which is really odd considering the amount of adult material in here.There are a few swear words, I remember hearing the F-BOMB a few times, which surprised me. Also there is a scene in which my girlfriend found completely gross and it involves an elderly lady taking out her teeth to 'perform' on Carl. The scene is used to show that when he says NO, bad things happen to him, but at the same time it seems completely like it should belong in another film.Everything you see in the trailer is pretty much what he says yes to. The Korean, the guitar lessons, the plane lessons. There are only a few that you don't know about but they aren't that funny. Driving a homeless man home is one of them and it never got a laugh from me.The supporting cast helps the film immensely. Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as always. I find her always to be charming and cute with a funny side. Carl's boss and new friend due to him having to say yes to everything is Rhys Darby. People may recognize him from the TV show Flight of the Conchords as the band manager. He steals the show in every scene and is far more funny then Jim Carrey. It's a shame because I always liked Jim Carrey. It seems that the older comedians are losing it while the newer ones seem fresh and hot. Terence Stamp has three scenes in the film, two of which are at the seminars. He doesn't really add too much to the film and the role could have been played by anyone.The film is indeed a romantic comedy, so I warn you. Be prepared for every romantic comedy clich√©. This one has them. Boy meets girl, loses girl and races against time to win her back. What makes it not really work is that I can't see Deschanel really hooking up with Carrey. It must be the age gap. Even though these two work well together, I just can't see them romantically involved. Maybe best friends would work better.I wanted more from Yes Man, it could have really done some funny things with it's premise but it plays it safe. I do find the film to be one of Carrey's better ones of late. Fun with Dick & Jane was horrible and let's not even mention The Number 23. Yes Man is a film you want to be able to laugh constantly at, but will only find yourself laughing every now and again. I recommend Yes Man as a rental and nothing to rush to see.",7,1,4,19 December 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Better Than The First, But Still Room For Improvement
","I found the first Hellboy to be incredibly average and anti-climatic. I had some hopes for the sequel, but the trailers made it seem like there was just too much going on. It seems like the film is trying really hard to create this other world in which Del Toro can have his fun, run wild and create some pretty interesting creatures and locals. Hellboy II is exactly this, but I did enjoy it more then the first one.Abe is given more screen time, but his character seemed to irritate me at the end, would he really do what he does? I thought he was smarter then that. Don't tell me he was in love either, I just couldn't really buy that relationship. It seemed forced and used as a device just so that we could get to the battle sequence at the end.Perlman proves again why he is the man to play Hellboy. He has so much fun in this role and it shows. Why these films don't make him a bigger star, I don't know. he has the action role down pat and his comedic bits are great. Sure he doesn't have the face of Tom Cruise, but this guy should be in more movies.The film looks beautiful and it moves at a great pace. The action sequences, while great, don't add up to anything. It really just seems like they go to one location fight, then go to the next to fight. The fault of both this film and the first is that is has the potential to be really great and I know Del Toro can deliver, but on both tries the films have been just decent. Good films that you like, but wouldn't rush out to buy or remember years later.The bad guy, who was also the baddie in Del Toro's other comic book flick Blade II, is the highlight. He is great and I hope to see Goss in more roles as well. Although, in the film there is a point they make about him and his sister and once they show it you know exactly how the film is going to end. The Golden Army could have been in the film a bit more, but that's just a minor complaint. It seemed like the film's climax wasn't really the biggest battle. The Nature Creature (which reminded me of Cloverfield) seemed to pose more of a threat and the film couldn't jump over that hurdle, which came mid way through the film.To wrap it up, this film improves on some things from the original, but not so much to make me really adore it. I can recommend it because it's fairly entertaining and does a good job at pleasing the fans. I'm hoping the next film, they pull out all the stops and really wow us. The potential is there, they just need to see it.PS: Extra points for that final shot though.",7,1,2,1 July 2009
Cloverfield," An Experiment In Film-making Indeed.
","Rob is about to go away to Japan for a new job, so his friends decide to throw him a good-bye party. The party is quickly disturbed by an earthquake, which is later discovered to be from a giant unknown creature terrorizing the city of New York.To describe this film would be saying what everyone has been saying since its release. Cloverfield is Godzilla meets The Blair Witch Project. This is not a bad thing; to negatives make a positive remember? If it weren't for films like Blair Witch we wouldn't have Cloverfield, then again if it weren't for films like Cannibal Holocaust, we wouldn't have films like Blair Witch. What Cloverfield does is take this idea and spin it on its head. Cloverfield is an experiment in film-making and it is quite successful.Just like Blair Witch the film starts off with a message that this footage was found and we are about to watch this uncut material. For the first 20 or so minutes we get character introductions, these are the people who will be seeing the destruction through; these are the eyes and ears. We don't get much characterization, but enough to know who's who in the grand scheme of things. We see a romantic sub-plot that will no doubt become more important as the film goes on; we meet our cameraman, a sarcastic guy who doesn't have the guts to talk to this one girl, this one girl who is only there to meet up with her other friends later. We also see the main characters brother and girlfriend, but we never get to really know these people. Which is fine, we only get a glimpse into their lives because it's all about the destruction right? The destruction itself is very well done. This is where all the money went. No high tech cameras, just special effects for destruction for New York. Every bit of it was realistic. I was scared this was going to be another monster running around New York bit that Godzilla pulled on us, and yes while it is that, the film is much more. Not once did I ever believe anything in Godzilla, here I was entertain and engaged. I felt like I was actually watching real footage. The unknown actors were a good choice, it adds to the 'found footage' feel.The monster itself is cool looking as well. You never get a full view of it until the very end, but it's the bits and pieces of it that make it scary. Reeves builds up great tension as the monster is roaming the city and we see the destruction from a distance, yet we still have fear that it could kill us.In addition to the giant creature, there are little ones. Apparently they are parasites. They seem like giant spider-crabs to me and they are quite scary. I'm glad that Abrams and crew decided to go with something original and not re-tell Godzilla. This was a brilliant choice and helped the marketing of the film immensely. The sound is sharp and loud. Specifically when the army blasts away at the creature, it makes the viewer feel like they are there.I never once felt sick with the camcorder shaking around everywhere, but others in the theatre were. They were also disappointed with the ending, as half the theatre moaned and asked if that was it. I don't know what they were expecting, maybe some answers? Well you won't get any here. We saw the destruction through the eyes of this camera; we don't know what's going on. The characters don't know what's going on, they speculate that it could be alien, or government secret. There is no scientist with a white lab coat here explaining what the monster is or where it came from. If you're content with this then you'll love this film.Unlike Snakes On A Plane, which I loved by the way, this film lives up to the hype expected by the fans. All the speculations can go to rest Cloverfield is here. Now let new speculations arise.",8,1,4,20 January 2008
Silent Hill," 'I Had A Skin Ripping, Blood Dripping, Body Tearing Good Time'
","Rose takes her daughter to Silent Hill in hopes of finding an answer to her sleep walking nightmares. After a car accident just outside the town, Rose wakes up to see her daughter missing. Now she must roam through the ash dreaded streets of Silent Hill....Silent Hill is based on a video game, one of which I've played, briefly. So I know what I'm in store for, but still didn't expect it. Silent Hill is one of the better horror films of the decade and without a doubt one of the better, if not the best video game adaptation...ever. That's not saying this movie is perfect, it does have it's faults, but the bottom line is that I had a skin ripping, blood dripping, body tearing good time.Silent Hill is beautiful to look at. The cinematography is wonderful, ranging from gray ash ridden streets and buildings, to blood dripping red terrifying nightmares. The film jumps back and fourth between the two eerie scenery and manages to make you feel the eerie weirdness and confusion that our main character, Rose goes through. Rose's husband, Sean Bean, goes through the same town, but in a different state...he's world is grounded and realistic.Is Silent Hill terrifying? Yes and no. It depends on what you've been exposed to in previous films. For me, I love the horror genre, so I've seen it all. Silent Hill wasn't anything to shake me to my bones, but it does a very good job and being creepy. One of the best parts of the movie is the siren. It blares a warning sound when the town turns into the nightmare. You hear it for the first time and you know that nothing good can come of it. You hear it a second time and you are terrified, knowing what will come, but not knowing what to really expect. The third time, you just say to yourself that the characters better get the hell out of there. There are three worlds in Silent Hill. The 'real' world, in which Sean Bean is looking for his wife and daughter. The 'Limbo' world, which is when the town is covered is ashes creating the foggy creepy feeling, then finally, with the siren alarm comes the nightmare world, where we meet all the insane, brutal, pyramid head nightmares. The Pyramid Head guy, if you've played the games you know who I'm talking about, if not...he a guy with a giant pyramid on his head...you think it's funny? Wait till you meet the guy, you might sh*t your pants. He carries a big sword, and can rip the skin of a human in one second flat. The little time he is on the screen, you hide behind those fingers of yours, peeking every once in a while to see if the nightmare is over.There is one scene that is a pure 'Evil Dead' moment. In the original 'Evil Dead' one of the characters gets raped by a tree, here it does that same scene, only upping the terror and cringe worthiness. Think...barbwire. Is there gore? Well, let see, there is the one scene that I just described, in which the body is then ripped in half. Pyramid Head...you remember him, well he rips the skin off a human body. A woman is beaten to near death with blunt instruments, then burned alive. The burning of the woman is kind of pointless. She is repeatedly beaten, to the point where we think she is dead. But, oh no, she is still alive. Can she be saved in time? We think so, otherwise why is she still alive, but then she is burned alive. Reason, for shock value. Pointless.What hurts this film is the useless character of the father, it's need to explain everything and the corny dialogue. While we're in Silent Hill, we should always be in Silent Hill. You take away from the suspense when we have to follow the father and his searching for the two. It takes away from the mystery of what's going on. The audience should be lost with it's main character, there should be no connection to the outside world when you're in Silent Hill. That would ultimately make it more terrifying. Which leads me into it's second fault, which seems to be a trend in many movies. The need to explain why. Why do we always have to have an explanation of why bad things have happened. Why can't it all be a mystery, they're there for our imagination to come up with a reason, not because of what you're telling us. Granted the way they told us was different and nice to see, it's still hurting the film in the end. The dialogue is laughable, is it because it's based on a video game? No, video games can have good dialogue, this film has teen slasher dialogue written all over it. Scream names here in hope to find an individual. Lines like, 'Hey, look at this' or 'No, you're the sinner'. Stuff that should be in a cheesy B-horror movie film that came from the 80's. In this movie it is just out of place. Everything is great in the film, except for the dialogue.The ending does many things, leave you to come up with an explanation and lean into a possible sequel. What I took from the ending? Rose is still in the 'Limbo' world. Her daughter has been for a lack of a better word, possessed by the demon. Which is why she has a different look at the end, the look that a kid such a Damien would give us. The way it's presented to us can confuse the audience, but I liked it. Silent Hill, for the hardcore fans, I think will please. For horror fans, will please. Silent Hill is a genuine terrifying experience.",8,1,3,28 April 2006
The Hateful Eight," 'One of them fellas is not what he says he is...'
","After a leaked script of Tarantino's next project, The Hateful Eight, he swore that he would not film it. Instead he did a live read and it got a lot of applause. This apparently gave him enough reason to shoot the film anyway...and in 70mm no less. With The Hateful Eight, Tarantino finally steps out of the revenge theme that has steered his career since Kill Bill. This is a welcomed change of pace, but he still succumbs to things that plague his recent output of films, mainly self indulgence and a lengthy running time. A bounty hunter is travelling to Red Rock with his bounty, a woman by the name of Daisy. Along the way he encounters two men stuck in a blizzard and unenthusiastically gives them a lift. They reach shelter where there are other men shielding themselves from the freezing cold. Yet something seems odd, are these men really who they say they are? Is one of them lying? Will anyone make it out of this cabin alive? For the first time since Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino dives back into a little bit of mystery. In Reservoir Dogs, someone was a cop, here, we have no idea what it going on or who is who. This perfectly amps of the tension and in typical Tarantino fashion, he lets us stew in it for a really long time. It's not a Tarantino movie if there is not a long winded, yet well written and cool monologue that will undoubtedly end in blood shed. This film delivers that in spades as the blood does indeed shed and everyone has their chance to give a few quips here and there. One thing Tarantino always seems to hit the nail on the head with is his casting. This film is no exception. Kurt Russell, Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Bruce Dern and Demian Bichir all play their roles perfectly well in this slow burner that feels more like a stage play than a film shot in 70mm. Tim Roth's character reminds me so much of a role that Christoph Waltz would play that it was hard NOT seeing Waltz in this film. Roth stands out in the crowd with a more exuberant character in line with Waltz's Dr. Schultz. Leigh is also on the bit eccentric side and deservedly should be recognized come awards season. Always being a fan of Kurt Russell it's nice to see him back in the Tarantino fold after Death Proof, which Russell was the best thing. Goggins is also a stand out, but if you've followed him enough than you'll know that this is not a surprise. He's always one of the best things about whatever he is in. Dern and Madsen aren't really given too much to do and Madsen in particular seems to be on auto-pilot. Not that the man gives great performances, but Tarantino usually gets a bit more out of his actors. The opening shots of the winter landscape look glorious, of course. Then we are subjected to interior shots of people talking for almost the rest of the film. Which makes one wonder why bother shooting or even seeing this in 70mm. Tarantino has said that after he's done making movies he'd want to direct a stage play. So far, this is the closest he's gotten to it. Most of this film is merely interactions between people within a log cabin. The interactions are wonderful and show us the talent of Tarantino and those on the screen. Even at 2 hours and 47 minutes, the film never really feels like it drags in any parts. That was the biggest surprise to me. I felt engaged the entire time. Maybe on repeat viewings this will die down a bit, since most of the tension and suspense will be gone, but imagine the basement bar scene with Fassbender from Inglorious Basterds, only extended to a feature length film. There are two sequences that took me out of the film and it's one thing that happens twice. Tarantino did the same thing with Inglorious Basterds, where random narration pops in to tell us exactly what we are seeing on the screen. Adding insult to injury...it's Tarantino himself narrating the events on the screen. I was confused more than anything. Why include this bit of storytelling randomly? If you want narration, give it at the start, not two random scenes, it makes no sense. Tarantino falls back on his chapter storytelling element here. Much like Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds, the film is split up into chapters with scene headings. Also, like his other films it also includes flashbacks, this has become a staple in his films and I feel like his uses the same font every damn time. Again, like Django Unchained, the film contains a lot of racist remarks from the characters casually throwing around the n-word. Something that has become too common in his films. Small quibbles aside, The Hateful Eight is exactly what one would expect from Tarantino. It's violent, it's talkative and packs one hell of a cast. Hateful Eight finds itself in the middle road in Tarantino's resume, it's nowhere near his best, nor his worst.",7,6,28,21 December 2015
Moana," You're Welcome.
","2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.Legend has it that demigod Maui stole a sacred stone, the heart of the goddess Te Fiti. The lava demon confronted him and both the heart and Maui were lost forever. Now, the world is slowly dying and someone must find the heart and force Maui to put it back. But who is this chosen one? It might be Moana, a Polynesian girl who is suppose to be taking over as chief of her tribe, but longs to sail beyond the reef. Featuring new comer Auli'i Carvalho as Moana and the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, as the demigod Maui. It's not surprising that I found myself tapping my feet to the songs in this film because Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of Hamilton, shares his talent with this film. I can easily see any one of the songs in this piece going up for and winning Best Original Song, giving the man the O in the prestigious PEGOT award circle. He currently has a Pulitzer, Emmy, Tony and Grammy, among more. The songs here remind me of the old-school Disney songs, easy to listen to, fun to play on repeat and important to the story. At first, I felt it was a little too on the nose with some of the lyrics, but eventually he won me over and I've been listening to the soundtrack ever since. The film itself might lack some of the intricacies of plot heavy films like Zootopia, but this journey story is entertaining and heartfelt. The vibrant colours of the green islands and the blue sea help propel the film above and beyond what some others films have to offer. The animation takes a nice little turn for the creative when the characters find themselves under the sea in a side villains lair. We are treated with some bioluminescent sequences with another catchy tune not far behind. Johnson is stellar as Maui, he seems completely comfortable in a voice acting role and surprisingly has the chops to sing a tune. Newcomer Auli'i Carvalho holds her own against a star like Johnson and she really gives a strong voice to a driven female character. I applaud that Disney didn't feel the need to shoehorn in a love story either. This is a tale about self discovery, not some young woman needing to find a man. Disney nods and respects their past while looking to the future with Moana. Princesses no longer need to be the 'love' goal of a man. Moana is a visually beautiful film with great songs and a strong female lead character. There are some visually gags for the kids and a great time for adults. Moana is a great film.",8,81,132,3 January 2017
Crash," 'A Great Ensemble Cast Delivers'
","Several stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles involving a collection of inter-related characters. A black police detective with a drugged out mother and a thieving younger brother, two car thieves who are constantly theorizing on society and race, the distracted district attorney and his irritated and pampered wife, a racist veteran cop (caring for a sick father at home) who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner, a successful black Hollywood director and his wife who must deal with racist cop, a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop, a Hispanic locksmith and his young daughter who is afraid of bullets, and more.Paul Haggis won an Oscar for his work on the Best Picture winner 'Million Dollar Baby'. While 'Baby' itself doesn't deserve the praise that it is given, the writing did. Here Haggis gives us another piece of work that will have some in tears and others filled with rage at the morals of society.Crash's core theme is that of racism and how it is destroying today's society. Crash tries to get the point across that this prejudice is destroying our ways of communication with each other. The film uses L.A. as it's setting to show us that virtually anyone and everyone can be racist. Which is where Crash faults. Although the film does deal with this theme, about 95% of the characters are racist and uses almost every stereotype to showcase the problems in society.With those two missteps aside, Crash is a film that delivers everything that is promises to. Brilliant writing, good directing and a cast ensemble that gives us great performances. Paul Haggis wrote characters that had problems and he knew exactly how to present them to us and how to deal with them. Many directors who write the material have a hard time trying to abstract the material to screen. David S. Goyer failed at this with Blade Trinity, but here Haggis has enough experience to know what he wants from his actors and in what direction he wants to take them.Out of all the performances in this picture the select few that would stand out would be the racist cop, played by Matt Dillion. The successful black director, played by Terrance Howard and the racist wife of the district attorney played by Sandra Bullock. Dillion shows that his character is an egotistical selfish prick, but in the end, we end of not hating him, but feeling sorrow for him. He has the trouble of taking care of a sick father and finally puts the life of an individual before the colour of their skin. Terrance Howard gives a performance that is just as good as his portrayal of a pimp in Hustle and Flow. Howard is able to convey so much emotion through his eyes. Finally Bullock plays a character that is radically different from anything that she has done before and is able to convince us of her fear and hate towards those that are of a different race.Crash delivers lots of moments of tension and fear for the lives of the characters. I was glued to the screen when the little girl put her 'invisbile cape' to the test. All the characters effect the lives of each other whether they know it or not and it all fits together perfectly well. Crash is one of the few movies this year to give us a powerful message.With a talent writer behind the pen and knowing what he wants in this film, he is able to give us a great film. Along with one of the best cast ensembles to grace the screen since the likes of True Romance. Crash gives us a movie that will make us cry, laugh and feel anger towards. Not many movies these days are able to do this, but Crash makes it work beautifully.",8,1,5,17 November 2005
The Expendables," The Expendables falls short on expectations.
","A team of mercenaries head to an island to overthrow a dictator. The entire plot of the film can be summed up in 12 words. Even less if I try. Merc overthrow dictator. There, only 3. I was somewhat excited to see The Expendables, Stallone having a throwback action film, with a cast that had jaws drop everywhere when it was announced. The sad part is, the film falls short in many areas and just meets expectations in others. For a film like this, I wanted to be engulfed in everything it had to offer, I wasn't. The film stands out in the pile of films that hit theatres this year about a group of skilled guys with guns who have to kill people. The Losers, The A-Team and most recently RED. The difference is that each one of those was based on something prior. Be it a graphic novel or TV show, and they had a bit of revenge thrown in. The Expendables is simply about guys kicking ass. I appreciate Stallone for doing what he set out to do. He made a guy flick, with muscles, guns, knives, one liners and explosions. Yet, the film was still missing something, it had no heart.Here we have a great cast, yet everyone is underused. Especially Dolph 'Drago' Lundgren, it's almost criminal. With a cast like this you would expect everyone to get their moment to shine and have a kick ass part in the film. Jet Li does his martial arts thing, which we have seen before. Statham and Stallone are the only two characters the script pays attention to, everyone else is left to the wayside. Randy Courture and Terry Crews seem like after thoughts in this cast of characters. Stallone, you can't expect to give one character a big loud gun and expect everyone to forgive you by thinking he had a purpose. Mickey Rourke shows up, looking like he walked right off the set of Iron Man 2. His role is strictly dialogue and apparently gives Stallone a reason to go back to the island and save a girl. Cordelia Chase or Charisma Carpenter, as her real name is, has two scenes. Both of them are a poor attempt at giving Statham some kind of backstory. The backstory is clich√©d to hell and eye rolling. But, heck, what am I saying? Story in a flick with a bunch of guys who blow things up? I must be crazy right? The target audience doesn't care about that sort of thing. They want to see guns a blazin and explosions exploding. The last fifteen or so minutes is full of explosions, it is almost overkill. They needed to fill the running time so they added 5 minutes or so of just explosions. Exciting? Not really. The fight scenes are poorly edited, hell even the famous trio scene is half assed. Stallone wanted to get so much in with Willis and the Governator that the scene is way to choppy and loose that it's just a mess. We get it, the three of you in one scene together, cool. Now let me actually enjoy it. Another nit pick I have, Stallone wants to celebrate the old days. The 80's if you will, with this film. Yet he had horrendous CGI effects. The green screen and the blood were so brutally obvious that it's jolting. What's wrong with squibs? If you really wanted to make a throwback action film you would have had those instead of CGI blood. The Expendables is underwhelming, Stallone tries and has some moderate success. I couldn't get pass the whole going back for the woman bit. Eric Roberts makes a good bad guy, but the story revolving around him is pointless filler to get another 'name' in the picture. Stallone wanted to put way too much into this film and he seemed to rely too heavily on that dreadful line that will always come back to bite you in the ass. 'We'll fix it in post'. No you won't.",5,1,5,22 November 2010
The Town," Ben Affleck has his comeback.
","A bank robbery goes a little different than planned when one of the robbers takes a hostage. Doug (Affleck) has to duty to check up on the hostage after she is let go, to see if she knows anything about the crew. Surprise, they start dating. Can he continue his life of robbing banks and have a love life? Will his crew accept that he is with her? Will she ever find out? This is The Town. Gone Baby Gone was his first directorial effort set in the city of Boston, The Town is his second. Ben obviously loves the city and if he keeps making films like these two, I'll be happy with some more Boston. I'm not going to preach about which film is better, their both different. Gone Baby Gone has more of an emotional punch with it's climax and tough decisions. The Town doesn't reach those heights, but it's a well made tense action thriller with a bit of a romance thrown in. This time Affleck is in front of the camera as well. He seems to have left his pretty boy blockbuster image behind him. I'm thankful, I can only take so many Armageddons or Pearl Harbors. He's matured as an actor, this is evident by his roles as of late. State of Play and Hollywoodland are two examples. Of course he's had some fun films in between, but he's probably the best thing about those. Extract anyone? For The Town he has assembled quite the cast. Jeremy Renner, who is hot off of The Hurt Locker plays his buddy with an attitude who won't think twice about pulling the trigger if you're in his way. Mad Men's Jon Hamm who is the FBI agent on their trail, his partner is Man in Black actor Titus Welliver, who was also in Gone Baby Gone. I wouldn't mind seeing more of him in films and if he's Affleck's good luck charm, all the better. Blake Lively has a small role and she does skanky a little too well. She has a thing for Affleck's character and she has a daughter, but he's obviously fallen for someone else. Rebecca Hall, who has the hard role of playing the woman who is dating her abductor. Things don't look too well for this relationship.The Town shows Affleck's ability at directing action sequences. Gone Baby Gone wasn't full of gunfights and car chases, but The Town is. There are three separate heists in the film, the opening, the middle section and the climactic ending. All three are different from each other, one is in a bank, the other a truck and finally a baseball stadium. Each heist was exciting to watch and gave you those Heat moments. It's obviously the Heat was influential in the making of this film. It seems all movies that have robberies in them look to Heat. Ben Affleck had a hand in writing the film, he of course won an Oscar with Matt Damon for writing Good Will Hunting. It appears he's found his footing once again and hopefully the allure of the blockbuster won't claim him once more. The Town is a successful film made for adults. It's slick, well acted and has enough thrilling moments to keep those who seek it entertained. The film centres mostly on Affleck and his new love and the heist bits are second fodder. Renner is the only one who gets some spotlight from the crew, the other two are simply background faces. The Town does it's job as a movie and Ben Affleck has found himself a new career.",8,87,130,18 September 2010
Taxi Driver," On every street in every city, there's a nobody who dreams of being a somebody.
","Scorsese has numerous films that I love and adore, Taxi Driver is one of them, not surprisingly. Is there any other lonely psychopathic character quite like Travis Bickle? I don't think so. It's easy to use words like brilliant, powerful and classic for this flick, so let's use those.Taxi Driver is indeed a classic, it's hard hitting New York underbelly is dirty and raw. The film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the explosive ending. No neat trick here, no special effects to heighten the tension, just like the city it is depicted in, the violence is raw and real. Travis Bickle unleashes terror in the climax and guess what, bullet don't fly off of him. He's not some lone gunman hero that is un-killable. He's no Terminator or Rambo. He's a man. DeNiro, teaming up with Scorsese, is a powerhouse. This lonely and depressed man has dark thoughts, he is one person in a city of millions. The script paints the picture vividly, so well that Scorsese is easily able to paint that picture onto film. This movie needed to be filmed on film, if it were done today and were done with digital, it would never get the same feeling. It is indeed an American classic and is still talked about to this day. It's Scorsese most depressing film. It also gave us that memorable line in the mirror that is par",9,0,0,27 July 2010
Shutter Island," Scorsese + My Favourite Genre = Win
","After the disappearance of one of the patients on Shutter Island, two Marshalls are assigned to the case and figure out what's going on. The only problem is that the people working there aren't really helping, and weird things start happening. Scorsese and my favourite genre? Instant win. The film is so masterfully crafted and well shot that it almost feels too good to be a part of this genre. Yet the script and theme fits perfectly. Yes, I knew the ending when they first showed the trailer ages ago, but that did not spoil the intrigue and suspense this film had. There were even a few surprises added on which was nice. Dicaprio is again, on his game. He pulls out crazy very well. It's not a spoiler that he goes a little crazy while investigating, it's all over the trailers. Added to the cast of characters if Mark Ruffalo, he does his best as the sidekick, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as eerie doctors , Elias Koteas in creepy make-up in one scene and a scene stealing Jackie Earle Haley.The film has it's Kubrick feel here and there, but it's Scorsese's stamp on it. It doesn't reach the heights of his previous efforts, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff that's out there. Scorsese knows this genre well enough to know where to pull the strings. The music is a key part in this and the restriction of jump scares shows that this is a well done film that wants to focus more on it's story, than to scare the audience. That being said, the film is not scary, but it does make you feel uneasy at times. When they go to Ward C, you can't help but feel the hair on your neck stand up as they search the halls.The twist is obvious, but the unravelling of everything is interesting enough to keep your attention. At times I did question myself, but in the end I knew I was right. Scorsese is able to chip away piece by piece the lead character's sanity to make the film work. Some people may feel cheated, others will like it. I found myself liking it, even if some of it is a bit out there.Shutter Island is one of the better films you'll probably see this year, it's no masterpiece and it tends to be a the long side of the running time, but it works.",8,4,8,20 February 2010
Capote," 'And The Oscar For Best Actor Goes To....'
","Truman Capote, a writer for The New Yorker, travels to Kansas after hearing a story about a brutal murder of a family. Capote digs deep into the story, believing that this story will be his greatest work ever. So he can have the perfect ending Capote develops a rather close relationship with one of the killers, Perry Smith. The book becomes one of the greatest books ever written, it is, In Cold Blood.Philip Seymour Hoffman has always been very good in everything he does. From small roles such as Boogie Nights and Cold Mountain, Hoffman always lit up the screen. With Capote, he is able is showcase his talent, as the main star. If you thought Jamie Foxx was brilliant as RAY, then you will be awe-struck by what Hoffman does with Capote. Come Oscar time, get ready to hear 'And the Oscar For Best Actor In A Motion Picture Goes To....Philip Seymour Hoffman'In the past couple of years, the Best Actor and Best Actress winners, Jamie Foxx and Charlize Theron gave brilliant performances in mediocre films. Here, Bennett Miller is able to keep up with the performance and the story. Granted, the movie does drag on in parts and is a tad boring, Capote is one of the better films that is going to be rewarded for it's performances. Miller makes us feel comfortable throughout the movie because he knows that everyone will be amazed by Hoffman's performance, so when we see the actual killings, it strikes a cord. We don't expect it, it comes out of nowhere. The second half of the film is the better half, it where Hoffman's performance really drives the film.Catherine Keener did not amaze me too much. She did a decent job, but her being given an Oscar nomination just proves that there aren't very many good supporting performances out there. Keener's smile always gives her performance away, you see right through the character and all you're left with is Keener. Chris Cooper has too little screen time to work with. Granted, Capote only uses him for information, like he does with the killers.The film does fault with it's pace. Even though it is better then the other films I mentioned, it does go on and on. I almost fell asleep, until Hoffman really got things going. The film is just really depressing and slow moving that it's uncomfortable.Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance, is by fay, the best performance of the year, no doubt. It is the best performance in years. Like Foxx with RAY, Hoffman becomes Capote. Hoffman is so good as Capote it's frightening. He gives us a unique, uneasy, bold, sympathetic, cold, human, performance. Hoffman does the most subtle things with this character that it just brings it life more and more each time, whether it's playing with his ear, or the way he hold a cigarette or even how he holds a glass when he drinks. Every little detail is nailed perfectly by Hoffman. Hoffman makes this film what it is, one of the best performances of the century. Don't listen to all the critics raving about it, don't listen to all the award shows, go and see for yourself.The script shows Capote befriending one of the killers so he can write a book. Capote seems cold and heartless, but then you see what the murderers did and you question yourself, do they deserve it. Capote feels like he is the the middle of a tug of war, between the evil of the killers, and the gentleness he sees. Again, Hoffman pulls this off beautifully. There is no other actor who can portray this character as good as Hoffman has done, and no one should try because they will ultimately fail.See Capote for the riveting performance, then again, that's why everyone is seeing it anyway.",8,2,3,5 February 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Everybody Just Wants To Have Fun.
","Willie Bank back stabs Reuben and it leaves him fighting for his life. The gang hear about this and decide to make Willie lose all his money opening night at his new Casino, which Reuben was supposed to be a partner for.After the wreck that was Oceans Twelve, the gang decided they needed to go out on top, so they decided to throw us Oceans Thirteen. While this third installment is leaps and bounds over the sequel, it still doesn't hold a candle to the original. With everything it does right, there are a few steps they miss. The biggest one? Action. There is no action in this film what so ever. The con itself is a little off as well, nothing big here, they simply make the house lose by rigging all the games. It doesn't turn out to be as exciting, but the laughs are there and there is also some fun had.Everyone is back, with the exception of the two females from the first two. It's not their fight apparently. So it's boys night out. Just like the first two, you can tell that everyone is having fun here and nothing is to be taken too seriously. We have fun because we've been on the ride with them since the first film came out. Since this is the third time around it seems that most of them have very little to do this time around. This was a complaint many had with the second and is another one I have on this one. Bernie Mac is basically useless and used to 'keep tabs' on certain characters. Soderbergh definitely saw that he didn't have much to do, so they threw him in for that task. As well as the character Yen, although for some reason they use him as a high roller. Would they do this? Take this risk for the things at stake? Pacino is a new addition and he's laid back here, surprisingly. He still chews up the scenery though. Ellen Barkin is also a new addition as Pacino's assistant. She plays a tough face, no stretch or anything. The funniest performance is from Casey Affleck, who helps with a strike in Mexico. Even Izzard and Garcia show up again.Some of the things they do are a little stretched, as is the amount of money they have. But we go along for it anyway. We are here to watch the impossible happen. To watch these guys have fun doing the wrong things for the right reasons. The con is nothing special, they rig casino games. Nothing too extravagant, the whole film seems to be not trying as hard. With the sequel they are raising houses, nothing that big here, just rigging card games.In the end, I can give this a recommendation because I did have fun. I never took any of it seriously and neither should you. If you want action and big cons, it won't be here. They go smaller this time. They also pull some twists, which is expected, so it doesn't come as a big shock when it happens. When any of them happen. There are lots of inside jokes as well, if you get them you'll enjoy it a little more. Either way, give it a try.",6,0,1,19 January 2008
Doctor Strange," Decent intro to the mystic arts.
","Going on to about a dozen films or so in the Marvel Universe, there comes a point when you have to present something new to the audience. Everyone was on board with the individual films, which led to the team up of the Avengers. People were blown away with how well they pulled that off. Shift to the second phase of films and we get some decent and generic sequels. Knowing early on that they had to spice things up a bit, Marvel took a chance on some third party characters, hoping that they were unique enough to be considered 'refreshing'. So we are introduced to Guardians and Ant-Man. This seemed to hold the fans attention for a bit longer. Now were closing in on another set of films and I'm sure Marvel was asking themselves, what can we show them now? Their answer is Doctor Strange. A wonderful kaleidoscope of imagery to grab your attention, despite the same tepid story Marvel has been chugging out for years now. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the movies are all good in my book, but I feel that the spectacle will not be the only offering people want in the next phase of films. Strange is a genius surgeon, the best in his field. The only thing that matches his talents is his arrogance...hmmm, sounds like another goatee wearing hero on the marvel universe. Anyway, one night while driving, he ends up in a terrible accident, which destroys his hands. Determined not to live a life of mediocrity, believing he is better than that, Strange dedicates his life to bettering himself. The search takes him to some far corners of the earth and opens his eyes to a new healing power, the power of magic. Quickly learning his new formed powers, Strange must battle some guy who has some evil plan....this is where the story gets a little generic and forgettable. So forgettable, that I forget the villains name, I only remember that he was played by Mads Mikkelsen.That has been one universal issue that everyone agrees on when it comes to Marvel films. The lack of a compelling villain. Save for Loki, the Marvel films have continuously dropped the ball in this department. They seemed to try and steer back into the right direction with this year's Civil War, but Strange seems to throw them back down a peg as Mikkelsen is not given enough screen time to shine. Before I look anything up, if I recall correctly. He was a former student of the Ancient One, who has suffered some personal loss. This turns him evil and he teams up with a giant cloud monster to bring the destruction of earth. Hmm, some pretty hollow motivation if you ask me. So I'll copy and paste some info from the Marvel wiki to clear some of that motivation up.Kaecilius was a sorcerer and a former member of the Masters of the Mystic Arts who became disillusioned with the Ancient One when he felt his mentor was not allowing other dimensions to come to Earth, which he believed could reunite him with his deceased wife and son. He formed the Zealots with the intention of defeating the Ancient One and bringing the inter-dimensional being known as Dormammu to Earth. So with this new information in my mind, I still stand by the fact that these films tend to drop the ball on the villains. So where does the film excel? Well, for starters the aforementioned Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton. I'll admit, at first I was not a fan of her. Her alien like features and dramatic turns seemed to turn me off of her acting in previous films, but I have since developed a new found appreciation for her. I guess if she sticks to genre flicks or quirky comedies, I like her. She is the highlight in Doctor Strange for me. Cumberbatch does well enough for himself, he plays the arrogant jerk to perfection, but he will have more time to develop that role. For now, this film belongs to Swinton. Rounding out the rest of the supporting cast is Chiwetel Ejiofor, with an irritating character arc and Rachel McAdams, relegated to being the girlfriend sidekick. I mentioned earlier the kaleidoscope imagery...I literally meant that. The background images of this film were obviously inspired by the images one would find looking through the glass of the toy. Strange takes the Inception leveled effects and kicks it up a notch and to great effect. These visuals are what makes the film stand out from the other entries. Strange's first venture into other dimensions is trippy enough to warrant a viewing. Doctor Strange is another generic entry into the Marvel franchise, but those generic entries are still pretty damn entertaining. The film fumbles with the villain and some forced comedic bits that don't land, but is strong enough entertaining you that you might not mind. It cleverly sidesteps the usual 'city destruction' climax and turns it on its head. Doctor Strange is a welcomed addition to the series.",7,1,1,3 January 2017
Corpse Bride," 'Relies more on visually pleasing the audience'
","Victor messed up his vows during a wedding rehearsal, and is traveling through the woods, reciting his vows. He stops to rest in the woods,and while practicing, he gets them right and puts his wedding ring on a finger-shaped stick in the ground and says his wedding vows. The stick turns out to be a rotted finger belonging to a murdered girl, who returns as a zombie and insists that she is now Victor's lawfully wedded wife.When seeing this film, one will make the connection to The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is unfair in the sense that they are two totally different films, only similar in the animation. Leave it to Tim Burton to take us inside his 'cooky-artist' head to bring us the beautiful Corpse Bride.Technically, Corpse Bride is ahead of the race in every sense of the word. Lightyears ahead of NBC in terms of style, with quirky characters bug eyes and legs as thin as toothpicks. Stop-motion animation is a form that should be more explored in film. Corpse Bride unfortunately relies too heavily on it's animation and strays away from it's story.It seems the motivation of the main character, to fall in love with this corpse is a little hard to follow. At first, he's terrified of her, then wants to run and hide from her, then falls in love with her and will die for her...but loves someone else in the end. Corpse Bride takes all these emotions throws them into a blender and hits the ultra mix button. This leaves the viewer with an awkward feeling at the end towards our so called hero.Okay, so it is a kids movie, so harping on the emotional value could be unfair. But Depp as the lead offers nothing to the movie, which his character always looking shocked, we get Depp voicing it all whimpy. It's good to see the other cast members giving their voices more range, I mean when you hear Christopher Lee's voice as the towns Pastor it's so deep and recognizable that anyone can notice. Helena Bonham Carter does the best with her incredible singing talent and voiced with a lot of depth and emotion.Danny Elfman's score, along with everyother Burton movie, takes the film to another level. With surprise musical numbers, which aren't too apparent in films these days. It takes you back to those old Disney films.Seeing the underworld, so vibrant and alive, and seeing the living world, so dreadful and dead, it makes you wonder who's really who in this world. Seeing the two at opposite ends is a feast for the eyes, which is what many people will see this movie for. If you're looking for great animation and musical numbers, then Corpse Bride is the film for you, other-wise the story is kinda of dead.",7,0,1,13 October 2005
Forrest Gump," A Film Everyone Should Watch.
","Forrest Gump tells the story of, well Forrest Gump. The man was born with some disabilities, but he has overcome them and somehow seems to be present at a lot of historical moments. He's in love with his childhood friend Jenny, who constantly eludes him. The film that beat my favourite film of all time at the Oscars. I'm not hating it, I think that both films deserved the title. Forrest Gump is something else. It seems to have been one of those, right place at the right time flicks. Everything about it simply works, it's heartwarming, funny, intelligent and depressing. Tom Hanks gave us an unforgettable performance that goes down in history as one of the greatest. He is lost in this character and Gump takes a life of it's own. Probably one of the most lovable characters in the history of cinema. Jenny, the woman of his affections is played by Robin Wright Penn, her performance is almost saddening. Her life is constantly spiraling out of control and you can do nothing to stop it. Gary Sinise is hilarious as Lt. Dan, the hard ass in the army who loses his legs. We love to hate it at the beginning, then we come around, much like his character. Speaking of losing legs, despite the film not needing a heavy load of CGI, it uses it beautifully. Inserting Gump into old footage and giving Sinise the lack of legs among other things. These are small things compared to what people are doing today, but Zemeckis has always been one to push technology in films, here he does it very well and never does it encompass the film. The story is forefront, something that he needs to get back into.Forrest Gump is an everyman film. Meaning the almost everyone will like it. Some political messages may turn people the other way, but the overall feel of the film is something that a lot of people share. Every once in a while there is one film that touches a lot of people, I think Forrest Gump is one of those films. Even though the film goes off in many different directions, it works. Forrest in the army in one segment, then running around the country in another? I love it.",8,2,3,6 June 2010
Ant-Man," What Could Have Been?
","Ant-Man had the opportunity to be one of the most visually bizarre and interesting Marvel films to date. I think back to the pre-production stages of the film and was pretty puzzled that Edgar Wright was the man behind this project. Could he work with such a big studio, being the visually distinct director that he is? The answer was of course no. He left the project and we got The Break-Up's Peyton Reed. That's not a negative to Reed, he does his job in giving the audience an approachable Marvel superhero film. But...I keep asking myself that questions; 'What could have been?'Scott Lang is a master thief who just got out of prison. Hank Pym is a genius inventor who's been keeping an eye on Lang for some time. You see, Pym was the original Ant-Man. He has hidden the suit and the secrets to it for years in fear of it falling into the wrong hands. His predecessor, Darren Cross is trying to replicate the same formula and Pym must train a new Ant-Man is stop Cross from achieving his diabolic plans. Scott Lang is the new Ant-Man.Much like Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man had an uphill battle to be taken seriously. A superhero that is the size of an ant? How can that possibly be good? Well, Marvel has done it again, they delivered a good movie. That's all this film is though, a good movie. The film plays it so safe and by the book that I was actually taken back a bit. If anyone of the new superheroes could fall in line with the rough edged Guardians, surely it would be this one right? Nope. Ant-Man is so safe it could be a kids movie....in fact, it just might be a kids movie. CGI overload of course, every time we shrink to the size of an ant. Interesting perspective at times, blurry at others due to the kinetic nature of the plot. The most impressive use of CGI has to be in the first 5 minutes, with a young Michael Douglas being all Benjamin Button on us. I was hoping that the effects flipping our protagonist and antagonist would result in something new, something fun or interesting in the fight or chase sequences, but Reed doesn't seem interested in that. He seems more interested in playing ball with the suits behind the camera. 'We need this to be shown so we can see it develop at a later time in another film'. Hence the entire Falcon sequence, which seems out of place, if neat. Rudd is a decent superhero. He has the comedic timing to be likable, much like Chris Pratt. He was able to work his body into shape, much like Chris Pratt. Also, he walks that fine line of bad-boy, likable schmuck. Much like....you get the idea. Douglas plays mentor here and has one scene where he gets to act a little bit with his on screen daughter, played by Evangeline Lilly. If Paul Rudd isn't funny enough for everyone, Michael Pe√±a fills that void as the sidekick. I think Corey Stoll, who hams it up a bit as the villain, does the more interesting things. Everyone else seems to simply service the role, not taking any chances, or bringing anything new to the table. I'm glad to see Stoll get some bigger roles now. All in all, Ant-Man is serviceable to the big budget superhero genre. It doesn't really further the Marvel agenda, nor does it re-invent anything. It will most likely be forgotten in a few years and find itself somewhere in the middle road of the list on people's 'Best Marvel Films'. That's the problem with this film, it's just perfectly content with being good movie and nothing more.",6,0,2,21 November 2015
Fargo," Coens Score Again.
","The Coens blend their dark comedy routine into this murder story and create an instant classic. The shock and awe of one particular scene is lost on me because I saw this film years after it's release and knew about it before hand. Yet it still had an impact on me.Steve Buscemi is perfect as the 'funny looking fella' who never shuts up (which is why he is constantly told to shut up by Walter in The Big Lebowski) and the counterpart of Peter Stomare is chilling. When the kidnap the wife, it works in both comedy and terror.William H. Macy plays the loser who comes up with this so called brilliant plan, but it never goes his way. People say when you write a script, you throw your character in a tree and while up there throw rocks at him. At the end you let him down, but with Fargo, Macy stays up there. He takes a beating in this film and nothing works out for him.The script is written with a sense of irony. It is a serious crime drama and the Coen's sprinkle of comedy throughout. The film is brilliant in a way. Specifically when we see Buscemi walk up the backyard steps of the house he's about to break into while the wife just sits there watching him speechless. It's not until he literally breaks the glass that she screams and runs away. Funny and entertaining stuff, it works so well in this film.I'm upset I didn't see this one sooner then I did and that I wasn't a fan the first time around. The film shows the talent of the Coens and their ability to create something that will b e remembered years from now.",9,0,1,20 July 2009
Nightcrawler," One Of The Year's Best Films.
","Jake Gyllenhaal gives the performance of his career in Nightcrawler in which he plays an alien, who learns everything he needs to know through the internet, but lacks any kind of empathy for the human race. At least that's how I saw it.Alien, that's the best way to describe how Lou Bloom interacts with people. Each conversation seems more like a wager on what Lou can take away from it. He doesn't ever have a normal conversation with someone. He always has an angle and he always gets his way. Case in point, the dinner scene with Rene Russo. At first this seems like a scene in which he is trying to score a date of some kind of her. He's a weird guy and we all know his advances will eventually be shut down, but he turns the tables on her and us pretty quickly and his ulterior motives are revealed. One of the best scenes of the film and of the year.His dialogue his fast and to the point. He doesn't ever waste a breath or a word on something that doesn't give him some slight advantage in some way. I so hope come award time, Gyllenhaal is given the recognition he deserves. The title serves the film perfectly. This movie takes place 90% of the time at night. Shot beautifully in a cold dark tone with bright lights that emulate the bright light that Lou wants to chase. His dream. Does he want to be in the TV business? Who knows. He's shown wanting a job, any job and this is just something that he's good at that people want. He has no problem crossing ethical, legal and moral lines to get the shot. Sometimes, shockingly, he will change the perspective of the truth to support his gain. With a memorable soundtrack, slick direction and a script that deserves awards, Nightcrawler is one of the best films of the year.",8,0,1,15 December 2014
The Aviator," Up there with the driver and the fellas.
","Fantastic. That's what The Aviator is. Yeah, it's a little long, but overall, fantastic. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career in this, and Marty is excellent as always. He's paid his dues, I think it's time Academy voters. Yeah, it's not as good as many of his other films, but is still very excellent in its own right.The music, the cinematography, and oh, the colours of it all. All excellent and visually grand. One of the best aspects of the film.The acting was great also, of course DiCaprio. Cate Blanchett was alright, little on my nerves, Kate Beckinsale was very good with what little she had, and even the bit parts by Gwen Stefani, Jude Law and even random cameo by Willem Dafoe were all very well acted. I was disappointed with the lack of more for Ian Holm to do, but he still did very well.Overall, a solid effort, and a 9/10 approval. Not the best film of the year, but deserving of recognition. One of Marty's best films, ranking up with the likes of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas. (Although, not better)",9,1,5,25 February 2005
Oblivion," If 2001 & Moon had a Hollywood love child
","After a war with an alien species, Earth has been left in shambles. Two humans stay behind to help repair drones associated with the extraction of Earth's remaining resources. After some unusual circumstances, one of the team members begins to question his mission and purpose. The ads for this movie reveal nothing, yet reveal everything at the same time. It's an odd feeling going into this film knowing nothing about it, but knowing where most of the story will go. Near the end of the film you'll get this strange feeling that you've seen this all before. Well, you have. While Oblivion tends to borrow a lot of elements from better sci/fi films, it's enjoyable enough to keep your attention till the last scene. Oblivion is basically if 2001: A Space Odyssey and Moon had a Hollywoodized love child, which is both a positive and negative. Tom Cruise plays the hero of this story, Jack Harper. A man given the task of repairing drones that are to protect these vessels that are extracting Earth's water supply. We are told the humans had to leave Earth and are on one of Jupiter's moons. Both Cruise and Andrea Riseborough who plays his female counterpart Victoria have two weeks left of their mission before they can return to the TET. The drones are protecting the vessels from the alien species that attacked Earth. Now the story takes a few twists and turns which will have some people glued to the screen and others scratching their heads. By the end of the film all is revealed and cleared up, I for one appreciated the slow revelations of what is truth and what is fiction. Both Morgan Freeman and Olga Kurylenko show up in the film, I don't wish to reveal their characters or purpose because the mystery is integral to the story, even if it's obvious from the get go. Freeman unfortunately is given very little to do and shows up in only 3 scenes. Kurylenko is given more, but I still wanted more of an emotional draw from her performance. Both Cruise and Riseborough do well in their respective roles. Cruise's character is more concerned with exploration and knowledge, while Riseborough is more by the book and stick to the mission. Both characters are at opposite ends of the same mission. Cruise does well here, as usual. He always gives 100 percent in his roles, which I admire. He manages to balances both the emotional weight and the action needed for this film. Joseph Kosinski is the director, who also gave us the visually stunning Tron: Legacy. Oblivion seems to be giving him more to work with from a story stand point, but the visuals are what will draw you in. Cruise is flying around a destroyed Earth with only little remnants of our history. The sequences of him in his ship are great and Kosinski knows how to handle his action sequences. The sleek design of the ship and use of white everywhere might make you think that Apple is in control in the future, but it's obvious the influences in this film are mainly Kubricks 2001 and the Rockwell mind bender Moon. Oblivion is a decent sci/fi film that makes you ask some questions, while being throughly entertained. While it's not as deep as either of the above mentioned films and feels more Hollwood, it's good enough to recommend.",7,1,3,20 April 2013
Burn After Reading," Coens Rushed This Film
","After a disc containing the memoirs of a recently fired CIA analyst ends up in the hands of two dim wits who work at a gym, they go around trying to sell it thinking it contains important classified CIA stuff.The Coen brothers are taking a different shift from last years highly praised 'No Country For Old Men' and going back into their comedy genre in which they seem to excel at. Here is a film that is full of characters that do stupid things, at yet we still seem to like them. Even when they are hacking away at other people. While 'Burn After Reading' is a decent film, the entire project feels rushed and the ending too forced. It's as if they had no other way of ending the film, so they tack on the wrap up job.The film opens with the firing of John Malkovich, because he seems to be an alcoholic. We are introduced to his wife, Tilda Swinton, who is having an affair with George Clooney. Clooney is also married, but is not satisfied with just those two women, so he begins dating Francis Macdormand. She has been trying to find love online with no luck. Her co-worker, Brad Pitt, finds the disc with the CIA stuff and they both begin to blackmail Malkovich. Somehow these stories intertwine with each other in a dark and humorous manner.Everyone involved seems to be having fun. Brad Pitt and George Clooney are specially funny in their roles. One as a young, gum-chewing, doofus. The other as a paranoid treasurer who decides to build a very unique chair. Both Clooney and Pit are playing against type. Which is nice to see from such big A list actors, in a comedy anyway.McDormand is another one to watch. She seems to slide into this role perfectly, nailing every bit of dialogue that comes out of her mouth. It seems natural, even though most of the dialogue is not. Malkovich is the alcoholic CIA analyst who is mentally breaking down. Losing his job, cheating wife and other things. This character is dragged through the mud until he decides to explode. Malkovich plays it with a sense of integrity. An upper class way of presenting himself, much like how he portrayed himself in 'Being John Malkovich.' Tilda Swinton seems to have the cold hearted bitch role down pat.For those expecting a laugh out loud comedy, you'll be really disappointed. 'Burn After Reading' is a slow moving film. It wasn't until half way through did it really start to kick up and peak my interest. There are a couple bits that are really funny, and others then just seem out of place. Don't expect it all to but fluffy funny stuff, this is a dark film. It is a Coen film after all.J.K. Simmons has a small role as a CIA supervisor who has no idea as to what is going on with these character. The audience feels the same way. While it's not entirely hard to follow, some people may have some problems with it. I guess that could have been there intention, especially with how they ended the film.While 'Burn After Reading' is good, it's not Coen good and that may disappoint some fans. But the film is basically about stupid people doing stupid things, done in an intelligent way. The film has a few surprises, I was caught off guard at least twice. I just hope they put more time and effort into their next project.",7,3,7,12 September 2008
Watchmen," Is It Worth The Wait?
","I think it goes without saying that the film would never be as good as the book. It's a statement that is so obvious that I'm surprised I'm even stating it here. In reviewing a film based on literature, one should make the distinction of not really comparing the two. It's simply not fair. Comparisons will rise, no doubt, but the two mediums are vastly different. With books, you can go anywhere, do anything, nothing is limited. Film on the other hand, has so many limitations that it feels like it should be viewed in a category on it's own. The film is a pretty accurate depiction of the novel, the changes that were made I had no opposition to. Things were obviously left out, some things I knew would be gone, some things I hoped would make it in. The film clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, so it may seem like it will drag in places and near the end it does. Whenever Dr. Manhattan was on the screen, I was so happy. He was a marvel in the book and here as well. Every time he was on the screen I was glued to it, could not look away. Although, when on Mars when he is discussing he feelings with humanity, I found myself slightly bored. Which is a shame because it is a pivotal moment in the film. Billy Crudup plays a character devoid of any emotion. He pulls it off. I enjoyed his performance. During the trailer I was upset with his voice, but during the film I did not mind it. I loved his eyes and every little turn of his head.Malin Akerman on the other hand has gotten a lot of flack for her performance and I say it was because the character isn't even likable. I found her annoying and whiny, here she just seems boring. No connection to Manhattan, but more importantly Dan. I just did not really buy their relationship on screen. She does look beautiful in (and out) of that suit though and can kick some ass. Speaking of Dan, Night Owl is two characters. A kickass superhero and an overweight man who needs his glasses to see. Wilson captured both pretty well. His nervousness is there and I thought he brought that character to life. The one casting spot the fans seemed to hate the most, I enjoyed quite a bit. Matthew Goode did a decent job here, much to my surprise, even though I knew he wasn't going to be as bad as people were saying.Both Jackie Earle Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan play the psychopaths in this flick. Morgan shows his stuff in the characters flashbacks, aging from a young arrogant bastard, to an old crying slob. After his introduction and flashback scenes he has nothing else to do with the film and I wanted to see more of his sorry ass. Haley was the highlight of the film for me. What a badass character he gets to play, with the mask on and off. He pulled it off extremely well.Why oh why did the make-up department fail so badly though? Looking at Silk Spectre in her old age was horrible. She looks like she had play dough rubbed on her face, Nixon too. Even The Comedian to an extent, whose fight sequence went on a tad too long. Punching through walls, really? The soundtrack was spot on, maybe too spot on for some, but I dug it. The film's highlight, other than Dr. Manhattan's origins telling, is the fantastic montage opening credits to the tune of Bob Dylan. I loved it. Couldn't get enough of it. It immediately sets you in this alternate universe and you know the history. Pick up the soundtrack, I know I will.The film looks beautiful, no question . Sin City had it's own atmosphere, as did 300 and now Watchmen. I just didn't sit there and see this world they were living in, I felt a part of it. I loved the blue of Manhattan glowing everywhere, I loved the neon signs and the gritty streets.Some parts did have the Zack Snyder stamp all over them, most notably the prison scene in which Night Owl and Spectre II fight off some prisoners down the corridor. Just seemed like 300 all over again to me. I did enjoy Rorschach kicking ass though. Snyder's pacing was a bit off as well, time spent on some characters more greatly then others. His choice to have the characters seem more super than human was also a bit weird. This was most noticeable in the climax when characters are bouncing off solid objects and nothing really seems to happen to them.A lot of the core themes and elements were sort of lost to me in the translation. Viewers will get lost in the gorgeousness of it and might miss the smaller parts that really make Watchmen what it is. These characters are not super at all, they all have problems. I feel that many people will miss this, the film kind of did. Give me more little things with the main characters. Rorschach is suppose to be the psychopath, yet he seems to be the only one with a level head on his shoulders most of the time.In the end, the film is a good adaptation of the book. I enjoyed it on it's own merits and on the comparison to the source material. At times it tries to be brilliant, like the novel, but it doesn't come off like that. I wanted the entire film to be brilliant, but ended up with an entertaining movie that I would love to watch over again and again.",8,1,5,8 March 2009
Baby Driver," 'This one, they say that listens to the music all the time?'
","Baby Driver falls perfectly in line with Wright's previous films in style, but offers a bit more in dramatic tone and a little less in comedy. The film still has plenty of funny moments, but it depicts a slight change in direction for him and one that hopefully opens more doors for original films. Baby, that's B-A-B-Y, is the getaway driver for a wealthy criminal, Doc, who plots out the heists and never uses the same crew twice. Baby insists he is done after one last job, but Doc is willing to threaten the lives of the people Baby loves, including his new waitress girlfriend Debora, if he doesn't pull one more stunt. Going into a Wright film, you have a sense of what to expect. Hot Fuzz was a parody of action films to the point where a simple moment of putting on your jacket was made to look like a chaotic action sequence. With Baby Driver, Wright continues this style, but squarely plants the film itself into that world that Hot Fuzz was parodying. This is done with self awareness though, and never becomes a problem. Instead, it highlights the originality of the film and the world Wright has created. It's a heightened reality and music plays an important role in it. To the point where it feels more like a love letter to music than heist films. This is even more apparent when you realize that we never really get to see the heists. We stay with Baby in the car and subvert those expectations. We are with Baby and his music the whole way. As I said earlier, music is important to this film and ever aspect of it revolves around that. Camera work, action sequences, character movements, dialogue, plot devices, the list goes on. For something that important, the music should be good. Wright manages to explore enough genres to please most people and I found myself really digging the playlists. Music is Baby's world and we live in it for 2 hours almost non-stop. To the point where when there is no music playing, it feels out of place. I fully expect people to go out and buy the soundtrack and at no point did I feel as if any of it was forced, like Suicide Squad. I guess you want to know about the car chase sequences, those are thrilling for people looking for excitement. Wright gives us enough unique moments to make those memorable and it's needed because car chases are a staple in Hollywood movies. You want to see something new and Baby Driver delivers enough of a spin to make it seems fresh. The film balances itself out with plenty of small quiet sequences that focus on character. Baby's dedication to take care of his aging foster father is touching. They communicate through sign language, which adds another layer to the complicated character that is Baby. Then we have some tender moments with Baby and Debora. A love at first sight relationship that blooms due to charm, appreciation of music and the aspirations to just be on the open road. Baby Driver is stylish and charges to you at full speed. With the camera almost constantly moving, it never feels slow, even in those quiet moments. The cast nail their roles with just a hint of self awareness. Spacey can be intimidating in his sleep and Foxx has no problem playing someone with a few screw lose moments. At the very least, when you walk away from this movie you can say that you had a fun time, this movie has plenty of those moments to make it great.",8,12,21,29 June 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," Most disappointing film of 2003
","Revolutions was disappointing. Its too bad too, I liked Reloaded and I liked the Matrix In the first Matrix there were many ideas crucial to the plot that were just taken for granted by everyone, such as the existence of an 'Oracle' inside the matrix, as well as the existence of a 'One', wow after Reloaded I had hundreds of theories, and when this film came out, to see none of them revealed, or anything remotely good at all, it takes a dive into crap.This is the weak spot in the trilogy, it does have the best special effects, even the phony SUPER PUNCH to Smith's face was alright. It is the darkest, with death to some main characters, but I guess it's a main problem is that the Wachowski brothers couldn't come up with an ending to please themselves, so they just threw one together. It is probably the worst way to end a trilogy that could of easily become one of the greatest.The acting in both of the Matrix films are flat, with this one showing the most emotion from Reeves without the aid of SIGHT, which impressed me very much. Morpheus is nothing but a supporting character here and Trinity just follows Neo everywhere, then dies...again. OH GOD the death scene, it went all Shakespeare on us here and dragged on a bit too long. The Kid, it's safe to say that this is the Jar Jar of The Matrix. His dialouge was horrible and terribly delivered, 'Neo, I believe' Had me laughing to tear out of embarrassment The fight scenes...wow, and not in a good way. First of all we get a rehashed version of the lobby scene in the first one, but how do we make it different, oh we'll get the upside down. Very interesting...please, show us something tangible. How about the Smith/Neo fight, have you've ever seen an episode of Dragon Ball Z, well, yea, that's basically what the fight is, fly around kick here and there and then just give in. Can you say way too many rain bubbles, 3 is enough, not more. The Zion VS Machines was the highlight of this film, it was beautiful and suspenseful, everything I imagined it to be.The machine city was interesting, and beautiful, the orange/yellow lights, neo's power that is stretches beyond the matrix, all the way to the source, please, that's a cop out. Neo and Trinity soaring beyond the skies, seeing the beautiful sun, just before dipping back into hell, beautiful.Every character that was the least bit interesting was useless here. The Merovingian, Perphosone, Seraph, Twins (not present, come on they didn't die). I expected a kick ass fight between the smiths and seraph, but got nothing. Every fight scene was a let down.The story relies on it's viewers to know everything about the the matrix universe, you need to play the games, you need to watch the animatrix, read the comics, just like Episode III. 'Holy ****, it's wingless' What does this mean, Serpah has an outer shell like the Oracle, and this is his new one? I don't want to go to the games to get the answers.Overall, I was disappointed with the outcome of this movie, it was a let down, maybe because it was over-hyped, maybe because it was simply crap...I'll never know.",6,4,6,26 August 2005
Man of Steel," Nolan & Snyder Tackle Superman
","Krypton is dying and Jor-El makes the brave decision to save his newborn son, Kal-El, by sending him off into the stars in the hopes of preserving their race. The newborn lands on Earth and as he grows older, is told to keep his powers a secret, for if the world found out, they would reject him. He travels the world looking for answers as to who he is and where he came from. He finds those answers when General Zod arrives, another survivor from the planet Krypton. He has the same goal as Jorl-El did, preserving the race...even if it means destroying another. Man of Steel is Warner Brother's attempt at getting another franchise off the ground. Now that Harry Potter and Batman are done, they have nothing. so they go to the one man from their past who they know can resurrect a dead franchise: Christopher Nolan. With Nolan as the Producer, veteran comic scribe David S. Goyer behind the screenplay and the visual comic book flair eye behind the camera, Zack Snyder, it looked like WB had put all their eggs in one basket. For the most part, it paid off. Man of Steel has it's fair share of problems, I walked away from it with the same feeling I had with The Dark Knight Rises (which was I really enjoyed it, but the problems it has were very apparent). This is a new take on the traditional superhero. This time, Nolan brings in his dark and brooding style to this franchise. Some people dislike this new look and feel, Superman hardly smiles, the world does not love him and the film is dead serious. There are little to no moments of humour. Nolan is taking a...wait, THE, definition of a Superhero and planting him into a real word realm, much like he did with Batman. While some people will be turned off by this, I actually found it kind of refreshing. Yes, we have another superhero who grapples with issues, but these are issues that he should be struggling with. Who is he, where does he come from, what is his purpose. Nolan and Snyder explore this notion and they do it well.The narrative of the film is told in two segments, the present timeline which is Kent looking for answers to his past and the other timeline are flashbacks to pivotal moments in his life growing up. The flashback sequences feel like segments from Malick's Tree of Life, which fits the Kansas setting perfectly. Costner and Lane play Superman's Earth parents. Costner feels the need to hide Kurt's powers, he fears the world is not ready for someone like him, but he's Superman after all. So that need to save people, no matter what is there. Lane is given the short end of the stick here and is given very little to do. Superman's other parents are played by Russel Crowe and Ayelet Zurer. We are introduced to them in an overly long prologue sequence set on Krypton. It feels like a scene that could have been told in ten minutes, instead it feels like twenty. The look and feel of Krypton is lackluster in the sense that we get an Avatar/Matrix hybrid of sorts with flying winged monsters and test tube babies. So the film kind of starts off on a misstep, but once we get to Earth, the film finds its footing. Goyer finds a way to keep Russel around much longer than he needs to be. Although Crowe does bring a bit of charisma to a nothing role. Things get a little harry for Superman when a being who calls himself General Zod arrives. From that moment on the film feels less like a Superman film and more like an Alien Invasion movie and I feel like that was their intention. There is more destruction in this film than in last years Avengers or any of the Transformers movies. The last hour or so is relentless action and destruction. To the point where I didn't know if I could take it anymore. You can only throw a guy through several buildings so many times before it gets tiresome. Snyder is a visual director and he manages to keep the action going with some beautiful shots. These characters move at incredible speeds, so the fight sequences are CGI heavy. Usually when a film has to animate a human, it looks fake, here they seem to pull it off nicely. General Zod is played by Michael Shannon. He plays up the bad guy role well enough for me to give a pass to. We know his intentions, we know he is a threat and Shannon seems to be having some fun with the role, despite the seriousness of the tone. He goes over the top and it works. Cavill is great as Superman, he has the looks, the build and the charisma. He's just never really given that one moment that I think he needed to really 'sell' that Superman role. The one thing he seems to do different (other than brooding) is scream a lot. Unfortunately one of the biggest problems with the film is the chemistry between Adams and Cavill. Lane and Superman seem to have none of it and their moment at the end felt false. Although she does a much better job than the train wreck that was Bosworth. Man of Steel is a great Superhero movie. It follows in the steps of Nolan's Batman series more than what Marvel is doing with their characters. I urge people not to expect that Superman from the past, goes he's gone. This new one is here to stay.",8,1,3,15 June 2013
28 Weeks Later," A Surprisingly Good Sequel.
","28 Days Later was a suspenseful, atmospheric and thrilling addition to the 'zombie' genre. At least until the third act, when the film loses it's direction and ultimately failed to reinvest interest. I put zombie in quotes because any fan of the film will tell you they are not zombies, just infected people with a virus. When I heard that a sequel was coming out, I figured it would be even worse because a sequel being better than the original is rare, specifically in this generation of film-making.28 Weeks Later furthers the story, this time with new characters. The virus is gone and re-population has begun. The American army is in charge and have everything under control. That would seem like a boring movie, so of course they have to have the virus come back and wreck havoc. Which it does. In a very lame way I might add.The film opens with an attack on a house, this is the highlight of the film. The film never reaches the same height of excitement as this, but it does keep the viewer interested. I was never bored and found that it did work well as a sequel. It doesn't have the same feel as the first. All the atmosphere that made the original good is gone here. I felt more threatened by the infected in the first because it was them against ordinary people. Here, we have guns, helicopters and apparently tons of napalm.In one scene the soldiers bomb half the city, it looks cool, but seems ineffective, they later use gas that seems to kill everyone in sight. My question is why not use this gas first, it sure as hell beats out blowing up half the city. Small things like this are all over this film. Lead a bunch of civilians into one room for 'protection'. Of course this is one room in which the infected gain access, other people are left unguarded and creatures run around unnoticed in this government building. These things aside, the film is really well done and very enjoyable. It serves the genre well and is ultimately more enjoyable then the first.Boyle acts as producer this time around, so the feel of the film is not all that different and the film does offer some intense moments. There is one sequence in which our characters go underground to the subway system. It's totally dark and one uses night vision from a rifle to see. They filmmakers use this to show us exactly what she sees, in a first person type of way. Very effective and scary.The gore has been turned up a notch, with more blood splatter and a severe beating of one person that may turn some stomachs. There is another scene in which they use the blades from the helicopter to make quite a mess.This is an entertaining sequel that manages to actually be better, albeit not by much, to the original. It adds new elements, but doesn't necessarily take the story into new directions. It is better than one would expect.",7,0,0,20 July 2009
The Revenant," 'I ain't afraid to die anymore. I'd done it already.'
","Fifteen minutes into the film, right after the Native attack that opens the story, two people next to me got up and left the theatre. It was about ten minutes after that that I looked over to my wife, she seemed bored out of her mind. As the credits rolled, I asked her what she thought. She went on to list off all her problems with the film, mainly the length and how 'boring' she found it. I on the other hand, found it utterly visceral in the unrelenting grittiness that bathed over my eyeballs. After a vicious bear attack, Hugh Glass is left battered and beaten. His men try their best to help transport him back to their settlement, yet the harsh environments and tracking Natives on their heels make it near impossible. Three men, including his son, decide to stay behind with him, while the others venture forward. One of those men is Fitzgerald, who only volunteers due to the promise of extra money when they return. Fed up with waiting, Fitzgerald takes matters into his own hands, leaving Glass behind to die. Fueled by revenge, Glass is determined to stay alive, crawl 200 miles and kill the man responsible for leaving him in the dirt.There's been a lot of talk about the behind the scenes drama surrounding this film. Multiple crew members quit mid production over the shooting conditions, which included harsh cold weather, dangerous stunts and only using natural light. The trials and tribulations of those who created this film, benefits us, the audience. The film is absolutely gorgeous and should undoubtedly win Lubezki a third straight Oscar for the cinematography, a first in the Academy's history. There were multiple moments where I simply sat in awe at some of the beautifully painted pieces of nature that both Lubezki and I√±√°rritu give us. There were many times during this film that I felt like I was watching a Malick film, which makes sense since Lubezki shot The New World, which feels similar to The Revenant. There's been a lot of buzz around Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, how it might finally earn him that alluding Oscar statue. Honestly, he deserves it. The man ate raw meat and he's a damn vegetarian. Most of his performance, which is brutally savage, has him fighting for his life. He doesn't say much, it's hard to talk after having your throat slashed by a bear. DiCaprio always delivers great performances in my opinion, this one took him to his utter limits. It's hard to see another performance this year that deserves it more. I pass equal praise to Tom Hardy who stars as Fitzgerald, the 'villain' of the picture. Hardy always seems to disappear into his roles, this one is no different. He's equal parts menacing and rough. DiCaprio is strong and you need just as strong a performance to support him, Hardy does this in spades. I'm sure there are people out there that will have the same reaction as my wife. The film isn't perfect, it has some issues. There are numerous sequences that showcase DiCaprio's dead wife, these elements stall the already lengthy film. Had these sequences been cut out completely, or even down to one scene, it would have helped significantly. The film clocks in just under two and a half hours. That is a long film about a fur trapper slowly making his way across some rough terrain. Add on top of that the long take shots that I√±√°rritu loves to show off and you have yourself a film that feels long. I√±√°rritu loves to showoff his fancy camera work, he did this almost obnoxiously with Birdman a film I did like. He does it again here, sometimes to great effect, sometimes to annoyance. The camera gets so close to the actors at times that their heavy breathing literally fogs up the lens of the camera. It takes you out of the experience and reminds you, this is a film.......but what a film it is.",8,20,41,9 January 2016
Split," A Return To Form For Shyamalan, Great Performance from McAvoy.
","I get the feeling that Shyamalan wrote and directed this film, got it down to the 2 hour running time and screened it. Then the studio asked him; 'Shyamalan, don't your movies always have twists? Why doesn't this film have a twist? I think this film needs a twist. Put a twist in'. Then Shyamalan decides to tack some cheap ending onto an otherwise suspenseful film with a career performance from McAvoy. Now people might be upset that I said this film has a twist because saying that is in fact a spoiler. This spoils nothing. The so-called twist, if you even want to call it that, has nothing to do with the film and makes me question why the hell such a scene exists in this film to being with. Now...in saying all that. I honestly don't know if I hated it or loved it. I'm split. (Bad dad joke)McAvoy plays Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Kevin Wendell Crumb / Barry / Orwell / Jade...etc. He kidnaps three young girls and brings them to his lair. The girls are desperate to escape and try everything they can, but soon realize that their kidnapper is not all there. Each of his personalities have completely different conversations with them and himself. Can they escape before 'he' arrives, a yet to be discovered 24th personality? We can all agree that when the name M. Night Shyamalan is attached to a project, the groans, the eye rolling and the utter disinterest immediately hits you. Whatever goodwill he did with his first three films seems to have been completely destroyed with The Happening, Last Airbender and After Earth. A low budget horror flick came out recently, from Shyamalan, and people were surprised at how not terrible it was. The Visit was a found footage film and Shyamalan managed to use it to pretty good results. Now he Split, a suspense thriller that boarders body horror and I think it's another hit. The film relies, heavily, on James McCoy's performance and I'm glad to say it's really strong. He's able to snake his way in and out of the vastly different personalities on a whim and each one is as believable as the last. He gives 100% in his performance here, being terrifying, funny and sad at any moment. Anya Taylor-Joy is the 'lead' girl out of the three, we are given snippets of a backstory through some flashbacks. She's damaged and fits the victim role perfectly. The problem is that we've seen it all before, trouble girl is trapped and has to muster the strength to fight back. Split was really fun and tense. I'd love to see Shyamalan stick to this genre and stay away from big budgets. The run time might work against the film, it runs two hours and can easily lose some material, but as a whole this film worked for me.",7,2,11,21 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," From a non-book reading perspective.
","Harry Potter is in some trouble, his headmaster has been killed, by Snape of all people and the dark lord's powers seem to be rising. Harry must find and destroy as many Horcruxes as he can find, in his journey he learns about the Deathly Hallows. This entry is probably the best in the series since Prisoner of Azkaban. David Yates, who has helmed two previous installments in the franchise (arguably some of the weaker films) has finally seemed to find his footing with the first part of the last installment. Deathly Hallows is exciting, heartfelt and continues the story at a brisk pace, setting the viewer up for wanting more and ending the film on a good note. The thing that helps the film most is how much crap has hit the fan. The story has finally moved past the years at Hogwarts routine and has set in motion the final battle that people have been eagerly anticipating. The biggest gripe about the films from the 4th book on, would be that they leave out too much. It's understandable, since the books get bigger and bigger. Splitting the finale into two parts was a good idea, both from a business standpoint and a filmmaking standpoint. It gives the audience more time with Harry and the filmmakers more time to tell the complete story. I read the first book, it was good. It was gift, but I never actively went out to get the others, so my views on the films are from a film standpoint alone. Deathly Hallows managed to suck me into the world more so than others. No longer are we waiting for our heroes to learn magic spells, they are taking on the bad guys head on. I guess it's true for most series, the darkest is usually the best. Deathly Hallows is probably the darkest Harry Potter film yet because not everyone makes it out alive. That would be a gripe I have though, a lot of the death scenes are only mentioned or give a brief second on screen. We are with characters we've known from films as far back as the beginning, so I would have liked a little bit more reflection on certain death scenes. Harry has lost his mentor. He must grow up and make decisions for himself, become more of a leader. The amount of time, care and love put into crafting these films are clearly evident. One only has to look at the recent rushed attempts of the Twilight series to see that the studio and filmmakers are more keen on cashing in on the craze then adapting a story to screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone came out ten years ago. This is a franchise that, despite the books not being completed yet, wants to tell an epic story. It took the books ten years to tell the story, so it takes the films ten as well. Deathly Hallows is a great beginning to the end.",8,0,3,12 April 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," A Horrific, Grotesque, Intense & Above All Fun Ride Through These Hills.
","In this remake, we see the family trip take a horrible turn as a mutated family living in the hills in a remote desert take a family hostage. The mutants are bent on revenge and will stop at nothing for blood and carnage. I've yet to see Craven's original, so I can't really compare this remake to it. Although, from what I've heard this remake is far better. If I had seen the original, I would probably agree. Alexandre Aja, who brought us a little french film called 'High Tension' is at the blood and guts genre again. This time he has more people to slaughter and a great team behind him to bring these horrific mutants to life. What we as an audience get is a sick, twisted, no holds barred horror film that isn't afraid to smack the viewer in the face. With so many horror films playing it 'safe' in the recent years, Hills Have Eyes is a nice breath of fresh air in the horrors of the horror genre.Alexandre Aja and co manage to create such a creepy and isolated atmosphere, that if there were no mutants at all I would still get the creeps. The hills play characters themselves, as the home to these creatures, they too are frightening. The cinematography is too scare people and it does a pretty decent job at that. How is this film different from other horror films out there today? Well, instead of having a guy kill a bunch of teenagers, we have disfigured mutants kills and raping a family. Yup, a family. Yes, there is a rape scene, and while it's not as horrific as some may have it seem be, you still have that uncomfortable feeling when it starts to play out. With the girl getting beaten by her attacker, then raped. While this may seem tame compared to the women beating of 'Ichi The Killer', this film if more mainstream, so you can sense of surprised face when I saw it.There are two scenes that are the highlights of Hills, one is when the mutants first attack the family, which is where the rape takes place. The second is when one of the family members goes to the mutants 'home' and is basically a killing machine. I can watch the most horrific thing happen to a human being, but when an animal gets hurt, that's when it hits me. Yes, a dog dies in this film, but the other dog makes up for it by kicking some major ass. The blood and gore? Plenty. One to keep the gore hounds happy. Hills showcases a mix of CGI and prop deaths. Along with the effects from the brilliant minds of KNB (oldschool Evil Dead, I love these guys). Seeing the mutants is fun too, even if you can't remember the names of any of them. They are cool to look at and all, but not very memorable. Throughout the film I got a vibe from The Dawn of the Dead remake...mostly from the opening credits, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the films look and feel. Hills is one of the better remakes to come out of the bag in recent years. With other films like The Fog and The Omen appearing, Hills Have Eyes can stand proud to be the best of the bunch. I can see good things from Alexandre Aja in the future of horror.Hills is an excellent horror experience, it has the right amount of creepy scares and more then enough uncomfortable gore. I found the performances to be surprisingly well done for a horror film, that is about mutated cannibals. This film is a horrific, grotesque, intense & above all fun ride through these hills.",8,4,7,12 July 2006
Over the Hedge," 'Hedge Is Better Then The Recent Flood Of Animated Films'
","RJ the raccoon must repay a food debt to a grumpy old bear, Vincent. On his quest for food, he comes across a small family of animals living on the side of a hedge. With no food but tree bark and twigs for the group of animals, RJ takes charge as he cons them into gathering food for hi to give to Vincent.I expected Over The Hedge to join the list of Valiant, Shark Tale and Madagascar as animated films that come and go. While Hedge does take a while to get to the laughs, it's the second half of the film that saves it from being added to that list. It seems that after the success of Toy Story back in the day and Shrek being noticed as a film to bring the animated films out of the closet, many actors are jumping at the chance to add their voices to the colourful characters of animation. Hedge is packed with many big names, who's voices all work perfectly with the characters. Carell is perfect as the always on the go squirrel and Shanter is genius as the always playing dead possum. The animation is better then expected, with the fur on the tails and the blades of grass all looking very impressive. The only downfall lies within the humans. Much like Toy Story, they humans in this film look amateurish to me. Dwayne, the verminator, looks like he should be voiced by someone like Patrick Warburton, but Church did an honest job at it.Running under 90 minutes, the film does come and go pretty quickly. It leaves one to think that they could have done so much more with the film. With a slow start, it would seem that Hedge is not really going anywhere, but with the second half of the film, mainly the house raid, Hedge is able to move ahead of the pack. I was surprised by the amount of laughs it got out of me. Hedge is definitely better then the recent flood of animated films, and you'll be glad you gave it a chance.",7,1,1,17 August 2006
Wanted," Extravagant, That's For Sure.
","The film never really grabbed me from the trailers. It was simply taking the action genre to another level of absurdity. That's exactly what I expected and exactly what I got. I did have fun, but was left unfulfilled by the end of it. It was immature and inane in a lot of parts and the wow factor never really got me. It was all done in the trailers, leaving an empty film for us viewers to watch.It has the beautiful Jolie, who after a handful of serious roles is able to relax and have fun here. She is Laura Croft with a more bad ass attitude and sexy tattoos. James McAvoy tries his best as the leading man, he does a decent job, but fails to have any connection with Jolie. Terence Stamp is hardly in the movie to really comment on him and Morgan Freeman takes a different role here as the baddie. Without a doubt, he has the best line of the film...No, the best line of 2008. His delivery is hilarious and frightening at the same time.I've seen Nightwatch and see the same hyper style here. It's something that I expect to see a lot more of from him, it may get tiring fast for some people.I never heard of the GN before the film and didn't think anything that wasn't popular would be turned into a film. This film proved me wrong. Twists and turns happen here, all for predictable and some of really aggravating. Specifically what Jolie does at the end. Anyway, I can recommend the film simply on a pure entertainment, never take a single frame of this film seriously type way.",7,5,11,20 July 2009
Apocalypse Now," Overly Long and Overrated?
","The Redux version of Apocalypse Now is just way too long. There I said it.The hellish road to get this film made is not a secret. The film turned out to be a success and people described it as the most honest depiction of war put to film, until Private Ryan came along that is.My views on the film are different, because the only version I have seen is the Redux one. I apparently have a knack for watching the lesser version of supposedly great films. Redux is a good film, hurt by those added scenes, or so I'm told. I can say this though, what was cut for the original film should have remained on the cutting room floor. We get it, the French were there, did we really need to spend all that time with them.Just when I found myself getting interested in the film it began to bore me, again I'm mainly talking about the French Plantation scene. This added nothing to the overall arc of the film and just stalled the viewer getting to the final climax. Suffice to say I'll place my money on saying this, Apocalypse Now is a better film if it were left alone.It's a flawed film that inches on greatness. Memorable characters with real life problems? Awesome, I'm there. A cast that work well together and embody the characters? Even better. The film is epic and sits near the top of the important films of our history. Redux doesn't ruin a classic film, it just makes it boring.Coppola is far from a favourite director of mine. I find his films overly long and tedious. He is talented, no doubt about that and deserves his place, but to me he should have left Apocalypse alone and not George Lucas it up. Pretentious or not, you decide.I would still love to see the original though.",8,0,2,20 July 2009
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," 'Virgin Is Without A Doubt, The Funniest Comedy In Years.'
","Andy Stitzer is a toy collector, who plays video games, rides a bicycle to work and has never had sex. When his co-workers need a fifth poker buddy they ask Andy to join in on the fun. After some raunchy sex talk they discover that Andy is in fact a virgin and they make it their mission to get Andy laid. When Andy meets a beautiful woman who is divorced and has kids, he falls in love, and finds it hard to keep his virginity a secret.Steve Carell is a funny guy, you have probably noticed him in many comedic films as the asshole, Bruce Almighty, the creepy guy, Achorman, and loser, Sleepover. In virgin he wrote the material, so he knows how to play the character perfectly. With it's R rating, Carell and co were able to let anything fly in terms of their sexual innuendos.Judd Apatow has his directorial debut with Virgin, his previous work including off beat comedy Undeclared and Freaks and Geeks. When the director and actor both write the film and both get what is funny about it, it makes it a lot easier to connect to the audience. It is a raunchy movie. The sex jokes are everywhere, the swearing is everywhere. But it all fits in this movie. Carell is so innocent in the movie, so seeing him curse so much is odd in a funny way. Catherine Keener looks and performance good in this film, but it's Carell's friends that are funny.The film has many comedic highlights, unlike other comedy films that may contain only one or two. Birgin manages to keep the laughs coming and each time they do, they get longer and louder. Carell wax chest scene had me in tears and the fact that everyone knows that it was real made it even funnier. Seeing the reactions from the actors in the room was priceless and Carells 'cursing' was hilarious. Another highlight was Carell trying to put on the condoms. He has trouble of course cause he has never had sex. So when the condom snaps and hits him in the penis you can't help but laugh. To add icing to the cake the kids enter and see the 'used' condoms on the bed and ask how many times they did it. The ending song credits is one of the funniest moments, if you know where the joke is.Virgin is indeed the funniest movie of 2005. It is hilarious and has a good message about abstinence. The only downfall of the film would be it's running time, it goes over 2 hours and they could have easily cut some of the material out. During the film I had mixed emotions about the length, at first I did not want it to end, then I was thinking to myself, this is a long movie. Carell's talent in other films and the office were not really noticed. Now that he has a successful film under his belt, his previous work will be acknowledge and his future projects will be plenty. I'm for one glad to see new faces in comedy rising and hopefully others will be fading, Sandler and Stiller.In the end, Virgin is the laugh out loud comedy of the year and you should definitely check it out if not for the laughs, then for the message.",8,1,2,5 January 2006
Face_Off," Cage/Travolta switch roles........brilliant.
","John Woo is the so called master of action films, where he puts heavy on the action and light on the characters, he does this again with FACE/Off, but what makes this film different is the fact that the characters actually switch roles in it, which makes it more interesting then his previous 'american films'.We see the actors brilliantly display hate/love and imitate each other. Without this element, this film would probably fall flat on it's face in the action genre and become a fading memory, instead of making it's mark in film Other then the fact that they switch roles, what makes this film different from it's other rivals? Not that much, it's your typical gun fights here, explosions there, chase scene here, but does that mean that it makes it not enjoyable? Certainly not. There are tons of scenes where the bullets fly for those action hounds and of course the movie has the signature double gun from hard boiled and Woo's birds flying away. Woo has a talented eye for action, but not very much for characters, does that harm this film, a little, but again with the fact that the actors in it, portray different personalities, you don't really get a sense of that, you feel for the character of Archer and his dead son. CAGE, who is a personal fav, gives a great performance, but it's TRAVOLTA, the 'bad guy' who gets the glory in this film for having a fun time.The story is laughable, but fun and that's what this movie is, pure fun. It does have emotional parts of it, but it does little for people who go to see this movie, unless your a sappy person who cries at the death of everybody. The ending is a little inane, but forgivable in this film. It could have had a better ending, which would have made the film go down in history as a great action film, instead of a fun action film, which is what so many action films are like today.",8,1,2,27 May 2005
Jarhead," 'Welcome To The Suck...OORAH'
","Jarhead (the self-imposed moniker of the Marines) follows Swoff, a third-generation enlistee, from a sobering stint in boot camp to active duty, sporting a sniper's rifle and a hundred-pound ruck on his back through Middle East deserts with no cover from intolerable heat or from Iraqi soldiers, always potentially just over the next horizon. Swoff and his fellow Marines sustain themselves with sardonic humanity and wicked comedy on blazing desert fields in a country they don't understand against an enemy they can't see for a cause they don't fully fathom.Jarhead is a war movie that actually doesn't have that much war shown in the film. Without any political statements to make, Jarhead simply tells the story of a solider in the war, who desperately wants to kill someone, something, anything. In order to let the madness go away from the unsettling nervousness one would have in a situation like this. So don't see this movie to see some politics because Sarsgaard said it best. 'F*ck politics...it's all bull****, it doesn't matter. We're here now.' The opening of the film is brings us back to the day when we first saw a film titled 'Full Metal Jacket' and while the rest of the film also makes a comparison to it, it is able to distinguish itself as refreshing.What makes Jarhead so interesting to watch is not the fact that they have to battle an enemy, but rather themselves when they have no one to kill. When your sent to war with all the training and skills to kill an individual and are not able to, it will make you go crazy. So when the opportunity finally comes up for Swoff he jumps at the chance, although when that opportunity is taken away from him at the last second, the sniper scouter, Troy, literally breaks down. This is the stress that the soldiers must constantly go through every day out there. For the soldiers there are only a few outlets for this stress.Gyllenhaal has the usual soldier goes crazy scene, but here it is compelling and not clich√©d. You do not know what the outcome will be, which surprisingly is unique. Then again it could be the fact that Gyllenhaal plays crazy so well...Donnie Darko anyone? From here till the Oscars, I'll wear my Sarsgaard for Supporting Actor Pin. For a character who says welcome to the suck every ten minutes, Sarsgaard is able to give a charismatic and electric performance. Foxx plays the prick drill Sargent, he's rough and crude and plays it to a tee. While Foxx has the flashier supporting part, it's Sarsgaard who is more gripping and will ultimately get the recognition.Mendes has a few 'artistic' shots, that are pleasing to the eye. Like the shadows of two soldiers sitting in front of a red/orange sunset, or a soldier standing, while the oil burns behind him.Powerful and humorous is what Jarhead is, and it can join fight club on the list of guy movies. When every soldier watches the most famous scene from Apocalypse Now, you get pumped up yourself. You get attached to these soldiers and when the one soldier watches 'Deer Hunter', you can't help but feel the sorrow that he feels. Or even when Gyllenhaal gets the unexpected 'welcome home' from his girlfriend.With the final 10 minutes of the film, it tries to throw an emotional punch at you, but misses. It would have hit, if it were not in a montage, but centred more on the topic at hand. If it does punch you, it's a light one because it comes and goes so fast. With no explanation at all. Jarhead is a movie with powerful performances and a great eye behind the camera. It's raw realism owes itself to the book that it was based on. Jarhead goes into the category as one of the few movies that makes me want to read the material that it was made from.",8,2,3,12 November 2005
Shrek Forever After," Pointless addition, but is better than third.
","My biggest problem with this so called final installment is the fact that the entire movie does not need to exist. The plot itself is something that screams 'no more creativity'. Let's take a look shall we? Shrek feels empty inside as he has to do the same old chores over and over again, his life has become so redundant he ends up hating it. He wants things to go back to the way they were before he became and father, met Fiona and knew any of his friends. He wants to be a lonely Ogre again. So he makes a deal with Rumpelstiltskin and he gets his wish. Now we are thrust into an alternate reality where he never met Fiona, Donkey, or his friends. There is a catch though, if he doesn't kiss Fiona before a certain time, he is stuck in this alternate reality. He now must get Fiona to fall in love with him again in order to put things back to the way they were before he was tricked. To me, once you are telling stories about alternate realities and what ifs...you know the series is done for. For some strange reason they all thought there was one more left in them, sadly the answer is no. I will say this though, the 4th one is indeed better than the garbage known as Shrek the Third, but that isn't saying much. It fails to capture the magic that the first one had, or even the second, which I am also not a big fan of. To me, Shrek was always a one film story. Three sequels later, we are treated to a slowly dying franchise. The animation is great, as always, if still a bit behind Pixar outings. The kids will no doubt be entertained by it, it's colourful enough to keep their attention, which seems to be the case with every kids movie. It's the adults that have to see it with them (or on their own) who will be the disappointed ones.",5,4,6,28 March 2011
Dark City," Underrated Brilliant Film.
","Dark City is all about a man who has incredible powers but doesn't realize it. Everyone is under the control of mysterious 'strangers' who are injecting them with false memories/altering their reality. This man (Rufus Sewell) finally confronts these men in a battle for the city.This is one of those films that inspires you to learn more about sci/fi. The whole movie is cold, dark and it never lights up for a minute. This movie is an underrated brilliant sci-fi film and it bares a resemblance to 'The Matrix', but was made before it, so there is no denying that Dark City must have been an inspiration for The Matrix.The story is complex but develops itself as a frequently entertaining thriller. It is thought provoking, which is a lesser thing you'll find in films today. You'll sit there thinking about life after viewing this film. It can easily been our future if we head down the road we are on.The performances are all very good, specially the three lead men. Rufus Sewell plays the confused lead, William Hurt plays the film noir detective and Kiefer Sutherland is the quirky side switching doctor. Don't forget Jennifer Connellywho plays the role with great expertise. Alex Proyas much like The Crow has created this Gothic world where the sun never rises and inhabitants live in darkness. The sets and costumes are beautiful. The acting is top-of-the-line, with Sewell in the lead part. Everyone does a great job.The villains in this film, THE STRANGERS, are creepy and will send chills down your spine every time you see them in their long black coats and hat. The costumes for them are perfect and could not have been done better, they live in the world underground and you see the different lifestyles between them and the people they control, yet live above them.The thing that amazed me the most would be the cross between the 1950 to 1980's, it was brilliant, the set pieces were perfect for this film. Every time I saw the buildings changing, I was in amazement. Everyone that took part in this film should be praised, this is a film that should get more attention from the general public, but is overshadowed by films that like to put more action then story in it's plot.",10,174,215,14 February 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man," Is it really amazing?
","The biggest hurdle this film has to jump is that it can't seem like a cash grab to keep the studio owning the rights to the character before it reverts back to Marvel. So the question I ask myself and I ask those who've seen it. Did it feel like this movie needed to be made, or more importantly, does this story need to be told again only ten years after Sam Raimi's Spiderman? The answer, for me, is no. The problem is the film treads familiar ground for too long, we've seen this story before. What does this film offer that differs from the original series? Well, the main thing is that his parents are more present and that gives a mysterious element to the film. Clearly all a ploy to set up a new trilogy. There are a lot of things introduced into this film that scream sequel. It's a thin ice, on one hand it will ultimately serve the viewer better down the road...if they care to continue the journey. At the end of the day, the feeling that I got with this film was this: an excuse to keep the franchise at Sony. One of the biggest missteps this film has is the relationship between Gwen Stacey and Peter Parker. The fault lies within the script and the chemistry between the two. On their own, they are both great, together, it's a mess. I never bought the relationship from the set-up, to the conclusion. It felt forced and when they were together, I was asking myself why do they seem so awkward on screen? So the casting works on varying levels. Leary is given little to do, but this isn't his story anyway, then we have Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors a role that was played by Dylan Baker in every Raimi Spiderman film. Had Baker been the villain in the 3rd Spiderman, maybe we'd be enjoying their fourth collaboration and not this revamp. Ifans relationship to Peter in this film is lacking and his turn to the villain is underwhelming. There are scenes that feel ripped out of the original, specifically Connors battling his inner self exactly like Dafoe as the Green Goblin. It felt out of place as it only happened I think once, maybe twice. I never really found Spiderman to be in any danger during this film. We have a giant lizard creature attacking him and I never felt any suspense. This leads into another fault of the film.The action sequences are messy. Not once did I think 'Oh, that was cool/interesting/neat/new/inventive' anything along those lines. Marc Web (yes, his last name is Web) was the wrong man for the job. He had a brilliant debut film 500 Days of Summer and I figure Sony was trying to go the Marvel route and try out more 'unconventional' directors for the gig. Yet his inexperience shows a bit with the action sequences, all of them lack the thrills the original trilogy had. So where does this film succeed? As I said before, when they are not on screen together, both Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are quite good. The scenes showcasing Spiderman swinging through the city are huge improvements over the original trilogy. They look real, feel real and he moves like the character would in the comics. I surprisingly liked the more realistic feel to this one. It works for and against it at times. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there is a bit of mystery added to the overall story here. Peter's father, his story and his relation to future possible villains in something that I am actually looking forward to. Despite feeling underwhelmed with the entire production, it does feel a bit more polished than a thrown together superhero film. This is no Iron Man 2. But I would have much rather of seen another Raimi entry, a redeeming entry to the 3rd, than this one. This would probably be on par with the original Spiderman, but the question of whether or not this particular story, one which we are way too familiar with, should it have been told again? My answer is no.",7,0,2,7 August 2012
The Lego Movie," A Must See - Hilariously Entertaining.
","Emmet is a nobody. He is so normal and boring that even people he thinks are his friends don't remember him. He lives his life by the instructions, but one day he goes off the beaten path and finds himself deemed 'the special one' by a rebel group hellbent on bringing an end to evil dominance in the land.I had heard of good things from the film, I just didn't expect to cry from laughter. The Lego Movie is my kind of humour, fast paced, sometimes stupid, completely random and chaotic. The Lego Movie is all this wrapped in a beautifully created lego world that will have you smiling at all the little pieces that make up the brilliance of the animation. A must see film that is consistently funny and entertaining from start to finish. Bring the whole family. The story involves in the old tale of an ordinary guy mistaken for some kind of hero, then he learns to trust in himself and finds the courage to become the hero the people thought he originally was. Nothing really new in terms of storytelling, but the presentation, the uniqueness of the art and the witty humour make for one tremendous ride from start to finish. The film feels like it never stops from the get go. Constantly on hyper speed, the pace never drags and the kids will never be bored. Filled to the brim with voice acting, Chris Pratt leads the film with Elizabeth Banks playing the romantic interest. Supporting roles include Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, Charlie Day, Allison Brie, Nick Offerman, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and dozens of others in smaller cameo roles all fit the bill nicely. The imaginative landscape is truly inspiring here. Thrust into different lego worlds we'll be in the Wild West at one point, then stuck on a Pirate Ship the next. Despite the film being entirely CGI, you'll swear to yourself that half the film must have been done with actual legos. The attention to detail is awe inspiring. The Lego Movie is indeed hilarious and a must see. It's early in the new year, but I expect this to be the best animated film this year. Can't wait for the sequel.",8,0,2,25 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," One Of The Series Best
","With Singer back in the fold, many people felt like the series was back in good hands. He comes back after the failed attempt at reviving the Superman franchise and a battle of a fairy tale, Jack The Giant Killer. Those two projects seemed to fail with critics and audiences alike, so Singer is back to the films that made him a household name. I would personally like to see another small scale film like Apt Pupil or The Usual Suspects, but the guy has a visual eye that blends well with the big budget scaled films, so I'll take him here. Singer opens with a well choreographed fight between mutants and their new enemy, the Sentinels. Some neat powers are introduced, such as portals used by a new mutant Blink, which aid in the fight against these mutant killing machines. Once we get passed the explosive opening, we are given the set up, Logan must travel back in time and change the future. Some expository dialogue from Xavier and we are on our way back to the 70's.Now, for people wanting to know where we are in the X-Men timeline. The past sequences are after the events of First Class, so the rift between Erik and Charles is present, but it is before the events of X-Men Origins, so before Logan has his adamantium. He's stuck with his bone claws here and in a surprising turn of events, we hardly get to see him use them. While a lot of the other films were 'Wolverine' heavy, DOFP seems to be more of an ensemble piece, giving equal time to much deserving characters. A new addition, Peter AKA Quicksilver, has the most memorable sequence in the film and his scenes again, show the visual excitement that Singer brings back to the franchise. In the past, Logan has to convince Xavier to help him, but he has lost the use of his powers due to an experimental drug he uses developed by Hank McCoy (Beast) that gives him the ability to walk again. Xavier is stuck in a depressed isolated place, he's lost his friend Erik, Raven has abandoned him, the school is shut down. He's not in a good place. Logan has to do for him what Xavier did for Logan back in the original films. Help him find his way. McAvoy isn't afraid to let the character, who is almost always calm, cool, collected and smart...with more of an edge. He's lost, he's refusing to acknowledge his power exists. Magneto on the other hand is in prison. People claim he is responsible for the assassination of JFK and they need to bust him out. They still don't see eye to eye and Fassbender brings the angry hostility that a young man with a lot of power would have. He wants to be the superior species whether he is or not. His plan in't the same as Logans/Xavier's and the conflict arises. Back in the future, Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Halle Berry, Ellen Page and others are given nothing to do but basically wait. Time is running out for them as Sentinels close in. They try their best to fend them off, but their screen time is a little too short for us to fully invest. Singer relies heavily on previous films for us to care. Most of the conflict is in the 70's. Which look like a far out time to live in. Lava lamps, Vietnam, Nixon, etc. The world Singer creates feels real enough and he follows in the footsteps of First Class director Matthew Vaughn in having mutants be responsible are involved in our real human history. This is a nice touch that pulls the audience in, gives us something more to chew on. As dark as the film is, Singer has just the right amount of light comedy to remind us that we are watching a comic book film. A wink and a nod here and there are welcomed, especially those who are fans of the comics and know certain character relations. DOFP is exciting, thrilling and one hell of a ride. I'd place this entry up there with X-2. It tries to mend the broken bones that was left behind from Ratner and his Last Stand, which was a poorly written, visual disaster. Yet DOFP falters in some areas, mostly in the continuity round. First Class screwed up a lot in the continuity department with the other films. Certain character relationships, history, plot, etc. Last Stand screwed things up with unemotional character deaths and juggling of two awesome stand alone story lines into one big mess. DOFP doesn't feel like it has to answer some important questions. Like, how does Wolverine has adamantium claws in the future, who know from the events of The Wolverine he doesn't. How does Xavier still have his body? he transferred consciousness in the end of Last Stand. Who built cerebro? Two conflicting answers. Why does Logan have white hair when he 'doesn't age' but everyone else looks the exact same age. Some interesting things I thought to myself was when Logan goes back in time, Xavier is depressed...he hasn't changed the past yet, so what was it that originally brought him out of his funk to form the x-men? Why is his relationship with Mystique so important now, but never mentioned in the other films? Chalk this up to oversight when the originals were made, but it would still be nice to see them correct this mess in the film. It seems they wanted to hit a big RESET button, which they did, but I still have my questions, questions I feel will never be answered, but that's just the film student comic geek in me talking. DOFP is THE summer blockbuster of this year and one helluva good time.",8,1,3,1 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," 'I'm doing what has to be done... to save us from something worse.'
","Superhero fatigue is a problem that many people think is starting to settle in. Fantastic Four was an abysmal film and it made less than Spy Kids 3D: Game Over. Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice received terrible reviews and had one of the biggest Friday to Sunday drops. Are people sick of these films? Well, not if you're in the Marvel family it seems. For one thing, Marvel actually takes pride and careful attention to detail with their films, both the previously mentioned titles are rush jobs for specific reasons. Civil War is proof that the good guy vs good guy aspect of superhero films can be done right.The world wants to hold the Avengers accountable for all the death and destruction they've caused over the years, so the United Nations put together the Sokovia Accords, which means the Avengers would work for them. Tony Stark supports this. Steve Rogers does not. Things get more complicated when Bucky turns up again and is the prime suspect in a bombing that kills dozens of people. With two prominent members of the Avengers on opposing sides of the issue, will the team ever be the same again?Civil War has a lot going for it. Stellar cast, great characters, top-notch special effects, excellent action sequences, comedic relief and...well the list goes on. The Russo brothers have delivered a slick action film that makes me comfortable with the fact that they seem to be at the helm of the Marvel franchise now. When The Avengers was first announced, I thought it was going to be dreadful, then they said these guy named Joss Whedon was going to be directing it and my expectations instantly changed. Whedon delivered a great superhero film that set up the rest of the films to come. The Russo brothers now have the task of juggling all these characters and they do an admirable job.Each character has their shining moments, but the core of the story is Stark vs Rogers. So while it's fun to have Rudd come in and have a few laughs, I don't think anyone is expecting huge things from his character. Same with Spider-Man, who is forced in here to set up his future films within this weird shared universe with Sony. Those are not complaints, they both work wonderfully in the film. If I were to find a complaint it would be in the thought process of the villain, Zemo. His plan is so painstakingly convoluted that I wonder how it even worked at all. Too many things need to fall in place for him to get what he wants and it distracts from the emotional power of the climax. The actors and the history with the characters manage to save it a bit and do raise the stakes, but I had my problems nonetheless.The grand spectacle at the airport between these characters was indeed a highlight. When you have characters like Vision and Scarlet Witch, who are so powerful they could end the fight instantly, it's a good idea to have them simply do damage control. I wondered how they would handle these two, they did a decent job of it. After this film, I can only hope that Infinity Wars goes this route and gives each Avenger a worthy foe to fight and not a hoard of mindless foot soldiers, which is exactly what the previous two Avengers films did. Fans of the series will be pleased, the action is great (a bit shaky at first, but they let it breath later on) and some great introductions of new characters that will bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. Black Panther for one, steals a lot of the scenes he is in. Bold move to have such a big character 'show up' in the film without a solo movie to set him up, but it works here. The cast is diversifying as more and more characters come into these films and I'm glad to see it. Tony Stark is great, RDJ does a great job with him, but we've seen the guy have a big role in these films 6 times now. I get that Marvel is scared to let some of these characters go because they are so integral to everything, but I honestly believe something along these lines needs to happen to bring more emotional depth to the franchise. For a studio willing to take chances are projects like Guardians of the Galaxy, they need to take a chance on this aspect as well.",8,28,45,20 May 2016
Saw III," 'SAW III Tries To Piece Back Together Missing Pieces In The Jigsaw'
","Jigsaw, who is on his deathbed, gets his apprentice Amanda to kidnap a doctor, who is told to keep him alive or she will die. Meanwhile Jeff is the next person to fall victim to Jigsaw's game.When choosing to see a horror film, one should not listen to what the film critics have to say about it. Usually they will tear the film a new one, simply because they're not a fan, or appreciate the genre. Horror is a genre for its fans, not it's critics. It's no surprise that the critics hate the third Saw film, but the fans rejoice around it. While Saw III is not the best film of the trilogy, it's not the worst either. Improving over the mess of a sequel that was Saw II, Saw III tries to piece back together missing pieces in the jigsaw and succeeds at doing so...barely.While many thought that Jigsaw himself died at the conclusion of the second film, we were all wrong. He's still alive and kicking, well not kicking, but alive. It's up to Lynn, a doctor to keep him alive, for her sake. She is attached to a device that will blow up is Jigsaw's heart rate stops and she leaves his proximity. Sounds very 'Battle Royalish'. She is only a small part of a much bigger game that Jigsaw is playing. In a couple rooms over another victim wakes in a wooden box, this is Jeff. He is unwillingly (like everyone else) thrown into this game of life or death. His so called crime; according to Jigsaw is his inability to let go of the past. A car killed his son and Jeff has yet to let go of this, so he is sent on this 'quest' to get to the man who killed his son. He must choose to forgive and save three victims, who all have their hand in his son's death, or let them die. Eventually all of this somehow leads up to the films end where it throws it's expected twist, which isn't as good as either of the previous films.Saw II didn't go over so well because it took a different angle, and failed. SAW III does the exact same thing, yet somehow gets away with it, by an inch mind you. What made the original so compelling and unique was that it took place in this dirty bathroom. In the sequels, it's multiple rooms. This is a double edge sword; while it's neat to want to see what crazy contraption Jigsaw has in for us behind door number one, two or three...there is no real sense of urgency, or confinement. Jeff makes his way through room-to-room trying to save the victims, which include drowning in chopped up pig stuff, being frozen to death and being twisted to death, yup I said twisted.The film picks up exactly where the second film left off, you could basically splice the two films together and watch one long bloody film, no pun intended. We see Eric, the detective from the second film chained up in the same bathroom; he tries everything to escape his chains and finally comes up with an answer. No, he doesn't saw off his foot like Dr. Gordon, he smashes it with the toilet cover and then breaks it. That was the one and only squirm in my seat moment for me, as the rest if really just blood and guts. Yes, Saw III is the bloodiest of them all; You'll get foot smashing as I mentioned, heads exploding, bodies twisting, freezing, suffocating...so on. SAW III uses flashbacks to show us things that we didn't know about the first two films, such as the fact the Amanda has been in on it since the whole Dr. Gordon and Adam fiasco. She even killed Adam, instead of him starving which is what we were led to believe. Still to mention of what happened to Dr. Gordon though, but I'm sure we can all agree on him dying. Ever wonder why Adam and Gordon never saw Jigsaw breathing, somewhat explained here. These flashbacks seemed like they were here just to cover up plot holes found in the first two films. Yet they work in an odd way. It makes you want to pay more attention, whenever they go back to the previous films, you want to pay attention cause you start to think you may have missed something. Some of the flashbacks may take away from the earlier films, especially with Adams death.The SAW theme music is here yet again, this time with a couple tweaks. It's the new remix, still has same effect, but possibly to a lesser degree. SAW III builds up to it's ending for awhile and once it finally hits you're left sitting there asking yourself if THAT was suppose to be the films huge twist. The twist is okay in it, but doesn't even compare to the sizes of our jaws after watching the first two. More then its blood and guts, it's a story about Jigsaw and Amanda, who become humanized with their emotional connection between the two of them. She cares for him and he cares for her. There were many things that were left not answered here. Like who was the blonde girl in Jigsaw's dream, or what did the letter say that he gave to Amanda, why the hell did he pour hot wax on one of the tapes? Will these be answered in number 4? I don't see how they are going to manage getting another film out, but they probably will. The Saw series will always be torturing new victims as long as we still want it to. Saw III will take you back to the beginning and will please the SAW fans and fans of something bloody, but don't expect to be surprised by their so-called twist at the end, it's a real stinker.",6,0,0,5 November 2006
The Conjuring 2," 'There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile....'
","James Wan is the best horror director working today. The man knows the genre so well that he can easily manipulate the atmosphere to terrorize the viewer. Such a masterful sense of control that he can easily control your fear. With this sequel, Wan has created 3 very successful and engaging horror series. Paranormal Investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren are called to England to investigate whether or not the Enfield family are plagued by deadly spirits or if the family is lying and the whole thing is a hoax. We as the viewer know the truth, we are with this family when the strange occurrences start happening. Yet Wan cleverly depicts such things in a shroud of mystery when the Warren's arrive to make them question if what is happening is real or not. Should they leave thinking it's fake, the terror we feel for the family will be even greater. I believe The Conjuring to be one of the best horror films of the last decade and it's a hard act to follow. Wan tries to up the ante here with the sequel, the scares are more frequent, the demons/ghosts more creepy and the tension is tighter. I still believe the original to be slightly better because it was fresh and the atmosphere was simply brilliant, but Wan does marvellous things with the sequel. Look to any other horror film and the artistic merit fails by comparison. Wan doesn't need blood and guts or even cheap jump scares to make the viewer scared. He simply builds tension, plays with our expectations and uses creative camera techniques to make the film memorable. One particular scene that stands out in my mind is when Ed first interviews Janet, the little girl who is the focus of the terror. The demon/ghost will not communicate unless they look away, so Ed turns his back to Janet. Wan focuses the camera on Ed, while Janet is out of focus in the background. It's one static shot where the out of focus character slowly and eerily changes into the demon/ghost. We never get a good luck at the thing, but we can see enough to know something is eerily off. Effectively creepy with the simplest camera technique. What other horror director would do something like that today? Highly recommended for the horror fan and people who really adore the original. Wan has stepped out of the horror genre and has had success (Fast Seven), but he loves the genre too much to abandon it. The man knows how to direct a horror film and he directs this one extremely well. My one complaint is that the film is long. Clocking in well over 2 hours, it feels like it at times. I'd say to maybe take out one of the scares, but I love each one. Add to the fact that most of the effects are practical and it makes me appreciate the film even more.",8,1,4,15 June 2016
No Strings Attached," Seen this film a hundred times before.
","Guy falls for girl. Girl just wants to have sex. Girl falls for guy but doesn't realize it and screws it up. Girl tries to fix things. Girl and guy fall in love at the end. This plot can be used for 85% of the romantic comedy films that are out there today. Just switch the who falls for who part first and you have your movie. You need one aspect of the film that makes it different and gives the viewer a reason for wanting to see it. This film's reason? Two attractive people using each other for sex. Let the fun begin. No Strings Attached has the benefit of coming out before the carbon copy that is Friends With Benefits. The exact same plot line about people using each other for sex, which causes problems. The dueling films have a bit of irony to them. Natalie Portman stars in No Strings Attached and Mila Kunis stars in Friends With Benefits. So it looks like the duel for the spotlight from Black Swan isn't over and these two films make round 2. No Strings Attached is Ivan Reitman's first R rated comedy since Stripes. The reason the film is rated R is because they use the F-Word a dozen times. Did that make the film funnier? Not really. If a film is rated R for the language, than I think it should use that to the film's advantage, this film didn't do that. The only bits of comedy that I enjoyed were the scenes with Kevin Kline, who plays Ashton Kutcher's father. He's a famous guy who had one successful show and catchphrase. His success draws the attention of one hot young lady, who coincidentally is Kutcher's ex-girlfriend. This revelation sends Kutcher on a drunken spree where he finds himself waking up naked on Portman's couch. They then decide to have sex and use each other for sex whenever, wherever. There is a bit of conflict with this one guy who claims to be the type of guy that Portman would marry, while Kutcher is only the type of guy she has sex with in secret. This drama is never explored, it sets itself up to be nothing in the end. There have been quite a bit of films as of late that follow the trend of the female wanting to use the male for sex while he yearns for something more. Love & Other Drugs did the exact same thing, the problem with that film was that it couldn't balance comedy and drama very well. No Strings Attached has problems finding comedy to balance. Portman is cute, as always. Kutcher is goofy, as always. The supporting cast outshines the main cast, as always. I didn't care if they ended up together in the end. I didn't care about their fights and I didn't care about the hot sex they would have. I simply did not care for this movie. It's clich√©d, generic, cookie-cutter, whatever you want to call it. It's a film that you have seen a dozen times before. The question you need to ask yourself is does the prospect of Kutcher and Portman having nonstop sex interest you?",4,1,2,9 May 2011
Tropic Thunder," Ben Stiller Should Direct More Films
","After a big movie explosion goes wrong (they didn't even film it) the director is talked into taking his actors of the new film tropic thunder, into the real gritty war world. What the actors think are scenes being filmed for the movie is actually drug criminals and real war.Tropic Thunder is a fresh dose of comedy during a time when we have been overloaded with Apatow produced films. Not saying his films are bad, but they do follow a certain path and they all have the same feel. I wanted something different and not something that The House Bunny or the next 'Epic Movie' could offer. Enter Ben Stiller, who has had some trouble as of late with the films he has been in. Tropic Thunder isn't a big change, but it's a refreshing change and one that I welcomed and enjoyed.Ben Stiller's previous directing effort was Zoolander. That film is really hit or miss. I found it to be stupid, yet in a funny way. It knew it was stupid, unlike other films that try to be funny and completely miss the tongue in cheek aspects. Where that film made fun of models, Tropic Thunder makes fun of Hollywood. Frm the hilarious trailers at the start to the way people like agents and producers act behind the scenes. I loved the look of this film, it is almost the total opposite of what and how war films are shot. It's too pretty to be a war film and it works with how these characters live in this world. They are oblivious to most things...even when there is a dead body.The film starts of strong and ends strong as well. It's the middle act where it has most of the problems. Even if you can see the joke coming, you still laugh because of the delivery, good job for the actors on that one. Sure Ben Stiller is paying the same character again, but it works in this film. He manages to make it a little more fresh then stale. I wasn't too impressed with Jack Black, but he does get one of the best jokes in the entire film. (The bit when he is tied to the tree). Robert Downey Jr. is getting the praise here and he deserves it. Being in both Iron Man and Tropic Thunder, in which he steals the entire show, this is his year.The film is more vulgar and violent then I thought it would be. Most of the gore happens in the opening of the film during the filming of the war movie. It is over-the-top and pokes fun at how blood filled war films are. But it may catch peple off guard who are put off by that sort of thing. There is also quite a bit of swearing, but most of it is from a character who isn't involved in the 'war'. While I found both of these aspects funny for the film, others may not. Tropic Thunder is decent, I enjoyed it, was expecting a bit more on the parody of war films, we get Platoon, but where's Deer Hunter? I probably enjoyed it more because it pokes fun at Hollywood and the go around of it all. I tend to gravitate towards that style. All the cameos are great. I don't want to ruin any of them because that would ruin the joke. I can see why some people may not like it, it has been done before and may offend some people. I didn't find any of the Simple Jack bits that funny. While you may not think the film is up to par with more intelligent comedies, it is a nice breath of fresh air.",8,1,5,28 August 2008
Quantum of Solace," Mixes Old Bond With New Bond
","This is the first immediate sequel to any Bond film, so it plays out differently. Here we start just after Casino Royale finishes. Bond questions Mr. White and discovers a secret organization known as Quantum, who have people everywhere. Bond must now go after Dominic Greene, another pawn in Quantum's schemes and this time Bond is fueled by revenge.With every other Bond film, they were able to stand alone since they did not need to rely on the previous installments for someone to know what is going on. This time is different. QoS is the first direct sequel to any Bond film and this does both good and bad for the end results.As I said before Craig is an excellent Bond, one of my favourites. He adds a new layer to a character who was getting boring with the same old same old. This time we see a more dangerous Bond, some might complain that he is starting to resemble Bourne more then Bond, but I don't really mind it too much. Casino Royale showed us where they wanted to take the series and QoS continues down that road, only it stumbles a bit.For one, the action sequences. They are all good and fun, but poorly thrown together. I got a sense of this from the trailers and my thoughts were confirmed with seeing the opening sequence and rooftop chase. I would of liked a better set-up here, throwing us directly into the action is a mis-step. But, at the same time the action sequences screamed classic Bond, which is what was missing from Royale. Here we have the car chases, plane chases and boat chases. Everything seemed like they were updating the older films and it was neat. If they were better edited and directed then I would have enjoyed them more, instead I found myself desperately trying to follow what was going on.The villain wasn't anything special. Mathieu Amalric does a good job with what he is given, but the character is boring, not evil enough and not once did I think this guy was dangerous. I find him to be like a little boy with too much power. Mr. White would have been a better villain, but it seems they are saving that for another time. Olga Kurylenko is beautiful and she looks like she can handle herself, but I wasn't too impressed here. I enjoyed Eva Green a lot more and wanted her back here. Not saying Kurylenko does a bad job, she just isn't that interesting to me.Most of these problems aren't we the actors, but the script. It is muddled with problems in the plot and sometimes is hard to follow. There were a few unnecessary parts and characters, Mathis and Felix Leiter randomly show up and don't do anything of interest. I was disappointed and it seems the series may need a new writer or two to bring fresh and more importantly clear ideas for the next installment.In the end this is a decent flick, it serves as a bridge to what I hope and think will be a better film down the road. It's basically the second half of Casino Royale as well. If you enjoyed Royale, you will like this one, but you won't be enthusiastic about it. I sure wasn't.",7,2,5,15 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," Confident Film-making From The Coen Brothers.
","A man finds 2 million dollars in the desert, after a drug deal goes wrong. He makes the mistake of going back, and it soon chased by other men who knew about the deal. Now it's a game of cat and mouse between him and a hit-man hired to take him out, with the sheriff on both their tails.The Coen Brothers are back to the big screen in this intense blood soaked thriller starring Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem in the lead roles and Tommy Lee Jones plays the Sheriff who's seen too much blood shed in his time. All three give stellar performances, but it's Javier who stands out in the mix, as the heartless psycho killer on the lose. The intensity in his voice is enough to make you squirm. His portrayal of the assassin looking for the money is frightening and along with Bill from the Kill Bill films, one of the best villains of the past decade. Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast, be it seems like no stretch for him. Brolin surprised me, he carried the film very well and did what was needed to be done.There are bits and pieces of dark humour throughout the film, which is a great way to let you relax after the intense moments that are everything else. Even with the bits of comedy here and there, No Country For Old Men is the most mature piece of work from the Coen Brothers. So confidently directed there is no musical score throughout the film. Instead, we are taken directly into this world. We are no longer watching a film, we are apart of the cat and mouse game. Right from the squeaking of shoes on a tile floor of a man being strangled to the beeping of a transmitter signifying impending doom. There is no need for music, the performance speak for themselves.There many intense scenes in this film, one in particular is when we do hear that beeping sound, we anticipate what's going to happen. Great visuals and sounds are used throughout this scene. Along with that audio sound is the visual. An unknown predator lurking in the shadows. We can't seem him, but we can see the bright light from his gun. The cinematography is beautiful. Right from the opening scene, we get a sense of the world these people live on. The open range of the desert.The violence is grounded. You won't see people jumping through the air wielding two guns as doves fly away in slow motion. The villain uses a compressed air tank to break into rooms and kill innocent people. Not only does the villain kill the so called 'bad people', but innocent bystanders as well. The man is so psychotic that he will decide your life by the flip of a coin.With all the good must come the bad. The film is indeed very good, but it can't get over it's own praise. The fault with films like this is that is rarely lives up to it's praise. While this film is indeed good and one of the years best. I wouldn't ranked it up there with films like Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction. No Country for some reason sat odd with me as the credits were rolling. I liked it a lot, but I wanted to like it even more. There was one scene in particular that caught me off guard and I didn't really like, but I can't say what it is without spoiling the film. Also the ending, this is the big discussion of the film. Many people loved the film up until the ending. Well, throw me in the boat as well because I did not dig it very much. The last bit of the film seemed to drag on. The characters had nothing left to do, the story was over, yet the film kept rolling on. It seemed like it was trying to go for some closure, but never really gets there.All in all this film is great and certainly in the top ten films of the year. But, much like the character who can't call the coin for you, because it wouldn't be fair, I can't 'tell' you to go see this movie...you have to call it (or see it) yourself.",8,2,6,22 December 2007
The Love Guru," Horrible Film, Skip It Like The Plague.
","Why is it that the films and the actors from films in the 80's and 90's seem to be so unfunny now that you want to stab yourself in the face with a fork? Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams and now Mike Myers. All these guys need new material and good scripts to get their careers back on track. Please do not go back to Austin Powers, that series has been dried up and The Love Guru is just a rejected character from other ideas. Mike, you're a funny guy, let's see it eh? Jessica Alba does noting here, she is not funny and doesn't use her 'assets' to make me interested. I think she was actually relying on her 'acting' skills on this one. I never thought I would actually ever say this but, I was happy to see Justin Timberlake in this. He had some good moments of comedy, a lot funnier then Myers. Mike, the former N*Sync boy toy just stole the film from you.Myers uses same old material, recycled and coming from a different 'approach'. You know how Goldmember used the same jokes as The Spy Who Shagged Me? Same stuff here, just in a different format. More short jokes at mini-me, more sexual innuendos with names and a wink at the camera here and there. Same old stuff we've seen before.The scenes where the characters are playing hockey aren't even that good. They don't represent the game in any sense of realism. Guys are spinning and flipping everywhere. Usually sport scenes are thrilling, this one was a joke. The funniest bit involved the one and only VAL KILMER, who is in it for 5 seconds.I guess if you think two elephants doing it is funny, then you'll enjoy this. for everyone else, just keep on keeping on.What a horrible way to start the year off.",2,0,6,20 July 2009
District 9," One Of This Years Best.
","District 9 has been getting a lot of hype and praise to equal that hype. Not many films can do this. I decided that I would try my best to go into this film not knowing much about it. I've seen the teaser and a couple TV spots and knew the basic premise. What I did not know was what a balls to the wall film this is.Neill Blomkamp has mixed great sci/fi with themes and issues plaguing our society. A blend that works so well in this film that it plays out in two different styles. The first half of the film is told through a documentary style footage, with people talking directly to the camera explaining the backstory of the mothership and basically setting up the rest of the film. Half way through the film Blomkamp switches the style to a more conventional style of film-making, yet it isn't a jarring switch. The two styles bleed into each other and both feel the same.The film is set in South Africa, the aliens are sequestered into these slums and blocked off away from humans. This segregation is reminiscent of our own history and it works well here, making the film more believable than a film like Independence Day. While watching this film I got a sense of Cloverfield and some Slumdog Millionaire. I wouldn't say it's a mix of the two, but I just got the feeling from it. I saw Cloverfield because this is a sci/fi that we haven't seen before. It's not based on anything and the creators have free range to do what they want. This was apparent in all the awesome weaponry they had. Cloverfield was new, fresh and a monster that we had no idea what it could do. I had no idea what this film was about to do, which was blow me away.The second half, which is the more conventional film-making style, is action-packed and bloody violent. I had no idea what I was in for, but once I saw that the lead got his hands on the weapon technology, I had a huge smile on my face. What he did with it, made me smile even more. There were plenty of 'Holy Sh*t' moments on my end. The most fun I've had at the movies this year, even more than the other sci/fi entertainer Star Trek.The film is gritty, dirty and everything that it needs to be to sell this idea. The special effects look marvelous, especially when placed on such a desolate and depressing backdrop. The slums are dirty and turn into a warzone. A warzone that goes on for a long time and you never get tired of. You end up wanting more, craving more.For a film with no star names attached and a lead who hasn't acted in anything before, I was surprised in the depth and emotion that these characters had and what Sharlto Copley had to offer. He's between a rock and a hard place. His character transformation from beginning to end is real and saddening. It's not easy to get me to care for CGI creatures, George Lucas failed, Peter Jackson succeeds, again. The alien creatures look great and I was surprised at how well I was able to connect to the Christopher character.The film is original, fresh and unexpected. I was never bored and had no idea what was going to happen next. In all this action and drama, is there any room for some sweet romantic moments? The answer is yes and it ends on a beautiful note.Go see this one in theatres.",9,6,13,15 August 2009
Batman Begins," 'Batman Makes His Dark and True Return, Without Schumacher.'
","As a young boy, Bruce Wayne watched in horror as his parents were killed right in front of him, which leads him to become obsessed with revenge. Leaving Gotham, Bruce Wayne seeks counsel with the dangerous but honorable ninja cult leader Ra's Al-Ghul, Bruce returns to his now decaying Gotham City, which is overrun by organized crime. The discovery of a cave under his mansion, along with a prototype armored suit, leads him to assume a new persona, one which will strike fear into the hearts of men who do wrong; he becomes Batman.What the makers of Batman Begins wanted to do was to make the audience forget about those Bat Nipples, those bright neon streets and horrible puns made by horribly casted villains. Nolan and co have not only brought the franchise back to life by obliterating Schumachers version, but to some have out-done Burtons classic Gothic original.Written by David. S. Goyer and under the direction of Nolan, who has done no wrong in the directing chair, Batman becomes what he originally was in the comic books. With this new fresh start we see how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, and in doing so, we get a more human and round character of Batman, unlike in the former series. More true to the comic books then Burtons and more entertaining then Schumachers, this Batman is able to regain the fans it once lost...and gain some new ones.Nolan doesn't throw action at us from the start like the latter films do, it takes it's time to build up emotion and the character of Bruce Wayne. For those who actually did enjoy Schumachers mess, will find this movie a tad slow and boring, because Bale doesn't become Batman till half way through the picture. It's safe to say that the best Bruce Wayne is Bale hands down, he is able to bring both characteristics from Keaton's and Kilmer's style, to make this Bruce Wayne perfect. While some may not be digging the whole Batman voice, it's actually more true to the comics then the others have done. Batman is suppose to have a dark harsh voice.Some of the fight sequences were hard to follow are not all that entertaining, the two that pop into my mind would be the first fight in the prison, the editing is so fast and the camera is too close up for people to actually see what's going on. The second fight sequence is when Batman goes into the city and fights the 'henchmen' ninjas, it seemed to slow paced and not hard hitting enough. Other then that, the action sequences were very entertaining and for the most part, better then the other Batman films. The Batmobile chase scene is a sensation for the eyes to watch.This Batman film has the best performances of any other, Bale is the new Bruce Wayne/Batman and he knows what works and what doesn't. Murphy is delightfully evil and eccentric in his performance of The Scarecrow, this is the best performance in the film. Murphy is an underrated actor, who will eventually get more and more recognition. Oldman is one of the best bad guy actors, so seeing him in a new refreshing role really shows his diversity. Neeson is able to show his experience through this role, he acts as a teacher to the others in his performance. He knows what to do and gets to the point. Wilkinson, with his little screen time, is able to stand out as a high point. Good performances all around from Freeman, Cain and Hauer.Now, I was a huge fan of the old Alfred and the new one seems a little to energetic to me, Cain was good, but I just got the sense of miscasting here. I can see the role being played by an unknown actor and it would have worked better. Katie Holmes of course was a weak point, her character seemed to have no emotional attachment/chemistry with Bruce Wayne, and Holmes to Bale for that matter. She is so out of place in this style of film, and Wantanabe basically stands there and says a couple lines, nothing more.The film is a great restart for a new franchise, which is undoubtedly going to get better and better with such villains as The Joker and The Riddler, hopefully done right this time. With the great cast and director in the same positions, I see BATMAN on a scale higher then that of Spiderman and X-men.",8,1,2,28 October 2005
Twilight," Hard To Watch.
","Why did I watch this film you might ask. I never read the books and it's not my style. If I know I won't like a film, I at least give it a chance, it could have some redeeming factors. If it's well made I note it, well acted, so on etc. I watched this with a buddy of mine. We had a good laugh.The film is pretty bad. Let's start off with the cast.Stewart is alright, she plays a wooden character who falls in love with this guy, played by Pattinson, who is a vampire. You know he's a vampire because when he hits the sunlight....he glitters. I'm not lying.This love connection, if you can call it that, is not believable at all. These two have no chemistry and the dialogue between the two is laughable. I don't see the sex appeal of this guy. He looks incredibly goofy here and his so called acting will turn you off. The whole story relies on the audience believing that these two are in love. This film doesn't pull that off and pushes it too quickly. They tell each other they love the other within a week, at least that's what I got out of it.The special effects are horrendous. Something that a blind guy can pull off in his basement. The 'speed' of the vampire is cringe-worthy. Should I mention the lack of fangs? Or how about how bad the fight sequences are choreographed. It looked like they were dancing instead of trying to kill each other. Speaking of the fight sequence, it involves the so called 'bad-guy', another Vampire called James. He literally comes out of nowhere no development, no sense of who he is and the risks for the characters are no longer there.The story is interesting, yet done before. The entire film is a teenage melodrama with vampires added in. I like the back story the have going, which isn't explored, but most likely will be in the sequels. The Cullens (vampire family) was interesting and I liked how they looked out for each other. The film doesn't get the least bit interesting until the other vampires show up to a baseball game. Yup, the most interesting scene in the film is a baseball game.Don't get me started on the horrible music.I will say this though, I'll watch the next one in the hopes they get interesting and go somewhere. But if it's as bad and laughable as this trash, consider me done with it.",4,0,2,20 July 2009
Wreck-It Ralph," The Best Animated Film of the year
","Disney, taking a cue from Pixar, showed a short film before the screening of Wreck it Ralph. It was a cute mixture of different forms of animation, titled Paperman. A paper pusher runs into a woman on his way to work, everything in this world is black and white, like paper. Except for her lips, which are red. He is instantly infatuated with her and when a piece of paper blows onto her face, her red lipstick sticks makes a mark. He can't stop thinking about her and when he sees that she is in the building across the street, he decides to put all those papers to use. Cute, well thought out and conveys great emotion without a single word used. I hope every animated feature starts putting out shorts because it's a nice addition. Now, onto Wreck it Ralph. I'm in mid mid twenties, so the idea of retro game characters coming to life when the lights go out, think of Toy Story, appealed to me greatly. The first half of this film, I enjoyed immensely, it took me back to my childhood. The second half, my girlfriend enjoyed immensely, because everything was bright and colourful candy. Wreck-it Ralp is tired of being a villain. No one talks to the bad guys and everyone loves the good guys. Fix-it Felix earns medal after medal for beating the game and Ralph is tired of it. He wants his own medal, he wants to be part of the group. When he hears of another game, Hero's Duty, a first person shooter where you can get a medal, he game jumps. Something that is forbidden. When Ralph accidentally finds himself in an escape pod, with the medal and an alien creature from the game, it zooms out of the game and game jumps yet again, into Sugar Rush, a mario kart styled game where everything is edible. If he doesn't get back to his own game in time, it won't be playable and deemed broken. If a game is broken it gets unplugged, if it gets unplugged, the game characters have nowhere to go. Can Ralph get back to his own game in time to save himself and everyone else? Will the alien he was stuck with infect Sugar Rush? Can Ralph finally be a hero for once?All these questions are answered in this fully realized game that had me smiling from start to finish. Sure it tends to be more conventional as it goes on, but that didn't bother me because I was immersed in this world. You know screen you play on in the arcade? Well, the characters see it too, in fact they see you, the gamer, playing them. When the lights go out, they all go to game central, you'll see the likes of Sonic, Q-bert, Pacman, and many many more. Half the fun is looking in the background for cameo characters.Ralph is a character with one goal, become a hero. Clear cut, the characters he meets along the way help and hinder his goal. We follow him from point A to point B. As I mentioned before, the first half of the game will appeal to the older crowd, while the second half will appeal to the younger crowd. Characters make fun of the title Hero's Duty, so you know there is some potty humour involved. There are a lot of in joke references for the gamers out there. I won't reveal them because that takes away the surprise of it all. Suffice to say, Wreck it Ralph works. They set up the rules of their world and follow through on them. Everything mentioned at one point in the film has a purpose and comes into play later on. Nothing in the film is a throw away. That's why I enjoyed it so much. Kids will love it, specifically Sarah Silverman's character of Vanellope. Adults will like it because the story is well thought out and the comedy delivers.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 48 Frames: An Unexpected Journey
","A mild-mannered Hobbit by the name of Bilbo Baggins is tasked with joining a group of Dwarfs, lead by Gandalf, to the Lonely Mountain in the hopes of claiming their home and gold back from the dragon Smaug. When word first broke out that Jackson would be splitting the 300 some odd pages of the children aimed book The Hobbit, into another epic trilogy, a lot of people groaned at how thin he would be able to stretch the material. In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, everything and anything that would have ended up on the cutting room floor is thrown in here, such as the Rock Giants. Why? Is it because The Hobbit lacks the thrills and spectacle that is the Lord of the Rings. I'm going to put my bottom dollar on yes. Jackson needed something to fill his films with in order to excite the audience, thrill them and make them have the same awe they did more than a decade ago.I want to say that The Hobbit works wonderfully, and it does for the most part. There are obvious flaws throughout, but my question is this. How do you rate a film, when it is presented in a format so distracting that it hurts your overall enjoyment of it? Not only am I talking about the use of 3D, but the infamous 48 HFR which it is presented. Let me get these two issues out of the way first.The 3D here is utterly useless. There are basically two kinds of 3D being presented to an audience right now. The Gimmick and the Immersive. The gimmick is what one would see in the Saw 3D, Final Destination 3D....any horror film really. Gags that poke out at the screen with gotcha moments. The second, the kind that James Cameron is trying to champion is the immersive one, in which the 3D makes you feel like you are in this world. Objects aren't really shooting out at you, but float around you. The most horrid use of 3D, many would have to agree is Clash of the Titans, but I must say, The Hobbit might give it a run for its money. Not once did I ever feel immersed in Middle Earth. It was not used to the scope and scale it should have been. There was depth, sure, but who wants to see depth with two people talking? It is distracting and overworks the brain to compensate for the film trickery. Second, the 48 HFR. I would suggest that the average movie goer seek out 24. I know Jackson wants to present the film in 48, but it is simply the wrong movie for this format. First and most noticeable. People move quicker, like they are on fast-forward of your DVD remote. Simple task like picking up a cup, are too quick and make for an awkward and unpleasant viewing experience. Later on this is not as intrusive, but most of the damage will already be done. Second, the clear, crispness of the picture. I am one for HD presentation on my television, but here it seems odd and out of place. Many people have compared the look and feel of the film to daytime Soap Operas. I would tend to agree. It feels like something on TV. The digital presentation makes close up scenes seem really out of place when cutting in from afar. Those far away shots and sequences looks spectacular, most of the CGI is wonderfully realized in this frame rate, but everything sticks out like a sore thumb. The first thing I noticed was the fabric and lines on Gandalfs hat. Feels like it was something out of The Wizard of Oz, or a stage play. The realism of the smoothed over 24 is gone, the digital crisp of 48 is a win/lose situation. I had more problems with it than enjoyment. With those problems constantly battling my enjoyment back to Middle Earth, I did walk away pleasantly surprised with the film. Everyone is on their A-game, which is of no surprise as Ian McKellen and Martin Freeman are always spectacular. Freeman manages to make a character I didn't care for in the original films, likable. Peter Jackson loves this world and his passion shows. One of the drawbacks would be that the film comes off as too cartoonish. This might be because the book was aimed to a younger crowd, but the Dwarfs and their antics are something out of a Star Wars prequel. Sure, they are meant to be comedic relief, but when dangerous and life threatening situations are happening, you don't want to be seeing them jump from tree to tree like some Warner Brothers cartoon. Of course, being a prequel, it's fun to see things being set-up for the Lord of the Rings. The best sequences is of course the Riddles in the Dark with Gollum, who looks better than ever. The Hobbit is a wonderful film, that doesn't match the scope, energy or emotion of the Lord of the Rings. Go in expecting a good fantasy, nothing more and you'll walk away satisfied....that's if you walk away from a screening in 24 fps.Leave 48 for Animated and Planet Earth like content.",8,8,17,23 December 2012
The Pianist," Gritty and Realistic
","It took me this long to actually watch the entire film, not because I couldn't, or wouldn't, but simply because it was never a top priority. After watching the whole thing, I can't believe how stupid I was. This film is an experience everyone should have, the horrors of the war and the holocaust are nothing easy to view and this film doesn't side step the subject matter either.The Pianist is no Schindler's List, but it never tries to. It's no second rate Schindler either, it's telling it's own story and the two are powerful on their own merits. Polanski even adds in his own personal experiences, thus making it more personal.Adrien Brody is astonishing. I was upset he won he the Oscar, even though I didn't see the film at that time. Now after viewing it, I am satisfied. He gives a heartbreaking performance and seeing his transformation from start to finish shows the dedication Brody took to this role.The film does not tread lightly on the subject matter either, there are numerous scenes that will shock the viewer. I gasped a couple times and could only imagine what some of the characters were thinking at the time, specifically the scene in which the German officer had to reload his gun just to shoot the man on the ground.My favourite shot is when Brody is walking down the isolated street, full of luggage and personal belongings, crying over the death of his family, as it rains down ash. Amazing work.",9,0,1,20 July 2009
Revolutionary Road," The American dream is actually a nightmare.
","A young couple living in 1950's suburbia think they are different from all the other families living the American Dream. Although, they soon find out that not every dream comes true and they fall exactly into the situations they didn't want to be in. Their marriage is falling apart, they have trouble raising their children and they want out of this lifestyle.Sam Mendes is a filmmaker who knows exactly what he wants, which is why he would want to work on this film. Revolutionary Road is probably his least interesting film, story wise. After-all, it's just about two people who try to cope with their lives. There is no motivational plot to it, but the thing about this film is that it doesn't need one. We are getting a glimpse into the lives of two people who had big dreams and realized that they had to sacrifice them in order to live their lives. It's sad, but it also rings true. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, as the married couple who constantly fight. Everyone called this film the 'What If Jack and Rose Ended Up Together' movie. Yet it is so much more than that. They give powerful performances, which unfortunately were overlooked during the Oscar season. Another Titanic star, Kathy Bates, gives her support to the couple as the real estate agent who thinks the world of them. She has a son, who is mentally unstable and asks to bring him over for dinner one night. Michael Shannon plays the son and he steals both scenes he is in. For a guy who is deemed insane, he is the only one who speaks the truth. I watched this flick because so many people told me how depressing it was. While it was depressing I didn't find it to be that bad. The most depressing aspect of the film is how relatable it is to real life. This story happens everywhere and that is the sad part. The cinematography is great, the 1950's feel was spot on and really gave the film more of a cinematic sense of wonder to it. Roger Deakins seems to know exactly what is needed for every film he takes on. The look and feel of the film here is so simple, yet so beautiful at the same time. Finally, I can see why people may not like this film. It's definitely an acquired taste. I was not in love with it by any means and for those involved it's not their best work. Instead it's a film to enjoy once. I wouldn't bother watching it again because the pace is long and I feel that I won't be as engaged a second time. On a final note, why do guys from the 1950's only last about 15 seconds?",7,14,17,2 May 2010
28 Days Later...," 'Disappointing attempt at reviving a dying genre'
","A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood, the virus infects those and turns them into a zombie like creature. Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realizing that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them.Here is a little film that could have been a jump start in the horror genre, but with it's 2nd act, it falls apart as it tries to be something more then it actually is. It sells itself as an end of the world, fight for our lives film, and does that successfully for the most part, but when it takes a turn into a more humane state, it fizzles out and loses any interest it once had.Don't get me wrong, I loved the field scene, that was tremendous, the cinematography was really great. The deserted London was probably one things in this movie, that make it watchable. I liked how they weren't you 'typical' slow moving 'grrr' zombies, but blood-coughing, running marathon zombies. IF you would call them zombies, or just people infected with 'RAGE' The military characters are the worse, with the British soldiers being nothing more than your typical foul-mouthed grunts. The clever use of dialogue in 'Dog Soldiers' was fast and hip, but still built characters, here it most definitely does not.What does set this apart from your other zombie type movies is of course is isolated in London feel to it. The main character wakes up naked, sort of reborn, and finds himself in a new world where people are infected with a virus called rage, that turns them into a zombie like creature. It;s nice to see what people would do in this situation, and we get varies degrees of that.Our heros were in more trouble with other humans then they were with the creatures. By the time we got to the climax you were cheering on the Zombies. I thought the love story felt forced because 'every' movie needs a love story and I found nothing at all to be thought provoking because it had all been done before. One thing I found odd was the lack of security when the 'activists' liberate the chimps.Since I had such high hopes for this film and was totally astonished at how terrible the last 20 or so minutes of the film was, a horrible ending did the movie in for me, it became the most disappointing movie of the summer.",6,1,2,22 September 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Something has survived.
","Think we saw the last of those pesky dinosaurs from the original Jurassic Park? Think again. This time around we are going to another island, called Site B. It's here where the dinosaurs actually run free, no cages. Which means that the filmmakers have up the ante a bit. Our humans are stuck on this island while another group of humans decide to go hunting. For some strange reason the film finishes with the T-REX running around San Diego. How can a film live up to the original? The first was such a huge moment in blockbuster history. Well we are giving no Sam Neil and more Jeff Goldblum. The sequel, is a little too ambitious that it loses itself in all of its grandeur. How could they raise the stakes in this film? Well, for one they thrown the characters into a world that they have absolutely no control over. No cages, no wires or buildings. This is a natural and free environment, this is the dino-environment. Second, we have a freaking T-REX run around San Diego. Yup, to raise the stakes they needed to bring one of those guys back. In a way it feels like a failed King Kong experiment. The Lost World gives fans what they wanted, more raptors. Yet these raptors are different, more deadly apparently. Velociraptors, yippie, yet they can be taken out by a little girl because she is also a gymnast. Yes, people still moan about that scene and there is a good reason for it. It is utterly ridiculous. I can forgive a character being scared of a snake and getting killed by the Rex, but not that damn gymnastic scene.Vince Vaughn is in this flick and I think after this and Psycho, he decided that comedy was his one and only place to be. Sure he tried again with The Cell and Domestic Disturbance, but both films failed. He's not bad here, but he also seems out of his element. I wouldn't mind seeing him in another film like this though, give him another chance, but his strong elements are clearly comedy.Lost World is not as great as the original, but it's also not the travesty people make it out to be. There are many parts in the film that don't live up to the expectations it sets out for itself. The San Diego sequence is insane and you either love it or hate it. I remember seeing this film in the theatres when I was a kid, my opinion of it has lessened since then. I was 10 then, I'm 22 now. It almost feels like the Temple of Doom of the series. It's something kids love but adults seem to roll their eyes at. But that would have to make Jurassic Park III good, when it's just like this one, mediocre.",6,0,2,14 August 2010
Beasts of No Nation," 'I just want to be happy in this life.'
","There is a lot of controversy over the release of this film. Not for content (per say) or any behind the scenes production fights, but for the actual release itself. This film was purchased by Netflix and is the first film from the streaming company. They have released the film both in theatres and on their streaming service. This is a big 'No, No' for theatre chains as they typical request a 90-day exclusive window. So, a bunch of theatre chains have boycotted the film and refuse to show it. Luckily, some smaller independent theatres are showing it, thus making it officially eligible for an Oscar consideration. Now let's look at those chances. Does the film have a chance? Maybe. It certainly has some powerful sequences and performances. Yet, what are the political questions in letting this film be nominated? We all know the Oscars are old school Hollywood and Netflix seems to be anti- everything. They are producing original content and changing the way people view television shows. Is this the next step for cinema? Well, all that aside, how is the actual film? Netflix didn't produce the film, they purchased it. Unlike their television shows, so who knows what an actual Netflix film will look like. Cary Fukunaga wrote, shot, produced and directed Beasts of No Nation and if this guy doesn't have a bright future ahead of him in Hollywood, then I don't want to watch movies anymore. Everyone fell in love with the first season of True Detective. Why? Was it the writing? No, Pizzolatto proved that with the second season. What about McConaughey and Harrelson? They surely are a big portion of it, but most people talk about the look, the feel and the direction of it. Specifically the long take showcased in episode 4. How good is Beasts of No Nation? Strikingly good. The premise alone gives me an uneasy tension that can't be shaken. The film tells the story of Agu, a child who finds himself as a soldier in a civil war in Africa. He's a captive. He's a killer. Is he brainwashed to believe everything or simply fighting for survival. The film is a brutally honest look at the lives and deaths of those who are stuck within this cruel world. Fukunaga wrote and directed the film. They had a cinematographer, but due to an injury he had to drop out at the last second, which forced Fukunaga to shoot the film himself. Maybe this was a good thing, because the film is gorgeous. Luscious greens fill the screen from the jungle, bloody red fills the dirt they trek through, decrepit towns overrun by ruthless killers. One sequences Fukunaga stages for us is very reminiscent of a brutally shocking scene from City of God. Here, we have Agu faced with the task of having to kill someone. Fukunaga sets the stage, slowly ups the stakes and then revels in the carnage brought forth. Shocking and disturbing and would have been even more so had I not seen the aforementioned film. Abraham Attah stars as Agu, the child robbed of his childhood. An undeniably great performance from a first time actor. A lot of times, first time actors are hit or miss. They can deliver a brilliant performance, or ruin a film. It's the lack of 'acting' that delivers some honest performances sometimes. The same goes for children, who are unaware, often, of the nature of things. They have an innocence that sometimes gets lost as they grow older. Abraham Attah has the benefit of being both a child and a first time actor. The result is a truthful performance that I for one hope receives some recognition come awards season. If they can honour the performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild than they can do so here. Idris Elba plays the warlord who destroys the lives of these children. He's ruthless in his manipulation of these young minds who are lost without their families. He imposes a fatherly figure all while towering over them with threatening levels of violence. He wants war, he wants bloodshed and will find a way to get it. The supporting cast, full of more first time actors and some actual former soldiers all fit nicely in this package. One character is known as tripod and walks around naked everywhere. Yes, there are some levels of humour here, mostly in the first act. Once things hit the fan, the sheer intensity of everything rises to unnatural levels. Beasts of No Nation is an accomplishment. Clocking in at 2 hours and 20 minutes, the film is a bit on the long side, but I never thought it dragged. I was engaged from start to finish. Attah had me from the beginning till the end. Beasts of No Nation is one of the year's best films.",8,3,5,24 October 2015
Bolt," A Cute Film The Kids Will Enjoy.
","The dog of a big television show thinks everything he is doing is real, until he escapes 'by accident' and is shipped far away to New York. Now he must find his way back to the little girl he loves and protects all while thinking he still has these special powers.The film's animation is nothing spectacular, but will please the little ones. The opening sequence is a scene from the television show, so it's packed with fast paced action and editing. Well done and interesting to see how the incorporated the dog into a superhero fighting everything from guys on motorcycles to helicopters.The story itself is good enough to keep me interested and doesn't really get too stale. It goes through the required clich√©s of this type of flick, finding out he has no powers, feeling bad and upset, then realizing he still loves the girl and wants to get back to her, blah blah blah. It's all there, so don't expect anything really new in that department.The voice acting is basic, specifically from the leads, Miley Cyrus and John Travolta. Is she in character? Or playing herself? The cat and the hamster steal the show in every scene they are in. Good chemistry between the three characters on their way back to Hollywood, which makes for some good laughs and more toys for the little ones to buy.I can recommend the film because it is entertaining, feels like this years Kung Fu Panda, then again it feels like this years any animated film that isn't Pixar. Give it a look, the inclusion of the cat and hamster characters give it enough of a comedic touch to make it slightly above average.",8,1,3,20 July 2009
2012," We Were Warned.....About How Crappy This Movie Is.
","2012 is a jumbled mess of a film. Roland Emmerich stated that for his last disaster flick he wanted to make it so that no other disaster flick could come after it. Well, mission accomplished because I don't want to see anymore. Upping the disaster scale to the entire world might do well for the special effects guys, buy not the paying viewer.2012 has a very thin plot. People must survive. Is that a plot? It's more of a story. John Cusack is one of those people and he is with his ex-wife, his two kids and their step father, whom he hates. He gets the word that disaster is going to strike when a crazy old hippie guy, Woody Harrelson (big stretch) tells him about the world crumbling beneath our feet. This happens and the poop hits the fan. It seems that every single person in California dies, except for this one group. Why might you ask? Apparently Cusack, who is not only a writer, but a limo driver, has the skills and the vehicle power (a limo) to outrun global destruction. Emmerich is not that bad of a director. He is often compared to Michael Bay for choosing big scale productions and not caring about story or characters. 2012 is the perfect example of this. In his earlier film, Independence Day, he gave us big explosions and aliens to shoot. Characters were lacking but the charisma of Will Smith, the character actor of Jeff Goldblum and Randy Frickin Quaid gave us something to smile at. John Cusack is wooden, Amanda Peet cries and a big Russian guy speaks with a thick accent. We are given zero, nadda, not even an inch of anything interesting to care about these characters. Why do I care if they live? Why do I want to spend the next 90 plus minutes with them. The answer is you don't. I wanted to spend my time with Woody I'm higher than a kite right now Harrelson. The film is really just an excuse for the special effects guys to do their thing. Yet this is also a hit or miss. Sometimes it's actually entertaining and interesting to see the world fall beneath your feet. Other times it's painfully obvious how fake everything is. Check out the grocery store scene when the entire store literally splits in half. It's like the green screen was done in the 80's. The big event happens while Cusack and co and driving through the thick of it. They drive through buildings, jump obstacles, get covered in human feces. You read that right.The children cry and are annoying. The older son doesn't seem to respect his dad, he calls him by his first name and not dad. Yet of course, because the world is about to end, he re- evaluates his outlook on his flawed hero of a father and calls him dad. He even risks his life to be with him. The daughter just tries to not wet her bed. The step father is a nice guy, yet for some reason who are told to hate him. The conclusion of his character is sad and a pathetic excuse to get the torn family back together. Am I really ruining anything for you?Danny Glover is the president...remember the last time Hollywood had a black president, I think there was a giant asteroid heading towards the earth. Is Hollywood trying to tell us that we are doomed the day a black man becomes president. I wonder when that day will come...oops. A side plot involving rich people being the ones who will be saved is tiresome. The film tries to villainize a rational man. 2012 tries to make you believe that it's a small world, all these people who meet at one point will meet again. This is suppose to be WORLD DESTRUCTION. There is another problem, too many characters to not care about. Are we really suppose to care about George Segal and the conflict with his son that lasts all about 3 minutes? 2012 is a blunder, a disaster of a disaster film. Bigger is not always better. It lacks the science, logic and intelligence it needs to be taken with any credibility. Universal Soldier, Stargate and Independence Day are all entertaining flicks in my mind. Everything since has been crap, let's just name those films off shall we? Godzilla? The Patriot? The Day After Tomorrow? 10,000 B.C. God, I forgot that film even existed. 2012 was a film to see in the theatres for the loud sound and big screen special effects. Now that the theatre time has passed, there is no point in seeing it.",3,2,4,5 August 2010
Ghost Rider," Point Here...Point There....
","I can sum up this film with two words. Pointing and Cleavage. That's right...lots of pointing and lots of cleavage. The perfect mix to get teenage boys in their seats. Oh wait, cleavage, action and goofy special effects gets their asses in those seats. Well Ghost Rider has that down pat too.It's not that I don't like this film, it's just that it's not particularly that good. Nic Cage, whom I have grown to really love as an actor, seem completely out of place here. I don't know if it was his bad hair, bad chemistry or his bad Elvis impersonation, but he did not sell this role for me.Eva Mendes, great too look at and in the right role can really deliver a good performance. She has nothing to really do here except be what I have already 'pointed', hehe, get it, out to you. Cleavage. I don't know if 'respected' reporters where those types of shirts, but I was distracted every time she was on screen.The supporting cast, which includes Peter Fonda, Donal Logue and the weird plastic bag kid from American Beauty (just kidding, Wes Bently) ham it up. The big villain in this film is a kid that I do not find evil or intimidating. Fonda merely walks around the scenes and never does anything of interest and Logue has too few scenes to really even mention. Don't get me started on Sam Elliott. Here's a guy whose big scene had me pumped, then left me with a sour taste in my mouth after he merely walks away during the big climax.The Ghost Rider effects are neat, but the bad guys were hokey. Earth, wind and water? The way people died was laughable too. We know that the relatively not so popular comic book characters can really be good films, this one missed the boat.",5,1,1,20 July 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," 'This Is A Perfect Example Of How To Destroy A Franchise'
","A so called cure is found in the blood of a young mutant, which divides the world into two sections. Those who want it and those who don't. Magneto and his brotherhood seek to find this boy and capture him, while the X-men must stand together, through hard times and put a stop to Magneto and his evil ways.Being a fan of the comics, I can say that the first X-men film did an okay job at bringing them to the big screen. The second film took the mutant powers to new levels, with more action and more mutants for us to feast our eyes on. It was a treat seeing so many childhood favourite characters come to life. The Last Stand is the third installment, the makers of the film decide to go heavy on the eye popping action and forget to bring everything else with it. Take a note, X-3 is the perfect example of how to destroy a franchise.When Singer left the job to go direct Superman, I had my head searching for a director that could take over the job, Joss Whedon was my choice and after seeing Ratner's piece up on the big screen, I have come to think that many others would agree with my choice. The Last Stand has many problems with it, mainly the story line and how close to strays from the source material. Although, with the bad does come good, so the film is not a total travesty.Some of the nit picks come from a continuation of the first two films, such as introducing Beast and Angel in the third film, when they are in fact original members (along with cyclops, iceman and Jean) of the X-men team. The Last Stand adds too many characters into the film from the comics, giving them only a little bit of screen time. Here's a lesson, when you want to please fans, do not introduce a character and use them for five minutes. Introducing Beast, Kitty Pride/Shadowcat, Leech (horribly done, I'll mention later), Angel, and Juggernaut, cause hell, they weren't juggling enough characters in X-2. Back to Leech though, what's with the complete an utter disregard of the character? In the comics he is green and lives in the sewers, here he is played by the always creepy looking kid (See Ultraviolet and Godsend). If you need a cure type character, make a new one, do not soil another. Juggernaut is Xavier's stepbrother, yet nothing. Would it be confusing to the plot, possibly, but maybe a nod or something when they pass each other to Grey's house. Don't get me started on how they handled Callisto, they totally changed the character and her powers. Storm would wipe the floor with her, although, yet again Storm as a character is underused, just like the first two films. Even with Berry commanding a bigger role, she is still not used to her full potential. Could it possibly be because of Berry herself not being confident in her role?Out of all the X-men story lines, the Dark Phoenix is probably the most recognizable. It is vast, emotional, and everything you could ever ask for in a comic book story line. Hmm, now why would you throw that into this movie when you already have another story line. The Dark Phoenix SAGA, did that word mean nothing to you? SAGA, should have a movie of it's own, one in which unites both Magneto and the X-men to take on a greater evil. Her story was completely rushed and used as a second handle to the main plot, of the cure. Granted, to make the story movie friendly, you'll need to change the fact they go into space, but please make it more friendly then what has been fed to us. Some major characters do hit the hay. Is it just me, or has one of the X-men character been getting the shaft over the last two X-men films? Read the comics guys, after Jean's death Cyclops leaves the X-men, not what happens in the film.I was happy to see some nods for the hardcore fans out there, such as the 'fastball special', the danger room and sentinels. The film, as I said before, is not all entirely bad. This review is from the fan boy in me. The Last Stand has a lot of action, which should please those who want to see the mutant powers in full effect. Unless you're a Colossus fan, he is underused yet again. The Juggernaut, after small fight with Logan, does nothing but run through walls. Iceman actually turned to ice, that was neat. Wolverine, doesn't seem like the brutal killer that he is in the comics, here we see him kicking guys in the nuts and saying comical stuff while doing it.Ultimately, Ratner was the wrong man for the job. While the action was superb and the special effects off the wall, it all doesn't make up for the butchering of the story they've done. The ending has either finished the franchise all together or changed it drastically. If there are more films to come, will there be new villains? A Mr. Sinister perhaps, or how about Apocalypse. Probably not, we're probably going to get a BS story about how the cure is only short time, as what was hinted at by the end. Stupid story aside, and if you're not a die hard fan, Last Stand is...dare I say it....enjoyable.",5,0,1,26 June 2006
Hellboy," Anti-climactic Ending Ruins It.
","I looked forward to seeing this flick, ever since the trailer ended with the giant squid like creature grabbing Hellboy after proclaiming 'How Big Can It Be'. That really had 'bad-ass' written all over it. I never went to the theatre though and had to wait for DVD. After seeing the flick I can tell you it's not my favourite comic book adaptation, but it is a decent one.Never reading the Hellboy comics I did not know what I was getting myself into, but the film looked like it was going to do one thing and that was entertain me. The problem I had with it was that it wasn't entertaining enough. It had all the right ingredients, it just didn't mix well. What I got was a pretty average flick with a sub-plot that I did not really care for.Perlman is in his zone with this character and even though he is under heavy make-up, I can't really see anyone else pulling this off the way he does. The right amount of comedic touch adds an odd layer to this demonic looking creature.The rest of the supporting cast didn't do much for me. I didn't care if the young agent died or not and Selma Blair was just too depressed for me to want to like her.The special effects were good and interacted well with the characters. Even though most were over the top, this is a comic book film after all. So I let it slide.Finally, it wasn't climatic enough. Remember when I told you how 'bad-ass' that end part of the trailer was with the giant squid. Well, I was prepped for an epic showdown and was let down by a 10 second fight. That really put me in a bad funk and when you're ending a film, you want your audience to feel good. Shame on you Hellboy, shame.",7,0,0,20 July 2009
Across the Universe," A Film For People With ADD, Who Want To Go On An Acid Trip
","Across The Universe is a musical that tells the story of multiple people living in the time of the Vietnam war. A young man travels from Liverpool to find his father, but ends up falling in love with a young American.Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey was a a technical and artistically remarkable film, but it lacked a story, had a long running time and had very little entertainment qualities about it, which ended up hurting the film. Julie Taymor's Across The Universe runs down the same path, it's visually beautiful and full of life, but the lack of story and long running time does more damage then one would imagine.Across The Universe is many things, but above all it is ambitious. It's a musical set to Beatles songs. In a time when the musical is pretty much dead, Taymor relies on visuals and the popularity of the Beatles to bring in the audience. It's a shame that that is all she relied on because the film is severely lacking many things. What it excels in, it does so beautifully, what it fails at is key to what connects the audience to the film. You can't simply have a character sing a verse of a song and expect people to connect just because it's the Beatles.Across The Universe is for people with ADD and who want to go on an acid trip. The film has no real set course, it jumps from one song to the next and from one bizarre and beautiful image to the next. One minute you're with Bono on a bus, the next you're underwater naked. If you're able to keep up with the bombastic images thrown on the screen then you will really enjoy yourself. Every image that is shown on the screen is ripped straight out of a Beatles song. When you hear Strawberry Fields Forever, you see Strawberry Fields. This could ruin some imagery you might have while listening to those songs.The film changes it's direction, from the journey of this young man, named Jude, to the anti war movement with Lucy. Yup, those are their names, along with Max and Prudence and Sadie. All the character names are taken out of the songs as well. Also, it doesn't take a genius to know that the song Hey Jude would inspire this character to do something. The characters, who all are modeled after icons in the music industry, such as Jimmy Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Kurt Cobain, have very little are no arc. With the exception of the two leads, Lucy and Jude, both acted very well by Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess, everyone seems to be one noted. Sadie has one conflict in the film, it is never explored, Prudence has lots of conflict, that is never explored. Prudence even disappears half way through the film, only to show up again at a hallucinating sequences.A lot of the images are beautiful and you will without a doubt encompass it all, but there are still some that are too bizarre to connect to the story. One scene we see Asian woman naked, with their bodies painted white who stand on water, then they dive backwards under it. What does this, and many other symbolic elements mean? We are never told and can't sit and think because the next image is thrown at us right after.You will be tapping your toes to the music and singing along as well, if you know the lyrics. There were two or three songs I didn't quite know, but I'm sure the hardcore Beatles fans will know them all. Although, not all the songs are happy dance numbers. Some of them are poorly done, surprisingly I Am The Walrus from Bono is one of them. Jor Cockers take on Come Together is a highlight as well as the army sequences performed to She's So Heavy.Across The Universe is ambitious, beautiful and will have you singing along to the tunes. It's about thirty minutes too long and has very little character development and plot, but the story is there. It's just sung aloud in song and not really performed. If you can get pass a lot of the obvious film images and metaphors, like Prudence coming out of the closet, then Across the Universe is a film for you.",6,0,2,6 November 2007
The Mist," Writing This Review....My Jaw Is Still On The Floor From The Ending.
","After a freak and powerful storm, Drayton, his son and their neighbour ride into town to grab some supplies from the local supermarket. Upon arriving at store, it seems almost everyone in town had the same plan. A man bleeding from the nose runs into the store screaming about something in the mist that attacked him and took his friend. The mist rolls in and everyone is trapped inside, scared of leaving because of the creatures the dwell within it.When I saw previews for The Mist, I wasn't too impressed. I thought it was going to be another run of the mill Hollywood horror film that wouldn't be scary, thrilling, gory, tense or have any characters that I could give a damn about. That was even with Darabont behind the camera. After finally seeing it, I sit here wrong on all counts. The Mist is just as thrilling and scary and tense as you want it to be, yet it falls short in many areas, mostly out of frustration on my part.Thomas Jane isn't the best actor around. When you fight fight sharks and John Travolta how far can you really go into a character. Here he gets the chance, being a father who must take care of his scared son, act as a leader in the store and ultimately survive the horror that awaits him outside. Now he does try here, but it comes off as some twilight zone B movie acting. Which is, what I can only assume, is what Darabont wanted. His screaming in the film's conclusion is hurtful, both in terms of acting and in sorrow for the character. His son is given nothing to do but cry and be scared, which you can guess is exactly what a little kid would be in this situation.The tension created is great, the mist rolls in and everyone is stuck inside. We don't know who or what these things are, but we know we are in for some scary things. Then we actually see them and that tension goes down a bit. In scenes in which the creatures interact with the humans, it comes off as fake and cheesy. By itself, it is quite neat, but still not truly horrifying. I felt like they missed a chance with some tension in the audio department. It starts off nice, with an alarm alerting the town of danger, but after that we get things that are few and far between. For instance, while we are in the mist, to build tension we could have heard the creatures crawling around. For people at home it would be great with surround sound. The only instance I remember them doing this was in the pharmacy.I like that we don't know for sure where these things came from, and the sci/fi element is a neat addition. If we were full blown told what these things were and where they came from it would ruin the ambiguity of the whole film. This film stands out for me because of the way it was shot, very surreal, hand held and in the moment. If everything were nicely panned and smooth flowing, it would feel to fake.I have two gripes, which is why the film is rated lower then what this review if praising it for. One, for those who've seen it know where I am going, is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but you will either like it, or hate it. Which is ironic because I am on the fence with it. I applaud them for throwing a curve ball and showing us something that is so anti-Hollywood, but I felt cheated. You don't invest two plus hours into these characters and then pull off something like that. I called the ending....as a joke. I didn't expect it to be true. It's not really a twist, but what happens is shocking.Second, the characters. I have never hated so many characters in one film. The Jesus freak stands out as one of my most hated characters in cinema history, right up there with Franklin from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I know she was suppose to be hated, but I just couldn't stand her at all. While watching the film, I put myself in some of the characters shoes and I would have never let that woman done half the stuff she did. Also, how do 90% of the people in there fall victim to her babble? I could understand some people following her, but with her reputation and the amount of hate people had for her it was too unrealistic to see so many do her bidding. Whatever happened to people banding together to defeat evil, not turn on each other. Are we as humans so disgusting that when we are thrown into danger we kill one another. That isn't what America would have you believe, especially after the 9/11 attacks. I literally got up out of my seat and cheered at one scene, which finally shut her up.The Mist is a hard film to like all the way through, it pulls you in so many different directions that you feel uneasy about it as a whole. It is skillfully made and 2/3 of it is horror classic. Yet it doesn't fulfill what I wanted it to, which is a shame because I really liked it.",7,6,14,19 June 2008
I Am Legend," Great Special Effects & Premise - Mediocre Delivery.
","After a so called cure for cancer mutates the host into a vampire like creature, 90% of earth's population ends up dead. One man, who is immune to the virus, stays in New York to find a cure.I Am Legend is the third film to be made from the book with the same name. The first two, The Last Man On Earth and The Omega Man, I have not seen. After viewing Legend, I can only hope they both have a stronger second half and conclusion, because Legend fails to capture it's audience in the third act.The idea behind Legend is great and the in the right hands, the possibilities are endless. After viewing Legend I found myself wondering why it feels like two different films. Years prior Smith starred in a film about Robots taking over the city. In I, Robot the machines climb building walls, crash through glass and will not stop until they kill everyone. The third act of Legend follows the same structure. I couldn't help but picture the vampires as the robots as the climbed buildings and ripped through ceilings. The vampires themselves aren't too impressive on the technical scale. Seeing them attack wasn't as impressive as it should have been. They looked way too fake and it took me out of the reality of the film.The whole film lands on Smith's shoulders and he pulls it off. The isolation in such a big city takes its course and slowly he begins to lose his mind. He interacts with his dog Sam and mannequins at the video store so he can have some kind of interaction. Tom Hanks did a similar thing in Cast Away. The film starts 3 years after the virus hits and it's a marvel to see the city in the state it's in. The technology we've created is what killed us. The technology we created is what outlived us. Seeing the tall buildings stands still while there is no live around it was astounding. The grass creeping through the streets, the abandoned cars and live animals roaming the city of New York. The special effects for this film is the highlight. It creates an atmosphere that no other post apocalyptic film has ever created. It makes one wonder if this will be our future. If we all die, will the things we created live on.While the film does try and get us to connect with the lead character at the beginning, it doesn't try to keep that connection. It moves into an action film and I suddenly couldn't really care if Smith lived or died. I felt more of a connection with the dog Sam then I did with Smith. The film works up until one point, then it seems to go downhill and never catches back up with itself. When two new characters suddenly appear on the island.There are bits and pieces of the film that don't really make sense. Like how all the creature look exactly alike, but those small things aside Legend is an enjoyable flick. It has moments of intense scenes, but then it has moments that make you question why. Such as why there appears to be a leader in the vampire pack. The flashbacks that are used to tell what happened to his family during the contamination of the city aren't that effective. It would have been more useful to have the flashbacks told with different days, instead of one night. Seeing Smith learning new ways to cope with his surroundings, meeting the infected for the first time, anything would have really worked. But they never took that advantage. It would have worked to connect us with Smith's character.While Legend does have the performances or the conclusion one would hope, but it is worth a look at for it's special effects alone. It has it's fair share of problems, it stars of slow and ends fast. It's a mixed bag, the story is great, but presented on an average form. The special effects are astounding, but some of it look fake, like the vampires. In the end I did enjoy myself and that's what people look for at the movies.",7,3,6,2 January 2008
The Game," The Ending Did Not Ruin The Film For Me
","Nicholas Van Orton is given a strange birthday gift from his brother. It's a card that tells him to go to this place called CRS, Consumer Recreation Services. They give Nicholas a chance to be a participant in a game. Things get a little too out of hand when the game itself becomes life threatening and Nicholas can't seem to stop it.The Game is never really mentioned when talking about Fincher and his body of work, good or bad it gets left on the cutting room floor. I guess it's because the film is the middleman sort to speak. You have Se7en, and Fight Club, his two most popular and fan favourite films. Then you have Panic Room and Alien 3, considered lower calibre. Zodiac and Benjamin Button seem to be in a totally different class here, but The Game deserves to be mentioned because it is a well written, thought provoking thriller that manages to peel away at it's mysteries and never have the viewer bored. Even the film's ending, which many people seem to complain about, did not make me hate the film, or think the first 80 or so minutes were a waste. The film looks and feels just like Fincher's others. It's cold, dark and unforgiving. He manages to craft his most suspenseful film to date and having Michael Douglass run around trying to solve the mystery helps the case. I'm a sucker for films full of mystery, that slowly but surely peel away at those mysteries to reveal the truth. A lot of crime films are like this, but The Game is something different. A bit more psychological, another reason why I liked it so much. Much like Memento, we are lost like the lead character. We know it's a game, he knows it's a game. But we, nor him, know exactly what the game is or what is happening next. We are trying to solve the same mysteries and Fincher makes us care about these things. Complaints for the film are ones that would have me base the film is reality. To believe the stuff that happens in the film is for one to suspend a lot of belief. The film ends in a way that made me think whether I liked it or not. I would have preferred the first ending, as opposed to the second one, but the way they did it didn't ruin the film. I'm not sure how I will feel on repeated viewings, but as it stands, the thrills were still there and I still enjoyed them. I'm still left with some character motivation questions, some that I will not go into for the sake of spoiling things in the film. Douglass, whom I usually hate, does a great job here. He is a jerk that slowly begins to unwind his sanity. His Gordon Gekko demeanor works here and yet we still root for his character. Sean Penn has a small role, one too small for me to really comment on and the supporting cast usually only have a scene or two to do anything. Deborah Kara Unger plays a good role in which we have to decide whether or not we trust her. She usually plays wackos. The Game is something that might frustrate you with the ending, but that's what films are all about, getting some kind of emotional response. I'm not a fan of the last 3 or 4 minutes, to me it seemed to be tacked on by pressure of the studio and would not be something Fincher would normally do. But in the end, The Game is a worthy film if you are looking for a suspenseful thriller.",8,0,0,1 June 2010
Gran Torino," I Wish I Could Look Bad-Ass Pointing My Finger Like A Gun
","Walt is a retired war veteran who's racist remarks he speaks aloud in every sentence, no matter who he is talking to. After he discovers his new neighbour trying to steal his vintage 1972 Gran Torino, the boy becomes in debt to Walt. Walt ends up getting him to do chorus around the neighbourhood to make up for it. They become closer and Walt's racism towards the family disappears. But the street gang that is causing problems for the kid is up to no good and Walt takes matters into his own hands.For some reason, I have seen Eastwood's last 5 films in theatres. This surprises me because I've never been a big fan of him, having never seen the Dirty Harry films, or The Man With No Name trilogy. In fact, Mystic River was the first film I've seen that had Eastwood's name stamped on it. Sad I know, but true. Now with Gran Torino being labelled his last acting gig, I feel like I've missed out. I've been told by people that this flick is basically if Ditry Harry retired and I've seen enough of that character in pop culture to say that I cannot argue with this point.Gran Torino is the second Eastwood film to come out in 2008, it played in limited theatres here then eventually got a wider release in 2009. I can't tell you which one is better, they are both too different to make an honest decision, but many will enjoy Gran Torino better. For one thing, the final act does not drag itself on too long and it has Eastwood being a bad ass mofo.The young kid, in his first acting role, is pretty bad in my opinion. I've had an argument over this with my friend, he thinks he did a good job. I know it;s his first acting role, but every line he delivers is too forced and it seems like he's trying to remember every single line. It gets annoying after awhile and one particular scene that is suppose to be dramatic comes off a bit too comedic. The older sister though does a good job, this is also her first acting gig. The young priest I'm still on the fence about, he did a decent job, but something about him and his performance just rubbed me the wrong way. I never truly believed him.If this is Eastwood's final film he's acting in, then he goes out on a high note. He plays Walt extremely well as a war vet who seems to hate everyone except his dog. He even throws out his own kid of his house on his birthday. He eventually finds out that he has more in common with his Asian neighbours then his own family. Sure the plot line involving him becoming friends with these people is clich√©d, but Eastwood pulls it off and the transition from bigot to friend between him and the family is real.The film has a few comedic parts, a favourite of mine is when Eastwood is trying to teach the kid to act like more of a man, so he brings him into a barber shop and tells him to listen to how he talks to the barber. What follows is hilarious and racist. Walt spits racist slurs every chance he gets, both when being mean and friendly.The final act has an emotional punch that felt like a bit of a jab, instead of the knockout it intended to be. I wanted to be able to have more of an emotional connection to the film, but it just was not there. I don't know how else they could have ended it though, without it becoming cheap and 'hollywood'. The film ends with Eastwood singing the title song, I'm sorry but I giggled at this part. The ending was suppose to be something emotional and Eastwood's singing chops had me almost laughing. This unintentional humour took away from that emotion.So, while both Changeling and Gran Torino are good flicks, people will like this one more. It's not as melodramatic or disturbing, it fits the mold. All of his films seem to be depressing and I for one would like to see him break that streak. I can't come to give it a better rating though, because it isn't above and beyond.",8,1,5,19 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," Intense, Gritty and A Gripping Drama - Check This One Out
","The Hurt Locker has a lot going against it. One, it's a modern day war film and if the record shows, these films don't do well at this point in time. Two, it has a no name cast, full of those guys from that movie. Three, how entertaining can a movie be about a guy who disarms bombs. The Hurt Locker is a film that will surprise you on every level.Jeremy Renner is the bomb expert, who doesn't like to play by the rules. If course, there is always one of them right? Instead of following orders, he likes to play games, take off his communication device and disrobe of his bomb safety gear. Why? Well, if he is going to die, he wants to die comfortable. His team consists of two men, Anthony Mackie, a by the book soldier who doesn't get along with Renner and Brian Geraghty, a young blood who is afraid of dying. They all seem to get on each others nerves, but to survive they must pull together and act as a team.The film is intense and gritty. Shot hand held for a lot of the scenes, it puts you right beside the bomb. You feel the sweat and hear the ticking. The scenes themselves are done without music, relying more on the drama at hand told straight. Nothing to help build the emotion and this film doesn't need it. There is impending doom music, which to me sounded a bit like The Joker theme from The Dark Knight, but once we get to the disarming stage, it's just us and the bomb.At first the film feels like it's going to be repetitive. We disarm a bomb, then we are back at base and chit chat, then we go back out there another day to disarm another bomb. Just when it feels like it becomes predictable, they pull the rug from under our feet. We are given scene of emotional depth and action round-up. Don't think for a second all the intense scenes involve bombs.I've enjoyed Renner is everything he's done and it's nice to see him front and centre here. He plays the 'wild man' part perfectly. Mackie plays the straight man yearning for more. Both these guys have played men in uniform before. Renner with both Swat and 28 weeks later, Mackie in Eagle Eye. There are a few small roles filled out by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Guy Pearce. Lost fans can see Evangeline Lilly, as Renner's wife. She is given next to nothing in this film and is merely there for more backstory to Renner.I really enjoyed this flick, Bigelow has a hit here. My only complaint is the run time. It's a bit long. There are scenes here and there that could be a lot shorter and seem almost totally out of place, along with some sub-plots that don't always work out. On a whole, this film works and is one of the best of this year.",8,3,8,2 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," I Can't Believe I'm Saying This...Twilight Was Better
","Bella hurts her arm, Edward's brother wants to kill her, he flips out and leaves her. Enter Jacob, a werewolf, he loves Bella, she doesn't love him, teenage drama.This is New Moon in two sentences, I could have done one, but I thought it would try to expand it a little more. The film though, it easily have been done in 90 minutes or less. Why do I watch this stuff? So I can say that I've seen them and make fun of them. To make fun of it without seeing it would be too harsh. But in all honesty, I do give all films an equal chance. After the horrendous film that was Twilight, I knew I would watch the rest of these films because surprise, the actual story of vampires and werewolves is interesting. I wanted to know how everything was going to end, I wanted to know why everyone was in love with these character. After two films, I'm still wondering.New Moon is basically a film with no antagonist and no purpose. It's a filler film, set-up, for what I think and hope will be a better conclusion of the events of the first film. As I said in my brilliant explanation of the film. Bella is turning 18 and in celebration she goes to the Cullen's house. Apparently she prefers the company of dead people than her own father. She cuts herself and it sends one of the forgettable Cullen family members into a tizzy. He wants to kill Bella, Edward stops him and then he decides to leave in order to protect her. Make sense? While he is gone, she flips her nuts. She can't sleep without screaming like a teenage girl would do if someone was stabbing them numerous times. She apparently has no reason to live. Great message to give young girls who are in love with this stuff. If your boyfriend leaves, you're better off dead. Bella has no career aspirations, no motive to be with friends, spend time with family or enjoy life. She simply wants to die to be with Edward. Again, great message for the young ones.Enter Jacob, the second teen heartthrob and rival to Robert Pattinson for the teen love. He is buff and filled out, as Bella says a dozen times. He walks around with no shirt on so that the girls in the audience can scream and cheer. He does this so either A: He doesn't have to buy no shirts every time or B: Girls are horny. He is in love with Bella, she is using him to get over Edward. The film is all about her wanting Edward but not being able to be with him and Jacob wanting Bella and not being able to be with her. The drama is boring, useless and makes for a boring romance film. The film looks and feels better. The special effects are not as bad, the make up looks half decent now and the films have a bigger budget. Unfortunately it has the same actors doing the same stuff, and the same source material that was not good to begin with. The so called vampires still sparkle and have weird powers and the werewolves, who are actually shape shifters look horribly bad. Me saying that the special effects are not as bad really says a lot about how they sucked in the first film.New Moon will please that rabid fan base that wants nothing more than to simply see the books up on screen, no matter how good or bad it is. Kristen Stewart will still bite her lip and brush her hands through her hair. Robert Pattinson will still have awkward kissing scenes with Stewart and have zero chemistry and Taylor Lautner will walk around with no shirt on. This is the Twilight Saga and nothing more. Looking forward to Eclipse.",3,5,6,8 April 2010
Transformers," Better Then Most Of Bay's Other Work.
","To make this story short, good alien robots and bad alien robots crash on earth to find a cube. One wants to destroy it, the other wants total domination.When you go into a Michael Bay film you can expect 2 things to happen. One, balls to the wall action, involving car chases, shoot outs and explosions. Two, characters that have no arc what so ever and we don't really seem to care about them. Such is the case with Transformers. The only difference is, this film is based on a television/toy from the same name, so it's fan base knows the characters and feels attached to them anyway. You can now add Transformers to the list of films that have been transfered from either: Television show, video game, toy, and comic. Unlike 80 percent of films based on these things, Transformers is actually good. This is a big statement, this is the same guy that took a historic moment in American history and turned it into some sappy bad love story. He's back on his game, when he did The Rock.The die hard fans of Transformers will point out it's flaws from the get go, these so called flaws do not affect the film one bit. In fact it helps, the fact that they changed it to fit any kind of reality in film. Do we really want to see Megatron transform into a giant gun, and do the colours of Optimus Prime really matter on the semi? Fans complained that there was no white spider on the suit of Black Spiderman and there's no exception here either.Don't be afraid to see the film if you have no idea about the characters previously. It's simple, blue eyes are good, red eyes are bad. They look like normal machines, but transform into giant robots. I myself never watched the show, I did watch Beast Wars though, a spin off series in which they would transform into pre-historic animal on earth, instead of cars. The main reason to be seeing this film, is to watch some badass robots blowing stuff up trying to kill each other, while destroying the city we live in. This is accomplished, but we also have to be sidetracked through boring non-important sub-plot involving humans.There are two characters that could have been completely cut out, or transformed, no pun intended, into one character. This could have saved time, time that could have been added to what the people want to see, giant robots. The two characters in question are Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor. Here are two people, for other then some comic relief and tech mumbo-jumbo serve no purpose to the advancement of the story. Does she really need a guy whose better at the stuff then she is? Why can she simply be the best and do whatever it is he does? Secondly, there is another subplot the is mentioned but never explored. Megan Fox's characters father has a record and this is used against her...for 2 minutes, then it gets cleared, one scene of drama between two characters, then it's pushed away never to be seen again. These things fall under the one of the two expected things to happen at a BAY film.The other, the action, is in full swing. You'll get goose bumps when you first see them transform, then again when they are in action, destroying the city around them. Everything is so well created that one can actually believe this is happening in the city. I can see some awards thrown this way for special effects. In a time when people have seen spidermen swings through cities, pirates sailing the seas and hobbits roaming to a mountain, it takes something special to be able to make the audience drop their jaws in awe. This film does that.Even though there are plot holes, such as where did Barricade go after he led the other Decepticons into battle in the city? What happened to the x-box, steering wheel and pop machine after they transformed? How does someone as hot as Megan Fox end up with the kid from Even Stevens? Things we will never know. The film has a few surprising faces that pop up. The voice of Agent Smith makes an appearance as the head bad guy, John Turturro, John Voight, Bernie Mac, Zack Ward pop up here and there. I was expecting to see Steve Buscemi be some kind of comic relief guy, but to my disappointment.Transformers has a few steps it misses on that ladder to greatness. A long running time, missing plot holes and character we couldn't care for round up the most of it. I'm sure there are other things, but we go to see this film for one thing. Giant Robots In Action. That my friend is what it delivers, it a breathtaking final scene within the city. Jets fly through buildings, tanks fire left right and centre, crazy is not even a way to describe it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a popcorn movie, that is really really loud.",8,1,5,27 October 2007
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Cloudy With A Chance Is A Great Fun Time
","Failure after failure after failure after failure, Flint decides to solve a certain sardine problem his town has, by converting water into food. He invents a machine, which then goes a bit haywire and launches itself into the sky. Fortunately for him, it worked, and food begins falling out of the sky. Unfortunately it eventually gets a mind of it's own and tries to destroy to town with over-sized food. Look at the pretty colours. Those were the words from my girlfriend when we saw the trailer for this film, which we sadly did not see in the theatres. Yes, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs is a great animated kids film with more than enough comedy for the older crowd. Although it wasn't the best animated film last year, it was the funniest in my opinion. The animation fit the story perfectly and the food falling all over were great visuals. You can tell the animators had a lot of fun with this film. Sony Pictures Animation haven't really had a film in their roster to stand out and to me, this one is their golden ticket. It's a shame it wasn't recognized at the Oscars, as I think it deserved a place on the nomination list. The kids learn valuable lessons about responsibility and being yourself, while getting to have fun with the images of ice cream snowball fights, a building made out of jello and a school covered by a giant pancake. The adults get the comedy of Bill Hader from SNL, recognizable voices of Mr. T, Neil Patrick Harris and the man, the myth, the legend himself, Bruce Campbell. Each role fit their voice actor perfectly. Usually Anna Faris annoys me, here she made me like her character more because of her unique voice. James Caan as the dad is the added cherry on the top of the cake. Gummi Bear Twilight Zone reference? Brilliant.The film is really funny and hits every note it has to. The climax works perfectly and the vibrant colours will keep the kids watching the screen. The disaster film has been given the animated kids film treatment and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs for the entire family.",8,1,1,26 May 2010
Children of Men," 'A Bleak Brilliant & Visionary Achievement, One Of the Years Best Films - A Must See'
","In the not too distant future, women have stopped giving birth. No one knows how it happened, all we know is that it happened. The world is on the brink of destruction and only Britain remains intact. After word that the world's youngest person has died at the age of 18, a bomb goes off killing dozens of people in a coffee shop. Theo a former activist meets up with Julian, former lover and activist and discovers that a young woman KEE is pregnant. It's now up to him to get her across the dangerous road side in order to save humanity.Cuaron directed the best Harry Potter film to date and scores again with his recent film Children of Men. Children of Men is one of three films directed by the 'Three Amigos' the other two being Pan's Labyrinth and Babel. I haven't seen the other two but it would take something very special to take the top spot. As depressing and desolate as this film is, there is a message of hope all throughout.Theo, the main character played by Clive Owen is thrown into a mission that could mean his life. There are dangers all throughout the world and the last thing he needs is to add more of it near him. Theo never seems to smile, other then when he is with Jasper, his hippie friend, played comically by Michael Caine. Caine does well with what he's got. Even though the character is suppose to be the comedic relief, Caine plays him with a bit of sorrow. Owen plays Theo with a calm undertone and is convincing as a man torn apart by one terrible incident in his life. It's a strong performance.The film's pace is slow when it needs to be and fast when it needs to be. All the characters have one goal in this film and the film never strays from that goal. Theo must get this woman to the Human Project. There are twists and turns on the way to their goal, of course, but it never gets overdone with any subplots. This is surprising because a lot of futuristic films are hard to follow (12 Monkeys for example).Without a doubt, Children Of Men is the most visually stunning film of the last 5 years. There are 3 distinctive scenes in which everything is simply breathtaking. First of all would be the ambush on the car. Although it's not all done in one take, it is cleverly edited to make it appear so. The scene itself is not only beautiful but thrilling. The second scene happens half way through the film, but I won't say what happens so I don't spoil it for you. The third scene in question is in climatic battle at the end that is stunning beyond words. The hand held camera adds more authenticity to the scenes in which we all feel like we are in this war torn world. That last scene is as scary as it is brilliant. Having Owen and the camera operator run through these dangerous encounters is wonderful. I can't praise this one scene enough. Probably one of the best scenes to grace the screen in cinema history.The film itself is frightening in it's dark crisp vision of the future. Children of Men is a remarkable experience and an incredible achievement in film. Cuaron and co have created a future that some will claim is a clear cut copy of what we are living in today. Politics aside, this future he has presented us is dark. The film has only a handful of lighthearted moments, most of them are with Caine in his hippie state. Cuaron never sticks us in the face with the film's message, while films like Blood Diamond are heavy handed with it's message, Children of Men asks us to simply think about our future and what we can do to help it.I can't say enough praise for this film and what it has achieved. It's not only a bench mark in film, but it's entertaining. With strong performances from everyone involved and Cuaron's keen eye behind the camera, this film is a wonder to behold. I urge everyone to see this film, even if it's just for the last scene alone. Visually pleasing and if you can handle it's bleak overtones you will enjoy yourself. One of the years top five films.",9,4,10,30 May 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Good film, not deserving of it's praise.
","So what is all this talk about Million Dollar Baby about? Well it is a good film, mostly directing. Clint I believe has himself another Oscar (Sorry Marty). The film does indeed look and feel real, which is a good relief from the recent Big Budget Fantasy films. Clint handles the characters extremely well and gives them each their moment in the sun.The gritty old feel of this film is perfect for it's style and the theme of boxing. Everyone gives great performances, unfortunately, Swank, doesn't deliver on the level of expectancy. Don't get me wrong, she does a very well job of giving the character emotion and depth and you feel for this girl, but it seems like we've seen it before and it becomes clich√©d.The script was well written, the film actually becomes something of it's own in the third act, which is the best part of the film. Morgan Freeman and Clint both deliver great performances which saved the film from being another random 'Oscar' movie, is this Clint's best? NO Is it this years best? No, Is it going to Win an Oscar? Yes, because it's the Oscars...",8,2,4,1 February 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Classic Before It Became Popular Again.
","Re-watching this classic might hurt the original viewing for some. The animation is not as smooth as the recent flicks like Corpse Bride or even Wallace and Gromit. Still, the originality and musical entertainment is still there. I had a friend who loved this movie, then the recent popularity with kids wearing clothing from the film apparently ruined it for him. How does that happen, don't ask me.NBC is a film that is indeed a classic and rightfully so. The animation may be stiff today, but I think it works for the world they've created. These aren't humans we're seeing. It's horrific creatures from the mind of Tim Burton and it has his stamp all over it. Seeing two worlds collide, such as Halloween and Christmas, is marvelous to see. Watching Jack as he first enters Christmas Town is like watching a kid discover the world around him when he learns to walk.The musical numbers are catchy and serve the story well. The film is a lot faster paced then I remember. It flies by really quick and before you know it Jack is delivering the toys of horror to kids all over town.The Oogie Boogie man is really well done and is still scary today as he was when I first watched this film. The voice over work is crisp and alive with emotion. It's not just some celebrity lending their voice to an animated film, it's skill voice actors doing their thing.The originality and entertainment factor in this film are high and you can see the passion the filmmakers had in bringing this nightmare alive. Burton gets a lot of credit for this film, so much that many people mistake him for the director. Instead it was Henry Selick, the director of the film Coraline. Some credit should be thrown his way, but alas, his name is hardly ever mentioned. Just ask the two guys who directed the Star Wars sequels....",8,1,2,20 July 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Know What You're Getting Yourself Into....Or Else Be Bored.
","In the 1950's Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly looked to bring down Senator Joseph McCarthy. Through much controversy they stood up against all odds and brought down the Senator.George Clooney is at the directorial chair for a second time. After taking on 'Confession of a Dangerous Mind' I was eager to see what he had in store for us a second time around. With Good Night and Good Luck, although not perfect by any means, does not disappoint.Good Night is a movie that has class, which is evident as soon as the bold black and white hits the screen. Good Night has classic film written all over it, and is a new classic film for this era. Clooney knew exactly what he wanted for this period piece, down to every little detail. Such as smoking, which seems to appear in every single scene. The smoke from the burning cigarettes look beautiful on screen, especially with the black and white. Clooney uses actual footage of McCarthy and the trials which blends in with the black and white of Good Night.Good Night And Good Luck is not for the younger crowd, as it's not very 'entertaining'. Nothing really seems to happen in it, it's geared towards an older crowd. It's odd to explain how the film made me feel, because even with nothing much happening I felt totally into the film. It could've been the content in the film or they way Clooney presented it. In the final scene, I was surprised to see it come up so fast, but knew it was going to end as soon as that scene was finished. This can't be said for all, since nothing really happens in it, you must be really intrigued by the content to not feel like the picture is dragging on and on...*cough* CAPOTE *cough*A gripe with the film is the lack of it's supporting cast. With star power such as Jeff Daniels, Robert Downey Jr and Frank Langella it would have been nice to see more of them. Robert Downey Jr. is basically useless, he really serves no purpose other then the fact that he was an actual character in that time period. The same goes for Jeff Daniels, Frank Langella although does serve a purpose and does get more of a spotlight then the others, but he could have used a little more.Good Night's strongest feature would be David Strathairn's performance. Although, it's no where near as great as Hoffman's Capote, Strathairn seems to finally get his place in the spotlight. After many years of supporting roles, Strathairn is able to break-out and shine in the film and is acknowledged just as well. He gives a powerful performance and if the film was done in any other year, then I would really be amazed by it.Good Night is a film that Clooney can be proud of. It's a big improvement over Confessions and is one of the better films of the year. You just need to know what's going on with it's story, or you can be lost throughout the film. If you're lost, then you'll ultimately be bored out of your mind. Don't go to be entertained, go to watch a film with a message, and for Strathairn's performance of Murrow.",8,3,5,2 March 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Fresh Fun Filled Entertaining Ride
","A rag-tag group of has-beens ban together to stop a ruthless villain who wants nothing to do but destroy cities killing millions. Guardians of the Galaxy was a huge gamble of Marvel, branching away from a well known formula to introduce a completely new universe, with odd creatures such as a talking raccoon, with no big A list stars and based on a property that very little people knew about. Guardians of the Galaxy was without a doubt a huge gamble and fortunately for them, it paid off in spades. Just when the Marvel films started to feel a tad stale and routine, here comes along a fresh fun filled film that is an entertaining ride from start to finish. I had a lot of fun with this film and it's been awhile since we've had fun at the movies. Dark, depressing, brooding films seem to make out summer blockbuster schedule, heck even the last two Marvel outputs were pretty dark (Captain America and Thor) but Guardians breathes new life into the summer blockbuster and more importantly the Marvel universe. The cast seems to really gel well together, even Dave Bautista, a wrestler with little acting experience, seems natural here getting some of the biggest laughs. Both Groot and Rocket Raccoon are computer marvels that have both heart and laughs. Of course finally Star Lord himself does his Han Solo with the right charm and wit. Gunn's films always blend comedy into whatever genre he seems to be diving into: Horror (Slither) Superhero (Super) and now Sci/fi-Action with Guardians. Gamora is the one character who never plays anything for laughs, her character is too serious to let the jokes fly, but she is a deadly assassin. Gunn uses a beautiful colour palette here reminiscent of Blade Runner and The Fifth Element. A welcome sight to these eyes. Guardians loves to bath in the colour it introduces to us. It loves its characters, action, self awareness and most of all, music. The music in Guardians plays into the story as well. You'll sometimes fight the urge to dance in your seat. I can't recommend this film enough. It's sheer fun that is non-stop entertainment. Chris Pratt is about to burst onto the scene and I look forward to more Guardians to come.",8,1,5,4 August 2014
Evil Dead," NOT the most terrifying film you'll ever experience.
","5 friends go up to a cabin in the woods to help one of them detox from some drugs. Going cold turkey proves to be more difficult when the uncover an ancient book of the dead, which is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. When one reads from the pages, it unleashes an evil so grotesque and profound that nothing can stop it. Of course, someone reads from it....Let me tell you where this review is coming from. I LOVE the original to death, it's my favourite horror film of all time. I've seen the red band trailer and I read the script, so I knew exactly what was going to happen. Did that hinder my enjoyment of the film? A bit, knowing some twists in the narrative makes the film lose some freshness, but I don't think the decision to stay true to the script was not all that great a choice. The film is a flawed attempt from people who love the source material. I can still give this remake a passing grade.Where the film excels is the most obvious point I or anyone else will make in their reviews. The practical effects, mainly the gore. With only a few noticeable scenes in CGI blood, this film decides to use the gore that most horror fans are use to. It looks real, feels real and is actually refreshing to see. People were sad about the news of an Evil Dead remake until the RedBand trailer came out and they saw the carnage on screen. Most of the 'shocking' gore bits are in the trailer (tongue slice, face saw, arm cut, etc) So I don't think there will be a lot of surprises here, but they excel at presenting it in such an over the top, yet serious fashion. The film looks great with some nice camera movements that add to the unsettling atmosphere. Once the crap hits the fan, it's a no holds barred blood fest. This remake plays it straight, offering little to no camp that can be found in the original series. There are obvious winks and nods to the original, involving chainsaws, hands and tweaked famous lines, but for the most part this entry tries to separate itself from the original. This is where it succeeds and fails in my opinion. The reason they are there is a nice little way of keeping them there. One character has to detox from drugs, so obviously she will be the first one who senses something is wrong here but no one will believe her cause she's coming down from the drugs. This is the little bit of character background they try to squeeze in. This film is not concerned so much with character backstories, yet they try to present some to the audience. It makes for an odd and slow build up for the carnage. When it hits, we don't care about any of them either. I even forgot that the girlfriend was there because she disappears for most of the first act only to show up for her own gruesome scene.The film is not scary at all. I was terrified of the original, this one didn't even have me jump at those cheap jump scares. I was scared of the cellar in Raimi's version. Here I think it is just gross. That's the main theme the film wants to get across it seems. It wants to gross you out, not terrify you, not make you smile, not make you care about anyone, just make you squirm at the blood. I have to give the film props for at least trying to separate itself from the original by making the story a bit of its own thing. Whether or not this works is another story. The one giant misstep, in my opinion, is when they try to make the evil and actual thing. The book reads that HE is coming, HE wants your soul, etc. The evil should not be characterized by a single demonic entity. I always envisioned the evil dead as multiple dead scary things. This is one direction that the film takes to separate itself, it fails in that aspect. Finally, the climax of the film. There is one scene just before the climax, I have to add, which is mind boggling dumb. I was rolling my eyes reading the script and had hopes they would change it, they don't. Never before has the evil been so easily defeated and never more have I been so disappointed at a story choice. After that we get a bit of a character shift and the climax is a bloody mess. Again, this chase sequence feels less Evil Dead and more Friday the 13th stalker-ish. While it is thrilling to watch and ending with a bang, it feels out of place. This Evil Dead is gruesome, but some fun is to be had. A flawed remake that could have been so much worse. For those interested, there is a little after the credits bit that, even though feels half-assed, is a nice fan service moment.",7,30,207,14 March 2013
The Evil Dead," A Horror Masterpiece - I Love This Movie.
","This film is the definition of a horror film. It's a classic and I will never, EVER, get tired of watching it. If there is one film that I could have on a desert island, this is it. If there is one film to turn a person onto horror, this is it. If there is one film that got me into film-making, this is it.First, let me say Bruce Campbell is great, even though he is basically a chump in this outing. It's Scott who is the 'bad-ass', chopping up his possessed girlfriend with an ax. Seeing his transition from film to film is great, but here is where it all started.The film is scary as hell. I know there are people out there who thought it was too cheesy to be scary, but these are probably the same people who think Jason X is one of the greatest horror films of the last decade. Seeing Ash's girlfriend sit on the floor laughing in her high pitched tone is scary, the cabin is scary, the deadites are scary.The Evil Dead is still fresh, exciting and frightening as the day it was made. This is truly 'The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror'. Forget Spider-Man, this is Raimi's true baby. The camera work and what they did for the time and the budget is mind blowing (to me anyways). I credit this film with being a huge influence on me wanting to make films. I love the camera movement in this film, every small subtle thing works perfectly and all the obvious in your face Raimi style angles are great to see for the first time (which are still used to this day in his films).While the film is not as gory as it's sequel, it does have more cringe worthy bits. The Tree Rape scene is enough to make people's skin crawl. Or how about the 'original pencil trick'. I cheered in The Dark Knight and cringed my face in The Evil Dead. How many people still talk about this film today? Hundreds of thousands. It's been a huge impact on horror (see Cabin Fever).I always wonder about what I would do in this situation and it always ends up being the same, sitting in the corner with a shotgun and shooting anything that moves. Watch The Evil Dead you will not be disappointed.",10,1,3,20 July 2009
Saw II," 'Saw 2 Is Not As Sharp Or Shocking As Original.'
","While investigating the bloody aftermath of a grizzly murder, Detective Eric Matthews has the feeling that it is the work of Jigsaw, the notorious killer who disappeared leaving a trail of bodies behind. Jigsaw is indeed back, but instead of two people locked in a room with only one unthinkable way out, there are eight. Eight strangers, unaware of their connection to each other, forced to play out a game that challenges their wits and puts their lives in jeopardy.James Wan and Leigh Whannell gave us a sharp and unique film last year, which shocked audiences around the world. It also had over-acting, major plot holes and mediocre pacing. Saw II manages to stay away from everything that was flawed with Saw, although, in doing so, it plays it too safe and loses all the shock that it wanted to give us.Much like the original, you will find some people in impossible situations, which are unique and great to watch. But Saw 2 tries to take it up a notch by putting more people in this situation, the more people you have the more clich√©s you need to put in. You get the macho guy, the mysterious guy, the pretty girl, the scared girl, the little kid, the one who knows whats going on, and the token black guy.Unlike the original, where you actually liked the characters, as annoying or over the top they may have been, here you hate them all. You know that most of them, if not all are going to die in some elaborate death, and this keeps us wanting to see more, just so we can watch them die in Jigsaw's house of horrors. Saw 2 focuses more on booby traps then clues for it's players. Even if there were more clues, the people don't care about them, or the director didn't care enough to enlighten us with them.With these clues, you would expect the people inside to pull together and try to solve this puzzle, instead they all turn on each other. One guy finds out what the first clue was and goes on a killing rampage. It's pretty much the same formula as the first, which makes this saw rusty and dull. The original had many jaws drop to the floor with it's twist ending, and going into Saw 2, you would expect the same. There is a twist, more then one to be precise, which is probably the best thing in this film. Although it never reaches the high-point of the original.How can a film that has better acting, not as many plot holes and more on Jigsaw, not be as good you might as yourself. It's basically the overall feel of the movie. I got chills throughout the entire first film, here I got one. Without ruining it, I'll just say that when the lights went on, my eyes were wide open with disbelief.Donnie Whalberg is much better in this film, then Danny Glover was in the first. In this installment, he actually has a reason to be here. Aside from the creepy Tobin Bell, Whalberg actually gives a good performance.Everyone else in the house just plays their characters they way they were written. Scream on cue, cry here, and die there.Excluding the house and all it's traps, the film only showcases one other Jigsaw predicament. A man with a bear trap on his face, who must cut out his own eye in order to get the key to unlock the contraption. Very cool, but not like the reverse bear trap on the girl's jaw from the original. Why did I like the first so much, well it was cool seeing all those little trap he put people in. That was missing from this one. The traps inside the house had wre impossible to get out of, the people were doomed and you knew it.Nevertheless, Saw 2 does end with a twist that sets up a possible third installment. Hopefully in the next one, the saw is sharper and the traps are more convincing. If I were ever in a situation with Jigsaw, I would listen to him carefully and follow his every step, I even yelled at the detective to do so. Saw 2 doesn't put to rest the ongoing debate of whether or not Dr. Gordon is alive or dead and it shouldn't, it should be up to interpretation.Saw 2 was quickly written and directed because it wanted to ride the success of the first and it shows. If time was taken and people who first brought it to us were still involved, Saw 2 could have surpassed the original. The script was written before Saw came out and had nothing to do with it. Once Saw became a hit, a few changes were made and it became Saw 2. So when a script is not written directly for the sequel purpose, you know you're in for trouble.",6,2,3,13 November 2005
Clash of the Titans," A Missed Opportunity.
","Found in a coffin with his dead mother as a child, Perseus is raised by a fisherman. Persues lives a quiet and normal life despite wanting to know where he came from. As mortals begin to rebel against the Gods, the Gods lash back by having Hades do his thing, which includes releasing the Kraken, unless the people sacrifice the princess Andromeda. Persues joins a small crew of men to go and stop this madness. I love Greek mythology, I find it so interesting and when I watched the original Clash of the Titans when I was a child, the most memorable scene was Medusa's lair. Hearing about the remake made me excited, but it seems the filmmakers went the old generic Hollywood route and went for senseless action and and the cash grab that is 3-D. I don't remember everything about the original, but I do know that it is more entertaining then this forgettable swords and sandals 'epic'. I use the word epic loosely because the film does not feel as big as it's story. I don't know if Lord of the Rings has spoiled my 'people on a quest adventure' but this film doesn't hold up to what it should be and it feels like a miss opportunity. The biggest problem is the film lacks any kind of heart. I felt nothing for the forgettable characters, I can't even remember their names. The conflict didn't feel like it was raised to the right stake for me to care about what happens. There is no time spent with the Princess, why do I care if she gets sacrificed. I felt nothing for Perseus and his family, or his so called love interest. Which feels fake and tacked on to appeal to the females in the audience. Worthington has literally exploded onto the big screen from nowhere. His acting chops haven't been tested yet and this film does nothing to try and provoke some kind of emotion from it's lead character. He screams and jumps from place to place and cries about wanting to defeat people as a man and nothing more. What should I have expected though right? Well, for one thing I was hoping to like all the Gods. Yet they managed to screw that up to. The Gods are hardly in it. My favourite God Poseidon stands in the background and has one line. I should be thankful he got that much because every other god just stand around in the background and serve no purpose.The two main Gods that get the spotlight are Zeus and Hades. Played by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. Neeson does nothing, he just stands around and yells the famous trailer line 'Release the Kraken'. Fiennes does a good job and stands out, but at the same time he is simply playing Lord Voldemort and the connection is obvious. What the film does offer is what most people going to see it want. Action. The special effects work and the action sequences are entertaining. The Medusa scene is nowhere near as memorable as the original and doesn't feel as important and the Kraken sequence, while spectacular is over far too soon. It's all about him getting out of the water, that's it. I was expecting Jack Sparrow to be stuck in his teeth. In the end this film is sloppy and had problem from the script to the last edit. It's clunky and has no heart, the special effects and action sequences are entertaining, but not enough for one to invest their time into. Looking back on this film, there is not one moment that jumps out at me as impressive or note-worthy. More mythology, more character development and more story driven aspects would have helped the film immensely. Instead we get this Hollywood Blockbuster that fuels the fire of what a lot of people dislike. Oh and I saw it in 2-D.",5,2,4,8 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," A Theatre Experience I'll Never Forget.
","A couple decide to document their nights while they sleep, after they hear strange noises that they believe to be a haunting.I respect this film, for the fact that it was shot for less than 20,000, had absolutely no marketing campaign and has become a huge success based on word of mouth and the audience demanding to see it. If only other studios would follow suit and listen to people demanding to see movies they want to see, maybe there wouldn't be so much crap out there. Paranormal Activity is shot like Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, REC, Cannibal Holocaust, etc. If any of those films gave you motion sickness, you might want to skip this one. Half the film is shot while they sleep, so the film is on a tri-pod, the other half is them walking around with it. So if you've never been a fan of those films, skip this one. Second, the film is not as scary as people make it out to be. Instead, it is one creepy and suspenseful film, that seeing in a theatre, only heightened my enjoyment of it. The audience I went with, all had a collective 'Oh My God'. I could hear it every time something creepy happened. You could literally feel everyone in the theatre holding their breath every time they went to sleep. Again, if you are the type of person who wants to watch a film and not hear a peep out of anyone else, skip this film.Now the film itself, shot in one week, small (very small) budget and every penny of it went towards the special effects. The special effects are what sell the film, if you don't buy them, the film will not creep you out. They looked real and impressive enough to push the film into a successful goal, which is to scare people. If you are already afraid of the dark, this film will not help you. Every creek, thump, noise you hear in your house will now have you thinking twice. Less is more, The Blair Witch Project uses this, as does Paranormal Activity. The two leads, are haunted by a demon, one we never see, only hear. Whenever you go into a horror film, as a kid you would close your eyes in fear. Big mistake, because it's the ears you need to be covering. The sound is what makes you jump, hear nothing, fear nothing. The sound design behind this film is what is scary people, accompanied by the visuals (memorable scenes with the powder and bed sheets).As the film progresses, the haunting gets worse. I don't want to give anything away, and I urge you to not watch the trailer. I watched the trailer and was waiting for those things to happen, it took away from the general fear. Not knowing what to expect will make this film that much better, that much creepier and that much more entertaining. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was either, the lead male had some comic relief dialogue, the ease the tension. The couple are believable, the hand held camera angle works here and the fear will set in. I applaud Paranormal Activity, for not only becoming an unheard of success, but for being one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.Bravo.",8,301,531,24 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Weirdest Film of 2005
","First of all, let me say that this film is nothing like the original, there were so many things that were not in this film that were in the original, which made the film seem very short. Through out the whole film you know what is going to happen and when you don't see it you kind of feel let down, but then the film goes on after the ending of the original and you get new material on the screen.This film has BURTONS style written all over it, the opening score, the Buckette's house, evening the references to his other films are in here. (Peewee, Edward). It's always a treat to see a Burton film because his sense of style is always 'twisted' and unique.The music other then Elfman's score was sung by the Oompa Loompas and they were short and only happened after a child was disposed of. Of course it was funny to see that little guy sing and do the little dances, but I still say that the original Oompa Loompas were great and should never have changed. I never read the book, but in the movie it shows the back story to the Oompa Loompas, living in some kind of jungle, it was neat to see that.In saying that, this film, unlike the original which centered on Charlie, deals more with Wonka. Going to the jungle or Loompa Island and finding the Oompa Loompas, hell even going as far back as to show Willy as a child and his father the great Mr. Lee, or as someone said in the audience. 'Holy Sh*t, it's Dooku'. As stated before this film is full of references to other movies and one is 2001: AOS, in the TV room (the big white room) it has 2001 on the screen and I know that I was the only one in that theater that knew what it was.So Depp as Wonka eh, well this is the part that scares me, he was freaky. Not like the original Wonka at all. He sounds like a child, looks pale and acts like a child. Depp was quoted as saying that the inspiration was a game show host locked up for 20 years and then finally let out and I believe it. He was great, had the right funny/scary/weird sense and look to him. Of course Wonka and Depps performance is the most weird part of this film, that doesn't take apart from the fact that the film itself is weird, it goes up there with any Lynch or Cronenberg film as being F'd up. Not in an I don't understand way, in a this is F'd up way.Which film do I prefer, hard to say cause the original is a classic and I never read the book, but as good as the film is there were some parts that I could of done without. Mainly one being Burton showing the other children leaving the factory. Agustus is covered in Chocolate, Violette is still blue, and I won't tell you about the other two, but what I liked about the original is that you never knew what happened to them, if those Oompa Loompas really did take care of those kids or if there were something darker going on in that factory. All in all, the kids did the job of acting like kids and the parents did the job of acting like parents, so nothing special there.Depp's performance, the sets, comparing to the original and Burton behind the camera are the reasons to see this film, but if you loved a lot of things about the original....like Slugsworth, the floating/burping, Wonkas office, then you'll end up being disappointed because they are not present in Burtons film.",7,0,1,3 August 2005
Big Fish," One Of My Favourite Burton Films.
","I always wondered what a Tim Burton film would look like without all the Gothic undertones and scenery with that scary vibe throughout. I always thought Pee-wee's Big Adventure was one of the scariest films ever made so that fits into the category as well. Well, Big Fish I think was the first film to answer my question. Don't even try to say Mars Attacks! or Planet of the Apes.Big Fish is a spectacle to see. It's beautiful and heartfelt. Granted it still does have that Burton eerie vibe, let's face it, it will always be there, but it's also one of his more mature works. Burton has a great body of work, all of his films seem to have their place in someone's heart and Big Fish feels like one of those films that is a critical success but no one ever mentions it when they think of Burton's best work. It's a shame because it truly is.Ewan McGregor is in the lead role as a younger version of Albert Finney who is on his death bed. His son is trying to connect to him, to get to know the real father. It seems that all his father ever did was tell this stories to his kid that were always too mystical to be true. Or were they? The ending to Big Fish is great and always puts a smile on my face. It's a feel good movie that makes you smile, even when there is tragedy soon to be seen. And yes, there is a BIG FISH in the film, so the title is relevant.The film has a strong supporting cast, including the ever present Helena Bonham Carter, Jessica Lang, Billy Crudup, Dann DeVito and Steve Buscemi. All play their roles well and never feel out of place in this wacky tale.With all Burton films they seem to fall just short of true greatness, just shy of being called genius or a masterpiece. I don't really get it, all the ingredients are there, but the final step is never really taken. Big Fish is another film of his that falls into this category.",9,0,0,20 July 2009
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight Breaks Comic Book Adaptation Barriers.
","A new villain is in town and he's a homicidal clown known as The Joker. Batman must do everything in his power to stop him, while Harvey Dent takes the lime light as the new face of good.Not since The Matrix Reloaded have I been hyped to see a film. Where Reloaded failed to deliver on that hype, The Dark Knight soars with bright colours. Is it everything that a Batman fan wants it to be? Yes. Is it everything a film lover wants it to be? Yes. The Dark Knight takes you on a ride through action, suspense, humour and drama. It rests in a genre that makes you suspend a little reality. This is the comic book world, where there are green monsters, flying men in tights and teenagers swinging around in New York. Very bright, very over the top and very fun. The Dark Knight turns all of this on it's head and delivers a raw, realistic and genre defining film. Along with Iron Man, The Dark Knight sets a new standard for comic book adaptations.Without a doubt, every review the one will read will praise the chaotic energy that Heath Ledger gives in the role of The Joker. Can a role really live up to such hype? Yes, and this is it. Heath Ledger goes where many people do not. He becomes the character, he becomes the Joker. Nicholson played the part well, but Ledger embodies it. Every little quirk, from the flicker in the eyes, raising the eyebrows or using his tongue to wet his lips, draws you into the character. It's safe to say the Ledger does indeed steal the show from everyone and the film knows this too. It's a shame we will never see where Ledger career would have gone, because this role is juicy and Ledger nails it.That's not to say that everyone else isn't good either. Bale brings more tragedy into the heart of both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Even with the world around him crumbling down, he still stands for good. Michael Cain reaches more depths with simple looks in his eyes. Both Alfred and Fox have moral dilemmas in this film, both play them well. Oldman has more screen time here then he did in Begins and he takes the character of Gordon to new heights. We know him as a good cop that doesn't conform to the corruption, but here his range explodes into more emotional decision making. Aaron Eckhart has the most troubling task here. He must play two completely different roles, within the same character, and we have to believe the transformation. His anger and hate mixes well with his confusion in what to do after his 'accident'. Finally Gyllenhaal, replaces Holmes. The character finally has some more range, but Gyllenhaal doesn't get enough screen time to bring it to us. Again, it's sad to say but this is the weakest link. It may just simply be the character.Everything about this film hits the nail on the head. The acting is top notch, no longer are roles in comic book films cheesy or one dimensional. These character are psychotic, dangerous, funny, defenseless and everything more you can ask for. Back when these characters could never be taken seriously, now are awing us with their presence. The script is fabulous. Every line of dialogue spoken by The Joker is chilling, now times that by ten because Ledger somehow gives the lines more chills. The action sequences are entertaining. We have car chases, fight scenes, race against the clock bits and anything else The Joker can come up with. With ever scheme he tops himself in the absurdity and craziness. More action then it's predecessor, more drama, more villainous and more dark. This isn't your Adam West Batman. This is Nolan's Batman.Nolan has recreated what once was lost. When nipples and bad ice puns were where these characters were, now are set back in the right motion. Nolan has given us, not only the best Batman movie, but the best comic book movie. You don't need high theatrics to create a great comic book film, you need substance. The Dark Knight has boatloads of this. I found myself wanting more of the Joker, I was so enthralled by the character and the performance. I found myself in awe of where the film goes, in terms of plot and character development. I applaud Nolan for not making a happy go lucky film, but for given The Dark Knight his true colours. He's a tormented soul, the events in this film push him to the limit, to his breaking point.There are some minor setbacks though. I wasn't too thrilled with the bits in Hong Kong. Trims here and there could have saved the running time, which clocks in at 2 hours and 30 some odd minutes. As well as too many scene where the camera decides to spin around the characters a couple times, it gets a tad annoying.The Dark Knight will break barriers. Comic book films will be more serious, more character and plot driven then CGI laden. Heath Ledger will earn an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a sick and twisted clown. People will want to see what happens in this world and the people in it. The Dark Knight does create a new world, a world of fear and excitement. Where in some cases you kind of secretly want to root for the bad guy. This is a world I applaud, this is a film that I applaud. This is a perfect example of what a film should be.",9,18,38,18 July 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Fantastic Art film...Mediocre Film.
","So, I finally saw this weird film and I still don't know what to think of it. I'm not sure if I liked it or not. One of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It's brilliant visually, but......nothing happens. The film has no substance, and it tries to fool you into thinking it does. The classic 'so weird it must mean something' fits this one like a tie. It's hard to explain, but something about this movie I didn't like. There is VERY little story, and the little that is there is not interesting. It's an art flick, and a big leap in sci-fi films at the time, but for entertainment purposes I would have to pass on this one.I understand that it was not meant to be understood, but why make a film like that? Maybe I'll 'get it' ten years down the road.Very difficult to rate this film, because as an art film it warrants a 10/10, but as a film for entertainment value I see myself giving it a 4/10.",7,3,4,14 February 2005
Blood Diamond," 'Leo Scores Twice In One Year - One Of The Years Best'
","Archer is a diamond smuggler who is thrown in jail after being caught on a routine smuggle. Solomon is a fisherman who is captured by guerrillas and is forced to mining diamonds. Solomon comes across a rare diamond and decides to hide it. A raid occurs and the 'RUF' and the diamond miners are thrown in jail. This is where Archer and Solomon meet and where the word about the diamond being buried is let loose.Blood Diamond is the second film to feature Leonardo DiCaprio in the year 2006. The other was 'The Departed' and both films found their way to the Oscars, with Leo's performance in Diamond going up for Best Actor. While I personally believe the stronger performance was in The Departed, Blood Diamond still is an awakening to the viewer and not only send out a message, but entertains its audience at the same time. Not many films can do this, but Diamond executes it very well.Zwick's previous film was 'The Last Samurai' with Tom Cruise. That film was good, but it left me with an awkward feeling. Everything was good until it's bogus ending, in which Tom Cruise, the one American, is the only person who survives the onslaught at the film's climax. All emotion is basically stripped at the end. With Diamond, Zwick learns from his mistakes in Samurai and is actually able to convey some emotion in this film. With a depressing story being told, Zwick needed actors who were able to translate this emotion, he found them in DiCaprio and Hounsou.Both actors received critical acclaim for their performances and rightfully so. Hounsou captures the screen with every minute he graces it. Playing a man who is tripped away from his family and then learns his son is captured and turned into a soldier is demanding, but Hounsou depicts everything perfectly, even stealing some scenes away from DiCaprio. DiCaprio scored big with 'The Departed' and here is smacks another one out of the park. Before the film came out all I heard were negative things about him in this film, most people nitpicking on his accent. Truth be told, it's pitch perfect and is consistent all throughout the film. DiCaprio is intense and believable all throughout and deserves his Oscar nomination, even if it is for the wrong film.Blood Diamond feels like two films, one wants to entertain the audience with it's thrilling action scenes and gun battles galore; while the other feels the need to beat us over the head with the message that we may have blood on our hands. While the film does a fairly good job at balancing the two, at times it's just blatantly obvious that the one outweighs the other. By the way, it's the message and not the action. Through dialogue and actions from the characters might as well just turn to the screen and tell us that 'This is bad'.Straight from the start you know how real and brutal the film is going to be. It's relentless with it's killings, most notably on the village raid in the opening scenes, tying in with the message that the film is trying to get out there. On a technical aspect the film is beautiful, from the desert grounds to the green forests. The art direction and cinematography are both breathtaking and add to the overall authentic experience this film offers.Blood Diamond, is a film that delivers what it promises. It delivers its message when it needs to and the action when it needs too, only in a few instances it faults. With great performances and beautifully filmed scenes, it's no surprise that Blood Diamond is one of the years best films. Although it could have been a little shorter, clocking in at 2 hours and 15 minutes. The film tends to drag in the final 20 minutes. I can recommend Blood Diamond, it will most certainly entertain.",8,1,2,7 May 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Best Film of 2004
","Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.Well, if you're familiar with Kaufman's work, then you know what your getting yourself into. This is just as weird if not weirder than his previous work, Being John Malkovich. I knew what I was getting myself into, but 90% of the movie I was saying to myself 'What the hell is going on?', but in a good way. It opens with Joel calling in sick for work and going on a different train, heading for Montauk. He meets Clementine and they hit it off. Now this is about 15 minutes into the movie, then out of nowhere come the opening credit sequence. I will admit, I thought it would be different, but I'm glad that it is the way it is, the movie is 80% of the time in Joel's head.If you think you know Carrey, think again. This movie is his best performance, better than Majestic, Truman show and all of his comedic roles (which is what I love him for). Just looking at his face from the second we see him, we feel his pain, then like that, we feel his joy, embarrassment and hate. Just awesome acting on his part, and Winslet was great as the free spirit who never seems satisfied. The supporting cast all work well in their small, yet important roles. Oscar nominations for Winslet and (crosses fingers) Carrey.But if I were to bet any money on any Oscar nominations it would obviously be the writing, what a mess, but beautifully constructed. You think to yourself, is that scene really necessary? Then ten minutes later you think to yourself how brilliant it was, that's beautiful, crazy, give me whatever he's smoking kind of writing. Charlie Kaufman's writing is always clever, but this time he's one-upped himself by making something simultaneously bizarre and emotionally engaging. It seemed like his earlier movies were clever for the sake of cleverness, but 'Eternal Sunshine' manages to dazzle you with it's originality and it's poignancy. The fact that this movie was able to wrap such profound loss, emotional tenderness, and hope in such a self-consciously stylized package illustrates the incredible talent of the people behind it.Michel Gondry's use of vibrant coloring and quick camera movement give the film a very involving first hand feeling. The constant use of the handy cam is very all involving for the viewer, and I suppose that this is exactly what is needed in such a personal movie. His work on the dream sequences is incredible as well. He decides to use more practical effects than what we see today with computers. Eternal Sunshine is a tragic, yet beautiful film that sits at the top of my list of 'Best of 2004'.",10,95,120,13 February 2005
Alice in Wonderland," Weak and Uneven, A Disappointment From Burton.
","Alice returns to that wonderful world of wonder she visited when she was a child. This time with no memory of being there before. It is written that she will overthrow the evil Red Queen and return peace to the land.The pairing of Tim Burton and Alice in Wonderland had a lot of people smile with big grins. It seems like a perfect match. Burton's visual flair would seem to perfectly fit this weird and wonderful world. People were right, Burton's vision is indeed what one would expect and it's the highlight of an otherwise uninspiring film that feels flat and weak. As a Depp/Burton film, it lacks the originality and freshness of their prior works. Depp is wonderful in the role of the Mad Hatter, but at the same time it feels like we've seen this performance before. Depp usually seems to disappear into his roles, but his mannerism are really apparent here. It felt like he took bits of Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka, then made it a little bit more insane. It works, but at the same time it feels old. As for Alice, the relatively unknown actress Mia Wasikowska is boring, bland, emotionless and the wrong choice for Alice. It was hurtful to have her try and carry the film, she couldn't. On the opposite side of the spectrum. Helena Bonham Carter is outstanding as the Red Queen. She stands out in the film, which is full of hit or miss performances. The CGI fits the fantasy element of the story, but at times they feel a bit too cartoony. This takes away from the weight of the characters and you immediately know that it's too fake, even for this fantasy world. While the film is visually pleasing, the story is severely lacking. I found myself wanting the film to end a bit sooner than it did.The 3-D in this film was pretty bad. My experience with 3-D films in theatres have been G- Force, Avatar and now Alice in Wonderland. Out of all three of those films, this one comes in dead last. I found it hard to concentrate on certain things, as others had motion blur and it hurt my eyes a bit. Avatar is 3-D done right, Alice is 3-D to sell tickets.Fans of the original story might find this one a bit lacking. To equate this film to another one in Burton's catalogue, it would be around the same level of Mars Attacks! or Planet of the Apes. A mediocre film with a few good elements. As a whole the film will please the young teenage target audience that will gush over Depp and love the visual style. But those looking for a good entertaining story, you'll be disappointed.",5,5,14,5 March 2010
Avatar," It's Gorgeous, It's Entertaining, It's A Visual Orgasm.
","A paraplegic marine is sent to a program that would give him the ability to walk, as well as be over ten feet tall with blue skin. He becomes a Na'vi, these native like creatures that live on Pandora, a moon that scientists and marines want to invade to grab some minerals that are worth lots and lots of money. I must say that before I saw Avatar, in IMAX 3-D no less, I made an effort to avoid every trailer, every TV spots and anything regarding the plot. It was difficult because everything on the internet and in the media was AVATAR for the months leading up to it. But I managed to pull it off, knowing that knowing nothing about it would probably heighten my experience. It did. Was I expecting to be blown away? I was, but did Cameron pull it off? For the most part. The film, from a visual and technical stand point is marvelous. Is it the next step in film-making? It looks like it, but it feels more like a first step and not the giant leap people have been waiting for.Avatar stars the next big star, Sam Worthington. His twin brother has died and the government needs him to operate this avatar that is worth millions. Since he is genetically identical, they figured it would be fine. Sigourney Weaver is the person spearheading the operation, she is always butting heads with Stephen Land, the Colonel and Giovanni Ribisi, the head honcho of everything. She wants to learn and comes to love the natives, they want to blow them all up. There is our conflict ladies and gentlemen. Where is Worthington in all this? He becomes emotionally attached to one of the Na'vi creatures and fights on their side. I don't blame him because for the first time ever, I was sexually attracted to a creature created from motion capture, played by Trekkie Zoe Saldana. So Avatar is the big game changer, or so they say. Let me say that I wanted this film to be my Star Wars. I wasn't alive when that film came out, so I've never really had that AWE moment. Lord of the Ring came close and Avatar has come even closer. But it never really reached it. Cameron and his team have created a world with so much detail that you'll probably have to see the film twice just to break the surface. He paints the film in beautiful colours, even at night. Everything illuminates beautifully, and it was a smart move. Using 3-D technology, Cameron knew he had to brighten the picture, since everyone would have these dark classes on their eyes. His camera, which he created, gave him an edge on using the technology and he uses it well. It's not gimmicky like G-Force or lame like Harry Potter. The film has many memorable sequences. I had heard the final battle is off the wall crazy and while it was well done and looked great, I didn't feel like it was 'off the wall crazy'. Seeing Worthington try and tame a creature of flight was one of the more memorable moments. Every moment on Pandora is beautiful and you literally have no idea what to expect. Cameron has created something new here and I commend him for that. In a year full of sequels and load obnoxious films that feel stale, Cameron has created a world that is new, fresh and bright. The story is something we've seen before, but we connect well enough with the characters that we care about the end battle. Did I care in Transformers? Hell no.Cameron has yet to disappoint me, he continuously pushes the edge of technology and film in general. He takes risks and he manages to pull it off every time, despite the nay sayers. There have been millions of them, they doubted Titanic and when he proved them wrong, they doubted him again with Avatar. In my opinion, he's proved them wrong again, but I can see a lot of people not liking the film as much, The reason? A lot of people are having gripes with the story. It's not bad, it's just been done. I don't care if it's been done, as long as it's done well. Avatar does it well. People tell me that they don't expect the film to blow them away, it might not. I totally expect people to be 50/50 on this film. In the end, Avatar is a film you need to see. I saw it in 3-D and in IMAX, I went in knowing nothing about it. I had no idea that they all controlled the Na'vi creatures, I had no idea about why they were there or even that he had a twin. Was the film worth it? It sure was, the experience is one to marvel in. This film was a film made for IMAX, and in the words of Cameron himself, made for 3-D. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did if it were a regular screen. Everyone's talking about it, everyone's seeing it, so be a part of the phenomenon.",8,4,10,18 December 2009
Grindhouse," Everything I Could Ever Want And More In A Film.
","If you are reading this review then I'm assuming you have some vague idea of what a grindhouse film is, if not, look it up then get back to me. For those familiar with the cheesy B movie genre, you will know exactly what to expect, for those who've never seen a grindhouse film, well, let's just say you're in for a surprise. 'Grindhouse' is a full blown, in your face orgasm that never ends; and when it does you don't want it to. Tarantino and Rodriguez pulled off exactly what they promised; delivering a film that is not only a fun experience, but a hilarious, grotesque, thrilling, chilling and maybe even vomit inducing experience. It's hard to say which film I liked better; they both have their own unique style and cheese factor. Right from the beginning we get a small taste of what the rest of the film has in store. The film starts with the 'Machete' trailer, it's over-the-top in every sense of the word and if you get the joke, you'll love every minute of it. The entire film is full of nods to the genre, whether it be random posters in the background and a character wearing a shirt with the cover of 'faster pussy cat, kill kill' on it. I'm not the biggest fan of grindhouse films, as I've only seen a few, but 'Grindhouse' has definitely opened my eyes and has ignited my thirst for more. While I have seen a few grindhouse films, I can safely say that 'Death Proof' has a more grindhouse vibe out of the two. Its look and feel was more gritty, while 'Planet Terror' was simply carnage on the screen.'Planet Terror' has more humour and gore out of the two, which would be expected from the trailers. It has zombies and a woman with a machine gun for a leg. If you can't laugh at a guy who takes people's testicles who double cross him, or a sex scene in which a wooden leg makes an appearance and then the reel suddenly goes missing, then why the hell are you watching this movie? 'Death Proof' was more intense out of the two, one particular scene has one character hanging onto the hood of a car for her life and Stuntman Mike tries to run them off the road; it's exciting and scary at the same time.Kurt Russell stands out in the whole cast, from both features. His homicidal and caring take on the psycho is chilling and funny, he's a psychotic mess and loves every minute of it. Rose McGowan, Tarantino, Marley Shelton and Michael Parks all make appearances in both films, with Michael Biehn making a small appearance in one of the fake trailers. Rounding out the rest of the cast is Freddy Rodriguez, Josh Brolin, Rosario Dawson, Naveen Andrews and Tom Savini, to just name a few on a list that goes on and on. There are a few more cameo spots that I won't ruin for you, but they are quite comical.The fake trailers themselves are worthy enough for stand alone films. In some cases the trailers themselves are more gruesome then the feature films. Leave it to Eli Roth to do something like that, his 'Thanksgiving' trailer is where people will either laugh their heads off or vomit into a bag. Zombie's outing is 'Werewolf Women of the SS', which showcases Nazis, werewolves, and naked women. Edgar Wright supplies us with the third trailer, in which it tells you 'Don't see it alone'. The gore factor is high and in full drive here. Without a doubt this film will have you either cheering for more, or well, cheering for more. Is there ever such a thing as too much gore? Not in this homage to exploitation flicks of the 70's. If you honestly think there is too much gore, then why are you watching this film? It tells you up front that is about horrific violence, sexuality, and drugs. This film has a checklist and knocks everything down as it runs it course. If you're sitting in the theatre rolling your eyes at the ridiculousness of what is being shown on the screen, again I ask why are you here? Nothing in this film can be taken seriously, nor should it. Things aren't suppose to make sense, that was the beauty of those films from back then and the directors know this and capture it perfectly. Both films do have a missing reels segment, both happen at parts where something sexual is about to take place.Being a horror movie buff makes me appreciate the film on a whole new level. Both Tarantino and Rodriguez show that they can handle the genre and this time they've raised the bar. If you thought SAW III was gory, just wait till you see this flick. Everything, from gun shots, to stab wounds in 'Planet Terror' has blood gushing left right and centre. Bodies are torn apart, faces fall off, testicles are cut off and fall off, people explode fingers are bitten off, people are shot, so on and so fourth. In 'Death Proof' the deaths, which are few all happen within the vehicles. Dane Cook will be happy to see there is a scene in which a female character takes a tire to the face. Along with that, another gets thrown out of a car, someone loses a leg and another gets their face smashed in. Everything works for 'Grindhouse, the scratches on the film reels do not distract at all, instead it adds to the overall experience, an experience that I haven't had at a theatre in a long time. 'Grindhouse' brings back the feelings that were once lost from the movies and beats out '300' as the most fun you'll have at the movies this year, and probably for awhile.",10,180,284,4 April 2007
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," The Best & Worst Twilight.
","This is the first time I sat in a theatre to watch a Twilight movie. I think the theatre experience maybe helped me enjoy the film more than I should have. Nevertheless, Breaking Dawn Part II is not only the best entry in the franchise, it's also the worst. How can that be? For a good 20 minutes, the film tries to be daring and does something different. Yet it is all undone by playing it safe and ruining what came before it. I have to stress that yes, this film did NOT have to be broken up into two. The first film was an hour and a half of filler, followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness. This entry is an hour and a half of build-up, followed by 20 minutes of awesomeness X10, followed by the worst decision the series has ever made to date.I have seen every Twilight movie, I'm not a fan, nor am I a hater. I'm always objective when it comes to these movies. The highest rating I've given one of them is a 5, that went to Eclipse. Breaking Dawn Part II could have easily gotten a 7 from me, had they had the balls to go through with what we were witnessing. A twist so inane, that it actually made me boo at the screen. I don't think I've ever booed at any movie in the theatre before, so congratulations Breaking Dawn Part II, you achieved something. Now, that awesomeness that I was speaking of, it is indeed awesome. I was cheering, I was laughing, I was having a blast. The people around me, I'm assuming fans, were gasping at the carnage they were witnessing. I had a giant smile on my face. Did the creators finally take the series in a bold direction? Did they finally have the balls to do something different? Yes, they did, but then they ruin it. I can't stress how awful that made me feel.K-Stew, finally has something to do other than swoon over Edward, resist the urges from Jacob and act like a whiny teenager. She is a vampire, so she has to learn to be one, although it seems she has no problem with the thirst and heightened senses. There is no struggle for her, which makes this whole aspect a bit shallow. Jacob, unfortunately has nothing to do in this entry other than glare at everyone who comes near Renesmee. So the character shifts his focus from one girl to the next, nothing more for him to do, yawn. Speaking of Renesmee (stupid name), we have what is probably one of the creepiest babies to ever grace the silver screen. Why they chose to use CGI for the face of the baby, other than using a normal one is beyond me. It looks unnatural and comical. The movement doesn't flow and for some reason they decide to keep this CGI face with the kid as she grows older until they finally have the older actress in the role.As with every Twilight film, there are moments of unintentional laughter, bad acting, dialogue and CGI. Michael Sheen seems to be having fun acting like a complete weirdo and the others seem to be happy they are finished with this series. Now, to be completely honest, this entire saga could have been told in three movies. Twilight for the set up, Eclipse for conflict, Breaking Dawn for the closure. Eliminate the pointless New Moon and condense these two movies into one. Twilight is finally over. No more sparkling vampires, no more team Edwards or team Jacobs and no more shirtless scenes of young men. Good bye Twilight, I do not look forward to the inevitable remakes.",5,136,338,20 November 2012
Invictus," Well Made, But Completely Forgettable
","Nelson Mandela has been released from prison and was voted as the South African president. Wanting to unite his country, he found a way to do so with rugby and in the South African team captain, Francois Pienaar.Morgan Freeman was born to play this role, he knew so, and that's why he produced this film. A dream project of his, waiting for someone to take the job of directing, his old friend Clint Eastwood steps in. Who says no to Clint? Especially Freeman, who under Eastwood's direction won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Invictus, William Ernest Henley, which is read by Mandela in the film, is well crafted and has a strong lead role. Unfortunately, the film is a by the numbers product that you seem to forget once you leave the theatre.My main problem with the film is the lack of emotion. I couldn't care for any of the characters in this film, save for Freeman, who as I stated does an excellent job. Matt Damon, who is shown on the poster, has the supporting role here. But he is given absolutely nothing to do except play rugby. His character has no story to him, but aren't we suppose to believe in him? After all, Mandela does. He gives him inspiration to win the world cup. Matt Damon does an alright job, but nothing worth mentioning. The same goes for the rest of the cast, they seem to be there just because the story is based on real life. Eastwood knows how to direct a film, the Academy seems to think so too, so you know going into it that it well be well crafted. This is Eastwood's first step into a semi sports movie genre. The sport is rugby, and after watching the film, I still have no idea how to play it. The final act of the game is in slow motion as well, clich√©d? You know it. You can hear every grunt from every player. It is elongated to the point of annoyance. The rugby sequences did not pull me in, nor did I care for who was going to win. It doesn't feel like he is trying to step out of his comfort zone either. It feels like an Eastwood movie, take that as you want. The best parts of the film, are when Freeman commands the screen. His presence is more interesting and entertaining than any of the rugby scenes. Speaking of a rugby scenes, I must say that every 'epic' shot of the fans in the stands looked horribly fake. At some points I thought I was watching a PS3 game. It really took me out of the experience of the film. If the film were a bit shorter and more focused (is it a sports film or character driven film?) than I could maybe invest my interest. It seemed to balance both as nice as it could, but ultimately gave out to one more than the other and unfortunately it's the weaker part. Eastwood chooses to sidestep more important things in the film. Is this because of the script? Are we suppose to want to keep watching Mandela inspire a rugby team to unite nation? The racial undertones are there at the beginning, then completely forgotten. In the end, I wanted more from this film.The film is not bad, it's moderately good. Some scenes are actually inspiring, but that's more because of Freeman and not the generic script. I guess I wanted a little bit more from this one. Everyone involved made it seem like it should have been a great success, instead it comes off as something that everyone just decided to throw together. This is another film that belongs in that category of good, but not good enough for me to want to recommend it to you for theatre viewing.",6,108,175,17 December 2009
Super 8," Quality entertainment for everyone.
","In a small town in Ohio, a group of kids are making a zombie flick using an 8mm camera. During their shooting, a train is derailed and something escapes. Odd things start happening around the town and the military arrive to cover up a government secret. Told through the eyes of young kids, Super 8, which is also set in the late 70's, will instantly feel nostalgic. That's the one word I've been hearing thrown around when people describe this film. Spielberg is the producer, so people instantly make a connection between this film and his previous works. The underlying feeling is there, but this film has much more to offer than just nostalgia. In the first few scenes, we know the main character has lost someone in his life. It's always hard to convey something has happened without any dialogue, this film tells us so much with so little. The main character is missing something from his life, will this adventure be able to fill that hole? Will he be able to let go of the things that are holding him back in the past? He has a crush on this cute girl, who just so happens to be in the film they are shooting. Their relationship is cute to watch grow, from awkwardness, to understanding, to needing. They are kids, so their relationship isn't based on lust, which most romantic comedies and blockbuster films will be about this year. Instead, it's an innocence that makes the relationship spark. Abrams manages to invoke the same feelings we all had when we watched Spielberg films as kids, yet he is able to keep his own creative touch in tact. It never feels like a rip-off, or even a homage. Instead it feels like it belongs with those films, side by side. The mystery behind this film is what fuels the fire. Leading up to the release, all we know about it was that it was a monster flick of some kind. A companion piece to Abrams produced film Cloverfield maybe? Elle Fanning, plays the young Alice, who is the object of Joe's affection. Joe is played by newcomer Joel Courtney. Both do a great job in their roles, Fanning more so, who I enjoy more than her famous sister, Dakota. I would have loved a bit more bickering and interaction between the kids though. The film is more of a family centric piece. The relationship between Joe and his father, the Deputy, is less than perfect. We are given so many answers at the beginning of the film and later on we are revealed the questions. A film that manages to ignite many mysteries that resolves them later is great in my book. The climax of the film is a little less than stellar. It ends on a more family friendly note than what one might hope. Then again, this is 'Spielberg' right? Super 8 is full of thrilling sequences and charming performances. It will grab your inner child (for those of us who grew up with Spielberg films) and get him/her cheering. Super 8, with some minor problems is one of the best films this year. Abrams is a talented guy, which we already knew from Star Trek. Here he shows us he attention to detail and how much he admires the craft. Super 8 is indeed super and it gets an 8 from me.",8,1,3,14 June 2011
Up," Is Anyone Really Surprised That This Film Is Good?
","After living in his home for most of his life, Carl is suddenly surrounded by skyscrapers and construction. They want to buy his house so they can tear it down and build a retirement home. He will have none of this and decides to use thousands of balloons to literally lift his house 'up' and soar to a place he's been dreaming of going since a kid.There's a bit more to the plot, but I don't want to divulge that information. Going into the film not knowing about it might have a stronger impact on you. Up, which is yet another fascinating film from the geniuses at Pixar is vibrant with colour, full of laughs, tugs on the heart strings and is an adventure for both kids and adults. I never thought a film that had to really old characters in the lead roles would appeal to the young ones, but Up surprised me. In fact, it really surprised me, hearing about the concept I thought that Pixar finally had a dud on their hands. Nope, not this time.Up is one of my favourite Pixar films, up their with last years Wall-E and The Incredibles. The film is unique and inspiring. I doubt you'll find such quality film making from any other animated film, Pixar has set the bar time and time again. Up, while not visually stunning or powerful as last years Wall-E takes a different route and uses vibrant colours to draw attention to itself. The characters are cartoonish and the story itself could never be based on any reality and for a film about an old guy in a house with balloons, it's mighty adventurous.Every Pixar film has a message that their cleverly slip into the excitement and Up is no different. We go on this journey with Carl and the young boy scout Russell, Carl at first does not like Russell, nor does he want him around. These two characters are at opposite ends of each other, one old and quite, the other young and talkative. Of course by the end of the flick they bond. Also along for the ride are two side characters, Kevin the colourful native bird of Paradise Falls (they place Carl wants to finally see) and Dug, a dog who can mysteriously talk. Dug is not the only dog who can talk though, the place is full of them, all trained to open doors and fly planes. They all heel to their master Charles Muntz, who has spent his life trying to capture Kevin.Up is not only funny, fun and exciting, it packs a few emotional scenes too. Some people might want to bring some tissues, while it's not a sob story it is one of the few Pixar films that have moved me. What happens to Carl happens to everyone, so you can relate to him. You are immediately grabbed by him and his story and the film has more emotional punch in ten minutes of dialogue free montage then most dramas or romance films today can say for themselves.There are a lot of words to describe Up: Delightful, endearing and whimsical are a few, but one I will choose to employ is heart. Along with Wall-E, Up has the most heart out of every other Pixar film I've seen. The film has a PG rating though, only other Pixar film to have this is The Incredibles. The Russell kid is shot at and people die, at times I was thinking would kids be scared of this? I don't think so, nothing horrible ever happens that could traumatize a young one in my opinion.I did not bother to see this film in 3-D, I've heard it doesn't give enough 'pop' to warrant the additional money on the ticket. Seeing it at a regular theatre will not hinder your viewing at all. All the voice acting is top-notch and perfect casting with Plummer and Asner. See Up in theatres while you can, it is one of the year's best.",9,2,4,31 May 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," One of Dreamworks better efforts.
","Hiccup is a viking, the only problem is he doesn't seem to fit in with everyone else. He's scrawny, scared and can't kill a dragon when given the opportunity. Instead, he makes a unique friendship with the one dragon that people never seem to see. He learns that everything he knew about dragons was wrong and he must stop his father and the other vikings from killing more of them.How To Train Your Dragon seemed like another animated film that would come and go at the snap of a finger. Yet, it somehow managed to be the best review film of the year (so far) and rake in the cash. Word of mouth spread and along with the critical backing, the film has managed to stay in the top spot for awhile. So I decided to give it a chance. While the film is not as emotionally engaging as other animated films of recent years, it still manages to have fun and entertain.The voice acting from all was really well done. I had fun spotting who was who and each one gives their character that unique little bit of spice. Jay Baruchel has whiny brat down to a tee, almost to the point of annoyance. With the exception of America Ferrera, I was able to point out every voice actor, yes even the guy from Cloverfield. Her character, Astrid, who isn't in the book, is the love interest of our lead. She is the tough one who is jealous of Hiccup when he starts to get the spotlight for knowing how to handle the dragons. This relationship is never the focus point and seemed rushed, but I can live with it.The animation at times looks marvelous, the fur the vikings wear looks great. At other time it looks a bit weak, specifically the lead dragon. I don't know if it was the stylistic choice of making him look like a cat, but it looked like the weakest part of the animation to me. Which is funny, because the dragon was the best part of the film. Toothless, as he is called, was funny, cute and kick-ass. The scenes in which he is flying with Hiccup were really well done and added the sense of excitement and adventure the film needed.It has laughs here and there, but never did I find it overly funny. Instead it plays out the family friendly adventure spin. The story itself is nothing new, young outcast needs to win the hearts of those around him. Finds an unfamiliar friendship and uses it to his advantage. The setting of dragons and vikings was the new angle the film gave us. The relationship between Hiccup and toothless is a nice addition to a spew of films in which the lead character makes friends with an animal. While How To Train Your Dragon doesn't go leaps and bounds over anything else, it is one of the better films Dreamworks has managed to kick out recently. Both adults and kids will enjoy this film.",8,1,2,4 May 2010
Inside Man," 'Get Ready To Root For The Bad Guy'
","Detective Frazier, is one tough cop who is too smart for his job. Dalton Russell is a bank robber, who planned the perfect bank robbery. Hostages are at stake and Frazier needs to get them out. When an unexpected guest arrives, Madaline White, Frazier begins to believe that there is more to this heist then just the money.A Spike Lee Joint, one of his better joints if you ask me. Leaving his 'pro black, con white' message in his past, Lee has made an entertaining heist film that makes you side with the bad guy just because he is cool. Right from the get-go Owen tells you the What, Why, Where, When and eventually the How on the perfect bank robbery. Hearing this, you get the impression that he will be successful in this attempt. I'm not going to tell you whether he is or isn't, but throughout the entire movie, even though you might not want to, you can't help but cheer for Owen to get away with it in the end.While viewing the trailer, one gets the impression that Inside Man is more then just a normal heist flick and it is. It's difficult to go into an explanation of the plot without giving some bits of it away, as I've probably already have done for some. The plot of the film is interesting, although some may be expecting a bigger pay-off in the end, Inside Man does deliver the twists and turns, just not as big as some may suspect.Lee throws in his usual character has a racist moment as he does with virtually every film he does. He also manages to have fun with the time line and give us some testimonies of the survivors, it manages to flow well with the film. Here Lee is able to keep up with what's on the screen. He makes the plot follow along smoothly, up until the end though, where the film unexpectedly goes on and on dragging the viewer with it. It has to have that clich√©d ending where the detective realizes what has just happened.The performances are top-notch. Washington delivers us another great performance as the tough cop who seems to catch on to the scheme quicker then others. Jodie Foster gives a good performance with what little she has, even if her character has no background information what so ever as to what she does or who she is. She just happens to be there and with connections. Clive Owen is great as the bad guy, even if his face is covered for 3/4 of the film. He is so cool and sly as the villain that you end up rooting for him, knowing that it's the wrong thing to do. William Dafoe rounds out the supporting cast and along with Foster, doesn't have much screen time. This is forgivable because Washington and Owen are so good on the screen that you wish the story would stick with them.Inside Man begins as an action thriller and takes a quick turn to something a little bit more sophisticated, once we get inside the bank with our captives. The film itself will make you want to try and plan your own 'perfect robbery'. Lee gives us a great heist film that I'm sure will be mentioned with the best of them. If Inside Man was a bit shorter...such as cutting out some 'digging hole' scenes and a better wrap up, then it could have qualified for an early start to one of the year's best films. But for now it can just stay as being an entertaining heist flick....oh yeah, get ready to root for the bad guy.",8,3,4,24 March 2006
Pulp Fiction," One of the best films of ALL-TIME
","Pulp Fiction is a movie that grabs you by the throat and won't let go till the end. With it's great cast, incredible direction and unique ( at the time) dialouge, Tarantino has created a movie that will go down in film history as one of the best and will be remember for years to come.Pulp Fiction is 3 stories interconnecting. Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are two hit men on the hunt for a briefcase whose contents were stolen from their boss, Marsellus Wallace. Marsellus is out of town, and he's gotten Vincent to take care of his wife, Mia. That is, take her out for a night on the town. Butch Coolidge is a boxer who's been approached by Marsellus and been told to throw his latest fight. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are two lovebirds/thieves who have decided to rob the restaurant they're currently eating at. But the restaurant doesn't turn out to be as easy as the other places they've robbed.This is a film that has intense moments that will have you on the edge of your seat, case in point, the overdose scene where they need to inject a shot of adrenaline into Mia's heart. The close up tension from Tarantino and dialouge will have you on the edge of your seat no matter how many times you have seen it. What Pulp Fiction does so well is blend this with comedic scenes and basically 'nothing' scenes which make it more real then other films that we see.Tarantino manages to get great performances out of mediocre film stars like Travolta and Willis, who steal the show. But not without the supporting cast of so many great and talent actors, who fit their characters to perfection. Samuel L. Jackson is Jules, and no one else.What makes it more interesting is that the three stories connect and are told not in order, so multiple viewings are needed to understand the film as a whole, and with it's length, you would expect it to drag on in certain scenes, but with it's witty dialouge and the superb cast in those scenes you are nothing feeling like it's going on too long.Tarantino has pulled off a great film and I believe will never top it, this film is the best film of the 90's and one of the best films of all time.",10,1,4,16 August 2005
The Da Vinci Code," 'It's One Of Those Read The Book & Skip The Movie Types'
","The Da Vinci Code, based on the massively popular book by the same name, sees Robert Langdon sent to a murder scene to investigate certain symbols left by the victim. What Langdon figures out though, could destroy Christianity and his life.The Da Vinci Code is a cultural phenomenon, which almost everyone has read. So it's no surprise that they want to get a movie out there for the people who are too lazy to read the books, but here it's an obvious case of cashing in on the money that the book has earned. Much like Passion Of The Christ, you can tell that the filmmakers hope that it's controversy is the key to it's success. It's a shame to say that it's one of those read the book and skip the movie.I've read the book, been to it's locations and believe in Jesus Christ, so I really enjoyed the book. With Ron Howard giving us the motion picture, my hopes that the film making a good translation to screen were still up in the air. After finally seeing the film, I've come to realize that the book is indeed better then the movie. The main reason behind this would be because the film itself felt rushed. It felt like it was still trying to cash in on the book's success, it just so happens that it leaves the viewer wondering what all the fuss is about. If they haven't read the book that is.Da Vinci is the weakest film out of the Hanks and Howard collaboration. Hanks still doesn't seem to fit the title character of Langdon. No, it's not the hair, it's just that when I'm watching the film I see TOM HANKS, not Robert Langdon. Hanks aside, everyone else seems to fit their roles perfectly. I enjoyed Reno as the french police officer Fache and adored Tautou as Sophie Neveu. Ian McKellen does a good job as well, although I thought he was more comical then his character should be. Molina is barely used in the film, but out of everyone, it's Paul Bettany who shines here. Bettany showed his acting chops in Gangster No. 1, here he steals the screen. Unlike Hanks, Bettany becomes his character sends chills down some spines.The film is true to the book, but I could of sworn I remember a lot more stuff happening in the book then what was showed in the film. Granted, you can't transfer everything from page to screen, but it seems like they didn't really care for the material. The most important and entertaining part of the book seems to fly by here. I was also very turned off by the scenes that showed Langdon looking at certain things that weren't there. Hologram like images that play out in his mind and to the viewer, but are invisible to everyone else. The score was impressive, it's one of the few highlights in the film. The book itself was a page turner and never seemed to slow down, the film doesn't slow down either, but with a 2 1/2 hour running time it does hit you in your seats. National Treasure I said felt like a Da Vinci Code ripoff, but Treasure was the better film of the two. It was more adventurous then Code, which to me, even with it's beautiful locations, seemed confined. Howard is a good director, and if he actually took the time to make a good film here he could have had a success, unfortunately his rushed attempt to get the film in theatres shows. As does the acting, which is quite embarrassing at some points. The controversy surrounding the film should die down when people realize that the film isn't that great, as should it's box office intake. If they do decide to make Angels and Demons, I'll go to see it, as it was the better book and should make the better movie.",6,3,6,19 May 2006
The Happening," Great Ideas Don't Always Make Great Films...
","The Happening tells the tale of a phenomenon sweeping the country, in which people are killing themselves for no reason at all. At first people believe it to be a terrorist attack and they flee to the country side in hopes for safety. Unfortunately it's not terrorists, but something worse, something that cannot be explained, or escaped.Every time M. Night comes out with a new film, I get a little interested. Not full blown, I don't go opening night waiting to see a masterpiece, but I do respect the guy because he knows what he's doing. I think he's had the unfortunate task of being pegged as 'one of those film makers'. If you go see a Kevin Smith movie, you know you're in for dick and fart jokes, you go see a Tarantino film, you know you're getting into something violent. With M. Night, everyone expects a twist. When the film doesn't end with one, people groan, and if it does, it doesn't match his previous effort. It seems he can't get a break. Well, The Happening isn't going to help his case either.First problem is the script. While the idea is great and could potentially work, it has to many problems that throw the main interest aside. First, the characters, which coincidentally ties in with the acting. Mark Wahlberg I have no problems with usually. He always seems to have a soft spoken voice in every role, sometimes it works (Boogie Nights) sometimes it doesn't (The Big Hit). Here it goes totally wrong. He just doesn't come off as believable. Not once did he ever seem like he was really scared, not once did I ever take him for a teacher, and not once did I ever believe he was with Deschanel. These two characters never really engage the audience into their lives, I found myself not caring if they made it out alive or not. The random subplot with the guy calling her on the phone never flourishes into anything for the two, never causes and real drama or problems and ends up being a distraction and waste of time. The most interesting character in the film cuts his own wrists early in the movie.Second, the script never offers us any real scares. This ties in with the way M. Night directed this feature. Most of his films deal with tension, he builds it up and takes the audience on a ride. Here he misses the mark completely. The most 'tense' moment is laughable, the try to outrun the wind. There is no real threat here. Had this event made people kill others, then we would have some tension on our hands, but the entire premise if that people kill themselves. I think M. Night tried to scare his audience with the fact that they could not see the enemy, this is a failure.The film was marketed as M. Night's first R rated film. One gets the impression that it could be pretty gruesome. Yet it is held back. A lawnmower scene that should send shivers down peoples spines is ruined by fake CG blood spray. In that same shot a sign is the background that reads 'You Deserve It' and I can't help but get the feeling that M. Night was never trying to scare us in the first place, but teach us a life lesson. Be kind to plants? This shot was too on the nose to be a simple wink in that direction. Maybe this is why the film doesn't work, M. Night isn't trying to scare us at all, well congratulations for suckering an audience into seeing something that turned out to be something completely different. It's the village all over again.The Happening is an unfortunate mess. M. Night had some decent ideas and great shots (I still love the workers falling off the building shot) but nothing to tie everything together. The film suffers from a lazy script that can't bring the good ideas to the surface and mismatched casting. It's looks like M. Night is even now, 3/6 in terms of his films in quality. It's a shame that those 3 that aren't good are his latest ones. It's hard to tell is he will get out his this hole he has dug himself. If he will continue a career a become an actual film maker worthy of discussion years from now, or one of those one hit wonders who burned all their gas too quickly. If The Happening is a sign of where things are going....then there are dark times ahead.",3,0,4,25 June 2008
The Departed," Scorsese Is Back To His Old Form & Gives Us The Best Film Of 2006.
","Billy Costigan is an undercover cop who gets thrown into the hands of a notorious gangster, Frank Costello. Colin Sullivan is a member of Costello's gang who is a mole in the Boston police department. Once word gets out that there is a mole in the police department and a rat in Costello's gang, things begin to heat up as they try and smoke out the other.Infernal Affairs blew me away a couple years ago, then I heard that one of my favourite directors was doing a remake. I was a little hesitant at first, I didn't know if I was going to see old Scorsese (Goodfellas, Casino) or the recent Scorsese (Gangs Of New York, The Aviator). Granted the films under his belt as of late are not horrible, in fact they're great, they just don't have that old school touch that made Scorsese such a great director. With The Departed Scorsese is back to his old form and gives us the best film of 2006.The Departed is full of old school tricks from Scorsese. From an Iris Out and that classic Goodfellas feel, it makes for an intense thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat. With the crop of films this year not being all that great (save for a select few), The Departed blows them all out of the water. It's brutal with it's violence and doesn't hold back on anything.DiCaprio and Damon both shine in their roles, with DiCaprio having the more intense part and more screen time. I only favour DiCaprio a tad more because the scenes with Damon and Farmiga are a tad boring to watch. It was a joy to watch both of these characters slowly lose their minds being on both sides of the fence. Although they both shine in this film, they can't touch the great Nicholson. He is absolutely astonishing. He owns every scene he is in, even when he starts acting like a rat. He has this evil presence about him in this film, but he plays it with such a comedic tone, you can't hate the guy, but you can fear him. After seeing how great he is in this film I'm left wondering why Scorsese and Nicholson haven't worked together before now.Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and even Anthony Anderson all blend well together to bring the cast of The Departed full circle. Wahlberg stands out in this list, he is just as mean and foul mouthed as Nicholson and can actually hold his own with such a prominent actor as Sheen sitting right beside him. Alec Baldwin is a joy to watch as he spits out his comedic lines left right and centre and Martin Sheen brings the missing piece that fits the thrilling puzzle that is The Departed.There are numerous violent scenes that scream Goodfellas or Casino and it's nice to get that old feeling back. The film is gritty, brutal and violent and doesn't let you sit there and feel comfortable with any of it. People are getting shot left right and centre, beaten to death, hit numerous times with coat racks, beaten with shoes, stabbed, thrown out of buildings. The blood splashes all over the screen and with people getting shot in the face everywhere, you feel the uneasiness that Scorsese wanted. It's not as brutal as the one infamous baseball bat scene in Casino, but it ranks up there.The film does tend to drag on in certain areas, but that's expected. With it's fast story telling pace, Scorsese slows it down a bit so we can get to know more about who these two characters are. He keeps us on the edge of our seats wondering if their cover is going to be blown cause it can be blown at any point in time. Even after watching Infernal Affairs I was still tense, wondering what was going to happen next. That is the work of a great director.The Departed will get recognized by the Academy, but I doubt it will win anything. Scorsese is after 0/5 in that race. One can only hope though, cause he deserves it so much. This film, although definitely not his best (I don't think anything he does will surpass Goodfellas) packs one hell of a bloody punch. It has strong performances and a dark comedic tone that will have you laughing along with it. In the hands of any other director, it could have been a mess. Thank you Mr. Scorsese, for letting me have fun at the movies again.",9,1,5,8 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Bigger, Louder, But Not Better
","So the film goes like this. Sam decides to put on his old shirt from the first film, when he takes it out, a piece of the cube falls out. He picks it up and it imprints a bunch of alien text into his brain. Anyways, bad robots are after this information, good robots must protect him, people run in slow motion, Megan Fox looks hot, someone wants to destroy the sun, they require help from robots so old they use walking canes and then Boom. Something explodes. This is Transformers in a nutshell. The film is so confused on what it's intentions are that it has to literally have one character ask the plot of the film from another. This actually happens.A sequel to Transformers has to be bigger and louder, or else what would the point be right? Michael Bay seems to be an advocate of 'We Can Fix It In Post' or 'We'll Throw Some CGI At It'. This is never a good sign and this film is a prime example. For starters, the film is too long. It has unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the film. Seeing Sam's mother on drugs for comedic relief is not funny, it's rather eye rolling. This is screen time that could have been giving to develop a bit more of a story, or been axed all together and shave of 20 minutes of failed comedy.You simply cannot rely on Giant Robots Fighting as a draw for the audience. You need to give them substance, something this film lacks. For one, the main villain from the first one, good old Megatron, takes orders from some dude on a random planet. This guy is the 'Fallen' and he returns to earth to destroy the sun, blah, blah, blah he has very little screen time. We don't feel the threat. Speaking of very little screen time, let's look at the main stars of this piece. No, not LaBeouf or Fox, the Autobots. The main reason this movie will make money is because of them and they get shafted hard here. Aside from Prime and Bumblebee, every other Autobot is basically background filler. With one key scene in the beginning, then nothing else. Why alienate the fan base that warranted a sequel in the first place. Oh wait, I forgot, they do focus on some Transformers. They are called the twins, speak jive, can't read and one has a gold tooth.The entire film feels like Bay is just trying to out due himself. I can picture him on the set thinking how to make things seem bigger and more hectic, without giving a damn about the script. A script that is full of pages that read character jumps from explosion here, character runs from explosion there, character screams. But hey, what did I expect from a Bay flick right? Well, he did do The Rock and the first Transformers was really good. The final battle scene in that flick had more going for it, here I couldn't give a damn.Megan Fox, sure she is hot, but can she act? Not if we are going on this performance. Her orange skin was distracting in the first flick, this time it's her big Jolie lips. Labeouf? His role consists of the aforementioned running and screaming. I didn't know who was who, a problem from the first film. The robots, now I consider myself to have basic knowledge of the Transformers universe. but I couldn't tell what was what unless they were specifically mentioned, like Starscream or Soundwave. I finally figured if I see a robot, it has to be an evil one because that's all they seemed to be focusing on. Where was Barricade? The cop car that mysteriously disappears from the first film before the climactic battle. I thought they would bring him back here and mention that, but nothing. Instead we get a 5 second cameo from Scorponok, the one who tunnels underground, before he gets lights out. There is a new character, who basically plays the role Anthony Anderson played in the first one, a tech geek. His only purpose is to re-introduce Turturro.I wanted more from this film. We all know going into a Bay film we will get this, has he given up on giving us anything more? Has it been dumbed down to us guessing just how many explosions he will use in his films now? Too many, for this one. Giant robots fighting each other is cool, but we've seen it once. Is the only thing you're going to offer us is the same thing in a different setting? Change the city to a forest and some pyramids and it's all good? In defense of the flick, the special effects are top notch, they are epic. They look great up on the big screen and that's where you should see this flick, if you have any interest at all. The big screen and loud sound was made for this flick. The fight sequences are interesting, even if the last one drags on too long. The idea behind the this film is good, the whole history and origins of the Transformers, but instead of diving deeper into that, they wanted to blow stuff up.Too many characters (did we really need a robot chick who looked like she belonged in Terminator 3), too many robots (and the ones we actually care about are left for background filter), and an overblown and overly long film. This film could have been 20 minutes shorter. Transformers feels hollow inside. The first film had heart, this one is just dread. It will please the target audience of teenage boys who want to see things blow up or Megan Fox run in slow motion. But for everyone else, it's just another summer blockbuster that is louder then the original",5,6,15,28 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Lacks everything but Special Effects
","This is a movie where plot holes run wild....yes there are tons of them. But the ones that can't go unmentioned are the scene where the plane has crashed outside the wife's house, amid all this rubble, cruise's car is fine, and there's a neat little path right down the street through the destruction so they can drive away. Of course all the electronic crap.The special effects are spectacular. This of course is expected with this type of film, being a Spielberg/blockbuster film. Every turn in the movie there is a tripod alien destroying a part of the city. This is the highlight of this film because the plot lacks, the characterization lacks and the directing is below average for Spielberg.Anybody want to slap not only Tom's character in the face....but every other character??? Not one sympathetic human character in the entire film. Tom is an asshole, Dakota is crying all the time which made her extremely annoying, the son is a whiny bitch, Tim Robbins is an insane annoying useless character. Tim Robbins does nothing but distracts, he serves no point but to chew up screen time and make us think Tom will do anything for the life of his kid, but this comes across of jokey when they close the door and 'fight' Robbie should have died---it was a cheap move to have him show up in the end after saying he had to see the fight over the hill. Whenever this happens in the movie, it brings it down(Jurassic Park III.) Is it just me or does every Spielberg flick have to end in the happy we're okay ending in all of his movies.The pacing's terrible ¬ñ it just suddenly ends, bang, WAY TOO ABRUPT. The aliens catch colds and die. Film over. And most surprisingly in a Spielberg flick, there's no emotional clout here. There is no climax....that's because the whole movie is just destruction after destruction, if your into that kind of thing, then this movie is for you. But the best scene in this movie is not the destruction of the cities, but the basement scene involving the pointless character of Tim Robbins. Even though the scene is laughable at parts, it still holds up as suspenseful.The motivation of the aliens remain thoroughly obscure, at first, when they presumably want to rid the earth of mankind, They content themselves with firing death rays, like target practice, at individual fleeing humans, the most inefficient method of extermination imaginable. Then, midway through, suggest that, for no particular reason, the aliens are harvesting the humans to make those red vines things out of their blood.I felt cheated at the end of the film. The world was left in sh*t, everything was destroyed, covered in the blood vine things and we go to Boston where everything is fine...no houses destroyed, family all nice and neat and of course the happy Spielberg ending.",6,18,33,3 August 2005
Love Actually," Best Romantic Comedy Ever?
","This film surprised me. I did not know what to expect, I thought it was going to be another cookie cutter romantic comedy, only with a big cast. What I got is my favourite romantic comedy of all time. This film is touching, hilarious and extremely well made considering the amount of characters it had to juggle with.Everyone in the cast is wonderful, from Hugh Grant as the dancing Prime Minister to Liam Neeson's brooding widow father role. My favourite character was Bill Nighy. This was my first introduction to him and I loved every minute he was on screen. He was so funny and has been in every role since then. This was also my introduction to Keira Knightley, who doesn't really get that much to do but looks gorgeous. I final shout out to Martin Freeman as the porn stand in, too funny.This is a great film to watch to get in the mood for Christmas and ranks in my top 5 to watch during that season. Richard Curtis, in his directorial debut, handles numerous characters and story lines with ease. Not once did I think they were concentrating too much on one or not enough on another.In one of my favourite scenes, which is heartbreaking and a homage to Bob Dylan, Andrew Lincoln tells Knightley how he 'really' feels about her. This is all done through giant index cards and not a word is spoken between the two. Beautiful, funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.Give this film a go if you haven't already and since you'll be reading this during the Christmas season, it's the perfect time to throw it on.",8,1,3,20 July 2009
There Will Be Blood," Chilling, Haunting and Beautiful. There Will Be Blood - One Of The Year's Best
","Daniel Plainview strikes oil while mining for silver. Knowing the riches there are in this field he quickly changes his career and adopts a son after his father is killed in an oil rigging accident. Daniel's greed for power and money consume him and turns his loved ones into enemies and quickly becomes the target of a young pastor, Eli, to turn to God.Every time you hear that there is a performance so good it will win an Oscar, the first thing that comes to your mind is how boring is the film going to be? Monster, Ray and Capote all suffered this fate of not being able to keep up with the performance. With There Will Be Blood, P.T. Anderson gives us a stunning film that is as chilling as the performance from it's lead actor Daniel Day Lewis. If the film itself doesn't draw you into it's web, the performance from Daniel Day-Lewis without a doubt will. As it stands, it is impossible for him not to be recognized this year.For the first twenty minutes or so there is no dialogue. It's just Plainview working underground, he's dirty and broken, but manages to find a way to still get money. Later on he becomes an oil man and uses his 'son' as a cute image to get people to side with him. Lewis is remarkable here as you've all been told. He becomes to character, he is the character. While there have been amazing performances in the past few years, this one is without a doubt one for the books. Even if the film isn't remembered fifty years down the road, DDL's performance will be. Paul Dano is the supporting actor as the young pastor Eli, he also has a smaller role as Paul, Eli's twin. At times Dano is frustrating, his overacting is obvious for the character, who drives demons out of the residents, but there are times when his stone cold face is just too bare. Hearing him scream and whine like a little girl every now and then is a bit annoying as well.The cinematography is beautiful. Anderson knew exactly how he wanted this film to look like at he got his wish. The landscape is so beautiful, it becomes a character itself. It holds the oil or main character wants, the people who live on this land stand in his way. The film opens, much like No Country For Old Men, with views of the mountains and the land. Both films are beautiful to look at and watch.P.T. Anderson's previous films are pretty fancy. With There Will Be Blood you can clearly see his maturity as a director. This is not to say his other films are bad, on the contrary they are very good. But There Will Be Blood seems to be in another category all by itself. It doesn't belong with the others, it stands on it's own. If you were to watch Boogie Nights one day and Magnolia the next, you would be able to tel it was from the same director. Here he manges to hide his style within the film so well that it doesn't jump out at you like the others. He is more restrained with fancy camera movements and more concentrated at what the film is about. It's about this man and his greed for working.If the visuals are beautiful, then the music is chilling. Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead supplies the film with the score it needs to be the film it wants to be. Without it, it might not have had as much of an impact in some scenes. It's the music that drives these few scenes and it works perfectly. The thing that makes it work so well is that it's unusual and bizarre.There Will Be Blood is one of the years best films. It has one of the best actors giving us a powerful performance for the ages and a score that is chilling to the bone. There are bits and pieces of comedic fare, but most of the film is dark, much like the main character of Plainview. The final act of the film is heartbreaking and shocking. If you didn't like the ending to No Country For Old Men, you might not like this one that much either. While it is a more finished ending, it does kind of just happen. But it goes out with a bang and yes the film does live up to its title.",9,2,7,2 February 2008
Edge of Tomorrow," Most underrated film of 2014
","The storming the beach sequences were spectacularly filmed. I never lost track of where I was within the action. Too many films these days try to hide their shortcomings by having the immersive camera, which basically means shaky cam. This does not enhance the viewers experience in 'war', it does the opposite. You'll have your audience squinting at the screen trying to see what the hell is going on. Liman manages to film the battle sequences beautifully, blending action, comedy and drama in all those sequences. Wait, what? Comedy? Yes, this film is funny. Liman has fun with killing off Cruise multiple times in funny and unique ways. Cruise is a coward when we meet him, trying his hardest to NOT be enlisted onto the front lines. But things don't work out for him and he finds himself waking up in cuffs and thrown into the war. No idea how to use his mech suit, no idea how to fight, no idea how to do anything, he finds himself in hellfire trying to stay alive. He doesn't last that long and ends up dying after blowing up an 'Alpha' alien. Rewind. He wakes up again back in cuffs, alive. But how? What can he do differently to survive this time? Edge of Tomorrow takes a few minutes to explain to the audience why Cruise has this ability and what he must do to stop it, but other than that, this film is non-stop excitement. The editing here is crisp and benefits the story immensely. We are in Cruise's shoes at the beginning, learning what is going on, seeing the different outcomes for the first time and how it can be changed. Then, we find ourselves in Emily Blunt's shoes, experiencing events for the first time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it hasn't happened already. Cruise reveals that he's been here before, despite the viewer never seeing this scene. Now we have no idea how many times he's gone back. The third act raises the stakes a bit, I won't reveal why, but at that point it also tends to be a bit more generic and clich√©d. Other than Blunt and Cruise, we aren't really given much character development from others. Not needed really, but how are we suppose to care for the squad Cruise is with when they die? We don't. I found myself asking questions after the film was over. Does every time Cruise die start a parallel universe ala Back to the Future? There was one particular sequence where he dies and it continues on for a little bit. We see what happens after he dies, so the question remains, does each time he die have that exact timeline continue on? OR is it simply that ONE timeline that continues to be reversed. Either way is possible.I highly recommend seeing this film. I went in with low expectations and was more than surprised.",8,1,4,2 January 2015
Army of Darkness," Now Listen Up,You Primitive Screwheads...You Must Watch This Movie!!!
","In the third installment of the Evil Dead Trilogy, our hero Ash is sent back in time to 1300 A.D. where he is enslaved and sent to the pit. After defeating the evil deadite that lingers in the depths of the pit, he is hailed as the chosen one. Ash, wants nothing to do with them and only wants to get back home, but the only way to do his is to retrieve the book of the dead. Unfortunately for Ash, he awakens the dead while taking the book, and now must battle the army of Darkness before he goes back to his own time.Back in the year 1981, Sam Raimi and a group of friends created one of the most terrifying horror movies to date, The Evil Dead. Again in 1987 Raimi and Co. managed to create yet another genuine horror experience with Evil Dead II. Now with the third installment in this series, Raimi gives us a comedic cult classic film that will have you quoting every piece of dialogue in your every day life.Army of Darkness is a perfect example of a cult classic. If you go walking down a street and ask if anyone has heard of it, they'll give you the crazy look. But search the net or go to any horror convention and you'll see that there are Evil Dead maniacs out there, and I am proud to say that I am one of them.Most trilogies tend to suck by the third film, Blade trinity and revolutions to name a few, but here Darkness manages to make itself a stand alone film and a fine damn one at that. It still has it's nods to the original Evil Dead, but if you're looking for the ultimate horror experience, then this film is not for you. Instead Darkness is full of comedic dialogue and actions. Our hero ASH spits out classic one-liners that so many people try to copy today...I'm looking your way Duke Nukem.Bruce Campbell is ASH. His character evolves throughout the trilogy and it's in this third installment that he is a badass. It's in this third installment that everyone remembers him from. It's in this third installment where he has the chainsaw, the boomstick, the one-liners, the sugar. Campbell will always be known for this one character. He's such a coward and yet we still feel the need to cheer him on. Campbell is the master of physical comedy and he uses it to his advantage here, fighting an army of mini ashs, splitting away from his evil self and getting his face sucked down an unknown demon hole from a book.Speaking of which, that's what makes the film even more enjoyable. It's insane bizarre comedic tone. Whether you like slapstick comedy or have a dark funny bone, this film is delightful for all. I never thought I would laugh so much at someone pouring boiling hot water down their throat. Then to have the thing grow inside of you and try to detach itself from your body, only in a movie like this can you watch that and laugh with it. Granted, it would help if you've seen the first two films and in order as well. The opening does give you a recap of what's happened, but you feel more for the film and ASH if you've been through the horrors that he has.Much like Peter Jackson got his start in the horror movie genre, so did Sam Raimi. You know, the guy that went on to direct such big hits as Spiderman and Spiderman 2. Army of Darkness has the little Sam Raimi touch with it. Once you see it you can tell that it's Raimi behind the lens. Raimi has his brothers scattered throughout the film, playing many different characters at that. As well as Three Stoogies get ups and the POV of certain objects, such as arrows being shot or forks being thrown.The effects are great and still low key. You can tell which deadites are guys in suits and the black fabric behind the eyes of other skeletons, but that's what gives this film it's cheesy B movie goodness. Seeing ASH fight against all the evil mini ashs is a feat for the eyes as well, even if it does look so fake.This is a great way to end the trilogy. I hope they do not make a fourth installment, as this is one of the greatest trilogies of all time, I'd even put it in the same sentence with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, watch the Helm's Deep scene and tell me Jackson did not use army of Darkness as inspiration. I do not own all the DVD versions out there, which are a handful, but I do have the boomstick edition, so I'm able to enjoy the theatrical cut and the director's cut. Army of Darkness is a film that I can watch over and over and never get tired of, which is what a great fun movie should be.",10,11,13,18 May 2006
The Wrestler," You Will Cheer For The Wrestler
","An aging and broken down wrestler tries to live a normal life outside the ring, but when things get even worse in his life, he turns to the one thing that kept him going and made him feel loved, wrestling.Mickey Rourke's performance as Randy 'The Ram' Robinson is honest, heart-breaking and real. Probably the most real performances I've seen this year and one of my personal favourites. True, the story of this character mirrors the life of the actor himself and it's obvious that he brought that with him, but it's hard to watch this film and not cheer for him, feel sorry for him and want everything to work out in the end for him.This is the 4th film from Darren Aronofsky and it goes back to his more independent roots, like his first feature Pi. Not saying his other two features who big Hollywood productions, but anyway. The Wrestler is shot in a gritty, low budget documentary style that suits the film to a tee. This isn't high production value WWE wrestler. This is the independent, small ring, small crowds, real pain wrestling and the way they shot it reflects just that. This character study wouldn't have had the same impact if it looked clean and pristine. It would have felt fake.The two, often misjudged, professions in this film are wrestling and stripping. People often throw wrestling aside claiming it to be fake. The film makes to effort to take one side or the other, it just tells it like it is. Yes, these guys know how it is going to go down and who is going to win, they have the moves mapped out before the match begins, but it's really their bodies being thrown to the floor, it's really their heads being smashed with a chair. As we see in the movie, the blood is sometimes self-inflicted, for the show and entertainment. Yet, it is still their blood that is being drawn.The second is stripping, which is where Marisa Tomei enters the film. The one character who Randy is able to have a relationship with, even if it is a short lived lap dance and he has to pay for it. Here is a guy that can't pay to keep his trailer open for him, but is willing to spend 60 bucks on a lap dance. Is it because he is horny, or he is in need for some kind of human contact, somebody to talk to. Well, it turns out he actually likes the broad, but guess what, she doesn't date customers. Ouch, another hit in the face for Randy in the real world.After Randy has a heart attack he is told he can't wrestle and Cassidy/Pam (stage name and real name) tells him to go see his daughter. The only problem is they haven't spoken in years. He hasn't been a father to her, he doesn't know what music she likes, what type of person she is, or even her birth date. He tries his best to re-connect with her and pours his heart out. I wanted this relationship to work more then the one with the stripper, this one felt more real. I can't say too much about Evan Rachel Wood, she plays the clich√©d teen angst daughter. We've seen her do this before with the film Thirteen. As good as Rourke is in the film, there was not one scene that particularly jumped out at me as amazing. I was waiting for a scene in which he would knock me out of my seat, yet that never happened. It could be because he's really good throughout the entire thing and that the entire film is his one scene that will knock you out. The film is not to be outdone by Rourke's performance either. I was never bored, and always connected.The soundtrack ain't to shabby either.",8,2,3,25 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Great film, with disappointments
","We start off with your typical STAR WARS, but go down to a non-typical fight. TIE fighters everywhere, beautiful special effects, but from the ongoing camera movements and the bright colors on the screen, it got a little disorienting. The reason for this? Well the clone war is ending and a new villain has entered the series known as General Grevious, half alien half machine with four arms, who from what I've read all over the internet was suppose to be a Jedi killing mother, which brings me to disappointment number one. General Grevious. This thing does not kill one Jedi in this entire movie. In the scene were OBI-WAN enters and Grevious tells the others to back off, he takes out his four light sabers ready to own. I get excited expecting to see the 2nd best light-saber battle in the whole series. Yet, what we get is a short 2 minute if that fight. First of all, no way can Kenobi block all the light sabers from this guy with his one, yet he does and he manages to slice off two of Grevous's sabers, then the little guy runs away, his end comes by a gun, shot by obi-wan, what a waste of my time, that was pathetic.You expect to see this guy kick major ass and he's taken out of the picture so easily, which is one of my problems with the whole prequel series (Darth Maul/Jango Fett) This movie of course is darker then the first two and probably darker then Empire Strikes Back, it also carries the most light-saber battles/action scenes in the entire series.....but after seeing so many light sabers battles they kind of lose their excitement. YODA VS EMPEROR....while great, kinda let down by the shortness and how they did not use their 'arena' to the full potential. ANAKIN VS OBI-WAN, people have been waiting for 20 years for this battle and it finally comes, it was good, you can even say epic in a way. But worth the wait of 20 years......I think not. Mace Windu and random Jedi VS EMPEROR....boy did those JEDI get it in 3 seconds or what, it looked like he was literally slow as a snail going uphill when he stuck the light-saber in them and yet the still take the hit. MACE Windu owned the emperor in the battle and the glass shatter was a great. The best light-saber battle is still DUEL OF FATES Excited to see old characters such as Chewie and VADER, even though you know for a fact that they will have little screen time you can't help but feel disappointed with what they do in that screen time. Vader has no more then 5 minutes on the screen and the Frankenstein tribute was totally stupid in my opinion and took away from the awesomeness of VADER. LACK of Chewie.....lack of Wookies in general. The battle between the Wookies is very short.What are the absolute worse things about this movie, well you probably would have guessed it, since it does not improve what so ever over the other two...dialogue and acting. A lot of the times I found myself rolling my eyes at the utter stupidness of some of the lines. 'You're so beautiful..' 'Only because I'm so in love.' 'No, it's because I'm so in love with you.' HAYDEN is still bad as Anakin until the transformation takes place. Ewan is probably the worst one here.'hang on were smarter than this' That is said after being trapped in an energy shield and of course the unbelievable scene where he sees his PADWAN a person who he calls his brother and person he loves kill the young lings (another gripe....just call them children) and all he can say in a monotone voice is something along the lines of 'I can't watch this' Please it looked/sounded like he was just reading it from the script. Not all the acting and dialogue is bad in this film, the highlight of the movie is PALPATINE....like Ebert said in his review, he has the hardest job of playing a character on both sides and he pulls this off marvelously. He owned this movie, even more then YODA....who owned the second. Yes this is the better of the first two prequels for the fact that we get more into seeing why things are the way they are....Luke/Leia, Emperor and his disfigurement, that's about it, yup they don't really tie the two films together very well in my opinion. I was just waiting for more things to pop up to tie them together. There are still plot holes. Which I do not want to read the books to find the answers to, this should have been addressed in the film. 1> Who is Cyphis Deus? 2> How does Leia remember her birth motherWe all know what happens in this film and everyone is only going to watch it to see how these things come to be, but I was hoping/praying for one thing to be a surprise, one little thing. I remember reading somewhere that a line is spoken that shatters the STAR WARS universe, where is this line? We all know the Anakin becomes VADER and I was impressed with the story behind why he did this, but not with the amount of time it took for him to do this....it was so quick, I understand the time frame but come on, the movie went by so fast you could of put more time for the transition. The movie is 2:30, but with all the action it flies by so fast. When ANAKIN VS OBI-WAN came up I was thinking to myself, already? I didn't like how he chose the dark side to save Padme's life, but tries to kill her at the same time.",8,3,6,21 May 2005
Inception," Nolan outdoes himself with another multi-layered masterpiece.
","In trying not to give too many plot details away, I'll sum up the story of Inception with this. A team of people use a device to go into another person's dream. While there they can do things such as extract information, or even plant ideas. That's about as far as I will go; it's the basic plot of the film that most people already know. Much like District 9 and Avatar (at least for me) the less you know about the film, the better.Christopher Nolan, with Inception, has created a masterpiece. It's hard for me to heap such praise on the guy who has a small film resume under his name, but he has, in my opinion, 3 films that will never be forgotten. Memento, The Dark Knight and now Inception are all films that I hold in high regard. It's funny, right after The Dark Knight, I heard Nolan was planning on making Inception, instead of a third Batman film, I was a little ticked off. I wanted another Batman film, not some side project. It's ironic that I enjoyed Inception more than The Dark Knight. Inception is a multi-layered film that has so much going on that it might seem intimidating. Yet, you never lose sense of where you are. Nolan is able to pull off this feat remarkably. People go into multiple dreams and different levels and the viewer never loses a sense of where. Nolan shows nothing but confidence and creativity in this film. It's not afraid to challenge you a little bit. I'm not saying it dives into deep philosophical issues here, but it is enough juice to get people thinking. Inception had me giddy and smiling all the way through. It's very hard for a film to do that. There was one scene in particular, where I was not only in amazement in how utterly and ridiculously awesome it was, but how simple it was to achieve. The scene is the hallway fight sequence in which gravity no loner seems to be an issue. The simplest form is used, moving and twisting the set, and Nolan makes it look ten times better than anything else we've seen in recent years. Nolan creates films that people really need to wrap their heads around. He is the next big thing. Hell, he is the big thing. He is the hottest director right now that has yet misstep. Nolan and his brother have created an original piece of art here, a crime caper if you will, that involves going into the subconscious. The creativity is off limits, as seen by the section of the city overlapping itself. I loved how they have taken things that you feel and think about while dreaming and incorporated it in to the film. In order to wake up you need a kick, that feeling that you're falling. I've felt it and I love that they have incorporated things like that. There is a lot to talk about with Inception, even the ending, which in my mind was Nolan having a little bit of fun. Obviously that question would pop up sometime in the film, but Nolan knows not to go that route. I think it's there simply to get people talking while he laughs at his own little joke. In any event, I'll through my two cents in by simply saying I'm an optimist. I hear that people aren't that big a fan of Ellen Page. I think she did fine holding her own against DiCaprio, who shines yet again much like his tortured role in Shutter Island. My one complaint about her is that she was a bit intrusive of characters and their dreams. The film feels a little bit like a Batman reunion. Michael Cain has a small role, but Cillian Murphy and Ken Watanabe both have integral parts to the story. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who I couldn't stand on 3rd Rock From The Sun, is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Marion Cotillard has an interesting role and her performance, other than DiCaprio, has the most emotional depth to it. Every single addition to the cast is a perfect mold for this world. I really loved this film, for it's running time, it never drags. It's always interesting and engaging the viewer. It doesn't slow down to explain things, and doesn't really need to. It might seem confusing at first, but like Ellen Page's character, the viewer is a quick learner. Inception is the best film of this year and another achievement that Nolan can be extremely proud of. I like that it's an original idea and it seems to be doing well, we need more films like Inception.",10,3,8,20 July 2010
Lord of War," Cage's Performance Makes A Dirt Bag Character Actually Likable.
","Yuri looking for a way to find fortune beyond his dreams, decides to turn to arms dealing. Supplying arms to every army except the salvation army. It turns out that he has a natural talent for the gig and brings his brother in for the business. Although when Interpol agent Valentine starts to shake things up, Yuri finds himself slowly losing his mind. Will this dangerous business ruin his relation with wife and son, what will it cost him to stop?Andrew Niccol hasn't had a really good successful film as of yet, both Gattaca and S1mone had lackluster box office. Here Niccol has the support of Cage, who has a long list of films as of late. As well as a controversial topic, perfect for these times that we live in. Niccol does score with his biggest opening for a film and great reviews, yet the box office seemed to fade away. Well, with no US distributor funding money for this project, who could really guess why?Lord of War opens with the production a bullet, going through every single stage until it reaches it's target, which is a young African boy. This is the best opening for a film the whole year. It's quite unique and ultra cool. If you went into this film expecting action left right and centre, then this will be a huge let down for you, because Niccol's films are about characters, and Lord of War is one of the best character driven movies in some time.The main character is Yuri and Nic Cage hands in a great performance by making a dirt bag character actually likable. He gives the character a certain charm, as he does with every role. Leto is Cage's brother, who is a drug addict, going to re-hab to get his life straight. Leto does a decent job and in the last scene showcases the highlight of his talent. Then we have Hawke, who is surprisingly not in the movie that much. War is more about Cage's character and his life as a dealer through the decades, then it is about Hawke tracking him down. Hawke gives a good performance with what little he has.If you are interested in the topic, then Lord of War is a great film. It will give you insight of what the world of arms dealing is and how it affects everyone. With every character driven movie, there are bound to be some parts that will drag on, and Lord of War is no exception. I found that when Cage is stranded in Africa and starts to really lose his mind, it was kind of dull.Lord of War is really a film that you either love or hate. This is Niccol's best film as of date, with Gattaca right behind it. Ian Holm, Bridget Moynahan have small roles that play an outcome of Cage's character. But it's the ending of this film that will have the biggest effect on you. Love it or hate it, Lord of War has something to say and in these times it's best to listen to it.",8,0,2,10 January 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Holmes Is Actually Quite Good.
","Sherlock Holmes makes it to the big screen with the help of Guy Ritchie with his first real Hollywood film. Robert Downey Jr. is the titled character, this time playing up more of the bad boy attitude. This role is similar to the recent Iron Man films, as both Holmes and Stark are egotistical geniuses with a substance abuse problem. Does life imitate art?Robert Downey Jr brings that same quick wit and attitude that we loved him for in Iron Man to Holmes and he plays of really well with Jude Law. The two have better chemistry than the supposed romantic relationship. The bromance between the two is one of the highlights in the film. Law, as Watson, brings his comedic skills to light as he tries to be the level headed one of the group. Rachel McAdams is the Irene Adler, the only person to get the best of Holmes. She is likable, as always and even though the relationship doesn't match what the boys have, it's still good enough to get a pass by me. The film is more action oriented than what one would think a Sherlock Holmes film would be. But to my surprise, Holmes in the books did know martial arts. So in a weird way, it fits. I don't know how I feel about the slow motion sequences, but that's just a few technical nit picks here and there that don't really affect the overall story of the film. Blackwood, the villain, played by the guy who seems to love the evil roles, Mark Strong. He uses black magic to try and get what he wants, something that Holmes doesn't believe in and this truly tests his theories and beliefs. Blackwood is caught at the beginning of the film and sentence to hang, but mysteriously rises from the grave days later. He is out to kill again and Holmes must stop him. It's popcorn entertainment and exactly the type of performance one would expect from Robert Downey Jr. Ritchie handles the Hollywood budget well and gives us one of his better films as of late. I'm just happy he's not trying to recapture the Lock Stock and Snatch glory days anymore.",7,1,1,21 September 2010
WALL¬∑E," Pixar Has Yet Another Incredible Film Under Their Belt.
","WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to compact garbage into little squares after humans have left because the planet can no longer sustain life. 700 years of doing what he's been programmed to do and his only companion is a little cockroach. One day a giant space ship lands on earth and sends out a robot named E.V.E who must complete a classified mission.As soon as I saw the teaser for WALL-E I knew it was going to be something special. What I did not know is that it is one of the most original and entertaining films I have ever seen. Pixar has an incredible list of films under their belt and is the leading studio in animation, WALL-E have a spot at the top of that list and has set the bar for future animated films.Why does WALL-E stand out from the rest of the animated films that have come before it? Is it the incredible detail in the animation? The lack of dialogue for it's main characters? The epic adventure? The story or morals? Wel, it is all that and more. The first half of the film has WALL-E doing his daily routine of garbage compacting. Without a single word spoken we know everything we need to know about this character. The old saying of 'show, don't tell' is used here and perfectly I might add. Through the endless fields of garbaged packed to level the skyscrapers we know that WALL-E has been here for hundreds of years and that the world is nothing but a baron desert. We know that we as humans did this to ourselves. We are given a quick back story through futuristic billboards that activate on motion when WALL-E passes them. WALL-E collects items from the trash that he finds interesting, everything from an iPod to a Rubik's cube. He examines them and tries to learn them, as if an alien from another planet were to come to earth and try to learn about our species. E.V.E arrives and WALL-E instantly falls in love with her, trying to win her affection at every turn and she turns him down every time because it's not her directive.This first half of the film has the most realistic looking creations I've seen in animation. Every close-up of WALL-E (specifically when he plays his radio device) looks amazingly realistic. Almost as if this is occurring in our world, it's not until we get to the second act that we begin to see more vibrant and animated aspects of the film. After WALL-E offers E.V.E a plant he found, she scans it and takes it. The ship she arrived on comes back, we begin to put thing together and WALL-E hitches a ride into space, a place he only dreams of. The mother ship is where all the humans are, they are fatter now because they are waited on hand and foot by robots, they are driven around on hover chairs and are constantly talking to another on a futuristic video phone, so much that they don't even realize the place around them. They don't even need to get out of the chairs to change their clothes, one press of a button and you go from a red suit to a blue one.The film throws back to the days of silent films and the lead character , WALL-E manges to show more emotion in a single look then some of the finest actors today do in whole films. The introduction of humans is when 90% of the dialogue kicks in and the plot is kicked into motion. I won't give it away because it is an important part of the story. The appeal of WALL-E is universal, everyone can connect to him through his actions. He is a cute, lovable and ultra-cool robot.WALL-E has been roaming Earth for so long that he takes the parts of other WALL-E robots so he can sustain his directives. He's rusted and falling apart everywhere, yet has a big heart. E.V.E is sleek and beautiful, yet dangerous. She can destroy you in a blink of an eye. These two robots are obviously from different worlds, have different directives, yet share a connection. What most animated lack WALL-E has. Most animated films as of late (Save for PIXAR) aren't adventurous enough. Kung-Fu Panada stays within the village. Even the Shrek films seem to be lacking in adventure. Both of those films created worlds that could go on forever, yet they never explore them. WALL-E seems bigger then it actually is and it's ten times more entertaining. It's one an only fault is that t becomes too preachy. It has a message and it gets it across, but it seems to beat you over the head with it. It's forgivable since the film flies through it's running time and has a grand epic scope of adventure that kids will love and adults will cheer. This is the first time I actually loved an animated film. Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille are all great films, but I never had a strong connection to them as much as WALL-E. WALL-E is one of the best animated films of all time.",9,2,5,3 July 2008
Centurion," Fight or Die.
","A small group of Roman soldiers are left alive after an attack on their legion. They must survive the elements and an expert tracker coming after them. Behind enemy lines and fighting for the lives. With Centurion, Neil Marshall has his biggest budget to date. The film is ambitious in style and tone. Marshall, who get a cult following after two excellent small horror films (Dog Soldiers and Descent) has gone on to bigger, but not really better things. Doomsday was a nice throwback to genre films (even though it didn't really know which one it wanted to be) and now Centurion, which has Marshall tipping his hat to Gladiator and Spartacus. I consider myself a Marshall fan, which is why I even bothered to give this film a viewing. If his name weren't attached, I wouldn't have bothered. Marshall is apart of the Splat-Pack. The horror coined group for filmmakers like Rob Zombie and Eli Roth. It's no question as to why Marshall is apart of this group, every film of his has some body part ending up some place. It's funny to me that this film might be his most gruesome one yet and it isn't even horror.The film's most gruesome moments are during the big attack on the romans. Arrows are shot into heads, arms, legs and necks are taken out like a hot knife through butter. I had a few moments where I was actually shocked at the carnage on the screen. One of the more gruesome period pieces. During the attack, the Picts (Scottish) take prisoner the General (Dominic West). The small group of survivors, including Michael Fassbender decide to try and get him back. They fail, but they did succeed in killing the lead Pict's son. He sends a group of people to go after them, thus we have a cat and mouse chase throughout the film.It's suspenseful in places and aggravating in others. The lead tracker, is suppose to have excellent skills, where she is always on their tail, no matter what. Yet the filmmakers seem to forget this sometimes. She can sense them across the river in one scene, but not underneath her feet in another. These inconsistencies are bothersome. Yet it happens. The characters themselves aren't too memorable either. I couldn't really tell the survivors apart from one another and neither stood out of the crowd. These shortcomings in the script are what bring Centurion down. The most interesting character is killed off too early too.Yet, Marshall still manages to deliver an entertaining film. It's not near the level of awesome that is Dog Soldiers, or even The Descent, but it does deliver what you would expect from this genre. There are moments where the film loses its sense of direction (such as a lover subplot) and there are even moments of predictability, but as a whole, the film delivers.",7,26,40,13 December 2010
Halloween," The One That Started It All.
","So here is a film that defined and ignited a genre. It wasn't the first, but it was one of the first and one to start so many imitators that never really got the formula down right. Carpenter is a master at his craft and he doesn't always score, but I applaud him for what he does and I can say that I enjoy most of his work. Halloween is one of his finest.So what is scarier then William Shatner? How about William Shatner spray painted white. Honestly, I find this mask scarier and more menacing then any hockey mask or fencing mask (ha, I hate Urban Legends 2). They ruined it in the sequels, then got it right again with Zombie's vision, but here it was the first and best. I was surprised that his mask came off in the film and we saw his face underneath. I grew up in the 90's, so I always saw the masked killer, then have the reveal at the end. Never did I see the victim tear the mask off during a scuffle, I was taken back....and I liked it. That scene makes it seem more real. Well done.I guess since I grew up with the horror films being more in your face and graphic with the killings, I wasn't too impressed with the deaths in this film. Everything felt kind of slow to me, like the actors were taking it easy with each other in those scenes. Small nitpicks I have.With other killers, they all have their reasons. Krueger is getting revenge on the kids of the parents who killed him, Jason is getting revenge on the kids who let him drown and killed his mother, the killers in scream are all about revenge. Then we have Michael Myers, who is described as PURE EVIL, from the one man who probably knows him best, Loomis. Not Loomis from Scream, that was a homage for you young kids out there.Donald Pleasence's most notable role? Some would say so and I would agree. Also Jamie Lee Curtis pops up here and she is quite good. I never really cared for much of her stuff, but I took notice here, even if it was one of her first gigs. Although, yes, her screaming at the end in the closet can get on the nerves.Halloween is the horror film to watch on Halloween. It's almost a rule, ritual, given. I can't say much for the sequels, but the first is always the best.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the cover? Simple, yet badass.",8,1,3,20 July 2009
1408," 'The Shining For 2007'
","Mike Enslin makes a living as an author, who specializes in the paranormal phenomenon. After receiving a postcard saying DO NOT STAY IN 1408, Mike becomes intrigued. After much hassle and waring from the hotel Manager, Mike finally makes it into the room. What at first seems to be a normal hotel room, turns into a horrific nightmare and Mike only has one hour to live.There have been many films based on Kings writings. Some of these films are terrifying, such as IT and The Shinning; while others are terrifyingly bad, Dreamcatcher anyone? The latest film to be added to the list is 1408 and lucky for us it belongs to the former. 1408 works on many different levels and even throws a twist to the audience. While it's not the best King adaptation it certainly is one of the better ones and deserves to be called The Shining for 2007.In the era when so called horror films are full of SAWS and HOSTELS, it's refreshing to see some new blood being pumped into the genre. 1408 pumps a whack of blood and a whole lot more. The film starts off as one would expect, with Mike investigating one of his routine spooky places, then goes on to show his life as a writer with not so many fans. We get a sense of loneliness with Mike, he has lost something. Cusack plays the character well. For those who think they can't get pass the fact that it is John Cusack, I assure you you will not think about it during this film. His performance is a complete 180 from his previous work and I give him credit for pulling it off. Cusack goes through a wide range of emotions through this film, most of them being on the terrified side, but everyone of them is believable. Sure there are many other actors out there who could have pulled off this role, but Cusack does a fine job. Which is a really big thing that this film depends on, because there is virtually no one else in this film. The supporting characters are lucky is they get 10 minutes of screen time. Tony Shalhoub, of MONK fame is only in one scene and Mr. Jackson shares the screen with Cusack for just about ten minutes...to explain the horrors of the room, then he's gone.H√•fstr√∂m, whose work I'm not too familiar with does an excellent job of bringing King's short story to live with a vivid and creative imagination. He manages to keep the audience on the edge of their seat throughout the film the moment the terror starts. The film's intentions are not to scare you with the 'jump' tactic, but tries to pull something deeper, the kind of scare the builds and builds until you can't take it anymore. The entire time we are in this claustrophobic room and we know danger is looming, but we can't escape. We are stuck in this room because Mike is stuck in this room. We know the dangers ahead, we want out, he doesn't. The cinematography is beautiful, especially considering it takes place in one room. From the icy cold snow to the green walls and even the burnt aftermath of destruction, the film is beautiful no matter what is on the screen.Cusack talking into his recorder acts as his mind trying to grab any sense of reality in this evil room. Trying to debunk the true horrors of what is actually happening. Those true horrors are psychological. One minute something spooky is happening, then next everything is normal. This mind game has been done before and before and here it's brought to the next level. Everything that happens can instantly change. One minute you can be walking in the room full of snow, then next your trapped under water. Being confined to this one room with this one character places tension on the audience as well. We don't know what is going to happen next, but we know it's not good.There is somewhat of a twist in the film, I won't give it away, but once it happens you see 3 things happen and in this order. One is disappointment, the next is predictability and finally excitement that what you predicted is true. During this third part of things that happen, the scene in which everything is thrown back into focus is superbly done. Kudos to that scene as it is one of the best in the entire film. The main characters life he thought he had all of a sudden comes tumbling down, literally. This whole segment does slow down the pace of the film, but it fits perfectly into the psychological torment of this character.In the end 1408 is an excellent film that will send shivers down the spines of those wanting a good scare. If you're sick and tired of the played out genres of SAW or HOSTEL, 1408 is something new and exciting and actually good. You won't get much from anyone other then Cusack, but what he brings to the table is indeed a good performance. Every corner and every room within 1408 is something that you will have to see for yourself, you never know what horrors lie next and that my friend, is a good horror film.",8,188,267,22 June 2007
Raging Bull," I finally got to see this one.
","Jake La Motta, his violent temper wins him matches in the ring, but destroys his life outside of it. The film chronicles his life from rise to fame, to the destruction of it all. Martin Scorsese is my favourite director, so some of my friends considered it a sin for me to have not seen this one until now. Some people here would even say the same thing. The film is highly regarded as one of the best films of the 80's, some people will even go further and say one of the best films of all time. I, not so much. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I did not love Raging Bull. In fact, I was completely indifferent to it for the entire first half. The film finally managed to grab my interest for the latter part of his career/life. To me, the most interesting parts were after his boxing career, when he was a fat rude jerk. I can't fault Scorsese, because the film is expertly crafted from start to finish. The clever choice to shoot it in Black and White was a right one and the dedication that DeNiro put into the character is amazing. What Deniro did with the character and this role actors can only dream of today. Only one person I can think of today goes to the extreme lengths that DeNiro did for this role and that's Christian Bale. DeNiro really does shine in the film, while Pesci plays his usual self, this time a little less psycho. He's calm cool and collected and it's nice to see these two together in something fresh and new (for me anyway). Cathy Moriarty is beautiful and puts up with all the crap and physical abuse that is given to her by the abusive and womanizing LaMotta. I wanted to love it, and I think that's where the big trouble lies. The film didn't do much for me, like I said earlier it didn't really grab me until half way through, and by then I was really bored. Maybe the LaMotta story doesn't interest me enough to care. No where near my favourite Scorsese film, or even my Scorsese/DeNiro pairing. It's far from the worst though as well. Let the hate begin.",6,3,10,8 March 2011
The Wolverine," The Wolverine focuses more on character than spectacle.
","After the event of Last Stand, Logan has become a loner. He lives in the wilderness with his demons. Until a young woman enters his life with news that the man Logan once saved back in WWII when the US dropped the bomb on Nagaski, has asked to see him once more. He's dying and wants to offer Logan something no one ever thought could be true. His mortality. I still, to this day, wonder what this film would have been like had Aronofsky been behind the camera. Without a doubt it would have been a hard R rated spectacle with blood and violence. This Wolverine is the PG-13 version of what an R rated comic book film could be. It's violent, has harsh language and isn't set an wowing the audience, it instead has a story it wants to tell. Which is a step above what Wolverine had to go through with his origins tale and the atrocity that was Ratner's entry. The Wolverine sets itself apart from the other X-Men films by focusing mainly on the setting of this tale. Logan is now in Japan, something that the comic book readers will be familiar with as Japan plays a pretty big part of Logan's history. The change in local was a welcome addition as it gives the film a breath of fresh air about it. It stands out from the crowd, this is both a blessing and a curse. Why a curse? Well, I can't help but shake the feeling that this entry was ho-hum. I love that it tells a smaller story, a more focused story, but in the grand scheme of things is kind of feels pointless. It's like a side stop to sight see while we wait to continue on with bigger things. This film has a lot of issues, but nothing major that made me hate it. In fact, I liked it. This is probably one of the better entries in the series where Jackman has played this character a whopping 6 times. Here he looks leaner, meaner and more at ease with the character. Logan is haunted by his demons, mainly Jean Grey. Jackman plays the character with an emotional detachment, but also the need to belong. This character is a loner, he doesn't play well with others, but all he really wants is acceptance. Even if he says he doesn't. There are only three mutants in this film. Our titled hero, a one dimensional venomous vixen by the name of Viper and a redheaded martial arts expert who can see people's deaths in the future, Yukio. Rila Fukushima who plays Yukio, does well for herself against Jackman. She was impressive considering this is her first major role. Tao Okamoto plays Mariko, sister to Yukio and the target of the Yakuza. Logan takes it upon himself to protect her...maybe even fall for her in a forced there needs to be a love story kind of way. There are some twists in the film, that a child can see coming a mile away. Nothing too confusing in the plot that features assassination attempts, kidnapping, betrayal, family issues, etc. The most interesting aspect of this film is the fact that Logan has his healing power taken away from him. Now we have a guy who was once immortal (or close to) getting tired from simply chopping some wood. His healing powers are significantly slower, he bleeds, needs to see doctors and finally feels the pain. This raises the stakes for a once unstoppable character. One issues I had right away was that even with his healing powers gone, he shows no signs of pain or slowing down with his metallic claws rip through his hands. No sign of damage there. Big oversight from the filmmakers on that one. The Wolverine is an interesting character study. It has one showy fight sequence on a train, that walks the line of cartoonish. It's more concerned with the fact that this guy is an animal, a loner who goes by his own rules being thrown into a society that has honour, rules and obedience at the forefront. He is out of his element and the audience is unaware they are too for the first time in this characters life. Shoddy storytelling near the end involving Logan's power makes the film end with me scratching my head. Throw onto that a ballsy move the filmmakers decide to do with Logan and you've got my interest in the next film.Does it reflect badly on the film that I thought the best part of it was the after the credit sequence?",7,1,4,5 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Legend Ends....On Nolan's Terms.
","This is a film that, no matter how good it was, would never live up to the hype surrounding it. It was going to be unfairly compared against TDK when it should be judged on its own merits. First of all, seeing this in IMAX was a marvellous decision and I hope others decide to too. The skyline shots are sweeping, the action sequences are mesmerizing and the detail, pristine. Next to Inception, this film is Nolan's most ambitious project. It's massive in scope and epic in its delivery. It's that epic feeling of the film that makes it stumble a bit while trying to achieve greatness. The Dark Knight Rises falls a step short in my mind. The story simply isn't as engaging this time around. I really like how they tie it to the first film, but I couldn't help but feel the story took second fiddle to all the action on the screen. This might be due to the larger than life plot here. Batman is dealing with nuclear devices now? The entire bomb inclusion felt like something that belonged in The Avengers. Which oddly enough, is what I felt like I was watching at times. Specifically with The Bat sequences and the way they deal with the bomb. I think I found the movie to be too big for its own good. The entire bomb plot device is really contrived and is something you would find in a dozen other blockbuster films. I'm really surprised to see it here, only because Nolan is such a calculating filmmaker. One would think he would want to sidestep such a generic and lazy plot device, but we are subjected to it nonetheless. With that aside, the entire sequence is still thrilling to see unravel and that speaks volumes to Nolan and his craft.I think one of my biggest issues is that there are dozens of small things that add nothing to the story and are really distracting. First and foremost is the limp we see Wayne have at the start of the film. I figured this would have played an integral part to the story and his fighting scenes, but he is given a leg brace that gives him super kicking abilities and it is never touched upon again. I expected his age, leg problems and later on, back problems, to play an integral part to the story, it never does. This becomes a distraction. Second would be Nolan attempting to have some deep themes and discussions in the film, but never going the step to continue them. For example Batman making his symbol on the bridge out of flames. We all know Wayne wants to be a symbol, indestructible, a legend to inspire people. This is illustrated in Batman Begins (and this film connects to that one a lot) so when he has his symbol go up in flames on the bridge to me that signified Batman trying to inspire the citizens of Gotham to rise up against their oppressors and reclaim their city. This ties in with the whole Occupy Wall Street movement Nolan has going on here. Yet this never happens, it's the police that rise up. Batman never wanted to inspire police, thus the whole symbol on the bridge becomes pointless since he is racing against time, literally, to save the city, or else.....boom. Add on to the list the useless character of Juno Temple and Batman himself having very little screen time, this film feels very lazy.Which tells me Nolan did the film as an obligation to the fans and not for himself. His heart simply wasn't in it this time around. Blake knowing that Wayne is Batman because he could tell from his face/history, was lazy, ridiculous and one of the most eye rolling scenes in this film. It felt more like a cartoon this time around than something grounded in reality like the previous films Nolan created. The twist in the film was meant to be this big moment, but anyone familiar with the Batman universe and its characters, know the relationship between them. So instead of being surprised, I was just waiting for him to reveal the twist that I knew was coming. The film leaves a lot of unanswered questions, has too many clich√©s (Catwoman coming back at the last second, how many times have we seen that done in a movie) and creative choices I wish he wouldn't have done (just show us Alfred smiling, no need to spoon feed the audience with the shot of them) The Dark Knight Rises would seem to have more problems than solutions.......but, even though this review seems like a negative one, the film is really good. I just felt obligated to get those negative aspects off my chest because Nolan is such a precise and talented filmmaker that I would feel like I was lying to myself if I let those aspects of the film slide. What it does good with, it does it in spades. The action is immersive, especially in imax, the acting is top notch and (aside from Ledger) the best in the series. The soundtrack, that some people hate, I liked. The look and feel of the film is epic and had me giddy. Nolan hasn't made a bad film yet. This is simply a great film, when it should have and could have been a 'masterpiece'. It is after all, the epic conclusion to his legacy. The Dark Knight Rises is the weakest written Batman film, but it does the series justice and it is a good send off. I'm a little conflicted on the ending because as Joker said in The Dark Knight, he and Batman are destined to do this forever. The history these two characters justify this quote, the way Nolan ends this film makes it not true, but he ended it on his own terms and I have to respect him for that.",8,1,4,28 July 2012
Iron Man," Iron Man Is Made Out Of Gold.
","Tony Stark is a wealthy weapons manufacturer on a routine trip back from a demonstration of his latest weapon, when he is attacked by rebels who want him to build his latest weapon for their own evil gain. Taking shrapnel to the chest, he must have a pacemaker like device on at all times in order to live. After escaping his captives, Stark sees a new side to life and wants to protect the people who have died from his weapons. Thus creating Iron Man.I've read a few issues of Iron Man, enough to know what the story is about, who the characters are and what to expect from the film. I never went in with high expectations, wanting it to be the best thing since sliced bread, and I left the theatre with a smile on my face. Iron Man is the firs real summer blockbuster movie to grace the screen in a long time. Filled with humorous dialogue, great casting and high flying special effects, Iron Man is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put to film.With the announcement of Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark, I knew John Favreau was the right man for the job. Downey has shined a light on himself so bright that I expect more leading roles to come his way. With perfect comedic timing and a dramatic arc to boot, he has created one of the most compelling comic book characters on film to date. With Peter Parker we are beaten over the head with his love for Mary Jane and his guilt for his uncle, we never really get pass this. X-men has too many characters to keep track of for us to emotionally connect to one central character. Iron Man manages to make a womanizing, alcoholic, weapons manufacturer actually likable. All of that is because of Downey's charisma. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much to do here, but she makes the material work. Howard was a little off his game. His presence wasn't there. It seemed like he wasn't confident enough in this role and it was really out of place. Jeff Bridges is menacing in the looks, but comedic in the dialogue. I don't know if it is my hours upon hours of Lebowski watching, but I just did not find Bridges voice to be menacing at all. I kept hearing the dude. He wasn't threatening enough.Iron Man sets itself apart from other comic book films (except for Batman Begins) with how serious it is. The film prides itself on being more realistic then what one would think. This is accomplished by focusing more on the man inside the armor then the high flying rocket shooting, breaking sound barrier hot rod red 'superhero'. This is because Iron Man is simply that....a man. He has no special powers, no enhanced ability. He has loads and loads of money.The problem with most origin stories is that it has to set everything up. It doesn't have the time to have fun with the story and make it seem really dangerous to the characters. Iron Man has a lot of set up and little delivery on the action. There are two scenes in which Stark throws on the suit and does actual battle. Not including the cave made promo device. This has pros and cons, it does make the film seem more plausible. I believed a lot of what was happening, until the final fight scene. Unfortunately, that final fight scene doesn't knock anyone's socks off. It doesn't blow our minds, it's too generic and the suit, environments and weaponry were not used to their full potential.The special effects are well done, nothing too jaw dropping. It seemed like the crew knew what they had to do and just went for that. Nothing seems to be trying to grab our attention, it all fits naturally. Some scenes are bit off and noticeable CGI is used, which may be distracting to the eye. Specially when Downey is sitting in front of the TV and he has the armor suits arm on his right arm.I'm impressed with Favreau. I wasn't a big fan of Elf and Zathura was garbage. With Iron Man Favreau has found his calling. I hope he doesn't try anymore kid films and sticks to what he knows and does best. He never let the content get away from him, considering it is so huge and upon first glance, would seem out of his league.Iron Man is a fun ride that kicks off the summer blockbuster trend. While it is not as good as X-Men 2 or some other comic book outings, it is indeed one of the strongest ones. With the inevitable sequel, we will get to see what Iron Man can really do.",8,3,7,6 May 2008
Casino Royale," 'The Only Bond Film In Which I Enjoy The Opening Credits'
","James Bond has just earned his '00' status and after a mission here and there, finds himself sitting at a high stakes poker table against the villain Le Chiffre. Bond joins the dangerous and sexy Vesper Lynd, who is funding his end of the game and he must come out on top.After seeing a little film called Layer Cake, I thought to myself, 'Wow, this guy would make a great Bond.' A few months later they actually announced the new James Bond and guess who got the gig, Daniel Craig. I thought that this was a terrific choice and that the fans would love it, but boy was I wrong. The only feedback I heard was negative, a blonde hair, blue eyed Bond? Could it be? People were so outraged they even created a 'craignotbond' web-site. Of course, all of this happened before the film opened and once it did everyone seemed to change their tune. Everywhere I went I heard that, not only was this the best Bond film ever, but the Craig was indeed one of the best Bonds. All I have to say is...I told ya so.I was never a big fan of the James Bond films. I've seen a few when they would appear on television and I grew up with Brosnan as my Bond. So out of the few Bond films that I have seen, I can say that this tops the list. I would go as far as saying it has sparked my interest in seeing the films because I know that this film decided to go in another direction. I'm thankful it did. Casino Royale is the first Bond film in which I actually enjoy the opening title credits. Usually I'll be sitting their bored out of my mind with the theme song playing, but here I was digging it.Is it more 'real' then previous installments? Well at first I would have said no, since that chase scene, as spectacular as it is, was off the wall in realism. The half man half monkey guy jumping everywhere wasn't too realistic to me, but I'll take that to an invisible car any day. Guess what, Bond makes mistakes too. His ego gets in the way of his goal and takes the audience along for the ride as well. Craig pulls off a convincing Bond, with an attitude unlike the rest of them. His charm and charisma shines throughout and I'm happy to say that my first choice was the right one. Let's hope we see Craig in more installments to the new franchise. With little in side jokes for true Bond fans, and blatant ones for people who just know his name, the film appeals to everyone. It's intense, thrilling and above all enjoyable.The beautiful and seductive Vesper Lynn is played dangerously and seductively by Eva Green. Playing well of Craig and adding a little bit of ego to herself can hold her own in the scenes. The villain, although not as over the top as almost every other villain is average here. What makes the Bond films so fun is seeing how insane these villains are. There is always that one thing about them that makes them crazy enough to be a Bond villain, here it was missing. Sure he has one eye and the other one cries blood, but what does that do for us? Nothing. As unrealistic as those villains may be, they were one of the main things that made those films so good, and taking that away isn't good for anybody.One little gripe about it though, would be that is slows done to a halt in the third act, which gave me the signal that it was wrapping up and everything was going to be alright. Then out of nowhere comes this scene with guns blazing and buildings collapsing. I thought the film was over, then it went on for another 30 or so minutes. Although, the last 5 minutes of the film are indeed that damn good.Bond is low on gadgets this time, and only one short car chase scene, which is fine considering it is his early career. Most of the tense scenes come from Bond sitting in a chair. He's playing poker of course, but sitting in a chair nonetheless. I enjoyed the action scenes and the films really tops the charts as one of the best Bond films and of the year. Much like Batman Begins and Superman Returns, we have a winner on our hands that is taking an old dying series and breathing new and exciting life into it. I'll be sure to see the next film, in which Craig can only better himself as the one they call Bond...James Bond.",8,1,3,30 December 2006
Toy Story 3," So The Third In A Series Can Be Good?
","Andy is going off to college and is given the option of putting his toys in the attic or throwing them out. Through a series of unfortunate events, the toys actually end up being donated to Sunnyside Daycare. Which at first, seems like a wonderful place to be, but the truth about the place is soon discovered by the toys and they try to escape.In 1995 when Toy Story first hit the screens, I was around 7 or 8 years old. I am in disbelief at how young I was, 1995 doesn't seem that long ago, but it's been 15 years. I was still in elementary school when the second one came out too. I was young and was able to connect to both of the films, I saw a little of myself in Andy. I grew up playing with plastic army men, dinosaurs and cowboys. There is a special bond between a boy and his toys and Toy Story got it perfect. The original Toy Story introduced us to a few things. One was Pixar, a studio that would go on to create dozens of films that are entertaining and brilliant. Another was the first fully computer animated feature film. It changed the way animated films were made. Finally it gave us two of the most recognizable animated characters of all time, Woody and Buzz. Flashforward 11 years after Toy Story 2. I have recently graduated college and don't play with my toys anymore. Andy is heading off to college and he doesn't play with his toys anymore. The big question I had was, can a third entry to a series that is more than a decade old, still hold true to the original and will I still be able to connect to it? The answer is yes, on both accounts. Toy Story 3 is magical, entertaining and heartfelt. It reminded me of my childhood and my toys, the biggest thing this film has going for it is nostalgia. I found it funny that more than half the people in the audience were not alive when the first film came out. The constant fear of being discarded is present here, as it is in all three of the films. With this entry it is the forefront issue. The themes of loss, friendship and courage are all present in this third installment. Usually the third film in a franchise falls short of what the first two are, but this is not the case. Toy Story 3 is just as good as the first two. My minor complaint is that there is that one thing that is missing. It might be the 11 year gap between the films, but there is that little special thing that made me love the first two films that this one doesn't seem to have. Buzz seems a little underused as do the other toys, but this is a small issue that doesn't ruin a great film.There are 3 scenes in the film that made me almost cry. Hey, I said ALMOST. The first one is pretty early on, when Woody calls for a meeting, something we are accustomed to in the previous installments. But this time we don't see dozens of toys coming out from under the bed, behind closets or out of bins. It's just these guys. All the other toys that we see in the background are gone. Even though they were never the main characters, or given a lot of screen time, there was something about each one that we seemed to love. This people were a family and that family is broken. Wheezy, Bo Peep, Etch, RC, Lenny the Binoculars, Mike the tape recorder, Rocky Gibraltar the gladiator. Dozens of lovable background characters that made us love that room so much more.The other two scenes are near the end, one in which the toys join hands in fear of their ultimate doom. It's their realization of the end and their bonding together that got to me. The other is the final send off from Andy. The film builds on the previous adventures these characters had to tug on the heart strings. It never reaches the emotional depths of Up, but these are two totally different films. The way they chose to end the series, in my opinion was perfect and sad. There are hundreds of new characters, all introduced at the Daycare. At first you would seem to think that you will be overwhelmed with all the additional characters, but it is never an issue. The two most prominent new characters are Lotso Hugs and Ken, who is voiced by Batman himself. Some of the more interesting new characters are never given a chance to shine, they belong to Bonnie in her room, mainly my new favourite Mr. Pricklepants. The film mixes adventure, comedy and drama all perfectly. It's not as funny as the first two, but it is more adventurous. The animation doesn't call for anything fancy, these are toys after all, yet Pixar finds a way to still dazzle the eye. The climax of the film has a lot going on and it is edge of your seat entertainment.To end this review, I'll simply say the last thing Andy said before leaving the toys...'Thanks Guys'",9,1,2,19 June 2010
Identity," Great cast in this predictable and yet surprising film.
","When a nasty storm hits a hotel, ten strangers are stranded within and as they begin to know each other, they discover they are being killed off one by one.This is a really dark film that succeeds in confusing you and gets you wondering whodunnit, I would have been disappointed if it had ended any other way. Identity is a stylish looking film, full of wet, dark imagery that increases the creep factor extensively. The film is also suspenseful throughout, featuring plenty of genuine scares and surprises for the most part. However, as the film continues to run, it becomes obvious that we, the audience, are being set up for a switch in the film's basic premise. I figured out that they were all different personalities, but did not see Liotta being a convict, or the kid being the killer.The direction of the film is seemingly influenced in equal amounts by Fincher, Hitchcock and Agatha Christie, James Mangold has produced an interesting and intriguing piece.Throughout the film, I was impressed with the shooting and general ambiance created. The acting, whilst a tad patchy in places was convincing, and this aided the director in his attempts to inflict upon the audience suspense of Hitchcockian levels.The acting was decent, of course Liotta is as always the hot tempered guy about to blow in every scene, Cusack gives a great performance as always and I was surprised by Peets performance, she hold up with the other great actors on the set as if she had the same amount of acting experience with them. The chemistry was really good as well between the characters, even though most of the time they distrust each other.I essentially believe that this film is worth watching for all fans of a wide range of genres: the thriller, horror, and pure whodunits (especially anyone who has read Christie's And Then There Were None). This is a film that tries to throw a twist in and actually succeeds with it.",8,1,2,14 February 2005
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Holy Cuss, This Film Is Great
","Giving up his life of a chicken thief because of a child on the way, Mr. Fox gets a job as a newspaper writer and lives underground. Years pass, his child is older and he wants to move to a tree and not feel poor anymore. Along the way he takes in his nephew and decides to steal again, from the three biggest farmers no less. The farmers get wise and start a battle against Mr. Fox, his family and all their creature friends. At first I didn't know if I wanted to see this, the animation looked really bad. But after thinking about it for a bit, I found that it fit into Anderson's style, it was something that he would do. So I gave the film a shot and I'm glad I did. This film has Anderson's signature style all over it, right down to the obvious voice casting, which has the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Owen Wilson, and Willem Dafoe.A lot of people, and I'm including myself in this bunch, might think nothing of this film. After all, it doesn't have the bright, adventurous feel of the recent Disney/Pixar films that have been dominating the animation scene. I'd even throw Dreamworks into that bunch. Those films are done by people who are at ease in their field, animated director like Brad Bird and John Lasseter know their way around the animation style. Yet here comes auteur Wes Anderson, who has a unique style and sense of comedy. His transition to animation, stop motion animation no less, is smart, funny and a pleasure. Is it his best film? Of course not, but it's one of the more enjoyable ones.The voice cast all work well, Clooney does a good job as the lead. He has that leadership tone in his voice, that arrogance that is needed for the character. Streep isn't given much to do, so her role as the wife is pretty basic, as is the character. Their son Ash, voice by Bored To Death star Jason Schwartzman was a stand out for me, as was Eric Chase Anderson, as Kristofferson. That name might not sound familiar, that's because his resume only consists of Anderson films. Bill Murray plays a badger and Fox's lawyer, who advises him not to buy the tree house. Fox does anyway and that's why he's in this mess. The animals are really small and live in this world where there are apparently small motorbikes for them to use. They can communicate with the human characters, no one seems to find it odd in this little world they live in. You won't find it odd either, you'll just be enjoying the fun.Each chapter is subtitled, Fox's Master Plan A, Fox's Master Plan B, etc. They even tell you how time passes in human years and fox years and in a comical bit one human hour compare to one fox hour. You never know how long these hours are in comparison to each other, you don't want to know either, it just adds to the uniqueness of the film. At heart, these characters are still wild animals, as Fox even says this in the film, and the way they eat and 'fight' each other proves this. The film has that Anderson humour and might go over some kids heads. It's dark in some places, as one character dies, but I think they will enjoy it. They won't jump up and down for it like Up, or Finding Nemo. They won't want to go out and buy the latest Mr. Fox stuffed animal or toy. This feels more like a film for adults, it doesn't really cater to the kids, but they will have their bits to laugh at, like the possum who stares blankly at some people for whatever reason. This film was made from scratch, this world Anderson creates is fun and I had a fun time being in it. The film flies by it's running time and I never found the film dragging. It was in and out. As stated before, the kids might enjoy this, but it's more for adults. There's smoking and there's even a unique way of swearing, which I found funny. The camera movements scream Wes Anderson and if you're a fan, then you will enjoy this very much. One of my favourite films of the year.",8,56,77,6 December 2009
Speed," Pop Quiz Hot Shot!!!!
","'I saw this movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'.' - Homer SimpsonThat pretty much sums up this film, but to go a bit more in depth...A disgruntled ex cop takes his issues out on other people with the creative use of bombs. Keanu Reeves saves the day by stopping an elevator bombing scare. This pisses Dennis Hopper off so much that he devises a new plan of putting a bomb on a bus. If the bus goes below 50, the bomb will go off. Can Keanu save the day?And will we ever see a movie like this again? There is something about this film that makes it special. The action blockbuster that ignited the careers of both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. The film does not require a strong leading man, just someone who is able to pull off these stunts. Reeves is able to make it look legit and even though people complain about his acting, he is in no way irritating. Bullock spends most of the film behind the wheel of the bus, so of course she falls in love with the guy. Wait, what? Ah, who cares, right? This kind of stuff always happened in the 90's. Girl falls in love with the good looking guy who saves the day. But those relationships never last (evidence in the lame sequel)Dennis Hopper is one bad ass guy. He plays crazy so well, his role here is not Blue Velvet Frank Booth crazy, but cray nonetheless. The film is even more enjoyable due to the supporting cast of characters that are on the bus with the two stars. Jeff Daniels plays the buddy cop part, but due to the events in the opening of the film, has to stay at home for the exciting parts on the bus. With the exception of the bus jumping the gap in the highway scene, which makes me roll my eyes every single time, the film is entertaining and will keep your interest. For a film to take place on a bus for 80% of the film, they did a really good job of not letting that annoy the audience. The film is the perfect formula for action junkies. It has a lot of those adrenaline rush scenes. For me it kind of looses it's steam when the film goes to the subway, but that doesn't ruin the overall excitement and feel of the film.Speed is one of the best action films of the 90's. There, I said it. I can probably sit down and watch it and never really feel bored. Kudos for making the film watchable many times and still have that rush. A lot of action films on repeat viewings loose that.",8,1,2,30 May 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," 'The Best Action Film Of Recent Years'
","In the year 1988 there was a man running around a high rise building with no shoes on. In 1990, this same man was running around again, this time in an airport fighting a guy who likes to pose naked in his hotel rooms. Then in 1995, this same man drove around NYC trying to solve numerous riddles. Now the year is 2007 and this same man now must stop hackers corrupting the United States Government and the entire country. Sounds pretty rough to us, well it's just another day in the life of John McClane.Before the release of this film, many die hard DIE HARD fans (like that one eh?) were up in arms over not one, not two, but numerous things about this flick. One, would be the absurd PG-13 (14A) rating, whereas all the other DIE HARD films had R ratings, this was the first film in the series without it. Two, McClane's so called sidekick was a MAC...sorry I mean Justin Long. Third, the man behind the lens was Len Wiseman, whose resume was UNDERWORLD...and it's sequel. Finally Willis was old, pass his 50's old, could he still have the McClane charm and make it believable? No, things were not looking all too well for the next DIE HARD film, that is until it was finally released and blew everyone away. Myself included.I will admit I was never head over heels in love with the first Die Hard film. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not the be all to end all action film that everyone made it out to be. I give it credit for what it did, which was start a trend of films that would later be called ' Die Hard On A.....Die Hard In A....' Those titles go for films such as SPEED or Sudden Death. I prefer Vengeance to be honest. Throughout the series to settings grew bigger and bigger, from a high rise building, to an airport, to a city and now the entire country. Live Free Or Die Hard is ambitious, violent, funny, and clich√©d. So what I'm trying to say here is that it's the best action film of recent years. While CRANK tried it's best to inject live into a dead genre, it's this film that finally did it.First off, the PG-13 rating will have no affect on your views for this film. you're too busy being blown back into your seat to even notice. The film has dropped the F-bombs, but has thrown in more bombs itself. Live Free or Die Hard is the most violent of the Die Hard films, and yet it probably shows the least amount of blood. It's the 'action violence' that sets it apart. Everything is taking place on a grander scale, making everything seem more significant and bigger then ever before. Die Hard was the one of the first films to be deemed the 'Ultimate Guy Flick', Live Free or Die Hard is one film that is challenge that role. It so desperately wants to be the ultimate guy flick and it almost succeeds.This film does what it does best, entertains. I guarantee you, that you are going to see this film for the action. You will not be disappointed. It is above and beyond in action. It even plays on the old tired action film clich√©s, which brings it into a self parody, but that's okay because will all know that no one is taking anything seriously here. Just listen to the plot to know that, don't even have to mention the car crashing into the helicopter scene. It's the clich√©s that actually bring the film higher. You know from the beginning that his 'partner' is going to be the wise-ass, guess what he is. Long serves as the comic relief, the young and hip kid to Willis' old and tired McClane. His daughter, who wants nothing to do with him will need her father in the end, as she will be kidnapped and the dad must do what he does best to get her back. The main villain being in love with a woman who is also one of the main villains. Not to mention the series famous catch phrase.No one in this film is getting an Oscar anytime soon, but they play their roles to their beat. McClane is his joke spewing self, who shoots more bad guys in one day then most cops do their whole lives. Long plays his comedic young counterpart with just enough humour and just enough fear to play into the old/young relationship clich√©s. Winstead as the daughter who hates/loves her father and even Olyphant as the bad guy with the cold dead menacing stare.I don't know what it is about the old beloved character, but with Stallone's Balboa and Willis' McClane, it seems that old things never die. It's up to Ford and his fedora to see if we can make it three for three. The film is about 30 minutes too long, but with all the action on the screen you won't care. This is a summer flick that actually delivers on it's promises. Boom, Boom, Boom. One gripe I have though is that there is so much action going on that not one scene particularly stuck out in my mind as the 'DIE HARD' scene. In the original it's the jump from the explosion, with hose wrapped around him. The sequel is the cockpit ejection and third is the cable jump to boat. This film, even in it's jet-plane climax, has no real 'DIE HARD HERO SHOT' that I wanted to see. Other then those minor gripes that I personally have, this was a big surprise to me. Other then Grindhouse and 300, I had the most fun at this film this year.",8,0,4,29 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," A sequel that outshines the original.
","An attempt on the Presidents life doesn't help the X-men's cause for peace between mutants and mankind. Magneto is still up to no good and a new enemy surfaces, Stryker, who seems to have a past with Wolverine. Wolverine tries to find answers to his past through this mysterious man who wants to kidnap mutants. X2 opens with a bang and is one of the best scenes in the entire trilogy. We are introduced to a popular x-men character, who is visualized perfectly and is one of the best character adaptations the films have ever done and the sequence itself is entertaining. So much that it immediately grabs you and tells you that this film is a sequel that outshines the original and it does. Bryan Singer took the flaws of the original and fixed them here, he makes a sequel that is not only bigger, but better. Many times sequels fall under it's own need to do things on a grander scale, but here it works. We are introduced to some new characters, such as Nightcrawler, Pyro and Lady Deathstrike. All three of these characters shine in this film and elevate it to making this sequel the best in the series. Deathstrike has a brutal and violent fight scene with Wolverine, it seems he has finally me his match this time around. Styker is played by Brian Cox, he is deliciously evil and a nice face to see against the x-men then just having it be Magneto again. The action sequences are better here, more rough and tough. They are choreographed to make it not only more real, but more entertaining. They fit the comic book form a little more here than in the previous installment. The risk in this film seems a bit greater as well, the stakes are risen in the sequel and it makes us care more about the characters and the outcome then what one would initially think.Halle Berry and her role as Storm is still one of the weakest parts of the series. Her lines fall flat and her sincerity doesn't seem genuine. Her bits with Nightcrawler seem forced and she somehow manages to take one of the coolest characters from the comics and make her quite lame here. James Marsden improves here as Cyclops, he has more emotional baggage to carry here than last time. It's always hard to act when your eyes are covered, I give him credit despite having less screen time.This film is darker, not everyone makes it out alive. It sets up one of the best story lines the comics have ever introduced, the Dark Phoenix Saga. The script is tighter as is the acting. Rogue is still an annoying teen, but she has matured a bit since last time. The special effects are improved and the direction is more polished. If I were to point anyone into the direction of an x-men film, this is the one I'd tell them to watch.",8,0,1,26 June 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," 'It's true. All of it. The Dark Side, the Jedi. They're real.'
","If there is one film that cannot and will not live up to the hype that surrounds it, it is this one right here. Much like Episode I: The Phantom Menace, there is simply too much riding on it and people will tear it down regardless and there are some people out there doing that right now. Some of their complaints are warranted, others are simply fan boys being idiots. 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi things haven't been all peachy for our heroes. Luke Skywalker is currently in hiding, being the last remaining Jedi. Everyone is searching for him, the Resistance, led by his sister Leia and the First Order who have a powerful Sith on their side. With word that there is a clue on the planet Jakku leading to his whereabouts, everyone scrambles to find it. Some of the biggest complaints about this film is how it closely resembles A New Hope. The similarities can be off putting at times and this is no doubt, Abrams and co simply giving us some fan service, but the film holds its own and it one entertaining thrill ride from start to finish. How closely does this film feel? We have secret information being stored in droids, who must find others to relay the information. We have an orphaned junk trader who lives on a desert planet being thrust into something she cannot handle, yet seems destined for greater things. A giant planet destroying death ray that has weaknesses that X-wing fighter pilots try to exploit and destroy. A villain who covers his face with a black mask while using a lightsaber and the force. A plan is set in motion to rescue someone being held on a ship and a few more little things here and there. Some people can chalk this up to an admirable homage to what started this whole thing, others will cry foul about unoriginal writing and rehashed plot points. Me? It didn't bother me too much. A few times I sat there thinking that I've seen this all before, but that did not stop my enjoyment of it.Abrams has successfully rebooted two sci/fi franchises, some would say duelling franchises, but can't we all just have some fun? As a fan of the films growing up, he put on the screen what he thought we would want to see. For the most part, he succeeds. This is a film for the fans of the series. It sets up new characters well enough to want us to continue this adventure with them. Daisy Ridley's Rey, is a welcomed strong female addition to a series that lacked one. John Boyega plays Finn, a conflicted stormtrooper that just wants to do what is right. Oscar Isaac is the Resistance best pilot and he enjoys nothing more than being up in the sky. Those are our new faces of heroes. Joining them are the familiar faces of Ford's Solo and Fischer's Leia. Ford has the most screen time out of the returning cast members and his sharp tongue hasn't left him. He may be older, but he's still fighting the good fight, even if he doesn't want to. Fischer on the other hand seems stale. Her performance is one note and phoned in. Was she not happy with her lack of screen time? It didn't really feel like the same character to me.Driver's villainous Kylo Ren is not like Vader. He's younger, more prone to violent mood swings and still hasn't grappled the full powers of the force. Yet he is a dangerous weapon and one to fear. Driver does well enough behind the mask, yet there are moments when I had a hard time taking him seriously when it was removed. I guess it's because I've seen him in too many comedies to fear the likes of his ugly mug. Yes, the effects are great, this we all know. The story, while familiar is still engaging enough for us to care. I enjoyed the new characters and want to see their arcs progress. I want to know what is going to happen next and they do a good job of leaving us wanting more. The film isn't perfect, but it's a spectacle to see on the big screen for sure. Don't go in expecting the second coming of Chirst, go in being a kid again. See old friends and believing in the magic of movies again.",8,2,29,19 December 2015
RED," The Losers, The A-Team, The Expendables....RED.
","R.E.D stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. That's what has been tagged to Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) and he is a target of a hit. The ones trying to kill him underestimated his skills and he is out on a mission to find out who is trying to kill him and his maybe girlfriend (Mary-Louise Parker). So he rounds up the gang and they set out to find out who is behind everything. RED is pretty much exactly like the other films I mentioned before (Losers, A-Team, Expendables) with only difference is that this film's angle is that the people who are dangerous are retired old people. The cast has Bruce Willis, doing his John McClane thing without the one-liners and more precision. Morgan Freeman pulling his Wanted role but in a good guy role. John Malkovich playing a retired CIA test subject that has been given daily doses of LSD for 11 some odd years. He seems like one of the Malkovich's that crawled out of the tunnel to his body in Being John Malkovich. Helen Mirren, in an offbeat choice. She plays sexy and dangerous and can hold her own against the boys. Karl Urban is the lead CIA officer sent to take them out, he plays his assassin role from Bourn Supremacy. He follows orders, not knowing if he is doing good or bad. Of course we have the Mary-Louise Parker character, who is like the audience, not knowing any of these things we are experiencing and are along for the ride. Malkovich steals the show. He plays the role of conspiracy nut with a gun very well. He's off kilter and has the funniest bits in the film. The film is based on a comic book so you can expect over the top action and stunts. A revolver showdown versus a bazooka? Check. Playing baseball with a grenade? Check. Casually exiting a vehicle spinning out of control and nearly getting hit by the bumper while shooting at another vehicle and not blink an eye? Check. RED is over the top and funny. If you enjoyed The Losers or the A-team, Red is more of the same. I enjoyed it, the plot revolves around a cover up and an old job that comes to bite those RED members in the behind. The twists it tries to give us is half baked but forgivable because the film is, overall an enjoyment. I must criticize the relationship between Bruce Willis and Mary- Louise Parker, it doesn't seem fleshed out enough to be taken at face value. They chit chat over the phone and he kidnaps her to protect her from people who are trying to kill her because he has had so many phone conversations with her. She ends up liking the thrill and excitement of his life, yet he says that she makes him feel like he can have a normal life. This conflict is never resolved or brought up again. Morgan Freeman doesn't have enough screen time and the role could have been played by virtually anyone. Karl Urban is a likable guy, I seem to appreciate his role in everything he does, even if the film turns out to be uneven. He's good here too jumping onto moving vehicles to catch other moving vehicles (did I mention this film is over the top?) RED is enjoyable and like I said, fans of those previously mentioned films will get a kick out of this one. It blends comedy and action well enough to pass the time. It's enjoyment hangs on the fact that these old people are kicking ass. It works. I keep mentioning how over the top it is, but it never reaches the heights of the over the topness of the A-Team. If that is any indication of this style of violence. I forgot to mention Brian Cox, he plays a Russian who becomes an integral part of the 'team'. Poor guy is nowhere to be seen in the promotional ads for the film and yet he has more screen time than Freeman. Anyways, RED is good popcorn fun. It's problems are obvious ones for a film like this, but the direction is slick and the film is funny.",7,3,9,16 October 2010
Rear Window," So Simple and Yet So Effective.
","Bart Simpson breaks his leg when the family gets a new swimming pool. He is stuck in his room with a cast on his leg and he is bored out of his mind....oops wrong synopsis. Sub Jimmy Stewart for Bart Simpson and you have your story of Rear Window. L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries suspects his neighbour has killed his own wife and tries to solve the mystery while stuck in his wheelchair. The premise is pretty simple, yet Hitchcock gives us something more with this film, he gives us exactly what our society craves voyeurism. Even to this day we can't go by without thinking or wanting or actually trying to peak into the lives of others.Rear Window marks my fourth Hitchcock film I've seen, yet it sneaks into my favourite spot. Is it boring for someone to say that one of the more popular Hitchcock films is currently his favourite? I don't care, I know a good film when I see one and Rear Window is just that. More than 50 years later this film manages to still be relevant today and hold up successfully well in the suspense department. The recent Shia LaBeouf remake Distrubia, while a good thriller, suffers from the technology syndrome. Years from now the film will be dated with that ankle bracelet technology holding Shia in, just like the giant cell phone Zack Morris carries with him everywhere. Rear Window doesn't feel dated and this is credited to Hitchcock and his attention to detail. I absolutely love, adore and cherish the art direction in this film. How beautiful is the set design? Knowing that they used the basement as part of the set design only heightens my enjoyment of it. The second floor of the apartments was actually the stage floor. Stunning in my opinion. The opening scene giving us a glimpse into the lives of the people who live in the apartments around Stewart is marvelous. We never go into their lives, we just see it from Stewarts (and our) viewpoint. We never leave his room, save for the ending and a scene that involves the death of a dog. Those close ups of the people listening to the lady yelling seem out of place because we immediately jump out of Stewart's room and into the open area. It's alarmingly jarring and seems out of place for no apparent reason.Hitchcock ones again proves us that a good story (he most certainly had his hand in crafting the story) trumps everything else. How suspenseful can a film be when our hero never leaves his room, hell he never really leaves his wheelchair. Hitchcock manages to pull it off gracefully. It's nice to see where films today get their inspiration from. When the lights in the hallway go out at Stewart's apartment, I thought of No Country For Old Men. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense. Grace Kelly is absolutely stunning. I never really cared for the looks of the actresses of the old 50's or 60's. None of them caught my eye, Grace Kelly think is the first one to do so. I don't even think Marilyn Monroe did. Her introduction shot is graceful and most certainly memorable. I can't finish this review without mentioning Thelma Ritter. She was hilarious and everything she did felt so natural. I absolutely loved her character. Rear Window is more suspenseful today than most thrillers that come to theatres. The little glimpses into the lives of the people around the setting is what really drew me in though, the song writer, Miss Torso, Miss Hearing Aid, and the balcony couple. These are nice little addition from the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock.",9,0,1,4 August 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Cinematic Brilliance
","SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!My friend asked me if I wanted to go, I said okay, but he didn't want to leave until 7:30. Of course I knew we would get bad seats, and we did. 3rd row from the very front, far, far left. My neck still hurts. I had nothing to eat or drink, people were talking throughout the opening scenes. Yet this did nothing to distract me or harm the movie in any way.Let me start off by saying and you can quote me on this 'Move over Star Wars, there's a new trilogy in cinema' This movie (movies) are amazing. Lord of the Rings is the best trilogy out there and will be for some time. The matrix's last installment full flat, I have not seen Godfather, Evil Dead is a cult classic trilogy and Star Wars just lost the top spot. I seriously believe Jackson will get Best Director and this movie 'deserves' to have Best Picture, even though the Academy will fuck it's chances over and this will be one of the biggest snubs ever on the Oscars.I'll begin with the CGI. If you thought the first two had great CGI, you haven't seen anything yet. Gollum, of course looks amazing and it is so believable that he is a character on the screen. 'He is there, you believe it, he is not cgi' The way he talked to himself was better than the way it was presented in The Two Towers, the water reflection was so beautiful and imaginative. When he is atop of Frodo and bites his finger off, it was amazing; I was actually in awe, CGI on top of CGI. The battle, what an amazing battle, if you thought the battle at Helm's Deep was amazing, cool, the best, then you are in store for something spectacular. You will get your socks knocked off. The battle scene is the absolute best battle scene ever created. The bodies, the emotion, the action, the excitement, the chills, the suspense, the cheers, the tears. This battle had it all. The men who were cursed, beautiful, how they tore that motherfucker down. In Fellowship of the Ring, we see Legolas climb atop of a Cave Troll; yes it did look fake, cheesy. In Two Towers, we see him do some weird stunt to climb back onto his horse, it also looked weird and fake. In Return Of The King, he takes down the elephant and all the men on it. This wasn't fake, this wasn't weird or cheesy. It looked beautiful, it looked real, it was amazing. He did it with ease as well, and as he counted his victims, brings down the big boy, gimli (serving as comic relief only) still states that the one only counted as one.The acting, was utterly 'uber' great. Aragorn IS the king, he is the man, the legend, Mortesen is the one and only person who can play him, who can bring him to life, he is Aragorn. Everyone did their part, and boy did I ever hate the 'filler king' He p*ssed me off so much, I actually liked it. Merry and Pippen, were extraordinary, this movie is where they shine. Sam, I think everyone knows what a great actor Astin is, and what a GREAT job he did with Sam, I honestly believe that he should be up for supporting actor. He almost made me cry, the emotion was utterly amazing. Hate, Anger, Love, Fear, Sadness. He brought all of these emotions into this character and he did it extremely well. Frodo...what can I say, you are a troubled young...err..old hobbit. You are tired, you cannot go on...you trust the untrustworthy, you are fearful of a giant Shelob. You have courage and find the strength to go on and destroy the ring, only to be consumed by it's evil power, and want the ring for yourself. Agent Smith/Lord Elrond...one word, GREAT. I believed Liv Tyler should of had at least 5 more minutes of screen time, but with the time she did have, she made me believe that she truly was in love with Aragon and willing to become mortal.The direction, Peter Jackson is my new Favourite director. Yes, I have seen his previous films before he did Lord of the Rings, yes I loved them, but this 'EPIC' trilogy, has made him the man. Only a true fan of Tolkien and Lord of the Rings, could of brought this masterpiece to film, creating another masterpiece. You honestly deserve to win best director, for conveying epic battle sequences, strong emotions, bringing something fake to life (Gollum). I don't know anyone else who could of done this, and if he is not behind the camera for The Hobbit, then it should not be made.The characters, one of the things that I love about the books/movies are the characters. Their fears, their anger, their courage, their optismistic approach on life. Eowyn (sp) Not very convincing in Two Towers, but amazing in this installment, I could not believe it. She is a warrior. Everyone cheered when she took off her helmet and said 'I am no man'. Then stuck that sword right into the f***er. Merry and Pippen have love for each other and you can feel it, when they say goodbye to each other, you can feel their pain, there sadness. Gimli, was really funny as well as Gandalf, who is just as always, excellently portrayed by Ian Mckellen. Everyone cheered again when Gandalf took over command of Minus Tirith (sp).The movie itself, was just brilliant. It deserves everything it gets, and should get more. I felt sad when Frodo was back at the Shire, in his little home all alone, a huge adventure had just happened, how can you go back to your normal life? You made courages friendships, with man, drawf and elf. Now you're back with hobbits, I saw their expressions in the pub, just before Sam got married (yeah all the girls cheered) I know how they feel, The adventure was EPIC, the adventure was Amazing, it's sad to watch the movies all in a row, I know I will cry when I do (not only because my ass will hurt from 9-13 hours either. My uncle asked me a year ago, what movie has changed my life, what movie made me look at movies in a different way. I didn't know the answer yet, he told me for him it was Star Wars, his whole generation loves Star Wars. Well, there is a new generation. Lord of the Rings has and will change the way we look at movies today. It has a new following (yeah, someone dressed up as a hobbit). I will have these films on DVD, Extended Edition. a friend today asked me four questions. Was it good? YES. Good enough for Best Picture? Yes. Good enough for Best Director? Yes. Where did you sit? In a bad spot.10/10",10,0,0,21 December 2003
The Purge," The Purge should have and could have been so much better.
","The year is 2022, crime is at an all-time low of 1%. This is due to an act known as The Purge. For a 12 hour period, all crime including murder is legal. The Sanders family is about it feel the ramifications of this act.This concept, although absurd, is something that could have been an intense thrilling horror show. The concept is a great one for entertainment. Yet The Purge fails to capitalize on this concept and instead it confines itself to a one location low budget thrill show in the style of 2008's The Strangers. There are many areas this film could have excelled at, but unfortunately misses the mark on most of them.I imagine if James DeMonaco, the writer and director, who has worked with Hawke multiple times before, had expanded his story to take place outside one house, the results might have been much better. Think of the creativity of the kills, the thrills of the chase, the dangers of not knowing who else is out there. Instead we are stuck inside a house with some stupid characters who do stupid things only to advance the plot. you'll find yourself yelling at some of the characters, specifically the son, who is responsible for this whole mess the family find themselves in. The young lad lets in a wounded man who is being hunted by a group of teens of are taking part in the Purge. They know the guy is in the house, so they will do anything to get in. Of course to make the film more entertaining, they eventually do. Then it becomes a cat and mouse game between the family stuck inside and the would be killers with masks. The leader of this gang is a rich kid who is mild mannered and is willing to kill his best friend if he becomes annoying. While the character is somewhat interesting, this film desperately needed a more prominent villain. Key elements like this could only make the film better. I feel like there was a good film in here somewhere but certain choices hinder it from becoming something that people will talk about years from now. One decision I think it failed at was the ending. The Purge had the chance to end on a real downer, something depressing and shocking that will get people talking. Instead it ends on a predictable note, which leaves you completely dissatisfied. The Purge should have ended with a bang, not a whimper.",5,1,2,6 July 2013
Munich," Spielberg Is Back At Directing Good Films.
","The year is 1972 and Palestinian terrorist have eleven Israeli hostages from the Olympcis in Munich. After a shootout and explosions, the deaths of the Israeli Olympians send shock waves through the nation. Avner, an Israeli Mossad officer is given the task of killing those responsible for Munich. Avner and his team begin their mission and it costs them more then they could have expected.Spielberg's last couple of films have been sub-par at best and seems funny to me that this wave of lackluster films started off as crap and ended off as crap. Both A.I. and War of the Worlds were not of Spielberg's caliber, but now he has made his best film since Saving Private Ryan and is back at directing good films.Munich is an intense film, it has haunting images, especially the opening segments with the terrorist taking the Israeli hostages. Unlike most films today, Munich is grounded. When people are shot, you see it's grittiness, people don't fly backwards. It's message of violence never solves anything is evident in the film's own violence. From being stabbed in the face with a butcher knife, to being shot in the throat naked. Munich does not go light on the realism of violence.Bana leads the cast with a great performance, much better then his previous efforts Hulk and Troy, even if he was the best thing in Troy. One scene that connects with the audience is when Bana is talking to his daughter on the phone, when his child says 'dada' for the first time, the tears of joy and fear are immediately brought to Bana's eyes. He is overjoyed with the fact that he hears his daughter and she knows it's her father, but also fears that if he continues on with the mission, he may never be able to see her. Beautifully done scene, Bana expresses his emotions perfectly and Spielberg captures it all on screen.Spielberg's last few films have been below his level of directing, War of the Worlds, The Terminal, and Catch Me If You Can were decent films, but not of Spielberg's usual caliber. With Munich Spielberg has directed his best film since Saving Private Ryan. Straight from the start we see the talent of Spielberg as he inter-cuts the actual events of the hostage situation and what Spielberg has recreated. The film runs 163 minutes long, but Spielberg's style is gripping enough to keep us wanting more. Spielberg's visual style is back, with Bana going through the difficulty of his first kill, the blood mixing with the milk from the groceries the victim was carrying is horrifying. Spielberg handles a difficult subject very well showcasing the faults of both sides. The films faults are few, but the are faults that effect the film nonetheless. The Twin Towers and the sex scene at the end. To me it felt like a Gatorade commercial, with Bana's sweat flying all over the place. You knew that Spielberg was going to inter-cut this scene with the massacre of the hostages and it doesn't fit too well. Running fifteen some odd minutes short of three hours, Munich does drag in some scenes, but others are so intense, that it makes up for it.The film is controversial and will challenge you to think if what they did was justified. You can make your own judgement on that, but we see the horrors that plague Bana after his mission was 'over'. Trying to cope with his ordinary life with his family, looking over his soldier for somebody that may have a target on him. Paraniod and Depressed is how he feels after his actions, not being able to sleep, always looking out his window. Whether you can connect with it's characters or not, you have to give sympathy for the hardships that he had to endure, and will endure.In Munich we get a glimpse of what Bond will look like in the upcoming Casino Royale. As Spielberg gives Craig a silenced handgun, it screams bond and was humorous to see. You may not cry at this film, but you will be changed in some way. It's intensity and message is conveyed clearly and will affect those we see this film. Steven Spielberg creates a film that has impressive acting, beautiful visuals and a tight script which all make Munich a perfect choice for a Best Picture Nominee at the Oscars.",8,2,3,10 January 2006
Godzilla," Now With 100% Less Matthew Broderick
","A nuclear meltdown 15 years ago bears striking resemblance to some current issues with the area now. What secrets are the government hiding away in the quarantined zone? When a freak of nature breaks lose from the cocoon it was encased in, another comes in to restore balance to the nature of things, while we try to get in his way....he is Godzilla.There's a lot going on in Godzilla, so I'll give it credit for trying to bring something to the table that the original Americanized version did not. The size and scope of this entry is bigger and better. Gareth Edwards, the guy behind the independent special effects heavy flick Monsters, has been given a monster size of a budget to direct this decades old creature and possible restart a franchise. His delivery of Godzilla is a mess, but it beautiful mess.The film is gorgeous to look at. Seeing the destruction of the world while these massive beasts tango is a marvellous achievement. Edwards teases the audience a lot here. Just when we are about to see the showdown, he cuts away and we only get glimpses of it on the television. A neat way to build up our anticipation for the destruction that is sure to ensue in the climax. He does this one too many times though and the teases become irritating. Show us what we want: Destruction, Mayhem, GODZILLA. The special effects are astounding, that's a given. Edwards fully develops these creatures in a life like environment and the destruction they cause feels real. The size and scope of these creatures are leaps and bounds over what Emmerich gave us in the late 90's. The fighting between the monsters is a little rough, Del Toro has more of a craft to it with Pacific Rim. Here it feels more like a brawl, rightfully so. Godzilla does the cardinal sin of false advertising. I can't really fault the film for this, but I do feel that it was a mistake creatively to kill off certain characters early in the film. There is no emotional catalyst for our lead hero here. It feels forced to try and make those connections it desperately wants the viewer to see and brings the film to sometimes boring sections. The human characters fill out their clich√©d roles fine enough. Cranston is dynamite as the guy who is right about ominous things, but nobody believes him. Johnson is our lead, a good guy with father issues, trying to make it back home to his family and be the dad he never had. David Strathairn does his Jason Bourn military shtick and finally we have two actors who do absolutely nothing in the film. First is Ken Watanabe with very few lines, but serious looks here and there. He's our 'let's explain everything' guy. The other is Elizabeth Olsen, who has done excellent work, as the wife of our lead. Her job is....I'm still confused here because she isn't even the damsel in distress. She is screen filler. Then last, but not least we have Godzilla, who is barely in the film. Cardboard characters are to be expected in a monster flick....but aren't monsters expected to be in monster flicks? The guy's name is on the poster and Godzilla has the least amount of screen time here. The other creatures are cool looking as well and I really got into the 'history' of when they first showed up and stuff, I just wish they explored that a tad bit more. The film is insanely serious. No real moments of brevity. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, in the hopes that they take this in some kind of direction and not chug out Godzilla VS whatever creature the fans want now....I have my hopes.",7,2,4,18 May 2014
Deadpool," 'Daddy needs to express some rage.'
","Deadpool, aka 'The Merc With A Mouth' made an appearance in Wolverine: Origins, played by Ryan Reynolds. The bits with Reynolds had him without a mask, but still the sassy attitude. He later appeared near the end, a bastardization of the character, this time played by Scott Adkins. This guy was known as Weapon XI, the next evolution of Wolverine? I'm still not sure because that film was a mess of epic proportions. The use of Deadpool in this film is a travesty and fans were obviously upset. Reynolds, who has been a champion of the character for years now, has tried and tried again to get a Deadpool feature film going. He has finally succeeded and now we have a 'proper' version of the character, one that fans seem to love and Reynolds is actually happy with. Deadpool is not your ordinary comic book character, for starters, he knows he's a comic book character. The film version knows he's in a film, he knows about the previous version of Deadpool and even the previous comic book character Reynolds played, The Green Lantern. I feel that some people may have had enough with the super hero genre, but Deadpool, much like Guardians of the Galaxy, is just unique enough to breathe some fresh air into an already bloated genre. Wade Wilson, Reynolds, is a mercenary for hire. While at his best friends bar, he runs into a beautiful woman, Vanessa, played by Morena Baccarin. They instantly hit it off and fall in love. He pops the question, expecting a long, loving life with the girl of his dreams. Things don't seem to work out for him though, as he is unexpectedly hit with cancer. Hitting the liver, lungs, prostate and brain. Not wanting to drag her through the heartbreak of watching him die, he vanishes. While gone he is presented with a new experimental program that could cure his cancer and make him super. Experiments never go accordingly to plan and Deadpool is now born. A mutant with healing properties, enhanced strength and scarred skin making him one of the ugliest men alive. Now he's out for revenge, to get the man who did this to him and hopefully make him right again. Deadpool had an uphill battle, a hard R rating, an unknown character outside of fanboys and Ryan Reynolds, a guy who desperately needs a hit. The film only got the greenlight due to an extremely positive reaction to leaked test footage, which has made it into the actual film, and it seems even more people want to see the film because it is doing extremely well. Does this mean we'll eventually see an influx of r rated super hero films? Maybe. But I doubt any of them will have the pure fun and energetic charm that Reynolds brings to this picture. Reynolds is a perfect Deadpool, he brings the character to life with the spot on comedic timing and self awareness. He brings his usual improv swagger to the role, if you're familiar with his comedic roles prior, it is on all cylinders here. With the R rating, he's able to let the risky profanity filled one liners fly. Some might feel it's a bit too much at times, others will say it fits the tone of the film perfectly. That R rating is well deserved as well. The film is full of profanity, nudity and extreme violence. People are decapitated, skewered, burned, crushed, blown-up and pretty much anything else you can imagine. This film is not kid friendly, despite the fact that there were a few children under the age of 14 in my showing. Despite the violence in the film, it is indeed very cartoon-like. Deadpool cuts his own arm off, cgi blood sprays on the face of another character, then he eventually grows a new arm. Most of the film sees bad guys simply be shot, with precision from the man in red. With a somewhat modest budget, for a superhero film, of only 58 million, the film waits to use the majority of that budget for the last act. The film jumps back and forth between the present and the past. As for as origin stories go, it's pretty run of the mill. Experiment gone wrong and hero seeks revenge. Seems almost like Wolverine and a lot of others. The familiarity of the film didn't bother me because it had a lot of fun with it. A lot of films feel held back by their origins story, Deadpool isn't one of them. Despite some of the juvenile humour, Deadpool is a lot of fun. A lot of bloody, violent, profanity filled fun.",8,4,14,15 February 2016
Get Him to the Greek," The bit players make the film work.
","A young intern at a record company is given the task of escorting an old and out of control rock star to the Greek theatre, for a comeback gig that will earn the company millions. Was the character from Forgetting Sarah Marshall really likable, or popular enough to warrant a spin-off film? Someone thought so, thus we have Get Him To The Greek, where Russell Brand plays Aldous Snow. While he has had smaller roles in other films, it's this flick and Marshall, where people recognize him. Those who do not know this is a spin off might think he is a note note actor. We'll see when more work goes his way. Jonah Hill does his thing, make snide comic remarks at situations that seem to be one of the chosen bits from a line- o-rama piece. Just have him stand there, spit out random things that are funny and we'll pick the best one. I hope his style doesn't get old fast, or he's in trouble. The film works for the most part, it's not as funny as you'd want it to be. The people that make this film funny are the supporting characters. Brand and Hill are probably the least funniest thing about this film. Sean 'P.Diddy' Combs stands out, surprisingly. He has the comedic chops that fit this film and he worked it well. Colm Meaney, a character actor notorious for playing a-holes is hilarious as Snow's father. His scenes are great as well.Get Him To The Greek is mild entertainment, there are far more funnier films out there than this one and the characters are pretty generic that you don't seem to care if they make it to the theatre or not. One of the weaker Apatow style films, which is a shame because it has a lot of talent. Get Him To The Greek, is as I initially expected, a mediocre comedy that barely gets the laughs out. Still, it's funnier than a lot of comedies that came out the same year.",5,1,5,10 January 2011
Cloud Atlas," The Best Picture To Not Win Best Picture This Year
","How does one describe Cloud Atlas? Indescribable is a good place to start. Here we have the most ambitious film of the year, probably of the decade (yes, I'm including you Avatar) and there is simply no way to describe it. What I can tell you is that the film explores 6 different stories spanning a vast amount of time and space. Connected to each story is the soul, love, death and life that encompasses us all. Cloud Atlas isn't here to obey narrative structure, classically filmmaking nor does it try to please the masses. It's simply an experience, a dream like experience that will stay with you long after you witness it. The Wachowski Siblings and Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) embark on a journey and ask us, the viewer to go on that journey with them. This journey isn't supposed to make some kind of logical sense, or have a sense of familiarity. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. Our lives in this world are small in nature, big in scope. If you want to witness something fresh, exciting that pushes the boundaries and makes you think, then see Cloud Atlas.Prometheus was suppose to be the film of the year that made us ponder about our existence and what lies beyond our own world. It failed. Where that film fails, Cloud Atlas succeeds. Abandon the idea that the film is 6 stories and accept that it is one. Each segment blends itself into the next. Some people will try and fail, to see literal connections between each one. We are connected by love, life and death, wanting to see more of a connection between each segment will have you hating everything. This film is not a typical film. We are not given ten minutes of each segment before going onto the next. The film is not told that way, instead it is brilliantly edited to the beat of a heart, the notes on a music sheet, the breaths we take. It's flawless in its presentation. Can a killer in one story, be a hero in another? Played by the same actor, is this the same soul? There is without a doubt, one image that connects every segment. It's a birthmark in the shape of a shooting star/comet. Is this the same person, reincarnated in the next life? The film won't answer your questions, it doesn't want to, or even need to. Having those actors play several roles is an inspired choice. Half the joy of the film is discover who is playing which character. By the credits, all is revealed and some are a shock to see. The make-up effects are astounding. Well recognizable actors disappear behind the make- up, changing sex or race. One hiccup, if I may say, is that we still cannot age our actors correctly. Hugh Grant looks like he is wearing a mask, instead of playing Jim Broadbent's brother. Clocking in at just under 3 hours, the film may seem like a chore to get through, especially considering the amount of stories and characters is has to cover, but not once did I ever think the film was too long. Some stories do drag more than others, but never once did I think it was boring. We are too busy interweaving through time to be bored. If you are looking at this movie in terms of acting, writing, directing, you are looking at it wrong. Will there be another film like Cloud Atlas? Maybe. But the general movie going public isn't ready for a film like this. This is a polarizing film, it has to be, it needs to be, otherwise it doesn't work.",9,16,28,7 November 2012
300," '300 Has Bad-Ass Written All Over It'
","Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, '300' centres on the 300 Spartans that defended their freedom with their lives against an army of thousands.What can one say about '300' that hasn't already been said? One simply has to watch the trailer to know exactly what they are getting themselves into when they go to see '300', a visually stunning film that piles the bodies high and blood splatter higher. Without a well known cast and a director that only has one film under his belt it would take something impressive to attract people. The '300' trailer did just this, as hype of the film spread like wildfire throughout the internet and months before it's release was being hailed as the next big thing in cinema. Well, the film has finally arrived and it's safe to say that you can add it to the list along with: 'The Matrix', 'Star Wars', 'LOTR' and 'Citizen Kane' as films that have changed the way we look at cinema.'300' opens with a back-story to a normal starting life of a Spartan, if the baby is born too small or too weak, it's literally tossed off a cliff. Taught to fight as early as he can walk, the Spartan must learn to be tough and leave no room for weakness. Every Spartan must go through a test, in the film's case it was against a wolf. This has been done for years and you get the sense that these guys are serious.'300' is the second film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller. 'Sin City' generated the same amount of hype across the globe and has its own unique visual style. If 'Sin City' was the first step into the next generation of film, then '300' is a giant leap. Its beautiful colours are enough to draw an audience regardless of the films quality. Lucky for us it's not just its visual style that makes the film good. Shot entirely on green screen, Snyder is able to create a world full of muscular Spartans, ugly monsters and violent battle scenes, creatively and effectively. The tans/yellows of the battle ground provide a great backdrop for the red coated Spartans. Boy, does that red ever jump out at you too.Knowing the history of Spartans, the film is not totally accurate, but it gets the basics down. These warriors were born to be fighters and nothing else. The filmmakers intended to not be historically accurate in order to give an entertaining film, and it works like a charm. This is something 'Troy' and 'Alexander' suffered from greatly. Hearing the story that only 300 men defended themselves against thousands upon thousands could raise a few eyebrows. That's until you see these warriors and their lifestyles. They don't have normal professions back home. They're not blacksmiths or carpenters, as one character says, they're warriors, that's their profession. These men were meant to fight and the actors look spot on. Gerard Butler, whom I only recognize from the Tomb Raider sequel, embodies what a Spartan is. Here's a guy who made me believe he was an actual Spartan. He has just the right amount of honours and leadership to command the army and the film; he does so with ease. Hidden behind a beard and his helmet for most of the film, Butler pulls off a great performance of a man who is not afraid to be on the front lines in battle. It's an honest performance that could take some by surprise, if you think the film is only about yelling Sparta every couple of seconds, you're only half right.Snyder is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Here is a young guy with obvious talent, who took on two difficult films that had an audience before the film was released. Creating a worthy remake with 'Dawn of the Dead', Snyder tackled this project head on. Working on digital only enhances the creativity this guy can bring to a project. Only time will tell if he can solidify himself in the business with his next undertaking of 'The Watchmen'.Much like Miller's other work, '300' is a brutal film that doesn't let up with its content. The film tells you point blank that it's going to be bloody violent and it actually keeps its promise. Only once or twice does it slow down for some dialogue, to let the viewer settle down after watching an onslaught of violence. The violence is stylized, mixing fast and slow motion left right and centre. The blood is CGI and legs, heads and arms do fly off at every corner. But the violence is stylized so much, that in the end the gore factor doesn't seem like a lot. You know you're watching gory images, but it doesn't send chills down your spine, instead you simply think, 'That was cool'. The entire film plays out like a wet dream to every movie aficionado, video game player, comic book reader (sorry graphic novel reader) out there. It's a shame that Alan Moore hasn't had as good a time at the movies as Frank Miller has, graphic novel adaptations need visionary directors.I totally recommend '300', for anyone looking for a visionary film and who's not afraid of violence on the screen. It's a roller-coaster ride that only ends when the screen turns black. The final moments of the film gave me goose bumps and there are too many beautiful scenes to name one as my favourite. '300' earns its R rating; it's a hard nose slobber-knocker. The body count is in the thousands and the blood is in the gallons. For a fully enjoyable experience, one should see this on IMAX. If you really want to know what '300' is like, it's basically the trailer, extended past two hours.",9,5,12,9 March 2007
Cube," I Adore This Movie.
","I love this film, I simply cannot get enough of it.7 people wake in an enclosed cube, with a door on each side leading to another cube. Some of these cubes have traps in them. Can these 7 people survive long enough to find salvation? I love the concept and the team behind this film prove that you do not need a lot of money to make a great film, just passion. (side tidbit of info, the cost to re-dub the audio was more then the entire budget of the film).I love the ambiguity of this film, later to be ruined by the sequel/prequels. You never get any outside contact with anyone. You're stuck in this prison with the characters. With great use of colour, the filmmakers have created a sense of endless rows of hell and torture, when in reality there was really only one or two sets.The tension in this film is great, specifically the scene in which the trap is activated by sound. For films like this, it always gets my thinking about how I would react in this certain situation. I applaud films that make me think this way, it gets me engaged.There was no other way to end this film then the way they did and I was so happy they did it. Reading about the alternate ending and if they had thrown that it, I don't know if I could like this film as much as I do.I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good sci/fi flick. I watched it because it does have it's horror elements. The deaths are more gruesome then your run of the mill horror flicks these days. Just watch the first 5 minutes and you'll know what I'm talking about.",9,0,2,20 July 2009
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The best 'Twilight' film
","That's not saying much though, cause the film still lacks a lot of qualities that would deem a film enjoyable. They are pumping these films out like it's nobodies business and unfortunately they are making boatloads of cash. New Moon, the worst of the three, was misguided and had no interesting conflict, other than who Bella should date. Finally the series gives the viewers a showdown of violence as the 'vampires' and shape-shifters take on a new army of 'vampires'. There is a quote on the internet that best describes my feelings towards the series and it compares it to the other mega cash cow Harry Potter. 'Harry Potter is about confronting fears, finding inner strength and doing what is right in the face of adversity. Twilight is about how important it is to have a boyfriend.' Now, despite what you may think, I don't hate the series. If I did I wouldn't watch them and flame Twilight messageboards. Instead I go in with an open mind. Yet for some reason the series continues to impress me with how lazy and boring it is.I sit here wondering though, what could possibly happen in the next two films. I get the fact that they get married and have a kid, but it seems like a epilogue that is going to be stretched out way too long. The immediate conflict with Victoria is solved. So unless some kind of Volturi stuff happens (most likely), are two more films really necessary? The answer is no. They took a page right out of Harry Potter's book and decided to split the last film in two so they could make twice as much money. The young girls still flock to see a shirtless cry complain about wanting to be with a girl and a moody guy who no one understand but her. In real life do young girls have to choose between such an incredibly shallow pair of boys? Eclipse happens to have the best fight sequences and dialogue that doesn't suck. The characters finally seem comfortable in their roles, despite still not reaching what I would call, quality acting. Kristen Bell herself, for whatever reason, looks totally different in this film than the previous one. Not a complaint, just something I noticed. She still lacks the strength (if there were any to begin with) the character so desperately needs to be interesting. These characters don't really seem to change. They have been saying the same stuff in every single film. Jacob cries because he wants to be with Bella. Edward wants to be with Bella, but doesn't want her to become a 'vampire'. Bella still wants to leave any career aspirations at home, along with her friends and family and kill herself to be with a boy. The most interesting scene in the whole film is when Jacob and Edward finally sit down to talk one on one without Bella interrupting. Could this be a sign of maturity?",5,3,6,3 August 2011
Click," 'They Could Have Made It Really Funny, But Went With The Message At The End'
","Michael is an architect who works way too hard and can't seem to find time for his family. With too many remotes around the house he decides to pick up a universal remote to try and make his life a little easier. This is where he meets Morty, who works in the way beyond department. He gives Michael a remote that is 'beyond' it's time from a technical stand-point. Michael soon finds out that not only can it control the television, but the universe around him.Frank Coraci and Adam Sandler have worked together before; the results being The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer. Both films were quite funny and let Sandler do his usual yelling at everyone routine. Now they have hooked up for a third time and the result is 'Click', a not so overly funny film that tried to jump emotional gears left, right, and centre.While watching 'Click' all I could recall was how everyone cried in the final moments. I'm sitting here asking myself, why? Sure the scenes do tug at your tear ducts, but in this type of film you know exactly what the ending is going to be and guess what, that ending happens. If you know in the end everything is going to be okay, where is the emotional value in that? Sure I felt sad that he couldn't say good-bye to his father and sure I felt sad when he was lying there on the ground dying, but I didn't cry. I don't see where all these tears are coming from. Either I'm missing something, or the audience is just more emotional these days.In a film that has dogs humping ducks, an obese sandler groping his 'tits', and flatulence jokes you can't really have the sappy ending this film does. I don't buy it. 'Click' needed to stay in one frame of mind and not waver back and forth and teach us a lesson at the end of it. Numerous times I was reminded of Bruce Almighty here, it's basically the same film but one features a remote control. Both films showcase a dog with problems, a hot wife and a comedic actor being able to control everything around him. The difference is Bruce Almighty had so much more fun with what it had. Ask yourself what is funnier, Jim Carrey making Steve Carell look like an idiot on television, or Adam Sandler farting in David Hasselhoff's face? For the record, a dog humping a duck is only funny once, not a dozen times.It takes a special guy to save a film like this, and luckily for the filmmakers Walken is that man. Christopher Walken steals the show as Morty, the guy who gives Sandler the remote. In every scene that he's in, he has this comedic tone to him that just gets to you, and you can't explain it. As for Kate Beckinsale, sure she is hot and sure she can play the wife role, but did she really do that much? Nope, instead she decides to run off with Sean Astin...speaking of which, is he going to be the next Adam Sandler Cameo Buddy?I can only recommend this as a rainy day viewing. It's not the best, or the worst Sandler film. It does have some funny moments, Henry Winkler is perfect in the dad role and of course my main man Walken steals every scene he is in. You may even cry at the end, apparently, that's what I've been hearing. In the end, you most likely will end up disappointed with the fact that they didn't really do much with what they had. So much potential in the concept of a universal remote and it's wasted on Sandler's selfish doings. Instead of going outside the box and making a crazy flick, it plays it safe and does exactly what was shown in the trailers. On a side note, if you've seen the trailers, you've seen most of, if not all, of the comedic parts. So enjoy the film as much as you can. My final grade is a 6...and that's being generous.",6,1,3,20 December 2006
Sin City," 'Sin City Joins Die Hard and Fight Club As One Of The Ultimate Guy Flicks'
","Sin City tells three different stories, one which involves a dead hooker and a big thug. The other is filled with hookers left right and centre, a bad cop and one super cool dude. The Last story centres around a yellow bastard and a young hot stripper. These stories all take place in Basin City from the creative mind that is Frank Miller.Sin City had a trailer that I could watch over and over and never get bored of it. The film is the exact same way, only it's 10 times more fun. Sin City is based on the graphics novels by Frank Miller of the same name. Other then the fact that one is a book and the other is film, with some more bits of colour here and there, they are basically the exact same thing. Sin City joins Die Hard and Fight Club as one of the ultimate guy flicks and manages to become the best film of 2005.Robert Rodriguez makes great films, see From Dusk Till Dawn and Desperado, but every now and again he misses a step, Spy Kids 3-D and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl. Here he makes his best film yet, mixing in great visuals, incredible music, the perfect cast and one hell of a good time. Everything fits perfectly for Sin City and it never misses a beat. With Rodriguez behind the camera and Miller by his side for more creative input, Sin City not only becomes the best film of 2005, but one that will go down in history.Each story is unique for it's own merits and makes you want to re watch it over and over again. 'The Hard Good-Bye' and 'The Big Fat Kill' stand out over 'The Yellow Bastard' simply because they contain more action and move along quicker. That is why I can't give Sin City a perfect ten, The final act, which should go out with a bang, goes out on a depressing soft whimper. It does shock the viewer if they are not familiar with the work it is based on.What makes Sin City stand out from the rest of the films that came out in 2005? Well, aside from it's amazing visuals, it has the perfect cast. Mickey Rourke is back and is back big, with a bang, however you want to put it. Rourke got seriously overlooked by every award show, he became what he was suppose to become, right down to his chin. Del Toro shines in his role as Jackie Boy. Even the smallest bit of make-up that will make the role more believable helps and Del Toro knew this and wanted to make it as perfect as possible, he pulls it off. Clive Owen is super cool, as he is in almost everything he does. He just emulates it, although it does help that DWIGHT is super cool as well. They blend well together. It took me awhile to get passed Bruce Willis because everything I see him in, I don't see the character, I see Bruce Willis. He manages to pull it off, although it may take time to get use to him. The supporting cast help flesh out the film even more. Seeing a familiar face here and there is a treat for the audience.The films character were great, from the big brooding Marv, to the small agile and creepy Kevin. These comic book characters are brought to life by these actors and only in a world as imaginative as Sin City could these character exist and here they kick ass to the next level. Rodriguez creates his own environment and world for that matter. Much like Jackson did with the Lord of the Rings, and Lucas did with Star Wars. Rodriguez brings paper to screen and has made a world in which we will definitely see more stories evolve from.The music is beautiful. Rodriguez has an ear for music and uses it to it's full potential here. From the theme music that everyone loves to hear and gets excited about when they hear it, to the opening score. It fits the genre well. The visuals were interesting to see. The entire film was shot on digital, so the crisp look of the black and white is even more crisp then you would think. With dabs of colour here and there, Sin City catches the eye and makes the viewer glued to the screen.City is not for the faint of heart and is not exactly the first choice for date movie. The film contains some pretty graphic scenes, like decapitations, castrations, electrocution, explosions, stabbings, gun shots wounds, axe wounds, dog eating man wounds,and everything else. The bullet, the babes and the blood comes everywhere in here and if you enjoy this thing, as I do, then this is a film that you will definitely want to check out. Sin City has balls and it's not afraid of what it wants to show it's viewer.",9,1,2,6 April 2006
Saboteur," His Lesser Known Films Are Still Enjoyable.
","This is the second Hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock film I've seen in full, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas Rope took place all in one room. I didn't enjoy this one as much as Rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. As a thriller, I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. The sound design is almost non existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. Intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.The film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.The performances are there, but nothing amazing. Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. The one stand out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.In the end, I wanted more from this one. I understand it's one of Hitchcock's least exciting films, but I did have a good time watching it. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.",7,1,1,20 July 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," I FREAKING LOVED this movie!!!!
","The Cabin in the Woods is a spin on the horror genre from writer's Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, without giving away the spoilerish parts of the plot, I'll simply say that it involves 5 friends who fit the horror movie stereotypes (Jock, Slut, Party-Guy, Nerd, Virgin) who go to a cabin in the woods to party and get away from it all. Trouble is, its never really safe to go to a cabin in the woods is it?To be honest, the less you know about this film, the more awesome it will be. I felt that the trailer gave away a bit too much of the twists and turns one can expect from the film, but at the same time the image of a bird flying into a giant forcefield is what will set this film apart from the generic horror films that hit the theatres today. The Cabin In The Woods tells you upfront 'You think you know the story...' but of course you don't. This is Joss Whedon after all. Fans of Buffy and Angel will get a kick out of this, as actors from that universe make their way into this film.It's been a long time since I've had a lot of fun at the movies and the Cabin in the Woods was a lot of fun. It's an odd movie to sell, because a lot of it has to be kept secret to make the second half of the movie exciting and fresh. It blends a few genres together, the two main ones being horror and comedy and it works perfectly. Both Whedon and Goddard worked on Buffy and Angel, which was a balancing act of genres, so they knew the right tone to get here and they nailed it. They take the clich√©d aspects of every horror film and put it in here, to brilliant use. We actually get to see reasons for stupid character mistakes, which made that whole aspect of the film fun. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford have great chemistry together and stole every scene they're in. I would love to see these two character actors work together again, they made this film really fun and they are a joy to watch on the screen. The young actors, including Thor himself Chris Hemsworth, sell the clich√©d horror characters very well. In most horror flicks I can't stand any of the characters, here I was rooting for all of them.There are some truly hilarious moments, I am dying to talk about them, but doing so would ruin the surprises. All I can say is that I was laughing throughout the entire film, I cheered, I clapped and I enjoyed myself. There are a lot of horror references, most notably The Evil Dead, so it's fun to spot things here and there. Horror fans I think will really get a kick of of this flick and I pray it does well, cause it's the most fun I've had in a long time. Drew Goddard's first directorial gig, he had a lot on his plate and he managed to pull off one hell of a film. It helps when you have someone like Joss Whedon in your corner, but I applaud him for being able to pull off the tone perfectly, I imagine the script to screen process was identical. This is a very clever script, with laughs, gore and surprises at every corner. When you have Goddard, whose worked on Buffy, Angel, Lost and wrote Cloverfield, teamed up with partner Joss Whedon who is one of the best writers working today, then you know you're walking into something special. I can't recommend this flick enough. When it comes out, you must go see it. Just makes sure you don't know much about it beforehand, or it might ruin the awesome factor.",9,618,1055,15 March 2012
Moon," Bridges classic and modern ways of filmmaking.
","I've been trying to see this little film for awhile now. Now that I've actually seen it I can say that it did not disappoint. The one problem going into it though, I already knew the 'surprise' that was in it. Although I can say that I was surprised it came at the end of act 1.Moon has many themes playing around. Long distance relationship, big business corporations taking advantage of the little guy, discovery about one's self, etc. Moon was able to jam pack so many things in a little run time and it never felt like it dragged on. In fact I was surprised that it was near the end of the film, it feels incredibly short because of how involved I was with such a minimalist story. Rockwell does a tremendous job in dual roles. He plays the one part in a cocky, self assurance way, while the second feels more characterized and on edge. Two varied performances from one person in one film. He carries the entire film on his back and he did a great job. It's hard not to compare GERTY to Hal, they share so many similar things, yet they effectively made it different enough to be slightly original. The machine is voiced by Kevin Spacey, it a warm, yet still cold and machine like calmness. The use of both miniatures and CGI was a wise choice. You can notice that they are miniatures, but it works for this type of film because that it what they drew their inspiration from. Films in the sci/fi genre that used miniatures, and it works well here. The film bridges both old school and modern ways of filmmaking. Duncan Jones is a filmmaker to look out for, I expect great things in his career and look forward to his third film.",8,2,5,8 May 2011
Her," Her - Expression of the Soul
","A man struggling with connecting to woman as a result of a recent divorce decides to get an Operating System that manages to be self aware, intuitive and lovely. He falls in love with Samantha, as she calls herself. But can a human have a real relationship with an operating system?I loved being in this world. Jonze creates an incredible world in which he depicts a future that seems not too far away. Bright colours and fashion from our history, such as high waist pants, blends awkwardly well with the advancement of technology showcased here. Not once did I ever think that in our near, or distant future, that we would not achieve what Jonze envisions here.All of Jonze's films are high concept, Being John Malkovich, Where The Wild Thing Are, etc...you'll see a lot of melancholy. Her fits well with his resume, but comes off as a more mature and held back piece. I was invested in the characters, more so than any other film this year. Hell, Her depicts the most honest and real relationship this year and one of them is nothing but ones and zeros. Both characters here are yearning for something more, Theodore, played by Phoenix yearns for connection. He needs to be with someone, but can't emotionally because he still wants to be with his wife. Samantha, voiced by Scar-Jo, yearns to be more than an operating system. She wants to feel, learn, be alive. This film mirrors what these characters go through, which is self discovery. The film doesn't look at the technology as our saviour, nor does it look at it as our curse. It's simply part of our lives and the use of this allows us to examine relationships in a slightly new way. We are disconnected from people due to our devices, but we feel more connected with people because of them. The film manages to make the viewer wrestle with the question, what makes us human? Especially with an AI character and having so many people in the film walk around, in a zombie state, connected to their highly advanced devices. All the people Theodore sees in one way or another mirror him. They all have their ear pieces in, connecting with technology. Phoenix is marvellous here. I'm not a huge fan of him, but I simply loved his performance here. I believed everything he did here and I think it had to do with his eyes. He invokes such sympathy with just his eyes, that Phoenix the actor disappears and Theodore the awkwardly emotionally detached AI lover emerges. He tries to fill his void of loneliness with the technology, as do most of the characters depicted in the film. Amy Adams shows up as a neighbour to Phoenix and best friend. She's here to showcase to us that he is able to talk to and connect with a human being, he's not necessarily this recluse. This is a nice counter to the technology aspect. There is a brother-sister relationship here, which was crucial for the film. This helps us to see the technology as more of a tool for the characters, than simply a good or bad aspect of our future. Her is heartfelt, funny and depressing. If your asking yourself, can a human and an OS have sex? Her answers this question, in a unique way that lets us focus on the sound and not the visuals. Her is without a doubt extremely inventive in the way it approached and handled the typical generic genre about romance and relationships. Her is one of the best films of the year and I highly recommend it.",8,1,3,7 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Silly Mistakes Took Me Out Of The Experience
","Slumdog Millionaire is a love story, about the troubles one young man goes through in order to be with the woman he loves. Jamal is a contestant on the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, and is interrogated after answering all the correct answers, he explains how he knew those answers and we are taken on a ride through his life and through India.This film is marvelous to watch, from the opening shots of India and the hyper kinetic chase through the slums, I was immediately captured by the beauty this film offers its viewer. Both beautiful and depressing, violent and peaceful, dangerous and safe. Slumdog rises to be one of the better films of 2008 and was so close to being a top contender, but faults with the film are technical and it immediately took me out of that zone of beauty and made me realize I was watching a movie.I'll get to that later, but first, let me tell you how good the film is. It's really good. The vibrant colours hit you and never leave, you actually feel like you are in another world. The sound design is immense and astounding, great attention to detail that is backed with a joyful soundtrack.The cast is wonderful, Freida Pinto is beautiful beyond words, playing the love interests of the main character in the present time. Each character (Jamal, his brother Salim and Litika) are portrayed at different stages in their lives, by different actors. I enjoyed the really young child actors the most, their innocence and voice worked so well. Dev Petal plays Jamal on the show and despite being new to the acting craft, feels comfortable in the role. One would not know that the kid is actually British.The film is an all around feel good flick, you will cheer for the kids and their adventures. I will admit, when I first heard about it and saw a trailer I was not really interested, the India background turned me off. I didn't think it was going to be an endearing and thought provoking film. First mistake ladies and gentlemen is going into a flick with preconceived notions. Of course after hearing all the praise I decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did.Now on to my own little personal rant as I said earlier. I was taken out of the movie experiences a couple times and it ultimately ruined bits for me. One would be after the show is turned on the television and Jamal is being questioned we see a boom mic over his head. Bobbing away up in the air, the second is when we see Latika for the first time after she was captured. The continuity with her piercings in her nose were totally off. Normally the continuity thing wouldn't bother me if it weren't so apparent, but the boom mic really did take me out of it. Or what about the fact that these kids speak English when they are older. Where the hell did they learn that?That said, the film does have some minor flaws, it's not perfect in anyway. I wanted a bit more from Latika, she was under used. The millionaire questions were incredibly easy, I could be a millionaire right now. you'll enjoy the flashbacks more then the present, but I'm assuming you're suppose to. All in all, Slumdog is a good film.",8,0,3,1 February 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Buckle Up For The Most Intense Film This Year!!!
","Max has been captured and is being used as a human blood-bag when he is dragged along into a desert chase, to recapture women on the run with the one armed Furiosa.I, like many, was blown away by the trailer of Mad Max: Fury Road. The chaotic zen of action symphony was something I made sure I wasn't going to miss when it hit theatres. Tom Hardy fills the role of Max, originally played by Mel Gibson. We get very little in terms of story and character development from him. The little we do get is in glimpses of a flashback that seems to haunt him. Someone or some people, he couldn't save from the horrors of this post- apocalyptic landscape. Despite the film barring his name for the title, it seems that Charlize Theron's Furiosa is more of a lead here. The one armed soldier has just as much, if not more screen time than Hardy. This is Theron's film, no doubt and she steals the show from Hardy. Rounding out the rest of the cast is Nicholas Hoult, AKA Beast from the recent X-Men films, as one sick puppy determined to serve the antagonist till the day he dies. He's the demented one using Max as a blood-bag. He serves Immortan Joe, played by original Mad MAx baddie Hugh Keays-Byrne. He's a twisted villain who looks the part. Everyone looks the part, that's where this film excels at. The costume and make-up design for this film is astounding. I hope it receives some sort of recognition come awards season time. Where else does this film excel at? Why the action of course. The choreography in this film is astounding. Miller has raised the bar here. I never once lost my place in the action. Miller always had something new up his sleeve and just when our heroes felt that they dealt with something, here comes something new. This two hour car chase was never dull, never repetitive and always on-point. I had a big goofy smile on my face the entire time. Right from the chaotic beginning to the climatic end. That's what I loved about this film, it doesn't take time to explain things to you with exposition. It immediately plunges you down into their world and dares you to keep up with it. Mad Max is bold, thrilling, exciting, chaotic and so much damn fun. People want to complain about zero characterization. I beg to differ. The film gave just enough characterization for me to care. A lot of this film is ambiguous. Why things are the way they are, who people are and their intentions. I like it that way. The film is all about being in the moment. As for this moment...I want to go see it again.",9,9,18,25 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Fear War.
","It's been over a decade since Mel Gibson has been in the director's chair. People have been anticipating his return for awhile now and this year he brings Hacksaw Ridge, a bloody tale about freedom and persecution.Doss enlists into the army in the hopes of becoming a medic. During his training he is asked to pick a rifle and shoot a target, he refuses. His faith and trust in God deters him from ever holding a gun to kill a man. This does not make him popular with the men who must fight by his side. So why does he want to enlist in the war? He wants to save people and save people he does. Doss' heroics lead him to saving about 75 wounded men during the battle of Hacksaw Ridge, an astonishing and miraculous feat. i walked away from the film with one thing on my mind. Thank God I never had to experience anything like that. Watching these characters go into battle, made me terrified for myself in that situation. Blindly firing across a barren wasteland, bodies scattered about the ground. Running directly into that gunfire....horrifying. No thank you. I don't have one tenth the courage those men had. Hacksaw Ridge is almost on the same savage and surreal level of the opening beach sequence from Saving Private Ryan. Some of the carnage is hard to watch as limbs are blown off, guts are falling out, people are set on fire. One particular sequence does seem to lean on the more ridiculous side, when an American soldier grabs the torso of a dead Japanese solider and uses it as a shield, as he runs through the battlefield. Some arguments are made that Gibson tends to favour the bloody violence and revel in it. I can see 'some' aspects of this (the aforementioned torso bit) but speak to people that were actually in war and they will tell you that it's pretty darn close to what happened. We don't have many people left who fought in these wars, so please, talk to those people. I wish I had spoken to my grandparents more often about their lives and their history. Andrew Garfield is Doss, our lead here. He plays there role with a little bit of a Forrest Gump edge. He's innocent, plays dumb a little bit, but always seems to get the job done. He gets the girl, the respect of his allies and superiors and more. Yes, the road there was not an easy one and this is indeed a true story, but I felt the parallels there. He does a decent enough job, but nothing to really cheer about. I was more engaged with Vince Vaughn oddly enough. He does very well here in a non-comedic role. Hopefully he ventures in more dramatic roles in the near future. I feel people underestimate his dramatic roles and once he hit a streak with his comedy films he never seemed interested in going elsewhere. I hope this changes his mind. The film can be broken down into three parts. Doss' life pre-war, Doss' life training for war and of course the actual war itself. The pre-war segment might be a tad slow for some, but everything Gibson shows us is perfectly arranged for the story and the character arcs. The film is really preachy as well, maybe a little too preachy. I understand that religion is the backbone to the story and the reason why we have a tale as astonishing as this, but with Gibson behind the camera, I felt like he upped it a tad. The juxtaposition of the peace belief by Doss with the violence of the war is a tough one to wrestle with. Hacksaw Ridge is a great film from Gibson and I hope to see it get some recognition come awards season.",8,3,8,3 January 2017
Warcraft," 'Our hope is destroyed; there is nothing to go back to.'
","I feel conflicted over this film because I want to like it, I want it to be successful and I believe the world created in the film can obviously be expanded upon and offer some truly great cinematic experiences. Duncan Jones, who gave us the brilliant Moon and exciting Source Code is behind the camera and brings a wonderful visual style, but as is the case with a lot of big budget CGI filled epic flicks, the visual style is not enough.The Orc world is dying and they need to find another to live. Gul'dan unite the Orc clans together to become The Horde. He uses a magical power known as The Fel to create a portal to another world, Azeroth. The portal needs life to be sacrificed in order to work so thousands of people are captured in Azeroth in an attempt to bring even more of The Horde over to conquer the lands. Sir Anduin Lothar, a military commander leads the humans in a fight to protect their land. Along with their King, a magical being known as The Guardian and a mage in training, they need to stop the portal from being built before it's too late.As basic as the premise sounds (evil invading / good defending) the film throws a lot at you in quick successions. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel overwhelmed by it all. I've never played the games, so I'm sure I missed a lot of winks and nods and of course my enjoyment of it might be on the lesser side of things, but Warcraft is exciting in many sequences. Those exciting sequences astonish the eyes with dazzlingly effects. I doubt we'll see anything that looks better this year, the Orcs feel alive. In particular Durotan, an Orc that believes his leader Gul'dan is doing more damage than good. He is the one Orc that is given something that resembles a backstory. His wife gives birth early in the film and I can only assume that the child goes on to become someone important in the game franchise. On the human side, Lothar is the character that Jones decides to focus on. He's a soldier, that's all he knows. He's even brought his son up to be soldier. His two duties in life are to protect his son and protect the King. With the invading armies of the Horde, his skills and loyalty are put to the test. The King, basically does what a King does, order people to do this, order people to do that. We get little interaction with a more humanistic side to him. Magic is also a big portion of the film, with a man known as The Guardian who holds what seems to be unlimited power and a Mage, who is still learning his spells. They fill their basic fantasy roles, but I can't help but feel that Ben Foster, who plays the Guardian, is miscast. Maybe it's his age, but I simply did not believe him in this film at all. Warcraft is full on fantasy. Giant birds, magical beings, kingdoms and castles. For those not interested in those things, Warcraft will not convert you. In fact it will make you feel more alienated. What it does do, for me at least, is be interested in the possibility of a sequel. The film throws a few surprises at you and does a lot of set-up for those future instalments, which might not even come. As it stands, Warcraft is a film to watch on a big screen, in high definition. I totally understand why the critics hate it, why the fans love it and why I'm somewhere in the middle.",7,2,3,15 June 2016
The Breakfast Club," Ultimate Teenager Flick?
","A group of kids are sent to detention on a Saturday for various reasons. They are all different, from the nerd, the jock, the rebel, the princess and the weirdo. These kids manage to find out things about each other and themselves while serving detention. Even though I was born in 1987, two years after the film was released, I can relate to it. That's what makes The Breakfast Club so damn good, kids generations later can still relate to the characters and their problems. John Hughes is the one person in the film industry who got what teenagers desired, were scared of and felt. The man was/is a legend and the 80's belonged to him. The Breakfast Club is one of my favourites from him. Planes, Trains and Automobiles still takes the top spot, but The Breakfast Club has more of an emotional connection to the viewer. The cast, also known as the Brat Pack, do a wonderful job filling in their high school clich√É¬©d roles. Emilio Estevez , the mighty duck man I swear to god, plays the jock. He has an intense and emotional scene that felt like an anthem for millions of teens going through the same problems. The same goes for the other characters, all have problems in their lives that every other teenager can relate to. Whether it's Judd Nelson and his abusive father or Michael Anthony Hall and the pressure to do well in school. Paul Gleason is wonderfully evil as the principal who seems to have a hate for these kids. His speeches are great to listen to and he nails the role. His performance is my favourite the in the film. Look out for that John Hughes cameo at the end as the kids are picked up from detention. That's a little something extra for you folks at home that dig that kind of stuff.The music rocks, the theme is still played today and is immediately associated with the film. There are many memorable scenes, too many to mention and the overall feel of the film has numerous re-watch capabilities. When people think of John Hughes, the one film I think that they will immediately go to is The Breakfast Club. Not only was it the film the teenagers of the 80's could relate to, but it's a film that will live on and touch the hearts of many others. It's funny, depressing and emotionally challenges you. It doesn't treat you like an idiot, Hughes knew his audience and treated the kids with the intelligence he knew they had.",8,2,3,5 June 2010
The Social Network," A Solid Win For All Involved.
","Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend in the opening scene and in a drunken rage he goes online and hacks into different websites to take student photos and create a site called FaceMash, where people pick which girl is hotter. This leads to some academic probation, but it catches the eyes of three other students who want to create a social networking site that would be exclusive to Harvard students. They tell Zuckerberg the idea and he joins the team. Unfortunately Zuckerberg shuts them off from communication and writes his own codes and brings in his best friend as CFO. Thus The Facebook is born. As the site gets more popular, Zuckerberg loses his connection with his best friend and ends up getting sued by him and the three students for millions of dollars.When I first heard that there was going to be a movie based on Facebook, I rolled my eyes and asked why even bother. Then, to my surprise, I heard that David Fincher was set to direct. My interest perked up a little bit, after all the guy directs some stellar films. It wasn't until the trailers starting popping up did I really want to see this film. The accolades that it has been receiving added more anticipation. Now that I've seen the film, all I can say is bravo. Fincher and soon to be nominated for best adapted screenplay Aaron Sorkin, have created a film that defines what this generation is all about. Facebook is such a cultural impact that some people can't live their lives without it. I have it open in another window as I'm writing this review right now. The film will undoubtedly receive more award nominations than screenplay, I'm just curious to see if any of those are in the acting department because this cast is great.Jesse Eisenberg, who people always claimed to be a Michael Cera rip off, commands the screen with his awkward and pseudo intelligent riffs in his speeding bullet laced monologues. The guy (Zuckerberg) is brilliant at code writing, but his social skills are clearly lacking. His best friend, Eduardo Saverin (soon to be Spiderman Andrew Garfield) is desperate to get into elite clubs and has his emotions close to the surface. Eventually they explode when he learns he's being shifted out of his CFO position. Garfield plays well opposite Eisenberg. To my surprise Justin Timberlake wasn't irritating. He plays egocentric Sean Parker and while I don't see any awards heading his way, he does help complete a well put together cast.The story jumps between two timelines. The present, in which Zuckerberg is facing two lawsuits and the past, which we see the creation of facebook. Heaps of praise should be thrown on Fincher and Sorkin, they pulled off this structure perfectly. The film feels just like his previous efforts, dark and cold. Much like the depiction of Zuckerberg. I can't comment on how true the film depicts the events, but we all know he did get sued and the filmmakers stand by the truths they tell in this film. It's all heightened to be entertaining, but with Zuckerberg trying to steer clear, I see a lot of truth in this film.The Social Network is one of the years best films. It's solid direction from Fincher, who knows what he wants from every aspect. Sorkin delivers a timeless story set in our age of the internet and facebook. Friendship, greed and loyalty are all called into question. The performance are strong across the board with such a young cast. Eisenberg standing out in the lead role of Zuckerberg. The score is phenomenal, Fincher knew what he wanted and he got it with Trent Reznor. His style of music perfectly matches the film with the technology it's bringing to the forefront. I wouldn't call this the film of the decade, but it is good enough to be in the high ranks of Fincher's best work and one of the best works this year. For a film that is simply people talking, it feels natural and goes at a breakneck speed. I highly recommend The Social Network.",9,3,7,2 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," Hollow, But Fancy Enough For The Eyes.
","Nick Carraway moves next to an eccentric millionaire, Mr. Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties every single night. One night he receives an invitation to the party, the only invitation Gatsby has ever given to anyone to attend his gathering. Who is this Mr. Gatsby, why does he throw lavish parties every night and what are his real intentions? I read the book in preparation for this film, something I rarely do. I was left underwhelmed by the book and overexposed by the film. While the Baz Luhrmann does stay faithful to the words on the page, the overall tone and feel of the picture seems to be in the wrong place. When the truth about the book is about the falseness of these rich people and their empty lives while using the pedestal of a love story to get through it, Luhrmann seems more interested, or maybe the studio was, at making the love story front and centre, almost ignoring the more interesting aspects of the tale. What is left is an hollow film, that is fancy for the eyes and not much more.I chose to see the in 2D and judging by what I saw, I don't think I would have missed the confetti and floating typewriter words coming at me very much. Luhrmann's films always look like the prettiest girl at the ball. Gatsby is probably the prettiest of them all and with good reason too. Those parties Gatsby throws is wonderful, full of energy, vibrant colours and dance numbers. It's at one of these parties that we are introduced to Gatsby, in one of the most over the top and perfect character introductions I've seen on film. DiCaprio captures the essence of Gatsby, a lonely insecure man who hides behind his riches and puts on this mysterious front. He looks the part, acts the part and is one of the highlights of the picture. No one else seems to be on the same page as him though. Joel Edgerton is Tom Buchanan, a brutish fellow who is having an affair. Edgerton chomps on his cigars, kisses his woman and loves to poke the fire when it is hot. His wife, Daisy, played by the timid as a mouse Carey Mulligan is the picturesque woman that Gatsby is pining for. She doesn't seem to have a real identity. She is torn between two men, but nothing else of her character wants to come though. Her cousin, Nick Carraway is played by Peter Parker himself, Tobey Maguire. Much like the book, he is give nothing to do but walk around in the background with a drink in his hand. Maguire takes this thankless role and adds no flare, no emotion, no sense of tragedy to it. Aside from Pleasantville, I've yet to see a good Tobey Maguire performance. The story is a tragic one and even if Luhrmann didn't want to focus on the rich and famous and just centre on this love story, he should have added more stakes into it. Character with little to no screen time early on in the film, play major roles later on. It's an odd balance, made even odder by the Luhrmann flare he puts in it. The film feels like Moulin Rouge, with the over exaggerated expressions and acting from the background characters. The choice of modern music in an old time era, Luhrmann even uses the same plot device with a man telling the story at a typewriter. But like I said, the film look gorgeous, sounds great and is very eccentric, much like the characters that inhabit this story. This is probably the closest adaptation of The Great Gatsby we'll get, even if it didn't get it right.",6,0,1,15 May 2013
The Proposal," If it had ended differently, I would have liked it more.
","After she is discovered as being a Canadian without a working visa, this bossy she devil of a woman black mails her young assistant into marrying her so she can stay in the U.S. Hilarity would then ensue as they try to fake this engagement to his family.This rom-com did pretty well at the box office, I'd have to say that it is because of the comedic chemistry of the two main stars. Both Reynolds and Bullock do very well in the film and since they are actual friends in real life, their comedic timing is great when they work off one another. The film is set up nicely and it works until the obvious romantic comedy ending comes into play. It's almost as if there is an unspoken rule that must be followed, every romantic comedy must end the same way. I was praying for this one to throw the audience a curveball, but that never came. I find it harder and harder to enjoy films like this where you can map out every single plot point and turn in the film.The supporting cast really held the film together for the most part. Betty White steals every scene she is in,. Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson are Reynolds parents, they fit their roles nicely, but could have been used a bit more. Steenburgen is playing a nicer version of what she did in Step Brothers and Nelson is playing a meaner version of what he did in The Family Stone. These two talents are used nearly enough in this film. I'm still wondering what the purpose of having Malin Akerman in the film was, her character seemed to be complete filler and after seeing this film people may never look at Oscar from the Office the same ever again.The film hits every romantic comedy clich√© it possibly can, everyone it hit I died a little bit inside. I wanted this one to be different. Of course they start off not liking each other, of course while they fake it they unknowingly start liking each other, of course she feels bad at the end for doing what she is doing, of course their plan backfires and everyone finds out, of course there is a mad chase to get the girl before it's too late, of course he professes his love for her that they think is real and of course the audience begin rolling their eyes. Spoilers? I don't know, it seemed pretty obvious from the beginning. Can I fault it for following the same formula that every film before it does? Yes, of course I can.I suppose to you are into those films, ones that you know exactly what is going to happen but seem to love it anyway, then the Proposal is for you. It's a film for those people that don't care what happens and just want to laugh at the awkward moments the characters are put in, such as naked to naked colliding and eagle stealing dog scenes. Reynolds has done his fare share of romantic comedy films and needs to go into another direction. He has talent, he needs to start using them for different material.",5,1,1,8 April 2010
Shark Tale," Big Name Stars Don't Make The Film Any Better.
","A mafia film of sorts, set underwater and with fish. Will Smith is Oscar, a fish that lies about killing a shark. The shark was actually killed by a dropped anchor, yet Oscar was at the scene and is now known as the Sharkslayer. Mob Boss Robert DeNiro hears about his son's death and takes matters into his own hands, this doesn't bode well for Oscar.Shark Tale at first glance seems to be a mere rip off of Finding Nemo. The Pixar film that had fish as their main characters was charming, funny and adventurous. It's not fair to compare the two, since this film lacks all of those ingredients. Shark Tale instead relies on pop-culture references to get the adults smirking and the bright colourful fish to get the kids wanting the toys. The story, the animation and the fun are all below the bar. With every film that is released by Dreamworks, the inevitable will happen. People will compare it to Pixar. Pixar is simply in another league, they seem to care about their stories and characters and not just having a bunch of people cash in on the current craze. Shark Tale has an impressive cast, if this were a live action dramatic film, starring Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro and was directed by Scoresese, then we might have a masterpiece on our hands. Alas, the actors of this world think that just because they lend their voice to an animated character, that their job is half done for them. Jack Black works in this film, even DeNiro, who plays up on his past roles. Jolie, Zellweger and Smith do not. They have nothing to add to the film that some nameless actress/actor could have done. There is no sense of adventure. We are trapped under the sea instead of exploring the depths of this world. It was interesting to see the fish life here, but I'm sure we've all seen creative takes on modern life in a film that has an odd setting, The Flinstones is famous for this. I still hear people talking about Finding Nemo today, hell even older animated films like Toy Story, but Shark Tale seemed to have faded the next day after the release. It's not memorable to kids, nor will adults find any real charm or wit. The film tries to hard with a lot of the jokes and references that it becomes tiresome. Shark Tale fails because it would rather have big name stars on the poster, than a tangible and interesting story. I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, what matters most in a film is the story. Sure, it can be done before, but as long as the story teller and the story telling is good and has my interest, I'm game. Shark Tale did none of this and it felt lazy, much like the cast.",4,3,6,4 June 2010
Jurassic Park," Classic Filmmaking And Entertainment.
","what? Dinosaurs are cloned and are running amok in an amusement park? Well, that can't be good. Something must go wrong. Well, something does go wrong, thanks a lot Newman. Know the guests who are at the park before it opens to the public are fresh meat for the so called extinct species. Spielberg in his hey day, cranking out a film that defined a generation and changed the way special effects are used in films. Jurassic Park is a nail biting, amazement that dazzles and makes you smile with glee. If Superman made you believe a man can fly, then Jurassic Park made you believe we can re-create dinosaurs. Never before have dinosaurs looked so life like and realistic on the screen. Say whatever you want about the special effects today, I still like them, in 1993 it gave audiences and Hollywood something to gawk at.Three doctors are invited to the preview tour of the park. Sam Neil, Laura Dern and of course the one guy you want to play a doctor/scientist, Jeff Glodblum. While on the tour, a major storm hits and the power goes down. It doesn't help that Wayne Knight is trying to steal the embryos to make some ca-ching. Well, those dinosaurs who eat meat eventually escape and we are in for a thrilling ride. Our first introduction to the T-REX stands as one of the best introductions and visual film achievements to this day. The cast do well together and the kids aren't AS ANNOYING as they use to be. They still make me grind my teeth though. As a kid, this film was all about the raptor chase sequence. Others seemed to like everything with the T-REX. Either or, every scene that has a dinosaurs is indeed spectacular. A giant leap forward in filmmaking, from a technical standpoint. A great theme song to tie things up and we have ourself a blockbuster film that doesn't disappoint on repeat viewings. It is still today, as good as it was back in the day. It might seem a bit dated when our little heroine decides to use the computer and we see how freaking basic everything is, but Jurassic Park is a flick that should be seen by everyone looking for a good time at the movies.",8,1,2,13 August 2010
The Simpsons Movie," Fresh, Ambitious & Really Funny, The Simpsons Score On The Big Screen
","Homer dumps some 'waste' into a nearby lake in Springfield, causing the EPA to take dramatic matters. The decision is made to enclose the city in a dome, thus making Homer public enemy number one.From 180ft paintings in the grass next to sacred images, to 7/11 turning itself into a Kwik-E-Marts and numerous TV spots on the fox network, it was no surprise that almost everyone on earth knew there about The Simpsons Movie. The longest running show on television, 18 years later is finally hitting the big screen. To say it was hyped would be an understatement. Can a show that has been falling down the ladder in quality and viewers make the jump to the big screen? Well, with 11 writers, all from the good days of The Simpsons, it's safe to say that they hit this one out of the park.While they tried their best to keep the plot of the film under wraps before its release, the basic plot of the film was known to be before I saw the film. It did ruin a few surprises and jokes, but not the overall experience. Like Homer says in the opening bit of the film, why pay for something when you can see it for free on the television. Well, this movie is the answer to that. It pushes the envelope further, which is a luxury the creators have in the film world that they do not have in TV land. Where shows like Family guy appeared on TV and garnered big success, it seemed The Simpsons was losing a battle it was always winning. Now after it's big screen debut, The Simpsons, I'm hoping, is back on track to being the show it once was. What Family Guy failed to do with it's 'film', which felt like 3 episodes edited together, The Simpsons does wonderfully. The animation is crisp and up-to-date. Seeing this film did not make me miss the flowing hair on certain chef rats or big green ogres. While we have seen Homer in '3-D' it simply would not have worked here and I'm glad they stuck with the traditional animation. For fans of the show, it's always fun finding those inside jokes scattered throughout the film, such as Homer finally making the jump over the gorge, a feat he failed to do in 'Bart The Daredevil' and the ambulance that is still crashed at the edge of the gorge. Aside from show references, there are hundreds upon hundreds of film references, which include: Titanic, Star Wars, Spider-man, An Inconvenient Truth and many, many more.The film is definitely for all ages, both adults and kids, who are fans of the show, will find this film entertaining. While in the theatre the laughter was unison with young and old. The good thing is, you don't really have to be a fan of the show to get the jokes. There is enough comedy in this film for both parties. It does help if you know the history of some of the characters, such as Millhouse's lust for Lisa, and the cold heart of Mr. Burns. There are also some new characters introduced, whether or not we see them recurring in the show is another story. The voice acting is on the spot here, which is what would be expected from the people who've been these characters for almost two decades. As with many episodes, there are celebrity guest voices, but I can't really say who lends their voice without giving away the joke/surprise that it's meant to be. Yes, this does feel like a Simpsons episode stretch to 90 minutes, but that is a good thing. Crafting a film from a series that has been on the air for nearly two decades is a risky thing, but they pulled it off. The film is oozing of the first few seasons of the show, which are the best, but it's also fresh and ambitious. Those 11 writers for the show, show us that they care about these characters and prove to us that they are still in good hands. Will the success of the film, spread back to the show? I hope so. And to answer Homer's question. Why pay for something when you can get it for free on TV. Well, because it's funny, that's why.",8,3,7,4 August 2007
The Fighter," The Fighter is a winner.
","The story of Micky 'Irish' Ward and his boxing career with his crack addicted brother at his side. Apparently Marky Mark was so hell bent on getting this film made that he stayed in 'shape' for years and years just in case the film went into production. That's dedication and passion for you, yet the man still manages to be the weak link. It's not really his fault, David O. Russell packed the film with a lot of talent. Christian Bale plays Dicky Ecklund, Micky's crack addicted brother who tells the same story over and over again, about him knocking out Sugar Ray Leonard. It's his claim to fame. There is a film crew following him around, he thinks it's going to be about his comeback, yet it's really about the harsh realities of crack addiction. Bale, again, submerses himself in the role. He is pure method. You can not like him as a person, or even an actor, but you can't deny his passion for the art. He is on the thin side again, with thin balding hair and brown teeth. He looks deathly ill in every scene. The man has one of his finest roles to date and will no doubt be nominated come award season. I hope he actually takes home the award. He is without a doubt, the most interesting character in the film. Their mother is played by Melissa Leo, another performance worthy of recognition come award season. Her desire to see her kids rise to fame blind her from the truth. She denies the drugs and the failures and believes she knows what's best for her kids. This means not letting them get a real chance because it would be with a real manager and she would be left behind. Family is important to her and she wants to keep everyone very close, even if it harms their chance at making a name for themselves. She of course, doesn't realize this. Amy Adams is the love interest, you know there had to be one. She manages to pull Micky away from the family that is dragging him down. They don't like her for it. She has her own inspirations too, yet the story isn't interested in them. The main focus of the film is with Micky's bumpy road to the championship fight. Since this is based on a true story, I can't really fault it for becoming a bit formulaic and predictable, yet it is. David O. Russell is notorious for getting angry and violent with his crew/cast. He was in a physical fight with George Clooney on the set of Three Kings and anyone can go on youtube and check out the melt down he and Lily Tomlin had on the set of I Heart Huckabees. Both films coincidentally star Mark Walhberg, so it seems he doesn't have a problem working with the combative director. I can't deny that the man has talent. I really love Three Kings and found I Heart Huckabees to be an ambitious project for the sheer weirdness of it all. With The Fighter, he plays to a more conventional audience. In terms of boxing films, it works. It plays on the down and out character, the poverty of his life and the sheer determination he has to make a name for himself. It's no Rocky, or as others have mentioned Raging Bull, but it is good enough to be mentioned with them.Russell always has an eye for a creative shot. Check out Three Kings colour scheme for what I mean. Here he uses TV cameras for the boxing matches. Interesting move, it feels like we are watching it at home and are not really in the ring with them. I admire directors who think outside of the box. Russell does this, no problem. He also decides to include real footage of the characters. The film has some home video segments throughout and during the credits we get to meet the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eckland, which is even more reason to appreciate Bale's performance. The film trips a bit because of the lack of emotion from Walhberg. I dig the guy and enjoy his films, but his range isn't there yet. When given a role that he can play the absurdity of, he scores. Watch The Departed for that. For a film where the audience needs to get behind a character, to root and cheer for them to overcome their obstacles, he falls a little short. Thank goodness the film makes up for this with the performances from Bale and Leo.The Fighter features great music, engaging performances and a predictable, yet true story. I felt attached to the characters and hoping they would make smart decisions. If a film can get me to care about the characters, I say bravo. The Fighter is a winner in my books.",8,82,95,23 December 2010
Evil Dead II," 'It Ups The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror'
","This movie is equal to the original Evil Dead, here we have ASH the lone survivor from the first encounter with the evil dead, fighting off the deadites yet again. ASH encounters some unexpected guests and now everyone must fight for the lives, or become the evil that hunts them.Sam Raimi does an excellent job of keeping us scared in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, with the dead surrounding us. When ASH is alone in the cabin, we are alone in the cabin and every creaking sound we hear feels like it's right beside us. The eery feeling is not as terrifying as the original, because the original was a punch in the face of terror. This one is more of a drench you in the face with blood, instead of a punch. The touch of dark comedy is great. ASH versus his hand is some comic gold and is a great way to give you some breathing room when you're not terrified of what might happen next.The script of course is just one guy in a cabin against the dead, but what makes it different is the great one-liners 'Swallow This', 'Groovy'. The movie showcases other characters that hold no emotional value to the viewer what so ever. You don't even feel sorry for the hillbilly who gets stabbed, slammed by the door, kicked, yelled at, while still being stabbed mind you, dragged and then finally something unknown happens to him under the cellar, but it involves gallons upon gallons of blood.The ending to this film sets up the third installment ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is a total turn around from the first two. The cameo of FREDDY'S glove is a classic nod to Craven's work...or a diss, however you look at it. The whole idea of an evil unknown force underneath you in a cellar is scary enough, not to mention the fact that we have to go down there with our hero, who's armed with trademark boomstick and chainsaw.This film holds one of my all time favourite scenes. Can you guess it, it's when Ash 'saws' off his own hand with a psycho laugh, while blood splatters across his face and his laugh slowly grows into agony and screaming. If you love blood, dark comedy, great directing, classic B movie acting, one-liners and want to be scared ****less, then check this movie out, as well as the original.This is what horror is all about, the gore, the atmosphere, the EVIL DEAD",10,37,47,26 September 2005
High Fidelity," You Smell That? That's Nostalgic
","Quick, if you could list your top 5 records, could you? I can't. John Cusack's character is asked the same question and he responds with, I'll make you a mix tape. In watching this film I can see how some people may see it and think that it is dated. I mean, records? Tape decks? Kids these days all have mp3 players, I'd be surprised if they even knew what a CD was. But these elements do not date this film, they enrich it, give it nostalgia.Don't be too quick to heap this film in with other so called music flicks like Empire Records, which is good in it's own right, but these are two different flicks. High Fidelity recounts the top 5 break-ups from Rob, who breaks the 4th wall to talk to the audience about those break-ups. He decides to go back and talk to these girls to see what went wrong and what does it all mean. Each segment sort of flies by before it even starts.I loved all the music chit chat, it seemed really natural and Tim Robbins cameo is absolutely hilarious. Both his sex and fight scenes steal the show. The film does tend to drag in places and cut be cut down 10 minutes or so, but it is definitely something you can watch more then once. I have a friend who says that this film speaks to him so much because he can see himself in the character. Another friend of mine says the same thing about Almost Famous. One day I will find one of these films that will speak to me....one day.",7,1,2,20 July 2009
Up in the Air," Jason Reitman Is Becoming One Of My Favourite Directors
","George Clooney is Ryan Bingham, a guy who has distant himself from family and friends. So much that he is a motivational speaker about only caring about things that really matter, or that can fit in your back pack. His job requires him to fly around the country firing people. Once this young hot shot girl comes along, she brings with her technology, a computer that makes it easier to fire people from the comfort of your own office. No more expensive flights for those guys like Bingham flying around firing people, this obviously causes a problem for him.I always thought that the success of Juno was more because of Reitman than Cody, yet she was the one who got all the accolades. Both Juno and Thank You For Smoking are hilarious films with heart and are competently directed from Reitman. Both contain dark humour and themes (smoking/teen pregnancy) and yet they never cross that line of bad taste. Up In The Air is a welcomed addition and it follows the success and hilarity of Reitman's previous two films. Up In The Air is not my favourite Reitman film, that would be Thank You For Smoking, but it's his most mature work and it shows us that if he is this good now, what he has to deliver in the future will be marvelous.Clooney is the lead, he has numerous plastic cards in his wallet for just about everything. Airlines, rental cars, hotel suits - he never throws them away, which comes back to hurt him when he has to try 3 or 4 of them before finding the right hotel room key. He meets Alex, played by Vera Farmiga, she is exactly like Ryan, the only difference between them, according to her, is that she has a vagina. Clooney belittles the new girl Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, who brings in new technology, but is inexperienced in the 'art' of firing people. Or in their words, letting people go so they can make an easier transition to another stage in their lives. Jason Bateman, who is Clooney's boss, forces him to take the new girl under his wing on some firing trips, before they install these new computers. It's not a sexual relationship at all, it's more of a mentor and student relationship. Clooney and Farmiga have a purely sexual relationship, until Clooney starts to fall for her and must re-evaluate his life.Along the way he must take a cardboard cutout of his sister and her fianc√©, you know 'like that French gnome movie', funny Am√©lie reference. Natalie begins challenging all of Ryan's beliefs in life. The chemistry between the two is not only funny, but it feels real. A father figure, for her when she needs to learn about life, in her job and relationships. The romance between Clooney and Farmiga is genuine and depressing. I was able to predict some things from the film, but the way it unfolds mixes the reality of the character's lonely life into the comedic elements of the film. The film balances both of these pretty well and it never weighs one over the other.As mentioned before Bateman is Clooney's boss, his role is not as funny as some would expect from him, given his resume, but he does well. As does everyone else, Zach Galifianakis and J.K. Simmons have bit parts as two employees who lose their jobs. Clooney falls into the role perfectly, he's a normal guy with elite status. He thinks he's better than others, but he doesn't have to think it. He by passes people in lines waiting to buy their tickets, argues the best place to rent a car for luxury and he has a number in mind that he wants to reach in regards of miles flown. If he gets that number, he gets another card to add to his wallet.Up In The Air is funny in subtle ways and respectable in others. It's story is depressing, especially for these times, but Reitman and Co. manage make it lighthearted. This is probably one of my favourite Clooney performances, he's sly and cool and makes people like him when we should despise such a character. The film is enjoyable and will be recognized come Oscar time. I expect to see the performances being rewarded with nominations and I hope to see Reitman get another one. As I said earlier, if his first three films give any indication as to what his future career will be like, then I'm going to be enjoying all of his films.",8,0,6,1 January 2010
V for Vendetta," Modern Classic?
","Alan Moore is not a fan of Hollywood. Who can blame him after watching them butcher his League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen into a brainless popcorn action film that couldn't hold my attention, let alone anyone else. But Moore wasn't a fan of From Hell either. Another bastardized version of a story Moore tells in comic book form. It was style over substance, something that seemed like would happen to this next entry, V For Vendetta.The film and the graphic novel are really different, so I see myself commenting on this as a film itself and not in any way to the original source material. V For Vendetta excels at many levels. It is well written, directed and acted by everyone involved. It has many levels and doesn't get out done by it's high octane style.The script is strong and has a faceless 'hero' or anti-hero, however you look at it. The dialogue is witty, but at times can be a bit much. You either love or hate the introduction V does and if you love it, then you'll most likely love the rest of the film too. The script has a sense of mystery to it and it takes the viewer on the ride of unraveling the truth behind everything. Almost like a murder mystery.The atmosphere helps the film greatly. It has the British taking power in a Hitler like regime and V uses terrorist acts for freedom. The action junkie expecting some thrills will be really disappointed, the film moves at a relative pace, but it's telling a story, not killing dozens of armed men with explosions.Portman does a decent job here, she is incredibly cute in her little girl outfit, then later becomes all Ellen Ripley on us. It's bold, beautiful and is a sign of her commitment to the craft.The film ends up a punch and it leaves you with a smile on your face, the chosen music works perfect with the subject matter and the style of the film. It could be a masterpiece, for it's given genre, but it does have a few missteps, mainly pacing.Overall, I enjoyed this one. It isn't your average comic book flick, it has deeper roots and it is really well done.",8,2,10,20 July 2009
