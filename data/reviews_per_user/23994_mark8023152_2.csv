National Treasure: Book of Secrets," could this be one of the worst films of the year?
","Where to start? The good bits - the London car chase scene was pretty well done. The balancing stone scene was interesting if entirely predictable.The bad bits - well - the way in which each clue was unraveled with a few 'hmm, ah - well, - oh - I know....' - totally ridiculous. The time wasting scene in the Oval Office looking for the 'missing ear ring' were we supposed to take this seriously? Snag is it was so hammed up that it did not gel with the rest of the film.What was Hellen Mirren thinking of? Normally a class act, her little gasps at each new turn of events were completely contrived. 'Goodness - this will unlock the secrets of the Olmec language...' Puh-please.! Hidden city of gold underneath Mt Rushmore - and no-one noticed that nicely lined tunnel leading from the city into the lake these last few hundred years and bothered to ask what was behind the door? This movie was simple, had poor dialogue, no character development and was entirely predictable. The historical and technical leaps to make it all hang together stretched suspension of disbelief beyond any reasonable limits.Sadly, two hours of my life I am not going to get back!",2,4,7,15 January 2008
Cloverfield," Cloverfield - not normally my cup of tea - but in this case.......
","Excellent film. A story of friendship, bravery, doing things because they are right, not because they are easy. Ultimately one of hopelessness - and I guess that would be my beef - - some indication that the humans were getting the upper hand would have been nice, and make the sacrifice of the friends worthwhile.As it is, their friendship and subsequent 'mission' to rescue Beth became futile.The film was well made and got the viewer completely engrossed in the quartet and their progress through Manhattan. The warning about motion sickness due to the hand-held camera is well meant I am sure but after a few minutes I became used to the effect an it certainly added an element of tension. Th cut-backs to the previous film, showing the couple in happier times on Coney Island was a nice touch. It was also good to have no overt camera product placements - but maybe a real video-camera would not have survived the things this one did, so no manufacturer could claim it! The benefits of having a charged cell phone battery at all times led to one of the (few) humorous moments as folk were looting an electronic store for plasma TVs whilst all our hero wants is a battery.The PG rating is probably fair - no bad language - but any parent taking an 8 year old in needs talking to!!",8,1,4,19 January 2008
