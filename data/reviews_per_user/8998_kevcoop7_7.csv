The Hangover," Drunkenness is not a pretty sight.
","I am probably in the vast minority of this movie's fans by claiming I did not like this movie one bit! And Im standing firm with that belief.To start off, I was forced to watch this movie with my family soon after it came out on DVD, and it didn't really hold my attention for very long before I started to do other things, anyways, onto the review itself! To be fair, there was a few things in this movie I enjoyed. For one, I enjoyed the performances of the cast, no complaint there, I liked the set up for the movie, and the cameo by Mike Tyson was indeed hilarious, but thats where my enjoyment of this movie ends.I can't really remember much about this movie, except for the fact I didn't enjoy it, it was lame, stupid, and pretty much went right over my head, and I thought the idea with the guy they were looking for was on the roof the whole time, was just plain idiotic.All in all, I didn't really hate the movie, I just didn't like it either, and 3 stars for the performances and set ups, and the cameo of Mike Tyson.",3,0,2,28 August 2015
Alien," Blood soaked horror
","Never before have I seen a movie this scary! Even Predator isn't THIS scary! Alien is one of those films that creep me out, shock me, horrify me, give me nightmares! Every time it goes dark, I always fear that the Xenomorphs will get me ALien is one of those movies that stands the tests of time, durability, and popularity! 34 years after this movie was originally made, this movie in 2013, is still the greatest and blood soaked horrific movie I have ever seen in my life!",10,2,4,15 January 2013
Predator," The Predator is watching and waiting for you
","Alas, Predator...just the name alone will strike fear into the hearts of men wandering in jungles. And that's exactly what it does in this movie.I have so many compliments and praises for this movie.1) The story-The story is very interesting as it begins with a ship in earth orbit, launching something to the planet, which obviously is the Predator, then Dutch's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) team is commissioned a top secret liberation of a camp in the jungle, but then end up being hunted and killed one by one bye the Predator until only Dutch is left.2) The suspense-Oh yeah, what is going to happen next? When will it happen? How will they die? The suspense is everywhere once Hawkins gets killed.3) The special effects-The plasma caster, the camouflage of the Predator, and the self destruction of the Predator.Anyways, I highly recommend watching this movie! It gets a 10/10, or in my personal scale, 1,000,000/10!",10,1,2,25 October 2012
Batman Begins," Wicked movie
","My third favorite of the Christopher Nolan Batman series.I love how the storyline was developed, and I love how the movie centered on fear.I want to name a few key points I loved about this movie.1) Scarecrow-My favorite villain next to The Riddler and The Joker. I love how they included him in the movie and how he was a major character in this movie.2) Liam Neeson-Haven't seen him in a few years since I watched him as Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. He plays an excellent main antagonist of the movie, and I love how they developed his character(s).3) The fact that Bruce Wayne is helped out by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) in becoming Batman.Overall, I really recommend this movie if someone wants some good ol' Batman action.PS-Only thing I didn't like about this movie, was that Victor Zsasz only has a small amount of screen time.",9,0,1,10 October 2012
Bruce Almighty," Funniest Jim Carrey movie I have seen EVER!!!
","Yep, this movie beats out Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar, and How the Grinch stole Christmas!I LOVE this movie! I have watched it already at least four time sin three days! Plot summary: Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), is down on his luck, when he gets a mysterious call on his pager, so he goes to a building, and meets God (Morgan Freeman) face to face, and God gives Bruce all of his powers.I like the message of this movie. It's a story of not complaining about God, and to have faith in him! I kept laughing out loud at this movie, especially at the part where Bruce is looking through prayers and he has over 3,000,000, and he says 'What a bunch of whiners!' and the part where he makes Evan embarrass himself! I couldn't stop laughing! All in all, it's an incredible movie! I recommend seeing it!",8,1,1,17 January 2013
The Matrix," Welcome to the real world, Neo
","Where do I begin with this review of my favorite all time philosophical, action, sci-fi movie of all time? This movie is a amazingly awesome! Let me give a few pointers...1) THE MUSIC-How can the music is any other movie be as good as this movie's?2) The Action-Holy crap this movie has awesome action scenes in it! One during Neo's fight with Smith in the subway, Neo saving Morpheus and then Trinity from the helicopter crash? How can anything top this?3) The Philosophical elements-I'm not one to focus heavily on philosophy, but this movie has it sprinkled in the storyline, and they don't get shoved down our throats. Like, Morpheus saying 'And I'll show you how far the rabbit hole really goes.' The Matrix itself is also a type of philosophical element. Even when Neo becomes the one, that's from Plato's 'The Allegory of the Cave' from The Republic.4) Bullet Time-an extraordinary technique and it works perfectly in the movie! Neo dodging the Agent's bullets and the fight in the hotel lobby! I can't really continue on this review any longer, I have this to say...I dare anyone to find and watch a movie that can possibly top this movie, heck, this whole trilogy. I freaking dare anyone to this!",10,3,6,9 October 2012
Jurassic Park," Genetics has a dark side
","How do I even begin with this movie? This movie when I first saw it when I was a kid, skyrocketed my interest in dinosaurs, and I STILL have an interest in them. Now, here are my thoughts on this spectacular achievement.1) The animatronics-Wow! The animatronics were mind blowing for their time! I actually thought a T-Rex was chasing doctor Alan Grant throughout the park. The dinosaurs seemed so real! 2) The themes-The main theme of this movie is of how genetic engineering can spread uncontrollably if not monitored with care. The dinosaurs were loose when the park went out of power due to Denis Nedry in a sub-plot. The theme of power over something people can't have power over. These two themes are what really drive the story. 3) The characters-I only want to talk about three characters; Mr. Arnold is played by Samuel 'Jules Winfield' Jackson. Dr Grant is played by Sam Neill, and John Hammond is played the late Richard Attenborough. All in All, this movie will forever be a classic movie I will watch over and over again. I highly recommend this movie.",10,2,3,12 February 2017
