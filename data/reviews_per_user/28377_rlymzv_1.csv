Ford v Ferrari," WARNING: After watching this movie ANY sport other than auto-racing will be boring to you.
","WARNING: After watching this movie, ANY sport other than auto-racing will be boring to you. If I was stranded on a desert island with only 10 Blu-ray movies to keep, this would be one of them.Primarily, this is a racing movie. Le Mans is a very special race in the racing world. Using 2 drivers, they race for 24 hours rain or shine. Obviously, the drivers are very important, but the building of an ultra high performance car that is driven 100% flat-out for 24 hours is the engineering challenge.The movie also tells the fascinating story between Ford and Shelby. A partnership that still exist today, you can still buy a Shelby Mustang for about $20,000 above a standard Mustang price. Clearly, the Shelby name means something to people looking for performance.About 60% of the movie is amazing car racing footage. Having said that, one of the most impressive scenes to me is when Shelby gives Henry Ford II a ride in the Ford GT. Fords reaction, is incredible, and an amazing piece of acting. You might look at Henry Ford II as a stuffy Business Man, but deep down inside he is still a 'Car Guy' and he was blown away with the extreme performance of a 220 mph car.I consider myself a movie buff, I have over 3000 DVDs and Blu-ray's in my collection. I ONLY watch a movie one of two ways. In a movie theater or on a disc from my collection. I never stream. Most of my movies are from the 1930s to 1950s. But, Ford v Ferrari is nothing less than a masterpiece. If it was your job to edit out the boring parts from this movie, you could only eliminate 30 seconds, maximum.A movie like this is best seen on the big screen, the really big screen.",10,2,4,5 December 2019
