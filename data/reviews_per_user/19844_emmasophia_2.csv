The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Intense and Emotional
","To preface my review, yes, I'm a fan of the book. I've heard and read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. People who haven't read the book felt that it was boring and that Hollywood was just trying to drag it out to make two movies. So, I was a bit skeptical when I finally went to see it today.Let me just say, I did NOT feel that it was 'long' or 'slow'. I was waiting for that feeling to sink in since I heard so much about it, but it did NOT occur to me. I was captivated the whole time. I thought the movie was very intense and full of emotions. Maybe it's meant to be slow, so that the viewers (including those who have not read the book) can glean more than just the surface of the story. We got to see Katniss being vulnerable and having genuine feelings to Peeta and treating her sister as an equal (rather than the scared little girl she was back in book 1). We got to see Gale and Katniss grow apart and why. We were immersed with the other districts as to why the Capitol is evil and not to be trusted. The producers were also able to let us know that President Coin is not the 'good guy' necessarily just because she is the president of district 13. I thought Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job with the singing scene. It was so emotional and the song was so fitting. I think this movie was spot on with translating the book to the big screen. Most of the 1/2 of the last book was to setup Katniss as the 'symbol' of their fight and how District 13 carried out that goal. The propos and the film crew that followed Katniss around is a big part of book 3 and leads to a lot of the story that will be Mockingjay Part 2. We get to know Finnick for real, he's not the play boy we thought he was in book 2 and we learn why he became a play boy. We get to see Effie and Katniss really bond and Effie's affection to Katniss.And helloooooo!! It also really setup Katniss showing that she truly loves and cares Peeta. Yes, she has some sort of lust thing for Gale, but her true love lies with Peeta.",10,2,19,13 December 2014
Watchmen," Boring, Pointless, Confusing
","I've never read the graphic novel, nor have I ever heard of the movie prior to the copyright controversy. When the controversy broke, I asked myself 'wth is Watchmen?'. Then the hype followed shortly after the official release date. So, I finally went to watch it with some anticipation. I didn't read any reviews prior to seeing it. I've heard some comments about it from the radio and that's about it. It started off 'okay'. I was a bit confused w/ the random flashbacks...but I had hope. It will get better. Then it just goes down hill from there. This movie is about a bunch of washed up HUMANS with no powers and their desire to dress up in silly masks, spandex and costumes to go fight crimes. There were all these silly side sub plots that totally confused the storyline! Is the nuclear war gonna happen? I don't know cuz it spent so much time on these subplots! Without ever reading the graphic novel, I expected these people to have some 'powers'. They're all quite powerful for not having powers! The sock guy's ink blotch moves...how does he do that?! All in all, it's a bunch of boring people who think that they can save the world. The movie jumps around way to much, doesn't have a solid plot line, bored the hell out of me! The only time I paid attention was when someone's bone popped out or someone's arms got chopped off. Other than those few scenes, I cared less about the blue penis...or the fact that some nerd guy can't get it on w/o his 'pseudo' superhero costume. The gay man who is supposed to be the 'smartest' man on earth. I ultimately walked out about 2 hours in (i think the scene where Blue guy takes Spandex chick to Mars). You can criticize all you want about how I have no place to comment if I didn't finish the film, but honestly, I couldn't BARE to finish it! It was painful! DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! I would recommend watching Paul Blart over this anyday!",1,219,427,17 March 2009
