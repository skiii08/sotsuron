Vertigo," a masterpiece!!!
","'Vertigo' is my favorite movie. Is it the best movie ever made? Perhaps not. It is more of a work of art from Hitchcock and, as been noted by others, a very personal film. This film is about compulsion, obsession and of having , what is to Scotty, the ideal woman in his grasp, only to lose her in tragic circumstances. It is also about guilt, bereavement and murder. Even after Madeleine's death, Scotty cannot let it go. He continues to search for a 'dead' woman. He is almost willing to go to any lengths to recapture what was lost. But as the old saying goes...'be careful what you wish for'?Hitchcock's direction and screen composition is right on. The art direction and color schemes are fantastic. The setting and filming of San Francisco, magnificent. The performances are fantastic all around. However, despite all of the above, the one factor which really sets this film apart as a 'classic' is the Hermann score. It is truly great and captures and adds to the mood and tone of this film in all of its facets.This film should definitely be rated higher on this site. I guess without constant explosions, shootings, car chases and other myriad CGI effects todays audiences could not sit through this movie. To watch this film is to watch a master at his craft during the height of his creative genius. A definite 10!!!",10,5,6,17 February 2008
Independence Day," Pathetic Hollywood Bubblegum
","An absolutely horrible movie, definitely in my Top Ten of 'worst movies of all time.' A typical dumbed-down Hollywood cartoon of a film, designed to appeal to the 18-24 yo demographic. This 'film' consists of so many blatant stereotypes, unbelievable situations, horrible acting, cheesy special-effects and an ending so far-fetched that it would strain credibility to a 4 year old. I will not go into detail on my comments to the above, as they have already been well-described in many other reviews and I will not waste the readers time. However, I will conclude with one other point about this movie which really irks me. It is the blatantly loud, pro-American jingoism that permeates this film. It is so over the top that it is embarrassing, and I say this as a proud American. How I yearn for a return to the old American virtues of humbleness, quiet pride and the 'can-do' attitude of the past. The in-your-face flag-waving, posing, posturing, rudeness and general ignorance of other peoples and nations shown in this and many other simplistic films of this nature is quite pathetic. It is no wonder that so much of the rest of the world has such a negative attitude towards my country these days.",1,2,4,21 January 2008
