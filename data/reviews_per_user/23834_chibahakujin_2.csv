50 First Dates," Best Sandler Movie Yet
","While Happy Gilmore is my favorite Sandler comedy, 50 1st Dates is his best all-around film. It's shot beautifully, it has such a great heart, and Rob Schneider gives a genuinely great performance--I know Schneider and great performances usually aren't used in the same sentence unless in jest, but he's really good here. Even though there seems to be a lot here in common with other Sandler films, this one has something a lot of his other romantic comedies didn't: a really great story to go with the gimicky premise. As for the characters, Sandler plays his basic lovable-loser and Drew Berrymore is her usual sweet self and Tom Blake and Hobbit emeritus Sean Astin (who was basically a character designed for a running gag) also deliver in solid supporting roles. Throw in a walrus and penguin for the kids and you've got a classic on your hands. Let's hope Sandler continues to grow and go outside his usual gang of pals for future scripts and then somewhat 'Sandlerize' them for a bit of irreverent comedy the way he did w/ 50 FIRST DATES.",10,0,1,10 January 2005
Predator," Great Film, Great DVD
","The movie is a genre classic and stands as some of Arnold's best work. For those who've never seen the film the plot basically breaks down as: the wild bunch is hunted in a South American jungle by a big, ugly alien.The latest 2-disc DVD got a neat re-packaging for the 2004 release of AVP and has some really great featurettes including an 'easter egg' with look back by some of the cast and crew on the the former future Governor Ventura. Arnold's Governorship wasn't discussed as all the 'updated' interviews were done in 2001. So I'm guessing all the features on the new re-packaged '04 DVD are the same as the 2001 DVD except for a brief 2 minute 'inside look' at AVP.",9,0,1,3 January 2005
