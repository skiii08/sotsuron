The Ring," a poor copy
","I must admit that I saw the original Japanese version of this film before seeing THE ring (the original being called 'ring' and directed by Hideo Nakata) my first impression was not good at all: the actors were badly chosen, they don't manage to get the feelings of the fear of the unknown through. and that's more or less what this film is about the sound track is a basic Hollywood sound track, no surprises there.I then asked myself why remake a film that was not only incredibly well shot, well directed and scary as hell to make the pale simulacre? the only answer I could come up with is that the American audience doesn't like watching Japanese films with subtitles.If you don't mind subtitles get the DVD of 'ring' and then you'll see a REAL horror film",Null,0,1,31 August 2004
