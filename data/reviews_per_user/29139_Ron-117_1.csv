Scarface," This is the best site on the web, if you're into oldies as I am. Thanks for being here
","As I probably own all of Pacino's films (including Panic in needle park, his first I think)Scarface,other then Dog day afternoon is his best acting of all other of his movies.The part of Johnny Montana had to be hard as heck,with the need of using the cuban accent throughout the movie.He was outstanding with the attitude portrayed by him throughout the story.The violence was extremely realistic. The only thing that I didn't care for was that after the movie was shown a negative feeling toward hispanics was expressed. I'm american White but my hispanic friends told me it did affect them for a while. But all in all it is a great movie",9,0,1,2 January 1999
