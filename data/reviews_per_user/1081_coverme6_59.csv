Saturday Night Fever," 'You should be dancing... yeah!'
","Funny, the ploto of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was never, EVER, mentioned as terrific. SNF will be forever remembered as one of the greatest dance musicals of all time. Who can ever forget John Travolta's grooves on the disco floor, boogeying to the Bee Gees' hits of the decade? And of course, what about Travolta's hair?

Scarface," A dynamite gangster flick
","Al Pacino goes hogwild on life and excess in SCARFACE, a film about the rise and a literal fall of a powerful Cuban mobster Tony Montana. He spread chaos and bloodshed in order to keep his empire of cocaine intact, but it all crumbled down on him as a result of his ego taking over his senses. Unlike his other mafioso role as the cool and collectedMichael Corleone, Pacino was on the rampage portraying Montana, with nearly every sentence he says contains the F-word. Violence was also an option for this guy, so SCARFACE ran amuck with graphic killings.Intolerant viewers may be turned off by the excessive violence and the vulgarity, but make no mistake. The performances were undeniably awesome.",Null,0,0,19 July 2001
Spartacus," Kubrick and Douglas... perfect together!
","Stanley Kubrick and Kirk Douglas's greatest collaboration, SPARTACUS, holds strong as one of the best epic movies ever. The film, about the huge slave uprising against the Romans sometime before the birth of Christ, bursts will extravagant settings, fantastic costumes, and thrilling warrior scenes that make GLADIATOR look like SESAMESTREET. Not only does the eye candy help in gaining the viewer'sattention, but the acting by everyone involved is first rate. Kirk Douglas is typically great portraying the movie's namesake, the slave determined to bring down the Roman empire. Laurence Olivieris equally masterful as Spartacus' Roman nemesis, while Tony Curtis and Jean Simmons supply sentimental material as the people closest to Spartacus' life. In the director's seat, Kubrick scores high inhis second big-budget epic film following PATHS OF GLORY, which also starred Douglas. When you've got a fluid combination of actor and director, it's an unbeatable mix. Douglas and Kubrick have proved that.",Null,1,3,26 March 2002

Humphrey Bogart made himself as what he is today, the headlining movie star, in this film about love and war in the seamy world of Morrocco during the Second World War.

I kept thinking, 'God, kid, are you crazy or just plain stupid??' The whole point of this flick is how a group of teens would do and how in order to lose their virginity.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An absolutely spectacular film -- 100% Oscar-caliber
","J.R.R. Tolkien's classic book series THE LORD OF THE RINGS comes to life in the form of an action-packed thrill ride of a movie. Beginning the popular fantasy trilogy is the current film THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, about how a rag-tag band of adventurers (whom of which consists of a variety of beings, from human to elf to dwarf, and of course, the Hobbits) go on a perilous quest to destroy what looks like aninnocent ring, which in reality contains special powers originally made for evil. Filled with lush landscape design (check out the snowy mountainsides and the rolling mountains), eye-filling special FX, great costumes by all the characters, hyperkinetic action sequences (especially the near-dizzying swordplay), and of course, greatperformances from the whole cast. Elijah Wood displays a very convin- cing portrayal of Frodo, a young Hobbit with a huge burden on hislittle back of trying to destroy the powerful ring. Alongside him is Gandalf (played with subtle eloquence by Ian McKellan, in a role that almost went to Sean Connery), the wise old wizard who guides Frodo, much like how Obi-Wan Kenobi advised young Luke Skywalker (if you the reader are as much of a STAR WARS fan as you are of the LOTR would realize the parallels each movie displays), and Aragorn the Strider,played with neo-Clint Eastwood machismo by Viggo Mortenson. The sole complaint that I have about this film is the movie's length of 3 hours. The discriminating viewer would find his attention span to drift away after sticking it to the screen within that time range. But thanks toall the great factors I've mentioned above, the little problem with time can be over-looked. LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING isa definite winner and is bound to win an Academy award. Would it win best picture? I won't be a bit surprised.Harry Who? :-)",Null,0,0,23 December 2001

The horrors that Willard had seen on the way to Kurtz' whereabouts were bad enough, having undergone airstrikes and countless attacks by the Vietcong. But when Willard finally meets Kurtz, heencountered the line between reality and madness.

American History X," The film that brought up the issue that can't be ignored

Butwhile in the joint, Derek sees the light, and he vows to change his ways, and likewise for his kid brother Danny (Eddie Furlong). Danny himself is a skinhead, and he embraced the evils of racism himself,until Derek decides to do whatever it takes to get his brother out of the abyss. Though you would despise him at first (especially during his flashbacked scenes where Derek would lecture about how 'the white man is being ripped-off'), Norton amazingly transforms his character into good, realizing that everything he has done is wrong. Furlong also does a great job having that personal tug-of-war between hislove and admiration towards Derek, and his pride in racism. AMERICAN HISTORY X proves to be a good lesson in ethics and morality; sure, it basically feeds off the emotions of viewers, no matter what he or she thinks about our ever-changing society.

Schindler's List," A haunting look at one of the most brutal periods in history (contains spoilers)
","Steven Spielberg directs what is arguably considered one of his best films, the poignant and terribly depressing SCHINDLER'S LIST. Shot in stark black and white to display the gritty atmosphere of theconcentration camps, SCHINDLER'S LIST portrays the life of OskarSchindler, a greedy, womanizing Nazi businessman who has a change of heart after witnessing the slaughter of the Jews during the Holocaust. Playing the role of Schindler is Liam Neeson, who expresses a profound mix of feelings that his character must have endured: loyalty for his fellow Nazi comrades, and sympathy for the victims of the travesty. Quite the opposite is Ralph Finnes, who portrays the stone- cold Nazi stooge Amon Goeth. There are no feelings other than disgust and resentment towards Goeth, who callously and thoughtlessly kills every Jewish prisoner in his camps. The excessive images of carnage and gore might turn off some viewers, but they're shown to prove the horrors of the Holocaust, and the rampant, hateful image of the Nazis. Sure enough, I couldn't get the depressing, haunting scenes of death out of my head. But, thanks to Schindler, hope was restored to those poor people, proving there is hope when it looks impossible to exist.",Null,9,13,4 April 2002

A Beautiful Mind," A tour de force for both the cast and the director
","Russell Crowe and Ron Howard made an unbeatable team when they made A BEAUTIFUL MIND, the touching biographical drama about the life and times of Princeton professor John Forbes Nash. Crowe poignantlyportrays Nash, whom over a span of 40 years, suffered terriblehallucinations despite being mentally brilliant in the field of mathematics. Jennifer Connelly won her well-deserved Oscar as Nash's doting wife, who stood by her man as he fell into a deep abyss of schizophrenia. Ron Howard's direction is fine as always, showcasing Nash's live over the years, and telling the story that might throw off viewers at first with intriguing twists, but he never fails to entertain.",Null,0,2,12 April 2002
Die Hard," 'Welcome to the party, pal!!'
","'Die Hard' has to be the mother of all terrorist thrillers. Here, you've got one mean cop armed with only a beretta against a group of Euro-trash terrorists, which the battleground is a really tall skyscraper in Los Angeles. What follows is a rip-roaring roller coaster ride with no limits and no mercy.Bruce Willis plays his arguably most popular trademark character ever as John McClane, a New York cop vacationing in L.A. for the Christmas season to see his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who is attending a party in her office in a skyscraper. John and Holly bicker a little bit, fighting over their decaying marital status, until when a group of terrorists led by a nasty German named Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his right-hand man Karl (the scary Alex Godunov) crash the party and demand the code to a hidden vault in the building that contains a huge fortune. So, in true Hollywood fashion, McClane takes on the baddies by upsetting every move they make. Not only does McClane have to worry about the killers, but the LAPD and the feds are also on his case. This leads to one harrowing showdown between cop and criminals.This film leads a whole line of wannabes that try to imitate the original, and which some were successful. Willis is outstanding because he portrays an action hero who is more human than most characters, and he's more chattier, too. Bedelia also sheds a spark of humanity, as does future 'Family Matters' star Reg VelJohnson as honest LAPD cop Al Powell. Alan Rickman is ultra sleazy and nasty as the main heavy, a scuzzball with no remorse,",Null,0,0,11 June 2000

","'The Matrix' is definitely a film of epic proportions. Withgreat, eye-popping special effects, splendidly cheographed gunfights that would make John Woo blush, and larger-than-lifeperformances by the stars. When this movie first came out in mid'99, 'Star Wars: the Phantom Menace' was still wowing manymovie-goers. But 'The Matrix' gave viewers a whole new ride, onethat made 'Star Wars' look pitifully weak, and well.... DEAD!Keanu Reeves is Thomas Anderson, AKA Neo, a mild-manneredbusinessman/computer hacker, who is given the shock of his lifewhen he discovers that he is chosen by an elite team ofphysically and mentally enhanced individuals, led by amysterious guru named Morpheus (played by the mystifyingLaurence Fishburne). This team shows Neo the world of theMatrix, which is basically the real world, which our world isbasically false. Everything in the real world is in shamblesbecause of the fact that machines have taken order. Neoreluctantly agrees to take part in rebelling against themachines, battling against the agents, evil folks who masteredthe Matrix's powers who despise the rebels.Other than the fact that the effects in this movie are dynamic,the inspirations and philosophy behind 'The Matrix' is alsocompelling. This movie had borrowed many ideas and concepts fromother movies, such as 'Star Wars' (the idea of using an innerforce within), 'The Terminator' (the idea of man againstmachine), 'Fight Club' (breaking away from society), and 'Men inBlack' (the wearing of Rayban sunglasses and the idea of joiningan elite cult and not going back to regular life). 'The Matrix' is most probably the kind of movie that will becomea true landmark in the history of cinema; the kind that will bea major influence to many other films to come, as did 'StarWars' and 'The Terminator.'

","Martin Scorsese delivers the ultimate gangster flick, and his argueably finest movie ever. Complete with an ensemble cast consisting of Robert DeNiro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Lorraine Bracco, the actors leave no stone unturned as they play their parts with a lot of heart and soul, as if it would be the big- gest roles of their lives. 'Goodfellas' is a film about the 30-year exploits of a young New York kid named Henry (Liotta), who becomes infatuated with mob life when he is 'adopted' by a mafia family. Soon, Henry and his two best buds Jimmy (DeNiro in his most sadistic role ever!) and Tommy (Pesci, whose delightfully evil here), paint the town red and cause chaos towards rival hoods. Henry later marries a local girl named Karen (Bracco), who seems like putty in Henry's hands, but becomes shocked when she discovers her husband's true colors with the mafia. With tension filled scenes and a gripping script which is narr- ated by the 3 leads, (a concept used in another brilliant Scor- sese flick 'Casino') the viewer will feel every bit of the heat that is simmered by the cast and atmosphere. Plus, a lively soundtrack consisting of rock music and old Italian love songs make the movie more enjoyable to the viewer. The only flaws that might make the viewer cringe are the slightly grim vio- lence (check out the beginning of the movie.
