The Ring," How bad can it be
","Ok, this movie is like too bad to even rate.  Father of the adopted girl was reading his lines as he gave his big speach, YOU CAN even see his eyes darting back and forth over the cue cards instead of looking at the other person.The clips seemed to be outtakes or sophmoric effort of film school 15 min shorts.  We had the blood / drain scene, the pulling of a finger nail from a well, the lit tree on a hil and water pooling on the floor.Needless to say the parts they stole from other movies says it all.  BAD BAD BADwasnt even scary and typical ending.  Just a sad movie over all and I wasted 4 bucks.  Where is my RMA on this tripe",1,24,52,28 May 2003
