The Longest Yard," Remake?
","After watching the movie i had the impression that the longest yard is the remake of a British film called 'Mean Machine' with Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham... This was really good movie! Still the performances of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock were great! Laughed a lot, but still it did not feel right... Mean machine (the movie) was more about the relationship between the prisoners while the longest yard did merely anything to develop itself in that direction... Anyone who saw mean machine and would like to comment...And is it said anywhere that it is a remake?!But still was a very entertaining movie to watch...",7,0,0,3 July 2005
