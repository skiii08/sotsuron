The Blair Witch Project," Blair witch!
","This film scared the pants out of me! I saw it when i was 15 and i must say i could not fall a sleep for at least two nights after it. At first you will think what a junk, documentary. Students lost in the forest trying to find the way out. So what? You will not even see a witch. Turn on your imagination, because THIS IS the scariest part of the film. You do not see your enemy, what could be worse. Those students were scared for real, they did not know that everything was one big evil prank! In the end of the film i was so frightened, that it was hard for me to brief. I had a feeling like i am sitting in the middle of the forest near girl, who is sending last message to her parents. Remember my words, if you have not seen this movie - you HAVE to! You will get the best experience watching this film late at night when nobody is at home! My buddy saw this film, when he was 18. A grown up man i must say! He returned home late at night shaking like a rabbit. Trying to open the door looking around, hoping nobody is behind! Ohhhh what a movie. Watch it, and believe me you will be afraid walking in the dark forest for the rest of your life!!!",10,1,3,13 August 2005
