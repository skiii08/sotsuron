Casablanca," Why do I like this movie so much?
","It really says something about a film, when a person like myself continually goes back again and again to watch and whole heartedly declare Casablanca as my favorite film of all time. I am a 21 year old male, an avid snowboarder and society could easily label myself as a no-good punk kid. So, if Boogie Nights, Pulp Fiction, Swingers and Usual Suspects round out my top 5, why does Casablanca a B/W, 1942 romance movie take the cake?I could rant about the acting, script, story, direction and so on and so on. Its been done. Its the magic of the movie that makes it so great, not movie magic in general just the specific magic this movie emits each and every viewing. Truly great films break contemporary demographic traditions, and Casablanca changed the way I view film. It is a wonderful film and the reason why this punk loves movies.",10,1,1,12 May 2000
