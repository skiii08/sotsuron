The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A high school freshman with psychological issues is befriended by two seniors who give him something he desperately needs, friendship.
","'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' follows Charlie, a high school freshman with more psychological issues than friends. Don't feel too bad for him though, he is soon befriended by two seniors, one of which is played by Emma Watson (hubba hubba). His friendship helps him overcome some of his issues, for a time, but it seems that his real battle is with himself, and only he can be a part of the fight.My brief synopsis aside, I can honestly say that this is what a John Hughes film would be if he would have been born twenty years later. I started this movie with every intention of not liking it, mission impossible. The character development is complex, and I actually find myself caring for these made up people, Charlie in particular, who is so awkward sometimes I had to pause the movie because well..I worried about the guy. The movie deals with all of the problems of a high schooler from not having friends to being gay, and it even covers more serious issues towards the end. The ability to create genuine characters that the viewer will not only like, but care about, seems to be a lost art in this generation, but in this case I think someone did their homework.I think that having a writer who is also a director can be a double edged sword. It is good to take your vision and direct it without any interference from another person, but at times it is good to have a second opinion. Writing is like a child, you fall in love with it maternally, therefor even if it is sitting in a classroom covered in glitter, eating glue, it is still your perfect little ball of sunshine. Luckily, I do not think that director Stephen Chbosky let his emotions interfere with his project.My only complaint is the ending, which seems rushed. Chbosky drops a bomb on us, then fifteen minutes later before we have even come to terms with it the credits are rolling. What happened? Oh well, nothing is perfect (Not even Emma Watson). We accept the movies that we think we deserve, and after some of the flops of the year, I think we deserved this one.",7,0,0,9 June 2014
Pacific Rim," As aliens start to emerge from the ocean and attack cities giant robots are created to fight back, but will they be enough?
","The movie starts out with the main character, played by Charlie Hunnam, talking about the arrival of aliens who seem nearly indestructible, and the creation of a new weapon to fight, which was basically just a giant rock em sock em robot. About 7 minutes later, what seemed a lot longer, we finally get out of voice over mode. I would have been mad, but in the film's defense, it jumps right into an action packed fight scene. The special effects were quite good, and the monsters, or Kaiju were pretty damn well put together. I would say that they were definitely intimidating enough to scare a little kid, much like the movie 'Gigli.' The movie was over two hours long, but it was paced very well. You get a lot of plot and good acting between fight scenes. Charlie Day was hilarious as always, it seems no matter what role he plays you end up just wanting to hang out and have a few beers at the bar with him. Charlie Hunnam was on point, nothing special, but he was supported by Rinko Kikuchi playing the female lead, who is not only hubba hubba attractive, but can also act. Clifton Collins Jr. and Idris Elba also had notable performances. There was an unexpected cameo from Ron Perlman, (no he wasn't in his Hellboy costume) who was an interesting character himself.When you think giant robots fighting aliens you find yourself wondering if you are going to remember old childhood cartoons and feel somewhat nostalgic, but 'Pacific Rim' does a good job of keeping the concept fresh and keeping you in the now. I didn't make one Voltron comment! The fight scenes are well shot and not a giant blur like in some action movies. Guillermo del Toro did notable work directing, but I couldn't help but feel like something was missing from this movie, that little something special he put into his other projects. Even without that something, 'Pacific Rim' is definitely worth the watch.",6,0,3,9 June 2014
The Wolverine," Wolverine is summoned to Japan by an old friend who makes him an offer that may be too good to be true.
","Rating a movie based on a comic book is always hard. I want to take points away when they change things and divert from the original comic, but in a sense these movies are a re-envisioning, so I strictly rate them without bias. The Wolverine, which is mostly set in Japan, holds its own on the action front, but I find the story line to be predictable, even for someone who is not a comic book fan. Hugh Jackman, who seems to have the role as Wolverine down to a science, does do the character justice, but I think a lot of movie goers are tired of seeing him. This is Jackman's fifth time playing Wolverine (excluding first class, which he was in for about 1 minute).Aside from Wolverine there were only two other mutants in this movie, Yukio and Viper. Although Viper's powers were interesting, Yukio's mutant abilities fell short. Her fighting skill did indeed add action, but I think you either need to go all in or not at all when making a movie based on a comic book. To the film's credit, it does have a strong story which is conveyed to the viewer in a more focused manner, unlike Wolverine Origins.I would have rated this movie higher, but I think that it fell apart towards the end. The 'twist' and climax were not as exciting as I had hoped and certain aspects of its conclusion were disheartening. I give the writer's credit for trying something new, not including a slough of mutants, and using a more traditional story telling structure, but the strength of the movie fades as it progresses, and by the end I am not as attentive as one would want their viewer.",6,0,0,9 June 2014
Win Win," For financial benefit, a lawyer on the verge of losing his practice becomes the guardian of a wealthy elderly man, and somehow ends up raising his teenage grandson.
","Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti), is a struggling lawyer and volunteer wrestling coach who offers to become an elderly man's guardian for the financial benefits. Flaherty claims that he wishes to become his client Leo's guardian to ensure that his wish of living at home can see fruition, but soon realizes it would be too much work and sends him to a retirement home. He is free and clear until Leo's grandson Kyle comes to town to stay with his grandfather, but instead ends up living with the Flahertys. The entire family soon bonds with Kyle, and to Mike's surprise he is a wrestling sensation, but all secrets come out eventually.'Win WIn' is charming in the sense that it deals with normal people and everyday life. In the movie Paul Giamatti's family has money problems that need a real solution. This issue, which cannot be solved in a three minute montage with 'Push it to the Limit' playing in the background forces Giamatti's character to make the wrong decision for the right reasons. That decision's weight on his conscience is inevitably what makes him take in Leo's grandson Kyle thus redeeming himself as a likable character. Writers Koe Tiboni and Thomas McCarthy do a wonderful job creating characters with real flaws the audience can relate to thus creating the feeling that characters on the screen are as human as themselves.Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan both fit perfectly into their roles as suburban parents, and in his first performance Alex Shaffer manages to hold his own with the veteran actors. The somewhat unbelievable story is told in a manner that does not leave the viewer asking questions like 'can that really happen,' or 'would they really do that?' 'Win Win' is not a laugh out loud dramedy (drama/comedy), but it is darkly humorous. While you are rooting for the Flaherty family, you also secretly wish them some mild misfortune because whether it be a panic attack while jogging, or a teenager out wrestling an adult, sometimes it is just nice to laugh at the misfortune of others. Watching Mike Flaherty both deceive Leo and care for Kyle,'Win Win' truly shows us that what a person will do for their family is astounding, but what they will do for a total stranger, now that's beautiful.",7,1,1,9 June 2014
Gladiator," After a Roman soldier is betrayed by his emperor's son he is sold into slavery and forced to fight as a gladiator.
","'Gladiator' comes out of the gate swinging, immediately opening on the battlefield. Caesar Marcus Aurelius stands off to the side of the battle watching General Maximus Meridius (Crowe) lead his troops to yet another victory. After the battle Maximus longs to return to his family, but Marcus Aurelius wishes to have Maximus succeed him as a regent, in a step towards eventually turning Rome back into a republic. Aurelis feels that his son Commodus is too unjust to rule and that Maximus will unselfishly give Rome back to the people. Commodus learns of his father's plan and before anyone else is informed of the Caesar's wishes he is killed by his son. Commodus then takes control of Rome and condemns Maximus and his family to death when Maximus refuses to pledge his loyalty to the new Caesar.This film is the first large scale movie set in ancient Rome since the 1960â€²s; it basically combines the plots of 'Ben-Hur' and 'Sparticus' then adds a dash of 'Braveheart' for good measure. 'Gladiator' is the first movie I've reviewed that had me torn between two numbers to the point that I had to incorporate a half option in my stats section. This movie is director Ridley Scott's first since his box office bomb 'G.I. Jane,' which lost over 40 million dollars. Luckily for Scott this movie was well received by critics in addition to being a commercial success. 'Gladiator' won five academy awards including best picture, and grossed over 180 million dollars, but I feel it still had flaws. In my review I will focus mainly on the problems that I had with the movie rather than its merit. 'Gladiator' is fourteen years old and it is still considered a notable success, and anything positive I have to say on top of that would simply be redundant.To begin, Ridley Scott hired historians to ensure that this would be the most accurate movie ever made about Rome, but the story is still full of historical inaccuracies. It is true, that sometimes history must be changed when making a movie to keep the audience interested or to keep the story progressing smoothly, but the inaccuracies to which I refer were sever enough to lead to one historian quitting Scott's team and another asking for their name to be removed from the credits. While I am not going to sit here and list every single deviation from historical fact, I do find the need to raise one query. Why does a Spanish born Roman general have an accent from Australia, a country that during the time period would not existed for over a thousand years? If I only had to review the first forty minutes of this movie, up until Maximus becomes a gladiator, I would consider it perfect. At this point the movie noticeably loses pace, and even the incorporation of the gladiator fight scenes do not help. Luckily, 'Glatiator' still has one ace up its sleeve, Commodus does not know that Maimus is the famous Spaniard. Oh wait, never mind, he finds out immediately following the first battle in the Colosseum! When Maximus removes his helmet to reveal his identity to Commodus he also removes the remaining tension. I wanted Maximus to thrust forward with the fury that only a man who has had his wife and child brutally slain could posses, and nothing.The audience is left to trudge through another hour in a half of hollow fight scenes and Commodus' scheming. Another hour in a half of a second rate villain lusting after his own sister, listening to himself talk, and emitting seriously creepy vibes towards his nephew. Another hour in a half of plot and sub plot with its merit being outweighed by the urge to hit the fast forward button on the remote, just for a little bit. As the movie comes to a close the viewer is rewarded with one last mediocre fight scene pitting two completely unmatched opponents against each other, then poof, it ends. We are left wondering what could have been if everything went right, like the star quarterback that blew out his knee right before going pro.",7,1,2,14 June 2014
