Ford v Ferrari," Worth watching
","The true story behind the 1966
24 hour Le Mans race serves as a story for the crossing paths between Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) and the eccentric British driver, Ken Miles (Christian Bale) and how they come together to take down Enzo Ferrari and show ford off as a top contender.James Mangold directs the racing sequences to convey not just the frenetic energy, but also to further the character arcs. Besides the two leads, the supporting cast contributes acting was good.
Mollie miles - caitronia balfe
Leo Beebe - Josh Lucas
Peter miles Noah jupe
Phil Remington - ray mckinnon
Charlie agapiou - jack McMullenClimax - You promised me the drive. Not the win.'
Bale is the real focus here and he should be with his amazing believable performance but Damon also does a pretty convincing job as the friend and his knowledge of cars along with Bale's love for them.Now, let's talk about cinematography. The movie gives absolutely stunning experience with it's sound effects and visuals. The movie though was shot under expert guidance, feels more legit.Overall, THIS IS A MUST SEE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,3,4,5 February 2020
Captain Marvel," it's definitely not as bad as people say. Is it great?...... no but it's good
","If you're comparing this to Black Panther (last years best film) or Avengers Infinity War, then yeah, you might be let down a bit. But as a stand alone Marvel film, it works on almost every level.Cap Marvel is simple, plain, flat in terms of Storytelling although there are few surprises in the middle, keep this in mind that it's an origin story. I loved the cat's part in the movie and i couldn't stop laughing, I loved how the directors showed the part where Nick Fury lost his eye & Also don't miss the post credit scene, it's amazing! Really gets you hyped for Avengers Endgame. Definitely recommend it's very enjoyable and don't believe what haters saying.You can judge the movie yourself.
Message: This movie does a good job in conveying the importance of individuality and the strength that comes with being your own person.",7,0,2,10 March 2019
Us," Unanswered questions
","The film from starting to certain time pretty good Tricky, intriguing and the seat thriller. The main tethered character tells that's They could use them to control the ones above. But they failed abandoned the tethered. Once they have failed what's they created for why the government did not destroyed the tethered.
( movie didn't explained this.)When the climax reaches and you almost believe that you have found almost all your answers instead it will drive you crazy with more question.
After that the film needs more explanationwhat exactly the tethered are going to go against humans. It is a bit confusing and I find that the twist will not make much sense considering the situation and continuity of the storyline considering that she is a clone.I recommend seeing it for the sake of the actor's performances. I will give rating nly for 6/10 actor & actress performaned well. Jordan Peele has put a lot of effort and work into to try to make his vision a visual reality. I appreciate his hard work.",6,3,4,14 January 2020
Knives Out," vibrant panache and punctilious.
","Knives out is the kind of whodunnit film & very fashionable movie that will never fail to entertain. It's grand ensemble of familiar faces. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow & the scenario.The film filled with surprises with turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it.Even though the movie ended up being with a predictable ending, knives out is a good film. Once watchable.",7,2,3,3 March 2020
The Irishman," I heard you paint houses - 7.5 if it's there
","The irishman first thought that came to me when I saw the Irishman was that it's so long. 3 hours and 29 minutes. Although it's run time is long, not a single frame felt pointless.The movie is what I call the good film of Martin Scorsese, but it's not a best Like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas. Its comes under good movies of 2019 .
It is great in it's script, cast, story telling, editing, cinematography, and background music.the visual effects in the movie - The movie has a difficult task, because the entire runtime takes place in the past and occasionally it will cut back to a present day/older De Niro, aka what he looks like now, Special mention must be given to the extensive use of CG de-aging (the film takes place over a span of decades) which surprisingly was done well.
The Irishman exactly puts the story of the 90's in an impeccable manner, Robert De Niro's smooth story narration. From his young age times to old age situations, the movie is thoroughly connected by small incidents which in turn make it an hitman, teamsters members.Robert De Niro plays a cold, yet charismatic gangster, Frank Sheeran - a friend of Jimmy Hoffa &
Russell Bufalino.Al Pacino plays a loud month Jimmy Hoffa that's a huge ball of energy and reeks of desperation, which Pacino portrays beautifully.Joe Pesci plays Russell Bufalino, a silent and collective man who sniffs out trouble and takes care of 'business'.Talented acting, acting legend & terrific amazingly subtle and soft spoken performance that many have been calling tremendous.Aside, I'm struggling to remember other characters' but who played
Crazy Joe - Sebastian maniscalco
Tony pro - Stephen Graham
Bill buffalino - ray romano
Peggy sheeran - Anna paquin supporting characters played Well even though they have 10 to 20min screen timing in movie. Other than it's not able to remember others characters.Frank's relationship with his daughters, especially Peggy, shows just how dicey parenting can be, that the best possible choices may not necessarily give the best result, and that a sheltered upbringing is more of a handicap than a positive in helping children truly understand the world.Good Movie, enjoyable but not a best of Martin Scorsese.
Quotes I liked - Everybody's afraid. And you pray a lot. I prayed a lot.
2. Sooner or later, everybody put here has a date when he's going to go. That's just the way it is.'
3. you don't know how fast time goes by until you get there. But you don't have to worry about that, because you have your whole life ahead of you. Forever. It goes fast, time. I'm telling you.",7,1,2,9 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," brilliant way to finish the infinity saga:
","This is the most amazing movie I've ever seen, i have watched all the marvel franchise numerous times but this tops everything. It was extremely well acted, the actors and actresses should be greatly credited. Very emotionally impacting, which was done beautifully well. Hopefully not giving any spoilers, it has (in my opinion) the best battle scene i have ever seen. This is a brilliant way to finish the infinity saga and i look forward to see what marvel brings next, though i don't think it will ever be the same again, i hope anyone who reads this enjoyed or will enjoy it as much as i did, marvel you are truly amazing.",9,0,0,28 April 2019
1917," Technically Riveting
","1917 renders much of a survival movie like Dunkirk rather than non stopping war shootings genre. The movie looked fantastic and the scenes and shots were breath taking.Sam Mendes use of almost continuous filming aids the overall story. Two young n.c.o.s picked for what looks like a suicide mission.Cinematographer - Roger deakins, was fantastic, absolutely, some stunning.
It is designed as two extraordinary long, unbroken shots, itself is worthy of an Oscar win.The cast is also brilliant, with each actor giving stellar performances and countless cameos from well renowned figures such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Richard Madden.The plot is where the downside comes. Mind that it is great and propulsively executed but the emptiness of the sub-stories is what 1917 suffers.Overall I think this is worth-watchable, expertly made war film.",8,4,6,10 March 2020
The Mountain II," Must watchable, best film
","I saw this without seeing the first part but still I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The Mountain II shows perspective on both sides both civilian, the military and the journalist. It shows also why journalist do what they do show the cruelty that is in the world and why they criticize violence against violence and human rights. It shows also the civilians who fall in between as victims and the conflict of standing by to do your duty or doing what you know is right. The Mountain II is movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honour and duty.The explanation by the team leader to this fellow commando on saving the journalist was top notch. Even the contents of the letter which team leader gives to journalist was very well done.In this movie we see a lots of great examples of best visual effects. And also it has its own realistic scenes as well. The connection between soldiers were so great, enthusiastic and natural.I give this movie my highest recommendation. If you want to watch military movie from Turkish cinema, you should watch this movie. Must watchable movie.",8,3,4,5 March 2020
Joker," Scintillating performance
","Joaquin Phoenix has acted beautifully and mesmerising. How a sequence of bad events can make an already unstable person to full blown psychosis. The way Joaquin laughed, smiled, cried and even those intense glare he gave spoke so much emotion. It was truly magnificent seeing an actor showing the characters emotion through their eyes.
The state of how Arthur became The Joker is very well depicted.üî•üî•
This movie wasn't slow, it wasn't boring, it was building. From the opening scene to the very end.üî•üî•üëèüëè. Joker - For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice.üòéüî•
Phoenix deserve a Oscar üëè",9,2,3,5 October 2019
Parasite," Masterclass film
","Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do.",8,9,12,3 February 2020
Marriage Story," Individual performance
","Marriage story is a insightful and solicitous look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. The plot is a pastiche of a modern day 'Kramer v. Kramer'. It has lots going for it including two very charismatic and convincing performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson as a married couple, This is original filmmaking at its finest.
The core issue is that the breadwinner is Charlie and his wife Nicole wants to move from NY to LA to get a part in a show. Charlies elects to stay in NY and continue directing his successful broadway plays. Both parties here are selfish. Couples interactions are pure and honest but more importantly real, you don't get to take sides in their problem as well as they both make a good case and put forth good arguments to their difficulties, one other thing I noticed is that it invites you to understand but never forces you to accept it in any way, all of this comes together to describe or at least try to understand the intricacies of a loving marriage.Marriage Story accurately exposes what actually goes on when couples turn to lawyers to help them with their divorce rather than go thru mediation. Kudos for exposing our circus of a legal system and the lawyers who are still practicing this archaic type of matrimonial law that wreaks destruction on parents, children and bank accounts.
Minus - The couple never actually asks the child what he's going through. Good movie.",7,5,6,4 January 2020
