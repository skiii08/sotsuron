E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Awww....aren't we just too cute?
","Foul-mouthed precocious little kids and a plot that hasn't aged well.  So why does this film continue to pose as 'family fare'?   See it and satisfy your curiosity, or pass it up (recommended) for a good film, one that will compliment your family's intelligence.  They're out there.  (The films, I mean.)",4,5,12,29 September 1999
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," There really was a 'Cloverleaf Industries', you know....
","This is a terrifically entertaining film, a landmark of its type.  For one, it actually features Disney and Warners cartoon characters in the same scenes. For another, it never misses a beat; as the audience of all ages is thrilled by the live action/animation sequences, WFRR slips out of fantasy and intobarely-disguised historical fact to tell an allegorized story of the real-life destruction of southern California's Pacific Electric streetcar and interurban railway system by shadowy special interests.  (The reality of what happened is seen in the POV television documentary 'Taken For A Ride'. The corrupt 'Cloverleaf Industries' really did exist in Los Angeles and dozens of other cities as National City Lines.) Yet though that story is told in parable, the story does move quickly, to its happy ending....unlike what really happened.",9,0,0,21 September 1999
Wedding Crashers," I felt my IQ dropping as this dreck progressed . . .
","So you want to know why film attendance is dropping, and what's wrong with the Hollywood product today? This film could offer some answers in any serious study on the topic.Oh, sure, it's still drawing crowds, but I believe it's doing that at the cost of serious filmgoers swearing off any further such efforts towards seeing what Hollywood thinks is funny nowadays. In short, Preston Sturges and Frank Capra this is not.There is some quick-and-snappy frat-boy dialog, okay. Not okay is that it's delivered to Henry Gibson, get it? You know, the stereotypical old guy with a befuddled expression at all the oh-so-hip talk from these modern whippersnappers, or so we're supposed to think? Let's see ... oh, yeah, the brutal beating outside the wedding. Fun-NY! Then there's the Plot 217-B ending, the Big Scene In Church Where Everything Changes. Ho-hum; it was old when 'The Graduate' did it, and much better.Ah, Hollywood, Hollywood, we hardly knew ye ...Two stars.",2,4,7,18 August 2005
The Matrix," Unintentionally-hilarious trash. Is this where sci-fi is headed?
","Lawrence Fishburne mouths unintelligible, cryptic proverbs ... Keanu Reeves gapes back blankly, slackjawed.  Bang, zoom ... the morphing computers, sensing a total absence of continuity, kick in.  Stuff gets blowed up REAL good.  Then it's back to the, uh, story.  More tightlipped pronunciations through clenched teeth, and HOO! HAH! Martial arts! Pow! Thud! Who won? Who knows? There's nary a mark, or even a hair out of place.
Whoops, listen: somebody's got more deep thoughts. 'There is no spoon.' Ah, the audience is awaiting The Truth behind that one. Can you handle The Truth? Well, accepting the award for The Truth, here she comes: The Oracle! A chain-smoking, cookie-baking Sassy Mama! 'Have ... a COOKIE, Nio!'I mean, how can it miss?  This is High Concept, this is Today, this is Now, short-attention-span Y2K box office boffo!  We're talking Sequel City here! 
I rooted for Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, the one actor who acted in this flash-trash celluloid sinkhole) and his Brown Suits. Especially after he compared the principal characters to a virus which consumes and then moves on.  The Robo-Man makes a point.Hey! Wait a minute ... maybe there really IS no spoon!  Maybe that's the POINT!  There isn't one of those, either!  A point, I mean.",3,3,6,1 April 2000
