The Blair Witch Project," I didn't get it.
","I think I understand what the film makers were trying to do, but I don't think they did it. I was interested in the characters. I liked the handling of thedegradation of their personalities and their relationship, but it was hard to suspend my disbelief to the point that I could accept that they (the characters) continued filming their 'adventure.' It was a good try. Interesting try at the style, but I don't think they made it. It might just be me. Maybe I just didn't understand.",5,0,2,19 April 2003
Groundhog Day," One of the all time great movies!
",See this movie over and over again. It gets more brilliant each time.,10,1,3,24 August 1998
Enemy at the Gates," Mediocre fare
","As a war movie, it was a mediocre lost story. As a love story, it wasa mediocre war movie. I hope the book is better.Since I have to keep writing until this comment is at least four lineslong, I am going to continue writing , though I have nothing more tosay about the movie. It was not a particularly good war movie nor aparticularly good love story. (I guess I did have something else tosay about the movie.) It is always fun to see an actor one knowsfrom one movie in another movie. This had 'Evie' from 'TheMummy' as the female lead. Got to see a brief shot of her asswhich looked nice, but was not worth wading through the rest ofthis mediocre film.",5,0,1,14 July 2002
Signs," A bad remake of Night of the Living Dead
","Bad script. Bad story. Incredibly bad casting. Uninteresting special effects. Insultingly stupid ending.Whooda thought: An isolated group, besieged in a farmhouse by monsters.The end is even more insulting. At least Night of the Living Dead has a great ending. Signs has all this religious crap about the dead warning the living about monsters that haven't shown up yet. Damn!Love conquers all. Whooda thought? What a novel idea. ne ever made a movie in which someone's life was saved by eternal love!If you want to see a great movie, see Night of the Living Dead. If you want to see a lousy remake, see Signs.",1,2,3,14 February 2003
