The Blair Witch Project," A Witches Brew
","(+SPOILERS+) Modern day horror story about a trio of college students Heather Donahue Michael Williams and Josh Leonard going into the woods outside of Burkittsville Maryland in October 1994 to do a documentary on the 'Blair Witch'. A ghost that has haunted those woods since the founding of the town of Burkittsville in 1810. Supposedly desecrating an old Indian cemetery in the in the area by building the town there it's felt by the people who live in and around Burkittsville that the 'Blair Witch' is responsible for a number of vicious and unexplained murders. The string of killings started in the late 1800's when five hunters were brutally murdered by the stream at Coffin Rock. The killings continued on intermittently up until the winter of 1940-41 with the murder of seven children at the old man Parr house. The children who were still alive were made to stand in a corner and wait their turn, looking at an empty wall, in order not to see Parr murdered the others. Parr was found to be insane but the people of the town feel that he was possessed by the 'Blair Witch'. The three students drive out into the woods with their van and then take their video and living equipment in backpacks and go hiking out into the eerie forest. Nothing at first really happens to them until they pass by the haunted Coffin Rock. After a nights sleep in their tent the hikers find themselves in what is an old Indian cemetery with a number of rock piles as tombstones all around them. On their way back to their parked van the next night they hear strange noises all around their camp site and when they wake up the next morning they see the rock piles outside as if they were following them. Things become very weird where the three seem to be going around in circles and even worse Mike for some reason throws away the map that Heather had to help them find their way out of the woods. After another harrowing night in the forest the hikers find themselves in an area of the woods with Voodoo like symbols and artifacts all over the trees! Panic starts to set in on the three hikers with Josh, not being able to take it anymore, going crazy and running out into the woods away from the other two hikers. Heather and Mike searching the woods, trying to find Josh, later that night hear faint cries coming from what turns out to be an old abandon house,The old Parr house?,in the woods. Mike going in first goes room to room trying to find Josh and finally realizes that the cries are coming from the basement and runs down there, just as the cries started they all of a sudden stop. Heather screaming for Mike and Josh to answer her also runs down to the basement and then all we see from her video camera is Mike standing in the corner looking into a blank wall, like the children who were killed at the old man Parr house some sixty years ago! Terrified with fear we hear Heather give out an ear splitting cry and the camera falls out of her hand! All we can see from what the video camera recorded is an empty ceiling! Heather Mike and Josh were never seen or heard from again and all that was left of them was the video tapes that they made of their expedition in the woods that made up the movie 'The Blair Witch Project'. 'The Blair Witch Project' is a lot like the movies directed by the late Jacques Tourneur like 'Cat People' in 1942 and 'The Leopard Man' in 1943 and later 'The Curse of the Demon' in 1957. Tourneur used lights and sounds and shadows to scare the wits out of his audiences not special effects that were so used to seeing in horror movies now. The the film has over 3,000 IMDb users comment on it as well as taking in over $140 million in domestic ticket sales during it initial release in the summer of 1999 shows the tremendous effect that it had on those who saw it. These two facts, among many others, shows that 'The Blair Witch Project' made an impact on the movie going public far bigger than many of it's detractors would like us to believe.",7,2,4,28 April 2004
Vertigo," Blond Obsession
","****SPOILERS**** Chasing a burglar across a San Francisco rooftop Det. John 'Scottie' Ferguson, James Stewart, lost his footing and ended up hanging on for dear life on a roof drainpipe. With his partner SFPD officer Fred Graham desperately trying to save Scottie he slips and falls to his death on the street some ten floors below. It's after that traumatic experience Scottie developed a sever case of acute acrophobia or vertigo, fear of heights, that had him put in his papers and retire from the San Francisco Police Department.Not working with nothing really to do with his time but chit-chat with his ex-fianc√©e artist Midge Wood, Barbara Bel Gredds, Scottie is delighted to be contacted by an old friend Calvin Elster, Tom Helmore. Elster is a big shipping operator on the San Francisco docks who want's Scottie to do a 'job' for him. The 'job' Elster wants is for Scottie to shadow his somewhat whacked out, but gorgeous,wife icy blond Medeleine, Kim Novak. Medeleine it turns out has gone completely off the deep end with her thinking that she's actually, or the reincarnation of, Corlotta Veldes. Corletta who killed herself at the age of 26 in 1857 was the same age that Medeleine is now in 1957! Elster feels that his wife is on the road to do the same thing that Corltta did a century ago; commit suicide!As soon as Scottie laid his eyes on the super sexy Medeleine his heart ended up stuck in his throat. Mesmerized by her beauty Scottie helplessly falls heads over heels for Medeleine despite the fact she's not only married but married to his friend and the person who hired Scottie to follow her Gavin Elster!This somewhat ticklish and uncomfortable situation gets even stranger when Scottie is forced to blow his cover in rescuing Medeleine when she, without warning, jumps into San Francisco Bay just under the Golden Gate Bridge! Having Medeleine dry out at his apartment Scottie, seeing her up close and personal, becomes completely nuts over Medeleine! Within minutes Scottie is more then willing to commit sin, having an affair with a married woman, and steal Medeleine away from his best friend Gavin Elster! The same guy who hired Scottie to look after Medeleine and keep her, like she just tried, from killing herself!***SPOILER ALERT FROM THIS POINT ON*** Things get even stranger for Scottie when Medeleine does what he was hired by her husband to prevent her from doing commit suicide. This happens when Medeleine in what seems like a panic attack runs up the steps of the bell-tower of an old Spanish abbey, when Corlotta did herself in back in 1857, and jumped to her death! With Scottie unable to save Medeleine, due to his fear of heights, he now goes into a deep depression in that he holds himself responsible for not only his police partners, Fred Graham, but his lovers, Medeleine Elster, death as well.Cleared by a court of inquiry in Medeleine tragic suicide Scottie, still holding himself responsible, becomes almost a recluse to his friends, which are very few, as well as society at large. Walking the streets of San Franisco aimlessly one day Scottie sees this pretty read-head, Judy Barton, who eerily looks exactly, with the exception of her hair color, like his departed lover Medeleine Elster!The not that surprise of a surprise ending in 'Vertigo' has Scottie, who by then had put all the missing pieces together, screw up big time by blowing his chance to renew his love affair, through Judy Barton, with the late Medeleine Elster. Obsessed to the point of being arrested and put in a mental ward for both observation and preventing him from both hurting himself or anybody else Scottie really loses it in the end. The bad news in the movie is that Scottie loses his chance to put his past behind him in what he did, or thought he did, in having Medeleine driven to kill herself. The good news is that Scottie in his mindless actions at the end of the movie did in fact put himself through his own kind of unique and very needed 'Shock Treatment'. It was that self administrated 'Shock Treatment' what in the end finally cured Scottie of his Vertigo!",7,1,3,8 February 2008
Changeling," Changeling: A child secretly exchanged for another
","(There are Spoilers) Coming home from work at the L.A Telephone Company, where she's a supervisor, Christine Collins, Angelina Jolie, finds that her nine year old son Water, Gaittin Griffith, had gone missing. Going to the police to file a missing persons report Christine runs into the first of many horrors she suffers throughout the film in the police's indifference to finding her son Walter. It's when the police finally locate Walter some five months later in a diner at far off DeKalb Illinois that Christine's problems, instead of ending, star to intensify. The boy isn't her missing son Walter and what's more the L.A police-who took the credit in locating and returning 'Walter' to her-in wanting to finally close the case insist that he is! So much so that they have Christine committed to an insane asylum when she refuses to go along with them!True story about the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders committed by the deranged Gordon Northcott, Jason Butler Hanner,back in 1928 that stunned the entire nation. The person who unknowingly uncovered these ghastly ax murders-Christine Collins-almost ended up being committed for life in an insane asylum by the very police who's job it was to solve them. It was when L.A Det. Lester Ybarra, Michael Kelly, interviewed this 15 year-old Canadian runaway Sandford Clark, Eddie Anderson, that the truth-about the ax murders- finally saw he light of day. It was Sandford who identified a photo of Walter Collins as one of his crazed Uncle Gordon's victims that cracked the case wide open. Uncovering the victims, as many as 20, at the Northcott Ranch not only leads to the arrest of Gordon Northcott but the indictment of the L.A police in their total incompetence in not chasing down the clues,in the case of the missing Walter Collins, that may have prevent any more murders from happening.****SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT DOWN**** Besides the tragic story about the missing Walter Collins-who in fact was never found dead or alive- and what his mother Christine went through to find him the 'Changeling' also shows the amount of corruption that existed in the LAPD back then and how it allowed, with the police participating in it, crime to get out of hand in the 'City of Angels'. Gordon Northcott who was sentenced to be executed at San Quentin Prison was still up to his old tricks when he, from his cell in solitary confinement, sent Christine a telegram expressing remorse for his crimes and willing to tell her if her son Walter was in fact one of his victims. This lead to one of the most explosive scenes in the entire movie with Christine, while visiting him in a holding cell with a prison guard present, smacked Northcott silly when she realized that he was, by pulling her leg in what he knew about Walter, just extending her suffering for his own sick and perverted pleasure! As for Northcott he was to meet his maker the very next morning, on the San Quentin gallows, and that, unlike his sickening game of cat and mouse he played with Christine the previous day, was nothing for him to laugh about!",7,2,3,18 March 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Something about life that you won't learn in school or college
","***SPOILER ALERT*** Dark and gruesome but at the same time extremely realistic movie about the use and addiction to drugs both legal and illegal and the tragic results to those involved. The movie 'Requiem for a Dream' doesn't take place in the ghettos of the inner cities that we're used to seeing stories like this but in the middle-class and mostly Jewish neighborhood of Conley Island in Brooklyn NY. The story of 'Requiem for a Dream' centers around four people, Sara, Eilen Byrson, her son Harry, Jared Leto, his girlfriend Marion, Jennifer Connelly, and Harry's best friend Tyrone, Marlon Wayans. Sara lives by herself with her son Harry in a high rise apartment in Conley Island. Widowed she watches TV and wants to be a contestant on a show that she loves but feels that she's too heavy and not attractive looking enough to be on TV and have all her friends see her. Sara's son Harry is a local neighborhood hustler who steals TV's or whatever else he can get his hands on to make some money to get himself through the day. Harry's girlfriend Marion seems to come from a good family but she's in love with Harry and as we all know that 'Love is Blind'. Marion doesn't seem to care what Harry is doing and where he might well end up, she just want's to be with him, and feels that they both together will somehow make a go of their lives because Harry has a good mind for business and will work himself up the ladder at whatever vocation he takes up. One day Harry's best friend Tayrone comes up with an idea that they can all make lot's of money by selling drugs and that he has a connection that will get them started in the venture. Meanwhile Harry's mom Sara gets a reply to an application that she sent to the TV show that she watches all day and night that she's been accepted to be on the show as a contestant. Sara starts trying to lose weigh by taking pills that she buys over the counter or what her doctor prescribes to her and in no time all she becomes addicted to them. Harry Tyrone as well as Marion at first are making big money in their drug business but after a while with the threat of the police as well as other rivals drug dealers, and not to mention the addicts that they deal with, their drug business starts to dry up. Before long all three like most drug dealers also become addicted to the very drugs that they were selling.Darren Aronosfsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' is one of the most depressing as well as realistic movies about urban life in regards to drug addiction that's ever been filmed. I have to remind the readers that it takes a very strong stomach to be able to sit through and watch the movie. In the end we see what drugs can do the the human mind body and spirit and it isn't very pretty. Hollywood has come a long way in the making of movies about drug addiction since the Frank Sinatra Film 'Man with the Golden Arm' back in 1955. 'Requiem for a Dream' is a movie everyone should see regardless of it's really disturbing bleak and down right pit-in-hell ending. If it were made back in 1955 when 'Man with the Golden Arm' was released and if millions of people saw it back then the drug problems of today would be a hell of a lot smaller.",9,1,2,27 September 2003
Source Code," 8 minutes to blast off!
","***SPOILERS*** Finding himself on a commuter train heading for Chicago US Army helicopter pilot Capt. Colter Stevens, Jack Gyllenhaal,is a bit confused in him sitting next to pretty and adoring Christina Warren, Michelle Monaghan, who's talking all kinds of mombo-jumbo talk, about the course of human existence, to him which he has absolutely no idea about! Not knowing what to do or say Colter, whom Michelle refers to as her guru and teacher in Far Eastern psychic studies Sean Fentress, gets up and goes to the train's washroom to get his thoughts together when all of a sudden a bomb explodes that ends up killing everyone on the train!As if waking up from a nightmare Colter then finds himself in a sealed capsule being communicated with by US Army Captain Colrleen Goodwin, Vera Farmiga, who tells a shocked and confused Colter that he's in fact dead killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan two months ago! Goodwin tells Colter that his brain has been kept active in order to put him on a super secret mission that he's not expected to come out alive from! Since he's not really alive, Colter is on life-support, to being with in the first place that fact doesn't seem to bother him! This mission that he's in no condition to reject is to become Sean Fentress and prevent the detonation of a nuclear device in downtown Chicago. The train that Colter is on now he's told by Goodwin and her boss Dr. Rutledge, Jeffery Wright, is already gone together with the some 200 or so passengers on it! But Colter is given a window of opportunity to prevent that, the future Chicago nuclear explosion, from happening by him discovering and preventing the man who's to set it off in him using the train explosion as a diversion: An 8 minute time loop that was invented by the super secret project 'Beleaguered Castle' that both Capt. Goodwin & Dr. Rutledge work for. Taking advantage of the time loop Colter can relive those critical 8 minutes as many times as he want's until he finally gets it right! In that way Colter can find out who placed the bomb on the train and thus prevent him from doing far greater damage in nuking the entire city of Chicago and end up killing hundreds of thousands if not as much as a million innocent people!A real mind blowing like movie with Captain Colter Stevens going back and forth in time,the 8 minute time loop, about a half dozen times in order to find out who's responsible for the train explosion only to end up falling in love with Michelle and not only wanting to prevent the nuclear blast that's to level Chicago in the future but prevent the train explosion that already happened that ended up killing her! Being told by Capt.Goodwin & Dr. Rutledge that he can't change what already happened Colter still tries his best to do exactly that.****SPOILERS**** To paraphrase a quote from a famous 1960's sci-fi TV series Colter in his determination to both go back and forth in time and change the outcome of both past and future events in the end ended up succeeding on both counts! What Colter in fact ended up doing was to participate in a great mind as well as time bending adventure. An experience of psychic phenomena that reached from the depths of his innermost mind to the very other limits of physical reality!",8,0,1,7 August 2011
The Ring," Ring a Ding Ding
","***SPOILERS*** At first I thought that 'The Ring' was the telephone ringing right after one watched this crazy video tape about trees deep water wells a fly in the ointment and finally a desolate island with this strange looking woman and lighthouse with only a ladder and chair in it! All taped in grainy black and white. It came as a complete shock to me when it was reviled in the movie that anyone who watched this mind bogging tape would die in exactly seven days! I thought that anyone who was able to sit through the whole God awful video tape would have died a whole lot sooner!It's after her niece Katie, Amber Tamlyn, suddenly died of fright seven days after she saw the tape that Seattle newspaper investigative reporter Rachel Keller, Naomi Watts, decided to check what was the cause of Katie's mysterious death. As things turn out not only does Rachel track down the strange killer tape, at the country motel where Katie spent the weekend with her friends, but also ends up watching it! What made things even worse is that Rachel's six year old son Adian, David Drofman, saw the tape as well without his mother knowing about it. This set the stage for Rachel, after finding out that the tape can actually kill anyone who watched it, together with her live-in boyfriend and Aidan's father Noah, Martin Henderson, attempt to somehow find out how to prevent the tape from not only killing Aidan but also Rachel as well as Noah who, you guessed it, also saw the tape! The movie 'The Ring' never fully explains why this weirdo video-tape has this strange power to kill anyone who takes the time to watch it! We get this half-ass story that it had something to do with the creepy Morgan family who were champion horse breeders and lived on the island depicted in the video-tape. Anna Morgan, Shannon Cochran, the strange woman in the tape is shown killing herself by jumping off a cliff on the island. Anna's even stranger daughter Samara, Daveigh Chase, the person who the video-tape seemed to be all about seems to have had completely vanished into thin air after the tape was finished. It's old man Richrd Morgan, Brian Cox, the only surviving member of the Morgan clan who seems to be the only person in the movie who knows the secret of what this off-the-wall tape is really all about. But with him being tracked down and unmercifully harassed by Rachel into having him reveal the tape's secrets he just flips out and and ended it all in grand fashion. Richard goes out in a blaze of glory by electrocuting himself with some 20,000 volts of electricity using his overflowing bathtub as the electric volts powerful grounded conductor!***SPOILER**** The movie starts to fall apart as it slowly, and I mean Slowly, lumbers on to it's shocking as well as brainless conclusion. It's then that everything goes to pieces when the long dead, it turned out that she was murdered, Samara comes back to life in both the bottom of a 150 foot empty well as well as in, and out, of Noah's TV set! By the time the film is finally over you begin to realize that not only you but those who made it have absolutely no idea what its supposed to be all about!P.S 'The Ring' seems to have copied, even though its based on the recent Japanese horror thriller 'Riongu', from the 1983 David Cronenberg Sci-Fi classic 'Videodrome'. The big difference between the two movies is that 'Videodrome' despite it's complicated storyline was both thought-provoking as well as entertaining where as 'The Ring' never even managed to get off the ground!",5,1,4,6 November 2009
Chinatown," The day the dam broke
","(There are Spoilers) It's Los Angeles 1937 where there's a major controversy over a dam being built outside of city limits. The dam is to divert precious water from the valley that will in effect drive the farmers there into bankruptcy and foreclosure of their homes and farmland.Private Eye J.J Jake Gittes, Jack Nicholson, unknowingly gets involved with this water scheme by being contacted by this woman, Diane Ladd, claiming to be the wife of L.A's Power & Water Commissioner Hollis I. Mulwary, Darrell Zwerling. Claiming that her husband is cheating on her 'Mrs. Evelyn Mulwary' has Gittes get the goods on him by photographing Mr. Mulwary with this young woman,Belinda Palmer, with the photos ending up in the local papers. It's later when Gittes is contacted by the real Mrs. Evelyn Mulwary, Faye Dunnaway, that he realizes that he's been taken for a sucker by whoever this woman the fake Mrs. Mulwary, who turned out to be a Mrs. Ida Sessions, is and the person who hired her!'Chinatown' then has a number of surprises hit both PI Gittes and its audience in that Mrs. Mulwary is the estranged daughter of L.A power broker Noah Cross, John Huston. Cross made his millions in real estate and land development with the help of Hollis Mulwary his son-in-law. It's not long after that Mr. Mulwary ends up dead in the L.A reservoir with the L.A coroner concluding that his death was either an accident or suicide!Gittes knowing that Mr. Mulwary was actually murdered in that he opposed Cross' plan to build a dam that will in fact threaten the people, mostly farmers, who live around it goes out of his way to find out who in fact did murder Mr. Mulwary. Gittes suspicions are confirmed in the fact that Mr. Mulwary's lungs were filled with salt water making it impossible that he drowned in the fresh water L.A reservoir.the kicker to this whole shady project, the building of the dam, is soon discovered, with the help of Mrs. Sessions, by PI Gittes in that Cross and his stooges in the L.A City government are buying up the land that's to be irrigated by the dam dirt cheap from the hard pressed farmers. With a bill later in the year to be voted on by the people of L.A, that's sure to pass, the valley will become part of Los Angeles proper and be worth some 30 million dollars! A fraction of what Cross & Co. bought it for!The crooked land deal angle of 'Chinatown' is really secondary to what the real deal in the movie is and that has to do with the mysterious young woman whom the late Mr. Hollis Mulwary was involved with. It's that young woman that's been kept secret by both Mr. Cross and his daughter Evelyn Mulwary from PI Gittes. In the end she's the reason for both Cross & Evelyn's strange and unnatural actions in the film. That's until her true identity is revealed at the conclusion of the movie which just about blew Gittes mind!Dark and suspenseful film noir with Jack Nicholson at his best as PI Gittes finding out that he bit off far more the he can chew in taking on the powerful and at the same time degenerate Noah Cross. Gittes should have known better that he just can't win in his fight with Cross and the people that he controlled,that included the entire LAPD. It was Gittes' cockiness in that he could derail Cross' plan that lead to the tragedy at the end of the movie that took place in the Chinatown section of L.A.Director Roman Polaski beside making one of the classic film noir films of the post WWII Hollywood era also had a cameo appearance in the movie paying one of Cross' knife wielding hoods. Polanski was the person who sliced open Gittes nose having him go through almost the entire movie with a massive bandage on his face. That bandage, covering almost half his face, was a tempting target for anyone who got psychically involved, like the farmers in the valley, with him in the movie.",8,1,3,3 January 2008
The Fan," I'm as serious as a heart attack
","***SPOILERS*** Robert De Niro is at his deranged and psychotic best as the crazed baseball fanatic or fan for short Gil Renard a man completely whacked out of his skull. It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball.Gil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations.It's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth!***SPOILERS*** The movie 'The Fan' is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was.The ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in 'Cape Fear' some six years earlier.",7,7,9,6 January 2012
12 Angry Men," High drama in a New York City courtroom with a man's life hanging in the balance
","***SPOILERS*** Given what at first glance seems to be an open and shut case by The State of New York vrs George Savoca in the murder, by Mr. Savoca stabbing, of his father. As the foreman of the Jury juror #1 Martin Balsam takes a vote from the 12 jurors including himself he gets an 11 to 1 vote for the conviction of Mr. Savoca. The lone dissenter is Juror #8 Henry Fonda who wants the defendant, who if convicted automatically gets the death penalty,to at least have his case reviewed and debated before he and the rest of the Jurors make a decision that may very well cost Mr. Savoca his life. At first the debate goes nowhere until it becomes clear that the switchblade that Savoca was accused of using to murdered his father was not that unique. The fact that Juror #8 produced an exact same switchblade that he bought in a store some two blocks from the Savoca's home changed all that. Slowly one after another the men on the jury change their vote with Juror #9 and #5 Joseph Sweeney and Jack Klugman being the first two to change their vote from conviction to acquittal. The entire murder case hinged on the two eye witnesses, a lame old man and a near-sighted middle-aged woman, to the murder who lived across the street from the building where the murder was committed. The witnesses testimony was taken apart by both juror #8 and #9 when it was discovered that the old man couldn't have gotten, as he testified at the murder trial, as fast to the window to see the murder committed. As for the woman who was asleep, the murder was committed after midnight, she could not have gotten out of bed and seen, from some 60 feet away, through the windows of a passing fast moving subway train the killing without having her glasses on. The film '12 angry Men' ends with the only holdout of the jurors to acquit Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb breaking down and finally voting to acquit Mr. Savoca. Fine courtroom drama that is as thought-provoking now as it was back then on the screen in 1957 with every one involved giving Academy Award caliber performances even though there were a number of factors that were overlooked by the jurors that may well have proved Mr. Savoca guilt. The knife that killed Savoca's, the same kind of knife that Savoca said that he had but lost the night of the murder, father was found on the street outside his apartment. Even though Juror #8 bought an exact copy of the switchblade knife, that Savoca was said to have used, in a store not far from him home it still didn't prove his innocence. The fact that Savoca couldn't explain where he was convincingly the time that his father was murdered, he claimed he was in a movie-house where no one working there or any customer could identify him. Being the one and only suspect in his fathers murder with a motive to boot, he got into a fierce fight with his father and said that he was going to kill him a few hours before Savoca's father was murdered. It was the eye witness testimony that failed to convince the jurors that had them vote to acquit him. As convincing as the movie was in the jury acquitting Savoca in real life the jury would have in all probability have ended up by not coming to a verdict and ending up a hung jury. Two of the jurors #10 and #7 Ed Begley, Sr. and Jack Warden were more or less motivated to vote for acquittal by being intimidated and pressured by their fellow jurors then by the testimony. Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb was so unstable and emotionally screwed up that it's a wonder that he ever got on the jury in the first place unless he was such a good actor that he fooled the State prosecutor when he was paneled by him.",8,1,3,18 November 2004
Ed Wood," I will perfect my own race of people! A race of Atomic Supermen that will conquer the Woooorrrrrlllld!
","Tragic story of a great genius who was born way before his time and who's time came after he sadly left us. Like Franz Kafka and Vincent Van Gogh Ed Wood, Johnny Depp, was never recognized as the genius that he was until he had to die and then be discovered by millions of film lovers. People who for the most part were born long after he wrote directed and starred in his last film.Following his life long dream of making movies Ed Wood started out as man with ideas that were just to far out for anyone in the Hollywood of the early 1950's to take seriously. It was in 1952 when Ed saw a story in the newspapers about former combat veteran Chris Jorgenson having a sex change operation that got him interested. Ed, being a closet transvestite, decided to do a movie about Jorgenso and secretly about himself. Going from studio to studio all Ed got was the run around and door slammed, or laugh at, in his face. It wasn't until he ran into washed up movie horror king Bela Lugosi ,Martin Laundau, fitting himself for a coffin at a L.A funeral home that things started to turn around for the young and hungry director.The movie 'Ed Wood' centers around the friendship that was developed by Ed Wood and, at the time, the highly morphine addicted Bela Lugosi. Bela who hadn't made a movie in four years was now on his last legs and it was Ed who gave him the chance to revived his career which he did in three unforgettable films that Wood directed: 1.'Glen or Glenda' 2. 'Bride of the Monster' and 3. In a cameo role in what many people consider to be Wood's 'Citizan Kane' the film that they broke the mold after he made it 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'.Were also introduced in 'Ed Wood' to Ed's two wives Doloros Fuller, Sarah Jessica Parker, who left Ed when he gave her a supporting, not leading, role in his classic 'Bride of the Monster' and also Kathy O'Hara, Patricia Arquette, who met Ed when he was at the hospital having his friend Bela dry out and kick his drug habit. Kathy turned out to be Ed's real and true love of his life who, unlike Dolores, stood by him through thick and thin and never left his side up until he suddenly collapsed and died from a heart-attack on the evening of December 10, 1978.Having his first big success with 'Glen and Glenda' in 1953 Ed set out to do films that would give his friend Bela Lugosi, who was the puppet master in that film, something to really stick his teeth into and came up with 'Bride of the Monster' in 1954. Getting together a number of aspiring actors and actresses, like Tony McCoy Loretta King & 400 pound ex professional wrestler Tor Johnson, to play in the movie it took almost a year until Ed could get the money to finally finish the project.'Bride of the Monster' was not the smashing success, financially not artistically, that Ed hoped it would be but watching it now, like those who were lucky or brave enough to see it back then in 1955,it really stood the test of time after all these years. Seeing the great Bela Lugosi in what turned out to be his last speaking role and very possibly the signature performance of his career, as the insane and at the same time sympathetic Dr. Eric Vornoff, that's filled with so much tension electricity and passion that it completely blows away anyone who watches it. Bela delivering his unforgettable 'I Have'a no Home' speech to his bitter rival in the movie Professor Strowski has to be seen, and heard, to be believed. Not to take anything away from actor Martin Landau, who received a Academy Award for his part as Bela Lugosi, you have to see Bela himself deliver he lines in the movie 'Bride of the Monster' to really appreciate what a great actor he really was and, with Ed Wood's writing and directing, again became in the twilight of his magnificent film career. Even Marlon Brando at his absolute best couldn't come close to duplicate Bela's unbelievable performance in that movie!With no worlds left to conquer after classics like 'Bride of the Monster' 'jailbate' ' The Violent Years' and 'Glen or Glenda' already in the can Ed went out to make the movie that he would forever be identified with 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Sadly enough he wouldn't have Bela Lugosi, who died just as the filming began, to star in it. Touching funny as well as heart-breaking story of the Great Ed Wood Jr who had to die, after being laughed snickered and scorned at while he was still alive, to be recognized and become the film and movie genius that he is today. The movie wisely ends just as Ed has his greatest success at the opening of his forgotten, and now rediscovered, anti-war and anti-nuclear testing sci-fi classic 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. It was fitting to end the movie 'Ed Wood' before we saw him, and his great talents, go downhill leaving him a broken and forgotten man who was left to sneaking out of one apartment and into another to prevent himself from being thrown out for not paying his rent. It's even sadder that Ed Wood didn't live long enough to get the appreciation that he so rightfully deserved to get from the movie going public. If there is a life beyond death I can see Ed there now looking down and basking in the love and critical acclaim, from both the public and critics, that he's getting now in death that eluded him all those years in Hollywood where he slaved and grabbed to get his movies made and distributed while he was still alive.",8,1,1,17 June 2007
Orphan," I guess I'm just different?
","**SPOILERS** After her newborn child-who was to be named Jeniffer-died during a failed delivery at the hospital the mother Kate Coleman, Vera Farmia, went into a deep depression and started to hit the bottle.It's now two years later and both Kate an her husband John, Peter Sarsgaard, adopt nine year-old Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman, from a local Catholic orphanage in the hope she'll replaced Jenniffer; The daughter that they never had the chance of knowing. As things were to turn out this was to become a big big mistake on the part of the unsuspecting Colemans! Esther was not what she at first seemed to be but it would take a number of horrific incidents for the Coleman's to finally realize it! But by them it may well have been to late for them and their two young children the deft and mute Maxine, Aryana Engineer, and Danny, Jimmy Bennett, as well as anyone else who just happened to get in Esther's way! Including the Sister Superior of the orphanage that Esther came from Sister Abigal,CCH Pounder.Even though the film is compared to 'The Omem' and 'the Bad Seed' it's really a one of a kind horror flick where you don't realize-like in the previous two child horror films-what's behind sweet little Esther's horrid actions! That's until the shocking secret of her past is reviled, from far off Estonia no less, to the audience as well as Kate that comes to light in the last ten or so minutes left in the movie!***SPOILER ALERT*** There's something very strange about Esther and you notice it almost as soon as you, and the Coleman's, meet her at the orphanage! She's pretty smart even, when she wants to be, adoring but there's something very unnerving about her in how unusually mature, both in knowledge and emotion, she is for nine year-old girl. That something is what Esther has been keeping under raps, or better yet ribbons, all throughout the movie! It's a little something that she took with her out for her home in Estonia, not Russia like she has people think, that will reveal the true nature of her character as well as mental state!Extremely disturbing movie that has as it's villain, little Esther, one of the most cold blooded and manipulative psycho killers in motion picture history! It's not that Esther is at first a sweet and innocent-looking child. It's that she's just too perfect in both committing and covering up the horrors that she perpetrates in the film! Like she's had from previous experience in doing these same horrible acts before!It's Kate who starts to put the missing pieces of the puzzle together in just who Esther really is and how she's been so successful in covering up her past! A cover-up that even fooled Esther's, or the Coleman family, psychiatrist Dr Browning, Margo Mantindale. It's later when Esther tries to silence Kate, by having her declared insane or murdered, that even her very naive husband John finally realizes just what he's up against! Something or someone that he, and almost every one else in the film, had been completely fooled by! But with John now totally out of it, by Esther getting him drunk, and coming face to face with this unspeakable horror he is in no condition to fight it!",7,2,4,7 August 2009
L.A. Confidential," Hold up your badge so they'll know your a policeman
","***SPOILERS**** With big time L.A hoodlum Mickey Cohen, Paul Guilfoyle, sent up the river in a federal penitentiary on a tax-evasion rap a vacuum had been created in the city's organized crime hierarchy. Hoodlums descend on L.A, like a hoard of locusts, from all over the country in order to fill it. The L.A police Department has the head of the organized crime task force Capt.Dudley, James Cromwell, given the assignment to keep the city from having another Mickey Cohen take over the mob. Capt. Dudley does it with both 'swift and merciless' justice in many cases not caring a lick about the law ,that he was sworn to uphold, to do it.Hard and brutal movie about a brutal time post-war L.A. With the city trying to clean up it's shoddy image by having, among other things, a Dragnet-like TV show 'Badge of Honor' with L.A cop Det. Sgt. Jack Vincennes, Kevin Spacey, as the shows technical adviser. 'Badge of Honor' shows how efficient and honest the city's cops are where at the same time in real life L.A has one of the worst records of police corruption of all the major cities in the United States. An epidemic of corruption that reaches into the very highest echelons of the city government and the District Attorneys office.Straight as an arrow cop, one of the very few on the force, Det. Ed Exley, Guy Pearnce, gets a call at the local precinct about a robbery at the Nite Owl Diner. With no one available he answers the call himself by driving over to see what he could do. What Exley didn't know at the time was that he would get caught up in not only a mass murder but a cover up of the killings. That cover up would go straight up to the LAPD office that's in charge of combating organized crime headed by the very highly decorated and greatly admired Capt. Dudley.The film 'L.A Confidential' has both the clean cut and soft spoken Det. Exley and his rival on the force the brutal and Neanderthal-like Officer Bud White, Russell Crowe, end up working together to crack the Nite Owl murder case. This even after it was solved with Det. Exley getting all the credit and a promotion in solving it. White and Exley who had no use or love for each other slowly came to the realization that they were both being manipulated by forces beyond their control. With big time pimp and highly successful L.A businessman Pirice Patchett, David Stratharin, being one of those pulling the strings.Patchett running a high-class call girl operation called Fleur-de-lis has his hookers made to look like movie stars. One of them ended up among those murdered at the Nite Owl a Rita Heyworth-look alike named Susan Lefferts, Amber Smith. Also among the dead at the now-infamous eatery was Det.Sgt. Dick Stensland, Graham Beckel. Sgt. Stensland used to be Officer White's partner before he was drummed out of the department for abusing prisoners in his custody.Pinning the Nite Owl killings on a trio of inner city hoodlum Sugar Ray Cullins, Jeremiah Birkett, and his two partners in crime Louis Fontaine & Ty Jones, Salim Grant & Kareem Washington, had the case just about solved. Later with the three accused murderers escaping from the precinct lock-up and ending up shot and killed by the perusing cops, which included the now promoted Det.Let Exley, just about iced the case.It's then that strange things started to happen, with a number of former Mickey Cohen associates getting rubbed out, that Det. Sgt Vincennes began to check out the deceased and disgraced Det. Sgt. Slensland's record. Vincennes finds a number of cases that he was on back in 1939-41 that has him linked to Capt. Dudly and another drummed out of the department corrupt cop Leland 'Buzz' Meeks,Darrell Sandeen. These decade old cases had to do with getting paid off by the Cohen mob to look the other way on their criminal activities. All this investigating on Det. Sgt. Vinceenes' part eventually lead to his murder.Everything started to crystallized before the Det. Sgt. Vincennes eyes in the mob-LAPD connection that now involves a massive and secret attempt to take over Mickey Cohen's criminal empire. An empire of gambling drugs prostitution and murder for hire,or Murder Inc, by non-other then elements in the LAPD itself! The crooked L.A cops used, when murder would blow their cover, the sleazy and powerful Pierce Patchett and equally squalid Hush-Hush magazine editor Sid Hodges, Danny DeVito, to do their dirty work. This involved Patchett's Fleur-de-lis call girls getting involved, and being photographed,with anyone who's a threat to the corrupt cops operations. One of those blackmail was non-other then the L.A District Attorney Ellis Loew, Ron Rifkin.Penetrating and powerful film with the beautiful Kim Besinger as Veronica Lake-Look alike Lynn Bracken getting involved with both Officer White and Det. Let. Exley. Both cops end up pooling their talents, of brute force and keen brains, to try to break the reign of terror and corruption that infiltrated the LAPD.",9,1,2,28 June 2006
Resident Evil: Extinction," Staying on the road was the only way to stay alive
","**SPOILERS** A lot like the 1981 Mel Gibson apocalyptic auctioneer 'Road Warrior' the movie 'Resident Evil: Extinction' has to do with an experiment gone wrong; terribly wrong. Having mistakenly released the deadly T-Virus out of their main laboratory in Racoon City the Umbrella Cooperation is now trying to find an antidote to it in order to save the last few uninfected human survivors still left. One of the head honcho's of the UC Dr. Isaacs, Lain Glenn, is secretly experimenting with those infected by the T-Virus in order the make them obedient slaves to their masters, the cooperations, when and if a cure is found to keep, if not eradicate, the T-Virus in check.The key to finding a cure for the T-Virus is the now escaped head of security of the UC Alice, Milla Jouovich. Cloning scores of Alices' by Dr. Isaacs have all failed with them being killed, running through a deadly obstacle course, in trying to find out that their a perfect replication of Alice. It's the real Alice that Dr. Isaacs wants and to find her he'll use every means at his disposal to track her down even if it means going against the orders of his superiors at Umbrella Corps.Alice after a close and deadly encounter with a number of flesh-eating virus infected zombies and mutant wild dogs makes her way to this caravan of human survivors in the Nevada Desert. It was while Alice was out on her own she came across a booklet with transcribe radio transmissions from Alaska. The radio transmissions say that Alaska is the only place on earth that the T-Virus hasn't been able to penetrate. Giving this very vital information to the leader of the desert caravan Clair Redfield, Ali Larter, Alice has her decide to travel up north to finally get away from then tens of thousands of flesh eating zombies that roam the now almost totally deserted, of human beings, United States.Exciting run to daylight by the trucks cars and oil-tanker of the, what seems like, last human survivors of the continental US with tens of thousands of zombies either hot on their tail or in their face. Alice & Clair gets the convoy as far as Las Vegas where it ends up being stuck in five to ten feet of loose and shifting desert sands. Forced to make a stand the caravan survivors are almost wiped out by the rampaging and almost unstoppable zombies thirsting for their flesh since, from the looks of them, they haven't eaten in days. Alice saves the day by getting the few survivors out and then together with Carlos, Oden Fehr, runs the gantlet in smashing into the UC main headquarters and experiment center just outside of Vegas.With the remaining survivors safely put on one of the UC helicopters and out of harms way Alice makes her way into the heart of the experiment center. It's there that she finds out what Dr. Isaacs, who had morphed himself into an outer space alien-like monster, had planned to do to both her as well as himself to, in his own unique and insane way, single-handedly take over the world!The films confusing story is saved by its very effective and heart-stopping action scenes. Alice with her both super 9mm automatics and ferocious looking Gurkha bolo's, machetes, is more then a match for the hundreds of wild and screaming zombies that she has no trouble at all putting away. It's only later when Alice confronts the what seemed to be indestructible Dr. Isaacs, looking like the intergalactic stowaway monster in the movie 'Alien', that she finds she has her hands full in trying to take him out. ***SPOILERS**** It turns out that Alice has a friend that the megalomaniac Dr. Issac had completely overlooked in his attempt to both capture and, after he got what he wanted out of Alice, do her in. That friend not only rescues Alice but together with her help will not only put a stop to the rampaging T-Virus but the, what's left of them, top men of the UC; who's mad and self-serving experiments had created it in the first place.",6,1,3,5 May 2008

Ocean's Twelve," Your not making any sense!
","(Some spoilers) More like a private home movie then a major Hollywood studio made motion picture for the movie-going public 'Ocean's 12' doesn't make any sense at all with these dozen or so international super crooks.The crooks are seen jet-setting all over the capitals of Europe in an attempt to steal up to 160 million dollars. This is all done in a number of elaborate heists to pay off big time US hoodlum and owner of the Bellaslo Casino, who these same crooks ripped off, Terry Benedict, Andy Garcia.As if he were all knowing and omnipresent Benedict pops up all over the country in the strangest of places to surprise all the hoods involved in the robbery of his casino some three years ago. Telling the former crooks that if they don't come up with his money plus interest within two weeks they'll be as dead and buried as last years turnip crop.We have the happy go lucky robbers led by Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan,George Clooney & Brad Pitt, go to Amsterdam to begin their scavenger hunt for Benidict's stolen millions by stealing tens of millions from others. For some reason the USA was too dangerous for them even though they've live there with all their ill-gotten loot for the last three years without having any fear of being arrested by the police. In Amsterdam we soon learn the real reason for Benedict's unusual actions? Benedict seemed uninterested about getting his money back all these years but why all of a sudden is he now? This super-duper crook Francois Touolur,Vicent Cassel, also known as the 'Night Fox' want's to pit his wits and robbing skills and abilities against the crack Ocean 12 crew. Touolur wants to prove to them that he's the biggest baddest and best crook of them all. We also learn that it was Touolur who tipped off Benedict on the Danny Ocean's crews whereabouts to get them to come out of hiding, or retirement, to meet his challenge. The film 'Ocean's 12' get's more and more confusing as it goes along with hot-shot and pretty Interpole agent Isabel Lahiri, Catherine Zeta-Jones, joining in on the case and single-handedly screws it all up by being taking advantage of and then made to look like a jerk by Rusty & Co. Isabel also learns who her long lost father, who she thought was long dead, is at the end of the movie to the surprise of no one, on the screen or in the audience, but herself. No matter what fixes the Ocean 12 boy's get into they always end up on the winning side with the obnoxious and ridicules 'Night Fox'. The 'Night Fox' ends up looking like the narcissistic and arrogant nitwit, instead of the criminal mastermind, that he really is.The movie reaches the hight of self-mocking when we have Tess Ocean, played by Julia Roberts,impersonate actress Julia Roberts in an effort to have her husband Danny & Co. steal this 'Golden Easter Egg' at the Rome Museum. Who should pop up at the museum but actor Bruce Willis who happens to be doing a movie with the real Julia Roberts in Mexico! You have to give Tess Ocean credit for her acting since she completely fooled Bruce Willis as well as everyone else into believing that she was actually THE Julia Roberts and not Danny Ocean's wife.",5,1,2,26 January 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," We'll Meet Again Don't Know Were Don't Know when
","***SPOILERS**** Even though the movie 'Dr. Strangelove' opens to the romantic and tender music of 'Try A Little Tenderness', as we see a B52 bomber being refiled in mid-air, and ends to the touching and sweet sound of 'We'll Meet Again', as we see the world go up in flames in a series of thermonuclear explosions, there's little or nothing in the film that has to do with either love and romance. Everything in the movie has to do with madness and insanity. Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper, Sterling Hayden, has been obsessed with the thought that the Soviets have been polluting the nations drinking water, through the evil process of fluoridation. Gen. Ripper feels hat the Soviets first ant to corrupt the natural fluids or essences of the American people and then, when thats accomplished, take over the USA without firing a shot. Ordering the 843rd Air Wing, which Gen. Ripper is in command of, on a bombing mission in the USSR the General feels that he has to stop the Soviets for doing any more damage to those vital and precious fluids, that flow through the bodies of the American people, before it's too late. It takes a while for those in the US Government authority, from the president of the United States on down, to realize that Ripper has gone off the deep end but by the time they came to that realization it was too late to stop him. The 34 B52 bombers that he ordered to take off with 50 megatons of nuclear explosives each, are by then well on their way in igniting WWIII. Stanley Kubrick's terrifying 1964 black comedy, made two years after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, based on the little known book 'Red Alert' by Peter George 'Dr. Strangelove' is without a doubt one of the most effective anti-war as well as the most shattering movie about nuclear destruction ever made. When trying to recall the B52 bombers, after they passed their fail-safe points, becomes futile US President Merkin Muffely, Peter Sellers, gets in touch with the Soviet Premiere Damitri Kissoff. Premiere Kissoff who's drunk and partying, in what seems like, a bordello is asked to work together with the USA in shooting down the attacking B52's. This has to be done before they drop their payloads on his country's missile and defense bases. Too drunk and agitated to do anything at first Premiere Kissoff agrees with Pres. Muffley to cooperate. By the time that the US bombers were to strike deep inside Russia all but one were either shot down or recalled. The recall order was discovered by RAF Group Captain Mandrake, again Peter Sellers, who was the British liaison officer at the Brupelson Air Force base. Mandreke discovered and deciphered the order after Gen. Ripper shot himself. Gen. Ripper feared he'd be captured and tortured in order to get the recall code out of him, when the base was overrun by US Airborne troops. It later comes to light that the Soviet Union had developed a 'Dooms-Day Machine' that is set to go off and destroy the entire earth with the force of 50 hydrogen bombs. All that's needed to set it off is for just one nuclear device to be dropped on the Soviet Union! Which the only surviving B52, that hasn't been shot down or recalled, commanded by Major Kong, Slim Pickens, is just about to do! Tense and nail-biting final with everything being done to stop Maj. Kong's B52 bomber from succeeding in it's mission. With Maj. Kong and his crew doing everything to make it succeed. The ending will have you on the brink of a nervous breakdown like it does to everyone on the screen with the possible exception of crippled and mentally unstable Dr. Strangelove, Peter Sellers again for the third time. Dr. Strangelove a former Nazi scientist and now the Pentagon's director of weapons research is really looking forward to this once in a lifetime event. He's so excited by it that he actually gets up from his wheelchair and like he says, in a total state of euphoric hysteria, 'Main FUHRER! I Can VoK!'. With all the great performances in the movie it was George C. Scott's General 'Buck' Turgidson who really stole the show as the pragmatic and at the same time paranoid military man. Gen. Turgidson was always looking ahead first to obliterate the Soviet Union an now that the cats out of the bag, with no chance of stopping the runaway B52's from their mission, try to have the USA control all the worlds mind shafts; in order to survive the impending nuclear holocaust.",10,3,6,18 March 2005
The Doors," When the music' over turn out the light
","***SPOILERS*** The true an tragic story of psychedelic rock music icon Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer, who together with his group 'The Doors' went from the heights of Mt. Olympus to the depths of the Qattara Dpression in less then five years. It was in 1965 when Morrison was attending UCLA Film school that he had a revelation, helped by getting stoned on drugs, in the California Desert that he realized that his true calling was in music not film. Now back in civilization Morrison tried his hand on music and with three of his friends Ray Manzaredk Robbie Krieger & John Densmore, Kyle MacLachian Frank Whaley & Kevin Dillion, formed the rock group 'The Doors' and the rest is rock & roll or hard rock history.It what seemed that like almost overnight Morrison's Doors became the most popular singing group in the US! Even eclipsing 'The Beatles' & 'Rolling Stones' in that they were home grown, born and raised in the USA, unlike their British counterparts. And what's more Jim Morrison & The Doors' music was far more original then any of the English groups. Who for the most part were only singing repackaged 1950's and early 1960's rock & roll bubble-gun music with English accents.It was at the hight of his popularity that Morrison's self-destructive qualities suddenly started to come to the surface. We get to see in the movie how Morrison began to drink and do drugs almost every hour of the day and night as he was preforming both on and off stage. His womanizing didn't help Morrison either in that he ran the risk of being sued in dozen of paternity suites from the women and young girls,as well as their outraged parents, that he engaged with . That lead to his life long woman companion Pamala Courson, Meg Ryan, becoming so depressed over Morrisons affairs, mostly with groupies, that she herself started turning to drugs on an almost daily basis! That ultimately lead to Pamala dying of an heroin overdose in 1974 at age 27. The same age that Morrison passed away from a suspected, no autopsy was preformed on his body, heroin overdose three years earlier!It was in 1969 at a concert in Miami that Morrison burnt out and a shell of his former self finally hit rock bottom and self destructed on stage in front of thousand of his fans. His once trim body bolted from beer & booze as well as being drunk and stoned out of his skull Morrison gave the performance of his life! That lead to his arrest on drug and morals, in exposing himself in public, charges that ended up putting him on ice or out of circulating form almost a year. Still Jim Morrison continued to live the kind of scuzzy and drug addictive life that had even his fellow Door members distance themselves and stopped talking to him. That's until he finally realized that his life won't last long with the damage it was doing to him both physically as well as mentally.In the early summer of 1971 Jim Morrison now trying to get his head back together and turn his already shattered life around traveled to Paris France together with Pamala to either write poetry or paint pictures. It was there that he ended up taking his last breath as well as suspected, but never proved, last mind altering drug trip. Waking up in the early morning of July 3, 1971 Morrison feeling ill and coughing up blood decided to take a hot bath in order to ease the pain. It was there that Pamala found him dead as a doornail a few hours later. Dead from the wild and crazy lifestyle that Jim Morrison lead that both immortalized as well as ended up killing him.P.S Check out the movie's director Oliver Stone as a film professor at the UCLA film school that Jim Morrison attended. There also the famed defense attorney William Kunstler playing himself as Jim Morrison's lawyer at his booze drug & indecent public exposer trail in Miami Florida.",7,1,2,5 September 2011
Elf," The Elf Who Saved Christmas
","(There Are Spoilers) Buddy the Elf, Will Ferrell, never seemed to fit in with his fellow Elfs in Santa's, Edward Anser, workshop at the North Pole. Being a couple of sizes bigger then the Elfs that he lived and worked with at the toy factory Buddy felt out of place and with his overly big hands he was clumsy in making toys as perfectly and delicately as your average Elf. Buddy considered himself to be, to the horror of his fellow Elfs, a 'Cotton-Headed Ninny Muffin'. One day Buddy's dad Papa Elf, Bob Newheart, came clean with the obviously confused Buddy and let the truth come out: Buddy your not an Elf your a Human. Buddy,were told, was left at the steps of an Cathloic Orphanage to be brought up by the Nuns there. One Christman Eve Santa came to town and Buddy slipped into his bag of toys and ended up in the North Pole and was secretly made to think that he's an Elf by Santa Papa Elf and all the Elfs working there. Now with the truth about him and his real dad Walter Hobbs, James Caan, a greedy and unfeeling children's book publisher who's, O' My God, on Santa's naughty list! Buddy crosses the seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest and past the Sea of Twirly Swirly Gumdrops and finally goes through, on foot, the Lincoln Tunnel to the magic city, New York, to finally meet his dad who he never knew up until now. Looked at as 'Some kind of Nut' at first Buddy's good and child-like nature, as well as his belief in the Christmas Spirit and Santa Claus, wins over everyone that he meets. From his dad Walter to his step-mom Emily Hobbs and younger brother Michael, Mary Steenburgen & Daniel Tay,as well as Jovie, Zooey Deschanel, the girl who he worked with as an Elf, what else,at Gimbel's Depertment Store. Through Buddy's skills as a toy maker as well as his all around good nature he made believer's of everyone in New York City that there is a Santa as well as a Christmas Spirit. Buddy did it with a little help from his newly found and made friends who at first didn't believe him and even thought that he was just a wee bit mentally unstable. Heartwarming Christmas Movie with Will Ferrell perfect as Buddy the Elf who saved Christmas with James Cann as his grouchy but later Santa believing dad. Jovie who has a beautiful singing voice but was too stage frighten to sing in front of people, she only could sing in the shower, was so motivated by Buddy's actions to open up her voice in public at New Yorks Central Park, singing a Christmas Carol, where everyone in the park joined in including Buddy's at first apprehensive dad Walter. This gave Santa's sled the power to lift it up above the clouds and fly higher then it did, with the Christmas Spirit that powered Santa's Raindeer driven Sled in everyones singing the Christmas Carol, for years.",8,4,8,26 February 2005

Travis Bickle, Robert De Niro, keeps a diary at home where he records his thoughts as well as his daily experience on and off the streets of New York as he drives a cab to support himself. 'I'm God's lonely man' Travis constantly writes in his diary. Trying to fit into a vast an impersonal city like New York is too much for Travis. He feels more at home by himself with his thoughts and fantasies then socializing with people. In the movie Travis has two relationships. One with a woman the other with a girl, both end up disastrous. The first with Besty, Sybill Shepherd, a campaign worker for presidential candidate Charles Palintine, Lenoard Harris, and the second with Iris, Jody Foster, a 12 year old prostitute who turns tricks for and is looked after by her pimp Sport, Harvey Keitel. Travis spots Besty at the Palintine campaign offices in midtown Manhattan while he's driving his cab and falls in love with her. Travis going so far as to volunteer to work for the Palintine campaign so he can be with her. After a while Travis gets friendly and close enough with Besty to take her out to the movies on a date with him. It turns out that Travis' limited knowledge of the entertainment world, the only movies that Travis watches and knows about are porno flicks, leaves him hurt and humiliated when Besty, shocked that Travis would take her to an X-rated theater, walks out on him.Some time later Travis back on his job driving a cab one night in the East Village encounters Iris trying to run away from her pimp Sport when she jumps into his cab. Sport gets into the cab with Iris and after sweet talking Iris to come back with him gives Travis a twenty dollar bill for all the trouble that Iris caused and tells Travis to forget all about it. Travis soon becomes fixated with rescuing Iris from her life on the streets and from working for Sport for whom Travis begins to develop a very strong and violent dislike of.As the movie slowly moves to it's bloody and explosive conclusion it's obvious that Travis has gone over the deep end. Arming himself to the teeth and getting himself into shape, both physically and mentally, for the battle against all those evil forces that are lurking around him that is sure to come. His frustration together with his ignorance and alienation of the real world has turned Travis, who was friendly and likable if just a bit odd at the beginning of the movie, into a Frankenstein monster. The movie 'Taxi Driver' is filled with academy award caliber acting imaginary and gritty big city photography and a multi-layer story that's easy to follow due to a very skillful job of directing. The movie also has one of the most haunting and memorable musical score that I've ever herd in any movie and it more then deserves all the accolades that it received over all these years. The only bad thing that I can say about 'Taxi driver' is that director Martin Scorsese made the movie too soon in his career. It's been 27 years since Scorsese made the movie 'Taxi Driver' and since then, with all the films that he directed, he's never come close to making any movie as good as it and for all we know he never will. Like Orson Wells in 1941 when he made 'Citizen Kane' that over forty years until his death in 1985 Wells could never do anything on film to top that movie and the only place that Wells could go after he made 'Citizen Kane' was down.",9,1,1,26 September 2003
Shutter Island," Patient # 67
","***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Sent in the fall of 1954 to this far off island off Boston Harbor US Marshall Edward 'Teddy' Daniels, Leonardo DiCairo, is given a new partner Marshall Chuck Aule, Mark Ruffalo, who came to Boston all the way from Seattle Washington. The case that both Marshall Danials & Aule are to investigate is the escape from the island's top security Ashecliffe Mental Hospital, that's run by the US Government, of child murderess of her own three children Rachel Solando,Patrica Clarkson. Both Daniels & Aule run into a number of roadblocks in their investigation in that the person who runs the hospital Dr. John Cawley, Ben Kingsly,and his assistant Dr. Jeremiah Naehring, Max Von Sydow,refuse to cooperate with them in releasing the escapee's, Rachel Solando,personal medical records! In fact as both Daniel's and Aule soon come to realize that this Rachel Solando may not even exist at all!As the film plays itself out is soon becomes evident that it's Marshall Daniels who's suffering from a series of jolting and mind bending flashbacks coupled with migraine headaches who's a candidate to be locked up in Ashecliffe Hopital just as much as the escaped child murderess Rachel Solando is! We get to see Daniels's mind start to work on him in two events in his life that has changed him forever. His involvement in the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp Dachau in the spring of 1945, when he was 22, and what, in the hundreds of dead and emaciated bodies of the camp inmates, he saw there. What was also playing on Daniel's mind is the cold blooded massacre of over 500 unarmed and helpless German Army & SS prisoners at the camp that he participated in! The second and far more personal event in Daniel's life that's been burning him up for the last two years is the death of his wife Dolores, Michelle Williams,who died in an arson fire of the couple's home set by firebug and confirmed psycho Andrew Laddis played by the Robert De Niero looking,looking as if he's DiNero's identical twin, actor Elias Koteas. As we and Daniel's soon find out Laddis,whom he's been tracking down for the last two years, is in fact one of the mental patients at Ashecliffe Hospital!Get yourself ready for a number big surprises as both Marshall's Daniels & Aule uncover a major psych ops operation going on at Ashecliffe Hospital. It seems that Doctor's Cawley & Neahring, by copying what the North Koreans did to helpless US POWS in the Korean War, are using the patients there in a number of drug induced mind altering experiments by turning them into mindless and murderous zombies for the US Government in future,like political assassinations, clandestine operations! But what turns out to be the true reason for why Daniels and Aule were assigned there is far more shocking that even that!***SPOILERS*** One of the best psychological thriller in years that ranks right up there with movies like 'The Manchurian Candidate' and 1956 Kevin McCarthy thriller 'Nightmare' the film 'Sutter Island' will keep you as well as Marshall Daniels & Aule guessing until it reveals the truth about what's really happening in it. The ending of the movie is truly shocking even if you saw it coming miles or minutes in advance! It turns everything that you saw up to that point in the film upside down and even more mind boggling shows who the real villain or villains, as well as good guys or heroes, in the movie really are!",8,0,3,10 June 2012
Full Metal Jacket," Time for some Payback!
","***SPOILERS*** One of the best movies ever made about the Vietnam War or any other war for that matter 'Full Metal Jacket' shows what not only war but boot camp, in preparing one for war, does to young recruits who are exposed to it.At Parris Island the new and raw US Marine recruits are put through the ringer by the foul mouth and in your face US Marine drill Sgt. Hartman played by former Marine DI R.Lee Ermey. Brutal and heartless Sgt.Hartman whips the recruits into shape by making them fear as well as hate him far more then those their trained to kill; The Vietcong, or just plain VC, and North Vietnamese regular combat troops. Sgt. Hartman who for some reason never takes off his drill instructor hat, even while asleep, during the entire time he's in the movie really gets to work on the overweight and dumpy Pvt. Pyle, Vincent D'Onofrio, whom he's determined to turn into a US Marine killing machine even if it ends up killing him; That's Pvt.Pyle not Sgt.Hartmen It's really Pvt. Pyle's good friend and fellow US Marine recruit Pvt. Joker, Matthew Modine, who does the job that Sgt.Hartman failed to do. That's in Pvt. Joker making, by persuading instead of intimidating, Pvt. Pyle into a fearless and murderous US fighting man. But Pvt. Joker soon realizes that he did too good of a job in getting Pvt.Plye into the US Marine killing mode that Sgt.Hartmen tried by failed to get him into! The grueling and dehumanizing training drove the poor young man to completely lose his marbles! And it was Sgt. Hartman, in the marine barracks latrine, who was to find that out soon enough at the receiving end of Pvt. Pyle's M-14 rifle!The second half of the movie 'Full Metal Jacket' is when the real action begins as Pvt. Joker , now a sergeant, is assigned as a US Marine combat reporter for Stars & Strips during the bloodiest fighting of the Vietnam War: The 1968 Tet Offencive. It's during that brutal period that Sgt.Joker is reunited with his fellow marine boot camp buddy Pvt. Cowboy, Arliss Howard, during the battle of Hue in central South Vietnam. It's during the battle of Hue that Sgt.Joker a life long pacifist learns the meaning of kill or be killed. It's in the brutal and bloody assault on a VC sniper nest in a burnt out and abandoned building on the outskirts of Hue that Pvt. Joker sees what war is really all about when he suddenly becomes part of it. Something he'll now have to live with, if in fact he survives the war, for the rest of his life!***SPOILERS*** Brutally honest film about war and it's effects on those who participate in it 'Full Metal Jacket' doesn't at all glorify war and the American fighting man but shows how he becomes the very monster that he's been brainwashed in boot camp to kill: The godless and dirty commie VC & North Vietnamese soldier! In fact the most humane thing to happen in the movie was Sgt. Joker, who was forced by his fellow US Marines, gunning down the Viet Cong woman sniper, Ngoc Le, who by single handedly holding it off had just about decimated his entire US Marine combat unit and killing his good friend and marine buddy Pvt.Cowboy in the process! At first opting to let the fatally injured VC sniper die a slow death, for all the damage she did, the gong ho and blood and guts US Marine Pvt. Animal Mother, Adam Baldwin, for the first time showed his human side in not having to want to put her out of her misery! He wanted her to suffer as much as possible for what she did in killing his fellow US Marines! Animal Mother who didn't think twice in gunning down VC or North Vietnamese soldiers in combat just didn't have it when it came to finishing the helpless and near death VC sniper off! It was up to Pvt. Joker to do the job which in fact the dying sniper was very grateful for in him in doing it!",8,0,0,26 August 2010
The Devil Wears Prada," What does she want you to do? Call the national guard and lift her out of there?
","***SPOILERS*** It's a painful and brain twisting job but someone's got to do it with just journalism graduate from Northern University Andy Sacks, Anne Hathaway, somehow with absolutely no experience at all got stuck with. That in Anna working for the ice cold as the North Pole in the dead of winter and overly demanding battle ax of an editor of the top fashion magazine 'Runway' the not so priestly Miranda Priestly, Meryl Streep.Right away things don't look so good for the poor and inexperienced Anne who just doesn't fit into the operation or the clothes, she's a hefty and non twiggy like size 6, and tote and designer hand bags that Marinda peddles in her magazine. Items that run for as high $1,500.00 for a woman's scarf!Still with a little help from the magazine's head of clothing design Nigel, Stanley Tucci, Anne does make a name for herself at 'Runway Magazine' in outlasting most of her fellow employees who's life or on job expectancy is about as long as a Mayfly in May. For some strange reason the hard bitten and take no prisoners, for having people working for her magazine longer then a week, Marinda took a shine towards Anne and keeps her on her staff. That despite all the messing up she did for her on and off the job. With her star rising in the world of fashion Anne's social life go straight down the tubes. Anne's live in boyfriend Sushi Chef Nate, Adrian Grenier, is turned off in the high flying lifestyle that his girlfriend has gotten herself into never having any time,in being on call to Mirinda 24 hours a day, with him or the wonderful dishes he cooks up for her. She's got to watch her weight and is on a strict sunflower seed and spring water diet. It becomes almost impossible for Anne to keep up with her boss Miranda's unreasonable demands that she's well on the way of suffering a nervous breakdown in trying to keep up with them!***SPOILERS*** The final shoe to drop in Anne's glamorous but torturous job at 'Runway' is when she's promoted to go to Paris for a fashion show that Miranda is throwing at the expense of her good friend and fellow employee at the magazine Emily, Emily Blunt. Knowing just how much Emily wanted that assignment Anne tries her best to persuade Mirdana to give it to Emily instead of herself. With Miranda steadfast in her decision and not giving an inch Anne finally realizes that the job of being her top aid isn't worth it. Something that Anne always seemed to know yet kept hidden from herself. P.S The film showed just how plastic and artificial the lives of the high and mighty in the fashion world really are. Miranda despite all her power and influence couldn't keep her marriage together with the one person,her long suffering husband, whom she showed some genuine feelings for in the movie. Yet he dropped her like a sack of spoiled potatoes when she just got too much, in her constant nagging and complaining about the way he dresses, for him to take. The ice cold and unfeeling front that Miranda put up was just that a front. Which prevented her from showing any kinds of human feelings or emotions which in the end worked against her.",7,0,1,26 October 2012
Rocky II," I'm gonna drop you like a bad habit!
","****SPOILERS**** After the spectacular 15 round World Championship fight against heavyweight champ Appollo Creed, Carl Weathers, that he lost in a unpopular, to almost everyone watching, split decision club fighter Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone, decides to hang up his gloves before he ends up either getting blind or killed in the ring. This doesn't go so well with Creed who's been getting hate mail from his many fans in how a bum like Rocky Balboa could go the distance with him without Creed, in order to build up the gate for a rematch, carrying him for 15 rounds. Finally marrying his sweetheart the former Adrian Pennino, Talia Shire, Rocky tries to use his new found fame, in going the distance with the heavyweight champ, to make a decent living for him and his future, Adrian at the time was expecting, family.As things turned out nothing went right for the Balbo's, Rocky & Adrian, financially with Rocky unable to get a good paying job and Adrian having to get her old job back at the local pet shop that barley paid the couples rent. Laid off from the meat packing plant that his brother-in-law Paulie, Burt Young, got him Rocky now desperate goes back to his old haunts at Mickey Goldwill's, Burgess Meredith, Gym to get back in shape and box for a living; which is about the only thing that Rocky can do well. Mickey reluctant at first to train Rocky in fear that he may end up getting blinded in the ring finally gives in and decides to train him. That's when Creed in an attempt to lure Rocky into a rematch with him starts shooting his mouth off in what a two bit coward he is in not wanting to fight him.In the end it's Adrian who just survived giving birth to Rocky's son, Rocky Jr, who gave her husband the go ahead to fight Creed. That motivated Rocky who was half hearted in his training program to go all out in getting himself in shape for the big rematch between the two on Thanksgiving Day at the Philadelphia Spectrum: The very place their first fight took place!Every bit as good as the original 'Rocky' with the fight scenes where Rocky finally learned, with his trainer's Mickey's help, to fight defensively as well as slugging it out with Appollo Creed that are even better then in he first Rocky movie. The movie recreates the heart thumping and stirring scene of Rocky seriously training for the big fight ending with him sprinting to the finish line, after a five mile run, at the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art to the music of 'Gonna Fly Now'. But unlike in the first 'Rocky' movie this time he's not alone but with what looked like the entire city of Philadelphia tagging or running along with him!***SPOILERS****The highlight of the film the fight between Rocky and Appollo Creed even outdid the original with Rocky not a bit intimidated by Creed and after getting belted around taking the fight to him before the bell ending the first round, where Creed decked Rocky, sounded. Rocky also in being trained by Mickey to fight right handed, he was a natural southpaw, confused Creed long enough that he lost his cool a number of times in trying to figure out how to accurately fight him. Like in the first fight this one went, or almost went, the distance but in the end there was no doubt in who won it! It ended in a solid and undisputed knockout not like in the first fight that was in a split and unpopular decision.",8,6,7,25 April 2013
Forrest Gump," Gumped!
","***SPOILERS*** Incredibly schmaltzy movie about this borderline mentally retarded, with an IQ of 75, person who despite his disability gets himself involved in some of the most earth shaking events, in some cases even initiating them, of mid to late Twentieth Century America.It seems that fame glory and even fortune, which he's seems to be totally oblivious to, magically takes to Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks, like a bee or hungry bear takes to honey. Forrest despite having the mental capacity of an eight year-old ends up being a student, with a straight D average, at the highly touted Alabama State University and, after miraculously recovering from polio as a child, it's top 10 football team's star running back. Forrest is also the major reason that Alabama State was disaggregated despite the state's very pro segregation Governor, George Wallace, standing at the doors of the university not allowing black students to enter!Among the many achievements credited to Forrest is him, as a polio stricken youngster, teaching 'The King'-Elvis Presley-how to swings his hips and shake his behind, while preforming on stage, that made him the rock & roll legend, while still alive and after his death, that he was to become. The film gets more and more ridiculous as it goes along with Forrest not only becoming a national war hero-in him receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor as well as a VC bullet in his behind-in the Vietnam war but being involved in the biggest anti-war demonstration against that war, by just happening to be there, at the same time!Not only is Forrest a war hero he's also a vastly successful businessman, in him cornering shrimp market, a stock market whiz in him buying up hundreds if not thousands of shares in that up and coming 'Fruit Company'-Apple Electronics- for peanuts but is also the man-not Woodward & Burnstein- who broke the story of the Watergate break-in which had President Nixon resign from office in disgrace! While accomplishing all that Forrest in his spare time became the world champion Ping-Pong player defeating China's best at the Summer Olympics!Despite all his accomplishments Forrest feels that something is missing in his life in him being on the outs, she feels that he's somewhat of a weirdo, with his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, Robin Wright Penn. It's when Jenny gets pregnant with or without, it's never really fully explained in the movie, Forrest's child that she in her being an unwed mom, and addicted to crack cocaine, decides to finally give in and marry the big schlump. It's after that premature happy ending that Jenny is to find out that she's dying of an incurable disease, obviously AIDS, and leaves a totally confused and befuddled Forrest holding, together with little 'Forrest Gump Jr', the bag. In the end we see Forrest, like at the start of the movie, sitting on a bench waiting for the bus to take little Forrest to school as he munches on a box of chocolates reflecting on his incredible life that can happen not in real life but only in the movies!",6,1,3,4 September 2009
Fargo," Snowblind
","***SPOILERS*** The weird kidnap plan in the movie 'Fargo' was hatched at the 'King of Clubs' bar in Fargo ND. Ex-cons Carl Showalter & Gaear Grimsrud, Steve Buscemi & Peter Stormare, meet with Brainerd Minn., The home of Paul Bunyan & the Blue Ox, car executive Jerry Lundergaard, William H. Macy, in this half-baked plan to kidnap his wife Jean, Kristin Rudrud. All this in order to secure a $80,000.00 ransom from her dad Wade Gustafson, Harve Presnell, who's one of the richest men in Brainerd.Jerry and the two hoods were brought together by a mutual friend ex-con Shep Proudfoot, Steve Reevis, who not only spent time with both Carl & Gaear in the Stillwaters State Pen but also works as a car mechanic at the dealership that Jerry is working at and who his father-in-law Wade owns.Like the off-the-wall misfits that they are the plan goes to pot as soon as it's executed with a bungled kidnapping of Jean and later that evening the murder of a state trooper, James Saulke, and two windlessness who happened to come on the scene, J. Todd Anderson & Michelle Suzanne LeDoux, by the somewhat unstable Gear. Jerry needs the $40,000.00, his half in the deal, to replace money that he embezzled from the car dealership that he's working at. As the movie 'Fargo' go along it's marry way it, the money that Jerry embezzled, rises to almost $400,000.00. After the murdered bodies of the three victims of Gaear's rampage are discovered the police chief of Brainerd Marge Gunderson, Frances McDormand,is called into the case. Marge slowly gets all the evidence together and puts it in place thus cracking the murder/kidnap mystery wide open. Marge is a lot like TV's Let. Colombo, at first you don't for a moment realize that she's a policewomen much less the Chief of police in Brainerd County.Later her street, or lets say country, smarts and bulldog determination makes you as well as everyone else watching the movie believers long before the film 'Fargo' is over.Homely looking with an enormous appetite, due to her being pregnant, Marge slowly gets to the bottom of the murder mystery by zeroing in on Jerry who she felt was keeping some very important information for her. He doesn't realize that a car, a tan Ciera that was spotted at the murder scene,is missing from his car lot and that one of his workers Shep was in cohorts by phone with the two ex-cons! Shep received a phone call from the bar-motel where the two were staying at.Jerry tries to be cute even with his fellow partners in crime by upping the ransom to one million dollars without them knowing about it and insisting that he deliver the goods,the one million dollar ransom, by himself; so he can keep most of the money to cover his string embezzlement's at the car dealership. The entire scheme backfires when Wade insists that he handle the ransom pay-off, after all it's his money, that leads to him to getting shot and killed by an outraged Carl who was in turn is shot in the jaw by Wade before he died. At the hideout with Gaear and the kidnapped Jean, Carl also tried to cheat Gaear out of the Million by giving him only $40,000.00 of the ransom, It's hen when Carl finds thats Gaear murdered Jean and ends up getting split in half and murdered himself with an ax by his insane partner. Meanwhile Marge closes in on the gang and has Jerry on the run and out of the state, he's later arrested by the cops at a motel in Bismarck ND. Gaear is also captured by Marge as he tried to hide the evidence of his crimes, the bodies of Jean & Carl, by chopping them to pieces with a wood-chopping machine. Even though the movie 'Fargo' has it's share of thrills and excitement it also has it's touching moments too. One of the most moving scenes in the movie has to do with Marge meeting an old high school friend of hers at a local Minneapolis hotel restaurant Mike Yanagita, Steve Park. Mike goes into a whole song and dance about him working for the Honeywell Corp.as an engineer and how he lost his wife Linda, who Marge also knew from high school, to leukemia. Unable to talk anymore Mike begins to break down right in front of the startled policewomen sobbing uncontrollably. Later Marge found out that Mike was never married and doesn't work for the Honeywell Corp. and has been living with his parents since he left high school. If Mike was honest about his feelings to Marge, as well as any of his other friends, he would have easily gotten the sympathy that he wanted instead of being a phony to both Marge as well as to himself.",9,0,0,1 March 2005
The Hills Have Eyes," Eyes see You!
","***SPOILERS*** Incredibly grossed-out sequel to the 1977 original 'The Hills Have Eyes' follows the 1977 version almost scene for scene until some half hour into the movie. It's then, with the advancement of special effects over the last thirty years, the movie becomes an almost unwatchable horror show. Traveling to California Big Bob, Ted Levin, and his family stop off at this out of the way gas station, in the middle of the New Mexican desert. After filling up their given directions to a short cut through the hill by the somewhat creepy gas station attendant Tom Bower. It turns out that old Tom is working with a number of psychos who have it in for the human race because of the condition that they find themselves in; due the the years of nuclear testing in that part of the country.Disabling Big Bob's van, and the trailer attached to it, the unseen killers wait for darkness to fall and then make their move on the helpless, and unsuspecting, stranded travelers. With Big Bob going back to the gas station for help he's shocked to see old Tom laying drunk in the outhouse talking to himself. Before Big Bob can figure out what's wrong with Tom he takes out a shotgun and blows his brains out. Running to Old Toms car Big Bob is then attacked, by one of the many weirdos in the movie who ties him to a tree and sets it on fire.The next ten or so minutes in the movie with the out of hiding mutants attacking Big Bob's family are so disturbing and shocking, even to grown ups, that I'm surprised that the movie 'The Hills Have Eyes' didn't get an X-rating just for it's graphic violence alone. Breaking into the trailer the psychos fall upon Big Bob's younger daughter Brenda ,Emilie De Ravin, and manhandle, and possibly rape, her so badly that it's almost a miracle that she didn't end up losing her mind much less her life. Both Big Bob's wife Ethel and his older daughter Lynn, Kathleen Quinlan & Vinessa Shaw, are then viciously murdered. Lynn and her husbands Doug, Aaron Stanford, infant daughter Catherine is then kidnapped by the killers who take off into the hills.Big Bob's teenage son Bobby, Dan Byrd, had earlier gone out in the hills to find one of his pet German Shepherds Beauty and, after finding Beauty torn to pieces, fell off a cliff almost breaking his head. Helped by one of the psychos children Ruby(Laura Ortiz), who was about the most normal of the bunch, Bobby had some idea of what was in the hills but was just too traumatized and afraid to tell any of his family members. Now, with both his patents and sister-in-law murdered, Bobby becomes almost insane with anger only wanting to get even with those who did him family in.Lynn's husband Doug a life long pacifist and anti-gun activist also changes his opinion of guns and knives and every other weapon of death. Now becoming almost as ferocious and kill crazy as those who did Lynn in, and took his infant daughter Catherine away with them. This sets up the audience, who still have the nerve and stomach to stay around to watch the movie, for what has to be some of the most unwatchable and horrific scenes in motion picture history.Defintly not for the meek and weak at heart 'The Hills Have Eyes' is not the kind of movie that you'd take a girl, whom you want to impress, out to see. The violence in the film almost turns cartoon-like with both the killers and Doug and to a lesser extent Bobby and Brenda having it out in a battle of life and death in the empty desert as well as in a deserted town that was the test site and target of atomic explosions. Doug together with his pet dog Beast take on almost the entire band of mutant/psychos in his attempt to rescue his daughter. Dough ends up so badly beaten and mauled by these crazies that it's hard to believe that he's still alive by the time the movies over. Bobby and his sister Brenda have a somewhat easier time of it only having to deal with what seems like the head man or psycho of the bunch with him ending up blown straight to kingdom come, together with the family trailer, at the end of the movie.",6,0,0,27 June 2006
Rocky IV," Rocky IV; This time it's personal
","****SPOILERS**** Saved for the great fight scenes the movie Rocky IV is just a retread of the previous four Rocky films with Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone, bucking the odds and winning against monstrous odds against an opponent who in real life would have made quick work of him in the two ever battered it out for real. Dolph Londgren the king size Tab Hunter look alike playing Russian and gold medal Olympic super heavyweight boxing champion Ivan Drago in fact knocked the wind out of Stallone while filming a boxing scene in the movie that he ended up in the hospital, with a damaged heart and 200 over 140 blood pressure reading, in critical condition for over a week. Lundgren also mauled and manhandled actor Carl Weathers, who played former heavyweight champ Apollo Creed, so badly that he walked off the set until he was talked into coming back by Stallone among others to finish his part in the movie.This time around Rocky happily retired from boxing is forced to come back for just one more bout against the Siberian Express Ivan Drago after he knocked out cold and killed Apollo Creed in an exhibition match held at Las veges' MGM Grand Hotel Casino. With the 'Fight of the Century' scheduled to take place at Moscow's Olympic Arena on Christmas Day Rocky has to get himself into the best shape in his career to take on and beat the big bad an invincible Russian Bear. With the late Apollo's manager Duke Evers,Tony Burton, training him in the snowy wastelands of Siberia Rocky feels that he's now ready to do the impossible; Beat the Soviet giant and beat him on his home turf and at his own game.****SPOILERS**** In the early rounds of the bout it's Dargo's superior hight & strength as well as 90 inch reach that plummets and ties up, in the ropes & clinches, Rocky in his attempts to get inside him and punch away at his midsection. That in an effort to get Dargo to drop his guard and then have Rocky open up upstairs on his jaw in order to put the big guy away. With the rounds ticking away and despite the devastating punishment that he's taken Rocky is still on his feet by the time the last and 15th round comes around. with Rocky losing on points but still sanding on his feet it's the Russian crowd together with the Soviet Primier, played by a Mikhail Gorbachev look alike actor,that stands up and cheer on the American representative of the hated capitalist system Rocky Balboa against their home town hero and man of the people Ivan Dargo! That more then anything else energizes Rocky to keep up the good fight and with a dozen or so devastating body blows followed up by head shots puts the by now spent and exhausted Soviet Superman away with seconds to go in the 15th round.With no more worlds or opponents to conquer and having avenged Apollo's death in the ring at the hands of Ivan Dargo a battered and bloodied Rocky Balboa gives a speech to the filled to capacity audience in the boxing arena about how peace on earth and goodwill for all men is possible if only we can put our differences behind us just like he and Drago, who by now has the greatest respect for his once hated American opponent, did to the cheers of all the spectators including the Soviet Premier and the entire Politburo. What a way to end a movie!",6,0,0,7 July 2013
Collateral," Collateral Damage
","****SPOILERS***** Early in the film 'Collateral' Vincent, Tom Cruise, the hit-man with ice water in his veins for blood tells L.A cab driver Max, Jami Foxx,that in the city of L.A people are so detached and impersonal that he heard a story once about someone dying on a L.A transit train and nobody noticed he was dead until a day and a half later. Vincent didn't know it at the time about just how prophetic he was. Nail biting big city crime thriller about an out of town hit-man commandeering a cab as a getaway car with the reluctant driver going along for the ride. The hit-man makes his rounds in taking out a conglomerate of mob bosses crooked lawyers and government protected mob witnesses. As well as about a few dozen police mobsters and FBI agents in the process. Over-the-top and exciting but never boring movie has Vincent go through both the mobsters and law enforcement officers in L.A like a mad bull in a China shop seeing red with L.A cabbie Max unwillingly tagging along. Max picked up a pretty young federal attorney at the start of the movie Annie, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Annie was so impressed by Max's driving and knowledge of the city that she gave Max her card that had her business address and phone number. Unknown to both Max and Annie at the time it turned out to be a real lifesaver. Max later picking Vincent up at the L.A airport is given $600.00 by Vincent for him to drive him to five different stops as he does his rounds as a hit-man for the rest of the night. That $600.00 didn't make up for the damage that it cost Max who's cab was totaled and who's nerves were shot to pieces by the time the night was over. Vincent does his job with style and pizazz as well as bullets by blasting people out of windows and in high-rise law offices as well as during jazz sessions and in crowded nightclubs. Towards the end of the movie there was a incredible shoot-out at an L.A Chinese night spot, the Fever, that made the shoot-out at the OK Corral look like an episode of Sesame Street. 'Collateral' is the type of movie that you really can't take too seriously and have to suspend some belief watching it. The connection between Max and Vincent is a bit too contrived and very strained with Vincent putting up with all the nervous and unexpected acts that Max's does in the movie. these antics could have cost Vincent his freedom or even his life. Where at the same time we see Vincent blast away anyone in the film, who as much as looks at him a little funny, with out a show of emotion. But if Vincent did Max in right away the movie would have been over. At the same time if Max was too terrified to talk or even think and just went along with Vincent, even when he left him alone like Vincent did a few times in the movie, it would have taken away Max's personality which was what made the movie as effective as it was.'Collateral' is not a great film it has a lot of loose ends that are left untied by the time the movie is over but it keeps the pace and action moving. Especially with the sharp and funny inter-action between Max and Vincent in and out of Max's cab and on the streets freeways high rise buildings and subways of L.A. 'Collateral' is sure to become one of the summer of 2004 biggest hits.",8,0,1,7 August 2004
Cross of Iron," Men 'O War
","****SPOILERS**** It's spring 1943 in the Taman Peninsula with the once invincible German Army in full retreat. After the German Wehrmacht suffered a disastrous defeat at Stalingrad earlier in the year the Red Army then launched a massive 500 mile offensive along the souther sector of the Eastern Front. One of it's main objective is to recaptured the Crimea and Taman Peninsulas and it's there where the movie 'Cross of Iron' takes place.Sgt. Steiner, James Coburn, had been out on reconnaissance with his platoon and during a fire fight with the Soviet troops he captures a young Russian boy that later, instead of having him shot, not only spears his life but escorts the kid back to the Russian lines. Sgt. Seiner expecting that he'll be taken back by his comrades in the Red Army the boy soldier is instead machine gunned by the Reds before he could reached their trenches. This is how war is depicted in Sam Peckinpah's classic 'Cross of Iron' cold impersonal and deadly where in the end there's no winners but only losers on both sides of the battle-line.Undoubtaly the most shocking and effective anti, or even pro, war film ever made this side of 'All Quite on the Western Front' 'Cross of Iron' shows what war is really all about and how it effects by almost totally dehumanizing the men who participate in it. Taking over Steiner's company is an arrogant and pompous Prussian aristocratic jerk Capt.Humptmann Stransky, Maximilian Schell. Capt. Stransky wanted a transfer from his cushy assignment in occupied France to the bloody and hell-fire Eastern Front so he can earn himself the coveted Iron Cross. We see right away that Stransky and Steiner don't at all care for each other since in Stiner's case he already has earned an Iron Cross and is anything but overjoyed by it. Referring to the Iron Cross Sgt. Steiner says that it's just a worthless piece of medal but Capt. Stransky is so obsessed by the German war decoration that he goes so far as to blackmail one of his men Let. Triebig, Roger Fritz, to falsify a sworn statement, which Sgt. Steiner refuses to do, to testify to his courage in battle. During one of the many battles that Steiner & Stransky participated in a Let. Meier, Igor Galo, lead a counter-attack against the attacking Reds, which cost Meier's life, repulsing and thus keeping the Russians from overrunning his infantry company's defensive positions. Stransky was hiding in his bunker during the entire Russian assault. After the dust cleared Stransky tried to get the credit that the dead Let. Meier earned by telling his superior Col. Brandt, James Mason, that it was he, Captain Stransky, who manned the guns and passed out the ammunition during he fighting not Meier. It's later when Steiner is wounded in action and hospitalized, for a severe concussion, that Capt. Stansky's orders from Col. Brandt to receive an Iron Cross is just about finalized. Yet the very fact that Steiner is still alive and not willing to go along with the ridicules sham of Strasky being a war hero, which he's not, that leads that low-life Prussian swine to do everything in his power to not only get Steiner but his entire platoon killed in a sick act of revenge and cover-up.Great study of how war brings the worst, as well as best, out in people. With a heroic but disenchanted Sgt. Steiner not only fighting the enemy Red Army but his own superiors. With the only thing he cares about, and is willing to give his life up for, is the men in his platoon. In the end even Sgt. Steiner's platoon, by then reduced to only two men, has no attachment to him anymore. Steiner leaves it and goes after the hated Stransky who was responsible for having it mowed down. When the platoon,together with Sgt.Steiner,tried to make it's way back to the main German lines. Caught in no-mans land in a vicious cross-fire between the Red Army and fellow German troops ,under the command of Stransky's boot-licking lackey Let. Triebig, Steiner's platoon was wiped out almost to the last man. Triebig's own men couldn't continue, when they realized that they were shooting on their fellow German soldiers, to keep firing on Steiner's platoon with a totally outraged Steiner jumping into the trenches where Let. Triebig was trying to make a run for it. Cornering the rat after the gutless coward pleaded for his life telling Steiner that he was only following, Capt Stransky's, order. Sgt. Steiner then blasted Triebig to bits and pieces reloading his machine gun at least once as he kept pumping away. It's now left for Sgt. Steiner to come face to face with Capt. Stransky and make him answer for what he did to him and his men in his selfish quest for the Iron Cross. A medal that he planned to get at the expense of the lives of men who were far more qualified to get it then he'll ever be.A once in a lifetime movie about war and the courage cowardice and self-sacrifice that comes along with it. An outstanding cast headed by James Coburn and Maximilian Schell leaves it's audience with a real insight of what war is really all about. As well as a unique experience of how men, and women, are changed forever by both living and suffering through it.",10,2,4,24 August 2006
The Machinist," A dark secret exposed to the light of truth
","**SPOILER ALERT** Dark and depressing movie about a guilty past thats above and beyond everything thats done by the person responsible for it; who' been trying to suppress it for over a year. Not being able to sleep or eat properly Trevor Reznik, Christian Bale,has dropped to under 120 lbs. from his normal 180 lbs. six foot two inch,frame looking like he's a concentration camp survivor. Working at the machine plant one day Trevor is spotted by Ivan, John Sharian, who seems to know a lot about him and tells Trevor that he works with him at the plant. Never seeing Ivan in his life, much less at work, this plays on Trevor's mind to the point where he asks his fellow workers who this Ivan is. Trevor is told that one one ever saw him on the work-floor or even knew him. One day at work helping fellow worker Miller, Michael Ironsides, with the machinery Trevor sees Ivan who for some reason gave him the slit throat sign.Trevor is so startled by seeing him he backs up hitting the activator button on the machine that Miller was working on causing him to lose his left arm.Even though Trevor is exonerated for the accident that cost Miller his arm, and even Miller forgave him for what happened, no one at the factory wants to work with Trevor. Trevor still holds,not just himself responsible for Millers loss, that Ivan had something to do with the accident and wants to find Ivan who he feels is somehow trying to do him in, but why? This Ivan is a very odd duck looking like Marlon Brando's portrayal of Col. Walter E. Kurtz in the movie 'Apocalypes Now' with two of his toes grafted on his left hand to replace two missing fingers,looking like claws. He not only keeps popping up in Trevors life but has a connection with a number of people that Travor knows like Reynolds, who Ivan said that he replaced in 'The Pit', in the plant. Ivan also knows Stevie,Jennifer Jason Leigh, a hooker who Travor's frequents. Trevor found that out through a photo that he took from Ivan's wallet as if Ivan left it at the bar on purpose for Travor's to steal it from him that he found in Stevies apartment. Ivan's wallet also contains a photo of Reynolds, who claimed that he never knew Ivan, on it together with Ivan showing off a catch that they had while out fishing! The story gets even weirder when Trevor's girlfriend Marie,Aitana Sanchez-Gijon, a waitress at the airport diner turns out to be a figment of his imagination. Trevor finds that out when he's told by the waitress at the diner that she, like Ivan at the machine plant, never worked there. Trevor knowing Ivan's car license goes so far as to get himself hit by a speeding car so he could report the license plate to the police in a hit and run report. All this to find out if this Ivan, who's license plate number he gave, is for real only to find out, to his surprise, that the plate number of the car was that of his car that he reported stolen by him last year! Slowly losing his mind Trevor again sees Ivan's car in the streets one night and follows it to his apartment seeing that he had Marie's young son Nicholas, Matthew Romero-Moore, with him. Following Ivan & Nicholas into the apartment Trevor is told by Ivan that he just murdered the young boy leading Trevor to get into a fight with him slitting his throat; like the death sigh that Ivan gave him at the factory earlier in the film, killing him. Wraping up Ivan's body in a rug and taking it out at night to dispose it into the ocean Trevor finds out to his surprise that there's no body in the rug and that there never was any Ivan, he only existed in poor Trevor's sick and disturbed mind! It's then when everything that was safely hidden in the dark reaches of Trevor's mind started to reveal itself to him as he realized what he did and that he had to pay for his crime. It's then that Trevor finally made peace with himself as he gave himself up to the police to face the bar of justice.Very weird movie who's confusing story is more then made up by it's powerful surprise ending that ties all the loose ends together for those of us who were still around watching it.",7,1,3,12 February 2005
The Exorcist," THEE Classic Modern Horror Movie
","'The Exorcist' is a film that goes full-circle from modern Twentieth Century medicine to the church exorcism of the middle ages, all within the two hours that it's on the screen. The movie revolves around three characters in it: Father Merrin, Max Von Sydow, Father Karras, Jason Miller, and Regan MacNeil, Linda Blair. Father Merrin unsuspectingly releases the devil from an ancient archaeological dig that he's in charge of in northern Iraq which ends up possessing little Regan MacNeil in Georgetown USA. Father Karras is the priest who suggested that an exorcism was warranted after examining Regan, with Karras being a trained psychiatrist, and seeing that she's beyond all known psychiatric and medical help. Father Merrin seems guilt-stricken in the beginning of the movie when he realized that he released a demonic spirit into the world by unearthing it from the ruins of his expedition. When he's contacted by the church later in the movie to preform an exorcism Father Marrin sees his chance to correct what he unwitting did by driving the evil spirit out of little Regan's body that he feels that he was responsible for.Father Karras, who is losing his faith in his religion, who's also guilt-ridden over his mothers death sees in saving Regan from her demonic possession, which he became convinced of after examining her, as a restoration of his faith. Karras also feels that the exorcism will make up for him not being more attentive to his mother who died and wasn't found in her NYC apartment until days later. Regan MacNeil, who by being the innocent victim of demonic possession, brought both priests together in a common case to exorcise the devil out of her body and in that way redeem themselves of their guilty consciences. The final half hour of the film 'The Exorcist' is one of the most memorable as well as heart stopping chapters in movie history. Both Fathers Merrin and Karras heroically succeed is casting the devil out of Regan but at a frightful price to themselves.'The Exorcist' is truly one of the greatest horror movies of all time even with some awful drawbacks. The dubbing of Regan's voice as that of the devil comes across like the very bad dubbing of English dialog in a Japanese monster movie. Regan's head-turning scenes in the movie are more comical then scary. The ending of the movie leaves you up in the air to who won the battle, in Regans bedroom, between good and evil?the priest or the devil?. Still if imitation is a form of success then 'The Exorcist' which had hundreds of imitators over the last thirty years is undeniably one of the great, as well as influential, films of all times.",9,2,3,2 November 2003
The Usual Suspects," Making a simple plan complicated doesn't make one brilliant
","******SPOILERS****** Highly overdone movie about a mass killing in a shoot-out and explosion of a ship docked at San Pedro Harbor with connections to a notorious Hungarian drug gang. As well as a crew of hoods recruited out of NYC who tried to rip the gang off of the 91 million dollars of coke on the ship. Added to that a mysterious mob kingpin who set up the whole operation, for very personal reasons, to use as cover for him to knock off a witness on the ship that was to be turned over by the gang to the FBI as a witness against him that could land the mob kingpin behind bars for life. All this is seen in flashback, at the San Pedro Police Station, with Special US Customs Agent Dave Kujan, Chazz Palmintri, interviewing Roger Verbal (Kevin Spacey),the only survivor of this holocaust, for what seems like the time you would have sat through an old movie triple-feature with cartoons newsreels and coming attractions added on. We're bombarded by Verbal's story that goes on endlessly about how he and his fellow hoods were recruited by Mr. Kobayashi, Pete Postiethwaite, back in New York City some six weeks earlier to do a job for the mysterious Kayser Soze (?) ,whom they are told by Kobayashi that they are in debt to. Verbal goes on endlessly talking about this very strange and confusing plan that the Kayser concocted which in the end turns out to be an elaborate hit, by himself, of a protected government witness. You would think if this Kayser Soze was as smart as the movie makes him out to be why didn't he or his mouthpiece, Kabayashi, tell these hoods just to knock off the witness instead of having all this killing going on at the San Pedro Harbor as well as all over the country with all of them ending up dead except Verbal? And even more important why did he, The Kayser, have to kill the witness himself leaving himself open to being killed or captured by the Hungarian drug gang as well as the recruited hoods themselves if they ever found out who he was, and what he was planing for them, or the police? Another thing that doesn't make sense about the movie 'The Usual Suspects' is that this Kayser Soze who is so unknown and secretive even to his fellow mobsters, it seemed that only Mr. Kobayashi knew just who he was, would be that well known by the FBI or local police to be identified and arrested? And who would their protected witness know who to finger if this Kayser Soze was so unidentifiable? What was so important about this person that the Kayser was dealing with, and wanted to knock off, that he would reveal his real identity and place of residents to him where he would blow the cover that he so painstakingly built up over the years? Was this individual involved in preparing the Kysers Federal and State Income Tax returns? Even at the end of the film when it was finally revealed just who the Kyser was you still didn't really know who he was since he was using an allies just like the name Kayser Soze itself obviously was. And even if the FBI and local police really knew who he was and where he was and went to arrest him would the murderous and cunning Kayser Soze just stay there and let himself be taken into custody? With all the avenues of escape and control with his mob's vast resources available to him? The ending of the movie shocked you only because it seemed to make sense at the time that you were exposed to it but after getting over the shock and realizing just how irrational it was, as well as the whole film, you began to see that's all it really was: An end to the movie.",7,8,16,7 April 2004
The Butterfly Effect," The Scream of the Butterfly
","****SPOILERS**** The movie 'Butterfly Effect' starts off like a deep psychological drama and then slowly turns into and finally in the last half of the film becomes a Sci-Fi adventure about time travel. Young Evan Treborn, Ashton Kutcher, has been suffering severe black-outs all his life, a condition that put his father Jason, Callum Keith, in a mental institution. Being examined at the hospital for his black-outs the doctor suggests that Evan keep a journal, which is central to the story, about what happened every day to him in order to jog back his memory. As Edan grows up and leaves for college the black-outs stop and for once in his life Edan becomes normal like everyone else. Involved in a college project about memory retention Evan dusts off his journals that he hasn't read for years and when he does read them the black-outs of his childhood begin to be filled in. Excited over this discovery Edan goes to see a childhood friend Larry,Elden Henson, who he hasn't seen for years to confirm if his new memories of the past are true or just imagined. To Edan's surprise from what he gets from Larry his visions are true but Larry unlike Edan wants to forgets about them. Edan's bringing them up depresses Larry so much that his mother tells Edan never to see or call Larry again. Edan then goes back to the town where he lived as a little boy to see Kayley, Amy Smart,who is at first glad to see him but when Edan brings up the story about her and himself being forced to have sex and being taped by her sick and pedophile father George,Eric Stoltz, she becomes very upset. It may be new to Evan but Kayley had been trying to put that terrible event out of her mind for years and didn't want it brought up again. Still Edan is so obsessed about what Kayley's father did to her and himself that he doesn't notice or realize how it's hurting Kayley and later he finds out from her outraged brother Tommy, Willie Lee Scott, that Kayley killed herself. After that movie turns from a drama about remembering past events to going back in time to change them. It's never fully explained, all Edan does is just look dates in his journal, just how but Edan somehow manages to go back in time and try to change events, that happened to him and his friends, for the better but instead they only become worse. Edan goes back in time four times and in all those times that he changes the past the future is even bleaker that it was without the changes. Edan ends up killing Tommy and then put in jail where he's beaten and brutalized. He's responsible for having Larry kill Tommy which has Larry put away in a mental ward for the rest of his life and Keyley becomes a hooker and drug addict from the shock of seeing her brother Tommy killed as a young girl. Edan loses both his arms in an explosion that leads his mother Andrea, Melona Waiters, who never touched tobacco, starts to chain-smoke and eventually dies of lung cancer at an early age. And on his last trip back in time Edan accidentally kills Kayley, by trying to stop her father from molesting her, when he's seven years-old and spends the rest of his life in a mental hospital.Even though Edan's father has the same illness as Edan has we never see him go back in time. The end of the movie is a bit of a letdown with Edan putting Kayley out of his life forever when they both were seven years-old and thus not try to go back in time to correct the damage that her father, as well as himself by bringing it up, did to Kayley that led to her suicide. As far as we know time travel may very well be possible in the future but the ability to change past events isn't. Changing the past for the better,if at all possible, is like a game of poker, you never know what hand you'll be dealt. If your able to change past events you can't know how those changes will effect the future and those effect can make the future far worse then it already is. Which is what Edan so sadly found out in the movie 'The Butterfly Effect'.",7,1,4,11 August 2004
City of God," Life & Death on the mean streets in 'The City of God'
","****SPOILERS**** The movie 'The City of God' starts where it ends with a bloody showdown between the Li'lZe mob and their very young allies 'The Young Runts' having it out with the Carrot and Ned Knockout gang. Sandwiched between those two scenes are a number of brutal killings that dull your senses and condition you for the movies ferocious and climactic bloodbath. Savage and surrealistic movie about life and death in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and how great the odds are for anybody surviving in that 'Hell on Earth'. The movie starts out with eight young men growing up in 'The City of God' with only one of them remaining alive by the time the movie is over. Rocket is by far the most sympathetic of those in the movie as he tries all throughout the film, and in the end succeeds, in overcoming the odds against him to become a productive and law-abiding citizen but also a top Brazilian newspaper photographer. I felt that it was Ned Knockout who was the best example of how those mean and deadly 'City of God' streets drive both young and old alike into a life of crime and violence even, unlike Rcket, if they do their best to avoid it. Ned a quiet and peaceful young man was publicly humiliated by the brutal and vicious thug in the movie Li'lZe. Not having tortured Ned enough Li'lZe and his gang came to Ned's home where they murdered his brother Gelson when he tried to defend and protect Ned. This tragedy was compounded when Ned in a rage killed a number of the Li'lze mob and then joined up with the Carrot gang to battle the Li'lZe mob and their Young Runt allies. During a bank robbery by the Carrot mob Ned shot and killed a bank guard who's son Max later joined the Carrot mob to avenge his fathers death. In the final street battle in the movie Ned is shot and killed by the son of the man that he murdered Max as he was trying to save his, Max's, life. All this after Ned was shot and badly wounded by the Li'lZe mob .Both Ned and Max were at first innocent bystanders who turned to crime because of circumstances beyond their control and ended up both killing and getting killed in the whirlpool of violence that engulfed the 'City of God'. The movie plays like one of those 1930's and 40's Warner Brothers crime movies where neighborhood crime becomes a part of the lives of those who live there and the theater audience can only accept the violence on the screen since there's no way for those in the movie to get out of that brutal environment. The acting in the film by mostly a cast of unknowns is surprisingly good with a very skillful directing effort by L. Mireiles. Mireiles keeps the story flowing smoothly and keeps the violence in check and at the same time makes it very effective and realistic. The ending of the movie with Li'lZe getting blasted to pieces by a group of the members of 'The Young Runts' his allies who turned on him, many of them then under 12 year old, showed how the cycle of death and violence continues. A none ending cycle of death and destruction that effects those living on the mean streets and knowing nothing else. Even at a very young and impressionable age in the pitiless and merciless horror called 'The City of God'.",9,3,6,21 June 2004
JFK," Fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side Bubba!
","Director Oliver Stone gives the JFK assassination the royal treatment, over three hours worth of running time,in his blockbuster 1991 shocker of a movie 'JFK' in it getting to the bottom to who in fact not only shot the president but who was both behind and planned the assassination and cover up that followed it. It was of all things the Clay Shaw, Tommy Lee Jones, trial that Stone used in his movie 'JFK' to totally disprove the by now in the garbage can, in that almost no one believes it anymore, Warren Commission Report on the assassination. In that the Clay Shaw trial was the first and only trial that involved the JFK assassination with Shaw, a successful New Orleanes businessman,being charged with being, a planner not shooter, behind it.The movie succeeds in disproving the Warren Commission but falls somewhat flat on its face in trying to connect a number of US Government agencies, like the CIA, the Mafia anti-Castro Cubans as well as Vice President Johnson as being somehow behind JFK's assassination. It was like Stone trowing a plate of spaghetti on the wall and see what would stick. Still Stone does a masterful job in waking the public up to the discrepancies as well as out right lies that they've been fed over the years by major members of the US media that Lee Harvey Oswald, Gary Oldman, was the lone nut assassin or the assassin at all. It's three years after JFK was killed that New Orleans D.A Jim Garrison, Kevin Costner, decided to reopen the case in that Oswald originally was in the city, as a Marxist Communist activist, the summer before JFK was murdered. Oswald was also closely associated with a number of people who wanted President Kennedy dead and made no bone in hiding their dislike of him.As Garrison uncovers evidence that shows Oswlald was not what the media as well as the FBI and Warren Commission made him out to be key witnesses to what happened that fateful afternoon in Dallas Texas, November 22 1963, start to either clam up disappeared or meet an unexpected end in life. One of them is the wacko David Ferrie, Joe Pesci, who was in the same US civil air patrol unit with Oswald back in the mid 1950's when Oswald was still in his teens. Ferrie made an unexpected trip to Dallas to go duck hunting with a number of his friends the day that JFK was shot and left the very same evening! Was it to shoot JFK not ducks that Ferrie & Co were really interested in? It was through Ferrie as well as convicted male hooker Willie O'Keefe, Kevin Bacon, that eventually lead to Shaw in his being suspected of having foreknowledge to the JFK assassination. In that all three, Ferrie O'Keefe & Shaw, had a mutual acquaintance with non other then Lee Harvey Oswald! JFK's convicted in absentia assassin, since he was deceased and couldn't defend himself, by the Warren Commission!As interesting as the movie is it's the last 15 or 20 minutes that really hit home and make an impression on the audience when D.A Jim Garrison makes his final summation to the jury. It's then that all the BS half truths lies shyster talk and inconsistencies in what happened on November 22, 1963 becomes apparent to those of us watching the film as well as those in the courtroom. Even though Garrison doesn't end up convicting Clay Shaw in his part in the JFK assassination he does in fact prove that we've, the American public, had been had or conned into believing what the US Government and Warren Commission told us the truth about the 'facts' in the JFK assassination without as much as bothering to check any of the facts or evidence out! Which in fact D.A Jim Garrison not only did but in his Don Quixote like determination attempted to, against overwhelming odds,and proved to the jury! Who despite finding Shaw innocent agreed that a conspiracy was involved in the assassination of JFK. P.S It was ironic as well as a stroke of genius for Stone to cast the real Jim Garrison in the film as non other as Chief Justice Earl Warren who comes across as if he's either brain dead or suffering from the advance stages of Alzhimer Disease in his robotic and zombie like performance. It was Warren and his Warren Commission that Jim Garrison was out to prove was either totally inept or criminally irresponsible in covering up the true facts behind the JFK assassination!",8,2,10,3 May 2012

Pi," The Perfect Number
","********SPOILERS******* Max Cohen, Sean Gullette, is obsessed with numbers. A mathematical genius who earned a PHD at the age of 16 has a theory about the universe and wants to prove it to his own satisfaction. 1. Math is the language of the universe. 2. Everything around us can be understood by numbers. 3. If you graph a number of any system patterns emerge, therefor patterns are everything in nature.We're told by Max at the beginning of the movie that when he was a little boy his mother warned him not to stare into the sun because it would hurt his eyes, but Max did. He stared so long into the sun that he temporarily went blind. This may be the reason in the movie 'Pi' why Max keeps getting terrible headaches and why he's constantly taking medication to relive them. In his apartment in New York's Chinatown Max built Euclid a powerful computer that he feels can prove his theory. Using the stock market as a model Max tries to prove that even that can be deciphered by his calculations and feeds stock quotes into Euclid to prove his point by predicting their rising and falling in the future. Patterns are everywhere in nature, Max says, even in the stock market. One afternoon when Max puts Euclid to it's final test to see if his theory is correct the computer crashes. Before it did it printed out a long string of numbers that seemed to make no sense at all to Max who threw it in the garbage. Hurt that all that he did to prove his theory went up in smoke, Max goes to see his former mathematics and psychics professor Sol Robeson, Mark Margolis, to get some support and sympathy. When Sol hears that Euclid printed a list of numbers before it crashed he gets very excited and asks Max how many numbers, 100, 1,000 216 how many? Max told Sol that it was all meaningless to him and that he threw it away. Later sitting in a diner Max runs into Lenny Meyer, Ben Shenkman, an Hasidic Jew who's also interested in numbers in the interpretation of the Kabbala. Lenny then tries to get Max interested in the mysteries of the Kabbala. Max doesn't realize at the time but later in the movie when he's saved from a gang of Wall Street goons by Lenny and his Hasidic friends that the number of God in the Talmud is exactly 216 digits! The number that he so foolishly discarded after Euclid crashed! The same number of digits that Sol gave him about how many numbers did his computer print out before it blew. Max, before he found out just what that number meant, starts to realize that there was something in what Euclid's last communication was but that he stupidly threw it away. Going back to the garbage where he threw the paper with the numbers away Max finds that it's long gone.Earlier in the movie 'Pi' we were introduced to an executive of a Wall Street firm Marcy Dawson, Pamela Hart, who was constantly pestering Max to lend his knowledge and services to her firm. Always ignoring and trying to avoid her things changed but after the crash of Max's computer Euclid. It's when Marcy offers Max something called a Ming Mecca chip, which is classified by the US government, Max suddenly becomes interested. Max needs that chip to restart his computer and find out what that important number that he so foolishly threw away was. With everything set Max starts up Euclid and after some hesitation the elusive 216 digit number comes up on the screen but for some reason doesn't get printed so Max writes it down on a piece of paper and programs it back into the computer. With Euclid giving out information Max then sees that he can predict stock prices ahead of time. It's now that Max realizes that Sol has been keeping this information about a 216 digit number that can interpret all the patterns of the universe from him all these years. Going to Sol's apartment to confront him about what he found out and why Sol tried to keep him from finding it out, Max is told by a nurse who answered the door that Sol passed away the day before. In Sol's apartment Max sees papers on which Sol wrote about what the same elusive number, God's number, was and what it meant and it seemed that the stress of all that work on Sol's part cause his death. Max finally realized, what Sol did years ago, that there is some knowledge that is better kept to itself for it's too dangerous for anyone to pursue. Very weird and at the same time interesting film by Darren Aronofsky about math and what math has to do with the working with the universe and how someone can become so obsessed with it that it can destroy him and everyone else that he comes in contact with.",8,11,16,4 October 2003
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," We can't defend freedom abroad when we deny it to ourselves here at home!
","Documentary-style account of the Edward R. Morrow Joseph P. McCarthy battle over the airwaves. The historical battle was over the right to be confronted by one's accuser on the issue of being a Communist or former member of a Communist, or Communist front, organization.It's October 1953 and the big news is about a US Air Force officer Let. Milo Radulovich being drummed out of the USAF because of Let. Radulovich's association with his own father John, a suspected Communist sympathizer. This story was something that was a little bit over the top in the opinion of CBS News commentator Edward R. Morrow, David Strathairn, who decided to run with the story on his weekly new program 'See it Now'.It eventually turned out that John Radulovich's only sympathy with the Communist regime in his native Yougaslavia was his scribing to a newspaper, who yearly colorful calender he liked. The fact that he didn't speak or read English only Serbian, which the newspaper was printed in, was the only reason that Mr. Radulovich had anything to to with it in the first place!Realizing that people like Wisconsin's junior Senator Joe McCarthy, convincingly and brilliantly played by himself,are a bigger danger to America's freedom and democracy then any outside Communist threat Morrow took on the case of Let. Radulovich who was being pressured by not only the USAF but Sen. McCarthy as well. The case was later dropped by the US military since it was so ridicules and un-American that it would have in fact helped the cause of Communism more then hurt it.Edward R. Morrow now turns his guns on Sen. McCarthy himself but this could very well backfire on him since McCarthy at the time was a very popular Communist fighter in the Senate. An attack on him would end up not only having Morrow smeared as a Communist, or Communist stooge, but cause his news network CBS to go bankrupt with all it's sponsors deserting it and having himself and his fellow newsmen on CBS out of a job and a career.The movie centers on two Edward R. Morrow 'See it Now' shows, March 9, & April 6, 1954, that in the end began the study downfall of the powerful Joseph R. McCarthy. For all intents and purposes Joseph McCarty's political career ended with him being censored by the Senate, on December 2, 1954, for his unprofessional-like and rude behavior. There was also of course the disastrous, for Joe McCarthy, Army-McCarthy Hearings in the spring of 1954 that the movie 'Good Night and Good Luck' almost completely ignored or overlooked? Properly because Edward R. Morrow and the staff of CBS' 'See it Now' had nothing to do with them.The battle with Joe McCarthy did in the end take a lot out of Edward R.Morrow and his colleagues. His best friend and fellow news commentator Don Hollenbeck, Ray Wise, ended up killing himself because of his wife leaving him and the brutal criticism from the press that he got for supporting Edward R. Morrow. The movie starts and end at a banquet for Morrow on October 25, 1958, a year after Senator Joe McCarthy's death, which he tells his audience that we can only lose our freedoms from the inside by not standing up to those in political power who want to take them away from us, under the guise of patriotism and national security. Hopefully what we learned in the early 1950's, at the hight of the Cold War, will not be forgotten by future generations of politically educated, in the words of US Constitution and Bill of Rights, and freedom loving Americans; we can only hope and pray that Edward R. Morrow was right.",8,2,4,19 March 2006
The Evil Dead," The House where Evil Dwells
","**SPOILERS** Shocking and terrifying horror movie that uses it meager $350,000.00 budget to the fullest extent to scare the living hell out of it's audience. Far better then the many multi-million dollar slasher/splatter films that it's, or their, constantly compared to.Five college students take a ride out in the heavily wooded wilds of Tennessee to spend the weekend at a cabin that they rented and things start to go bad even before they reach their destination. Crossing a creaky bridge the car almost falls through the rotted woodwork and barley makes it to the other side. At the cabin the students brother and sister Ashley or 'Ash' and Linda Williams, Bruce Campball & Besty Baker, together with friends Scotty Cheryl & Shelly, Richard DeManincor Ellen Sandweiss Theresa Tilly,find the place a mess. Cleaning up the place they unearth a book and tape recordings, together with a reel to reel tape recorder, that belonged to the cabin's previous owner.All this time we get to see and feel that there's something evil in and around the cabin that's just waiting to get unleashed. It's the strange book and weird sounding tape recordings that the new occupants found there that serves as the trigger or linchpin that set. the evil spirit, it into motion. Reading from the book that seems to be a hand-written copy of the notorious Satanic Book of the Dead, Necocomicon, the students then play back the tapes, that they found along with it. The tapes has the owner of the cabin explain what happened to him when he deciphered the books mysteries that must have drove him either out of his mind or in his grave or both. The former cabin owner gives out, on the tape, this eerie and blood-curdling Cathulhu chant that activates the evil that surrounds the cabin. That brings the forces of hell out of their long sleep and into the open taking over the bodies and minds of the unsuspecting students. One at a time it turns them on each other until the cabin, and the area immediately outside of it, turns into a mind-numbing and horrific slaughter-house.Not for those that are weak of heart 'The Evil Dead' has an unrelenting drive to it that's never-ending. Not giving you a chance to catch your breath even once the unearthly and evil action once it's starts going and never ever stops. Even the ending, when the horrible night in the cabin is finally over, it sets you and the lone survivor of this massacre up for a nasty surprise with a jump-out-of-your-seat final.Even though some of the scenes with the Evil Force taking over the students bodies may be a bit overdone, especially in the make-up department, they still jolt you right out of your skin. You start to get the feeling, like those in the movie, that there's nothing on earth that can stop the Forces of Evil unknowingly released by the students. That's until those who released them are overcome possessed and finally consumed by them.",8,3,5,8 August 2006

Mission: Impossible," The Noc List
","***SPOILERS*** Action packed movie version of the popular 1960's and 70's TV series that has almost the entire 'Mission Impossible' team including its top man Jim Phelps, Jon Voight, wiped out within the first twenty minutes of the film.Surviving the carnage Agent Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise, is suspected by his boss Eugene Kittridge, Henry Czerny, in the CIA to be the mole that they suspected infiltrated the Mission Impossible team. It's Kittridge suspicions that Hunt is working for the mysterious arms dealer Mr. Max, who's actually a Mrs, in trying to obtain the NOC List, a list of every CIA Agent in Eastern and Western Europe, for him at the price of a cool 10 million in non negotiable US Government Bonds. We of course know, since he's the star of the film, that Hunt is innocent of all charges but it's up to him to prove it before he ends up getting whacked a a team of CIA assassins!As things turn out Hunt soon realizes that he's in fact being used as bait to bring the real mole out into the open by the clever and anything goes, in finding him, Kittridge. The real NOC List is actually stored in the CIA headquarters computer data base in Langly Virginia. It's Hunt's plan to seal the list and use it as leverage against Kittridge to not only get his dogs, CIA hit-teams, off his back but have both his mom and uncle, (Laura Brock & Morgan Deare), who were framed by Kittridge as being international drug dealers, out of police custody back in the states!***SPOILER ALERT*** Hard to follow at first with the many side plots in it the movie really takes off when Hunt starts to put all the loose ends together and realizes who this mole, code name Job, really is. Playing along with the traitor, to the US as well as Hunt and his fellow agents, Hunt soon finds out that the remaining member of his Mission Impossibe team, who was thought to have be killed in a car explosion, is the mole's back up man or woman in throwing him as well as Kittridge off his trail!

Where Eagles Dare," Mutt & Jeff goes to war
","***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Heart-pounding war action adventure with an assault on an impregnable mountain fortress by a squad of hand picked top British commandos, with a US Army Ranger thrown in for good measures. The assault is a rescue attempt of a captured US Army general who's one of the top men in Gen. Eisenhowers high command in the planning of opening up a second front in Western Europe. It turns out that the rescue team is actually infiltrated by a number of German Agents who are on to what the British/USA rescue team are up to. The German Agents turn out to be so stupid or incompetent that they help, more then hurt, the rescue operation from being exposed and taken out by an elite division, the Alpine, of hardened German SS troopers who happen to be the best mountain fighters in the world.Lead by British Major Jon Smith, Richard Burton, the commandos penetrate the impregnable Nazi fortress the Scholoss Alder, high up in the Bavarian Alps, as easily as you would go down and penetrate your local bar, by just walking through the front door, to buy yourself a drink even with more then half of the British commandos being Nazi Agents! The non -stop action has both Smith and his US Ranger compatriot Let. Morris Schaffer played by a very confused and bewildered looking Clint Eastwood take on and wipe out almost the entire Nazi Alpine Division, as well as a squadron of the Luftawaffe. They do all this without as much as even having to get re-supplied with ammunition and explosives, which they seem to have an unlimited supply of, by an RAF/USAAF air drop.Joined by pretty British Agent Mary Elison, Mary Ure, Smith and Schaffer make a shamble of the German Army who are even more buffoonish then they were portrayed to be in the darkest days of WWII in movies released by Hollywood in order to drum up moral at home and in the war zone. If the rescue of Gen. Carnaby wasn't hard enough it turns out that Smith is involved in a number of dealings with the Nazi's where he's as much as a a triple or even quadruple agent for both the British and German governments. All that leaves his comrade Let. Schaffer in such a state of confusion that he at one point out of sheer frustration almost killed him in order to make sure that Smith won't, which he did in the movie a number of times, double-cross him.The hot and heavy action has the Germans use up thousands upon thousands of rounds of ammunition, small arms and artillery, on the three allied commandos, Smith Schaffer & Elison, and only scoring with a minor flesh wound on one of them, Smith's hand, for all their efforts. The way that the commandos dispatch the hapless and ineffective German troops actually makes the audience feel some sympathy for them in that their so outmatched that to cheer for the good guy UK/USA commandos over the bad guy Nazi German troops would be like cheering for a pit-bull to beat chihuahua in a dog fight.Taking out more Germans, or Japaneses, then John Wayne could have ever dreamed of doing in all of his WWII action movies combined the trio then make a run for it to the nearest German Luftawffe airfield. Then again as easy as shooting fish in a barrel the dynamic and indestructible trio, Dick Clint & Mary, take out the helpless German troops without as much as breaking out into a sweat as they blow up a string of Nazi fighter planes and are then rescued by the British who land and take off almost unopposed and ferry them out. It's then that we find out, with the exception of Maj Smith who was on to him from day one, ***SPOILER*** that the entire operation was sabotaged by one of the top British MI6 intelligence officers who planned it!You have to suspend belief and logic to enjoy 'Where Eagels Dare' which doesn't at all, how could it!, seem to take itself really seriously in it's treatment of the evil Nazis. The movie has the Nazis look more like a German version of the Three, or in this case three thousand, Stooges then the ruthless and effective sh*t-kickers that they really were.",7,0,3,2 March 2007
From Hell," Ripping his way into the pages of history
","(There are Spoilers)The film 'From Hell' is not as far out as you may have at first thought in who the infamous 'Jack the Ripper' really was. As Scotland Yard Inspector Fredrick Abberline, Johnny Depp, at first suspected the 'Ripper' was not just your garden verity psycho killer but a man highly educated in both medicine and the human anatomy: A highly trained and respected doctor surgeon! It's this theory alone that's to eventually lead Inspector Abberline straight to the very base of power of the mighty 19th Century British Empire! Queen Victoria's, Liz Moscrop, Buckingham Palace!High on opium, that was legal at the time, Inspector Abberline could sense things as a police detective that his fellow members of Scotland Yard couldn't. It was that extrasensory perception on Abberline's part that had him see the real reasons for the notorious 'Ripper' murders. It was also his addiction to opium that in the end did Abberline in before he could brake the 'Ripper' case wide open.Classic Gothic Horror movie that takes a number of real historical as well as mysterious incidents, the 'Jack the Ripper murders', and makes some sense of them. We do get to see,like Inspector Abberline, the real clues to the 'Ripper' identity and, which are far more important, who he was actually working for. The 'Ripper', in what the movie brought out, was not an ordinary killer emigrant and illiterate, in the English language, Jew from Czarist Russia or even an escaped lunatic from a mental institution. He was a very highly educated man who did his ghastly job of murder and dismemberment with a skill that would have taken years of practice at a major big city medical facility to achieve!Starting out with a blood-red sunset over the city of London's-circa 1888-crime ridden Whitechapel and Kensington Districts the film 'From Hell' accurately chronicles the murderous 'Jack the Ripper' rampage that terrorized London that fateful late summer and fall of 1888. We get to see how the 'Ripper's' murder of local prostitutes was not an act of murderous insanity but a well thought out plan, by those who controlled him, to rid any evidence connecting his victims, or one of them, to the British Royal Family.***SPOILERS*** In the end it was Inspector Abberline's bulldog-like determination that turned his superior at Scotland Yard Sir. Charles Warner, Ian Richardson, against him. Not that Abberline wasn't doing his job but, in exposing the reasons for the 'Ripper' killing, doing it far too well then he, and the power behind the British Throne, would have liked him to! Even though Mary Kelly, Heather Graham, is shown at the end of the film to have survived 'Jack the Ripper's' reign of terror she in fact was, as we saw earlier, the 'Ripper's' last and most shockingly dismembered murder victim! I couldn't figure out what the movie was trying to tell us in showing Mary back and alive and well in her native Ireland unless it was her soul not body who we were supposed to be seeing?",7,0,1,25 July 2009

Rocky," You Take My Heart Away
","'Rocky' both starts and ends in the boxing ring. We first see Rocky, Sylvester Stallone,in the ring fighting journeyman boxer Spider Rico, Pedro Lovell. After getting illegally butted by the Spider a mad and outraged Rocky pounds him into the ring and into defeat. Pushing 30 and with his best fighting days behind him Rocky works on the Phillie docks as a collector for local mob boss Gazzo, Joe Spinelli, to make ends meet. Even as that, collecting mob debts, Rocky is too kind and good natured, a real softy, to break peoples arms legs and thumbs who are late in paying up. With his life set as a low level hood, thats just what Rocky is a mob enforcer, and washed up as a professional boxer he had nothing to look forward to in the future. Meanwhile the World Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed, Carl Weathers, is out of opponents to defend his title against and needs a new act to attract a big crowd for his next payday in the ring. Appolo and the top promoter in the world of boxing Jergens, Thayer David, come up with this great idea that to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the United States, in 1976. Why not defend his championship against one of the descendent's of the man who discovered America Italian navigator Christopher Columbus. All at once the bleak future that was staring wash-up broken down club fighter Rocco Balboa became the once in a lifetime chance for proud Italian-America Rocky Balboa to show the world that he's not the bum or has been. Which everybody in the local boxing circles in Philidelpia thinks of him With the exception of his trainer Micky, Burgess Meredith. Rocky goes on the prove in the movie that he's a champ today as the champ that he always was of days past but never knew it. Stirring boxing film about the rags to riches story of a nobody, Rocky, who became a somebody in the ring against the heavyweight champ with nothing more then the guts and determination and those who stood behind him throughout the entire ordeal. Rocky trains and works himself into a championship caliber boxer to fight the fight of his life. Even in the end when he lost a close fifteen round decision to Appolo Creed he won not only the hearts but the respect of the whole boxing world as well as the world itself.Sylvester Stallone has never been able to top himself since he stared in 'Rocky' and I doubt that he ever will. 'Rocky' is a truly once in a lifetime movie and Stallone had just one once in a lifetime movie and he already used up his 'Rocky'. As good as the fight scenes are the movie is even more heart lifting and touching with Rocky's actions out of the ring. Micky who at first humiliated Rocky in public when he threw him out of the locker room and later wanted to train and manage Rocky for the big fight with Appolo and get the chance, like Rocky, to be a champ. Rocky after telling the old sick man off and practically throwing him out of his apartment runs out to apologizes for what he did and then accepts his offer and lets bygones be bygones between him and Micky. This was so effectively done with no duologue at all but you'd have to be dead or blind not to see and understand it. Rocky's feelings for Adrian, Talia Shire, was even more effective then any of Rocky's fight sequence in the movie. The shy Adrian who was considered by everyone including her drunk and bitter brother Paulie, Burt Young, a loser like Rocky. With Rocky's kind and sweet attention towards Adrian showed that she was as beautiful when she got over her insecurities as he was, when he got his confidence back, brave and courageous in the ring against the worlds undefeated Heavyweight Champ Appolo Creed. Working himself into shape with a tremendous uplifting sequence, to the movies theme song 'Gonna Fly Now', of Rocky hitting the speed and heavy bag doing one-handed push-ups and running his heart out along the docks crowded streets and railway yards of Phillie. Rocky finally at the end of his long run makes it to and climbed up the steps, two at a time, of the massive Philidelphia Museum of Art. Which earlier in the movie he after doing his morning roadwork almost collapsed on. Rocky was now ready for his place in movie history in his battle with World Heavyweight Champ Creed in the city of Philadelphia.Everyone involved in the film 'Rocky', Stallone Weathers Shire Young Meridith Spinlli etc. etc., their lives and their worlds would never ever be the same again.",9,4,7,12 December 2004
Rocky III," The eye of the tiger the thrill of the fight
","***SPOILERS**** After Rocky Balboa's winning the World Heavyweight Championship in his re-match drag out and knock down battle with 'the Master of Disater' Apollo Creed, Carl Weathers, he's given a hand picked string of second tier boxers by his concerned, in not having his fighter and meal ticket Rocky hurt, trainer/manager the Willy Mickey Goldmill, Burgess Meredith, to defend his hard won tidal against. In the background there's the hard hitting training and determined 230 pounds of fighting fury Clubber Lang, Mister T, mowing his way through the heavyweight ranks, like Iron Mike Tyson did before he got his title match, nipping like an out of control pit bull terrier at Rocky's feet.It's at an unavailing ceremony of the Rocky Balboa statue in downtown Philadelphia that Lang finally got his chance to meet face to face with Rocky not only taunting him about how scared he is of him and not willing to give him a shot at the heavyweight title. The mad and intimidating Lange really lets Rocky have it by even going so far as insulting his manhood by claiming that he, unlike Rocky, could satisfied his wife Yo Adrian, Talia Shire, both in and out of bed more then he ever could!With Rocky at first planing to retire from boxing he puts his retirement on hold to give the big bad as well as big mouth Lang a title shot against the better judgment off his manager Mickey. And as history or the film proved it turned out to be a major disaster for Rocky Balboa. He gets clobbered by Lang in two round leaving him both defeated as well as punch drunk. It was also not long after the match with Lang that his friend and manager Mickey who was knocked cold by a crazed and uncontrollable Lang before the fight with Rocky suddenly passed away!Now down in the dumps and the laughing stock of all the entire sports world especially after his wild and bizarre charity match with professional wrestler the 7 foot tall 350 pounds Thunderlips, Hulk Hogan, who's billed as 'Every Womens Dream' Rocky goes into a deep depression. In him feeling that his entire boxing career that he was so proud of was nothing but a joke. It's non other then his former bitter opponent Apollo Creed who comes to Rocky's rescue when nobody else even his wife Yo Adrian and struggling to stay sober friend and brother in law Paulie, Burt Young, could. With Apollo taking Rocky under his wings and putting him through a vigorous and ghetto like, in a Watts L.A boxing gym, training regiment he got Rocky in the best shape of his life to take on Lang in a re-match where he wasn't taken seriously at all by Lang or the boxing and sport world.****SPOILERS**** probably the best and shortest,three rounds, fight sequence up to then far better the the previous two Rocky movies with the title fight taken place at New York's Madison Square Garden has Rocky charge out of his corner at the opening bell and box instead of slug it out, like he did in their first match, with Clubber Lang easily taking, on all cards , the first round. In the second round Lang got over his confusion and started to punch his way through Rocky's defenses with Lang's devastating punches getting to Rocky flooring him a number of times. It's then when it looked like curtains for Rocky that he went on the defensive letting Lang do all the swinging until by the middle of the third round his devastating punches, that can poke holes through a brick wall, were nothing more but harmless cream puffs. It was Lang not Rocky who ended up defeating himself by punching himself out so badly that by the time Rocky opened up on him with his left hooks and straight rights that he was left punchy and rubbed armed as well as flat on his back and on the mat for a ten count. With Lang so exhausted and punched out even a light tap from Rocky's old lady Yo Adrian would have done the job as well.P.S Now with his title back Rocky has one favor to do for his friend Apollo who gave him back that hungry mean and lean 'Eye of the Tiger' attitude that he needed to defeat Lang. And in an empty gym's boxing ring, probably the famous Gleason's Gym in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, the two square off in their unannounced rubber match to see who's the best. And as Rocky & Apollo are about to let loose with straight rights and left hooks the screen freezes leaving it up to us in the audience to imagine just what the ultimate and final results of that bout would be!",7,1,2,6 July 2013
Psycho," Are there still any vacancies at the Bates Motel?
","(Some Spoilers) Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror thriller about murder and madness at the deadly and infamous Bates Motel managed by the weird but seemingly harmless son of the motel owner Mrs. Bates Norman, Anthony Perkins. The film 'Psycho' starts out inside a darkened hotel room on a broiling Friday afternoon in December in the city of Phoenix Arizona. Marion Crane and Sam Loomis, Janet Leigh and John Gavin, have just finished off an afternoon quickie as they both get dressed to get back to their individual jobs after their lunch break. Depressed at having to meet and make love in the secrecy of a hotel room instead of at home like a married couple is getting both Marion and Sam very upset but they don't have the money to get married as well as raise a family. With Marion having a job as a secretary and Sam as a warehouse manager and also being very deeply in debt. Marion later that afternoon is called into the office of her boss George Lowery, Vaughn Taylor, and given some $40,000.00 in cash from a client of his Tom Cassidy, Frank Albertson,to put away at the local bank for the weekend. It's then that something clicks in Marion's mind where she decides to steal the money and use it to skip town and later marry Sam. Trading in her old car for a new one at a car dealership with $700.00 of the stolen cash Marion drives out west to California and as night falls it starts to rain very heavily and with the visibility next to zero she goes off the main highway on to a small country road that leads to the Bates Motel. Getting a room from Norman Bates at the motel Norman starts to become friendly and falls for the pretty sweet as well as obviously distressed Marion. This makes Norman's old and infirm mother Mrs.Bates very angry with him for not paying any attention towards her. Mrs. Bates also develops a very vicious and violent hatred towards Marion for what she thinks is her stealing Norman away from her.Later in her motel room Marion has seconds thoughts about her taking the $40,000.00 and plans to return it the next day to her employer back in Phoenix after having a good nights sleep at the motel but the bitter and vengeful Mrs. Bates has other ideas. Horrific film that has you at the edge of your seat and by the end falling off it. With the murderous Mrs. Bates on a knife wielding rampage attacking and slashing Marion as she's taking a shower leaving her to bleed to death on the floor of the bathtub. The shower scene is one of the most terrifying horror sequences ever put on film. The scene slowly builds itself up as the crazed Mrs. Bates enters Marion's room and creeps up to her in the shower. Quickly pulling the shower curtains apart Mrs. Bates lays into Marion with a large kitchen knife that had people in movie houses back them, 1960, choke on their popcorn and candy bars. Alfred Hitchcock set the scene up in a deliberately slow and deadly pace but when it exploded it left those watching, like poor Marion, in a state of first shock and then sheer terror. Even more effective, but not as popular with the movie going public, is when Mrs. Bates confronts private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who was hired to find Marion,at the top of the stairs in the Bates house. All at once when you, and Det. Arbogast, never expected it Mrs. Bates lashes her knife into Det. Arbogast face cutting it open. As Det. Arbogast falls to the bottom of the staircase Mrs. Bates pounces on him, like a cat, and savagely finishes him off. This all happened so fast that you, like Arbogast, didn't even have enough time to anticipate it which made it that much more effective. It later turns out that the insane Mrs. Bates had already murdered a number of people, before she murdered both Marion and Det. Arbogast, over the years and had them and their cars sunk in a nearby lake with the help of her willing son Norman to hide the evidence. The shock to end all shocks comes near the end of the movie when Marion's sister Lila, Vera Miles, goes down to the basement of the Bates house and finds out just who and what Mrs. Bates really is and who was the real person behind the bloody and brutal murders at the Bates Motel.",9,3,5,31 October 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Year of the Devil
","(There are Spoilers) One of the best horror movies ever made with almost no blood or splatters scenes at all with the exception of Terry, Victoria Vetri, jumping, off camera, to her death form the seventh floor of the Bramford Building. 'Rosemary' Baby' has to do with the most darkest fears one can conjure up in a movie book as well as in one's own mind; The return of Satan-the Devil-on earth and everything that goes along with him.It's early October 1965 and the Pope, Pope Paul VI, has made a historical visit to the US and is in the process of giving a sermon, to some 60,000 people, at New York's Yankee Stadium. It's also the time designated by a coven of Devil worshiping witches for the Devil's offspring, to be named Adrian, to be conceived by the unsuspecting and Catholic observant Rosemary Woodhouse, Mia Farrow.Since Rosemary and her actor husband Guy, John Cassavetes, moved into the creepy Bramford Building they've become very friendly with the elderly couple who lives next door to their apartment Roman and Minnie Castevet, Sidney Blackman & Ruth Roman. Even though Rosemary is not that taken in by the Castevets eccentric and somewhat wired behaviors her husband Guy is. Guy a struggling actor was desperately trying to get a part in a play that the far more talented Donald Baumgart, Tony Curtis, got. After Guy's involvement with the Castevets Baumgart suddenly lost his sight opening the door for another actor to replace him: Guy Woodhouse!The movie starts to grow and accelerate, together with Rosemary's pregnancy, in both tension as well as curiosity as she becomes very frail and sickly as the day of the 'blessed event', June 28, 1966, is soon to arrive. Feeling that something just isn't right Rosmary has been haunted since her night of conception, October 5/6 1965, it that she feels that it's wasn't Guy who fathered her now soon to be born child but the Devil or Satan,played by Clay Tanner, himself!Despite the movie's many subplots, all centered around Rosemary's pregnancy and birth to her child, the film is never confusing in that they, the subplots, all come together in the film's final and shocking ten or so minutes! The Woodhouse's at first had no idea to what evil existed right at their front doorsteps! Soon they would become in their associations with the Castevets the very central, and rotten, core of it!It was family friend Edward 'Hutch' Hutchins, Maurice Evens, who knew not only the history of the eerie Bramford Building but that of one of its infamous tenants Steven Marcato. It was also that knowledge that lead to Hutch falling into a deep coma that he never came out of!****SPOILER ALERT**** It was Marcato who was killed by an angry New York mob some 80 years ago for secretly practicing witchcraft! It was also Marcato who had a son who had since changed, or rearranged, his name and became a man of the world as well as, in his many travels, secretly gotten himself involved with the occult like his father did! That person is non other then the Woodhouse's kindly and harmless looking next door neighbor Roman Castevet himself!Making a pact with the Devil has its price and the price that Guy Woodhouse paid for bringing him, in Guy allowing Satan to rape his wife Rosemary, out of the depths of Hell and into the unsuspecting world above was more that it was worth. Guy's career in both TV and the movies, as well as the theater, took off like a shot but in reality he ended up damned for all eternity. As for poor Rosemany in the end after seeing what her new born son really looked like, and what he represented, it was both her goodness, in Rosemary's Christian beliefs, and maternal instincts that eventually overrode her horror and revulsion in what she was forced, by her husband Guy and the Castevets, to unknowingly participate in. As the movie ends Rosemary is heard humming the lullaby theme of the movie as she's gently and tenderly rocking the 'cute' little Devil, her son Adrian, to sleep!",10,10,14,16 October 2008
Downfall," All Is Lost!
","Berlin April 1945: The Red Army has launched it's last great offensive of the Second World War with a massive armored and infantry assault on the German capital. Deep inside a bunker underneath the German Reichstag is the German Fhurer Adolf Hitler, Bruno Ganz,and his general staff conducting the last desperate defense of the city but time is quickly running out with even the most fanatical and optimistic of them, with the exception of Hitler, know that the end is near and are looking to somehow escape from this hell on earth or at least negotiate a surrender with the attacking Soviets forces. It's these historic days during the spring of 1945 that are covered in the movie 'Downfall'.Explosive and blood-splattering film with an Acdemy Award caliber performance by Bruno Ganz as the German leader Adolf Hitler as his nation is being clobbered with daily and nightly one thousand plane bombing raids from the air and with millions of allied troops, on two fronts,swarming across it's borders on land putting an end to the Third Reich that he brought into power in Germany back in 1933. The total pandemonium that struck that city is realistically and graphically depicted in the movie that's based on the memories of Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara, who was working for him in that capacity since 1942.One of the best movies about Hitler ever made has him shown in a very different light then the usual portrayals that were used to seeing him in the scores of films made about Hitler, and WWII, over the years. Wild threatening and hysterical towards his generals when things aren't going right, which in the movie was almost all the time, Hitler showed his 'human side' when it came to his personal staff. Insisting that they leave the city before it fell to the dreaded Red Army and also being grateful to them when they refuse and wanted to stay, and kill themselves, along with him when the end came.There's a great scene in the bunker when Hitler realizes that the 'great offensive' that he expected by German General Steiner's 9th Army, to smash the Soviets and throw them out of Berlin, never materialized because he, Steiner, didn't have the men and tanks to do the job. Completely losing it and letting his generals have it Hitler at last finally realized, with the later defection of his two top honchos SS leader Himmler & second in command Goering, that the war was lost. Hitler then instead of trying to escape from the doomed city decided to stay at his post, as the German Chief of State, until it's defense was no longer possible then end it all by putting a bullet in his head.Terrifying scenes with blood and guts and body parts flying in all directions with even the Germans themselves, the Army and Nazi Gestapo, shooting hundreds of German soldiers and civilians who were trying to flee the city, to save their lives, for disobeying orders and not standing and fighting to the last man and woman like their Fhurer ordered them to.With all the horrors in the movies 'Downfall' the one that struck me most, even though it was very minor compared to the rest of the carnage in the film, was the murder by the Nazi Misnister of Propaganda Joseph Gobbels and his wife Magda, Ulrich Matters & Corinna Harfouch, of their six young children by poisoning them as they were asleep. Determined to both kill themselves the Gobbels' didn't even want their children to survive the war saying that there's no reason for them to live in a world without National Socialism or their 'beloved Fhurer' Adolf Hitler or uncle Adolf as he was efficiently called by them. the movie 'Downfall' showed more then anything else how right the Union Civil War General Sherman was in his famous statement 'War is Hell'.",10,2,4,31 July 2005
The Reader," The lady with the little dog
","(There are Spoilers) 15 year-old Michael Berg, David Cross, is suddenly taken ill on the streets of Neustadt Germany and nurses back to help by a total stranger who seems to have no one but herself to look after. The time is spring 1958 and the stranger in question is 36 year old trolley ticket stamper Hanna Schmitz, Kate Winslet.It's later when Michael was fully recovered, from Scarlett Fever, that he came back to thank Hanna for all she did for him that he started to fall in love with her. So much so that the two had a hot and sizzling love affair throughout the entire summer of 1958 until Hanna, by leaving town, broke it off. It's now eight years later, 1965, and Michael now in law collage is sent together with his fellow law students by his teacher Prof. Rohl, Bruno Ganz, to see how the law is administrated in the new German Republic. The trial that Michael is to attend and study has to do with a number of former SS women guards at the notorious Aushwitz concentration camp.To Michael's shock and utter surprise the major defendant at the trail is non other then his former lover, and the women who saved his life, Hanna Schmitz! All this is recounted in 1995 by a grown up, and now a lawyer in Berlin, Michael Berg, played by a middle age Ralph Fiennes.Michael has been haunted all his adult life in not being able to come to Hanna's aid like she did for him when she needed him most, at her trial, with vital information that would have well speared her a lifetime behind bars in a German prison. Not that Hanna was totally innocent of the charges against her in having sent a number of unfit for work women inmates to their ultimate deaths at the Auschwitz concentration camp. But it was the major charge against Hanna that she took full responsibility for, and given the harshest sentence by the court, that she in fact had nothing at all to do with. Hanna's personally writing out and signing the order that caused the deaths of hundreds of Jewish women held captive in an abandoned church.Hanna as we, as well as Michael who would read books for her, all could see very early in the movie was a functional illiterate. There was no way Hanna could write out a long two or three page order that in effect sent some 300 women prisoners to their death in a locked up church, that was later fire bombed by allied aircraft, since she couldn't even write her own name! The most shocking thing of all is that Hanna felt no remorse in the crimes that she committed during the war, she was only doing her job, but felt greatly embarrassed to the point of getting life, instead of four years, behind bars in her keeping the public from knowing that she couldn't either read or write!It took years for Michael to get up enough courage to finally go and see Hanna in prison which by then, with Michael's corresponding with her through the mail, she did teach herself to read and write. But by that time Hanna also realized what a monster she was during the war and even with her about to be paroled from prison, after some 20 years behind bars, she came to realize that there was no life left for her outside or behind prison bars.Academy Award caliber performances by both Ralph Fiennes and 18 year old David Kross as Michael Berg as well as the multi-talented Kate Winslet as the confused, in what she did in the war, and tragic, in what she ultimately did to herself,Hanna Schmitz. There's also worth mentioning in the movie actress Lena Olin playing both Rose and her daughter, some twenty years later, Ilana Mather. It was to Ilana, who's mother was the only survivor of the bombed out church, that Hanna through Michael, as her personal lawyer, left all her earthly belongings. Even though Ilana couldn't keep the money that Hanna left for her, she told Michael to donate it to a hospital burn unit, she did in fact take the colorful tea tin that it was kept in. It reminded Ilana of better times when as a young girl she kept her valuables in a similarly tea tin before the outset of WWII.",8,1,1,10 February 2009
Lord of War," There's nothing illegal about what I did!
","***SPOILERS*** On target and chilling movie about he dirty business of arms dealing with Nicolas Cage who personally financed the film as Ukrainian, passing for Jewish, immigrant Yuri Orlov who realized the American dream in making it big but not the way he at first expected to. Seeing the deadly gun play among the Russian mob in his crime infested neighborhood in Brighten Beach Brooklyn Yuri decided to get in on the action. Not by joining any Russian/Unkainian gang but in providing them with the guns to kill themselves. It's not long before Uri works his way up from providing local street gangs with guns but entire nations, mostly in Africa and the Middle-East, with not only guns but missiles hand grenades tanks and even attack helicopters to not only wipe out their enemies but their own people.Yuri for his part stays away from the action or bloodshed and just concentrates on the money, tens of millions of dollars, that he gets for selling his merchandise of death acting as if he's an legitimate businessman making and honest buck to support himself and his family. Always a step ahead of US Government ATF Agent Jack Valentine,Ethan Hawke, Yuri seems untouchable from the law both in the USA and the International or World Court. But he's not immune from those that he deals with, a bunch of lowlifes like himself, to whom the law means nothing to. It's when Yuri who was later trying to go straight by cleaning up his act, and getting out of the arms dealing business, is contacted by a former client of his Monrovia Dictator Andre Baptiste, Eamonn Walker, with an offer that he couldn't refuse that his life turned upside down. Yuri is blackmailed to supply Baptiste with modern arms and ammunition in order to massacre his own people who don't support his bloody regime or he'll give Agent Valentine all the evidence he needs to hang him. It was in fact Baptiste who forced Yuri to personally murder, with a .357 magnum, one of his biggest competitors in the arms selling business Simeon Weisz, Ian Holm, and that alone can have him sent up the river for life. That far more then the thousands of innocent people who were slaughter by ruthless dictators like Baptiste whom he sold his merchandise of death to.Having his kid brother Vitaly, Jared Leto, a recovering cocaine addict come along with him to Monrovia to iron out a deal with Baptiste things go dangerously wrong for Yuri. Vitaly who incredibly enough had no idea of what Baptiste was all about, a ruthless bloodthirsty maniac, saw his soldiers machete a mother and infant, who tried to escape, to death outside one of his concentration camps! Realizing what he'll do to his people with the modern and state of the art arms that his brother is selling him Vitaly flips out and ends up, with a live hand grenade, destroying half of the arms shipment Yuri brought for him as well as getting himself gunned down by one of Baptiste soldiers! It's then that Yuri realizes that there's now no turning back from the road that he choose in life. And now with him disowned by his friends and family,in finding out what he's in to, Yuri like a puppet on a string goes back to selling arms to anyone or any third world country who's willing to pay for them. With him now knowing, as if he didn't from the start, that for the time being until it gets someone better to replace him with Yuri is totally immune from being arrested and prosecuted by his own government for what he's doing because he has its full backing and support in doing the work, as a middleman, that it doesn't want to be accused of. Honest and disturbing movie in what's really going on in the world at large in the proxy and civil wars and conflicts that are being supported under the table by the likes of arm dealers like Yuri Orlov with the full support of the five permanent members of the UN Security Console the USA UK France Russia & China who's job it is to promote world peace. But who are in fact the biggest arms dealers, legal & illegal, on the planet! P.S Check out former Soviet Premiere Nikhail Gorbachnev in a cameo appearance in the film announcing the dissolving of the nation that he's in charge of-The Soviet Union- as a Christmas present to the world on Christmas day 1991.",8,0,1,11 August 2012
Platoon," We didn't fight the enemy we fought ourselves, and the enemy was in us
","****SPOILERS**** 'Platoon' is every bit as powerful an anti-war movie like 'All Quite on the Western Front' the film is unlike that 1930's anti-war classic. Where the hero was eager to enter the war and fight and die for his country and felt that the war was justified. The hero in 'Platoon' Pvt. Chris Taylor, Charlie Sheen, had no doubt at all about the war that he entered as a green replacement in the battered and bloodied Bravo Company 25th Infantry. Chris felt that the war in Vietnam was a necessary evil at best or an unnecessary waste of lives, American and Vietnamese, at worse. Volunteering for combat duty Chris felt that as a more or less privileged young American he had to pull his own weight and not stay out of the service of his country at it's time of need and dropped out of collage, were he was safe from being drafted for military service, to do that. During his time serving in one of Bravo company's platoons Chris realized that not only was he at war with the dreaded and deadly North Vietnamese regular soldiers and Vietcong troops and guerrilla fighters he was at war with the men in his own platoon as well as himself. Graphically violent as well as penetratingly thought-provoking Vietnam War film by director Oliver Stone that not only shows the war in Vietnam but any war for what it really is: Hell On Earth. Were given the story of the actions of the Bravo Company platoon from the thoughts and writings of young Pvt.Chris Taylor that takes place from the late summer of 1967 to around the time of the Tet offensive in January to March 1968. Which witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting in the war. By the end of the movie Chris' platoon was cut to pieces in a series of ambushes night attacks and fire fights and finally a major North Vietnamese assault that breached Bravo company's forward perimeter in the Vietnamese jungle. The enemy forces overran and virtually wiped out the entire infantry company which was saved, in a last act of desperation, by a USAF bombardment of it's own positions. The film shows that war, no matter how right or wrong it is, dehumanizes and brutalizes all those involved in it.We see Chris who went from an innocent young man who never fired a shot in anger, if at all, before he entered the US military to a hardened and cold-blooded killer in the less then six months that he was in Vietnam. There's also a powerful story between the two sergeants who ran the platoon that Chris was in. Sgt. Elias Grodin, Willem DaFoe, and Staff/Sgt. Bob Barnes, Tom Berenger. The two seemed to be more at war with each other then with the enemy Vietcong and NVR. Sgt. Grodin was on the sensitive side who tried to keep at least some of his humanity in light of the madness swirling all around him and was by far the most likable person in the movie. Staff/Sgt. Barnes was a horribly scared psychotic killer who took no prisoners, military or civilian, and was both feared and hated by almost everyone in his platoon. As brutal as Staff/Sgt. Barnes was he never the less motivated his men to fight and survive in the savage jungle combat that they encountered all through the film. It was Staff/Sgt. Barnes brutish treatment of innocent Vietnamese civilians that the platoon came in contact with that split the two, Barnes & Grodin, up into enemy camps. In one of the most gripping scenes in the movie when Sgt. Grodin was lost in the jungle after an enemy ambush he's spotted by Staff/Sgt. Barnes. You can see by the look in Sgt. Grodin's eyes how happy he is to see him and you get the impression that they'll both make up and bury the hatchet and once again become friends. Yet just by looking in the crazed stare coming out of Staff/Sgt. Barnes eyes you, and Sgt. Grodin, knew that was not to happen as he put a barrage of slugs into Grodin's chest from his M16.'Platoon' is one of those movies about war that really hits the nail on the head about the horrors of war and that the most righteous of all wars are those wars that are never fought at all.",8,0,1,21 August 2004
Raging Bull," I've done a lot of bad things in my life Joey, maybe now I'ts coming back to me
","(There Are Spoilers) Unlike most professional prize-fighters who keep their aggressions inside of the boxing-ring and outside of it would rather walk away from a fight then participate or provoke one boxer, and later Middleweight Champion,Jake La Matta, Robert Di Niro, was the exact opposite. Brutal rude petty and jealous and combative of anyone who as much as looked at his pretty wife Vickie, Cathy Moriarty, La Matta did more fighting outside the ring then in it. Fighting his way up the ranks to get a shot at the title 20 year-old La Matta is defeated for the first time in his career on September 24, 1941 in Cleveland after he knocked his opponent Jimmy Reeves, Flyod Anderson, out cold. Reeves was saved from being counted out by the bell and was declared the winner which started a full-scale riot in the Cleveland arena. Quickly recovering from his loss La Matta went on to defeat the undefeated Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes), who bet La Matta twice before,on February 26, 1943 in a 10 round decision in Detroit, Robinson's home town. Assured that he'd get a shot at the Middleweight Title LaMatta had to wait some six years, and throw a fight to journeyman boxer Billy Fox(Eddie Mustafa Muhammad) in New York on November 11, 1947,to get it.The movie 'Raging Bull' concentrates more on Jake LaMatta's personal then professional boxing life and we see just what kind of a Neanderthal and brute he was to the people he came in contact with especially his wife Vickie and younger brother Joey, Joe Pesci.Suffering from an inferior complex and afraid that Vickie would leave him for another man, like he left his first wife for Vickie,La Matta constantly beat and berated Vickie to the point of not just slapping her around but catching Vickie flush right in the face with one of his punches that knocked her out.Even Joey wasn't speared from Jake's brutality and suspicions of fooling around with Vickie when he savagely attacked and bet him, right in front of Joey's wife and children. This lead Joey to never talk to Jake again until almost ten years later. La Matta finally got a shot at the title on June 16, 1949 in Detroit and defeated the Middleweight Champ Frenchman Marcel Cerdan, Louis Raftis, when he couldn't answer the bell for the 10th round.Defending his hard won title a year later against fellow Frenchman Laurent Dauthuille (Johnny Turner), Cerdan died in a plane crash before his re-match with La Matta,on September 13, 1950 in NYC Jake was about to lose the fight on points. It's then that he exploded with a fury of punches in the 15th round and knocked out Dauthuille with only 13 seconds left in the fight.For all intents and purposes Jake La Matta's boxing career ended, he official retired in 1954, on February 14, 1951, known in the boxing world as the St. Valentine Day massacre. It's then when he fought and lost his Middleweight crown to his arch-rival Sugar Ray Robinson in a brutal 13 round battle. La Matta bloodied and beaten was still standing on his feet when the fight was stopped by the ring referee.No longer able to box professionally La Matta opened up a nightclub, the Jake La Matta, in Miami Florida but trouble still followed him. La Matta was busted on a vice rap, that landed him in the Dade County Jail. This happened when he allowed a 14 year-old girl Mary Albee, who told LaMatta that she was 21, drink at his club and then introduced her to a number of his friends.The movie 'Raging Bull' ends in NYC in 1964 with a pudgy and punch-drunk Jake La Matta, alone with everyone that he knew in his hay-day as a boxing champ deserting him, rehearsing his nightclub act which is nothing more then a parody of his life. An amazing Acadamy Award performance by Robert Di Niro as the edgy and uncontrollable Jake La Matta who had to gain some 50 pounds, going from a fighting trim of 165 to over 200 lbs, to make the role of Jake La Matta believable. The film 'Raging Bull' also made a star out of the 36 year-old Joe Pesci who was about to call it quits on his acting career until Robert Di Niro himself demanded that he play his tragic, and somewhat unusable, brother Joey.",9,3,5,12 November 2005
The Deer Hunter," Dear Hunter:

The next day Steven and his two close friends Michael & Nick, Robert De Niro & Christopher Walken, spend their their last day together hunting deer in the Pennsylvania woods before being drafted into the US Army.Michael is a crack shot when it comes to bringing down a deer and proves it when he's the only one of the group that also included fellow steel workers Stanley and Axel, John Cazale & Chuck Aspegren. living by the rule 'One shot is what it's all about' Michael puts that into practice in his hunting deers, he never has to shoot twice to make a kill. Later in the movie Michael sees that that motto of his can also effect him and his friends just like the deers he's been hunting all his adult life. Sent to Vietnam as a member the elite 101th Airborne we see Michael run into both Nick and Steven during a communist assault on a village that their defending. A moment later the three, together with a number of Vietnamese villages, having been captured by the Viet Cong are being used in a morbid game of Russian Roulette by their Communist Vietcong captors.Steven who refused to play the Vetcong death game is thrown into a underwater cage in the Mekong River where he's attacked by dozens of hungry and vicious water rats who almost chew his legs off. Both Michael & Nick are a bit luckier by playing Russian Roulett since Michael takes the chance by encouraging the Vietcong leader to put three bullets into the gun chamber not the usual one! Michael playing the odds that his chances, together with Nick, is 50/50 he'll have if he's lucky three slugs to put between his commie torturers eyes and be able to put them out and escape with both Nick & Steven. As dangerous as an idea was it worked with the Vietcong getting all that's coming to them, in bullets and rifle butts, from a mad as hell Michael and even madder Nick.If was later that the three friends are separated during the fighting and Michael is the only one who comes back home to Clairton Penn. in more or less one piece. Michael later finds Steven in a veterans hospital with both his legs amputated from the wounds he suffered in the Vietnam War and that Nick is categorized by he US Army as either AWOL dead or missing in South VietnamSearching for Nick, whom he promised to never leave behind, Michael finds that Steven at the Vet. hospital has been secretly getting scores of $100.00 bills over the last few months from someone in Saigon? That someone turned out to be the missing Nick! Michael travels 12,000 miles back to Vietnam to find and rescue Nick but there's just two hitches; first being able to get into South Vietnem with the country about to fall to the Communist North Vietnamese and second finding Nick and then seeing if he want's to be rescued and brought home in the first place.Gut-wrenching movie about friendship in war and in peacetime with Michael trying to put the pieces of his life back together after he was tortured and de-humanized by his war experiences. Michael became so disgusted and angry with killing that when out hunting he couldn't even lift his rifle to aim at and shoot a deer back home in Penn., a sport which he used to enjoy more then anything else.Going back to 'Nam' in the spring of 1975 as the US supported South Vietnamese government was on the brink of being overthrown, with what little US personnel left at the US embassy in Saigon about to be air-lifted out of the country, Michael finds Nick playing for high stakes, his life, the brutal and inhuman game that took away his sanity while being held captive by the Vietcong years ago; Russian Roulette. Almost unwatchable final 15 minutes as Michael tries to get poor and heavily drug addicted Nick to come back home with him. Michael even goes as far as of playing a game of 'Spin the Bullet' himself to get Nick out of his self-destructive state. Nick had been lucky all these months in the gambling dens of Siagon winning thousands of dollars defying the odds of getting his brains blown out. This time, like Michael always said, 'One shot is what It's all about' and it was that one and last shot or bullet that eventually did Nick in.One of the best movies about war ever made that shows it for what it is 'Hell on Earth' with a young, 28 year old, and at the time unknown Meryl Streep as Nick's, and and now Michael, long suffering girlfriend Linda. Linda together with Michael Steven and his wife Angela, and all of the friends that Nick left behind in Clairton, attending Nick's funeral sadly say goodbye to him. Later Nicks friends and family solemnly sitting together at the dinner table end the film singling 'God Bless America' in what has to be one of the most touching and heart-rendering scenes ever put on film. P.S Michael did indeed keep his promise to Nick, he didn't leave him behind.",8,17,34,1 March 2006
The Sixth Sense," Top Psychological Thriller; When the analyzer becomes the analyzed
","M. Night Shyamaina's 'The Sixth Sense' has come a long way since movies about psychological issues hit the big screen back in 1945 with Alfred Hitchcock's 'Spellbound' and shows how much we learned about the subject since then. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis, is on top of the world a success in his chosen profession, child psychology, and married to a beautiful and caring wife Anna, Olivia Williams. At the beginning of the film Dr. and Mrs. Crowe down in the living room drinking themselves almost drunk with wine. Celebrating Dr. Crowe being awarded the Mayor's Citation for Professional Excellence Award from the city of Philadelphia. Going up the stairs to the bedroom Dr. Crowe sees that the window is broken and there's someone in the house. When he looks towards the bathroom Dr. Crowe sees that the light is turned on and there's someone in there. Dr. Crowe trying to get the intruder who's very emotionally disturbed at ease by talking to him finds out that he was one of his patients that he treated who went wrong Vincent Gray, Donnie Wahlberg. Before Dr. Crowe can go any further Vincent pulls out a gun and shoots him point blank and then turns the gun on himself.The movie then jumps some six months later when Dr. Crowe recovered and back on the job is assigned to his first patient since being shot. He's to treat a six year-old boy Cole Sear, Haley Joel Osment, who's having problems at school and at home. Cole can't get along not only with his classmates and his teachers but also with his single parent mother Lynn Sear, Toni Collette. Cole withdrawn and quite and he gets scared and frightened for apparently no reason when he's looking at seemingly harmless people and places or at nothing at all. Dr. Crowe starts to talk to Cole as he tries to analyze him and to the Dr.'s surprise little Cole seems to come out of his shell. Cole not only responds to him in an unafraid manner to which he doesn't do to any of his classmates and teachers, whom he knows a lot more the Dr. Crowe, he also also confides in him to what his fears are. Young Cole has hallucinations that, as he tells a very interested and concerned Dr. Crowe, he 'sees dead people'. He sees them everywhere, in school, in the streets even at home. He sees them everywhere he looks and there are some that don't even know that there dead. Dr. Crowe at first feels that he's getting through to young Cole and puts all of his attention and efforts to curing him of his psychosis. What he doesn't realize is that the attention that he's paying to Cole is jeopardizing his whole life by neglecting his wife and his friends. As well any other cases of child psychological disorders that he may have to examine and cure in the future.You begin to wonder why Dr. Crowe is paying so much attention to Cole? Is it that Cole reminds him of Vincent Gray whom he failed so many years ago which ended with him being shot and Vincent killing himself. Is Dr. Crowe afraid that young Cole if not cured will end up the same way? Did that terrible incident at the beginning of the movie damage Dr. Crowe so severely that it completely wrecked his ability as a child psychologist to do his work and made him need psychological help himself? What really surprised me about 'The Sixth Sense' was the quality of Bruce Willis acting in the movie even more then the already legendary, although it's been only four years since the film was released back in 1999, surprise ending. Bruce Willis carried the movie with an academy award caliber performance without a shoot-out explosion or car chase or almost any action at all which Bruce Willis movies are noted for. Willis played the exact opposite a role that he would usually play and excelled in it.You also have to give top acting credit to the young Haley Joel Osment who played the young boy Cole Sear who held his own and sometime even eclipsed Willis in every scene that they were in together. If 'The Sixth Sense' showed anything besides being a top psychological thriller is that when Bruce Willis is too old and unconvincing to play action hero parts he'll still have a very bright future in films that would only require acting.",9,0,0,14 October 2003
Casino," throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car
","***SPOILERS*** Almost three hours long with some 150 character references or credits in it the film 'Casino' has to do with the rise and fall of big time Las Veges operator and Tangiers Casino manager Sam 'Ace' Rothstein, Robert De Niro, who's fate remains uncertain until the movie is just about over.We see Sam in 1983 getting in his car and then blown to pieces as a bomb exploded as soon as he turned on the key to start the engine going. As Sam is put, by the explosion, in some kind of state of suspended animation, floating aimlessly in outer space, he tells us in flashback what lead to him getting into the situation that we find him now in. It all had to do with Sam's boyhood friend Mafia made-man Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci, who was brought to Vegas by the mob to be put in charge of the casino's security. It was Nicky who's strong armed actions like beating and clubbing the customers fond cheating, as well as showing disrespect, on the floor of the casino that brought the heat, cops, as well as local politicians down on Ace Rothstein. This made things hot for Ace who with his criminal record now being scrutinized,instead of being looked the other way, to see if he can qualify to have a license to run the casino.Things get even worse for Ace when Nicky after being banned by the State Casino Commission from ever stepping into a Las Vegas casino or gambling establishment still pesters him about getting his job back! That would cost Ace his job as casino manager for just associating with the blood thirsty little psycho. Things really come to a head when Nicky starts to warm up to Ace's old lady ex Las Vegas showgirl and part time hooker Ginger McKenna, Sharon Stone. Ginger is also still involved with her pimp ex-boyfriend Lester Diamond, James Woods, who's been leaching off her 2 million dollars in cash & jewelry that Ace gave her as a wedding present. This lead Lester to get worked over in a restaurant parking lot by Ace's goons with a terrified Ginger forced to watch.As Ginger got more and more into snorting coke she became easy pickings for Nicky who got her to become his squeeze or woman in him supplying her, through his mob connections, with the white stuff. Soon Ginger got so hooked on both drugs and Nicky that she started to abuse her and Ace's 9 year old daughter Amy, Erika Von Tagen, by tying her up in bed as the two were out at night painting the town red behind Ace's back. It's when the word came back to Nicky's boss back east that he's fooling around with Ace's wife it was decided that he, despite being a made man in the Mafia, was more trouble them he was worth. A hit was set up for both Nicky and his equally psychotic kid brother deli owner Dominick, Philip Surian,who likes to spit in his costumers food especially cops whom he was forced to pay off. In a secret meeting site held in a deserted Indiana corn field both Nicky & Dominick were met by mobster and good friend Frank Marino,Frank Vincent, and his boys to talk over business. What was later to happen to the two sadistic creeps is far too brutal and shocking to be put down on paper!***SPOILERS*** When the film 'Casino' is just about over we finally get to see what exactly happened to the what looked like at first the late and dismembered Samuel 'Ace' Rothstein who's doing all the narrations in the movie. But by then with all the action and sub-plots in the film Ace's fate wasn't anything to write home, or in a movie review, about anyway! By then he was yesterdays news in him only being worth while to wrap fish or line your kiddie box with.",6,2,2,5 March 2012
Heat," Cash of the Titans?
","(There are Spoilers) Overlong and mindless crime drama that has to do with this master bank robber Neil McCauley, Robert De Niro, who becomes the object of L.A police Let. Vincent Hanna's, Al Pacino, obsession, The two get involved in a battle of wits and bullets that turns the city of Las Angeles into Baghdad Iraq by the time the movie 'Heat' is finally over. Inolved in a number of high profile robberies Neil has become a bit soft in his life long career in crime. Neil is planing to pull off just one more multi-million dollar bank robbery and then call it quits and retire.Let.Hanna on McCauley's tail want's to prevent him from pulling off his grand slam bank holdup but is always stymied as McCauley is one step ahead of him. Even though after the first armor car robbery, that resulted in the three armor car guards getting shot to death by McCauley & Co., all McCauley and his gang did was do each other in. As well as being, or trying to be, double-crossed by big time mob money launderer Roger Van Zant,William Fichtner, who's over one million dollars in untraceable Bearer Bonds the McCauley gang took in the armor car robbery and attempted to sell back to him at .60 on the dollar. This after Van Zant got back all the money that he lost in stolen bonds back which were covered by his insurance company.Were then bombarded with both McCauleys and Hannas personal life that goes on for almost an hour like a day time TV soap opera and really has very little to to with the movie's basic theme about crime and punishment in the streets and airport of L.A. All that confuses and bores you to the point that your almost put to sleep watching it.Who cares about Hanna's relationship with his old lady Justine, Diane Venora, and who she sleeps with! Even Let. Hanna doesn't seem too concerned he's only angry that Justine's lover Ralph, Xander Berkeley, has the nerve to watch his TV set and couldn't care less if he slept with Justine or not. Det. Hanna's step-daughter Lauren, Natelie Portman, is so upset over his and her moms bickering that she attempts to kill herself. Lauren does this by slashing her wrists and then trying to drown herself in her step-fathers apartments bathtub.McCauley also gets involved with this young graphic designer Eady, Amy Brenneman, but it's so out of character for him that it leads to his ultimate demise at the end of the movie. McCauley juggling between Eady's going along with him, to heaven knows where, in his attempted escape from being captured by the police at the L.A Airport and then going out of his way to murder Wangro, Kevin Gage, at the airport hotel that's crawling with L.A policemen. Wangro who was involved in the opening scene armor car robbery was later kicked out of McCauly's gang, and almost killed by him. Yet how did Wangro somehow seems to have gotten a hold of McCauley's later plans to rob a midtown L.A bank? it's never explained what and how Wangro knew about the impending bank robbery since he was totally out of the loop when it was planned and later executed! And what exactly had Wangro's later involvement with the Van Zant mob have to do with him informing on McCauley's plans to the police?There's also Jon Voight as this big mob honcho Nat who looks like General Custer at the Little Big Horn. Voight pops up every now and then in the movie, giving McCauley advice that's always on target, but who's part in the film is never really explained by the script writers. As well as not clarifying the story behind the Shiherlis' Chris & Charlene, Val Kilmer & Ashley Judd. The wacky couples zany and bizarre relationship soon threatens to screw up all of McCauley's plans for his last big score. Chris gets badly shot up in the L.A bank robbery and looks like he's about to die from his wounds but then what seems like only hours later he shows up, with a new haircut, totally recovered! Chris also comes up with a new identity that was so convincing that even Let. Hanna and the LAPD had to let him go free! This after he was involved in the deaths of at least a dozen innocent people and L.A policemen that afternoon!We earlier saw Charlene give Chris some kind of hand signal as the L.A police were about to pinch him, in a sting they set up for him. But all Chris did was turn around in his car and drive out of sight and like magic he was immune from prosecution?The movies ridicules ending was about as exciting as a game of chess. Both Let. Hanna and his rival and adversary in the movie Neil McCauley are seen running for what seemed like the length of the Boston Marathon all around L.A Airport and it's surroundings. This was all done I suspect so those of us, still awake and waiting to see the big showdown between the two, could finally switch the channel and get back to watching something that makes more sense and is far more interesting; like the Saturday Morning Cartoons.",5,13,29,9 March 2006
The Thin Red Line," I waited all my life for this!
","****SPOILERS*** 'Thin Red Line' ranks right up there with 'All Quite on the Western Front' and 'Paltoon' as one of the finest war or better anti-war movies ever made. It centers around the angelic looking as well as acting Pvt. Witt, Jim Cavlezel, who's given a chance to redeem himself after being AWOL a number of times form his unit by his good friend and company 1st Sgt. Edward Welsh, Sean Penn, who assigns him to a disciplinary unit as a non combat stretcher bearer. Sent to hit the beaches at Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands Witt soon realizes that he can help his fellow GI's, members of the 25th US Army infantry division, more in fighting alongside them then carrying their bodies, dead and wounded, back behind the battle line.Lead by Let. Col Gordon Tell, Nick Nolte, the troops are to relieve the exhausted battered and blooded US Marines in securing Henderson Field on the island that the Japs are determine to capture and hold on to. Let.Col Tell who's been passed up a number of times for general feels that this, the battle for Henderson Field, will finally get him the general's star that he sought for so long. Even if every man under his command end up getting killed and wounded in him getting it. The one problem that Let. Col Tell has on scudding his dreams of combat glory is one of his front-line officers Captain Staros, Elias Koteas, who's far more interested in the safety of the man under his command then any promotion he can get by getting them killed. Which is exactly what Let. Col Tell plans to do in having them take the vitally important hill 210 in a frontal assault not flanking movement, which will cost far less losses, that Captain Staros insists upon. The film has one of the longest sustained battle scenes, well over 30 minutes, of any war movie that I can think of that puts you right into the thick of the fighting between the GI's and their Japanese Marine opponents. Were shown in the give no quarters fighting how war dehumanized both sides with the what you would expect the good guys Army GI's almost as brutal and barbaric as the Japs in how they treat the surrendered and wounded Japanese soldiers in their custody. Not that the Japanese were any better towards the US Marines & GI's that they captured in the fighting either.***SPOILERS*** It's late in the movie that Pvt. Witt's Humanity comes to the surface in him voluntarily taking the lead or point on a dangerous mission deep behind the Japanese lines in order to, if and when the time comes, have the men with him survive at his own expense. It showed to everyone in his company including his good friend. 1st. Sgt Welsh just how courageous Pvt. Witt really was, in spite of his record of AWOL's, in him saving lives not taking them. There an actor in the movie who get's a Dear John letter from his girlfriend back home who for a while I thought was Joaquin Phoenix but, until I read the ending credits, isn't. the guy looked so much like Phoenix that he could have well been his long lost identical twin brother!",10,1,2,23 April 2013
The Birds," The Bird's the Word
","**SPOILERS*** The film 'The Birds' starts out like a 1930's screwball comedy with handsome and available criminal lawyer Mitch Brenner, Rod Taylor, getting under rich socialite as well as jet setting Melanie Daniels, Tippi Hedren, skin about how spoiled she is. That's when Mitch spots her at a local San Francisco pet store where he's looking to buy a pair of love birds for his 11 year old sister Cathy's, Veronica Cartwright, birthday. Annoyed and at the same time impressed by the handsome stranger Melanie find out where he lives and plans to buy him the birds herself as a present and at the same time give him a piece of her mind in the bargain. That's when the light comedy ends and the sheer horror begins in the movie.Traveling all the way up to Badoga Bay, to present him the love birds, where Mitch is spending the weekend with his mom Lydia, Jessica Tandy,and sister Cathy things start to happen in the little fishing town that there's no logical explanation for. The birds in the area, finches blackbirds ravens and seagulls, start to go on a rampage against the people living there! At first it's just one bird at a time being aggressive but as the days ware on they mass in the hundreds and thousands and attack anything in sight. Melinia getting a room from local teacher Annie Hayworth, Suzanne Pleshette, finds out that not only is she Cathy's teacher but had an affair with Mitch. There's also a side story in the film in that Annie's affair was broken up by Mitch's widowed mom Lydia in fearing that she's take him away from her and that also effects Mitch relations with Melanie as well. That all soon disappears when the birds come on the scene,by the tens of thousands,and start both terrorizing as well as killing the citizens in Badoga Bay!One of Alfred Hitchcock's biggest hits,it grossed well over 11 million dollars in the box office, with things in it that he's not really known for: The eye popping special effects scenes of the birds on the attack in the air as well as on the ground in the movie. There's that famous scene with Melanie sitting near a monkey bar outside the school where at first one black bird lands on it and then within minutes it swamped with hundreds more as an unsuspecting Melanie with her back turned is just enjoying the view! Not for once realizing that she's, and those in the school, are about to be viciously attacked by them! There's later in the movie the scene when Malanie is trapped in the attic of the Brenner house and attacked and almost pecked to death by hundreds of attacking birds that's even more terrifying and bloody, being shot in color, then the famous shower scene in 'Psycho'. In fact actress Tippi Hedren was so traumatized by it that she actually suffered a nervous breakdown and was sidelined for a week after living or acting through it!***SPOILERS*** With all the great scenes in the film it's the final one that really stuck with me. That's when the birds by now in the hundreds of thousands overrunning Bodaga Bay and now completely in control allow the few remaining residents to leave unharmed in a show, if you can call it that, of compassion. In what seems like the birds knowing that after what happened to them that they'll never come back there again and go tell those living outside of Bagoda Bay what to expect if they ever did!",8,3,5,26 June 2012
All the President's Men," I know we have enemies but I didn't know we were that popular
","Long but never boring film despite it's almost unlimited cast of characters about the infamous Watergate break-in and the cover-up that followed. A cover-up that lead to the resignation of the then President Richard M. Nixon and the conviction of dozens of his aids up to his former as well as acting, at the time, Attorney General and White House Chief of Staff.Based on the book 'All the President's Men' by the two Washington Post reporters who broke the story Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, Dustin Hoffman & Robert Redford,the film starts just three weeks before the Watergate break-in on June 1, 1972 when President Nixon came back home to Washington D.C after his triumphant state visit to Communist China. In a Presidential Election campaign that was his to lose with President Nixon well ahead in the polls, against his Democratic challenger George McGovern, he did everything to not just win, which was a forgone conclusion, the Presidential Election but to protect those, the Watergate burglar's, who in fact put his stay in the White House in jeopardy!What was referred to as a third rate burglary, by President Nixon and his supporters, metastasized into a cancerous growth on the presidency that destroyed not only Richard Nixon's career in politics but almost had him indited tried and convicted of possible crimes, which Nixon's successor in the White House Gerald Ford pardoned him of, against the US Constitution and Bill of Rights. The two documents that Nixon was sworn to uphold protect and defend when he was inaugurated, twice, as President of the United States of America.The film has both Woodward and Bernstein following up a number of leads that seemed to lead nowhere in who was behind the Watergate break-in. With their investigation hitting one brick wall after another in pops the mysterious and shadowy Deep Throats, Hal Holbrook, who tips off reporter Woodward to what's behind the break-in in a number of vital clues he cryptically hands him.This has both Woodward and Bernstein discover a secret slush fund run by non other then the former Attorney General in the Nixon Administration John Mitchell! Mitchell is now in charge of CREEP-The Committee to Reelect the President-and the secret slush fund is being used to destroy any of Nixon's Democratic opponents, Ed Kennedy Ed Muskie and George McGovern, who will end up running against him for the presidency. What's even worse is that Mitchell & Co are using slush fund money and their political clout to control the F.B.I C.I.A and Justice Department, in covering up the break-in, and thus undermining the US Constitution itself!As it eventually turned out it was Richard Nixon who did more to destroy his presidency then Woodward Bernstein and their boss at the Washington Post Ben Bradlee, Jason Robards, all put together. Instead of Nixon letting the Wateregate burglars twist in the wind and not having him stick his neck, by using his power as President,out in saving their a**es-until at least after the 1972 election- the investigation of the break-in and who was behind it would have ended right there and then. The Watergate break-in would have been dismissed by the news media, including the Washington Post, as the work of a few overzealous Nixon campaign workers and nothing more.P.S What's even more ironic as well as sad, for Richard Nixon, is that after the 1972 election that Richard Nixon was reelected by the biggest vote percentage, over 60%, in US Presidential Election History he could easily have gotten the Watergate burglars off legally by just pardoning them! Something Richard Nixon should have seriously thought about before breaking the law and not only having the burglars face, and later serve, long prison sentences but having himself put into the position of joining them behind bars as well!",8,2,2,17 October 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," A case of far too much overkill
","**SPOILERS** In what at first looked like a 'Death Wish' clone the movie 'A Law Abiding Citizan' turns the victim of a home invasion-where his both wife and daughter were brutally murdered-into a mad dog psycho killer. Not only that but as we soon see this victim of violence's murderous as well as sadistic actions are so gross and shocking that they suppress even those of the most crazed foreign as well as domestic terrorists that this nation has ever been confronted with!Clyde Shelton, Gerald Butler, the survivor of the home invasion at first lets justice run its course in the prosecution of the two thugs who murdered his family Clarence Darby, Christian Stolte, and Rupert Ames, Josh Stewart. It's when the actual killers of Clyde's wife and daughter-Clarence Darby-decided to turn evidence again his innocent, in not murdering the two, partner Ames that he's given a five year sentence with Ames getting the death penalty. This has Clyde blow a fuse and take out his anger and later vengeance not only on his and his families attackers and murderers but the US Jusitice Department as well! Feeling that the assistant Philadelphia D.A Nick Rice, Jamie Foxx, fell down on the job in letting Darby get get off with a light sentence Clyde spends the next ten years planning to not only murder both Darby as well as Ames, who's in fact to be executed, but Rice and his fellow members in the city's D.A and Police Departments!As we, and D.A Rice, soon find out Clyde is not only crazy but an electronic genius as well as master escape artist! Clyde uses those talents to not only murder, in the most gruesome ways possible, Darby but Ames as well. This when Ames was in the process of being put to death, via lethal injection, by the state! It wasn't enough that Ames was to be put to death but Clyde had to make sure that he suffers the worst kind of death by secretly switching the more or less merciful drugs that were to kill Ames, who had nothing to do with the murder of Cyde's wife & daughter, with a concoction that had him have his veins pop out and blood vessels burst to the point where most of those witnessing his execution had to run from the death chamber before they passed out from fright!By far Clyde's most deadly attacks were saved for those in the Philadelphia Justice System murdering some dozen assistant D.A 's judges and even Darby's lawyer in his war against those who helped get Darby off on a plea bargain! Not attempting to avoid arrest Clyde in fact got himself arrested in order to be put in the hole, solitary confinement, after murdering his cell-mate with a-I kid you not- leftover T-bone stake! It's from his jail cell that Clyde secretly conducted his one man war against the Philadelphia Justice Department with no one, in and out of the prison, having any idea how he was doing it!***SPOILER ALERT**** Clyde's bizarre as well as murderous actions didn't win anyone in the audience over to him. In fact you felt far more sympathetic towards the two thugs, Darby & Ames, who started Clyde on this murderous rampage then towards Clyde himself in his total disregard for human life which was far worse then what his family's killers did. When we finally find out just how this criminal mastermind-Clyde Shelton-was able to pull all these murders off, while behind bars, you realized that it wasn't that he was so smart but that those in the D.A's office, including D.A Nick Rice, as well as the police and prison administrators were so damn stupid! In them not being able to figure out, which should have been very obvious to them right from the start, just how Clyde was actually doing it! The film's mindless and confusing ending was the cherry on top of the cake for this turkey of a movie with Rice finally figuring out how Clyde was able to pull his evil plan off in part with him bing influenced by the writings of 19th Century German military genius and philosopher Von Clausewitz. Something that would have Von Clausewitz in him being even remotely connected to an insane and whacked person like Clyde turn, or better yet spin, in his grave!",5,2,5,25 November 2009
From Here to Eternity," This outfit they could give back to General Custer!
","***SPOILERS*** Very sanitized Hollywood version of the James Jones hard hitting novel about army life pre Pearl Harbor and the people, man and women, involved with it.Transferring into a tough infantry outfit former US Army bugler Robert E. Lee Prewitt, Montgomery Cliff, or 'Prew' as he's called is really in for it, the business, in his refusing to take part in the regimental boxing championship that's slated for December 15, 1941. Prew has become very mild mannered, instead of violent, after blinding his army buddy Dixie Wells in a sparring match and has given up using his fists in and out of the boxing ring! This has his company commander Capt. Dana Holmes, Philip Ober, have his men use a little persuasion to get Prew back in the ring by making his life miserable while he's there!While this is going on Prew's top sergeant Sgt. Milt Warden, Burt Lancaster, has been keeping an eye on Capt. Holmes' old lady, or wife, the sexy Karen Holmes, Deborah Kerr, who with her being on the outs with him, after she caught Captain Holmes with another woman, is looking for action and tries to find it with the many men stationed at the the Schofield Barracks US Army military base.Prew gets to find love at the local whorehouse in town, appropriately called the New Congress Club, with Lorene Burke, Donna Reed, whom he mistakes for a normal All-American working girl from the state of Oregon instead of a hooker! You would think that Prew was smart enough, in being an army man for five years, to be able to see the difference! Thrown into the mix is the outfit's #1 screw up Pvt. Angelo Maggio,that's Maggio without the 'D' in front, who knew Prew back at Fort Shafter where he was the company bugler. As the US moves towards war in the Pacific things get really spicy as well as dangerous for all the major characters in the film. Sgt.Warden and Karen have a hot and heavy love affair and Maggio in getting drunk and AWOL on guard duty ends up in the brig that's run by the sadistic Sgt. Fatso Judsdon, Ernest Borgnine, who's got it in for him big time! Prew meanwhile lose his ability to turn the other cheek when Captain Holmes has his boys push the poor guy to the brink and ends up wiping the floor with his #1 goon Sgt. Galovitch, John Dennis, who asked for and really got it from the former confirmed US Army pacifist. After getting his clock cleaned by the hard hitting Prew Sgt. Galovitch was busted down to private and put in charge, a fitting Job for the butt-kissing sergeant, of the company latrine. As for Galovitch's boss Captain Holmes he got canned out of the US Army for conduct unbecoming an officer or even enlisted man!***SPOILERS*** What really saves the movie is the Japanese sneak attack on Peral Harbor since up until then, with the exception of the Sgt. Warden & Karen Holmes sizzling surf side love scene, it was really going nowhere and nowhere fast. We had a few knife fights and a person beaten to death, off camera, as well as Prew getting his act together but by then, with the US at war, it didn't help him that much by him refusing an order for him to advance and be recognized! As for the women in the film Karen & Lorene they checked out of Hawaii never to return again in all the hurt and suffering they went through in them both being there.P.S Check out George 'Superman' Reeves as US Army Sgt. Maylon Stark as one of Karens lovers back in the states, Fort Bliss Texas, who fills in a very much in love with her as well as very naive Sgt.Warden in just what he's in for by fooling around with the man hungry and sex starved Karen Holmes!",8,0,1,9 May 2011
V for Vendetta," This world that I am a part of that I helped shaped will come to an end tonight with me
","****SPOILERS**** Futuristic drama set in 2020 Great Britian about a totalitarian government being confronted by a dark clothed freedom fighter determined to bring it down that it ends up costing him his life. Planing to make himself and intentions known to the British people on midnight November 5, V, Hugo Weaving, first rescues young British national TV employee Evey, Natalie Portman, from two government security men who are about to have her arrested for being outside on the street after curfew.V takes Evey with him onto a London rooftop as the Old Baily Building in London is blown to pieces by explosives that he planted there to the music of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. That results in the British dictator Chancellor Adam Sutler,John Hurt, having a fit ordering his entire army of security, as well as the British military, to find who ever did it and then bring him to justice; Which is a kangaroo trial conducted by the state without a jury.The next day V breaks into the government controlled TV studio in London and after dispatching a squad of security men goes on the air telling the Britsh people that he'll be at war with Sutler's regime with the final reckoning coming next November 5 'Guy Fawkes Day'. It's then when he'll destroy the British Parliament Building that Fawkes attempted, but failed, to do back in 1605.The movie 'V for Vendetta' mirrors what's happening now in the world with terrorism as the weapon of choice by the likes of Osama Bin-Ladin & Co. and has V using these same hit-and-run tactics against the British Government that he feels has betrayed and enslaved the British people. Enormously successful in his battle against the Sutler regime V nevertheless is a one man army with no one, but Evey, joining him in his fight. Which makes him a bit more then just a human being but someone with superhuman powers who can take on dozens of opponents and defeat them without as much as breaking into a sweat.We get to know V's background in a number of flashbacks that indicate that he was the subject of a government experiment that went wrong that left him scared for life. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and Zorro-like hat V strikes us as someone out of the 18th not 21th century. We also get some idea of how a totalitarian regime like Adam Sutler's took over the government with flashbacks about a deadly biological attack on Britian that resulted in over 100,000 deaths. Were also given the impression that it was the Sutler Regime itself that engineered that attack, making it look like it was the work of Islamic terrorists, in order to get the British people through their representatives in the Parliament to give up their rights and make Sutler a total dictator who answers to no one and to no laws.As November 5 gets closer by the day It's not V but Chancellor Sutler and his underlings who start to panic as the mysterious masked maestro knocks off key members of his regime including the 'Voice of London' Lewis Profhero,Roger Allen,who we later find out was the commandant of a brutal government concentration camp where V was later almost killed in a chemical explosion. Using the London tube, or subway, V has a plan to use a train-load of explosives that will go under the Parliament Building at precisely midnight November 5 and blow the place straight to hell but Sutler won't be there. He's deposed by his handlers lead by the secretive behind the scenes Cheedy, Tim Pigoff-Smith, who together with his henchmen ends up confronting V in a battle that the result will be the future course of Britsh, as well as American and world, history.Thought-provoking film with a really surprise ending, that takes up the movies last fifteen or so minutes, that has you thinking about that famous saying about Freedom & Equality; 'Freedom is not Free and all men are not Equal'. That so perfectly describes the movies sheep-like and ignorant British people in the quotes beginning statement and the courageous and principled masked avenger and freedom fighter V for Vendetta in the quotes end.",8,8,15,1 April 2006
