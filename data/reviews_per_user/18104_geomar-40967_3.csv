Black Swan," Perfect movie, perfect performance, perfect music.
","I get goosebumps just thinking about this movie. It's incredible well-made and one of the best movies I have ever seen . Natalie Portman was just stunning....she deserves every inch of that Oscar. FEAR, ART, BEAUTY & one of the most powerful endings in the history of cinema!",10,1,1,1 January 2019
