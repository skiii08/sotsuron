Requiem for a Dream," This film is horrible, it's fantastic.
","Requiem for a Dream depicts a story of a retired mother, Sara Goldfarb, living in an apartment all by herself - only having her neighborly friends living near. Her son, Harry, is a drug dealer and an addict, along with his pal Tyrone, and his girlfriend Marion, whom wished that she could be a fashion designer.Sara spends most of her time watching her favourite reality show on TV. One day, she gets selected to appear on that show. She wishes to go on with her special red dress but cannot fit in it due to her weight. She goes on a diet but doesn't seem to all work that well. Her next choice is diet pills, which wasn't a very good idea. Sara starts taking them irregularly and develops an addiction.Harry, Tyrone and Marion on the other hand, struggle to keep up in the drug business and begin losing money and drugs.As the film progresses, we see all of this get worse as their addictions spiral out of control.Requiem for a Dream is really sickening and it breaks all expectations. It is absolutely fantastic but not one of those films you would feel comfortable watching twice (although I have watched it more than twice). Every actor in this film play their roles brilliantly, especially Ellen Burstyn. It's incredibly gut- wrenching. The directing and writing by Darren Aronofsky is phenomenal. It's so well written it blows my mind. I easily give this movie a 10/10.",10,0,1,10 January 2017
