Saturday Night Fever," Still surprisingly relevant and engrossing despite it's trappings.
","Few films can claim the status of creating a national (international, even) phenomenon upon release, but this one can. It offers a glimpse into the restless, nowhere lives of a group of young Brooklyn men, particularly Travolta, an hourly employee in a paint store who burns off steam on the dance floor every weekend. At home, he's considered worthless, but in his favorite dance club, he is monarch of all he surveys with men admiring him and women throwing themselves at him (even offering to dab his sweaty brow!) All important to him is an upcoming dance contest which he feels will propel him into another level of notoriety and prestige and he sets out to win it any way he can, constantly practicing his slickest moves. Gorney plays a social-climbing girl who has laid the ground work for getting out of Brooklyn and, though she is attracted to Travolta, is repulsed by the common qualities he represents. He becomes fascinated by her and considers her his way out of his current surroundings. Meanwhile, Travolta's friends dabble in booze, drugs, sex and gang warfare as they wallow in the stew of their existence. It all builds up to the big night of the contest where things may not turn out as expected. Travolta is magnetic in this, his first major film role. He worked tirelessly to perfect the dance moves which (though, at times, look rather silly today) are a highlight of the film. He also, however, brings much heart, charisma and commitment to the dramatic side of his not-always-sympathetic character. Gorney (who is easily a decade too old for her role) is a good counterpoint to Travolta and ably embodies her tacky, but desperate-to-change, character. She attempts to be as classy and refined as possible, yet her accent and crackling chewing gum belies her past. Their somewhat complex relationship adds some depth to what could have been a very shallow film. Travolta's friends are played with much authenticity and verve. Oddly, these actors continued with only marginally successful careers while Travolta went through the stratosphere. Another carefully etched performance is turned in by Pescow as one of Travolta's devoted followers. She goes a tad overboard near the end, but otherwise presents a solid, though pitiful, characterization. (She was one of the few actors in the film to achieve any sort of success afterwards and even that was limited. Gorney fell off the cinematic map entirely!) Travolta's family is played by more believable and well-textured actors. The music of the film (the soundtrack of which was one of the all time top sellers) is inherent to the story and is a compilation of some of the best that disco had to offer (though some might say even the best was still horrible!) Even the 'Disco Sucks' crowd cannot deny the impact that this film had on the country as it set trends everywhere. Interestingly, some of the group numbers in the disco bear a striking similarity to the more recent country line dancing craze, only with more arm movements. The language of the film is tough, but necessary and realistic. There are two gut-wrenchingly suspenseful scenes atop the Verrazano Narrows bridge. It's a time capsule of a hedonistic and free-wheeling era (pre-AIDS) but with insightful examination of class structure and economic barriers, the nature of friendship among young men and the cost of inhumanity towards one another. A rancid and ludicrous sequel (which is good for some unintentional laughs) can not tarnish the spirit of the original film which still holds up today.",Null,11,12,3 May 2005
The Sound of Music," The perfect film musical......
","This film is a triumph in all departments. Every aspect, from the cinematography to the acting, the sets to the costumes, the music, choreography, script, is top notch. While the film is family friendly and has a sweet story, it is constantly amazing the way people attack it as saccharine and sugary. This can certainly be said of the stage show, but the movie version has been carefully produced to provide a more well-rounded vision. Ernest Lehman worked wonders with the underdeveloped and unremarkable dialogue of the play. He inserted so many moments of wit, humor, romance and poignancy that are nowhere in sight in the original. the art directors purposefully chose muted settings and colors. Each of the actors bent over backwards to provide a brilliant performance. Andrews is already down in history for the performance of a lifetime (and a voice to match), but Plummer is not to be forgotten. Not only is he regal and handsome, but his decision to play the Captain as a complex, sophisticated man with a sly dose of sarcasm was wonderful. His steely, stern persona is eventually melted down by the irrepressible Andrews to great effect. Every supporting performance is also delivered with the right amount of appeal, humor or menace as called for in the script. However, the one that takes the cake....that amazes each time, is the slinky, catty, toweringly glamorous Parker as Baroness Schraeder. Wisely, her songs were cut, further separating her from all the glee around her, so that she could whip out such zingers as 'Why didn't you tell me....to bring along my harmonica?' or when she's told that Andrews may not make a great nun, 'If you need anything, I'd be happy to help you.' The character is given a much more polished and integral position in the film versus the stage and virtually every line of her dialogue (unlike in the play) is a howler. Though Wood was lovely in her role as the Mother Abbess, it was Parker who should have gotten an Oscar nod....and WON! Every expression, every syllable, every glance belies the decades of experience Parker gained as a leading lady during the 40's and 50's. Her clothes by Dorothy Jeakins are awe-inspiring. This type of film-making is GONE. The location photography, the simplicity of story and design, the sheer good-spiritedness of it all...they just can't do this anymore. Thankfully, there's this flawless gem to turn to when one just want to feel good. But saccharine? No..... Compare this to other beloved musicals with their garish colors and sugary story lines ('Seven Brides...', 'Singin' in the Rain', '...Molly Brown', 'The Music Man', to name just a few...) They are all highly enjoyable, but are hardly less sweet than this! Just one word.....Nazis!! Though virtually everyone knows the outcome, there is still genuine suspense at the climax of 'The Sound of Music'. The film has it all.",Null,168,253,29 April 2002
Minority Report," A minority of sense and originality.
","This derivative, clichÃ©d and by-the-numbers film is one of Spielberg's worst and does Cruise no favors either. It's a messy, trite conglomeration of other films like 'Logan's Run', 'Total Recall' and 'Twelve Monkeys' all spiced up with flashy camera work and expensive effects. The film gets off to a ripsnorting and arresting start and then goes completely down hill from there. An interesting premise is gobbled up by terrible scripting and self-congratulating visual ideas. Cruise is unintentionally hilarious when he's flicking and flinging his hands around at the viewscreen. That was a terrible, campy touch that will no doubt delight young boys in the audience as it so supposedly 'cool'. There is zero.......ZERO suspense about who the villain will be.....none. Cruise is so-so. His character is often rather stupid, but he does manage to infuse some feeling into the part. Almost every member of the supporting cast overacts and hams it up to the point of hilarity or annoyance or both. The prison monitor is the worst, but others are nearly as bad. Smith, a fine actress, tries to inject irony and class to her role, but it's hopeless. The most annoying thing about this film which is jam-packed with annoyances is the fact that all the men chew gum incessantly. It's obnoxious and distracting. Farrell is really the only one who comes out of it unscathed and Morton is also very intense in a difficult role. She does a good job, but is not exactly a treat to watch. Cruise's wife is an okay actress, but doesn't pair well with him at all. One of the set pieces, an 'invasion' of a tenement house by mechanical 'spiders' has some interest and tension, but is partially spoiled by all the ham acting of the extras and the over the top situations. One is on the toilet, two are screwing, two are violently arguing......doesn't anyone watch TV in their apartment or just cook or read??? Everything was overdone and unrealistic. A few clever moments and some gripping visuals, but a lousy script, bad direction and campy performances sink it.",Null,0,0,12 September 2002
Star Trek," Frenetic, brainless bastardization of the original concept.
","It happens on daytime television: A new storyline is developed which renders everything that came before it impossible and inconsistent. It happens in comic books: Entire histories and established conceits of a character or situation are redone without regard for the previous effort. Here it happens in a movie. A revisionist, souped-up, tweaked version of the famous television series comes along that jettisons about 80% of what made the original meaningful, resonant and special. Not only does it reconfigure or ignore the 'established' continuity of the characters' prior universe, but it's also unapologetic about it. Who cares what anyone else thought when they watched 'Star Trek' during its original run or in syndication? This is the way it's going to be for the A.D.D., Xbox, Jonas Brothers, youtube, Hannah Montana, iPod, CGI set and anyone who doesn't like it can be damned. Since the makers of this and other products, which undercut any personal investment a viewer may have made in the previous work, have no regard for that audience, the only recourse that audience has is to resist supporting the new work. However, that hardly matters when something comes along that, despite its emptiness, idiocy and even ignorance, appeals so much to the target audience that it can't help but be a huge success. All that's left to do is either chuck one's emotional connection to the original concept and get on board or sit at home with the 4 decade old series on DVD. Though not every fan of the original series will be this polarized, it's a decision that many folks will have to make. The good news is that Pine is an appealing, dynamic and enthusiastic Kirk (though not much like William Shatner, for better or for worse), Quinto is close to perfection as Spock in both looks and manner and the chemistry between the core cast members is adequate enough to provide a decent sense of camaraderie in the inevitable follow-up, especially if, on the off chance, the producers decide to actually follow the intended path and put the team into the scenario of seeking out 'new life and new civilizations' together instead of rehashing and retreading everything that was already 'established.' Cross and Ryder also prove to be effective choices as Quinto's parents. Also, Bana's ship is decidedly imposing and threatening looking. The bad news is that virtually any semblance of the vision, social commentary, optimism, discovery, sense of unity or even a sense of adventure, really, is absent from this incarnation. In its place are lightning fast camera-work and editing, animated effects, over-the-top 'stunts' and lots of explosions and death. The people are props and/or caricatures and are, in fact, incidental to the action 'showpieces.' With luck, the next installment will capitalize on the premise of the Enterprise's mission and allow the ensemble to gel into a unit that sticks together as they explore the farthest reaches of the galaxy. This messy, inane, disrespectful prologue doesn't inspire much faith, however. Oh, and check out the female Vulcan council-member's beaming expression of pride and joy when Spock is admitted to their academy! Did anyone associated with this film ever see even one episode of the series?",Null,38,56,20 May 2009
Memento," Unique, deftly-handled thriller which almost wears out its welcome.
","In this puzzle box of an action mystery, Pearce plays a haunted, driven man with no idea how to proceed from the start of each day. It seems he has a short-term memory disorder, meaning he has to leave himself notes, Polaroids and other reminders just to figure out what it is he's doing. Chief among these reminders is a series of tattoos he's had made all over his body which display certain facts he needs to recall in order to figure out who it is who has killed his wife! The film, told in backwards fashion, interspersed with black and white, chronological, current footage of a phone conversation, depicts Pearce's struggle to remind himself of his mission and fulfill it while traveling backwards in order to let the audience find out what happened at the same time he does. Pearce is solid and arresting in the central role. An attempt seems to have been made to gear his appearance to that which resembles Brad Pitt for no apparent reason. Nonetheless, he creates a character compelling enough to warrant taking the journey through his damaged psyche. Other key players include Moss, as a battered cocktail waitress who becomes close to him and Pantoliano, a shifty pal who may not be everything he seems to be on the surface. Despite the unusual structure, which distorts time and sequence, the film is surprisingly easy to follow, though it obviously requires a certain amount of attention. Unfortunately, instead of building to a shattering climax, it begins to become somewhat tiresome and bothersome as it goes along, though the ending retains a certain degree of surprise and the craftsmanship of the film is strong. Perhaps the concept is a bit cumbersome in a feature length film and this idea would have worked better in a one-hour dramatic series or something similar. Still, it's got a significant number of fans and should appeal to those who like a challenge when watching movies versus being spoon fed the standard action fare.",Null,1,4,11 April 2008
12 Angry Men," 12 Excellent Performances
","Fonda tried his only attempt at producing with this tense, claustrophobic drama.  Though the film was initially not very successful and Fonda did not recoup enough money to draw a salary for it, it was a work close to his heart and has since gained an almost legendary status (only slightly dimmed by the endless mediocre stage versions that pop up everywhere from high schools to church basements.)  The story concerns the deliberation of twelve jury members in the case of a Puerto Rican youth accused of knifing his father to death.  Fonda picked each of the other jurors from among the best actors that New York City and Hollywood had to offer.  Some went on to greater fame.  A few are virtually unknown today, but all do a fine job in the film.  As the film gets under way, the jurors take a vote which tallies 11 guilty and 1 not guilty (Fonda.)  He must attempt to sway the remaining jurors to his viewpoint or risk a hung jury.  Each of the jurors fits a certain 'type'.  Some are meek, some loud, some wealthy, some poor, some ethnic, etc...  Scoring especially well (though their high volume bombast can be rough on the ears at times) are Cobb, Begley and Warden.  However, the quieter ones are no less effective.  Marshall is excellent as a carefully behaved upper crust man.  Webber is at his most handsome as a snappy ad exec.  Fonda underplays his role, allowing the audience to project its feelings onto his familiar face.  There is a lot of the expected discussion and rehashing of the evidence, but the film is also punctuated with a few piercing dramatic moments and somehow manages to create and build suspense in a story where there isn't a lot of doubt as to the outcome.  The film captures a sort of old world class and respect and dignity (even with the underbelly of life that gets exposed in the story) that is mostly absent from today's movies and today's world.  Whenever a man gets agitated, someone politely suggests that he calms down and typically, he does.  Today there would have to be a fistfight and all sorts of extra melodrama to keep audiences watching.  However, for the patient and appreciative viewer, this film satisfies greatly.  An interesting point is made at the end....that after all the deliberation and drama, the jurors never even knew each others' names and from here on will likely never see one another again. It's a thought-provoking and intriguing story with lots to offer.  Should be required viewing for anyone about to sit on jury duty as it illustrates the dangers of preconception and going with the flow.",Null,0,1,9 January 2003
The Notebook," Attractive, enjoyable, but unsurprising, love story.
","A surprise hit in this day of high-adrenaline adventure, lewd comedy and seedy crime films, this unabashedly romantic, yet startlingly conventional, romance has amassed a sizable following. Garner plays an elderly man who visits a elderly woman (Rowlands) suffering from dementia. Part of his therapy for her is to read from a notebook which tells the story of a pair of kids in the 1940's who find love and suffer separation, in part due to their different social backgrounds. Gosling is a poor, but nice, boy who dreams of restoring an old local mansion. McAdams is a wealthy, at times petulant, reasonably-cultured girl who has her future as a college student mapped out for her. When they meet up and fall for each other, her stern parents make sure to nip the romance in the bud, eventually causing her to fall for Marsden. Garner reads this story to Rowlands as the love affair is shown in flashback until finally, it seems as if Rowlands may know the participants of the story and begin to remember the situation. The film is lovingly crafted and beautifully shot. Garner is excellent and Rowlands is solid as well, even if she looks like no other dementia patient on God's planet, immaculately dressed, coiffed and made-up as she is and living in a fairy tale nursing home. Gosling is an appealing presence and McAdams gives a breathless and fresh performance. Neither of them go very far in suggesting the time period in which their characters live and they turn in very contemporary-tinged portrayals. (Some extra hot loves scenes were trimmed somewhat for the release print to at least preserve some small amount of decorum in the flashback story.) Excellent support comes from Allen, as McAdams' tightly-wound mother. Thornton, as her father, is a jarring caricature who does everything but twirl his moustache. Shepard plays Gosling's simple, but caring, father adeptly. Marsdon is attractive and likable in a fairly thankless part. Garner's children are portrayed by three of the least charismatic and compelling actors imaginable. Their very brief scene wounds the film, though not fatally. There are many romantic, funny and swooning moments as it attempts to display the great love between the youngsters. At times, this comes off as a dry-docked 'Titanic' - minus the disaster, especially when Gosling sits down to dinner with the ritzy set. The chief issue with the film is that it seems bent on protecting a big secret (which couldn't be more obvious!) while the audience tries to wonder whether some other surprise will come about, since the 'big reveal' becomes clear long before the alleged revelatory moment. Any bit of mystery or dramatic suspense is dissipated as what was painfully obvious is uncovered to be just what it seemed like. Still, lovers of love stories will be satisfied, even as the overlong film limps along to an even less rewarding climax. Romantics will appreciate the bond between the lovers while cynics will wonder what the point of the film even was.... Based on a wildly successful novel and directed by the son of Rowlands and experimental director John Cassavetes.",Null,0,1,21 December 2006
The Other Boleyn Girl," How to get a-head during the Tudor reign.
","One of British history's most captivating female figures is examined in this fictionalized account, which sticks to some undisputed historical facts while weaving a story in between the cracks (and often tweaking the facts in the process as well.) Portman plays a young commoner from a family with designs on raising its station in the world. They attempt to place her in the arms of King Henry VIII (Bana), but she winds up being overshadowed by her younger, more demure sister Johansson. Bana moves Johansson into the palace (despite his marriage to Torrent), setting off a rivalry between Johansson and Portman that will forever change the face of England. Portman, after a brief exile in France, returns to claim Bana for herself and provide him with a male heir to the throne. However, that may not be as easy as she thinks it is. Portman gives an able portrayal of this complex character, though the script sometimes muddles her motivations. Her demeanor generally suits the time period. Johansson is often equally at home in the period and gives a nuanced and sincere performance. Little is known of her real-life counterpart and, thus, she is able to graft characteristics and qualities onto her without getting historical aficionados too far up in arms. Bana looks fetching in his many elaborate costumes and hats and is manly enough to carry them off, though he in almost no way resembles the legendary king. He is more of a supporting presence here and the script, as in the case of Portman, but even more so, doesn't allow him to display much, if any, reason for some of his actions. All three actors try hard and are superficially successful, but a more incisive script would have gone a long way in presenting a more resonant story. Morrissey is effective, if a bit one note in his role as the girls' relentlessly social-climbing uncle. Rylance, as their father, is appropriately weak and conflicted while Scott Thomas, as their mother, radiates knowing sensibility in every drop of her scant dialogue. Sturgess is appealing as the girls' sensitive and caring brother. Torrent manages to command the screen in her few scenes as the first wife who has been dealt a cruel hand of infertility and children who have died in infancy. It's all a very fascinating subject for a film and it's astonishing to think of the way kings could maneuver people at their will, regardless of the circumstances, and then, when up against a brick wall, change the rules altogether! The way women were treated and yet how they sometimes managed to work it to their advantage is an equally compelling topic. The (strangely claustrophobic) film is handsome and attractive to the eye and is mostly interesting, but suffers from a few issues. The script, as previously mentioned, just doesn't afford ample reasons and/or insight into what makes most of these people behave the way they do. Also, the film's pace is askew. The beginning is leisurely and deliberate, but the final third is practically break-neck, with things happening swiftly and with very little explanation for them or dwelling on them. That said, the film remains an arresting, if soapy, historical drama with charismatic acting, lovely music and beautifully appointed sets and clothing. History buffs and fans of the novel (which has only partly been adapted faithfully here) will give the film further demerits.",Null,2,4,5 March 2008
Elizabeth," She ruled as Elizabeth the First, yet somehow Cate came in second (or worse) at Oscar time!
","Things get off to quite a vicious and visceral start in this flavorful take on the early life of Queen Elizabeth I as three protestants are roughly shorn and then burned at the stake. It's a fairly unforgettable sequence that grabs the attention and, for the most part, the film continues to do so from then on, though nothing quite tops the opening for sheer savagery. Blanchett portrays the title future monarch who is in exile due to her claim to the British throne, currently occupied by her older half-sister Burke. When her time comes to ascend, she is faced with powerful enemies such as Eccleston and powerful allies such as Rush while the royal court is in a constant state of hubbub over her and her political decisions. One pressure she is under involves marrying and producing an heir, something she would like to do with her childhood love Fiennes, but which she can't due to his status. French nobleman Cassel is offered to her as an option, but proves unacceptable as well. Meanwhile, she is battling Scotland, which is under the rule of Ardant, yet another enemy. Blanchett manages to juggle the affairs of state and the affairs of the heart while assassins wait around every other corner. As most viewers know, she manages to succeed in most areas and proceeds to a long and mostly illustrious reign. Blanchett is striking and exceptional in this, one of her early film roles. She balances a whole range of emotions for a legendary personage without ever heading over the top. Rush lends perfect support. The two had worked together before in theatre and enjoyed a built-in rapport. Eccleston is appropriately exasperated and vengeful while Fiennes is endearingly loving and protective. Attenborough, frequently a hammy actor, displays some of that quality here, but not fatally so. Ardant, Cassel and Burke provide the right amount of zest in their scenes. Gielgud appears very briefly as an outraged Pope and Craig has an early role as one his brutal henchmen. The story plays fast and loose with some historical facts, though its visual attributes cannot be denied, nor can the star-making performance of its leading actress. In an ironic twist, both Rush and Fiennes starred in another 1998 film that had appearances from Elizabeth I (played by Dame Judi Dench)  'Shakespeare in Love'. The leading lady of that film, Gwyneth Paltrow, was given the Oscar over Blanchett in a preposterous move by the Academy (thus also missing the chance to reward two actresses in two different films who were playing the same person as Dench won for Best Supporting Actress that year.) It's a vivid, captivating take on a fascinating subject though it isn't always easy for non-historians to figure out exactly what is taking place at any given moment. Fortunately, the strong performances and stylish direction keep the momentum going and some title cards at the beginning help set the stage for what comes after. Almost a decade later, Blanchett returned to the role for a sequel that details the events occurring in Elizabeth's reign after this film.",Null,1,1,31 January 2008
Alexander," Alexander the Grating
","An obvious labor of love for director Stone, who had this project in mind for years and years before it was completed, it is nonetheless a flawed and only moderately entertaining film. At 175 minutes, but without a clear focus and lacking compelling characters, it's more an endurance test than a pleasing movie-going experience. A wildly miscast Farrell plays the legendary leader of Macedonia who strove to conquer most of the known world in the mid 300's BC. Pushed onward by a driven, passionate mother (Jolie) and at odds with his tough, war-mongering father (Kilmer), he trudges through every known land he can reach, crushing the rulers and either adopting the populaces or selling them into slavery, all in the name of creating a world kingdom. Meanwhile, he attempts to create an heir with his wives, the most notable one being Dawson, while carrying on a life-long love relationship with his right-hand man Leto. Farrell, who was hired on the cheap before his star-power was high enough to prevent it, is all wrong for the part. He tries valiantly to inject feeling and passion into the role, but it's such a poorly drawn character and he's so physically wrong for it that he is defeated more often than he succeeds with it. Some people just shouldn't be blonde, at least not in the succession of ghastly wigs, ranging from Shirley Jones-esquire numbers to Billy Ray Cyrus mullets, he is given here. His thick Irish accent is also far out of place. No matter what they say about it being deliberate, there is no way that Kilmer, with his flat American accent, and Jolie, who speaks as if she's Miss Transylvania, could produce and raise a child with that accent. Cosmetics and accents aside, Farrell just isn't heroic enough or inspiring enough to take on this type of role. Jolie, swathed in snakes during most every appearance, looks great, but goes way over the top, becoming something out of a dark fairy tale rather than a historical figure. Kilmer is surprisingly acceptable. His ham acting suits the bravado and position of his ruddy character. Leto, in almost all of his scenes, looks lost, opening his mouth and darting his eyes as if he'd like to say something, but doesn't know what. The only exceptions are a pair of scenes between him and Farrell in which some real emotion is dredged up. Dawson has a topless wedding night scene which is destined to go down in the annals of camp history forever. A tiresome, difficult to understand Hopkins plays Ptolemy in a snore-inducing prologue and epilogue (along with bits in between) that never should have seen the light of day. The soldiers are played by a variety of solid performers, some of whom, like Rhys-Meyers, are thoroughly wasted. Veterans Blessed and Plummer also have just brief cameo roles. Many of the lines of the script, as well as character names, are swallowed by the actors as they either sink into their characters or fight to be heard over the clanking swords or other background noises. The film was difficult to make and features several stunning sets and costumes. However, like virtually all other epic films these days, it's loaded down with CGI, rendering most of its vistas and hordes of soldiers unbelievable. (For a glimpse of a major military battle with REAL people assembled for it, take a look at 1970's 'Waterloo'.) In one scene Farrell gives an endless, rambling, inspirational speech to his men, of whom maybe a hundred or so can actually hear him, though he has 40,000 troops! While Stone is to be credited for not shying away from the bisexual aspects of the story, he tiptoes around it so uncomfortably and leaves it so unexamined that when it appears it actually comes off as gratuitous instead of organic to the material. The 1956 version of 'Alexander the Great' may have fallen short in many areas, but this is a massive, bloated, misguided debacle that will eventually be snickered at the same way some folks look back upon other sword & sandal campfests. Unable to accept defeat himself, Stone has recut the film TWICE to date, but there is no way to fix a film in which the lead (along with others) is miscast.",Null,4,6,8 February 2007
The Others," Moody, intriguing Gothic thriller
","Kidman gave the second half of her one-two punch of 2001 (the other being 'Moulin Rouge', of course) in this Gothic thriller. She stars as a wan, highly detailed and regimented mistress of a huge, virtually abandoned mansion on the island of Jersey in 1945. Her husband has gone to war and has not been heard from. She and her two young children are joined by a trio of servants just as strange sounds and occurrences begin to happen in the house. The children suffer from a rare (and real) disease that causes them to be sheltered at all times from harsh light. Before long, it becomes clear that something mystifying and disturbing is happening in the house. The film hinges on several things...the vision of its director (who wrote, directed and composed the music!), the atmospheric cinematography/sets and Kidman's striking performance. Clad in well-tailored dresses and with a Grace Kelly-esque hair-do (he character's name is even Grace), she makes a stunning figure in the claustrophobic and sometimes creepy surroundings. She does a magnificent job in the role (though to nitpick, her accent doesn't always stay in line with the character) and the audience is along for the ride almost immediately. She is matched by a terrific Flanagan as a wise, yet enigmatic servant. The children are also very solid and expressive. Eccleston makes a brief appearance, looking something like a more ravaged Ralph Fiennes if he'd starred in 'The English Mental Patient'. There are a few times in which the pace might seem that it could use a shove, but the overall texture and feel of the film is based on a deliberate mood which is set by this pace. Some people may be able to see one or more of the twists coming, but regardless, it is fun and suspenseful getting to them.",Null,0,0,9 June 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Entertaining, large-scale adventure film with simplistic motives.
","Director Emmerich seems to have a penchant for demolishing U.S. cities and landmarks! In 'Independence Day', the White House, among other places, was destroyed. In 'Godzilla', New York City took a beating. Now, Los Angeles, New York City and many points in between (and a few token areas around the rest of the globe) are devastated for the audience's pleasure. Quaid plays a climatologist who attempts to convince the leaders of the world that global warming is coming, probably within fifty to a hundred years. It turns out he was a bit off in his calculations and that the planet is actually going to endure another Ice Age in less than a week! This means that his son Gyllenhaal, who is in NYC for a school trip, is right in the path of a massive snowstorm that crystallizes everything in its way. It also means that his estranged wife Ward will have to sit in an empty hospital, dewily reading to a young cancer patient who can't be moved in anything but an ambulance (apparently freezing to death instantaneously is better than trying to transport a sick boy in a car?) Meanwhile, tornadoes, hailstorms and tidal waves are decimating territories all over the place as the U.S. Government (headed by President King and Vice-President Welsh) waffles on how best to handle the situation. When a tsunami, which is later frozen solid, traps Gyllenhaal and a few of his pals in the NYC public library, Quaid decides to trek from Pennsylvania to Manhattan, mostly on foot (!), to rescue him. In a film like this, it's all about the special effects. Fans of CGI will be in hog heaven as the over-the-top visuals dominate the lion's share of the film, starting with a showy opening sequence that features not one crumb of actual terrain. Again and again, highly-detailed computer imagery floods the screen with overwhelming images of natural disaster and destruction that, while breathtaking at times, never for a moment seem real, but more often look like scenes from a very expensive video game. Alas, this is the Hollywood of today. Nonetheless, given that this is the current method of action cinematography, the effects are top of the line. As in 'Independence Day', there are a ton of characters that are hastily sketched in prior to dying. A handful of actors get to flesh out their roles a bit further, or at least have the charisma to let the audience think they have. Quaid does a solid job. Gyllenhaal and his sweetheart Rossum are appealing (she, however, needs to get out of this genre after 'Poseidon' lest she becomes the Veronica Hamel of the early 2000's.) Mihok is exceedingly likable as one of Quaid's cohorts and Sanders is strong as another one. Ward does as much as she can with such a thankless, inert role. Holm is probably the most prestigious member of the cast and adds dramatic weight to his smallish role. It's nice to see King (albeit briefly) being used in a major film. The film's eco-message is presented with a sledgehammer. Welsh is blamed for not listening to Quaid's predictions, yet the predictions were given only days before the disaster and without the urgency that was truly needed due to the off-kilter timeline, so what was Welsh expected to do? The film's barely veiled agenda is to blame Republicans for the destruction of the modern world and, unfortunately, nothing is ever that simple. However, taken purely as a popcorn disaster flick, the movie delivers rather well. There's a lot going on, some of it very arresting, and the climax is actually surprisingly moving and hopeful, despite the complete and utter implausibility of virtually everything shown on screen. This is best enjoyed as a mindless adventure/disaster movie while ignoring the ludicrous science and politics of it.",Null,0,0,23 August 2006
A Bridge Too Far," A movie too long, but, at times, an impressive one.
","The 60s and 70s yielded quite a few all-star WWII epics and this is one of the better ones. The list of names is a very impressive one, especially when one considers the year in which this was made. The film concerns the disastrous British operation Market Garden, in which troops were to be parachuted into various locales near key bridges and then supported by ground forces to arrive shortly thereafter. Unfortunately, thanks to weather conditions, a few surprises from the enemy and other unwise decisions, the operation was not wholly successful and many lives were lost. A large collection of major actors appear in various parts based on real life participants, frequently using the actual names of the men. It's a long, detailed account of the mission, perhaps a little too involved and chock full for its own good at times, but there are memorable vignettes throughout. Hopkins plays a Lieutenant Colonel trapped with his men in a house that is eventually almost leveled by shellfire. The destruction of the town he's trying to liberate is very vividly depicted. Caan has one of the most unforgettable scenes as a Staff Sergeant determined to keep a promise to Campbell, one of his men. Some of the casting is questionable and will satisfy or disappoint according to taste. Gould, for example, is not believable at all in his role as a Colonel and Redford, though his sequence is decent, comes off as rather ridiculous in his raft-rowing moments. Hackman's entrance into the film is clever and is deftly handled by director Attenborough, but his accent is almost distractingly bad. Bogarde is good as the rather pompous man in charge of everything and Caine and Connery are dependably solid. It's refreshing to know that Ullmann's character, a wife and mother who opens her home to wounded soldiers, was a real life person and not someone just shoehorned into the film to provide a feminine presence. Generally, though some facts and scenarios were altered in order to work in the film, the movie keeps the story true to what happened. One case in which this backfired was the casting of youthful O'Neal as a Brigadier General, who really was the age of his real life counterpart, but who was derided by the public and critics for being all wrong. (Truth is, O'Neal, himself, perhaps, wasn't the right actor for the role, age aside.) Filled with plenty of action, gunplay, bombings, blood and a certain degree of gore, it's not necessarily an uplifting film since it demonstrates the futility that exists in warfare and more so the incredible waste, destruction and death in it.",Null,0,1,22 April 2009
Ocean's Twelve," The very definition of cinematic fluff
","After the considerable success of 'Ocean's 11' (itself a remake of a chummy Rat Pack 60's movie), Clooney and Co. returned for this flashy, but fairly empty, sequel. Set a few years after the casino heist of the original, this film has Garcia (the mark in the first caper) threatening Clooney and his gang with death unless they pay back every cent of what they stole, plus interest! (This despite the fact that he's already received an insurance settlement!) Since the eleven men have already spent more than a little of the dough from their caper, they must come up with a plan to steal even more, this time traveling to Europe. Following one unsuccessful attempt on a wealthy recluse, the team conspires to snatch a priceless Faberge egg for a fellow thief (Cassel) who has agreed to pay off their debt if they can capture the item. Unfortunately, Cassel actually makes things harder for the team as he wants to maintain his reputation as the world's premiere burglar! Things fall apart fairly quickly, forcing Clooney's wife Roberts to attempt to aid him (in one of the film's most controversial plot maneuvers.) The film alternates somewhat uncomfortably between loud, frenetic moments and languorous, quirky ones. The director is to be admired for attracting all of the original cast members for this sequel, no matter how little they are utilized in the plot (some of the actors on view have precious little to do), though they were surely compensated with lots of good times on location as noted in the press throughout filming. Clooney and Pitt still look good and provide some interesting moments and Zeta-Jones is great as the fly in their ointment, an investigator. Damon also does a fine job as the novice, trying to break through to the big time. However, there just isn't room to showcase the rest of the large supporting cast, especially with the many other billed and unbilled cameo appearances. Most of them are merely furniture in the sprawling tale. They take a back seat to showy cameos by folks like Jones and Willis. Garcia is pretty ridiculous, wielding a stick and strutting around in some bizarre get-ups. This time around, the methods and plot twists of the caper can't possibly be taken entirely seriously. It's all just too preposterous and fanciful to hold up to close scrutiny. Better to take the film as the unrepentant piece of fluff that it is and try to enjoy some of the beautiful locations, the glossy production design and the appeal of its leading players. Still, all that can only go so far in trying to put over a movie that is more than two hours long. At times it seems like Soderburgh and Clooney tried to throw in everything but the kitchen sink and the whole thing starts to turn in on itself. A lot of criticism was aimed at Roberts' joke on herself near the end of the film, but the bigger question is why did she go from an elegant and stylish presence in the first film to a wan and gaunt hausfrau in this one? Perhaps it was to make her transformation more distinct visually, though, to be truthful, even then she just doesn't look as good as one might expect. Did they run out of budget for some lipstick? There are a few stylish and striking moments in the film, but overall it lacks punch and certainly emotional investment as well. Most of the potentially-tense heist sequences are relayed in flashback or otherwise awkwardly handled. It's likely destined to become a camp classic several years down the pike the way some 60's films come off now.",Null,0,0,6 February 2006
The Bourne Identity," Another action franchise is 'bourne'
","Even though the timing wound up being accidental due to delayed opening dates, friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck went head to head with action thrillers in the 2002 summer box office season (both based on famous novels and doing rather well.)  This was Damon's entry and he came off better than expected.  He plays an amnesiac who soon finds out that he has a past full of violence and intrigue.  He's accompanied by Potente, a financially strapped girl who makes the mistake of getting involved, then can't break free of the drama surrounding him.  (Hard to believe but true, these parts were essayed by Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith in a 1988 TV miniseries!)  The film is stylish, nicely paced and, for the most part, more realistic and less showy than it's competitors (although a scene near the end involving a staircase shatters that whole idea and crosses the line.) Damon is comfortable and likable.  He appears to be doing much of the fight choreography and does it well.  He isn't always entirely believable as an amnesiac, but his natural charm goes a long way.  Potente takes a while to warm up.  She is more facially inexpressive than an American actress might have been, but eventually she comes along.  Damon shows little sexual interest in her until she's free of make up and he gives her a short hair cut (making her look a little more like Affleck?  hee hee!)  Naturally, he uses the world's dullest scissors, yet she emerges with a Vidal Sassoonish, up to the minute, eurotrash style.  Damon (looking awfully cute with dark hair and matching eyeliner) for some reason never has to adopt any sort of disguise while he's on the run!  The casting in this film is bizarre. Cooper, though a solid actor, hasn't got nearly enough charisma to pull off his key role.  Owen (who has STARRED in smaller, better films) is barely onscreen at all and not one word of his dialogue is intelligible!  Stiles is ludicrously miscast and unnecessary.  Aside from a very drab start, the film moves and has interesting locations, exciting set pieces and some nice production values.  Recommended for people who haven't read the book and for people that have read the book, but don't mind some tweaking.",Null,0,1,12 September 2002
The Village," Unusual to say the least, but interesting to those who aren't expecting blood 'n guts horror.
","Rarely do viewers agree completely on the merits of a film, but there is a relatively small collection of movies that place viewers into camps that either actively like or dislike them, sometimes rabidly, and this is one of them. Marketed (incorrectly) as a horror film, it is actually a mystery/character study. Viewers with preconceived expectations are nearly always let down. Those with very low levels of anticipation tend to enjoy it more. The story concerns a rather remote, rustic settlement that is surrounded by thick woods. The villagers live by an almost Amish or Quaker-like code and speak in old-style English. Despite their peaceful and almost Utopian existence, there is always the constant threat of invasion from or destruction by a group of forest-dwellers referred to as 'Those We Do Not Speak Of'. These creatures are occasionally glimpsed in the night, often by those young men who are assigned to watch the border of the village from a tall tower amidst a perimeter of glowing torches. Meanwhile, the youths in the village find themselves exploring the first blush of romance as they begin to pair up with one another while the Elders advise and counsel the settlement. Eventually, the tenuous relationship between the villagers and the creatures is sorely tested and one member of the settlement must attempt to reach a nearby town in order to save a beloved fellow villager's life. Ultimately, several twisty and (possibly) shocking plot elements are revealed which place the movie into a whole other category. This area tends to cause the most controversy among viewers. A remarkable cast was assembled and most of them do a very nice job. Howard, who emerged out of near total obscurity, performs admirably as a blind girl who winds up having at least as much strength as anyone else in the village. Her actual playing of blindness is, at times, unconvincing, but her acting abilities and her presence before the cameras are startlingly fresh and engrossing. Phoenix is excellent as the young man who has feelings for her. Unfortunately, he doesn't have quite as much screen time as one might like, but he is exceedingly good when he's on. Brody's performance is a matter of taste. He plays (literally!) the village idiot and at times seems to really over-play it. He and Phoenix, however, have one face-to-face encounter that is a stunner and Brody's role starts to make more sense upon a second viewing. Some very solid seasoned actors turn up as the Elders. Hurt and Weaver (who co-starred years before in 'Eyewitness') share a sort of tormented, unfulfilled romance and both give thoughtful, well-modulated performances. Other nice work comes from Gleeson, Jones and Weston as fellow Elders. One thing that director Shyamalan excels at is the setting of a mood. The film has a beautiful, yet haunting, pastoral look and feel to it. The audience is lulled into a warm and serene environment, but one that is tinged with dread since it's always clear that something it not right in the woods. Alert viewers will likely be able to guess the major plot twist near the end long before it is revealed, but that doesn't mean there aren't still a few surprises and jolts along the way. There is also an almost surreal scene between one villager and one creature that is harrowing in the extreme. If nothing else, the film is thought-provoking and a conversation piece, but for those in the right mood, it is also a fascinating and endearingly strange cinematic experience.",Null,1,2,9 August 2005
Cold Mountain," Worth watching even if 'brought to you by Mattel.'
","There are a couple of things wrong with this episodic, rather sweeping film, but not enough to destroy it. Fortunately, the good outweighs the bad enough to make it worthwhile viewing. Law plays a shy, but thoughtful young man in Cold Mountain, NC. When the local minister's daughter (Kidman) moves to town, he is immediately taken with her and they share a few very brief, very stifled moments (including an impromptu kiss) before he leaves to fight in the Civil War. (An opening battle scene is so intense that the impact of it literally tears the clothes off one participant!) As they each experience great change, disappointment and destruction, it is their longing for each other that keeps them going. He can't wait to get back to her and she can't wait for him to come back. As Law treks across the southeastern coast, he comes upon a wide variety of opponents and allies. These are all played with great skill by a terrific gallery of solid, semi-name actors (Hoffman, Ribisi, Portman, Atkins, etc......) Meanwhile, Kidman faces the end of her gentle existence and almost existence itself until a scrappy, brassy local girl steps in to rescue her. Zellweger plays this feisty, mouthy girl, using every ounce of her acting prowess. The pair must fend off an opportunistic home guardsman played by a slimy Winstone. The film lurches forward with the all-important reunion moment dangling in front of the viewers like a carrot on a stick. It is solely due to the acting talent and intense chemistry of the stars and not the sketchy, spotty script that this moment carries any dramatic weight at all. Somehow, Law and Kidman manage the impossible, which is to create a romance and desire for one another that is never properly developed on the screen. They are forced to create everything through their expressions and body language and do just that. As good as they are, they are almost completely overtaken by the surprisingly wondrous and intriguing work of Zellweger. Her welcome dash of vinegar and bluntness is a perfect counterpoint for the dewy and sensitive lovers. Also, of particular note is another surprise - the downright striking job that Portman does as a lonely widow and mother. She outdoes herself in this brief role. As a matter of fact, nearly every performance in the film is excellent. The one exception is the horribly anachronistic and inexplicable presence of the peroxide blonde henchman to Winstone. His punk-rock, eyelinered look and shopping-mall line delivery remove the viewer from the already tenuous time period whenever he's on screen. (And is it ever stated why someone his age isn't IN the war??) That's one other problem. There is very little period feel to this film. It always seems like the actors are playing with clothes they found at Western Costume with their make up done by Ben Nye. Kidman's hair, while lovely, is absolutely ridiculous. It distracts from and detracts from scenes very often. Ditto her make up. One key scene near the end is a close up and her heavy mascara and shadow grey/purple eyeshadow (masterfully applied by those Hollywood wizards) turn what should have been an agonizing emotional moment into 'Barbie Does the Civil War'. Zellweger does better in the make-up department, though her chemically-whitened teeth do not go very far in suggesting her character's background. Her deliberately tousled hair is also a problem at times, but nowhere near the level of Kidman's. These are quibbles in light of the bigger problem which is an overriding predictability. Even to one who has never read the book, there is no doubt as to the ending of the film. There is very little room for surprise and what there is of that is telegraphed again and again. So the audience is left watching a 2-1/2 hour film with a foregone conclusion. (And this sometimes meandering work was originally FIVE hours long!) The amount of footage left on the cutting room floor makes for some uncomfortable continuity (such as when a character is tortured and watches 3 family members slaughtered and is next seen smilingly dancing a Christmas jig!) Nevertheless, the romance and beauty of the film still delivers and there is no doubt that Kidman is a MOVIE STAR. She glows and glistens and has every accommodation made to her. Even her old riding coat looks runway perfect. Law is achingly beautiful in the early scenes, but delivers a sincere, dedicated performance in spite of his physical features (which are all but buried as it wears on.)",Null,99,152,5 January 2004
North by Northwest," Everyone works at top-form to create an enduring action masterpiece
","Having been created during one of director Hitchcock's most fertile periods, this is, as screenwriter Lehman put it, 'The Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures'. The movie throws in virtually all of the legendary director's favorite types of cinematic trademarks from his own walk-on role, a man wrongly accused, an icy blonde who may be dangerous, action sequences taking place in unusual locales and a MacGuffin, to name only a few. Grant plays an ad executive who happens to attract the attention of two henchmen who mistake him for a government spy. They kidnap him and try to extract info from him. Once they realize they've chosen the wrong man, they try to kill him, but he slips away, only to come back the next day with heated accusations. Rather than let the matter rest, he starts to investigate the situation which quickly becomes deadly for him and for others. He sets out on a cross-country jaunt from New York City to Mount Rushmore with both the police and the villains nipping at his heels. Grant provides a typically charming and suave portrayal. He deftly pendulums from serious concern to humor to romance. Supplying the romance is Saint as a sexy, mysterious woman he meets on a train. She does an excellent job of portraying her character's inner turmoil as well as the light sarcasm that goes with her sophisticated persona (though it's more than a little ridiculous when she states her age as 26. She was nearly a decade past that.) The chief bad guy is Mason, in a laid-back and coolly above-it-all type of performance. He's menacing, but never breaks a sweat, preferring to let his sidekicks take care of the dirty work. His primary sidekick is Landau, who can be perceived as (and was intended to be displayed as) a homosexual, though the suggestion is fairly subtle. Landis, only several years older than Grant in real life, plays his mother in an amusing turn. Other notable cast members include the sturdy Carroll, who worked with Hitchcock in more films than anyone else, and Lang, who would later go on to rage at Tippi Hedren in 'The Birds'. Hutchison, best known for her role in 'Harvey' plays a rather dubious mistress of the house where Grant is held and 'General Hospital's' Beradino plays a cop who picks up Grant for drunk driving. The film gets off to a smashing start with the captivatingly cacophonous score by Bernard Herrman and, while long, rarely lets up in its trek from one scenario to the next. Nearly all of the set pieces are memorable, if not legendary, including the trip to the United Nations, the corn field conflagration and most importantly the chase up and down the faces of Mount Rushmore. Here Hitch indulges in another one of his favorite touches, having Saint lose piece after piece of her striking ensemble and becoming more and more disheveled. Incidentally, the director's favorite costume designer Edith Head was not part of this MGM production, leaving him without her wonderful tailoring and clean lines. He rejected the costumes offered up by the studio and purchased the bulk of Saint's wardrobe 'off the rack' at Bergdorf-Goodman! Only one of the set pieces falls flat today and that is the drunken chase along a winding and perilous highway. Bad rear projection and some hammy close-ups from Grant render this one sequence less than perfect. However, that's quibbling when the rest of the film is so good. The ending (both the section involving the leads and the tag with the train) couldn't be more perfect.",Null,0,0,13 September 2006
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Goofy, oddly affectionate look at the roller-coaster life of a music superstar.
","The wave of reverent, dramatic bio-pics of famous singers that has flourished over the last few years ('Ray,' 'Walk the Line' and others) gets a quirky skewering in this well-appointed lampoon. Reilly plays the title character, a young musician who is haunted (and blamed by his father) over the death of his promising and gifted brother. With the promise of success in the music world made clear after a successful local performance, he takes off (with his preteen girlfriend Wiig in tow) for a climb to the top. Naturally, it isn't long before all the clichés are trucked out including infidelity, drug abuse, discord with the band and so on. Various genres of music are explored as Reilly hits it big with rockabilly and then tries to continue to eke out a career in folk, psychedelia and even TV variety-level disco. Along the way, all conceivable incidents and situations happening with real life troubled artists arise in order to be parodied. Reilly, who plays his character from early teens on (a jab at those projects which expect audiences to buy middle aged stars playing their characters in youth!), is so committed to this characterization that it becomes realistic, despite all the silliness. Not only does he give his part all the passion, annoyance and stupidity that it requires, but he can also sing quite well and does so frequently! It's a rare starring showcase for him and he acquits himself admirably. Wiig, as his wife and the mother of (many of) his children, lends excellent support, though her character isn't particularly fleshed out or even interesting. Fischer fares better in a flashier role as a sultry female singer who joins with Reilly for a (hilariously entendre-filled) duet and ends up with his heart. Meadows has a role as one of Reilly's band-mates who introduces him to increasingly dangerous and addictive drugs despite protestations that he shouldn't be coming near the stuff. Sure to come off more amusingly to those who have seen real films of this type, it nonetheless stands alone, bolstered particularly by a raft of great original songs. It's shocking that none of the musical numbers from this film were able to land any Oscar nominations, especially in light of the utter garbage that seems to dominate the category each year. To go further, the numbers in this film are integrated into the film, not tacked on to the end credits in desperation for a nod, like a lot of others. Not as wild as, say, a Zucker Brothers parody, there's still a large amount of zaniness. One of the most outrageous sight gags includes Reilly talking on the phone to Wiig amidst the aftermath of an orgy as a frontally nude man stands next to him asking questions about where his belongings are! It's a taboo-breaking moment that may help get some squeamish folks past their body shame. Another enjoyable aspect is the wide variety of clothes, hairstyles and furnishings that denote the ever-changing eras of music. Several name actors pop up in cameos (some more successfully than others) including Paul Rudd and Jack Black as Lennon & McCartney, who take Reilly on an LSD-fueled 'trip.' Though the movie is not intended to be taken seriously, Reilly is solid enough with his character to at least allow a viewer to connect with the story while chuckling at the absurdities that pop up.",Null,0,0,5 June 2009
Dreamgirls," A captivating version of the stage success.
","Sparked by the success of 'Chicago', this long-awaited film adaptation of the popular Broadway musical finally made it's way to the screen. A thinly-veiled take on The Supremes and their manager Berry Gordy, it details how three young black girls form The Dreams and move forward in the record industry, sometimes, unfortunately, at the expense of their personal happiness. A major rift in the group occurs when the manager (Foxx) determines that one girl (Knowles) should begin to sing lead instead of the usual, and more remarkable, one (Hudson) because she is more marketable and camera friendly. Knowles (who had a very similar experience in real life as the lead singer of Destiny's Child before breaking out on her own) is a pretty perfect fit for her role. She can sing, and does so well in the film, but is more known for her looks and presence on the stage. She is given here a staggering showcase of wigs, makeup, gowns, choreography and the like as her character experiences the heights of fame. She effectively conveys, physically, the essence of the woman she is portraying. Her acting isn't necessarily stellar, though it is a quantum leap from other things she has done. Foxx delivers a solid and low-key performance and is quite believable. Rose, who plays the third member of the group does a fine job as well in a role that garners less attention than the other two. Murphy appears as an established star in the mold of James Brown who gives the ladies their initial break into the biz. His performance is among the best he has ever given and he offers many shadings and characteristics to the part. Hudson, a newcomer who beat out hundreds of hopeful, sometimes more established singers for her part, is wonderful. Her acting, for someone with practically no experience, is exceptional, though she can improve in some ways. Her singing is phenomenal and she gets to deliver the most memorable and difficult numbers the show has to offer, and does so very successfully. It's an eye-opening, rather unforgettable debut. There really is no bad performance in the movie! Former Mighty Morphin Power Ranger Robinson is attractive and appealing in his role as Hudson's brother, Leal is the same in her part as a replacement Dream and Glover does very well in his role as Murphy's manager. All the other little parts are handled well and cast well. By now the storyline is a little bit clichéd and predictable, but it doesn't change the infectiousness of the material. The songs are lively and expertly performed, the sets and production design are evocative and the costumes and accessories are extraordinary. The film is an arresting, entertaining spectacle and so it can be forgiven if, occasionally, the back-up dancers do moves that are quite anachronistic or the occasional outfit seems just slightly off for the time period. Devine, who had Rose's role in the original Broadway production, pops up briefly as a cabaret singer.",Null,1,2,9 February 2007
The Exorcist," Moody, memorable creep-out with strong writing and performances.
","This ground breaking, starkly filmed thriller stands for many as one of the most terrifying films of all time.  (Conversely, a faction of agnostic viewers are left with a less jolting experience, sometimes even finding the film funny!)  Quite explicit for its time, it raised the bar in film-making for gore and realism and adult horror and has been emulated many times. However, it is set apart by its well-written (Oscar-winning, in fact) script and realistic performances.  Burstyn is an actress who begins to sense unusual behavior in her preteen daughter (Blair.)  The bizarre symptoms (open sores, violent thrashing, etc...) escalate as Burstyn seeks help from all conventional avenues.  Finally, she determines that Blair is possessed by Satan and must be exorcised.  Miller is a troubled priest whose own problems pale in comparison with the dilemma facing Burstyn.  When things get worse instead of better, it is up to legendary priest Von Sydow to attempt to rid the child of the demons inside her.  The sense of fear and dread is aided by the cold, claustrophobic settings and the use of the music 'Tubular Bells' during key moments.  The visuals are primitive by today's standards, but still provide jolts, notably Blair's explosive green vomit. Her celebrated 360 degree head turning has lost it's punch now.  The film is packed with gross-out moments and shockingly blasphemous episodes which work to upset and disarm the viewer.  Mercedes McCambridge helped provide the raspy, vulgar voice of the possessed Blair.  A disastrous and heavily panned sequel 'The Exorcist II:  The Heretic' starred an older Blair and Richard Burton.",Null,3,4,1 November 2002
No Country for Old Men," Remarkably divisive film with as many detractors as it has defenders.
","Based on a popular novel of the same name, this suspenseful character study traces the actions of three men tangled in a mess of stolen drug money, vengeance and pursuit. Brolin plays a low-income husband in 1980 Texas who, while hunting, comes upon the remnants of a drug deal gone bad. He discovers $2 million and takes off with it, but makes the mistake of returning to the scene later. Before he can even count the money, he's being pursued by various parties to the crime, primarily the driven, sociopathic and mysterious Bardem as a vicious hired killer. Attempting to sort out the mess, alternately trying to save Brolin and stop Bardem (who leaves a trail of bodies in his wake), is Jones, an aging sheriff who is finding his profession more and more futile. Brolin and Bardem play a very dangerous game of cat and mouse with Bardem stalking him through location after location and carrying one mean weapon, a pneumatic cattle gun that can knock the locks off of doors with one trigger pull. Jones uses Brolin's wife Macdonald to try to get him to give himself up, drawing her into the situation as well. Harrelson appears as another hit man, sent to retrieve the money for his own client Root. Brolin gives a terrific everyman performance, placing himself in a new category in the Hollywood echelon. He's a simple, stoic man with an ironic sense of integrity who makes a few wrong decisions. It's interesting to watch his resourcefulness unfold as his predicament worsens. Jones feels tailor-made for his role and effortlessly slips into the character's skin. It's an interesting counterpoint to the dogged and ferocious agent he portrayed years ago in 'The Fugitive.' Bardem is captivating and quite terrifying. His intensity, which contains just the slightest hint of dark humor, is amazing to behold. This exceedingly handsome actor is made to look almost ridiculous and yet he is a serious force to be reckoned with. His interchanges with various townsfolk and travelers are fascinating and tense to watch. Harrelson has almost a cameo role, but handles it effectively. Macdonald starts out seeming weak, but manages to turn in a memorable portrayal by the time of the dénouement. Harper appears briefly as Jones' supportive wife. They make a believable couple. Cute Dillahunt plays a green deputy, exchanging ideas about criminology with Jones as they investigate. Corbin has a small but effective bit part as a local man with a violent event in his past. Grant, humorously, but almost too cartoonishly, plays Macdonald's crotchety mother. A wondrous collection of actors gives quirky life to a variety of rural store owners, motel clerks and the like. The film has atmosphere and tension throughout. Surprisingly, but refreshingly, there is no music to speak of in the main course of the film. It avoids the traditional use of music which instructs the audience what to feel and when. Destined to be considered slow by some viewers, it takes its time to set the right moods and give full texture to the story and characters. Though many folks have lambasted the film for its inconclusive ending, it follows the book to a remarkable degree, up to and including the ending. Ultimately, it's a movie more memorable for its acting and its imagery rather than its plot line.",Null,2,4,8 February 2008
Mamma Mia!," Glowing, feel-good celebration whose merits outweigh its few drawbacks.
","The crowd-pleasing stage musical featuring the music of ABBA is brought to effervescent cinematic life here by the original director. Streep plays a single mother, operating a crumbling hotel built atop a Greek island and preparing for her daughter Seyfried's impending wedding and reception. Unbeknownst to her, Seyfried has written letters to the three men who could possibly be her father and has invited them to the wedding! Streep, who already has her hands full with the preparations and with the arrival of her two best pals and former back-up singers when she was a performer, is flabbergasted to come upon the men holed up in an old goat barn. While Seyfried tries to figure out which of the men is her biological father, Streep confronts long-buried feelings and expresses them (along with practically everyone on the island) in song. It may finally be official that Streep can play anything or anyone. While she is certainly guilty of overacting and playing with her hair far too much here, it matters not when she can provide the type of balls-out, ebullient, tuneful performance she grants the film. She, like many of the other participants, is a bit manic and over-expressive, but she's also contagiously energetic and delightful. Seyfried is excellent as well. Not only is she lovely to look at, but she also has an impressive voice and an appealing presence. The potential fathers are played by Brosnan, Firth and Skarsgard, each providing his own brand of charm. Brosnan was raked over the coals for his singing, but really its more the jarring sound of his singing voice versus what's expected rather than him being off-key. It's not a voice particularly suited to this type of music. He also overemphasizes his expressions during playback. Apart from that, he's handsome and likable. Firth is adorable, though he isn't given a great deal to do. Neither is Skarsgard, though he does the best with what he's given. As Streep's friends, Walters and Baranski are over-the-top, but like most others, they win the audience over with their antics and musical contributions. Cooper plays the handsome, young fiancé and is well suited to Seyfried. Rounding out the primary cast are newcomers McDowall and Lilley who play Seyfried's two best friends, echoing the relationship Streep has with her own pals. A (literal!) Greek chorus of villagers pops up throughout to either observe or take part in all the delirium. Director Lloyd does an excellent job of bringing the songs and characters to life. It's an unfortunate side effect that some of the hamminess wasn't reined in just a tad, but most viewers won't mind it that much. Hardcore fans of ABBA may not love seeing a (slight, to say the least!) storyline wrapped around the many famous songs, but most casual fans of the music will delight in seeing them performed with so much gusto and enthusiasm (and, in many cases, surprising skill.) It's either a concept that one is game for or is not. Those in the mood for a lighthearted and colorful fantasy (which does include some heart-tugging sentiment as well) should eat it up like candy. Grinches who expect a little more meat with their movies or who are allergic to froth will likely want to steer clear.",Null,0,2,19 September 2008
Batman Begins," Skillful, but drab, retelling of the Bob Kane character.
","With the 'Batman' feature franchise having become more and more cartoony, outlandish and obnoxious with each passing film, this fifth entry takes a leap backwards and reinvents the characters and tweaks the origin of the character somewhat, so that everything can be given a new spin. ('Casino Royale' would later take the same sort of path as it sought to freshen the successful, but tired, James Bond franchise.) Bale plays Bruce Wayne, a young man haunted by the back-alley killing of his wealthy, philanthropic parents who takes on the guise of the title character in order to combat crime and corruption in Gotham City. He is aided by Caine as the loyal family butler, Oldman as a faithful policeman and Freeman as an inventive employee of his family business. Neeson, Murphy, Hauer, Wilkinson and Watanabe portray opponents with varying degrees of threat and deadliness. Holmes plays a childhood friend of Bale's who grows into a district attorney and is one of the few non-corrupt officials in the town. The film is a visually arresting piece featuring several eye-popping locales such at the Himalayas, the Bat Cave, Wayne Manor and the CGI-enhanced Gotham City. It also takes its time, clocking in a wee bit too long. Oddly, in what is an All-American creation (that is, the character of Batman and his surroundings), the film is loaded down with British actors who, in all but a few cases, are portraying American characters. Holmes and Freeman are practically the only Yanks in the cast! Bale, who had to adopt two American accents, one for Bruce Wayne and a growlier one for Batman, actually did some brief harm to his vocal chords. Despite this anomaly, the cast is impressive and adds weight and presence to the film that might not have been there otherwise. Holmes, on the other hand, suffers by comparison and never looks like anything more than a little girl playing dress up. This is a darker, bleaker Batman than audiences have seen on the big screen and it attempts to do away with the day-glo colors and overtly campy performances that marked some of its predecessors. Unfortunately, some of the fun is missing as a result and this new, more shadowy and mysterious Batman manages to lack visibility in the film! It's hard to catch a good full-length glimpse of Bale in his suit. Also (such as in the first 'Superman' movie), it takes quite a while for the costume to appear in the first place. Another side effect of this grittier and more authentic approach is the introduction of a truly ugly Batmobile, a car that has previously had iconic status. Finally, never minding the fact that this is a refurbished and recycled version of the character, the finished product is incredibly routine and predictable with many of the standard storyline clichÃ©s in evidence. It's odd that so much work could be put into a vibrant new incarnation and then have it play out so ordinarily, though it was likely mandated by the studio, which is keenly aware that blockbuster audiences enjoy the familiar.",Null,3,8,18 January 2007
The Pianist," Beautifully tuned piece of cinema
","Far from the first motion picture to deal with the Holocaust and unlikely to be the last, this is nevertheless a stunning piece of film.  Brody portrays the title character (based on an actual person) who plays piano on Polish radio until the Nazi invasion of his country makes it impossible to continue.  Through his eyes, the audience witnesses the continual, seemingly-unstoppable dehumanization of Brody and his family and the virtual destruction of Poland.  The journey that this character takes, undoubtedly enhanced by director Polanski's own recollection of his early life, is almost incomprehensible.  Since so many films have been released on this subject, one can't help noticing the similarity to other movies and the familiarity of the situations depicted in the opening scenes.  However, the utter craftsmanship of this film and the casting (nothing short of perfection down the very last role) set this apart until the story's uniqueness kicks in.  Brody is nothing short of magnificent.  His face reflects (naturally and without mugging) the soulfulness, humiliation and deprivation of his character.  Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland.  Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity.  There is no opportunity to play 'spot the star' except for the most seasoned filmgoer.)  What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times.  Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing.  That is not to say that the film is easy to watch.  Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody.  The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films. If there are any faults in the film, they are few.  Perhaps some of Brody's experiences seem repetitive at times and the depiction of Germans sometimes approaches caricature.  However, all is forgiven as the story reaches its heart-stopping moment when Brody is attempting to open an all-important can of food.  Here the film reaches brilliance.  Clearly, the film is not going to appeal to the shallow or the disinterested, but to those who have a fondness for striking, deeply-felt and lovingly-told stories, this one is hard to top.",Null,1,2,19 January 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A delirious candy box of music and romance.
","Stylized.  Kinetic.  Hyperactive.  These words are understatements when describing this film.  The dream child of exacting and passionate director Luhrmann, it is a complete revitalization and rejuvenation of a long dead genre - the cinematic musical.  Annoying nearly as many people as it captivated, it is a thoroughly unique film with unending movement, color and emotion, all wrapped in a startlingly plush production design.  The story concerns McGregor, a naive young poet, who comes to turn-of-the-century Paris and becomes involved with the Bohemian lifestyle and ideals.  He maneuvers his way into writing a stage spectacular for budding star (and courtesan) Kidman and winds up completely falling for her.  Unfortunately, she is already spoken for by a sniveling, controlling Duke (Roxburgh) as arranged by her promoter/pimp (Broadbent.)  McGregor fashions a stage show around the story he is actually living and the two worlds become intertwined with Kidman at the center of both.  In a bold, but highly entertaining move, Lurhmann arranged for most of the music in the film to be contemporary pop sings filtered through an entirely new sensibility.  This adds all new dimension and texture to songs that the audience is familiar with.  The film begins in a wildly frenetic and jarring manner.  Viewers who like this or who can hang on through this will likely find themselves enjoying the rest. Others may be put off and have a hard time accepting the unusual and decidedly different reality that this film lives in.  Kidman broke away from her previous, somewhat middling career with this movie.  She burst on to the scene in a whole new light and has never looked back.  She is worshipped throughout by creative costuming, lighting, staging and especially by McGregor.  As fine as she is, her performance would be somewhat dimmed if not for the amazing, heart-on-his-sleeve acting and singing of McGregor.  He catapults off the cliff of emotional safety, completely exhibiting his adoration for Kidman and displaying a voice that is unusual, but exceedingly emotional and beautiful.  The two make a stunning pair.  It is inexplicable that McGregor was not nominated for an Oscar.  There is strong support from Roxburgh and Broadbent and a host of odd little characters, though Leguizamo is an acquired taste.  As the diminutive Toulouse-Lautrec, he is both affecting and annoying at the same time.  The plot is pretty thin and predictable (as so many musical plots are!), but the sumptuous elements of the production and the invigorating singing, choreography and acting make it soar pretty high.  This kicked the door open for other big screen musicals like 'Chicago' and introduced a generation to a genre that had been ignored for decades.",Null,1,2,7 January 2004
Casualties of War," Unsung, disturbing bit of war hell, based on a true story.
","In the wake of 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket' (and thanks to its release in the summer during amid less oppressive fare), this Vietnam era drama failed to make a big splash at the box office, but has earned a following over time. Fox plays an idealistic newbie, dropped into the hellhole of the conflict and assigned to a five-man team, which is sent to spot the enemy in advance of a major operation. The team is led by hard-edged, slightly off balance Penn, who is mourning the recent death of one of his pals. The remaining soldiers include violent blowhard Harvey, thickheaded Reilly and meek Leguizamo. Penn, in an unauthorized and startling move, decides to kidnap a young Vietnamese girl (Thu Le) and use her as a sex slave for the men during their trek. Some of the men revel in this plan, but Fox and Leguizamo balk at it. This sets up an enmity between Fox and Penn that affects both of their lives forever. Fox, whom many considered preposterous casting for a film this serious, does a terrific job for the most part. His tireless earnestness only becomes a bit much near the end and there are a few scenes that are perhaps deeper than he can go. However, he handles the bulk of the dramatic aspects well and fits his character nicely. Penn is an arresting presence and offers up a captivating portrayal, though he does go a bit over the top along the way. Similar to the way Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie did not communicate off the set in director DePalma's 'Carrie', the two men didn't socialize behind the scenes on this film. Harvey is appropriately slimy and menacing. Reilly and Leguizamo, in very early roles for them, are quite good at what they are called upon to do. (A special nod must go to the casting director who not only gave these two their tremendous breaks, but also gave future award-winner Rhames a featured role as Penn's superior officer.) DePalma crony Gregg Henry appears unbilled in the court-martial scene of the extended cut. Thu Le, an unknown actress who seemingly never did another Hollywood or other major project, is extraordinarily affecting as the captive. Based on a true story (and followed more closely than is sometimes the case with these things), it's a gut-wrenching, even haunting, experience. The landscape is breathtaking, the cinematography is lush, the music is excellent and the acting is often very strong. Depalma places the viewer into the situation and forces him to experience the events through Fox's eyes (with the sexuality being downplayed somewhat, though never the violence, of course.) If there's a significant problem with the film, it is probably the dÃ©nouement, considering the most interesting events take place during the middle section and what follows is either silly (the events in the lavatory) or repetitive (the reporting and investigation scenes.) The ending is even more protracted in the extended cut of the movie. Also, thanks to the heavily dramatic, slow motion, moan-filled climax, edited for maximum impact instead of for stark bleakness, there is very nearly the presence of unintentional humor. These issues aren't fatal, but they do detract moderately from the film's overall success. Still, it's a skillfully produced, emotionally stirring, thought-provoking piece of cinema that deserves to be seen.",Null,1,1,20 June 2008
The Great Raid," The subject matter overcomes some questionable casting to provide a moving piece of film-making.
","An unsung, but emotionally stirring, chapter of WWII is given a thoughtful, almost epic treatment in this reverent film, based on a true story. Following a defeat at Bataan, over 500 POW's are being held in a desolate, oppressive prison camp in The Philippines. When it becomes clear that Japan is losing the area, prisoners at other locations are being slaughtered and so Bratt and Franco team up to go in with their men and rescue their fellow soldiers, even though they are far outnumbered by Japanese forces in the area. Inside the camp, Fiennes is dwindling away from malaria while the woman he pines for, Nielson, is helping to run a resistance movement and is continuously smuggling quinine and other goods to him and his men. The title event is depicted with meticulous attention to strategy and with mostly realistic effects, with the film's credits capping everything off by featuring actual newsreel footage of the participants. Bratt may not be the first choice one thinks of for a film of this nature, though he does bear a passing resemblance to his real-life counterpart. He gives a solid performance though it is a touch overstated at times. On the opposite end is Franco who underplays to the point of stoicism and whose monotone voice suggests an almost total disinterest in the proceedings, whether he intended it or not. Bette Davis said, 'Always let them catch you acting just a little', but there's no evidence of that in Franco's somnambulant performance. (He brings to mind an earlier flash in the pan whose acting was uneven at best, Christopher Jones.) Fiennes suffers adeptly, having lost weight from his already slender frame for the part. Nielson does quite well if one can overlook the fact that, through any and all tragedy and torment, she never does without her crimson lipstick and camera-ready, deliberately-tousled hair! Unintentional amusement also comes from seeing her try to blend in with the Filipinos who are all about a head shorter than she is. The film is a tiny bit long, but it does have three concurrent story threads to tell. Any sluggishness in the middle is forgiven by the time of the exciting finale and the heart-tugging dénouement, accented by the terrific vintage footage. Some nice music helps to set the tone in many sequences as well. Consuelos does reasonably well in a bit part and Broadway actor Montalban has a small role as a fellow soldier. This very respectful movie, on a subject well worth spotlighting, was the victim of a power shake-up at Miramax and was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released without fanfare.",Null,1,2,9 August 2007
Rosemary's Baby," Virtually flawless piece of storytelling with Farrow's best work.
","Already a best-selling book when this film was made, the title has now become a pop-culture touchstone and this is regarded as one of the top psychological thrillers of all time. It all starts off nicely enough as married couple Cassavetes and Farrow move into an old, but richly appointed apartment building in New York. Farrow works overtime to transform it from a dark and old-fashioned place into a bright, sunny place to live...the perfect place to have a baby. When Cassavetes is handed a plum stage role, they decide to concentrate on conceiving a child, with the curious encouragement of their oddball, elderly neighbors Blackmer and Gordon. Still recovering from the apparent suicide of their border, the older couple takes a shine to the younger couple and soon have insinuated themselves into their lives. On the night that Farrow is most fertile and the pair had planned to attempt conception, she passes out and experiences a horrific extended dream in which she is raped by a demonic man as onlookers stare determinedly. Or did it actually happen? She finds herself with child, but her pregnancy is a monumentally difficult one, even with all the added attention and nourishment provided by Gordon and her pricey doctor Bellamy. Soon, Farrow realizes that there is far more at work in her life than just prenatal discomfort, but she has a hard time convincing anyone of it. Director Polanski is an absolute master of mood, tension and general unease. He expertly builds the paranoia in this film to an extraordinary level. Farrow (who, in the early sequences of this film is quite possibly at her highest level of attractiveness and appeal) gives an astonishing performance. Though she wasn't initially the actress Polanski wanted (which was Tuesday Weld), it's hard to picture anyone else in the part (none more so than Patty Duke, who appeared in a dire TV sequel in 1976!) She gives the part everything it needs and more: amiability, freshness, sexuality, warmth and most of all vulnerability. She is transformed from a lovely, happy woman into a wraith-like, ghostly stick-figure. (However, in one minor misstep, the makeup people whitened her face, but left her ears tan!) Cassavetes is strong as well, but perhaps overplays his hand a little. He does a decent enough job, but in some ways he isn't right for the part at all. His aspiring actor character is pushing forty and he is sixteen years Farrow's senior. A younger actor (like first choice Robert Redford) may have aided the mystery of the film a little more. Gordon, of course, steals every scene she's in with her brash, fussy ways and her distinctive voice. She was truly a force unto herself and seems to exist in her own atmosphere. Many familiar veteran actors turn up in supporting roles. In some cases, their previously benign personas are given a sick, darkly comic twist. Grodin is shown in one of his very earliest roles as one of Farrow's doctors. Farrow's female friends at her cocktail party are enacted by a trio of interesting actresses. One was Dr. Bellows' wife on 'I Dream of Jeannie', one was confidant and secretary to 'The Green Hornet' and the other was a 'Hee Haw' honey and Mrs. Kenny Rogers! Made prior to the MTV era in which everything must be spelled out, explained and shown in gory detail, this is a deliberately paced chiller that is far more focused on mood and audience manipulation. By the time Farrow is stuck in a phone booth (with famed producer William Castle making a cameo appearance) and frantically seeking assistance, the audience is desperate for her to find some way out of her predicament. It's top notch in all departments and has been cribbed from countless times since. Farrow, who was undergoing unbelievable pressure and personal trauma at the time due to her crumbling marriage to Frank Sinatra was inexplicably left out of the Oscar race that year.",Null,8,15,16 August 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," Must-see account of the agony and destruction of man against man.
","Every bit as meaningful as it was when it was first released over 75 years ago, this examination of the horrors of war is an eye-opening piece of movie-making for those who are used to the routine, almost-sterile, gung-ho war films that came after it (until a relaxation in censorship began leading to more realistic treatments of military carnage on screen.) Set in WWI Germany, it follows the enlistment, training and wartime experience (and in most cases, eventual death) of a group of young men, egged on to volunteer by their rather fanatical teacher. The bulk of the attention is given to Ayres, in a star-making role, who plays the most thoughtful, even-keeled member of the group. After envisioning all sorts of idealized perks and prestiges associated with becoming soldiers and war heroes, the cold reality sets in soon after the boys enlist. Their former postman is now a stern drill instructor, their personal comfort, including clothing, bedding and meals, matters not one bit to the German army and they are worked over continually in order to turn them into emotionless fighting machines. Once into battle, the men are practically overcome by the inherent hardships and torments of their daily lives. A hardened sergeant (Wolheim) takes some of them under his wing along with his sidekicks, burly Alexander and amusingly discontented Summerville. However, death and injury come swiftly and without warning to many of the recruits. The film is astonishing if for no other reason that it accomplishes so much visually and thematically despite being made in 1930, when sound film was in its infancy and camera movement was stifled by the process of recorded sound having to be put in synch with the pictures. No music score is heard after the opening credits, adding an eerie realism to the proceedings and allowing the endless shells and firepower to provide background noise. (Speaking of backgrounds, there is nearly always something occurring in the backgrounds of the film; passing trucks, marching soldiers, etc... giving the film an urgency that others sometimes lack.) There are many memorable sequences including a claustrophobic stint in a crumbling bunker, a face-to-face killing along with the emotional fall-out from it, a playful diversion of skinny-dipping and romance with a trio of French girls, a pair of decidedly unlucky leather boots and, of course, the unforgettable final minutes. The battle sequences here are startlingly realistic with all the dirt, grime, explosions, gunfire, hand-to-hand combat and graphic injury right there on the screen. The frank approach to sexuality and the carefree handling of semi-nudity will surely be a surprise to viewers used to films from 1934 to the 1950's. It makes one wonder how cinema would have progressed without the shackles of stringent censorship just after the beginning of the sound era. Though he isn't first billed, Ayres is really the leading man of the picture and is an appealing presence. He (and many others in the cast) can't quite shake some of the mannerisms and acting styles that were used in the silent films, but this isn't hard to overlook after a while. Top-billed Wolheim does an excellent job. His performance is as accessible now as it was then. Sadly, he died of cancer not too long after this film was released. Gleason, a beautifully handsome young actor who plays one of Ayres' cohorts had an unfortunate accident in 1945, ending his life. Mercer, who plays Ayres worried mother, was also felled within a few years of the film. Summerville, a lanky actor known more for his comic roles, appeared in the much lesser known sequel 'The Road Back' in 1937. Once seen, the film's message that war is hell isn't easily shaken. The film benefits from a repeat viewing in order to fully digest the sizable cast of young men and watch their stories unfold.",Null,2,3,20 October 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Great epic film-making with strong acting, direction and production values.
","References to this WWII film almost always consist of the whistling, marching soldiers and the climactic tussle over the title bridge, but first time viewers may be surprised at what other great things there are to be found in it. Holden plays a slightly shifty American POW, slaving away in an Asian camp as commander Hayakawa tries in vain to complete a railroad bridge that will open up more territory for the Japanese to conquer and control. When new arrival Guinness is brought in with his band of officers and other enlisted men, he and Hayakawa form a stand-off, with Guinness refusing to take part in the bridge-building and Hayakawa going to almost any lengths to make him. Holden makes a break for it and is recruited by Hawkins to go back and destroy the bridge, but by then Guinness is so proud of his work on it that he loses sight of the big picture. Holden finds himself up against one of his own allies when it comes to stopping the bridge from fulfilling it's purpose. Director Lean took his cast deep into Ceylon to give an authentic and lushly gorgeous setting to his story. There are eye-popping sights of the landscape (just as his later 'Dr Zhivago' and 'Lawrence of Arabia' would also include), notably a massive and beautiful waterfall. Top-billed Holden has to take a back-seat to the far more intriguing character Guinness plays, but he adds a degree of charm to the film, at times providing the comic relief, and does get one strong scene against Hawkins. Guinness is superb as the impossibly stalwart and stern Colonel who lets his pride in his duties and in his work distract him from his overall commitment to his country's cause. Veteran actor Hayakawa does well as the antagonist, though he doesn't really get a particularly showy scene to chew on. Hawkins is solid and there's a fresh, nice performance from Horne as a green lieutenant who comes along on the mission and gets more than he bargained for. The film has a deliberate pace and takes its time to set up the characters, but the acting is so fine and the scenery so striking that it rarely seems too oppressive. Though their scenes are sometimes just a little too precious and unexpectedly romance-oriented, there are several Asian women to give a dot of female persuasion to the film (along with Sears' brief role as a nurse who can't quit with the bedside manner.) A beautiful musical score is often forgotten in the wake of the more famous Colonel Bogey March. Though the outcome of the story has been revealed in many film retrospectives and TV clips, there is undeniable suspense as the situation intensifies at the end. In all, it's a very satisfying film with great performances and sure-handed direction, consisting of far more action and drama than just soldiers whistling while they march.",Null,1,3,27 December 2004
Paths of Glory," Masterful achievement in all departments.
","A passion project of Douglas's, in which he was willing to knowingly make a film less box-office friendly in order to preserve its theme and integrity, this examination of power and the abuse of it is a stellar piece of film-making. He plays a colonel in the French army during WWI, situated in a standoff along trenches against German-held territory. When general Macready realizes he can receive a promotion by turning the tide of the standoff and taking a locale known as The Ant Hill, he sends Douglas and his men into almost certain death in order to make it happen. However, the military effort is an abysmal failure and, in order to make an example of them, he has three men selected to stand trial for cowardice. What follows is a kangaroo court martial in which the prior deeds of the men are ignored and the situation is twisted in order to ensure that the trio will be found guilty. Douglas struggles against the odds to find a way to save them, even daring to tangle with smooth, but dangerous, general Menjou. Douglas turns in one of his all-time greatest performances, only getting close to the edge of over-acting one time as he confronts Menjou. He's charismatic, idealistic, realistic and compassionate, among other traits. Macready enjoys possibly his finest hour as well as the hardened, heartless, driven instigator of the entire mess. Menjou is perfectly slimy; all smiles even as he's turning the screws on people. The three targeted men give uniquely compelling performances. Meeker, often an underrated actor, wrestles with the thoughts of never seeing his wife and child again. Turkel reacts violently to the situation, ending up severely injured. Carey, always a fascinating presence, starts to crack up emotionally, becoming almost surreally affected. Other key cast members include Morris as a lieutenant who actually is cowardly (and alcoholic) and yet isn't made to suffer for it (this weak, wormy character was portrayed by a man, Morris, who was in real life an actual war hero!), Anderson, as a smugly sycophantic prosecutor and Meyer as the pragmatic, resident chaplain. If there is one teensy 'flaw,' it is that these men rarely, if ever, seem French, many of them retaining noticeable New York accents, but it's carping to even mention that in the face of such exemplary cinema. The movie, filmed in stark black and white, has the distinction of being simultaneous ugly and beautiful. One admires the stunning camera-work, even in the muddy, deadly battleground and can awe at the startlingly beautiful makeshift courtroom as injustice reigns over the proceedings. It's a sort of visual uneasiness that permeates the bulk of the film and only adds to how special it is. Despite the feeling of dread that lingers in many frames, there is also a tiny bit of ironic dark humor that seeps in from time to time. In short, director Kubrick has excelled here at manipulating the audience in every way from visually to audibly to emotionally. At a crisp 87 minutes, it never overstays its welcome. If only modern filmmakers could recognize that bigger and longer doesn't always equal better. The callous power plays depicted here could apply to virtually any place, not necessarily the French Army. Boardrooms, playgrounds, fraternities, Elk clubs It's the examination of the personalities and machinations that is key here rather than the setting. It's a must-see film that packs a wallop and which has not been given its full due even now.",Null,0,0,7 August 2008
Carrie," Christina Crawford thought SHE had it bad?!
","It doesn't take long for this film to demonstrate that it isn't any ordinary scary movie. Several minutes in, the viewer is shocked to be observing a bevy of naturally-arranged nude and semi-nude girls in a locker room, followed by a daring, sensuous and then horrific shower sequence involving its star Spacek. From this moment on, the audience should expect anything to occur, and often it does! Spacek plays a backward, naive high school senior possessing virtually no self-esteem and living a tortured existence with her fundamentally religious mother Laurie. Things are bad enough at home, with Laurie raging and preaching about sin and locking Spacek in a closet to pray, but at school they are worse, with Spacek receiving the type of ridicule and taunting that would drive anyone over the brink. Fortunately (?) for Spacek, she has an ace up her sleeve. She has burgeoning powers of telekinesis which reveal themselves in the form of jumping ashtrays, shattering mirrors and slamming windows. Then, when she believes she has overcome the horrid cruelty of her classmates, but is proved dead wrong, she unleashes a torrent of anger that results in a massive amount of destruction and demise. Spacek, who had only limited experience at this stage in her career, is excellent in the title role. She projects vulnerability, gentleness, desperation and rage with equal skill. It's a remarkable, unforgettable, actually, performance. Laurie, an actress who had toiled for many years in tacky period films and colorful fluff, came back after a long absence from the screen to inhabit the role of this maniacal mother. It's a huge, engulfing role and Laurie nails it. She's petrifyingly scary at times, though never outside the realm of possibility or believability. A raft of relative newcomers appear as Spacek's fellow classmates including Allen, as her chief antagonist, Katt as the school's big jock, Travolta as a dumb lug, Irving (in her screen debut) as an enigmatic student and Buckley (also making her debut) as a thoughtful, but stern, gym coach. Buckley, oddly, was only marginally older than the people cast as her students, but she pulls off the role very well. Some of the acting on the part of the others is weak, but the film is effective nonetheless. Making an appearance in a minor role as another student is pudgy comic actress McClurg. Pointer appears as Irving's mother, as she was in real life. The film is overloaded with carefully planned camera shots and creative methods of relaying the story by director De Palma who practically worshipped Alfred Hitchcock (and some would say stole a lot from him.) Not every single thing works (the split-screen used in the climax or the overly-dizzying dance between Katt and Spacek, for example), but so much does that the film succeeds anyway. It works on a visceral level thanks to the vivid performances of Spacek and Laurie and the overall mood of the piece. The score goes a long way in aiding the mood as well and is reminiscent of Hitchcock's favorite composer Bernard Herrman. A memorable, influential film, it ushered in a new approach to horror and thriller film-making.",Null,2,5,5 October 2006
The Birds," 'Why are they doing this?...the birds...Why are they trying to kill people?'
","Opinions vary somewhat on the virtues of this late-career Hitchcock suspense film. Some find it to be a symbol-laden masterpiece, others a dull drama with occasional flashes of shock and still others a mixed bag of thrills, lessened by a stiff leading lady. This is a mesmerizing, layered gem of a film with all sorts of great dialogue, set pieces and special effects. Though Hedren was not a seasoned actress in this, her debut, she is a sleek, chic, attractive performer. Her voice is a sophisticated purr, her posture and grace are magnificent and her hair is a testament to the wonders of Aqua Net. Despite her inexperience as an actress, she is a compelling and witty personality. She is not Grace Kelly, but who she is is fine as well. Taylor is a charming, delightful counterpoint to her cool beauty. There is so much going on in this film it can be watched over and over and OVER again. Watch as Tippi (in a theme Hitchcock used throughout his career, but which was fully realized here more than ever) begins with all the accoutrements of a glamorous lady and is gradually stripped of all her trappings and accessories until finally she is nearly unrecognizable. Notice how Taylor is 'hen-pecked' by the women around him. He is fighting off real birds as well grappling with the 'birds' (British for girl) in his life and in his home. Hedren starts off in a pet store surrounded by birds in cages, but before the film is over, she has been caged more than once herself (complete with the torturesome pecking--a reversal of humans sticking their fingers and other objects into birdcages all the time.) The only birds that don't rebel are the lovebirds...an unabashedly romantic touch. There are some odd bits of dialogue between several of the characters that aren't easily understood (i.e.--Pleshette and Hedren's discussion of Tandy, Tandy's bedridden chat with Hedren), but most of the film has fascinating exchanges, never more so than in the extended diner sequence. As patrons wait for their fried chicken, an array of people (including the terrific Griffies) debate the possibility of a bird assault, only to see firsthand how powerless humans can be when confronted by nature at full force. Some of the imagery is unforgettable, such as Tandy's exit from Dan Faucett's farm, the jungle gym at the school, Lang's confrontation with Hedren and the fireplace invasion to name a few... There is a deliberate quality to the pacing and story which puts some people off. Indeed in this channel-surfing era, it is sometimes hard for some to wait for things or to let a film's mood sweep over them. When things start to break loose, it is well worth the wait. Occasionally, some of the effects shots look dated, but in many cases it is still unsettling. One might never glance at a flock of crows quite the same way after seeing this movie!",Null,1,1,26 April 2002
The Wizard of Oz," A definite whiz of a wiz....
","Easily one of the top films of all time, this infectiously charming and meticulously crafted musical has become legendary and runs deep in the blood of anyone who saw it as a child and revisits it as an adult.  Garland plays a rather restless Kansas farm girl living with her aunt and uncle and pouring her feelings out to her beloved dog Toto.  The local crankpot is bound and determined to send Toto away to be destroyed for such grievous crimes as chasing her cat and running through her garden (and also snipping at her decidedly untasty leg!)  Just as Garland realizes that she has to face up to her challenges and responsibilities (after briefly running away) a tornado hits and she is konked on the head.  She awakens to an entirely different world (called Oz) in which great beauty is tempered by even greater evil.  She finds herself at odds with the Wicked Witch of the West (Hamilton) who will stop at nothing to destroy her (and her little dog, too!) while she desperately tries to reach the title character whom she hopes will get her back to Kansas.  Along the way to the Wizard of Oz, she is joined by a trio of equally needy friends.  The Scarecrow requires brains, the Tin Man wants a heart and the Cowardly Lion longs for courage. Together, they brave the Witch's scare tactics and set out to achieve their personal goals.  It turns out that the foursome always had the things they desired, they just never really realized it.  This is a rather clinical deconstruction of what is a magical and psychologically affecting tale. The story works on many levels and contains endless parallels (driven home by the fact that many of the people in Garlands home life appear as the characters in Oz.)  It's observation of human desires and needs could be dissected for hours.  Beyond that, the entire film is jaw-droppingly beautiful (even the 'drab' opening and closing sequences shot in a sepia tone.)  With expert talent involved in the production (Cedric Gibbons, Adrian anyone?), it's an eye-popper throughout and an aural delight as well. The songs (with peerless tongue-twisting lyrics) approach Gilbert & Sullivan greatness at times with Garland's unforgettable rendition of 'Over the Rainbow' just one of many gems.  All of the acting is top-notch. Garland's portrayal works because she completely buys into the story.  She believes and so the audience believes.  Her almost unfailing optimism gains greater irony when compared with her own troubled life.  Bolger, Haley and Lahr forge an iconic, thoroughly enjoyable trio, each getting the chance to show off his considerable comedic and musical talent.  Morgan plays virtually everyone of note in Oz and gives great presence to each characterization.  Toto is one of the true great screen canines.  It's impossible not to root for him as he scampers across rough terrain to find help for his owner.  The real blood-curdler here, however, is Hamilton. She crafts a character so vile, so menacing and so relentlessly evil that it's hard to ponder anyone else in the role.  Every gesture, every inflection of her voice seems calculated to drive kids under the covers (and has....for generations.)  Someone bitter or bored, with no sense of awe, may find ways to pick at the story or the technical aspects of a film that's more than 60 years old, but most everyone will be enchanted by (and moved by) this one of a kind piece of film history.",Null,3,4,29 January 2004
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Typically zany Ferrell flick, needling the NASCAR set.
","Ferrell, a certifiably unhinged comedian if ever there was one, reveals his track trash personage in this uneven, but sometimes hilarious farce. He plays a man, born in the backseat of a speeding car, who possesses a lifelong love for going fast. His deadbeat father Cole, a would-be racer himself, instilled in him the need to win at all costs. Meanwhile, his best friend Reilly supports him to that end while never getting a chance to revel in his own racing glory. Ferrell seemingly has it all; the mansion, the collection of cars, the busty trophy wife (Bibb) and two (impossibly impolite) sons. Unfortunately, his ego has grown along with his wealth and fame, so when gay, French Cohen appears out of nowhere to challenge him on the track, he risks falling very far if he loses. Ferrell, as usual, completely buys into the characterization with no regard for his own vanity (one recurring gag has him running around in some baggy briefs and a helmet!) Some of his jokes are a little indulgent, such as the endless dinner prayers featuring the many incarnations of Jesus, but most of his stuff is pretty amusing here. He's armed the film with a battalion of solid comic performers in supporting roles as well. Bibb is dead-on as the shallow, but sultry, wife, Reilly has just the right blend of dim-bulb amiability and Cole is excellent as the no-good, emotionally bankrupt father. Lynch plays Ferrell's put upon mother and is strong as well. As Ferrell's children, Tumlin and Russell are afforded some real ear-opening bits of dialogue! Adams is appealing in a smallish role as Ferrell's supportive personal assistant. Best of all is the uproarious Cohen who adopts a hysterical accent and who essays his role with captivating arrogance. (Allegedly, this character was partially inspired by real life racer and 'Dancing With the Stars' champion Helio Castroneves!) Other comic performers aim, with varying degrees of success, for their own share of funny moments on the screen. One doesn't have to love, or even like, NASCAR in order to appreciate the humor here, the target is really the people who attend such events, though a working knowledge of that world may make some of the little cameos mean more. That said, the film runs the risk of offending (and indeed in some cases has offended) the core audience who enjoys NASCAR. However, Ferrell skewers just about every walk of life in his films and certainly did the same during his many years on 'Saturday Night Live'. It's just this segment's turn. If the racetrack fans can get past the jabs at their compadres, they may run into another roadblock with all the subversive, at times mystifying, yet hilarious, doses of homo-erotica tossed in every now and then. Most memorable, aside from a lengthy kiss at the denouement, is Reilly's description of a teenage modeling session! It's a deliberately goofy, at times surreal, piece of movie fluff that is quite entertaining for those who don't demand a great deal.",Null,2,2,21 December 2007
