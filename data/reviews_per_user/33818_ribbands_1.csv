The Blair Witch Project," Pretentious tripe
","An over-hyped piece of irritating nonsense. Deeply pretentious. Deeply boring. Left me with a feeling of being ripped off, both financially and intellectually. Very little character development, zero character empathy. Made me wonder is this really how American teenagers interact?  The only enjoyable part of the film was when the last of these dreadful characters had been killed so I didn't have to listen to their screeching any more.",Null,8,13,12 February 2002
