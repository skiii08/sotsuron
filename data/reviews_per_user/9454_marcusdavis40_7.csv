Blade Runner 2049," Too Pretentious
",I only went to see Blade Runner 2049 because i liked the original 1982 Blade Runner.I should have trusted my instinct the first time.I didn't like the sequel at all.If they were going to do a Blade Runner sequel to the original they should have done so back in the 80's and not wait 30 odd years to do it.I found this version incredibly pretentious and a bit too artsy-fartsy for my tastes.Harrison Ford doesn't actually show up in the movie until well past the half way part of the film.They should have left it alone and leave the original to stand on its own.,5,9,19,8 October 2017
Notting Hill," Couldn't Stand The Movie
","I remember when this movie was first advertised in the movie theatre. This is the first time that i'v actually seen this movie on demand on TV.Can't say i liked it much either just predictable ,corny ,boring,nonsense.I didn't even find it funny.Not much of a fan of Hugh Grant or Julie Roberts anyways.I always considered them mediocre talent.I never watch any of their movies.Also as i remember it The actual area of Nottinghill is a predominately black area.This movie portrays Notting Hill as lily white.Plus i didn't see anything of the Nottinghill Carnival.I figure if you are going to name a movie after a certain area in London ,at least portray it with some accuracy.",2,1,5,8 October 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Did'nt like It
","Watched this movie last week .I have to say that i did'nt like this one as much as i liked Infinity wars.I found it to be predictable in parts plus it was way too mushy for me in certain bits.There was way too much hype for this ,i came out of the theatre pretty disappointed .",6,2,4,4 May 2019
Black Snake Moan," I really enjoyed This
",Black Snake Moan is a very dark moody type of flick.Its very good and very well acted .Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci burn up the screen with their performances .Alot of depth and alot of heart .Samuel L Jacksons Guitar playing is very convincing .Apparently he learnt to play Guitar for about 6 months to get into the role.This movie is'nt for everybody but i really liked it just for the performances and the story .A great film.,8,0,0,12 June 2020
Arrival," Pretty Good Movie
","I just watched this movie called The Arrival.I personally thought it was a pretty good flick.The design and photography of the movie i thought was very well done.The acting i thought was alright ,my only beef was that i kept feeling that the movie was going to descend into some sentimental Hollywood mush at the end but it avoided that.But it did leave me a bit confused as to the lead characters memories were not memories but premonitions to her future.That aside it is a good movie.If you,re looking for an alien invasion movie that has lots of mindless explosions aliens destroying humans and all the other usual stuff ,you won,t get it by watching this movie.This movie has a lot more thought and intelligence.",6,2,7,1 July 2017
Wonder Woman," Waste of time
",My wife wanted to watch this movie so me being the dutiful spouse that i am i sat thru it.This has to be one of the biggest piles of garbage its been my misfortune to watch.What i want to know is how do these movies get green lit to be made in the first place?After watching this film i was asking myself didn't Hollywood already make a movie like this before with another superhero Captain America?Its almost identical except for a couple of key elements Wonder Woman was fighting in World War 1 and not World War 2 as was in Captain America.Total waste of time.,1,7,17,8 October 2017
Black Panther," I really liked it
",My wife and i just recently went to see the Black Panther movie.I liked it for what it was a very entertaining movie.Visually it was great very well made.It wasn't just a mindless action flick it was well paced and intelligent.The acting was top notch.,8,1,3,25 February 2018
