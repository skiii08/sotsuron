Alien 3," Well worth seeing.
","This film is, in my opinion (which I freely admit is unpopular), tied for second-best of the Alien films. The original is unquestionably the finest; 'Aliens' is a good action flick but fails to capture anything of the mood of the original; 'Alien: Resurrection' ties with 'Alien 3' for second-best on sheer strength of mood, style, and premise.My favourite element of 'Alien 3' is not even connected to the creature itself. The society on Fury 161 is brilliantly conceived, and Fincher's directing - this *is* the man who went on to make 'Se7en,' after all - brings it to gritty life. Ripley's reaction to this society of devoutly religious thugs begins in earnest the hardening process that begins in 'Aliens,' and gives her perhaps the strength to make the decision she must at the film's end.Kudos to the clever way in which Lance Henriksen reappears. Disappointing was the hackneyed way in which the alien was finally destroyed. All the cast members - like the original, mostly British character actors such as Pete Postlethwaite - did very well with their roles. Well worth seeing.",8,0,2,7 March 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Tied for second-best
","This is the fourth film in the Alien series and, for my money, tied with 'Alien 3' as second-best of the lot, coming behind only the original 'Alien' in quality. I'm aware that it's an unpopular opinion, but I definitely think that, while 'Aliens' is a damn good action movie, it is a fairly ordinary science fiction movie, and the Alien series is first and foremost about science fiction.The plot of this movie is simple. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) died at the end of 'Alien 3,' and now, two hundred years later, the United Systems Military has cloned her and the alien queen inside her. Their genes have become mixed a bit in the cloning process, though, so while Ripley is now something a little more than human, the Queen has her own unique surprises in store.This is an absolutely beautiful film, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's direction is wonderful. The look of this film - both the sets and the aliens themselves, except for one - is fantastic. The actors are definitely competent, though Weaver, Winona Ryder (Call), Michael Wincott (Elgyn) and Brad Dourif (Gediman) stand out from the crowd. I must admit that I'm yet to be wholly disappointed by either Ryder or Dourif, and they don't even come close in this film.There *are,* however, problems here, or rather *a* problem. The last alien that Ripley must deal with, the nature of which I won't reveal, is a particularly uninspired piece of design. It's easy to see what Jeunet was trying to achieve with its look, but it comes off as tacky and, frankly, ridiculous. It's sad how such a potentially great film can have such a clear point at which it declines.Still, the failures of the last ten minutes aside, this is still a film well worth seeing. A particular highlight is the scene underwater; watch for the differences between the way Ripley moves and the other characters do, and see if you can pick up on exactly what she moves like.",8,0,0,22 March 2000
Batman Returns," A close second-best
","This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind 'Batman Forever' were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how 'Batman Returns' can be considered at all disappointing.True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in 'Batman,' a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's 'Richard III'), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.",7,2,7,21 March 2000
Alien," Brilliant
","One can not approach this film looking for mindless entertainment. I'm not claiming that it is thought-provoking or of great worth as profound social commentary, but what 'Alien' *is* is a science-fiction thriller that demands your full attention and involvement.There is almost nothing to criticise about this film. The actors are excellent, especially Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley), Ian Holm (Ash), and Yaphet Kotto (Parker). The plot is tightly-written and extremely suspenseful, with more than enough surprises to pick things up when the pace slackens.Speaking of pace, this *is* a slow film, but this is not to its detriment. It actually serves to heighten the tension - a particular highlight would be the final scene inside the shuttle.See this film. Now. I'm not kidding.",9,1,3,22 March 2000
