The Perks of Being a Wallflower," exciting. amazing. beautiful, perfect.
","I don't live in the US, and usually i feel that all the American high school movies are presenting such a different reality than in my location. but this movie is not one of those typical high school movies that i find it hard to relate too. sure, it's still different from my reality, but it seems more realistic, due to the fact that everything seems very real, and nothing is too extreme. and i loved it. i think that this is one of the best movies i'v seen, and that i'm about to see again and again. the topic is excellent, the actors are great, and everything in this movie is exciting and makes me relate to the plot more than any other movie i'v seen.loved it. go watch it. now!!",10,1,3,28 March 2013
