Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Amazing!!!
","I went and saw this film with my family last Saturday, and we all loved it!I would say that this film is definitely as good as the first, maybe even better! My mum fell asleep when she watched the first one at home, but agree'd with me that she did like this one. It was very clever the way that Sherlock could see how to fight his enemies before they even attacked him, and how he would even notice the tiniest detail of a crime scene. If you are going to see this film, look out at the last part of the film when Watson is writing a book about his and Sherlock's adventures, as he believes Sherlock to be dead, when actually he is sat in a chair just in front of Watson, disguised! It will stun you in the end how Sherlock defeats Moriarty, and you will be amazed at how he retrieves Moriarty's diary!Overall very, very good!!!!!There is also NO part/clip after the credits at the end of the film, as I stayed right until the very end!",9,1,2,9 January 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Amazing Film!!!!!
","AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!I saw this a few weeks ago in 3D and I thought it was amazing! Finally seeing the film that is was looking forward to for ages was really exciting! I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole of the film, it has all the elements to be the best film of this year and there are some really good contenders this year! There is a lot of action, suspense and you still have the hint of love in the story line. You have to feel sorry for Captain America when he crashes in Antarctica and gets frozen, then again when he wakes up in the 21st century without his lover. Overall this is one of the best films of year and, fingers crossed, could become the best film of this year!!!!! Also, if you are going to see this film anytime soon, make sure you stay until the very end of the credits as there is a trailer for The Avengers film coming out next year!!!!!",9,13,21,16 August 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Very Good!
","This film is very good!I watched the film on Friday night as my dad had bought it on DVD, and had seen the sequel just last Saturday! This film has got to now be one of my favourite's since I've seen it. I love it how Sherlock can predict what is going to happen before it does, and how the action scenes get slowed down, like when Sherlock is in the boxing match! The film also gives you an insight about who the bad guy is in the sequel. Professor James Moriarty. This film will make you jump, laugh and give you all the action you would want, but does not lose the amazing part when Sherlock figures it all out, terrifically fast, at the end! You will be on the edge of your seat through the film, and will be wanting more at the end! Lucky there's a sequel!Overall Very good!",8,1,1,15 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Very Good Film!
","This is the last Harry Potter film and what a way to end it!I was originally expecting the film to be better as it was a bit boring to start it off, but when you come to the battle of Hogwarts you just cant help sitting on the edge of your seat with your mouth hanging open, and as for then end of the whole Harry Potter franchise you will be impressed with this film! If you want to see one of the best films of this year then I recommend you see this one! I was, after watching the film amazed for weeks and wanted to see it again, I guess I'll have to wait for it to come out on DVD to experience one of the best Harry Potter films ever made! One of the best I've seen yet!!!!!",8,0,0,16 August 2011
