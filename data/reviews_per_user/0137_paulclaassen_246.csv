The Rock," Fantastic action thriller!
",Wonderfully entertaining action adventure. Sean Connery is in top form and perfectly cast. He is just such a good actor. The action sequences are heart pounding and the film actually also has emotional depth. 'The Rock' is one of my favorite action films. It is also one of Michael Bay's highest rated films.,8,2,2,2 July 2018
Ford v Ferrari," No frills; just excellent storytelling.
","Firstly, very good casting choices, so hats off to the casting department! The entire cast is perfect in their respective roles. I really enjoyed Christian Bale here. I think he was fantastic.The film doesn't have the flashy visuals one would expect from a film of this genre. It's not overdone like some of the Fast & the Furious films. It doesn't have endless show motion imagery. Instead, this is a straight-forward, well made film where pretty much what you see is what you get. And I loved that! The action scenes were very realistic. During all the action/racing scenes, the film also dished up a good dose of drama and suspense - and I loved the subtle humor, too! There are no comic relief characters, no slapstick humor; just very funny one-liners and incidents. There's also only the required amount of characters.This is an interesting film that will appeal to a wide audience, and is not primarily aimed at car or racing enthusiasts. The film offers so much more. The father-son relationship was beautiful and touching. It also offers a good insight into Ford Motor Company's history. The editing is quick, as you'd expect from a film that revolves around speed. The finale is really great. I enjoyed this film.",7,0,1,11 March 2020
Despicable Me 2," Not as enjoyable as the first film.
","Having enjoyed the first film, I eagerly anticipated watching this film. Uhm, unfortunately I was disappointed. This is definitely more for the younger demographic. I found some scenes downright silly. It only gets more interesting towards the end, albeit still silly. The minions steel the show...",3,1,2,6 July 2018
The Avengers," Oh boy...
","The movie was such a huge box office success that I tried really hard to like it. I just couldn't. Just to be certain, I gave it a second viewing, and disliked it just as much the second time around.Firstly, if you haven't seen Thor, Iron Man, Captain America or The Incredible Hulk, you'll have no idea who the characters are and what they're all about. There haven't been films about Black Widow or Hawkeye, so they don't really matter anyway. The film played like a medley of all of these super hero movies and didn't really offer anything we haven't seen in these movies. Also, due to way too many protagonists for one film, none of them were given the opportunity to develop. In fact, I found all the characters incredibly shallow, and didn't like any of them. My favorite character in the film is probably Hulk.Everything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable - within the context of the genre, off course. 'The Avengers' was so CGI heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it. The film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues. Everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot. Iron Man is just as annoying as in his own franchise (although he is the deepest character of all). So, a mere mortal in a suit Tony Stark (Iron Man) can actually outwit a god like Thor??? Wow, not much hope for gods... The same goes for the powerful god Loki, who is outwitted and outsmarted so easily.The action in 'Dragon Wars' and 'Transformers' was a lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this. I've seen it twice and that's more than enough, thanks.",4,0,2,7 June 2019
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Ultimately just too slow moving.
","Fantastic costumes. Fantastic photography. Fantastic visuals. Fantastic acting, notably Terence Stamp.After a promising start, their adventures ultimately takes a dip to near boredom, though, and unfortunately never recovers.",5,1,2,3 July 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Oh, just stop it already!
","Why is it that these films still manage to be box office hits? This fourth installment in the series is more of the same; too much of the same. More of the same silly humor. Jack Sparrow is not funny anymore, he is becoming annoying and Johnny Depp's magic is wearing off. This film can be used as a guide for writing cliches. And it is so painfully American!Despite the non-stop action and adventure and impressive visuals, I was bored because of the out of place humor and cliches. Romance is forced into the plot and is annoying and downright ludicrous. I honestly did not have fun watching this, although I must admit the Mermaid scene was really spectacular. And that's it! One scene. Just one scene I enjoyed about the movie.",2,1,2,23 April 2019
Howl's Moving Castle," Thoroughly enjoyable!
","'Howl's Moving Castle' is a very imaginative and unusual story. With magic, wizards and witches abound, this is an interesting and exciting fantasy adventure.The film is about several cursed people who desire a spell to be broken. Despite being cursed, Sophie continues to see the beauty in everyone and everything, and she is guaranteed to steel your heart for being such a good Samaritan. 'Howl's Moving Castle' is so much more than just an animated film. It sends out a powerful message of acceptance, and believing in yourself. It also illustrates how inner beauty is far more important than outer beauty.Through a series of weird and wonderful moments, with great animation, the film delves deep into the abyss of self-discovery and humanitarianism.",7,1,1,6 October 2019
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Not as good as the original
","Sherlock Holmes is back along with the original cast. While there's much to enjoy about this film, it wasn't as good as the original. It felt as if they were trying too hard to equal or better the first film. The film features even more witty dialogue than its predecessor, and more frequent as well. (Wow, that's a LOT of dialogue!). A significant amount of time is wasted on trivial moments, hence the film feels much longer than the already long running time.Guy Richie is back in the director's chair, yet the film is not nearly as visually stunning as the original. Nor is is nearly as masterful either. And not as interesting a plot either with conveniences left, right and center that diminishes all credibility. The humor at times felt forced and unnecessary. It even felt as if the actors had a difficult time reprising their roles.The scene at around the halfway mark where the characters escape is INCREDIBLE!!! This scene features some of the most amazing photography and visuals I've seen in a long time. Its a pity Richie did not utilize this style and effects throughout the movie. Its as if he put all his time and effort into this one scene and it was indeed truly awesome!As for the film itself, yes, it is a well made film, but I'd much rather watch the first film a few times over than give this one a second viewing. It simply did not do enough for my senses.",5,2,3,7 August 2019
Gremlins," Still a classic!
","Made in a time when they had to make use of practical effects instead of CGI, 'Gremlins' still holds very well by today's standards. It's hard to believe this film was made almost four decades ago!The film is an interesting mix of comedy and horror. There are some really silly, illogical moments, but 'Gremlins' is not to be taken too seriously. You might sit shaking your head wondering why the creatures would do the silly things they do, but hey, it's all in the name of fun, right? Since these are also fictional creatures, who's to say what they are capable of and what their behavior should be?Towards the end all hell breaks loose, and some scenes are disgusting (in a comedy-horror good way), and it's wonderful! The film has a good, fairly suspenseful, action-packed final act.",6,3,3,10 February 2020
Your Name.," Superb!
","Uhm...wow! Another exceptional animated film from Japan. The animation is stunning! You certainly haven't experienced animated films until you've watched an animated film from Japan. They are so different to the Hollywood films.This film is loaded with emotional depth and creativity. Although it is never explained how the characters managed to switch places, it really becomes immaterial once you follow the story. Around the halfway mark the film shocks us with an unexpected natural disaster that I never saw coming. From there on the film reverses, going back before the disaster, but this is when the film becomes more interesting. Since we are now aware of the impending doom, everything has more meaning.'Your Name.' is a sad, beautiful, uplifting film you have to experience at least once.",6,0,2,17 November 2019
Captain Phillips," Superb!!
",Very realistic film based on a real-life drama. Excitement and suspense from beginning to end. The music is super effective and Tom Hanks is exceptionally good as Captain Phillips. One of the most effective movies I've seen in a while.,9,1,2,2 July 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," So awesome...
","Absolutely brilliant! It keeps you guessing until the end and is not at all what you expected. Totally unpredictable! Truly unique and fantastic! A brilliant cast ensures credibility. John Goodman is excellent as the caring yet mysterious man, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is equally good as the victim/survivor. The visual effects towards the end are awesome. The ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, and honestly, I can't wait!!",7,0,0,3 July 2018
The Finest Hours," The film moves at a dreary pace...
","All the characters seemed incompetent and self-centered, and the actors acted lazily. There wasn't much enthusiasm here. Is it just me, or did everything and everyone seem to move in slow motion? In any rescue mission time is of the essence, and I didn't feel that urgency - not from the pacing or the music. Yes, even the music seemed bland. The film really moved along at a dreary pace. Also, for anyone familiar with the story, they would have known how it was going to end anyway, so there are no surprises. During the storm, the waves were inconsistent. At times there were huge swells and then suddenly close-ups on actors revealed there were hardly any motion. The actors just didn't blend with their surroundings, rendering it unbelievable. Its still a heroic tale, though, and I did enjoy the film's final 35 minutes, and loved the ending.",4,1,2,20 June 2018
Skyfall," The Best Bond film by far!!
","Having putting off watching this for so long, I can't stress enough how impressed I am with this installment in the James Bond franchise. Daniel Craig lends a humanity to the character no other actor has been able to do. The wittiness of notably Sean Connery and Roger Moore made way for a much more serious approach to the character. (Note that Connery and Moore were very good being witty and I'm not criticizing them. I just enjoyed the seriousness more).This is an incredibly classy action thriller with great cinematography. The film has some impressive action scenes, and great dialogue, too. Yes, there are the cliches of fleeing on the rooftops and fighting on a moving train, but this film takes it a few notches higher). I did find the film's running time unnecessarily long with some scenes dragging the film down. Cutting some of these scenes would drastically have improved the pacing. The film features some amazingly stunning visuals not seen before in any Bond film.Javier Bardem was exceptionally good as the antagonist, probably the most charming and different Bond villain yet. It was quite refreshing , actually. Judi Dench was very good as always, and Daniel Craig is just so damn SEXY it was an utter delight watching him. Daniel has a great body and they find perfect excuses to utilize this. I'm certainly not complaining.The last half of the film was almost too good to be a James Bond film. It was filled with more depth and emotion than any previous (Bond) film, and was actually quite suspenseful. The visuals during the Skyfall raid scenes are STUNNING!!! This is by far the best and most enjoyable 007 film yet! The film bears none of the trademarks of the previous films - Bond didn't even have a Martini!!'Skyfall' won 2 Oscars, with another 65 wins and further 120 nominations, which I believe to be the most awarded James Bond film ever. Well done, Sam Mendes!!",8,1,4,23 December 2018
The Hangover," Pass, thank you...
","Since I'm not a big comedy fan, it probably is unfair for me to review comedies.But let's look at the film for what it is. The story is about three guys who can't remember what they did the night before. Interesting enough concept. However, the film dishes up more than it can handle, and more than what is remotely possible for these guys to have done in a single night. Therefore, it is completely unrealistic - almost like a fantasy even. Stu marrying a hooker is unbelievable enough, let alone the wedding planner managing to print mugs, caps, coasters and other memorabilia in a matter of a few hours, and have it ready for them. That's just not possible, and no-one would believe this. Unless you turn a blind eye to the reality issue, off course.The acting is ok, although maybe a bit over the top at times. The film is demented and chaotic, which is not entirely a bad thing. Only, for a comedy it just wasn't all that funny. More often than not I just shook my head in disbelief thinking 'Really? You expect me to swallow all this garbage you're feeding me?'Some scenes were pure slapstick, and I hate slapstick. My favorite character by far, was Mr Chow (Ken Jeong). He was funny. Unfortunately, this film just didn't do it for me, though...",4,0,4,3 December 2019
Ghost," So many genres blend together so seamlessly. Perfection.
","Probably one of the most romantic and emotionally charged films I've seen. Interestingly enough, it is also hilariously funny (mostly thanks to Whoopi Goldberg) and suspenseful. When the film was first released, the industry was skeptical about the film due to the many elements mixed together: comedy, romance, action, fantasy, suspense.... The film has in interesting, yet relatively simply plot, excellently executed by a brilliant cast. The film also very successfully revived the song 'Unchained Melody' by The Righteous Brothers, sending it to the top of the charts.",10,3,3,3 July 2018
Iron Man 3," I'm NOT a fan!
","I've never seen a movie where SO MUCH happens at the right time, the right place at the right moment. Too much just happens by chance and for the sake of making the movie work. Nothing is justified. Some good scenes, but overall way too much CGI and unconvincing storyline. Stark's character has become one-dimensional and painfully predictable, and quite annoying, actually.",3,0,2,6 July 2018
The Ring," Great mystery horror thriller.
","Based on the Japanese film 'Ringu' of 1998. The film is believable thanks to good acting (especially Naomi Watts) and clever editing. Although the film does contain horror elements, it is more of an adventure mystery thriller. I enjoyed the unraveling of a mystery aspect, and discovering how all the pieces fit together. The film also features some very good and effective visuals. It is also quite scary at times - thankfully no thanks to overbearing blasts of music, but due to disturbing images or effects that are truly scary. This is a unique idea excellently executed.",7,0,0,20 August 2018
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Despite many flaws, this is truly entertaining.
","There's so much here to love and so much to loathe. Much of what happens can only happen in a comedy and not a serious action adventure. Too much is unbelievable and for effect and the convenience of the story only.Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones and makes a likable hero. The only problem I have with this character, is how easily (and seemingly mercilessly) he randomly kills people. Interesting, considering he is a professor. Marion (Karen Young) just as easily kills people left, right and centre without blinking an eye. But then again, we don't really know her background, so she might be a cold-blooded killer for all I know.The slapstick humor at times ruins the suspense and excitement of the film, but I suppose Spielberg didn't want to make the film too serious (interesting then where all the killings fit in if not to be taken seriously...).The action and adventure is non-stop and it truly is entertaining. I love archeological action adventure films. I thoroughly enjoyed the locations as well, and the fact that the film was shot on location - a term that might be a phenomenon in the near future no thanks to CGI. I also enjoyed all the practical effects and the loads of stunts the film has to offer. They also used 7,000 real snakes for the film, instead of CGI. That's what I love about films from the 80's. This was still real film making, instead of doing (almost) everything from behind a desk!If you don't take the film too seriously and overlook the many plot flaws (and that very weird ending) then this is a film to enjoy again and again purely for the adrenaline rush. They simply don't make them like this anymore...",5,0,3,29 July 2019
Deepwater Horizon," One of my favorite disaster movies.
","Based on fact, this was truly fascinating. Director Peter Bergh had an interesting vision for the film with excellent photography, and great attention to detail. The sound was also incredible. The film is an absolute masterpiece - from the great cast to the mind blowing visual effects. The music was awesome and highly effective. The build up to the disaster was very well done with tension almost from the start. Once the action started, it grabbed hold of you and never let go, as it plunged the viewer deeper into the 'well from hell' with every frame. It was simply spectacular and one of my favorite disaster movies.",8,0,1,16 June 2018
United 93," Sad and heroic
","The first thing I noticed was how realistic the film is - mostly thanks to clever photography and a relatively unknown cast. I found this very sad, fascinating and incredibly well done. It is one of those films that causes a lump in one's throat since we know the fate of the passengers from the very first moment.",7,0,0,9 September 2018
It," Not compelling enough. Not scary.
","There's something very disturbing about a monster hunting kids! This being said, as well, the film is definitely not for children. The film reminded me so much of 'Stand by me' but with a horror twist. This is no doubt a classy piece of work, very well done with a superb young cast. I did find it a bit slow moving, though, with not too much happening, as well. It finally became quite violent, and I'm talking domestic violence here, not from a horror point of view. I get it, the monster lives on children's fear, but it became rather disturbing on an entirely different level. I did not find the film compelling enough, although Pennywise was well acted by Bill Skarsgard and also rather scary at times. The film in general was not scary at all, mainly because 'nothing was real'. The Well House also looked very similar to the house in 'Monster House'.Mother hen, the effects during the climax was great!",5,0,2,20 June 2018
Hereditary," Disturbing as hell!
","In how many ways can I describe how disturbing this film was? This horror film is not unsettling because of gore or other typical horror elements, it is difficult to watch due to the mental and psychological implications. The acting is so incredible that you actually feel the pain with the characters (and I'm again not referring to physical pain). Toni Collette, Milly Shapiro and Alex Wolff were so good, it felt like watching real life unfold in front of your very eyes. Alex Wolff in particular was astonishingly good after the unexpected car accident that shocked me so intensely that I literally froze, and paused the film to contemplate what just happened. Gabriel Byrne is a brilliant actor, but he wasn't really given much to do in this film, as he was the only one trying to keep it (and the family) together. He was very reserved, but still played a vital role. His character was in direct contrast to the rest of his family.The film is very, very well made and very realistic. The film gets more surreal towards the end, but remains stylish and effective. The ending might be a bit confusing and therefore deserves more viewings so you can pay attention to all the details that actually forewarn you what is to come (but you'll only take notice of this once you've seen the ending). The ending might also offend a lot of viewers, but as I said in the beginning: in how many ways can I describe how disturbing this was...",7,0,2,16 November 2018
John Wick," John Wick: Hero or mass murderer?
","Critics and audiences around the world raved about 'John Wick'. What did I think? Uhm, still deciding. The film starts off with so many Hollywood cliches: the flashbacks to tell the back story, the rainy weather funeral with black umbrellas... Yes, Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as John Wick. Yes, the action scenes are non-stop and brutal. Yes, the stunts were awesome. Yet, I still didn't enjoy the film. The film has a bodycount of note, you'd think it's a John Woo film! This is just way too violent for my liking with way too much unnecessary killings. Sure, Wick was out for revenge, but this is a very extreme vengeance film. I realize he did not go on a killing spree because they took his car and dog from him. The reason for his revenge goes much deeper than that, I get it, but still...Does this justify Wick killing over a hundred people? Although it is never mentioned in the film, it is obvious Wick is an ex-hitman and therefore probably does not have a conscience, but I can't help but feel this character goes completely beyond revenge. On the contrary, it becomes cold-blooded murder instead. Also, I understand Wick was one of the best hitman, but is it possible that he can outwit and dodge so many hitmen in the club? If this is the case, this organisation seriously need new hitmen!The film also features the 'no gun' ending fight scene. Seriously, Hollywood, this is SO cliched and annoying! If Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), the crime boss, wanted John dead, why didn't he just shoot him? Why would a man in his sixties opt for a fist fight with someone as highly trained as John Wick, instead of just shooting him? This scene was not credible at all. Is it a film I'd watch again? Nope. (I must mention I absolutely loved the soundtrack.)",4,0,0,10 June 2018
Rocketman," Wonderful fantasy musical!!
","'Rocketman' could easily have been just another biopic. Instead, it is a beautiful fantasy musical. I thought it kinda weird at first watching a documentary film about an artist who is very much alive still. But eventually realized the film only documents his life until the 70's.Even if you're not an Elton John fan, this is a film that will appeal to everyone. The musical scenes are wonderful, colorful and vibrant. I also rather enjoyed the different versions of some of his popular songs.Having done a bit of research on Elton John - and with Elton as executive producer - 'Rocketman' is a pretty accurate depiction of the music icon's life. The attention to detail is incredible. Elton was a flamboyant, outspoken and openly gay man in a time when homosexuality was still a controversial topic. Interesting also, was the fact that Elton actually married (a woman) 'to try something new'. Needless to say it didn't pan out so well. For those who still didn't realize Elton was gay (yeah right!), the film might reveal more than you wanted to know about the superstar. Taron Egerton's performance as Elton is wonderful!I also enjoyed the fact Bernie Taupin features prominently in the film, being the brainchild behind most of Elton's chart topping songs. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Rocketman' and it's feel-good ending. Loved it!",7,1,1,8 May 2020
A Star Is Born," Sorry, I just had absolutely no fun with this...yawn...
","Every now and again a film comes along that rakes in the awards and is praised by critics, yet that I don't enjoy. 'A Star is Born' is such a film.The film falls completely apart as a love story. The relationship between Ally (GaGa) and Jack (Cooper) moves along so quickly that it is simply not believable or interesting. The movie itself is moving at a snail's pace, though, and I found it terribly boring. Wow, I mean BORING! On top of that Bradley was mumbling so much that I could hardly hear what he was saying most of the time. Was this done intentionally in an attempt to make it feel more realistic??I liked the music - and that's as much as I enjoyed about the film, although - towards the end - even the music started to bore me. It felt as if the film was written for GaGa about her life. (The ending just hasn't happened for her yet...).Yawn. What a horrible movie experience this was. I honestly couldn't wait for this to end.",1,10,15,5 May 2019
Gravity," Nothing believable about this yawner.
","Why is it called Gravity when there's zero gravity for most of the film? Wow, this was a lot of floating and spinning and deja vu. Could it have been any more dragged out? At times it felt the film wasn't moving forward at all and I wanted to give it a push. How much of the same thing can one stomach in one film??? They could easily have shot this film in a small, square blue screen room, since they hardly did anything and everything was CGI anyway. Why is a medical doctor fixing things on a space ship anyway? And why is the astronaut telling the doctor what happens when you run out of oxygen, and how you should act? The final moment as the craft entered Earth's atmosphere was quite spectacular, though...oh well, about 3 minutes or so...Yawn.",2,0,1,18 June 2018
Lone Survivor," Not my cup of tea, thanks.
","The film's title along with the poster give the story away: Lone survivor - with an image of Mark Wahlberg. Talk about spoilers before you've even started watching the film!! So, from the very beginning I knew what was coming - it was simply a matter of when and how. The film got off to a very slow start. In fact, an hour into the film I was still waiting for something to happen. Anything!The film is about four guys trying to survive against all odds, but - as mentioned - the title already gave it away, so there was very little suspense and no surprises. The film delivered exactly as indicated. The tagline says 'Based on true acts of courage'. Am I missing something here? How were they being courageous? They were fighting for their lives, yes, the same anyone in their situation would have done.I realize this is based on fact and I do sympathize with those affected by the tragedy, but as a film it made for boring viewing. The action was merely guys shooting and being shot at, and falling or jumping off cliffs - again and again. I actually couldn't wait for this to end. The last few minutes were action-packed, but by that time I honestly couldn't give a damn anymore. There's so many reasons why I did not enjoy this. On a positive note, the directing was very good, and the photography was excellent. All the actors were good and believable, as well. You could literally sense their agony.",4,1,3,8 August 2018
Wind River," Interesting enough, but oh the slow pacing...
","Seeing the trailer to 'Wind River' I wasn't really interested in seeing the film, as it seemed boring. Then I read about critics raving about the film and decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.This is indeed a very well made film and a very stylish thriller, with beautiful cinematography. However, my instincts were right: I found the film dreary. Not that it wasn't interesting, but the pacing was just too slow. At times I could hardly hear what some of the actors were saying, especially Jeremy Renner. Kelsey Asbille (playing FBI agent Natalie) was the only fish out of water in the harsh territory the film is set in, and she was by far the most determined and strongest character.The film also made me realize how every moment can be your last. The back flashes of the doomed couple were the film's best moments, until the final moment when I literally cheered the antagonist's fate!",5,0,1,27 November 2018
Train to Busan," Spectacular!!
","This is the best zombie film I've seen. The effects are incredible and the acting great, too - especially Su-an Kim (who was also fantastic in Battleship Island). The film is insanely suspenseful at times as we follow a divorced father and his daughter trying to escape the zombie apocalypse. Unlike most zombie films, this film has depth and emotion, and beautiful music, too.",10,11,22,13 July 2018
Train to Busan," Zombie film with emotion.
","Nominated for 33 awards (winning 9 so far), this is the best zombie film I've seen.

Memento," Uniquely different!
","Memento - what an amazingly different, unique film! Although every scene moves forward (to a certain point), the film itself is moving backwards, yet it all makes perfect sense as if the film is moving forward. Pure genius! Guy Pearce gives and incredibly convincing performance.",9,1,1,3 July 2018
Coraline," Good, but...
","When a child's parents doesn't pay enough attention to a child, they're bound to make up imaginary friends. These imaginary friends will also have a perfect world - escapism for the child, and a world he secretly longs for. This is the main premise of 'Coraline'.While there's much to love about the film - like the stunning animation - there's also some issues. What is the target audience? Children will love the animation and the cute little girl in the lead, and the cat (although the cat is a horrible looking thing!), but will they understand what the film is all about? Adults might understand the premise better, but will they relate to the characters as children would?This animated film has a very dark theme, with evil lurking around every corner. Some scenes might even give very young kids nightmares. Parts of the film reminded me of 'Pan's Labyrinth'. I must be honest, though, towards the end I found it difficult to understand what was actually going on. The film became very weird. After encountering ghosts of previous child victims, Coraline is given an adder stone - similar to 'Ouija' - to find their real eyes (now having buttons for eyes). Ghosts, witchery, evil spells, luring children - these are all themes not really suited for a young audience.'Coraline' certainly is magical and mystical, and the animation is beautiful. I'm just not sure this is entirely my cup of tea...",5,0,0,21 April 2020
Alien: Resurrection," Alien gets a unique vision thanks to great director!
","After the terrible 'Alien 3' and this being the 4th installment in a franchise, I wasn't very keen on watching this, but when I saw it was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I was very interested. This didn't seem like the fourth film. It felt fresh and new thanks to Jeunet's unique vision. We saw a very different side to the alien creatures, held captive for study and experimental purpose. I thoroughly enjoyed the experienced cast, and once all hell broke loose, it was exciting fast-paced non-stop action. The film's final moments does get a bit weird, but in general this was a very enjoyable entry to the franchise.",5,0,1,8 June 2018
Zootopia," Not my favorite animated film, but I enjoyed it.
","I love animation films. This is not exception. From the great animation to the good plot and storytelling, I loved this film. It sends a very strong message of not giving up on your dreams, and not to allow bullying to get you down.This was a great mystery adventure, with action and suspense. I enjoyed the characters, especially the jackal Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman). The film became more and more interesting as it progressed. Wow, this was actually rather exciting!",6,1,2,3 May 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Family friendly comedy horror with bite.
","I must be honest, I've never really been interested in seeing 'Shaun of the Dead', as trailers depicted the film as a slapstick comedy. (I detest slapstick comedies!!) I decided to watch this after seeing the Norwegian horror comedy 'Dead Snow 2' about zombies - a film I thoroughly enjoyed.'Shaun of the Dead' is so much better than expected, and is actually not slapstick. The humor is effective and really funny - some in a creepy way, but still funny. The make-up and visual effects are very good. This film is a family movie compared to 'Dead Snow 2', though. It is not as graphic or gory and the zombies are rather passive. Simon Pegg is excellent as a bit of a hopeless guy, who becomes the film's hero. The rest of the cast were also very good. Bill Nighy, off course, is brilliant in everything he does.The photography and editing are fantastic. The film is fast-paced and exciting from beginning to end. If you want a zombie film that doesn't feature too much guts and gore with good humor, then 'Shaun of the Dead' is the perfect choice.",6,0,0,6 October 2019
Argo," Brilliant action thriller.
","Compelling and suspenseful from beginning to end. An excellent cast, and great attention to detail. With a perfect blend of drama and humor, the film is entertaining and thrilling. Great climax and ending. All-round a wonderful production.",7,0,1,3 July 2018
Green Room," Well made and brutal.
","Due to some scenes being too dark and others ending too abruptly I wasn't always sure exactly what was happening. The film is nevertheless well done, so well in fact, that I found it difficult watching some of the scenes. Quite brutal at times.",6,2,4,3 July 2018
The Notebook," Overrated and insanely annoying, this was one of the most unromantic 'love stories' I've ever seen...
","Hailed as one of the great love stories, I finally decided to give it a go. Not even 20 minutes into the movie I was tempted to hit EJECT. I should have. The film became more and more annoying as it progressed. Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams)'s meeting was anything but romantic. Noah was the most forward, cocky, obnoxious, persistent character I've seen in a while. Oh, and I think the intention was for him to be charming...(??!!).The love birds were fighting all the time and they were the most incompatible lovers I've seen on screen. There were simply no chemistry between them. The falling in love set-up as well as the meeting of the family scenes were so similar to 'Titanic'. In fact, the film would eventually become nothing more than a 'Titanic' meets 'Pearl Harbor' film - only much, much more boring with nothing interesting happening except for the couple fighting all the time. Yawn.There was simply NOTHING romantic about their relationship. They did and said the most preposterous things! I mean, honestly! I also didn't find anything in the film justified. Everything simply happened for the sake of creating an epic, somber, tragic love story. I mean, did Noah honestly expect Allie to sit around waiting for him for years and years?? And how is it romantic when they have sex during a moment of lust while she is engaged to be married to another man whom she proclaims to love?This was the most unromantic, most annoying love story I've seen in a while. Credit where credit is due, though. The cinematography was really great. Joan Allen was very good as Allie's mom (although she was very similar to Maggie Smith as Rose's mom in 'Titanic'). Oh, and notice how Allie's ward in the Care Centre is called the Rose Ward!!Next! (I'd rather watch Titanic again...)",2,4,8,22 April 2019
The Babadook," More suspense than horror, it builds to a frightening tale!
","What starts of slow and a bit annoying soon turns to an eerie film of demonic possession, with very good (yet subtle) effects. Essie Davis is excellent as the mother.",7,0,0,3 July 2018
Us," What kind of crap is this...?
","Ok, so Jordan Peele directed 'Get Out', which caused quite a stir among critics. He is back with 'Us'. I remember not wanting to watch 'Get Out' but eventually decided to see it due to the media hype. It was better than expected, but nothing special.Again, due to the media hype and box office success, I decided to watch 'Us', a film I wasn't particularly interested in seeing. There are very few films I can't sit through until the end, even if they are bad. 'Us' is one of those rare films I simply couldn't handle any more, and finally hit the eject button.The film seriously suffers from lack of intelligent dialogue. In fact, the dialogue is incredibly standard - below standard even. And then there's annoying diaoluge like ' The first 35 minutes were incredibly boring. When things started going wrong, the film wasn't scary because the acting was so comedic. (Not sure whether this was the intention or whether the actors were just bad). Instead of sitting through the entire movie, I read up on the plot and how it would end. Boy, am I glad I decided not to watch this to the end. What crap!!! The media hype is completely beyond me ...",1,3,4,29 October 2019
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Not nearly as good as the original.
","The original cast is back for another adventure. Although this film was good enough in its own right, it was unfortunately not as memorable as its predecessor.The humor is not nearly as funny as the original, and more slapstick and cartoonish. There certainly is much to love about the film, but this installment is aimed at a younger demographic, with a very plain premise. The cute factor is gone, as well as the darker, deeper elements that made the first film so special and awesome. Some moments in the first film brought tears to my eyes, whereas this film never touched my senses in the same way.The animation is still good and most of the characters are still lovable (especially Scrat!), but it didn't have the mature elements, deeming it purely a kid's movie. 'Ice Age 2' now also incorporates the age old boring subject they so love in films: love. The first film was about survival, action adventure and an instinctive call to do good. All of that and more is absent from this film. There are a lot more unnecessary characters here for the sake of comic relief, and most of these characters are more annoying than funny, like a Mammoth thinking she's actually a Possum!!",5,1,1,25 August 2019
Oldboy," I don't get it; what's the hype all about?
","'Oldboy' is constantly mentioned as one of the greatest Korean films ever made, and has also been called the most disturbing Korean film (followed by 'I saw the Devil' and 'The Chaser', which were both incredibly disturbing). I therefore eagerly watched the film in high anticipation, but am quite sad to say I was very disappointed. It started off very interesting and mysterious, and the story was told in a very unique way. The moment Oh Dae Su is released, the film becomes very neo-noir-ish (and I don't enjoy neo-noir) and I actually found it to me more comedic than disturbing or suspenseful. Choi Min-sik was excellent, as usual, and without him in the lead I might have liked the film even less. So, essentially the film is about an old school friend, Lee Woo-jin, who wants to avenge Oh Dae-Su for Lee's sister's suicide. Because of this he locks him up for 15 years, then sets him free after 'programming' both him and his daughter via hypnosis to fall in love. Uhmm, ok... Ok, spoilers to follow, so stop reading if you don't want to know. Is this filmed said to be the most disturbing film simply because it is revealed the woman he so eagerly had sex with is actually his daughter? Nothing else in the film is disturbing. When all is said and done and Lee kills himself (what an anti-climax!!), Oh Dae-Su tracks down the hypnotist and asks her to erase his memory of his daughter so they can have a relationship. Seriously!!?? So he'd rather have her as his lover than his daughter?? I rest my case...",5,3,5,16 June 2018
Black Book," Simply stunning!
","Director Paul Verhoeven brought us a the blockbusters 'RoboCop', 'Total Recall', 'Basic Instinct', 'Starship Troopers' and 'Hollow Man'. 'Black Book' is a very different style for Verhoeven, and also not your average war movie. The film is essentially a drama set during the war, and chronicles the life of Rachel Stein (excellently portrayed by Carice van Houten).From being deceived to fighting back and becoming a leader in her own right, it is harrowing at times to see what Rachel has to go through. The film is shocking, disturbing and realistic. This is an epic, all-round incredible production with beautiful photography and cinematography. Carice is senstional!",8,0,0,23 April 2019
Finding Nemo," Just brilliant!!
","Finding Nemo did for clownfish what 'Lassie' did for the Collie. Since the release of the film, clownfish are now being referred to as Nemo, with kids exclaiming 'I found Nemo' when they see one. The film is as endearing as any animated film should be, with fantastic characters and a good plot. Dysfunctional Dory does steal the show, though, wonderfully voiced by Ellen Degeneres. Fantastic animation, cute humor and a few chills and thrills in the mix, as well. One of my all-time favorite animated films.",9,0,0,1 July 2018
Blade," Great action horror. Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast.
","Wesley Snipes is well-cast as the half-vampire, half-mortal, and deservedly won an award for favorite actor in a Horror movie. The visual effects are top-notch and the film has a solid premise. The action is exciting and fast-paced and the fight scenes (especially the final battle with Stephen Dorff) are excellent. Great photography and music, as well.",7,0,1,10 June 2018
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Awesome fantasy action adventure!
","Incredibly entertaining. From an action and visuals point of view, this is my second favorite in the series (my favorite still being 'X-Men 3: The Last Stand'). The visuals are simply impressive, to say the least. Liev Schreiber makes a fantastic, convincing antagonist. Great cast, great music and all-round great production. To call if fascinating is almost too mild a word.",7,2,3,2 July 2018
The Mummy," STILL one of the best action adventure films out there...
","'The Mummy' is another rare example of a film I can't really fault in any way. I have so much praise for this incredible production; this is a guilty pleasure to enjoy again and again.Action, adventure, drama, humor, suspense, horror and fantasy blended with incredible visual effects - honestly, what more could one ask for in a film. Even the humor is actually funny and not (entirely) slapstick. Everything about this film is just fantastic. Regarding the acting, I thought Rachel Weisz in particular was very good.This is a gem of a film I've watched so many times, and will again, and again, and again. Well done, director Stephen Sommers!!",7,0,0,17 March 2020
Rise of the Guardians," Awesome animated adventure.
","A cute story about keeping children's beliefs alive - belief in the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Sandman, and Jack Frost - as the Boogeyman tries to destroy their belief. Great animation and an overall positive theme ensure a feel-good movie that is probably best enjoyed around the Festive Season. This is one of my favorite animated films. I just love the kangaroo...uhm, bunny...",8,1,1,17 June 2018
Dead Poets Society," A film every parent should see!
","'Dead Poets Society' is one of the top rated films of all-time and also happens to be a multi-award winning film, and its easy to see why. This is a truly remarkable film every parent, especially, should see. Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard are exceptional in their respective roles. In fact, the entire cast were very good, and notably also Ethan Hawke.The love story between Knox and Chris felt forced and was annoying and seemingly out of place in this film. Yes, I understand the need to portray young love, since this is a coming of age film, but there was nothing romantic about them. I found it to be pure lust on Knox's behalf and Chris eventually fell for him for whatever reason. There is no chemistry whatsoever between them and the film would have been so much better without this love interest. Charlie Dalton's obsession with women was far more believable and (also) clearly lust, but suited the character and emphasized his personality.Robin Williams played a very gentle, kindhearted character, always giving advice and putting everyone else's needs before his own. He not only captures the student's attention, but also the viewer's, as he is perceived as a caring, loving person and me as the viewer felt a sense of joy as he nurtured the boys, giving them hope and inspiration - not only on a poetic level, but on life itself. It was delightful to see the boys enjoy his class and looking forward to what he had to offer.The unexpected ending shocked me to the core, for so many different reasons, and I won't spoil it for you. It caught me completely off guard. Although this is a film I probably won't watch again in a hurry (especially now that I know the ending) it definitely is a film worth viewing at least once.",8,2,2,6 December 2018
Orphan," Creepy start plummets to 'Are you serious'??!!
","The film started off very interesting and then turned rather creepy as the girl resorted to evil-doing, but as the film progressed, it seemed to loose its impact. Isabelle Fuhrman was excellent as the girl. I pretty much found this to be a female version of 'The Good Son' - only that was an excellent film. 'Orphan' looses direction towards the end, and I did not like the twist ending (spoiler alert) where it is discovered the girl is actually a 33-year old woman trapped in the form of a little girl due to an illness. This reveal is over-dramatized and this was where I lost interest, and it actually ruined the film for me.",5,2,3,16 June 2018
Aquaman," Well done, James Wan!!
","Wow, wow, wow! Trust horror director James Wan to take a superhero movie to an entirely different level. This was so different to the other superhero movies out there.Firstly, blood hell, the visuals are great. The fighting scenes are brutal and violent. Jason Momao is sensational as Aquaman. It simply wouldn't have been the same without him. He is very natural and does the character justice. I enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was also weak at times and vulnerable, and not a super god.'Aquaman' is visually stunning! Atlantis is portrayed as a bright, colorful, breathtakingly beautiful place. The costumes are incredible, and cleverly incorporates marine elements. The photography is also amazing, and I absolutely loved the score. I enjoyed the inclusion of the Roy Orbison song 'Mystery Girl' in such a modern film.The film is unpredictable and sometimes action abruptly ends tranquil moments. Unlike most Marvel films, the humor was at the right moments, appropriate and actually funny. For some reason I honestly believed I wouldn't enjoy 'Aquaman', believing it to be just another superhero 'been there done that' movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. I absolutely LOVED it. I loved the characters. I loved the story. I loved the entire production. This was awesome!",8,2,6,11 June 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," Much too simple! Definitely a kid's movie. Slow and pointless (for adults).
","This critically acclaimed, multi-award winning, hugely successful film is regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. Unfortunately, I don't share their enthusiasm.'My Neighbor Totoro' has a very simple premise. So simple, in fact, that I don't understand the reason behind the film. The film played like a pointless, overlong cartoon, which did absolutely nothing for my senses. I generally enjoy anime films, but this is definitely aimed at a younger demographic. I did not get - or maybe not understood - the deeper meaning of the film. It is a very slow film with not much happening - not that matters, anyway. The film also suffers from a number of inconsistencies.",3,2,16,15 December 2019
The Day After Tomorrow," Entertaining enough to keep me satisfied.
","Over the years we've certainly seen our share of natural disaster movies - some excellent (think 'Armageddon', 'Dante's Peak', 'Twister'), some excruciatingly bad (think '2012' and 'GeoStorm'). 'The Day after Tomorrow' falls in the good category - not excellent, not bad, and certainly better than bad.The characters are cliched. The storms and disasters are bigger than realistically possible, and sensational. The events are highly improbable. And there's that darn obligatory Hollywood love interest - why, just why must it be in almost every movie? There's no place for a newfound love story in this movie. If you want to add romance, have it between a couple that's been married or going out for some time. Not the 'oh, I just realized I'm in love' scenario...pfff!Off course there are the usual credibility issues. People make it out of situations that's just impossible for them to do so. I guess sensationalism outweighs reality in Hollywood. The film even gets over-sentimental at times. Despite this, though, 'The Day after Tomorrow' is an exciting adventure thriller. It poses the 'what if' scenario and I suppose one shouldn't take it too seriously or try to analyze the facts. This is for entertainment purpose only, and in that regard it succeeds. The visual effects are good and the disaster scenes are very well made. Watch it for what it is and you will be entertained. I enjoyed it.",6,0,1,22 April 2020
X-Men," Incredible!
","Very classy sci-fi fantasy with an exceptional cast, good music and all-round fantastic production. Very entertaining indeed!",7,1,1,2 July 2018
Children of Heaven," Excellent in its simplicity
","'Children of Heaven' is a film about shoes. Yup, shoes! The film has such a simple premise, but it is so well done and touches on various humanitarian aspects within this simple story.The film is about the consequences of a boy losing his sister's shoes - how it affects the children, and that will ultimately also lead to self-discovery. The acting is so natural that the story is believable in its entirety. Mohammad Amir Naji plays a father who tries everything is his power to support his family, while his wife is sick and unable to work. They are poor and can just barely keep their head above water, and there is no money to buy new shoes. The child actors are so brilliant, it really is a shame none of them pursued acting.",7,0,0,6 October 2019
Sleepy Hollow," Another masterpiece by Tim Burton
","The legendary fairy tale comes to life in the hands of visionary director Tim Burton, and the result is nothing short of a masterpiece.Johnny Depp is well cast as Ichabod Crane, the film's unwilling hero, in a toned down performance by the superstar. 'Sleepy Hollow' is visually stunning and atmospheric. The film features some seriously creepy moments, enhanced by excellent photography.The humor is subtle and effective, and so well performed by Depp. Humor, horror, action and fantasy blend to perfection in this mystery horror thriller. The film became more intriguing - and more horrific - as it progressed. There's literally never a dull moment here. Great acting by a veteran cast and a compelling script ensure credibility. Danny Elfman's score compliments the film.The finale has a few surprises in store with a great climax. 'Sleepy Hollow' is an all-round fantastic production!",7,0,0,24 May 2020
Ready Player One," An acquired taste.
","Few people are aware of the fact Steven Spielberg is also a video game creator. 'Ready Player One' brings us closer to that fact, with the film's premise revolving around a game, and the film's visuals looking like a video game.People not into gaming - or computers for that matter - might have a difficult time understanding or appreciating the film. This is an acquired taste, and will not appeal to the mainstream audience. The animation is fantastic. I loved the soundtrack. I enjoyed the fact that they used old music for a futuristic movie. And I loved the characters and plot. It literally feels as if you're inside a PlayStation experiencing the game. The reference to 'The Shining' - and the incorporation thereof into the film - was really cool. Being a game, though, much of the film was perceived not to be taken seriously, because 'it's only a game'. It only really became more serious towards the end, when their lives were in danger, but even then did it have that Disney family movie feel to it.'Ready Player One' is an interesting look at what the future might hold for us - and it's a rather daunting thought!",5,0,1,10 March 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," Oh, so enjoyable!!
","Now, who doesn't enjoy Tintin? Or a great action adventure? 'The Adentures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' has it all: action, adventure, humor, drama, fantasy, and solid storytelling.Ok, so this is what I refer to as cheat animation, since it is not entirely animation. Real actors were used, and a lot of the scenes were actually performed by these actors. So its not just an animated film with voice over work. The result, however, is incredible. 'The Adventures of Tintin' is visually stunning and the characters are life-like (needless to say). Interestingly enough, Tintin wasn't my favorite character here. Captain Haddock was. He was the most interesting character with the most fascinating back story. He was humorous and all-round likable.The film cleverly combines fantasy elements in this action adventure. There's a lot of slapstick humor and although I generally don't like slapstick, I didn't mind it much here. Off course, also keeping in mind - being animated - it would be aimed at a young demographic, although off course to be equally enjoyed by adults. The pirate battles were incredibly well done.'The Adventures of Tintin' is an all-round top notch production, with a captivating story, compelling characters, beautiful animation and excellent voice-over work. This is a film to enjoy again and again.",7,0,0,20 May 2020
Moana," Forgettable yawner...
","Yawn. Oh, its over. Review time. Uhmm.....uhm.....Since the success of 'Frozen', there's a desire to make every animated film a musical, or at least with a few musical numbers. Unfortunately this film offers noting new and the singing is more annoying than entertaining. This film feels like it is trying to be 'Frozen', 'The Lion King', 'The Croods', 'Tangled', 'Minions' and 'Tinker Bell' (and several other animated films) all in one. The characters, however, are very bland and the plot as thin as the icing layer on a cake.There is nothing special about Moana and none of the other characters are even remotely interesting. The film lacks depth and the animation lacks detail. This is a forgettable film I'll conveniently forget I've ever watched. Oh, and did they intend Maui to look like Hurley from the 'Lost' series??Yawn.",2,3,6,24 December 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," You simply HAVE to see this!!
","Amazing visual effects makes this one of the best foreign language films I've ever seen, and quite frankly one of my favorite films of all time. The interesting plot comes wonderfully to life with fascinating visuals and good acting, notably Sergi Lopez as the antagonist. This is simply brilliance on every level!!",10,2,3,2 July 2018
Final Destination 2," Watch it out of curiosity only...
","Ok, so now we're already familiar with the story and know what to expect. Unfortunately, this film offers nothing new to the plot. Instead, it plays like a remake of 'Final Destination'. So much so that there really was no need for this film, and it therefore serves to please those who haven't seen the first film.The film actually follows on 'Final Destination'. Ali Larter reprises her role of Clear Rivers (seriously, that's the character's name!!). Hardly 20 minutes into the film, though, there are so many plot flaws. I must admit, the highway crash sequence was incredible. But why did the random drivers at the scene also go to the police station? Why were they involved? And why are only a handful involved then, and not everyone Kimberley blocked? They should have made it clearer that these people would have died in the crash had she not blocked them off. It would have made a lot more sense if her friends were involved. It's therefore not as good - or effective - a setup as the first film.Whereas the first film was rather serious, here they added humor. There honestly is some humor - and dialogue - that doesn't belong. It completely ruined the film's potential suspense. Quite a number of scenes were unnecessarily comical.The first victim dies much too soon after the incident - before we even got to know him. The killings are more brutal and more far-fetched than the first film, although it can essentially still happen in real life.The acting was unfortunately nothing to write home about. The make-up effects were very good, though. As for the film in general: forgettable.Would I watch it again? No.",3,0,0,24 April 2020
Blade II," Superb action and horror.
","For the best in action and horror, you probably can't go wrong with 'Blade 2'. The action is relentless and non-stop from beginning to end. The film features incredible photography from interesting angles and the visual effects are incredible, to say the least. Wesley Snipes is once again in top form. The creature effects are cringe-worthy - it is just so well done! Being Guillermo del Toro, though, I suppose great visuals were inevitable. The man is a so visionary!I did detest the Hollywood annoying fight to the death first encounter and then working together cliche. They justified it with the silly line 'You people shot first.' Seriously!!?? This dreadful scene aside (although the imagery during the scene was incredible!), the film was simply spectacular on an action and horror level.",6,0,1,10 June 2018
Alien," STILL one of the best films in the genre.
","'Alien' has to be one of the most remarkable alien films ever made - if not the most. Every film of this genre since 1979 was bound to be compared to 'Alien' (just like every shark film since 'Jaws' is being compared to that masterpiece).The character introductions are so good - and natural - it's been copied in numerous movies since, but never as believable. Here you have seven astronauts who's been together for a while, and that comes across very effectively. The crew members are working together without annoying feuds between them - which became so cliched in later films, and we immediately get a sense of professionalism. I buy every single character, and the casting is also perfect. There are no comic relief characters, and in fact, only the required amount of characters. There are no characters 'just for the kill'.In a sense, I suppose once could view this as a pre-80s slasher film, but certainly with a lot more substance. 'Alien' has an awesome production design, with spectacular sets. The creature effects are also incredibly realistic. This film still looks so good it's hard to believe it was made over four decades ago. It certainly stood the test of time! 'Alien' revolutionized the sci-fi genre.'Alien' is just perfect on every level. The acting is very believable. The suspense is nail-biting. The action is fantastic. The premise is solid and the script great.",8,0,0,20 April 2020
The Polar Express," Christmas won't be the same without The Polar Express.
","'The Polar Express' is listed in the Guinness Book of Records for being the first all-digital capture film. The animation is awesome, but admittedly due to live action motion capture animation, so not entirely animated. I enjoy watching this film every year around Christmas time, as this is a real feel-good, high-spirited film. I love the characters and the storyline, and there are indeed a number of lessons to be learnt here. For most grown-ups, I suppose, the Christmas bell does not ring around Christmas time anymore, as before.",6,2,2,17 June 2018
Life of Pi," Spectacularly filmed, but over-rated with way too many plot flaws.
","This highly acclaimed, multi award winning film was also a huge box office success, earning $609 million on a $120 million budget. Unfortunately I was not as impressed. The visuals and effects are indeed impeccable, but that's as much as I enjoyed about the film. The fact that Pi was telling the story and the actual story were flashbacks, removed every inch of suspense, as I knew nothing was going to happen to him. Why they chose to do it that way is beyond me. It also suffered from way too many plot flaws and was anything but credible. You honestly want me to believe the tiger was under the canvas of the raft for more than a day without making an appearance or even a sound?? And what was the purpose of the weird meerkat island? Nothing their made any sense and did not contribute to the story whatsoever, apart from adding to the already long running time. When Pi finally got to shore, the tiger just ran off!! I was expecting so much more, as Pi tried gaining the tiger's trust all along, and it seemed to work, until they reached the shore. Idiotic tiger! At the end, you still don't know if everything he told actually happened or whether it was just a figment of his imagination. I'll go with the latter.",4,1,2,18 June 2018
Tangled," An instant favorite!!
","In how many ways and with how many adjectives can I describe how much I enjoyed 'Tangled'?! Oh, my goodness, I absolutely loved it!The animation is stunning. The voicing was very good. It has an awesome story and a unique retelling of a classic tale. The film also had a very bright and colorful look, enhancing the feel-good vibe. The floating lanterns scene was simply awesome and mesmerizing, actually. Absolutely beautiful!I enjoyed every single character in the film. I felt the king and queen's sadness, still looking for their lost child years after she was kidnapped. There were some sincere, emotional moments. The horse, Maximus, was my favorite character, and I simply adored the chameleon, too! I want a horse like Maximus! I literally loved every minute of this film.The original songs were incredible, with clever, appropriate lyrics. 'Skip the drama, stay with Mama.' Ha-ha, so funny!! The only issue with the film was the inconsistency of the length of Rapunzel's hair, but I'll forgive them for the sake of convenience for the character to move about more easily. This is a feel-good movie of note. Spectacular!",10,3,3,24 May 2019
Doctor Strange," I didn't like it one bit.
","So, I watched 'Doctor Strange' in great anticipation because I've become a Benedict Cumberbatch fan, and due to they hype surrounding the film. Hmf, this is my review: 'Oh, so American!! CGI on steroids. The visual effects are very Inception-ish, only in Inception it was more realistic and made sense, and Inception had a good story. This is just blue-screen Deluxe and totally unbelievable. Even Benedict Cumberbatch can't save this one for me.' The film was interesting for the first, say, twenty minutes, but I completely lost interest the moment of Dr Stephen Strange's car crash. From there it just became...strange, and anything but believable due to a very poor plot.",3,1,4,3 July 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Great cast, great story.
","Frances McDormand is EXCELLENT! Acting from the entire cast was superb and the script is awesome (pity about all the unnecessary foul language, though). Considering the theme, there is actually so much sadness behind all the humor. Writer/director Martin McDonagh found a brilliant way of not making a very sad story depressing. The drama and humor blends so seamlessly, its quite magnificent actually. The film in its entirety is a masterpiece. It does kinda leave you hanging in the end, but it is truly fantastic.",7,2,3,13 June 2018
Corpse Bride," Animated masterpiece!
","Marvelous! Brilliant animation. Hilarious, sad, happy - a montage of emotion wrapped in animation. 'The Corpse Bride' is my all-time favorite animated film. I just love the premise and the execution thereof. I loved the musical element, and the depiction of the word of the dead as colorful and vibrant, while the world of the living was grey and somber. Absolutely fantastic!! Best viewed on Blu Ray.",10,0,0,28 June 2018
Forrest Gump," Well made, but overlong and ultimately boring.
","This was an interesting trip through the eyes of an idiot, as he is referred to by most in the film. I loved the music during the particular events, as well. Yes, this was an excellent film and yes, Tom Hanks is brilliant. The film is ultimately a talkie, though, and I'm not into talkies. I also found the film overlong with possibly too much information crammed into it. The visual effects were very good, especially the war scenes. The film does teach us a few lessons, e.g. never to judge a person by appearance, and never going back on promises made, and probably also not to give up on your dreams.",6,1,1,13 June 2018
"Monsters, Inc."," Awesome animation film with great underlying theme.
","This is a really great movie premise, and very well executed. One can't help but fall in love with the characters, and thankfully the voicing was perfect. The animation was amazing and this is a film that will appeal to a young and mature demographic. The Monsters Inc corporation itself was an amazing undertaking and very well laid out. This is one of my favorite animation films.",7,0,0,5 June 2018
Incendies," One word: INCREDIBLE!
","Initially, the film can be a bit confusing due to them continually jumping back in time. Once you get the hang of it, though, and get to know the characters, it is easy enough to follow.This is essentially two films in one: the story of a mother searching for the son she had to give up at birth, and a story about twins searching for their father, and a brother they never knew they had. The film takes us on an incredible journey filled with action, suspense, drama, and more than just a few twists.'Incendies' effectively illustrates the horrors of war, and killings in the name of religion. What an absolutely fantastic script. This is one of the most amazing films I've seen in a while.",8,1,1,16 November 2019
Fargo," Thriller??? This is an annoying slapstick comedy! I HATED it!!
","In the opening, it states the film is based on a true story. Having done research on the film, it turns out is is not. This is completely fictional, and a very annoying film at that. Categorized as a crime thriller also made me raise an eyebrow. This is nothing more than a slapstick comedy with a bit of drama here and there - with no thrills or chills whatsoever. The acting from the veteran cast was over the top and annoying to the point where I could hardly watch another second.The film also has the strangest dialogue considering the circumstances, and all the characters act like complete idiots. Their accents are also inconsistent. I was so bored and irritated with this stupid film! The film is only 98 minutes long, and about 15 minutes are spent on a Chinese friend of Detective Gunderson (McDormand) phoning her out of the blue and coming to visit. He has nothing to do with the story, and in a whiff he is gone again without adding ANYTHING to the film. ???The mind boggles...????Why this film is so highly acclaimed is completely beyond comprehension. I hated it!!!",1,0,7,21 October 2019
Predator," A true action horror classic!
","'Predator' is a true classic in the action horror genre, and in my opinion one of Schwarzenegger's best films. The film is engaging from the opening, and once they enter the forest, it is foreboding and unpredictable. There truly never is a dull moment. Schwarzenegger is really great in this film and embodies what an action hero is all about. Bill Duke also gave a standout performance.The visual effects are very good and the action is top notch. The score by Alan Silvestri significantly adds to the suspense, and really drives the movie. This is an awesome action adventure horror I'll watch again and again.",8,3,3,12 May 2019
Nightcrawler," Well made film, but not for everyone!
","This is not an ideal movie for escapism and certainly not a family movie. It plunges you into the deep end of the world of peril and tragedy - without being violent or brutal. The film is so realistically done that some scenes are difficult to watch due to the tragic (realistic) nature of them.This is an interesting insight into how footage for newscasts is obtained - sometimes so easily overlooked. It's also a sad fact that a price tag is determined by the level and scale of a tragedy. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic. He has a constant eeriness about him. There's such a strong resemblance here to Joaquin Phoenix' performance in 'Joker'. The film is creepy and disturbing in so many ways, and in many instances it has nothing to do with what is directly displayed on screen.The film has a stunning, nail biting climax. Although a very good film, I probably won't be watching it again due to the nature of the film.https://paulsmoviereviews",6,0,0,12 March 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," Sensational!!
","It's only fitting to name the film after one of the greatest songs ever written. You don't have to be a fan of Queen's music to enjoy the film, though.Rami Mallek is sensational as Freddie Mercury. He really does Freddie justice. A lot of people out there might not like Queen after this film, and on the other hand they'll gain a lot more fans. Either way, this is definitely a film some will praise, and some would wish they'd never seen. As for me, I absolutely loved it! From the acting to the directing to the attention to detail, this is an incredible production.I particularly enjoyed the Live Aid scenes. So much effort went into recreating the event, it is incredibly realistic. Simply awesome! I would have preferred Jim Hutton, Freddie's lover, to feature more prominently in the film. Nevertheless, this was stunning. We know the music. We didn't quite know the story. Now we see both in harmony.",9,0,1,22 April 2019
Bird Box," Way too many plot holes.
","Ah, yes, someone was bound to try and cash in on the success of 'A Quiet Place' with a similar-themed film. There's no way one can watch this and not compare it with 'A Quiet Place'. Only, its not as well executed.Despite previous serious roles, I still consider Sandra Bullock to be more of a comedy star, so casting her in this film was an interesting (if not odd) choice. I must admit, though, she did pull it off pretty well and I might just (finally) see a different side to her. There's just so many plot holes here that the film is not as believable as 'A Quiet Place'. Ok, so the creatures make people suicidal, but for what purpose? Annihilation? Are they aliens? The corpses are being left to rot, so why would the creatures kill them? Or could this indeed be biological warfare? Why do some people find what they see 'beautiful' while others commit suicide? What's the difference here? Why do the ones who find it 'beautiful' and becoming sort of a cult group, want others to 'see' it as well? What is their ultimate gain?The film leaves me with way too many questions and ultimately feels like a blend of 'A Quiet Place' meets '28 Weeks Later', only nothing here is justified or even remotely credible. Some great visuals, though, and a few nice scary moments.",4,2,4,6 January 2019
American Pie," Unfunny!!
","There's a reason why I don't watch comedies. This is another perfect example. Hailed as one of the greatest comedies ever made (yes, box office proofs it) I must be one of the few to not enjoy this - at all! This was just CHEESY in bold capital letters. There was literally nothing I enjoyed about this raunchy comedy. I didn't mind it at all being raunchy (in fact that made it more tolerable), but it was just not funny.Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) was a complete idiot and and the over-acting on Seann William Scott's behalf as Steve Stifler was so theatrical and annoying. The whole set-up with Stifler's mom was also just silly and not believable. I couldn't wait for them to all have sex so the film could end. Maybe I truly am a grump who can't relate to comedies...",2,0,7,25 September 2018
The Killing Fields," Well made drama.
","Director Roland Joffe did an incredible job in capturing the very essence of what friendship means. 'The Killing Fields' is a moving drama that sends out a strong message of friendship and loyalty.The shocking reality of war is so well depicted here. The film is just as unpredictable as life itself. The actors did a very good job in bringing the characters to life, especially Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran. (Ngor himself, was a captive during the Cambodian war where he was imprisoned and tortured).Parts of the film looks like an advertising vessel for Coca Cola, which is a pity, but I suppose they were a big sponsor. Apart from that, this is a very well done film. I did find the latter part of the second act and into the beginning of the third act a bit dragged out. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't in the least boring, but found it too long. It does span a few years, though, so I suppose they wanted to show us the agony Dith Pran had to endure, making way for a good finale.",6,0,0,12 April 2020
Baby Driver," Good, but nothing special.
","The chemistry between Ansel Elgort and Lily James is really great. Ansel is perfectly cast as Baby, and Kevin Spacey was excellent as per usual. A premise that's been done a zillion times before is taken to another level thanks to the movie being shot with incredible flair, and great dialogue. The action scenes were nothing to write home about compared to today's action films, but they were simple and effective and above all very realistic. As with most gangs, their plans go haywire towards the end as they all fall apart, and this was wonderfully done. There were no silly, slapstick humor which normally accompanies films of this genre and that was refreshing.",5,1,1,20 June 2018
Justice League," CGI overload kills the reality.
","'Justice League' follows directly on 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', so I suggest watching that first.'Justice League' is an incredible display of CGI. The film plays like a live action cartoon and some of the action scenes are incredible with amazing visuals.The film is about antagonist Steppenwolf sourcing three boxes scattered around the globe, that will give him absolute power. This might seem very cliched, and yes, it is. Steppenwolf itself is entirely a CGI creation. Blending CGI with reality is easy nowadays. Making it realistic is an entirely different matter. Although they did a great job with 'Justice League', the CGI overload renders most of the film completely unbelievable. There really is not an inch of reality during the action scenes. It is maybe a bit too fantastical an unrealistic.Just like Marvel's 'The Avengers' there are too many protagonists for one film, resulting in some of them having limited screen time. Superman, for example, doesn't show up until past the halfway mark. Batman carries the film, but then, this is not a Batman film. I therefore have mixed feelings about the film. If you're in the mood for action overload with CGI effects galore, then this is the perfect choice. If you're looking for something more substantial, well then, this might not be the wisest choice.Would I watch it again? Not sure.https://paulsmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2020/02/09/justice-league-2017/",5,0,3,9 February 2020
28 Weeks Later," Suspenseful sequel.
","The first thing I noticed was the good acting. After a great opening scene, the film is a roller coaster ride of fun and excitement, with wonderful action sequences and awesome visuals. I actually enjoyed this sequel more than the original. The plot has more depth, and is more suspenseful, as well. The scene where a helicopter dives into a swarm of zombies was awesome!! Jeremy Renner is a likable hero, as usual, and the rest of the cast was equally good and likable. The zombie make-up was quite frightening, actually. The film has a fantastic score, as well. This was an incredible thrill-ride. Bloody fantastic, I say!",6,0,0,5 June 2018
The Thing," A classic!!
","Much better than expected! The visual effects are amazing and quite frightening, actually! The plot is not that great, but still entertaining and the suspense is nail-biting. This is a true horror classic.",7,1,3,1 July 2018
21," A really great film.
","Excellent film about an ordinary guy with a gift for reading cards. The film is beautifully filmed with a great soundtrack. I don't play Blackjack but nevertheless found the film very appealing and a pleasure to watch. Kevin Spacey is great as usual, and Jim Sturgess is very good as Ben, with the gift for reading cards. The acting is believable, although I must admit some of the other characters did not have strong personalities and seemed redundant at times. I loved the fantastic twist ending. All and all, this was a great film!",6,0,0,21 June 2018
Split," James McAvoy was brilliant, but so many plot flaws!!
","'Split' was shot on a budget of only $9million, and earned $277million at the box office, so - needless to say - I highly anticipated watching this film. Although the film is relatively slow moving, it was nevertheless very interesting. A few flaws, though: how could no-one witness the abduction in a busy parking lot? (Not even the girls themselves noticed at first!?!?). We know he had mental disorders, but what was the motive for the abduction? Why did he spent so much time and effort in securing the victims' environment if he had no plans for them? I understand he had multiple personalities, but it was just impossible for him to also change outfits so quickly when another personality took over. Spoiler alert!: why were the victims killed off-screen? I rooted for them, for goodness sake, but we don't even know what really happened to them. What does the ending mean? What was the whole purpose? I have to give the story a 5/10, but 10/10 to James McAvoy as the antagonist. He is simply BRILLIANT, and in my opinion carried the movie!!",4,0,1,3 July 2018
Knowing," The very last Nicolas Cage film I really enjoyed
","The opening scene was enough to wet my appetite for the rest of the film. I found the film interesting and mysterious. It was a sort of a 'Left Behind' type film, only in a slightly different direction and more realistic, I think. This was the time when Nicolas Cage still made good films and when I was still interested in seeing his films. (Can't remember when the list Cage film was I enjoyed. In fact, this was the last one!). Having directed one of my all-time favorite films 'The Crow', Alex Proyas does not disappoint with this film. I really liked his approach to the disaster scenes, making them brutally realistic. The plane and train scenes are incredible! They are fast-paced, no holds-barred scenes just the way it probably would happen in real life. There was so much going on during these scenes that you'd miss something if you blinked. The film also has some very good visuals, and even a few scary moments. I did find the music a bit loud and overbearing at times. Also, the film shows John (Nicolas Cage) deciphering the code in just one night - while intoxicated, I might add. Although he is a professor, it is still physically and mentally impossible. Despite that, though, this was an enjoyable action packed thriller drama with a satisfying ending.",7,1,2,26 September 2018
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Incredible action.
","Impressive visuals! The actions scenes are really incredible and all-out spectacular. The (sometimes silly) humor was actually quite funny, too, especially with Arnold's very dry sense of humor that comes across so hilarious. Just like the previous films, this is non-stop action and excitement from beginning to end. Loken was fantastic as the antagonist. Yes, the film does feature the 'destroy-as-much-as-possible' action sequences Hollywood action films are known for, but it does actually work well in these films.",6,2,2,11 June 2018
The Orphanage," Awesome suspense with great twist.
","Another wonderful movie from Guillermo Del Toro. Wonderfully eerie and mysterious throughout with subtle music, and a great cast. Oh wow, what a shocking twist ending!",7,1,3,2 July 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Beyond boring, and VERY annoying.
","Interestingly enough I wasn't expecting much from the film, despite very positive reviews from critics. There was very little about the film I enjoyed, actually, except for Bradley Cooper's good looks. This was a freaked out, messed up film! These characters have so many issues, were I actually supposed to root for any of them? I couldn't care less about any of them - especially Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who was just downright annoying. Man, I absolutely HATED this character!!I know this was (probably) supposed to be a romantic film, but I didn't feel it. I literally couldn't wait for this to end, as I found it beyond boring. Is this the non-exciting, non-interesting, non-funny, non-romantic, non-ANYTHING, very annoying version of 'Shall we dance'?? I suppose this is what one would call a chick flick, coz it did absolutely nothing for me as a man. It didn't stir any of my senses, apart from wanting to hit the stop/eject button about a thousand times!",1,2,7,11 July 2018
Divergent," Yawn, yawn, and another yawn.
","The worldwide phenomenon had me hitting the forward button and heaving a sigh of relief when the credits rolled. More than an hour into the movie there were still boring tests and character introductions and I was still wondering where the movie was supposed to be going. Once is enough, thanks...more than enough.",2,2,4,5 July 2018
Dunkirk," Well made, but I was still disappointed.
","Hailed by critics as one of the best war films ever made, I must admit I once again disagree with them, as seems to be the norm. At times the characters are just too darn quiet, so much so that I wanted to urge them to just say something or make a sound or anything! Other times the music made it more interesting that what it really was. It was not very exciting nor very interesting. It wasn't suspenseful. Also, more often than not I got a sense of deja vu. It felt the action was going in repeat mode. It is essentially three stories: A small rescue yacht on its way to Dunkirk. Rescue aircraft on their way to Dunkirk. And soldiers at Dunkirk waiting to evacuate. None of the characters had very significant roles, in my opinion at least. I thought Mr Dawson (Mark Rylance) was the most distinct character of all, and seemed the most sensible, as well.Having said that, though, there can be no denying the film is very well made.",6,0,0,17 June 2018
The Intouchables," Beautiful and touching.
","'The Intouchables' is an inspiring and uplifting story of an unlikely friendship. The lead actors (Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy) are excellent in their respective roles.Despite a troublesome background, Driss (Omar Sy) only sees the good in everyone and wants everybody to do good. His presence has a positive effect on those around him and becomes more than just the quadriplegic's right hand. This is a touching and engaging film of true friendship, and sends out a wonderful, positive message. Beautiful.",7,0,1,14 November 2019
Ratatouille," Oh, this was SO awesome!!
","Although the idea of rats preparing food in a restaurant is anything less than appealing, this was a delightful, entertaining movie! 'Ratatouille' is just bursting with flavor! Whisk together stunning animation, a fantastic plot, great characters, and blend in humor, drama, action and adventure and you have a recipe for success! I enjoyed every moment. This is one of my favorite animated films, actually.",10,1,1,2 July 2018
Now You See Me," Thrilling!
","An all-star cast with good acting, good story, good editing, great dialogue and all-round excitement, this is a top notch production. I loved the vibrant music, as well. There are interesting reveals of some magic tricks. Some of the explanations might leave you raising an eyebrow or two thinking 'that's not possible, but its still cool, though!'.There's so much here to take into account that the film deserves a few viewings. Having seen it and pondering about the twist ending, I watched it again. Not everything makes entirely sense once you know the outcome and more than just a few questions comes to mind, but this is such an exciting film with great fast-paced action scenes that these can easily be overlooked. The ending is just so stunningly well done.",7,0,1,27 September 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Yet another great entry in the series
","The X-Men series consistently delivers style and substance you don't generally find with fantasy films. I enjoyed the different characters, and the actors - as usual in these films - are very good. Although the film is a sequel to 'First Class', it starts in the future, and then goes back in time to follow on 'First Class', and then simultaneously plays in the past and future, so it can be a bit confusing. But - in typical X-Men style - they handle it so well that everything makes perfect sense.The visuals are insane! This prequel series is not as action-packed as the original trilogy, but it is captivating and a pleasure to watch. It's actually amazing how they made this fit into the series, with incredible attention to detail and taking all previous films into consideration. Stunning!",7,0,0,20 March 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Blah blah blah...just why??? What the hell...??
","I'm so confused. Why is this part of the Captain America franchise and not 'The Avengers 3: Civil War'? I mean, all the Avengers are here (except for Hulk and Thor) and it follows on 'The Avengers: Age of Ultron'. After all, the first two Captain America films only featured Captain America as super-hero.Ok, so this film was about...uhm...well... about.... what the heck was it about again?? Apart from the Avengers fighting among themselves there really wasn't much else going on in this film! (Hence the title Civil War, off course.) The fact that the film earned more than $1 billion dollars is completely beyond me. So, the audience actually enjoy seeing the Avengers fighting among themselves??? What a weird society we live in...Let's face it, the opening scene was very good, and the Bucky chase scene was absolutely incredible. It was fast-paced, exciting and the great photography made the viewer feel he was actually part of the action. After that the film mainly revolves around conflict between the Avengers. I actually enjoyed Tony Stark in this film, who was the most sensible character. The film was dramatic until the halfway mark when Spider-Man and Ant-Man showed up, and along came the silly humor that didn't belong. Why were they in the film at all? They only had a few minutes screen time each and could easily have been replaced by some of the other characters. There were absolutely no need for them.The fight scene at the airport was completely over the top and actually became rather silly, almost amateurish. It felt like I was watching a visualization of a child's imagination whilst playing with his toys. It honestly was cringe worthy.There really was no need for this film...",3,2,6,15 June 2019
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Visually great, but what was it about actually??
","Despite the big hype and the film's huge commercial success, I did not enjoy it one bit. It is cartoonish silly at times without an ounce of realism. Just like JK Rowling's Harry Potter series I couldn't be bothered with anything about this movie. It's just not convincing. The visual effects are indeed incredible, but that's just it; the film is all about effects...I still don't know what the film is really about. The story was just not interesting enough to justify me sitting through this for over two hours. It was like watching a documentary on what can be accomplished with effects. Nothing else.",4,1,1,28 June 2018
Spirited Away," Wonderful feel-good film
","Hailed as one of the best films ever made and winning several awards I must be honest I expected more. I fondly remember 'Grave of the Fireflies', which - in my opinion - is still one of the most awesome animated films ever made. I somehow expected this film to give me the same blissful sensation, but it didn't. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it; I did, and it is a wonderful film. I did feel, however, this film was aimed at a younger demographic.The film effectively portrays the naive and innocent nature of children, and how they would always see the good in everything and try to do good in return. No pretense. I must also admit to enjoying this style of animation, which Japan is so well-known for. In general, this was a feel-good movie with a great underlying theme.",7,0,1,29 August 2018
The Conjuring 2," Not as good as the original, but still good.
","As with most sequels, this was not as scary or effective as 'The Conjuring'. It was nice to see Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga back in the roles of Ed and Lorraine Warren. They just bring such a sense of credibility to the film that you almost believe they are Ed and Lorraine Warren. I did get a sense of 'Oh, I've seen this before', but the film is nevertheless still good in its own right and worth the watch.",6,1,2,1 July 2018
Inside Out," An instant favorite!
","Well now, I just adore this film! This is one of my favorite animated films. It touches on so many elements and emotions one can relate to, its a modern masterpiece. The story is fantastic. I mean, what an ingenious idea! If I can summarize the film in one word, it would be AWESOME!I loved everything about this film. The animation was great, the characters were original, the script was sensational. I loved the idea of the Islands of Personality, and the Dream Productions. The film makes one remember fragments from one's own life, long forgotten, and rekindle those wonderful memories. It really makes you dig deep into your memories. Interestingly enough, it also shows the importance of being sad sometimes. Loved this!!",10,3,7,26 September 2018
Quantum of Solace," Another boring 007 film with plot flaws galore.
","The opening chase scene was impressive. The action scenes are incredibly fast-paced and very well done. That's about as much as I liked the film. Let's face it: I'm not a James Bond fan for obvious reasons - nothing in these films are realistic. Almost all the scenes are for effect only and either completely unrealistic or completely stupid. Off course there's the favorite cliched running on the roofs scenes, as well as the running through the kitchen scene, and naturally - being American - the destroy as much as possible scenes. The Bond plots are always way too confusing for my puny little mind, also Bond's ability to know foreign places inside and out. Everything is just too easy for Bond, and the way he dodges bullets is just not believable. It's quite boring, actually. How is it that his insane ideas and plans always work?? The ending was spectacular (for a moment) but then overdone by effects. Daniel Craig does make a good Bond, though. Mathieu Amalric was not convincing as the villain.",4,1,3,18 June 2018
Independence Day," Entertaining despite bucket loads of plot flaws and credibility issues.
","When reviewing a film, I always try not to comment on religious or political views, and judge it on an entertainment and credibility level, regardless of whether it is a drama or fantasy. Although this fantasy drama mentioned at one point in the film Independence Day would be a world celebration if they stand together and eliminate the enemy, I couldn't help but feel this film was viewed entirely from an American perspective. I did not agree with the choice of actors for some of the characters, especially Bill Pullman as the President. I'm not sure whether the President himself was not a very strong, believable character, or whether Bill Pullman was not serious enough to portray the President. Having said that, the dialogue is riddled with unnecessary humor, which was more annoying than funny and uncalled for. The film had a serious premise, but it was handled in a very lighthearted manner, killing the potential suspense more often than not. The scenes that were done more seriously, were preceded or followed by comical scenes, deeming even the serious scenes lighthearted. The film had all the material to be an awesome action thriller, but the characters and dialogue were too stereotypical American. The film also had way too many plot holes and convenience, silly remarks and a lot of credibility issues that made me raise an eyebrow. For now, I'll only mention the scene where Will Smith volunteers to fly the alien aircraft, saying he's seen how they manoeuvre. SEEN is completely different to actually FLYING an alien aircraft, and he not only succeeds, but manages to escape through almost impossible obstacles. Another example is Randy Quaid's character, Russell Casse, volunteering to fight the aliens. He flies a plane, yes, but its one thing to be able to fly a plane, but to engage in combat is entirely different. He simply does not have the experience, so it wasn't believable in the least. The music was also too dramatic and overbearing at times.Regardless, this was indeed a very entertaining action sci-fi with some amazing action sequences and visual effects that are good to this day. The aliens in particular were very well designed.",6,3,4,13 August 2018
Gone with the Wind," This really STILL is one of the greatest films ever.
","This is undoubtedly the greatest film ever. The scale of the film is simply mind blowing. It is almost inconceivable to think this was done in a time before computers, before the advanced technology available today, and it STILL looks incredible! The visuals are great, the acting is great, the story itself is fantastic. The role must have been very demanding for Vivien Leigh, who is in almost every single scene of the movie, with a running time of 221 minutes. An absolute masterpiece and true epic!",9,4,6,2 July 2018
The Butterfly Effect," Makes you think...
","The film has some really scary moments thanks to clever editing and excellent sound effects, and some incredible visuals. The film deserves a few viewings, as everything might not make complete sense the first time around. Once you know the story and the outcome, its easier to piece everything together. Ashton Kutcher is excellent in the film. Memory and fantasy starts to blur as Evan (Ashton) reprograms his mind, and he remembers events as he would have wanted them to materialize. The film is all about decisions. How different would our lives be (have been) based on a simple decision at a given moment? The film portrays this so effectively, and makes me think. The film is pretty much about 'What if...'?Very unpredictable ending. Well done!",7,1,2,17 April 2019
No Country for Old Men," Why was this rated such a good movie?
","Yawn. Oh, good, it's over!After an interesting start, the film tumbles to boredom. Tommy Lee Jones talks his usual 'what the hell is he saying' jumble. Javier is a brilliant actor, but he just seems to do everything in slow motion in this film. Is it just me or does the acting seem very, very laidback - almost lazy?The entire film I was rooting for the protagonist, who is then suddenly killed off screen. Uhm, why? The ending is very abrupt and leaves way too many questions unanswered. It leaves you with a sense of 'what the hell'!?",5,2,8,3 July 2018
District 9," An instant favorite to watch again and again...
","I must admit I was skeptical about this film, as the trailer did nothing for my senses and even the premise seemed like something that's been done a hundred times before. But boy, was I in for a surprise! The film gets more interesting as it progresses, and is ultimately absolutely fantastic. It is a thrill ride of note with amazing action sequences and incredible visuals. Sharlo Copley is brilliant as Wikus van der Merwe, and deservedly won a few awards as Best Actor",8,0,1,3 July 2018
Toy Story 4," It just didn't do it for me, I'm afraid...
","Having enjoyed 'Toy Story 3' immensely, I was looking forward to 'Toy Story 4', but at the same time I was worried the story had nowhere left to go.All the main characters from the previous films join together once again for another adventure. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy 'Toy Story 4' as much as I did 'Toy Story 3'. This installment is aimed at a young demographic. Yes, obviously, being animation, but 'Toy Story 3' had a rather mature theme and it was action-packed and exciting. This installment - although also an action adventure - had a very simple premise: get to Bonnie. There were too many incidents reminding me of a cartoon rather than an animated feature. The adventure element was also more childish. Maybe that was their vision for this installment, who knows.Forky was by far my favorite character. At times some of the other characters had so little screen time that I completely forgot about them. Mr & Mrs Potato Head, for example - who were so prominent in 'Toy Story 3' - hardly even features in this film. There are simply too many characters. The comic relief characters Bunny and Ducky were so annoying! The Dummies, on the other hand, were creepy characters, while Gabby Gabby was sinister. As with many Hollywood franchises (Ice Age, How to train your dragon), this one also became a schmultzy love story - Woody and Bo Beep. Hmf.The animation is awesome. Some scenes actually looked like the real thing.",5,3,4,6 November 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Genius plot well executed.
","This is a genius plot to go beyond arcade games to see how the various gaming characters live. Pure entertainment! The animation and voicing was great, and the film also features awesome music. As with most animated films, this film also has a wonderful underlying theme. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and is one of my favorite animated films.",7,0,0,6 June 2018
The Princess Bride," Yuck!! Yuck!! Stupid, bloody yuck!! Ugh!
","Bloody hell, this was beyond annoying!! There was NOTHING remotely magical, funny or interesting about this awful film.I'm not sure whether it was their intention, but everything looked incredibly fake. The sets were so clearly set up in a studio that the entire film looked like a stage production. The fighting sequences were horrible, looking more dim-witted than a pre-school play. And absolutely terribly acted, as well. There was nothing believable about this film. The acting was just bad.For an IMDB top rated movie, this was boring and annoying. I can't believe this is actually intended for adults???? What????!!! This was childish and stupid. The humor was slapstick and anything but funny. The score was very early Disney-ish. Oh, enough with that fu*king music already, my gawd!!I didn't enjoy this one bit. I couldn't wait for it to end, as I simply couldn't handle another second of this slapstick, stupid rubbish. UGHH!!!!Would I watch it again? NO!!! NO!!! NO!! NO!!",1,3,15,19 December 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Even better than the original.
",To call it spectacular is too mild a word. This is perfection in every way. A lot more thrilling and exhilarating than the original. The animation is AMAZING. Definitely aimed at a more mature audience.,9,1,2,3 July 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," One of my favorites!!
","Nominated for 213 awards and winning 125, this is an absolute gem of a film. It is a rare find that is perfect on every level. There simply can not be any doubt as to why the film won so many awards. The storytelling and humor is uniquely different! I was spellbound and mesmerized from beginning to end. Impeccable dialogue. A masterpiece! This is one of my all-time favorite movies.",10,1,2,21 June 2018
28 Days Later...," Very good horror thriller.
","The use of extreme close-up photography (in the beginning) makes it difficult to follow the action at times. This is the most realistic zombie film I've seen to date. I though Cillian Murphy in particular was very good and convincing. The music was lovely and tranquil, in direct contrast to the situation the characters found themselves in, but I thought it worked incredibly well. As the film progresses, it becomes less about the zombies and more about Man's unquenchable desire. Man against Man, as it has always been, regardless of the circumstances. Very good.",6,0,4,28 June 2018
It Follows," Overrated, boring and silly!
","After a promising opening the rest of the film takes a trip down boredom lane, even though the title suggests something sinister. For a horror/thriller (or any genre for that matter) the film has a very lazy feel about it. According to the decor, wallpaper and TV's I assume the film is set in the 80s, but the girl in the opening scene has a cell phone. Nothing about this film makes sense, not the plot nor the character's behavior. Why did Hugh tie Jay to a wheelchair after giving 'it' to her? Why did he drug her in the first place, since by that time he'd already given it to her? This entire scene was just plain dumb. From there the film just gets more vague and silly. What is 'it' and why is it following people (at a snail's pace, I might add). What is the purpose of all this? To make the plot more laughable, 'it' is passed on by having sex. What?? A sexually transmitted demon??? Sounds like a Sunday school story!!The hospital sex scene is unenthusiastic and totally inappropriate. When Jay finally tracks down Hugh, he couldn't be more vague about what's going on, and NO-ONE even bothers to ask what 'it' is and what it wants?????! This 'it' demon is also the most passive demon I've ever seen in a movie, not to mention slow and utterly stupid. There isn't a single scare in the movie. I couldn't wait for it to end. Firstly, because I really wanted it to end. Secondly, because I wanted to know how it would end, I suppose. The film then ends on just as lazy a note as it's been for the past 90 minutes, no climax whatsoever. Critics praised the film. Uhm....why?? Am I missing something here?",3,0,4,2 July 2018
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Awesome entry in series.
","Oh, wow, the best in the series so far! The visual effects are ground-breaking! The story is good, the acting is believable, and the music is great. All round an incredible production! The film also deals with so many emotions and real-life dramatic elements, all combined into an amazing film.",7,0,2,2 July 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," What the hell???!! Why was this such a big success??? CGI Deluxe with no realism whatsoever...
","It honestly baffles the mind as to why this film was such a huge box office success. I didn't like the original 'The Avengers', I loved 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', and now I'm back to not liking 'Avengers: Infinity War'.Firstly, I mean there are way too many characters in this film!! We have the original Avengers Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow and Thor (no Hawkeye in this installment). Now they've added the entire Guardians of the Galaxy crew, Scarlet Witch and Vision from 'Age of Ultron', Black Panther, Doctor Strange, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Spider-man. (What the hell is he doing here???). Loki is back, although only for a (very) short while. Bloody hell, that's a LOT of protagonists for ONE FILM!! With so many characters I actually forgot about some of them when they were not on screen. I mean, Iron Man and Captain America literally were on screen only for a few minutes the entire film! They are also unrecognizable (Thor with short hair, Captain American with a beard and moustache, Black Widow now blonde...) It was way more fun when each character had his own film.Just like 2012's 'The Avengers' this film plays like a medley of superhero films, and not a standalone film. 'Infinity War' was also too fantastical with not an inch of reality. There was not a single screen without CGI and blue or green screen effects. It felt like I was watching a video game. The film clearly illustrates how CGI is taken much too far in films. Oh, so now Iron Man's mask just disappears? And Spider-man's too? And Quill?? Were all of their superhero suits designed by the same person??? It looked silly and felt fake, choosing the easy way out.I found the film boring. I hated 'Black Panther', so needless to say I didn't enjoy any of the Wakanda/Black Panther scenes. This was pure CGI and no excitement whatsoever. Iron Man's suit doesn't look as believable as it did in the first 'Iron Man'. It looks too obvious CGI. My favorite character was the antagonist Thanos, who was probably the deepest character of all, and I completely understood his intentions.I couldn't wait for this installment to end. Oh, thank goodness...But, oh dear me, this is Part 1 of 2...",3,1,3,11 June 2019
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I got SO bored with all the silly sword yielding and obvious wire effects.
","Whenever critics seem to rave about a film, I don't. This is a typical example. The use of obvious wire effects is a bit too much, and there is too much sword-wielding just for the sake of sword-wielding. Later, even the story did not interest me anymore and the action sequences seemed too comedic.Yawn.",5,3,7,3 July 2018
Gone Girl," Good, but ultimately gets boring due to the long running time.
","The film was nominated for 93 awards, and won 28 - most of which went to Rosamund Pike and writer Gillian Flynn. I admit, it was a very good film. Quite fascinating actually as new evidence surface and with a twist around every corner. The plot literally thickens every step of the way, and gets particularly interesting when the victim's 'fate' is revealed halfway through the film. The stakes then get so much higher! Rosamund Pike was indeed good as the titular gone girl, but I thought Kim Dickens was exceptionally good as Detective Rhonda. I did, however, find the film a bit slow moving, as if I wanted to give it a push at times. The film runs 149 minutes, which I found overlong. Way too many scenes were unnecessarily dragged out. The pace could have been greatly improved with shorter scenes.",6,0,1,21 June 2018
Django Unchained," This was so DISGUSTING, I'd like to give it a ZERO rating.
","Although very well made, I honestly can't say its been a pleasure watching this. In fact, there are not enough adjectives to use to describe how I loathed this film. I watched this in utter disgust and hated EVERY minute. Also, how many times must I hear the word n***** in one film??Wait, what?? Calvin Candie (DiCaprio jumps to conclusions because of an ASSUMPTION made by Stephen (Samuel L Jackson) before obtaining ANY facts and this leads to gunfight galore??? THIS is supposed to be where it gets interesting??? Two hours into the film when most films end??? What the bloody hell! And it took almost 3 hours to tell this story??My ONLY positive comment goes to Christoph Waltz, who was excellent in this film.The film won numerous awards. Yeah, blah-blah, who cares...",1,5,15,27 July 2018
Get Out," Well made, but not my cup of tea.
","I honestly wish racism would disappear off the face of the Earth. The film constantly refers to the black and white issue when it really shouldn't matter anymore in this day and age. Films like this make the younger generation question a lot of things, unnecessarily. I initially did not want to watch this because of the racial theme, but decided to watch it due to the media hype. OK, so I've seen it, and it was actually better than expected, but I won't watch it again. Racism films should not be made anymore.The film received over 200 nominations and won 64. Seriously? It was good, but was it really that good??? '",6,1,3,16 June 2018
Drive," I can watch this film just for the soundtrack...
","'Drive' certainly is unlike any vengeance film I've experienced. The film's beginning is seriously short on dialogue. I mean, there are literally moments when characters are together without saying a single word. But the cinematography is so awesome that dialogue are sometimes not necessary.The film's score is awesome! It has a tranquil synthesized mood, resulting in a serene feel, despite the dark theme. The film spends about 40 minutes setting up the scene and the characters (and is never boring), but when the action (and unexpected) arrives around the 45-minute mark, the film really hits you! It grabs you and doesn't let go. Be warned, despite the film's initial tranquility, it becomes brutal and gory - yet ever so stylish and effective.Ryan Gosling is outstanding!! His character is mysterious and seemingly trouble-free (Dan Stevens' character in 2014's 'The Guest' was very similar). 'Drive' is beautifully filmed and will consume you with every frame. By the end of the film one can't help but think what a masterfully crafted film this actually was! Brilliant!!",7,2,3,16 September 2019
Aladdin," It was good, but...
","First things first: the visuals. Wow, impressive. Trust Guy Ritchie (and more than a generous helping of the latest CGI) to bring Aladdin to life in spectacular grandeur. The visuals in 'Aladdin' never ceases to amaze.Now, the casting. I'm a Will Smith fan. He's a versatile actor and I think he makes a wonderful Genie. He fits the profile like a glove. Pity I can't say the same about our hero, Aladdin (Mena Massoud), and his love interest, the princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). None of these two young actors have much film experience and I didn't find them (Aladdin especially) strong enough to carry the film. There was no chemistry between them. (If there were chemistry between any of the characters, it would be between Aladdin and the Genie). The acting was unconvincing and left me cold. I felt nothing. Personally, I thought Aladdin was a stupid character and didn't really root for him.Will Smith was by far the main attraction, from a comedy perspective, and from an interesting character perspective. He even had the most interesting back story. Of everyone in the film, I cared most about him.The production design is superb and the musical segments are stunning! The film is bright and colorful and in general has a very happy, entertaining feel to it. The music and score is also fantastic (except for the new version of 'A Whole new world', which I didn't like at all).The ending was oh-so-cheesy...",6,0,2,10 September 2019
Insidious," Been there, done that.
","The film is about...uhm, well about...what was it again? Oh, this was so forgettable. From the preposterous plot and the forced dialogue to the scares (because of sudden loud music and nothing else) to all the obvious plot flaws, this is one I won't be remembering. Cliché upon cliché upon cliché.The first half of the film is subtle and the scares are effective. The second half of the film becomes rather absurd and totally unconvincing, reminding me of the found-footage genre (just less believable).Yawn...",3,0,1,2 July 2018
The Theory of Everything," A must see film!
","A fantastic depiction of Stephen Hawking's life! Based on fact, this was such an emotional film for me, especially with Eddie Redmayne's phenomenally good portrayal as Stephen. Heartbreaking. One of my favorite films of the year.",9,0,1,2 July 2018
Frozen," Plot flaws deluxe and who's story is it again?
","There is just so much wrong with this film that I honestly can't understand why it became the highest grossing animated film of all time. I mean, it's not even clear whose story is being told: Anna or Elsa? Is Elsa a protagonist disguised as an antagonist, or vice versa? There are also hardly any really likable characters in the film. Even the horse has identical characterization to the one from 'Tangled', released in 2010. The film compares to so many other films that it hardly seemed worth watching this one.There are also so many plot flaws in the film. The one that bothered me the most was that they expected me to believe Elsa was locked up in her room for so many years without leaving the room ONCE. Wow, that's just harsh. And stupid. And just not believable.Yeah well, the film still received 65 nominations, of which it won 37. Whoop-whoop, see if I care. This was a forgettable yawner in my books.",3,1,3,3 July 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," Stunning conclusion of fantastic trilogy.
",The fantastic grand finale in the original trilogy series. They went all-out to bring us a spectacular end to one of the best Marvel superhero franchises. The visuals are top notch and rock solid performances from the talented cast ensure believable execution of a surreal story. Fantastic on every level and one of my favorite sci-fi action adventures.,8,1,1,1 July 2018
The Lives of Others," Captivating and sensual.
","'The Lives of Others' is an interesting movie. It is dramatic, sensual, sexual and captivating, and offers quite a few twists and unexpected events.Sebastian Koch is very good as Georg Dreyman, a writer under surveillance. Unbeknownst to him, his love life, every day routine, and conversations with his friends - and even plans to smuggle a friend across the border - are being recorded, as his entire apartment is being monitored. Instead of reporting him, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler - who is in charge of the investigation - can't wait for his surveillance turn to follow Georg's life. Wiesler is excellently portrayed by Ulrich Muhe. One can't help but become absorbed by the characters, wanting to see and hear more.There's so much irony in the film. 'The Lives of Others' definitely deserves more than just one viewing. Although it might loose its appeal with a second viewing, it will still be worth it.",7,0,0,29 November 2019
Good Will Hunting," Well made and well acted, but ultimately not my cup of tea.
","Let's face it: I hated mathematics at school and still do today, so the film didn't appeal to me in that sense, but it appealed to me in respect of life's lessons. I also enjoyed the film due to Robin Williams, whom I just love as an actor. This was a very dramatic and emotional role for him, which he did brilliantly. Matt Damon was also very good and believable as the young rebel. Ben Affleck's character was unnecessary and mostly silly and I found he ruined the scenes where he was present (although the character does give the best advise towards the end). Minnie Driver was also excellent as the love interest Skylar. She really gave a powerful performance.As expected, although interesting, the film became dreary to a point where I couldn't wait for the credits to roll. Due to the film's long running time, the events in the film didn't capture my attention enough to satisfy my movie experience needs. It did have a satisfying ending, though, as both Will Hunting and the psychologist (Robin Williams) gained from their sessions.'Good Will Hunting' is regarded as one of the top rated films of all time (and, yes, I can understand why), and won numerous awards including two Oscars.This is a film I'll probably never watch again, regardless of how well made and well acclaimed.",7,0,0,27 November 2018
Room," Yes, it was very good, but...
","A few minutes into the film I asked myself 'What the hell am I watching' and thought the characters were completely dysfunctional. Then it hit me BAM!! what was going on and it became very, very interesting. Once mother and son were rescued, though, the film became slow moving and a bit depressing, actually, with constant yelling and sadness.The script and acting was superb, I'll admit. Jacob Tremblay in particular was excellent! It was interesting how the Room held good memories for the son, while it was an absolute nightmare for the mother.",6,2,5,18 July 2018
The Lion King," Don't compare it with the original, watch it for the masterpiece it is.
","Loving the original film so much, and hearing lots of negative remarks about this remake, I was very skeptical watching it. I had so many preconceived thoughts about this movie. After much deliberation, though, I finally decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.Wow, I'm glad I did! 'The Lion King 2019' exceeded all my expectations in abundance. Firstly, the element everyone is raving about: the animation. I mean honestly, can it possibly get any better?? This film proves just how far animation has come and what they can accomplish nowadays (with the right budget, off course). Its hard to believe not a single real animal was used for the film. They all look so incredibly realistic. Scar is a really creepy character in this 'live action' adaptation.Regarding the voicing, the only actor reprising his voice work, is James Earl Jones as Mufasa. I missed the sarcasm Jeremy Irons so perfectly added to Scar's character. It made him sound even more devious. The other voice work is fine, I don't really have complaints there. (Only that I also really missed Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi).Since these are now real - or should I say 'realistic' - animals, I actually found it funnier and much scarier than the original. The suspense was a lot more intense. It was also more emotional with realistic animals. Then there were some scenes that were honestly too cute for words! I highly anticipated the musical segments, which were so colorful in the animated film, and I must say they didn't disappoint here. Obviously a lot more realistic, these segments were stunning.I've heard a lot of complaints from viewers saying the animals have no emotion - or lack the emotion of the original film. Well obviously. We certainly can't have animals doing the things they did in the animated film. It would look kind of awkward and not credible. On the contrary, the animals actually have a lot of emotion and was so realistic within the context of the film. They had all the emotion I expect real animals to have: joy, fear, sadness, remorse...'The Lion King' is still one of the most incredible stories ever written. This 2019 'live action' film did not disappoint. It is an absolutely beautiful movie. It is spectacular and stunning in its production and looks incredible on screen. This is a gem of a movie!!Regarding all the negative reviews I've seen, I wonder how they would have rated the movie if this was an original with nothing to compare it with? I've heard complaints about them not using the same voices or music, but what would the point of a remake be if you use exactly the same actors? Rather rate the movie as a stand alone, and not a comparison.",9,1,4,5 November 2019
The Incredibles," Oh, whatever...
","Ok, get this: Superheroes are forced to live as normal people (for 15 years!!), and then surface again because a superhero wannabe terminates superheroes. Yawn, did nothing for me!",4,2,4,2 July 2018
A Quiet Place," Better than expected, justifying the hype.
","I initially did not want to watch this, as I feared it would be similar to the highly acclaimed yet utterly boring films 'It comes at night' and 'It follows'. 'A Quiet Place' was equally acclaimed, and in this instance, I must admit I was wrong and the film justified the high acclaim. This is a very unique film and interesting concept. Despite the very little dialogue or sound in the film, this was remarkably never boring. On the contrary, I was completely spellbound and literally sat on the edge of my seat waiting for the family to make a mistake.What I found interesting about this film compared to most other post-apocalyptic films is the fact they never show or tell you what actually happened for the family to be in the situation they're in. But I enjoyed the fact they kept the plot simple, and never over-complicated it with back stories and twists. This is essentially a survival tale. The film had to rely (a lot!) on the actors' abilities to make this work, and they did! The acting was superb - especially John Krasinski, who is ultimately the hero.Naturally - in a film like this - you're bound to have plot flaws and there are a number of them. My biggest issue was right in the beginning when the family let their 4-year old son walk BEHIND all of them, without anyone even holding his hand. They were so concerned about sound and the elements surrounding them, yet this was apparently perfectly in order. There's also a scene where they play Monopoly and even use fibre pieces instead of metal. From outside, you surely won't be able to hear ordinary Monopoly pieces on a board from the confines of your home, so this was taking the idea just a bit too far. Also, why are they using lanterns and candles if they have electricity? The creatures are blind anyway. Keeping the newborn baby silent was also not believable. It's simply impossible to keep a baby quiet at all times. The film would have done better without the baby.Despite all these and numerous other flaws, though, it was a very good film and very different. The chemistry between the characters were also very good (although I found their daughter Regan a bit annoying). Oh, and what I wouldn't give to kiss John Krasinski's thick moustache...just saying...",7,5,7,21 August 2018
Ghostbusters," Good old-fashioned entertainment at its best.
","The film must have been phenomenal for its time. Even at today's standard, the visual effects are still amazing, so it must have been groundbreaking back in '84. It deservedly was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. In a time well before CGI was so advanced, this was incredibly believably done. From the plot to the acting and the music, this is entertainment deluxe. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are legends! And off course, who will ever forget that giant Marshmallow Man!!?",7,0,0,3 July 2018
The Hurt Locker," Critics must really enjoy boring movies...
","Winner of 6 Oscars. Really?? No better films at the time? Too often too little happens. Tension builds to nothing. I don't enjoy the shaky camera work and still not sure what the film is actually about. Quite tedious, really.",3,4,7,6 July 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Delightful, vibrant comedy drama musical.
","Filled with music, dance, amazing visuals, love, drama, humor, action, suspense and naturally a bit of weirdness (being a Luhrmann film), this is a film I can watch again and again, and again. I must admit, though, it might be an acquired taste at first, like sipping on on good bottle of wine or nibbling on swiss cheese. The more you taste it, the more acquired you become and the more you want! The effortless blend of so many fantastic songs into one incredible medley is simply fascinating, to say the least. The visuals alone make the film worth watching. The casting is perfect, notably Jim Broadbent as Harold Zidler.",10,2,2,3 July 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Forgettable entry in the series.
","Oh, what have they done? The X-Men series built a reputation on being a stylish fantasy series. Unfortunately, this addition is not as stylish and didn't feel as special as the other films in the series.The film offers nothing to distinguish itself from they myriad of 'I want to rule the world' fantasy films out there. It played like just another one of these fantasy films, with familiar characters scattered here and there. 'Apocalypse' is also all over the place, with way too much going on, and definitely too CGI-heavy. The over-use of CGI removes every inch of realism (despite the film being a fantasy, off course, but I mean within the context of the genre). The most interesting scene by far was Quicksilver's rescue mission prior to a huge explosion. Very well done!Even the regular X-Men characters were not as interesting. Neither was the story. It was too formulaic and not gripping in the least. With a run time of 144 minutes (yawn) I was quite relieved when it ended. (Uhm, how did it end again? Oh well, see, its forgettable...)",4,0,0,22 March 2020
Ex Machina," A Film like no other...
","You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand 'Ex Machina', but it certainly would help! No, it's not that bad. If you can wrap your head around all the technical and scientific terminology, this is actually quite an easy to follow film.From the opening scene, the one thing that grabbed me, was the stunning cinematography. Now throw in awesome visuals, an incredible script and great dialogue, and excellent actors, and you have a film like no other. It did give me a sense of '2001: A Space Odyssey' feel - with a robot, or computer, becoming self-absorbed with thinking ability, and ultimately evil. The actors did a great job in selling the authenticity of the probabilities to me. Is this what the future holds? One can only speculate, and hope it doesn't come to this. Job well done, Alex Garland.",7,0,0,21 October 2019
Transformers," The best action film in a while!
","Hats off to Michael Bay, who went beyond anything - or any visuals - we've seen before to bring us this action fantasy spectacle. Almost every scene is masterfully done. The film is visually stunning and the action scenes are INCREDIBLE! The film combines so many elements of danger and suspense, and its also actually really funny during the lighthearted moments. It blends perfectly.Shia LaBeouf is very good in this film. The score by Steve Jablonsky is also really good and very effective. For a film with a running time of 144 minutes there literally never was a dull moment, as it kept the viewer engaged and captivated all the time. There honestly hasn't been an exciting action film like this is a while - certainly not on this level! Bloody hell, it was awesome! This was an absolute delight and feast to watch. Yeah, this is how you start a multi-billion dollar franchise!",8,5,7,12 May 2019
Coco," One of the best animated films.
","Well now, this was a very special little film! What a delightful, vibrant and colorful movie! The animation is fantastic and the film itself is completely and utterly stunning on so many levels. There are interesting twists and reveals that one wouldn't expect, and beneath the candy coated facade lies a very deep message. I LOVED Dante the dog - he's just my absolute favorite character in the film, and Coco - such a sweet old lady. Anthony Gonzales was excellent voicing the protagonist, Miguel.I found the film to be an updated version of 'The Corpse Bride' and 'The Book of Life' - only the latter was very cartoonish and not as enjoyable. 'Coco', however, was pure delight. And if you don't shed a tear or two at the end, you must be dead!",9,0,1,13 June 2018
1917," Incredibly well made war drama.
","Well, this was a very different war movie! Much of the film works only because of the stunning camera work and cinematography, and great acting by Dean-Charles Chapman. The film has a great production design and hauntingly beautiful score. It is also visually stunning. There's a scene where he wanders through the ruins of a city, being lit only by bombs going off in the distance - and it is an absolutely beautiful, mesmerizing scene. '1917' is filled with spectacular scenes.This is one of those rare movies I can't really fault in any way, although it probably won't go down as one of my favorite films. Every scene was done to perfection and the film flows effortlessly and beautifully. I only have praise for this film.
'1917' is a moving drama about friendship, loyalty and determination against all odds.",8,2,4,10 March 2020
Casualties of War," Effective, emotional drama
","Firstly, don't watch this movie expecting an all-out war movie. The film is a character study of soldiers during a war, and the crimes they commit simply because they believe they have the means and power to do so. In the midst of all this, is one soldier (Michael J Fox) who still believes in morals during war.Thuy Thu Le was incredible as the kidnapped villager. Sean Penn was excellent as the antagonist and Michael J Fox equally good as the protagonist. The film is an emotional journey of torture, rape and humiliation. I couldn't help but wonder how many times this possibly happened during wars over the years. The film is as effective in stirring emotion as it is in still believing in the good in people.",7,1,1,14 February 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Animated masterpiece!
","Another Tim Burton masterpiece! My review of this film can be summarized in a single word: STUNNING! This is just such a perfect film I can't faulter in any way. The animation, the music, the visuals, the characters, the plot was amazing. This is a visual feast and musical treat. Pure delight!",8,1,1,4 June 2018
Mulholland Drive," I had no fun whatsoever watching this!
","What the heck did I just watch!!? Is this film slow for the sake of being slow with dreary characters for the sake of being dreary? An hour into the film I was annoyed with all the characters and bored as hell. At times I actually thought the film was playing in slow motion. And what weird dialogue!There were moments I thought the film was intended to be a comedy, although a very bad comedy at that. Not only was the film slow moving, but even the characters uttered their dialogue very, very slowly. Yawn... The film just didn't grab me at all. There were just so many moments that should have been on the editing floor instead. And then the film turned out to be nothing more than a lesbian affair gone wrong!!! What the hell!I couldn't wait for this utterly dreary film to end. Yup, there's a huge twist, but by that time I really couldn't care anymore. True, everything would make better sense with a second viewing, but there's no way I'm sitting through this again just for the twist ending...This is not what I expected and I had no joy watching this.",1,2,8,22 April 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," Wow, this was amazing!
","Don't expect the lively, colorful animation you've come to expect from animation films from around the world. The Japanese animated films have their own unique trademark. This was a wonderful and moving story about a protective brother looking after his little sister after their home was destroyed in an air raid during the war. Although they successfully overcome many obstacles on their way, fate ultimately intervened. There is such a beautiful bond between brother and sister, and how he would do anything to make her happy. Although the film is filled with fireflies, I don't quite understand the title, as a grave for the fireflies is merely a scene lasting a few seconds. Wow, such a sad movie.",8,0,0,11 June 2018
Brave," Absolutely stunning!
","Wow, 'Brave' is just so much fun! The animation is awesome. I absolutely love everything about this film. It tells a fantastic story, has very likable characters with great accents, and there are no annoying comic relief characters. This was just really funny. Hilarious, actually! Angus the horse is just adorable.The fun escalates significantly when the witch's curse starts working, and our hero must find a way to reverse the spell again. There are a few interesting twists along the way, as well. This was stunning!! It is a film young and old will enjoy, although a young audience might not understand the deeper meaning, and might not get the twists if they didn't pay close attention to the detail in the beginning of the film. 'Brave' is one of my all-time favorite and most loved animated films.",9,1,1,12 May 2019
Brave," One of my favorite animated films.
","Absolutely brilliant - from the animation to the plot, this is a wondrously stunning and entertaining film!!

Awesome.",9,0,1,31 July 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Better than expected, actually.
","As I'm not a big superhero movie fan, I actually expected not to like this, but I was thoroughly entertained! Hats off to director James Gunn for a styling job well done! The visuals and special effects are incredible, and the non-human characters look amazingly real and blend perfectly with their surroundings. The action is flawless. A good blend of action, suspense and humor. Entertainment value: 10/10. Visuals & make-up: 10/10. Oh, Rocket has to be my favorite Guardian! Bradley Cooper voices him so well!Uhmmm, why was Vin Diesel cast to voice Groot? He literally has ONE sentence - which he says about a hundred times throughout the film: 'I am Groot', and off course 'We are Groot' at the end. OK, so he had TWO sentences to learn. They might well have recorded the sentence and used playback. No-one would have noticed.",6,1,3,3 July 2018
The Imitation Game," Captivating, to say the least!!
","This was Norwegian director Morten Tyldum's first English feature, and he certainly did a styling job! This is easily one of the best films I've seen, mainly thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch's amazing portrayal of our hero, Alan Turning. Fascinating, intriguing and compelling, this was a thrill to watch! Benedict is just SO GOOD! Based on a true story, I was even more captivated.",10,0,1,3 July 2018
Clash of the Titans," CGI-heavy but exciting action.
","A big cast that wasn't really required, as the (sometimes overused) CGI Effects steal the show anyway. There are very few scenes without CGI, but admittedly some of these scenes are pretty awesome - especially the desert scorpion battle scene, and the Medusa fighting scene. This is non-stop action and entertainment from beginning to end.The film is not short on plot flaws and while I won't go into them, I'm just wondering why the powerful Hades needs to transform a mere mortal to pursue and kill Perseus, instead of killing him himself. He was able to 'consume' over a dozen guards in the beginning after all. Liam Neeson seems out of character as Zeus, and I must be honest Ralph Fiennes is way to good an actor for this kind of film. Sam Worthington, on the other hand, makes a worthy protagonist.",6,0,0,13 June 2018
Jurassic World," Well made, but not as good as the original.
","Although incredibly well-made and entertaining in its own right, I still prefer the original from 20 years ago. Some of the suspense and emotion just feels 'forced' compared to the original where it came naturally. This modernized version just didn't do it for me. It also made me realize how incredible the visual effects of the original actually were, as they seemed more realistic. The effects in this new film are more obvious CGI than 'Jurassic Park'.",6,0,0,1 July 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," Not impressed.
","Nope. Don't like it. Apart from slow-moving, too much happens by chance. The film is also too much 'about the girl' and not even romantic at that. Not a film I'd want to see again.",2,0,2,5 July 2018
Uri: The Surgical Strike," INCREDIBLE!!
","Oh, wow, this was simply incredible! This is one of the best Hindi films I've seen.The film is set in 2016, and depicts India's retaliation after four Pakistani terrorists attacked an Indian military base. It was the first time in history India attacked a country first. Despite the film's long run time, it was fast paced with never a dull moment. It was exciting from the beginning, and never overstayed its welcome. The action scenes are incredibly well done, and the film also has deeply emotional moments. Vicky Kaushal is excellent as protagonist Major Vihan Singh Shergill.The film reminded me to some extent of 'Eye in the sky' and '13 Hours', only this was much better. 'Uri' is a fascinating film based on actual events. The cinematography is awesome, and the score fantastic. This is a top-notch production and an instant favorite.",10,0,1,27 May 2019
Black Hawk Down," Excellent, but my gawd, it was brutal!
","Brutal in every sense of the word. Realistic and disturbing, the film left me feeling sick at times and I honestly could not stomach some of the scenes. The film actually brilliantly depicts the horrors of war, and a very good cast ensure credibility. This is one of those films (like Saving Private Ryan) that is so well made that I only want to see it once, since I won't stomach it a second time.",7,1,3,3 July 2018
A Bug's Life," Definitely aimed at a young audience.
","Cute family fun about an inventor ant named Flik, yet the more he tries to help, the more he seems to mess up. Until het gets a chance to save the colony from grasshoppers - with the help of circus bugs! Great story and feel-good fun entertainment, but definitely aimed at a young demographic. Typical pre-school material.",5,0,1,3 July 2018
Prisoners," Hugh Jackman at his very best!!
","The entire cast is absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. Casting was perfectly done. This is the most serious I've ever seen Hugh Jackman and he does it so incredibly well that I hade goosebumps more often than not. From the plot to the execution thereof was brilliantly done to bring us an unforgettable, thrilling masterpiece. Be warned, though, as the film is quite disturbing at times.",9,9,13,28 June 2018
Logan," Oh no, they've turned an exciting franchise into a dreary drama.
","Unfortunately I did not enjoy this at all, mostly because I did not like this vision of the X-Men. The film plays more like a drama than a fantasy superhero film and the (very little) effects are mediocre compared to the previous films. Wolverine is a passive, pathetic character that actually deserves to die. The film is also unbearably noisy at times with way too much yelling and screaming. I'll conveniently forget I've seen this. Wolverine was brilliant in the three X-Men films, and X-Men Origins, which explained how he became Wolverine. The Wolverine followed his adventures after 'X-Men: The Last Stand', and then already did I get a feeling there were nothing more to tell about this character. 'Logan' therefore was an unnecessary installment. We learn that he has a daughter - a cloned daughter! Seriously, I hope they don't clone Wolverine for another sequel...Dafne Keen was fantastic as his daughter and I predict a great future for her.",4,2,7,3 July 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Incredible action, and more depth.
","I didn't like 'The Avengers' but nevertheless decided to give 'Age of Ultron' the benefit of the doubt and watch it. I'm glad I did.I must be honest, after the opening - which made the film look more like a video game than a live action movie - I had little hope of enjoying it. Thankfully the film vastly improved after the opening scene. Some of the visuals were overdone, but for most part the visuals were spectacular. The slow motion photography with stuff happening all over the screen was incredible. Hollywood's inclination to destroy as much as possible in these movies never cease, do they, but I admit it really was actually fun in this movie.This was the most I've enjoyed the Tony Stark character since 2008's 'Iron Man'. In fact, I enjoyed ALL the characters so much more than in 'The Avengers'. They had more flesh to them (uhm, figuratively speaking, off course). The plot and characters had more depth, and I enjoyed the chemistry between Black Widow and Hulk. It was subtle and sincere.'Age of Ultron' was wonderful entertainment from beginning to end. The attack on the city during the finale was sensational!! This honestly was a lot of fun!",7,1,3,8 June 2019
Everest," Awesome adventure drama.
","Incredibly realistic and very, very well made. The veteran cast make this believable and we root for all the characters, as there is no antagonist here, except for Everest...
This was a captivating and emotional ride. 
I had the pleasure of seeing this in 3D and it was really awesome!",6,0,1,6 July 2018
Into the Wild," Oh, whatever...
","Sean Penn did a good job bringing the film to life. However, I have so many issues with this film.The cinematography is beautiful, helped off course by the stunning landscapes. The dialogue is very poetic, and the performances were good. The extreme close-up photography, though, was a bit nauseating at times.The film can easily be seen as a celebration of life (albeit a bit extreme!), and to explore and experience the beauty of nature. Nowadays we tend to forget nature actually exists. As for Chris, he did some nonsensical things along the way. Often, he came across as extremely ungrateful, and even selfish. His argument for not needing (any) money was absurd.There were moments I felt the film was stagnating, and I wanted to push it along. 148 minutes is just way too long for a film like this to sit through, especially also since it is slow moving, and the non-linear narration. So, although it is a very well made film, - and there probably are a few lessons to be learnt here - it simply wasn't entertaining enough.Based on fact, I'm wondering whether I should actually feel sorry for real-life Chris McCandless, on who's adventures the film is based. He brought what happened to him upon himself. Pure self-indulgence! He didn't think his adventure through properly and didn't plan ahead, and certainly didn't do enough research - typical spoiled brat! Having given his ENTIRE savings to charity tells me he was never planning on returning, and that this was probably a suicide mission.After more than tow hours and an ending I somehow predicted, I was really glad when it ended.",3,1,1,5 May 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Is this supposed to be a positive message??
","Although uniquely different and praised by critics, I did not enjoy this film. Instead I found it very negative. I can only praise the acting and visual effects. Nothing else.",5,1,2,3 July 2018
Avatar," Yup, this WAS awesome!!
","Ah, yes, the greatest film ever made - according to box office takings, at least. Love it or hate it, there is no denying this is pure brilliance! The grand scale of the entire production is simply mind blowing. The effects are unlike anything we've ever seen and is quite mesmerizing, actually. Action, adventure, humor, drama, exhilarating action sequences and a world full of magic and color ensure entertainment deluxe. Add a brilliant cast and a credible hero in the form of Sam Worthington and I can easily see why this film became the highest earning film in movie history. The tranquility of the Avatar world gives us a sense of escapism and makes us wish we ourselves could plunge into this world of pure bliss and perfection. Our hero goes from paraplegic in the real world to a perfect being in the Avatar world, so why wouldn't we also want to escape into this awesome world?The destruction of the Big Tree must be one of the most awesome scenes!!",10,2,3,2 July 2018
Drag Me to Hell," So much better than expected.
","Firstly, allow me to say I thought the role of Christine Brown was way too big and demanding for Alison Lohman and she simply couldn't pull it off convincingly. Apart from this total miscast, the film was indeed very enjoyable. The visual effects are excellent, to say the least! Very eerie at times. As the film progresses, it becomes more humorous than scary, especially the sacrifice ritual with medium Shaun San Dena, which is a bit silly actually. Having said this, though, this is typical of a Sam Raimi film. The film then returns to scary for the final, and I must say I loved the movie's final moment! I did find Christine's curse a bit harsh, though, considering her only crime was refusing a loan agreement (again). If she caused the death of a loved one, I could understand the curse, or if she caused severe bodily harm or trauma to Mrs Ganush. But she didn't. The whole competing for the assistant manager position was also done very amateurishly and quite childish. In closing, I must admit I enjoyed the film in general.",5,0,1,28 June 2018
Mama," This was awesome!
","The scariest, most unpredictable film I've seen in a long time. Fantastic photography, sound and effects, with brilliant acting, especially Jessica Chastain as Annabelle. Fantastic effects during the film's climax. An instant classic and favorite! Another incredible Guillermo del Toro production.",7,1,1,2 July 2018
Super 8," Entertaining despite all the plot flaws.
","The child actors in this film are fantastic, especially Riley Griffiths as the 'director' Charles Kaznyk. It is essentially two stories in one: the kids making a film for a contest and trying to find production value; and the quest by the military to capture an escaped alien. Although brilliantly done, there are a number of flaws. The train crash sequence is absolutely brilliant, but it seems too incredible that no one got hurt during all this. Also, despite all the chaos and explosions, the camera is still found exactly where they left it. And with containers and debris raining all over, their car is still left intact - not a scratch! This is simply not believable. And then they simply drive off - the tires would surely be punctured by all that debris.I found the ending also too much of an E.T-ish happy ending. The creature in 'Super 8' is a destructive killing machine, yet at the end the sentiment is 'ahh, he just wants to go home'. Uhm, not believable. It would have been great to see a climatic battle at the end with the military killing the monster. The ending is not suited for this film. Nevertheless, it is still an enjoyable, action packed, thrilling adventure.",6,0,0,21 June 2018
Sinister," So good, it was disturbing!
","This was more disturbing than scary and one you probably shouldn't watch alone because of the unsettling premise. I found in interesting, albeit very disturbing, until the final twist, which ruined the film in a way as everything that happened seemed a waste of time (not from a watching point of view but from the protagonist's point of view).The film had some great scenes and also some scenes I simply could not watch.",6,0,0,2 July 2018
Life Is Beautiful," Life is Beautiful is absolutely beautiful!!
","'Life is Beautiful' is a heart wrenching drama disguised as a comedy. Wow, this was awesome!Roberto Begnini is excellent as Guido, the most lovable con artist you will ever meet. The film uses interesting and unique dialogue that is actually really funny. At times Roberto comes across as the Italian version of Mr Bean. He simply is excellent.The first half of the film sets up Guido's character and the people he cares about, and its so easy to love them. Around the halfway mark, the film takes an unexpected, dramatic turn. Despite the deep and sad theme, they manage to keep the film lighthearted thanks to Guido's attempts to fool his son into thinking the harsh reality is actually part of a game. To my knowledge, this is the first ever for a film to take this approach on serious matters like war and the horrors against Jews. One could argue that it is no laughing matter, but I believe this was not their intention. It simply is a dreary situation viewed through the eyes of a happy-go-lucky dad trying to protect his son, and trying to remain calm regardless of the odds.By the time the film reaches the final moments, it is truly heart wrenching. I never thought a comedy could be this heartbreaking! You simply have to see it to believe it. (Similar to the Korean film 'Miracle in Cell No. 7). This is a gem of a movie!",8,1,1,8 November 2019
The Legend of 1900," Simply spectacular!
","The Legend of 1900' offers a unique premise we haven't seen before. This is an extraordinary film.The film gave me that epic 'Titanic' feel, just not as commercial, and a love story of an entirely different kind. A love for music - the piano to be more specific. 'The Legend of 1900' will definitely have a greater appeal to musicians and in particular jazz musicians. Even if you're not a musician, this is an interesting watch and a film to be admired for so many reasons.'The Legend of 1900' is visually beautiful. The production design is incredible and the photography and cinematography stunning. Acting from the entire cast is very good, but especially Tim Roth in the lead. He embraces the character to perfection.The story is told in a non-linear manner, but it is easy enough to follow. Despite the film's long running time, it keeps the viewer glued. It felt as if the story was being told to me, and I couldn't wait to hear what direction the story would steer in. During the film's final moments there are come credibility issues, which I won't mention in order not to create spoilers. Despite that, though, this was an incredible watch - a film I thoroughly enjoyed! This was quite spectacular, actually.",7,0,0,13 April 2020
The Fly," Classic horror done perfectly!
","Its hard to believe this film was made over three decades ago! Visually, it still holds so well by today's standards, so try to imagine how incredible it looked at the time of release way back in '86. This film certainly stood the test of time!Of the many films Jeff Goldblum made, this is the one I'll remember him for. His performance here is nothing short of brilliant (and he deservedly won the Best Actor award). The props, creature and practical effects are epic! Seth (Goldblum)'s transformation is one of the best I've ever seen on film. Starting with subtle changes, it gets progressively worse until he has completely transformed. The process of transformation is cringe worthy - some scenes are so graphic and insanely well made that I found myself hiding my face behind my hands! And this for a film made 34 years ago!! Some scenes were actually quite sickening. The make-up is also excellent, ensuring the transformation has a very realistic look and feel.John Getz is quickly set up as the bad guy in the scenario, but interestingly enough, he becomes the good guy as the film progresses, and is so well portrayed by Getz. The romance interest between Seth and Veronica (Geena Davis) started a bit too soon, but being such a short film, they didn't waste any time in setting up the scene. A love interest tends to make us root more for the victim - in this instance I believe both Seth and Veronica to be a victim.'The Fly' is one of my all-time favorite horror films, and a classic at that.",7,1,1,5 April 2020
How to Train Your Dragon," Fantastic for young and old alike
","Oh, this was just fantastic! Great premise. Great animation. Great voicing. Great music. This was just such a sweet little film. 'Never judge a book by its cover' has probably never been better depicted - in this case from the young Viking Hiccup's perspective, as well as from the dragons. It is a story about an unlikely friendship, and how if affects everyone and everything around them. I loved the characters and the story. What an absolutely beautiful film. This is the type of animation film that will appeal to young and old.",8,0,0,8 June 2018
Don't Breathe," Thanks to Stephen Lang, this is awesome!!
","A simple plot with a limited cast and limited locations, yet so many twists and oh-so-unpredictable! The cast is excellent and you feel the chill down your spine! Stephen Lang in particular is outstanding as the blind man.",7,0,0,3 July 2018
Beauty and the Beast," This might be a classic tale, but the film is no classic!
","I'm sorry to say this was not nearly as entertaining or captivating as 2015's 'Cinderella'. Despite the great cinematography and incredible visuals, I found it over the top and ultimately predictable. CGI certainly has come a long way and blends very realistically with the real world, so credit to the director where credit is due. Unfortunately, though, I think the film would have done perfectly well without all that CGI. In fact, at times it becomes cartoonish and silly. Furthermore, there's not an inch of credibility to the film. The characters are incredibly bland and boring, probably because they were acting in front of blue/green screens and in studios for most of the film. The characters just didn't feel like part of their surroundings.When Belle sees the Beast for the first time - looking like the Devil himself - she's not even a teensy weensy bit scared of him. Without any hesitation or questions she simply accepts him for being a beast and even when she's held against her will, she still remains cocky and demanding. Uhm, now that's believable for you. Not! I also found the reason behind the curse pathetic. Such an extreme curse just because he wouldn't accept a rose? Fair enough, the reason probably runs much deeper, but its not as if he was responsible for the death of the witch's loved ones or something like that. And to curse EVERYONE in the castle??? That witch has some SERIOUS issues!!The love story was also very unconvincing and predictable and seemed forced more often than not. There was no chemistry between Belle and Beast - or any of the characters for that matter! (The best chemistry was between Gaston and LeFou). The attack scene on the castle was just stupid! It was done so silly and without feeling that it was simply not entertaining. In fact, I found the scene overbearing and painful to watch. And why was Beast not part of this scene? Why was he upstairs staring into oblivion instead of defending his castle or his people? So he was still being selfish. Gosh, he so deserve to be cursed! The confrontation between Gaston and Beast was also not effective, as they've never interacted before. It was just pure Hollywood sensation without any depth. It was bland. Stupid. Horrible. And I'm not even going to elaborate on how utterly silly the transformation scene was once the curse was broken...I also found the Beast's appearance to be very inconsistent. At times it looked really awesome and even scary. Other times it looked like a mask rented from a party supply store. Yes, I know it was all CGI - and maybe that's where the problem lies. Although this is a classic tale, I doubt the film will go down as a classic.",5,0,1,8 June 2018
Pretty Woman," The perfect comedy.
","Another great example of a naturally funny comedy, thanks mostly to Julia Roberts' wonderful portrayal as the prostitute. Wonderful premise and wonderful acting. The chemistry between Richard Gere and Julia Roberts makes it work to credible perfection. This is one of my all-time favorite comedies.",8,0,1,28 June 2018
The Descent," Exceptionally good!
","Shocking opening scene. The film has stunning nature shots in the beginning. The cast is brilliant, and the film is interesting from the beginning, and never gets boring. Once they're inside the cave, some scenes really feel claustrophobic - very effectively done. I was nervous for every move the characters made, not knowing what might await them around the next corner. Unlike most horror movies where I jolt in my seat with fright because of a sudden blare of music and not because of what happens, this film delivers genuine scares, even without music. Now, that's the qualities of a real scare-fest! The second half of the film more than compensates for the lack of blood in the first half, loaded with blood, guts and gore so nerve-wrecking that I honestly found it difficult to watch some of the scenes. It was just that well done! Quite terrifying, actually, and definitely not everyone's cup of tea, so be warned. It is also nice to see how the weakest character becomes the strongest. Exceptionally well made film.",8,4,6,1 July 2018
Inside Man," Well acted, well written, but not my cup of tea, really...
","There's no denying 'Inside Man' is a very good production, with an all-star cast. However, I found the film would have been much better paced had it been about 20 minutes shorter.Almost the entire film is set inside the bank. Being such a long film - with more talk than action - it was so drawn out that it lost all sense of urgency. Even the robbers operated at such a snail's pace that moments in the film became - dare I say - tedious. Inter-cutting between the robbery and interrogations ruined the suspense for me, and already gave us an idea what happened after the robbery. I didn't want to see that as early as around the 30-minute mark. (Unnecessary) Humor elements and character's private lives also took up a lot of screen time. The film deviated way too often from the matter at hand.The acting was very good, but then again, there wasn't really much for the actors to do, was there? I still don't fully understand Jodie Foster's character, Madeleine. There's this great importance about her character, but then she doesn't achieve anything noteworthy. She tried, but that's about it.I did enjoy the constant sense of mystery. Ultimately, though, it just wasn't worth sitting through 128 minutes just to enjoy the mystery element. There are far more enjoyable movies in this genre out there. (Note, I said more enjoyable, indicating this is not a bad film - don't get me wrong on that. From a entertainment point of view, it just didn't score high enough for me). The only real action comes from a reenactment of Captain John's thoughts (played by Dafoe). And it lasts about 30 seconds or so...Would I watch it again? No.",5,0,1,2 May 2020
Les Misérables," Incredible production, but no.
","Let's face it, I'm a big Hugh Jackman fan, and due to the media and critics referring to the film as 'sensational', I eagerly anticipated watching the film. Boy, was I disappointed. The film is no doubt visually stunning, and from that perspective a masterpiece, actually. The plot, however, left very little to be desired. No one in this film seem to recognize anyone, and everyone seem to die for no apparent reason, and they have a little boy lead a revolution!! The young lovers in the form of Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried becomes inseparable after having just met. Nothing about this film is convincing, not even the singing (which, quite frankly, became way too much for me to swallow). Russell Crowe is completely miscast and his character also dies in the most pathetic way. I mean, seriously?!",5,1,6,2 July 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Ugh!!! AWFUL!!!
","Writer: 'Hey, I have a lot of jokes, but don't know what to do with all of them.' Producer: 'Let's write all the jokes down and turn them into a movie.' Writer: 'Great, but what's the plot?' Producer: 'Who cares, just add loads of CGI to the jokes; it'll work.'This was seemingly the mentality behind 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'. My word, what an awful movie!! The humor was so effective and funny in the first film, but here it is overbearing and so slapstick that only Americans will find it funny. This film is so thickly layered with humor and CGI that there was not an inch of seriousness or reality to the entire film. The feuding sisters, Gamora and Nebula, were so incredibly annoying and laughable that it was cringe worthy. I mean, honestly...!!'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' proves one should never add too many ingredients to a recipe that works well. This was just overdone on every level. The action scenes were cartoonish, the visual effects looks like it was done in a hurry, the use of CGI is so heavy, at times I thought I was watching an animated film or a computer game. A LOT of time was spent on unnecessary silly moments, so much so that I often reached for the remote control to skip past these awful scenes.There's also so much inconsistency in the film and the premise is preposterous, to say the least. There was nothing interesting about any of the characters. And why were there scenes when Drax all of a sudden had piercing blue eyes, while most of the times they were yellow-ish. They were never blue in the first film. Speaking of Drax, he was the only character I liked in the film, and only Dave Bautista made the film worth watching. I didn't consider Peter Quill a hero in this film, Rocket was more annoying than funny, and Halle Berry lookalike Gamora with her avocado facial mud mask was same old, same old. At least Baby Groot was adorable.As much as I enjoyed the first film, I absolutely loathed this one. Nothing here felt or looked real. I couldn't wait for this to end!Would I watch it again? No! No-no-no-no ugh, no!",1,1,2,23 February 2020
The Da Vinci Code," Oh, how I loved this!
","There's no denying this is a very controversial film, and you either love it or hate it. I loved it! Despite the film's religious aspect that offended a lot of people when it was released (and today still) the film is a fascinating, suspenseful action adventure thriller. Credible performances from a top-notch cast make the film that much more enjoyable. Audrey Tautou is good as usual, as was Tom Hanks. The visual effects are subtle, yet very effective. I enjoyed this immensely from beginning to end!",7,0,1,1 July 2018
Titanic," Despite a lot of plot flaws and conveniences, this really is one of the best films ever made.
","Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",10,130,153,3 July 2018
Thor," Entertaining, nevertheless...
","More enjoyable than expected. Some very good visuals and photography and a subtle love story I thoroughly enjoyed. Stellan Skarsgard's character was the 'comic relief' in the film, and in my opinion would have been better without. Natalie Portman is convincing in her role and Chris Hemsworth makes for a fine, determined god. A few flaws that needed to be omitted, and I actually can't believe professionals in the industry did not see this. When they drive just 50 miles to the 'crash site' it starts off in broad daylight, but they arrive there when it is pitch dark. The security at the crash site is quite laughable, actually!I must admit, I'm not a superhero movie fan, but this was entertaining enough to keep me interested.",6,0,0,3 July 2018
The Shape of Water," An absolute masterpiece!
","There's a very good reason why Guillermo del Toro is one of my favorite directors: he is just brilliant! This film perfectly justifies the statement. It is simply put one of the most amazing and unique love stories I've ever seen. Sally Hawkins is excellent as a mute woman who's ordinary life soon turns extra-ordinary. Doug Jones is great as the creature (looking very similar to Hellboy's Abe Sapien character - also played by Doug and directed by Guillermo). The entire production was masterfully done and the visuals are awesome. This is a very special and highly effective film about the different levels of loneliness. An instant classic, and a masterpiece at that.",8,1,7,16 June 2018
Zombieland," Ugh! I absolutely HATED this!
","Having seen a few enjoyable horror comedies lately I decided to watch 'Zombieland'. Call me Hollywood-phobic, but this was one of the least enjoyable zombie films (and films in general) I've seen in a while.This film is so stereotypical American, it hurts (by the way, the box office records proof this to be true, as well. Of the $102 million the film took at the box office, $75.5 million came from Americans, and only $27 million from the rest of the world.)The film is an advertising vessel for brands like Mountain Dew, Twinkie, FedEx, Monopoly, and Bill Murray!! Yup, Bill Murray! The constant narration is distracting. The characters are annoying, and do the stupidest things - seriously! Considering they are last of a handful of survivors, they sure do act irresponsibly! The 'love interest' is just absurd, unrealistic, stupid, and annoying! So obligatory American...The whole Bill Murray episode was cringe worthy, to say the least. An egotistical display of starstruck idiocy! The film started off with relentless killings and gore, and dwindled to become a boring talkie. My gosh, I became so bored with all the talking, talking, talking.... For a film with a run time of only 88 minutes, not much meaningful happened here. Yawn.It was like a stand-up comedian with a lot of ideas, who decided to turn it into a film. To make it more commercial, he decided to throw in a few zombies. Ugh, I didn't enjoy this at all!!",1,0,0,30 May 2020
A Beautiful Mind," Well made film, but ultimately not my cup of tea.
","Regarded as one of the top rated movies, I must be honest, I was bored. Not because it is a bad movie, but because the premise simply did not interest me.Let's face it; I hated mathematics at school. So, watching a movie about a brilliant mathematician is not exactly my idea of a good time with a movie. Throw in the spy element with mystery, action and adventure, and there's a twinkling in my eye. Sadly, this was merely our hero's mind playing tricks on him. Or quite bluntly, losing his mind.Based on fact, I suppose it would not have made an interesting movie if it wasn't for John Nash's imaginary world. Once I realized it was all just his schizophrenia talking, I lost interest and it was ultimately boring. The ending was probably supposed to give me goosebumps, but unfortunately it did nothing for me. I was only toot happy it (finally) ended. This is a very long movie, and also a very slow moving one.Make no mistake, this is a very well made film with good dialogue and acting. Russell Crowe and Ed Harris in particular were very good.",4,1,4,8 January 2020
Psycho," Yes, a classic, but...
","Although I found the film compelling enough, it is obviously a bit dated. It must have been very suspenseful at the time of release, but not by today's standards. It was a bit more of a talkie - like most films of the time. I thought Anthony Perkins was exceptionally good as Norman Bates. I found the ending not very convincing as they tried to explain the Norman Bates/Mrs Bates setup. Maybe at the time it was acceptable, but I was kind of expecting more. Nevertheless, this is indeed a classic.",5,1,5,20 June 2018
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Good in its own right, but not better than the original.
","As with any sequel, it is expected to be bigger and better than the first film. 'Transformers 2' offers much more on action and CGI. Although it was maybe a bit too CGI-heavy, it goes with the territory considering the nature of the film, and was still thrilling to watch.The impressive action-packed opening sequence set the standard for what was to come. Once again, the visuals are incredible. The story continues as the Decepticons learn of a shard of the Allspark Cube remaining still, and they'll do anything to get it. Naturally, chaos and mayhem follow as the Decepticons destroys much of the cities around the world. And boy, Michael Bay does enjoy destroying things!!Most of the original cast is back to reprise there roles, which I enjoyed. It was not as suspenseful as the original, as this film has a lot more humor. The Transformer twins were just stupid as the comic relief characters and it would have been so much better without them. The library scene was really great, and the desert attack scene in Egypt was simply awesome! The action is insane! I must be honest, though, I enjoyed the first film much more.",6,1,1,12 May 2019
The Witch," Oh wow!!
","All I'd like to say about this film, is that it was completely and utterly fantastic! This is almost as perfect a film as one could get. It was eerie, unpredictable and very disturbing. The acting was superb. The film cleverly does not make use of visual effects and instead substitutes it with dark and foreboding forests, sheds and homes. This greatly enhances the tension and makes it more credible. The scene where Thomasin surrenders to witchcraft and becomes overjoyed and blissful as she transforms into a witch is rather disturbing - even more so since this scene was also done without CGI effects.",7,1,2,20 June 2018
Zero Dark Thirty," Very good film, but...
","Based on fact, there's no question about the importance of this being told. And there's no denying this is a brilliant film. The entire cast was very good and the film incredibly well made, and very believable. In fact, there's very little I can fault here - except for the final act: the film's most crucial moments were so dark that one could hardly make out what was going on. The entire film revolves around finding Osama Bin Laden, and when that moment finally arrived, I sat there thinking 'was that it?' Maybe that's the way it really happened, but it didn't really translate well dramatically into film. It was still a very good film, though, but must agree this is the type of film I won't rush into another viewing.",7,0,1,27 August 2018
War of the Worlds," Spectacular, non-stop action
","The classic tale gets a fresh new look thanks to dynamic visuals. This is still one of Tom Cruise's best performances (in my opinion) and Dakota Fanning is also very good.The visuals are jaw-dropping. The action and suspense starts pretty early in the film and never lets up. This is non-stop action and excitement from beginning to end, with lots of suspense and great sound effects.Yes, there were scenes when I thought this is absolutely not possible, and it wasn't always believable how Ray (Cruise) managed to escape the onslaught, but in general this is one hell of an awesome action thriller. Spielberg thought of everything to maximize the suspense. 'War of the Worlds' is a an all-round top-notch production.",7,0,2,5 December 2019
30 Days of Night," A bloody thrill-ride!
","Awesome scenery. Great atmosphere. Great premise and setting. This was really freaky! There is just so much happening within the first 20 minutes of this film alone that one doesn't even get a chance to catch your breath. There's no false scares here; these are all REAL scares. It was genuinely frightening at times, also thanks to incredible make-up effects. As the film progressed, it also became action-packed with nail biting suspense. This was easily one of the most interesting and exciting vampire films I've seen. One thing, though, why did the vampires resort to seemingly senseless killing instead of just quenching their thirst? Or did they intend killing as many as possible as food stock? But then the blood doesn't stay fresh. Just a thought, but otherwise the film was quite a thrill-ride!",6,0,0,20 June 2018
Sausage Party," I absolutely hated this.
","Be careful telling your kids all animated films are ok to watch. This is strictly adults only and even then, not for the faint-hearted it seems! Completely and utterly stupid and inappropriate. Whoever came up with a demented idea like this? If you made it past the logline and actually started watching the film, good luck seeing it through to the end. How many f words can you cram into one movie?",1,2,4,1 July 2018
Ice Age," Still one of my favorite animated films!
","Oh wow, this was simply awesome! From the animation to the great premise, this was an exciting and funny action adventure ride. This beautiful film has it all: humor that is really funny, thrilling action and adventure, wonderful characters and voice overs. The humor is brilliantly original and never really slapstick.The film also features much darker elements like double crossing, scheming, and evil plans of revenge. There are also very sincere and emotional moments, like a mother willing to sacrifice everything to save her child, a mammoth longing for a family, and a villain becoming a hero. The cute factor is evident throughout the film, and the characters steal your heart every step of the way. The squirrel, Scrat, is just lovable and adorable!! I love the satirical elements, as well, as they illustrate why the Dodo became extinct...! This was awesome!",8,1,1,25 August 2019
Joker," Well made and Joaquin is fantastic (!), but is it worth they hype??
","Ah, yes, 'Joker' - one of the most anticipated and highest acclaimed films of 2019. Does it deserve to be? Who am I to argue if it was such a huge box office success?It doesn't mean I have to agree, though. I can't help but wonder whether this would have been as successful if it was a standalone movie instead of a Batman prequel, and the fact that the audience were familiar with the Joker character.Unlike the Batman films, this is not a fantasy film. This is a drama - a rather slow moving drama, with great moments here and there. There were times when I actually found the film boring, tedious even. It wasn't a particularly special story, although it was interesting to see how Joker came to be. What made the film worth watching, was Joaquin Phoenix's incredibly chilling performance. (although all the laughing became annoying after a while). He certainly deserves an Oscar for this.The film has a good ending. In general, I don't believe the film is worthy of the hype. It just wasn't that spectacular (or not for me, at least).",6,1,3,18 December 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Well made, but too much of a talkie for my liking... (Nicholson is excellent, though!)
","'One flew over the cuckoo's nest' is regarded among the best movies ever made, so I finally decided to watch it, even though the trailer did nothing for my senses.Having seen it now, neither did the film, actually. The acting from the entire cast is absolutely brilliant, especially Jack Nicholson, but sadly this could not save the film for me. I found it dragging with too much talking and too little happening. Yes, it is a very well made film. Yes, it was interesting to see how the criminal (Nicholson) changed everyone's lives and added life to their otherwise monotonous existence. Nevertheless, I'm not fond of talkies, and also found the film just too long to remain interesting.Somehow the film also seems pointless in the end. The film revolves around proving whether the criminal is insane or not, but they never follow through on this...",5,0,2,14 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Incredible action. Wow, Tom Cruise's acting is outstanding in this film!
","An idea that could have been tedious and dull ended up being rather exciting, thanks to clever editing and good pacing. Very little about Cage (Tom Cruise) going into combat is believable, but once he was there it didn't matter. Wow, Cruise's acting is incredible in this film! He really sold the idea to me and I believed every moment he relived, again and again. More information is revealed every time. It was like a game where you try to advance to the next level every time you play.The visual effects are amazing and the action fast-paced. I enjoyed the fact the film wasn't riddled with silly humor Hollywood films of this genre is known for. It remained serious throughout with a hint of humor here and there, that actually were funny.",7,0,0,30 November 2018
Downfall," Well made film, but not entirely my cup of tea...
","'Downfall' is indeed a very well made film, but I fear the film's appeal might be limited to those interested in history only - specifically Hitler. It was interesting to see a film about the powerful, ruthless Hitler's final moments, where he has lost all hope in winning the war.Hitler is portrayed as an emotional person who even shows regret and compassion, and not the tyrant he was. Yes, he has his outbursts, but one might even feel sorry for him in this film (only if you're not familiar with his history, off course). Although he remained stubborn until the very end, this once powerful dictator - the devil himself - died cowardly by his own hand. May he rot in hell for all eternity! (Bruno Ganz was excellent as Adolf Hitler).Ultimately, the film was too much of a talkie with very little action. Note, this is not a war movie in the true sense, and with a running time of 156 minutes, it was a bit of a drag.",6,0,4,29 November 2019
Whiplash," One of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure of watching!
","The film is probably best enjoyed by musicians or jazz enthusiasts. This is an acquired taste. There is no denying JK Simmons gave an Oscar-winning performance, and yes, the editing was Oscar-worthy as well. But for most parts of the film I can't say it was a pleasure watching this. I can still enjoy a bad horror B-movie, but certainly not this. I did not agree with Fletcher's teaching methods, as it was total abuse. This movie should be used as educational material for methods teachers should NOT use. It was disgusting - to say the least - how he treated and spoke to the youngsters. In fact, so much so it should be considered a crime. There was not a single moment of the film I enjoyed. On the contrary, this horrible movie is one of the most hated films I've ever seen. Why has it been voted one of the best films ever???
Note: I rated the film 1/10 not because it is a badly made movie. It's a very well made movie, but I just did not enjoy it at all, hence the low rating.",1,4,9,5 July 2018
Con Air," One of my favorite action films.
","This was the time when Nicolas Cage's movies were still entertaining and good fun. I found myself really rooting for him in this film thanks to the back story. John Malkovich was just BRILLIANT in his role - probably one of the best antagonists ever. Although I generally like John Cusack, I did not find him believable enough in his role. Sadly. The action scenes are insanely good. I also loved the cinematography. The excellent photography very cleverly and effectively builds suspense. The dialogue was also very good. The humor elements blended very well with the action, drama and suspense and never became annoying. This was top notch entertainment and a fun movie to watch. The ending was awesome! Where have you ever seen a plane land on the Las Vegas strip? There was just so much happening all at once with sparks and debris flying all over, and total destruction and mayhem. And even then it was still not over. Wow, time to catch my breath now. This is without a doubt one of my favorite action films.",7,1,1,10 June 2018
Con Air," One of my favorite action movies.
","Interesting and exciting action adventure with destruction and explosions galore. John Malkkovich is brilliant as antagonist Cyrus the Virus. The final scene is quite exhilarating, actually, when the plane lands on the busy Las Vegas Strip.",7,1,2,2 July 2018
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Another enjoyable action adventure.
","More new characters are being introduced in this installment. Manny's daughter is all grown up and the film now also effectively illustrates a lot of teenage issues teenagers can relate to. The age old desire to 'be cool' and 'fit in' is so well demonstrated.In the opening scene of the first 'Ice Age', Sid wakes up with his family having deserted him. We finally meet his family in this film, although only for a while, and clearly understands why they left without him in the first place. We also meet his Granny - a wonderful (ugly) character!! Granny is a completely different character to the rest of the gang and a fantastic addition to the franchise.The film is filled with lots of action, adventure and intrigue, and features a great antagonist - the first real antagonist in the series - the Pirate Captain Gutt. Diego also finally meets another Sabre Tiger. I really enjoyed this installment, as well. This was another great action adventure thrill ride.",6,1,1,27 August 2019
The Mission," One of the most boring movies.
",Yawn...(enough said)...At least the score by Ennio Morricone was great.,2,5,13,3 July 2018
The Green Mile," Just stunning on every level.
","Simply brilliant! A very different Stephen King film, and very special indeed! The film touches you on so many levels. It is both funny and dramatic, and simply spellbinding. Although it has a long running time, the film is never boring. With an exceptional cast, special mention must go to Doug Hutchison. He is fantastic! You can't help hating him with a passion, and then rejoices when the dog gets his day! Michael Clarke Duncan is also an absolute delight!",8,0,0,3 July 2018
Jaws," The best shark film EVER!!
","This is still one of the best shark films ever made. It is still so realistic by today's standards that it must have been insanely frightening at the time. I bet this caused bathers to think twice before going into the water! A brilliant cast, brilliant directing and visuals ensure a convincing film that has stood the test of time. Suspenseful, action-packed, dramatic and even quite funny at times, this is a perfect blend of all these genres. Well done, Steven Spielberg!I recently acquired this on Blu Ray and it was simply incredible!!! The restored film is crystal clear and looks as if it was made just yesterday. This is definitely best viewed on Blu Ray.",10,0,2,2 July 2018
Hancock," Well, at least the visuals were good...
","Hollywood's inclination to cause as much destruction as possible in their superhero films is taken to the extreme in this over the top silly film. I generally enjoy Will Smith, but he's really bad here - maybe because he wasn't given anything decent to do. As much as I'd like to forget this film, I won't because I'll always remember how bad it was.Great visuals, though.",3,2,4,21 June 2018
12 Strong," Awesome!!
","The film grips you from the opening and doesn't let go until the awesome final showdown. Anyone who has had to endure the agony of 9/11 will understand the importance of this film. I'm not familiar with the war that followed, which the film is about, so naturally I can't comment on the authenticity, but from an entertainment perspective this was tense and exciting. The actors were very good and credible, the action scenes were jaw-dropping, and the music was also highly effective. The photography and cinematography is great, with some stunning aerial shots. The characters are very likable, making me root for all of them. This is an awesome action adventure with a magnificent climax.",8,0,1,8 August 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Incredible visuals; lame story.
","Some amazing shots, but ultimately still not better than the Peter Jackson version. Some effects are very obvious CGI and Blue Screen, similar to a 60's movie of this genre. Samuel L Jackson's character completely ruins the movie. It is just not believable that anyone would act the way he does given the circumstances they find themselves in. Even worse is that the party actually obeys! For what reason would scientists obey a government official if they have nothing to gain by doing so? The beautiful 'love' story between a giant ape and human King Kong is known for, has for some reason been excluded from this version. The King Kong magic is gone. Maybe, hopefully, this will materialize in a sequel...I just don't know if I'd be interested in seeing a sequel...",5,0,1,3 July 2018
The Lion King," Words can't describe how good and special this film is.
","Oh, this simply has to be the greatest animation film ever. The film features a host of interesting, lovable characters and a fantastic plot, with a few lessons to be learnt in there, as well. The musical element in the film is entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable. The animation is wonderful for its time, and the voice overs are done by an exceptional cast, in particular Whoopi Goldberg and Jeremy Irons.This is one to watch again and again, but be sure to have some tissues handy, as well, as the film will make you just as emotional at times as it will make you cry with laughter! The film also has a fantastic score, courtesy of Hans Zimmer.",10,1,1,1 July 2018
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Awesome on every level!
","The first thing I noticed was the awesome music. The film doesn't waste any time getting to the action. The characters are very likable, making you root for them. This was a very different war film, concentrating more on the relationship between two brothers - being very close prior to war and then having nothing in common once at the war front. Make no mistake, this was brutal, graphic and disturbing. The film so effectively shows how war changes people, as one of the brothers rises from ordinary man to the nation's hero, and how it affects those around him.The Koreans make the best war films by far, and this film is undeniable proof! The battle scenes are incredibly well done and very realistic. The final battle scene is fantastic! This is a very sad film, though, but my goodness, this was good!",8,0,0,4 June 2018
Finding Dory," Good, but with a sense of deja vu.
","Let's face it, a sequel very seldom is as good as the original. Although the animation was equally great and the lovable characters are back, I did get a sense of deja vu here. It was pretty much an 'Oh, I've seen this before' feeling. Although Dory, who was my favorite character in 'Finding Nemo', is now the main character, the plot seems all too familiar. It was nevertheless enjoyable, though.",6,0,1,1 July 2018
Arrival," Classy, but going nowhere slowly.
","This is a classy, thorough and very realistic piece of work. It has great acting and dialogue. Music is kept to a minimum and subtle elements add greatly to build suspense. The spaceships are also very simplistic. Be forewarned, though, this is not your typical alien invasion movie. This gets a bit boring after the halfway mark as nothing really actually happens. This is pretty much a talkie that finally leaves you wondering what the purpose of everything was.",5,1,7,20 June 2018
The Cannonball Run," (Mindless) Fun action comedy...
","This felt like an extended 'Smokey and the Bandit' storyline, or a spinoff, especially with Burt Reynolds back in the saddle and a similar story with regards to the girl joining him. Indeed very similar. It was nevertheless a fun (if mindless) action comedy. I really enjoyed Roger Moore in the film as well as the James Bond reference.The film's ending give us the impression the winner is the first person to cross the finish line, but this is not the case. Before the race, each contestant punched their cards. The winner is determined by the time it took them to finish the race, so the first one to cross the finish line is not necessarily the winner. A significant amount of time passed from the time the first contestant left until JJ McClure's (Burt Reynolds) team left. The girls in the Lamborghini also left well before McClure's team, yet they end up together at the finish line and then race to cross it. If they ended up at the finish line together, then surely McClure wins, regardless of the girls crossing the line first, as they finished in less time. The race for the finish line at the end is therefore pointless.Although this was an enjoyable film I'd rather watch 'Smokey and the Bandit' ten times over than giving this a second viewing.",4,0,2,9 September 2018
Parasite," Wow, just wow!
","'Parasite' can be summarized in a single word: WOW!Director Joon-ho Bong brought us the incredible films 'Memories of Murder', 'The Host', 'Mother', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', and now 'Parasite'. Starting out as a comedy, the film soon reveals itself for what it truly is. This brilliant script has an ingenious set-up, morphing into a full-on, devious thriller.Initially innocent, the antagonist family's plan soon becomes evident as they infiltrate the lives of an unsuspecting wealthy family. At first through subtle, seemingly innocent actions, but becoming increasingly more sinister as their plans fall into place. The film has a few interesting twists. Kang-ho Song is excellent as usual. He is an incredibly versatile actor. I've seen him in comedies, action movies, horrors and thrillers and he simply never disappoints.The setting in the big mansion is really awesome, versus the dilapidated neighborhood the antagonist family comes from. The behavioral differences are also very effectively illustrated. Although some moments might be considered too convenient to be realistic, the execution thereof is excellent, making this yet another classic, unforgettable Korean thriller.",8,0,4,29 October 2019
Centurion," It might have worked with a better script and more interesting characters.
","I don't know exactly what it is that made me not enjoy the film as much as I had hoped I would. Maybe because it felt like it was trying to be like '300' (2006) or 'Pathfinder' (2007), but without the incredible visuals and photography.'Centurion' certainly was better than 'Pathfinder' but not nearly as good or interesting as '300'. It was fast-paced with lots of action, good cinematography, and good acting, yet it still lacked something, and I can't quite put my finger on it. It was incredibly brutal, bloody and gory - but then again so was '300', and I loved that movie. Maybe it was just too barbaric, and I didn't quite enjoy the characters. None of them really stood out for me, not even Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) as the hero. There was nothing special about him. He kept surviving attacks because every time luck was on his side, not because he was a strategist, or good fighter, or even clever enough to outsmart the enemy.The main protagonist was Etain, but I didn't buy her character and I didn't feel Olga Kurylenko did the character justice. She was just trying too hard. And then there's the other antagonist, Gorlacon. His army is in pursuit of Quintus' legion because his son was killed by one of them, but Gorlacon simply vanishes from the script towards the end. What, no reckoning???Don't get me wrong, this is not a badly made film. I just don't like it.",4,0,4,28 February 2020
Halloween," And so a franchise starts...
","The score lends the film a constant foreboding atmosphere, without which the film might not have worked so well. 'Halloween' has a very simple plot with average dialogue, and not-so-good acting (note I didn't say bad). The only reason - I assume - it was such a huge success, is because of this simple premise and because the film bears the name of one of America's favorite holidays. And due to Jamie Lee's likability, off course.It must have been scary at the time, but unfortunately no longer by today's standards. At times the characters do the stupidest things that people wouldn't normally do given the circumstances. Yet still, this is a classic horror that might have started the slasher genre (although this is not really a slasher film).",5,0,2,7 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Much better than expected superhero action drama.
","I must be honest, it took me a while before I finally decided to watch this, as I'm not a big Hollywood superhero movie fan. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Gil Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and lends credibility to the naive title character. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was wonderful and made for a very believable love story. It felt very natural and romance between them seemed inevitable.As for the plot, I enjoyed the way the Amazonian women's back story was told, as well as Diana's (Wonder Woman). The visuals and photography are incredible! This is a visual spectacle. I loved the humorist dialogue, which was genuinely funny and never over the top or slapstick. Gil Gadot is just fabulous.This superhero movie had a very realistic feel to it with the added bonus of feeling and emotion. There are so many truths in this film humanity should take note of. The film has a very unexpected ending compared to most superhero movies, and that's what I honestly loved about the film.",8,3,4,10 August 2018
The Queen," Not impressed.
","Winning numerous awards and hailed by critics, I was not as impressed with the film. It did give an interesting insight into the Monarchy, and the effect Diana's death had on the world - Britain especially. The Monarchy (in my opinion) serves a tourist purpose only and has long since lost the reigning power as it used to be. This film proves it. The 'etiquette' towards the Queen should long since have been abolished. She is a mere person and not a god, and it is frustrating to see how they revel in luxury and opulence at the expense of the general public.Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was mostly comical in the beginning of the film, removing every inch of drama and feeling she possibly tried to convey. Prince Charles was a very weak character, while Prince Philip was bombastic. The only strong character for me was Michael Sheen as Tony Blair. Even Helen McCrory as his wife, Cherie, was for most of the film annoying.The film did nothing for my senses and the real life footage was more interesting than the film itself.",4,2,4,17 September 2018
The Woman in Black," Freaky, creepy and effective
","Spine-chilling from beginning to end! The suspense simply never lets up. The atmosphere and subtle effects are awesome. Truly nail bitingly brilliant! I absolutely loved the ending, too.",6,0,1,28 June 2018
X-Men: First Class," Very entertaining. Fassbender steals the show!!
","So, this is where it all began. This prequel shows us how Professor Xavier (and others) came to be. It's no secret, I'm no superhero movie fan, but I do enjoy the X-Men films and characters. I enjoy the way the characters can be humble, vulnerable and emotional. It sets itself apart from other superhero movies in that respect.Michael Fassbender steals the show as young Erik, who would become Magneto. He simply is sensational in this film. James McAvoy stars as Charles Xavier and does the character justice, as well. The film's visual effects are amazing!The film might not be as action-packed as the original Trilogy, but it is nevertheless entertaining and very exciting. 'First Class' also sends out a very strong message of acceptance in society.",7,1,1,22 April 2019
Black Panther," Preposterous plot with very bad acting.
","Ok, seriously, Hollywood, what was the 'under the table' deal for this film to win so many awards?? The film suffers from bad acting (yet it won awards for acting), bad accents (most annoying!!), plot flaws deluxe, conveniences like you've never seen before, and inconsistent visual effects (yet it won awards for visual effects).I've heard a lot of negative reviews about the the film and went in with an open mind. I wanted to like the film, but hence, there was nothing to enjoy here. None of the actors, or characters, were believable. The plot and dialogue is terrible. The technology and inventions are outrageously silly (almost laughable). I can't get over how BAD the acting was, as if none of the actors truly believed in the film and therefore showed very little enthusiasm. The attempts at humor left very little to be desired. It was just corny and completely out of place. I also did not enjoy their racism remarks like 'Great! Another broken white boy to fix.' I wonder how many times I yawned or rolled my eyes during the first 30 minutes of the film... They also certainly know how to waste time in this film...Ok, some spoilers. In the beginning, Black Panther drinks a potion to strip him of his strength (as they did numerous times during the film in order to make him more vulnerable - how stupid!). Why did they even bother writing this scene where he is being challenged as king? It was so obvious he would win. Why would Ulysses agree to meet in a casino (of all places!!) to do his deal? (Oh, and Andy Serkis was so bad as Ulysses, I think he should rather stick to monkey business!). Nothing about this scene was believable. During all the fighting and shooting, you see a few people running about, but there's no panic. Even the bloody extras were bad!!Also, during the entire film Black Panther doesn't act like a king and no-one respects him like one. He is a very timid, pushover of a character. No back bone! Later, when Erik Killmonger challenges Black Panther and they fight, he throws Black Panther off the cliff, and then proudly proclaims he is the new king. He is then immediately crowned King. What!!!??? No-one even bothers confirming the Black Panther - their reigning king - is really dead??? They don't even bother to go look for him, find him, bury him??? Wow, that's loyalty towards your king!! If this was a silly kids cartoon it might have been acceptable but certainly not in a big budget film like this! This was just preposterous!!By the time the decent action arrived during the climax, I couldn't wait for the film to end. The climatic fight between Erik and Black Panther was also so painfully cliched and predictable - and then suddenly emotional (????!!!). 'Black Panther' toys with the viewer's emotions, but sadly this film didn't do anything for any of my senses. I hated this!",1,5,7,24 April 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," This CGI heavy actioner might not appeal to everyone...
","Wow, so much happens within the first 30 minutes! Henry Cavill really is awesome as Superman. Having flopped as a superhero in 'Daredevil', Ben Affleck returns as a superhero - this time as Batman.The film has amazing visuals, but is also CGI heavy. The fight scenes are maybe overlong and overdone, yet still exciting. Its incredible that, in a 3-hour movie, there never was a dull moment. What a massive undertaking this film must have been. It is a non-stop display of action and CGI. The ending was a bit too much CGI, making it hard to conceive as realistic. The final hour literally is just one very long fight sequence. The film playes like a real-life cartoon. With so much happening in one film, I wonder if I will actually remember everything that happened. Maybe they should have streamlined the film a bit.If you're looking for action and CGI in abundance, then 'Batman v Superman' is for you. If not, well, then you might want to give this one a skip...",6,0,1,24 December 2019
Blade Runner," Yawn, is it over yet?
","An hour into the film characters were still being introduced and I was still waiting for something to happen. I found it insanely slow moving and utterly boring. If the logline doesn't sound confusing enough, the film will indeed proof it is! The film was a box office failure and its easy too see why.",2,5,12,2 July 2018
The Greatest Showman," A True masterpiece!!
","Impressive directorial debut from Michael Gracey. This showstopper spectacle is nothing short of a masterpiece! Fascinating and utterly spectacular, this is instantly one of my favorite musicals. Hugh Jackman is also simply brilliant as usual. If the film's opening wasn't spectacular enough, the film never ceases to amaze. The photography and visuals are stunning and the music awesome! This is a top-notch production close to perfect on every level.",9,1,4,10 June 2018
Casino Royale," Another modern Bond let-down.
","Somtimes, it seems, film makers (especially American) think they can shove whatever they want down our throats and we're going to swallow! Such is the case with 'Casino Royale' (or any other James Bond film for that matter). Isn't it amazing how Bond can walk into any place on earth and know exactly where to find what he is looking for?? In Casino Royale he simply waltzes into a 5-Star hotel's UNMANNED security room, easily finds a tape he's looking for and then finds what's he's looking for on the tape within seconds. Seriously?!? And they expect be to believe $120million can easily be withdrawn in cash (mind you!) WITHOUT any security measurements, and without the account holder present??? Bond's sports car crashes at high speed and rolls about ten times, yet the next day he walks about without even limping!! Ya-a-awn.... This is why films like King Kong are more believable: they were intended to be fantasy films where reality can be thrown overboard.
James Bond films (Transporter, Fast & Furious, ANY Marvel superhero film, etc,) substitute credibility for effect. Even these 'effective' action sequences can be terribly daunting to watch if they are senseless.
Some credit due to Casino Royale, though, the action scenes are much more believable than the crap they write into the latest Fast & Furious films. And - apart from being absolutely dashing - Daniel Craig makes a credible Bond. (Oh, and the love interest scenes in Casino Royale were absolutely pathetic and so blatantly forced, it hurts.) Bond is a Casanova, keep it that way!",3,3,6,3 July 2018
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," One word: AWESOME!!
","All our favorite characters - including the new ones introduced in 'Ice Age 2' - are back for yet another adventure. It was delightful to see the new characters were not as annoying as in 'Ice Age 2'.This installment plays like an 'Ice Age' vs 'Journey to the center of the Earth' meets 'Jurassic Park' - and its stunning! The element of danger is back, and - just like the first film - this one includes various genres including action, adventure, suspense, and humor that is actually funny - all at the appropriate time. The animation is stunning.Scrat once again serves up a generous portion of fun and humor. The Tango scene is simply awesome!! (wonder how many times I watched this scene...). While other characters fall in love, Scrat still only has eyes for his beloved acorn. So funny! And then there's Sid, who discovers his Mother's instincts in this film... oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...This was an amazing action adventure thrill ride that will appeal to young and old. Who doesn't like dinosaurs, and an unconventional rescue party...!",7,1,1,27 August 2019
Signs," Very restraint, very enjoyable.
","'Signs' is a very reserved and restraint sci-fi movie, and will no doubt not fulfill everyone's needs in an alien movie.This is not an alien-driven movie, though. Instead, it revolves more around how people - or one family in particular - reacts to news of an alien invasion. The film has a constant sense of mystery with an eerie feeling to it. It is also funny at times, without trying to be comedic. I found it interesting from start to finish, with a few nice suspenseful moments in there as well. Good script.The child actors are very good, and I thought Mel Gibson was good, as well. I enjoyed this.",6,1,1,1 April 2020
Beowulf," Beautiful, gory, sensual.
","The film has a very unique look to it. At times the animation actually looks real. This is maybe due to the fact that this is not completely animated. Instead, they used real actors, similar to 'The Polar Express'. In fact, Robert Zemeckis did 'The Polar Express' and 'Beowulf' back to back.The film is bloody and gory, yet also has very deep emotion. It is a great story, and a wonderful epic action adventure fantasy horror. The actors did a great job, and the film is visually stunning. The film was also very sensual, focusing on both the male and female physique. Beowulf has a body to be admired.If you've purchased the Blu Ray or DVD, be sure to watch the special features. 'The Making of' is fascinating.",7,1,1,23 May 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Awesome!
","Oh, what an absolutely unique and delightful film! This is just pure genius! The stop-motion animation is great, the plot is great, the characters are wonderful, the score by Alexandre Desplat is awesome. In the traditional Wes Anderson style, the film makes use of color and interesting props, and unique camera angles. Wes Anderson has such a unique way telling his stories, its quite marvelous, actually, and a delight to watch.",7,3,4,24 December 2018
Speed," Awesome action!
","As so aptly indicated by its title, the film is fast-paced! Thrilling and exciting from beginning to end with some amazing action sequences, and great suspense, as well. Awesome music and a great cast. This is a thrill-ride deluxe!",8,1,1,1 July 2018
X2: X-Men United," Just as exciting as the first film.
","Just as classy a sci-fi fantasy film as the first installment. However, I found this installment overlong with too many stories all in one to such an extent that I sometimes forgot about some of the characters and what they were up to. Nevertheless a fantastic film and very enjoyable action adventure. Hugh Jackman steals the show once again.",7,1,1,2 July 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Huge disappointment.
","Unfortunately, a disappointment. The magic moments of the first film made place for a CGI-loaded surreal world without depth and emotion. There are so many 'conveniences' and the film is laden with flaws that it is simply not believable. Some effects are great and some are not - just as inconsistent as the story!Quite forgettable, actually.",3,2,4,3 July 2018
Amélie," An all time favorite!!
","A feel-good movie everyone should see! The film conveys a positive message that leaves you feeling warm inside. This was an absolute pleasure to watch, and quite frankly, they type of film I can watch again and again because it just makes you feel so good! Brilliant acting. Brilliant plot, excellently executed. Audrey Tautou is at her best!",10,2,3,3 July 2018
Final Destination," A classic is born!
","Ahhh, a classic horror film. The slasher films are back (then again, did they ever leave?). 'Final Destination' is an interesting concept where Death itself is the antagonist in a slasher film.After an impressive opening, the film gets more freaky. All the characters die in freak accidents, and - come to think of it - is actually so possible. For these youngsters, death is sure to knock on the door. Even though we expect it, some deaths are very unexpected - if you know what I mean - and quite shocking. The execution (pardon the pun!) of the plot is interesting and rather thrilling. The very idea of cheating death is alluring.Even more interesting, is when the characters realize they will die in the order of which they were supposed to die. Paying attention to signs all around you might save your life, but then death moves on to the next person in line, until it is your turn again, and again you have to try and outwit it. Very clever premise indeed!The film is atmospheric and foreboding, with disaster lurking around every corner. The cast is pretty good and convincing, and so are the visual effects. The action sequences are also very well done. A great amount of detail went into the making of this film.",7,2,2,24 April 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The perfect horror! What a classic!
","Thanks to Wes Craven's vision of the ultimate villain, he created one of the greatest horror films ever. Robert England portrayed antagonist Freddy Krueger so convincingly that this menacing character was bound to give us nightmares for years to come. In a time before CGI was so commonly used, the visual and special effects were incredible, perfectly conveying the nightmare world of the victims. The idea of a ruthless killer killing teenagers in their sleep is scary enough; now add blades for fingers, a constant foreboding atmosphere, scary music and suspense and a classic is born. Constantly nominated as one of the best horror films.",9,1,1,2 July 2018
The Truman Show," Very good, although not entirely my cup of tea.
","Regarded as one of the top rated movies, I was curious to see what made it so good. Knowing the premise, I was interested to see how they were going to justify the story.The film is actually incredibly well set-up, explaining in detail how it was possible for Truman to never explore the world. Jim Carrey is also perfectly cast as Truman, and he completely sold his character to me in a not-so-over-the-top comedic and also somewhat dramatic performance. The more I watched, the more addicted I became - like a soapie. This was the whole idea of the movie and it effectively came across as such.Ed Harris is also great in his role as the film's antagonist. 'The Truman Show' is an interesting concept, and they manage to pull it off perfectly. The film also has a beautiful score. Good ending.",6,1,1,16 October 2019
Godzilla," Better than expected.
","Since I did not enjoy the 1998 version, this film wasn't really on my list of films to see. It was therefore a very impulsive decision to watch this. And I'm glad I did, as I was really impressed.I was so grateful the film didn't have any annoying comic relief characters or annoying arrogant characters, which is very unusual for Hollywood blockbuster films. This was serious all the way, and was refreshing for this genre. In fact, I really enjoyed and rooted for all the characters. Bryan Cranston was excellent. Aaron Taylor-Johnson wasn't strong enough in the role of the hero, Ford, but he was very likable. Also, I think maybe the film was so much better because they didn't use any big shot Hollywood actors (think Dwayne Johnson) in the lead roles.The visual effects are very good. It's just a pity so much of the visuals were so dark - almost black and white, especially towards the end. Although I enjoyed the film and it was an unexpected surprise, I probably won't be watching it again in a hurry, but I'm certainly glad I did.",6,0,0,26 April 2019
Life," Nothing we haven't seen before, but very well made.
","Judging by the casting, they obviously had very high hopes for this film. Just like every shark film is bound to be compared with 'Jaws', this type of film will no doubt be compared with 'Alien'.Ok, so what would make me decide to watch this instead of 'Alien'? Or 'Aliens', which I actually found better than the original. Actually, nothing. I'd rather watch 'Alien/s'. There's very little originality here, and it pretty much follows the same recipe as so many other films we've seen. The acting is very good, though, and the visual effects are excellent. I also enjoyed the score. (I did find Ryan Reynolds a bit of a waste in this film. Apparently he was supposed to be the lead, but couldn't due to other engagements).'Life' is a very well made film, which - if it wasn't for 'Alien/s' - could have been a genre defining film. It is suspenseful, dramatic, and action-packed - despite the confined space. We're given enough time to get to know and like the characters before chaos ensues. The film has a very effective, unexpected ending.",5,0,0,23 March 2020
Cloud Atlas," Well made, but over-complicated.
","Does anyone understand this film the first time round? Or at least the first half of the film until you realize the six different storylines actually intertwines. At first, it is awfully confusing with the same actors portraying very different characters in different time periods. Also, with so many characters I easily forget about some of them and what they were up to, with the jumping backwards of forwards between stories and timelines. It is an interesting concept, though, but a heck of a lot to digest. The actors does a brilliant job, especially Tom Hanks. The make-up and visual effects are incredible, the music awesome. I loved how the individual stories ended, although I must admit I did not see the one impacting the other, apart from the fact all the stories had the same theme: cry for freedom.As the film contains so many genres, it really is difficult categorizing it. It is essentially a love story, comedy, drama, sci-fi, action adventure...",5,0,2,28 June 2018
300," A one of a kind, very entertaining film.
","The crystal clear super slow motion capture is just as revolutionary as the effects were in 'The Matrix' at the time. Whether you love or hate the film, it is worth watching for the photography and visuals alone. The film is indeed very graphic at times, but also feature some of the greatest eye candy we've seen in a long time! The film is fast-paced and exciting and a feast for all the senses.",7,1,2,3 July 2018
Annihilation," This one will make you think...
","The first thing you notice about 'Annihilation' is the stunning visuals, and then how very different this film is to mainstream sci-fi movies. Lena (Portman) is by far the strongest character and the most likable, maybe because she's in it for very different reasons than the others. She's in it for revenge and to find answers. For the other characters it is just a mission. Once inside the Shimmer it gets really interesting. The film's color is just so brilliant! Inside the Shimmer, we experience what appears to be the next step in evolution, only much faster than is scientifically possible. The Shimmer is creating a New Earth, a perfect world the way it was supposed to be before Man intervened. Notice how the film constantly shows cell splitting - from the opening scene until the end. This is essentially what is happening here, in my opinion: the Shimmer is Earths way of 'splitting cells', thus creating the new world. This was completely and utterly beautiful and food for thought. I can't help but wonder 'What if...'.As the film progresses, we see nature start to inhabit the human DNA, the human voice and even human behavior to a certain extent, yet it is clear the new world has no place for humans, and therefore will try to annihilate them. The Shimmer was supposed to be the beginning of this annihilation, but as we later discover Man once again destroys nature. By obtaining a blood sample from Lena, the Shimmer splits these cells and creates a new human specimen, only more superior, as it mirrors Lena in her actions and even thought. This completes the next step in evolution. In this new world, everything is connected in perfect harmony, though, so when the core of this world is destroyed, the new world is now being annihilated. But ultimately - as is the custom with nature - it finds a way to sustain. I won't spoil the ending, but it was absolutely awesome!",7,0,2,10 June 2018
Incredibles 2," Better than the original.
","I'm a big fan of animated movies. I didn't really like 'The Incredibles' that much, though, and initially wasn't interested in the sequel. I suppose the media hype and box office figures finally convinced me to watch it. I'm glad I did.'The Incredibles 2' is so much better than its predecessor. It is bolder, funnier, more adventurous and more action-packed. And I simply loved the baby, Jack-Jack. He was my favorite character in the movie and I believe his character is strong enough to create a spin-off. The animation is very good, and the action sequences are fast-paced and well done. It is also a coming-of-age story with the kids Violet and Dash growing up. We saw a very different side to the Father, Bob, as well, which almost made him look like an everyday kinda Dad.I definitely liked this one better. It was very exciting, actually.",6,0,2,17 May 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the best war films.
","Hats off to Mel Gibson for a brilliantly realistic film! Andrew Garfield is sensational in his role! Inspirational, fantastic, awesome!! The battle scenes are heart wrenching and emotional. Easily the best war film I've ever seen.",9,1,2,1 July 2018
Warcraft," Yawn...
","What I really liked about the film was...uhm, erm...(Yawn) what was I saying? Was it the visual effects? A resounding no, as it was so overdone, I might have well been watching the game. The acting? Nope, unconvincing. The story? Ya-a-a-awn. The dialogue? Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha!! I'm not really sure what to make of this film. It was entertaining, I suppose, on a certain level, but in general I just didn't like it. The 'love story' was so utterly pathetic and annoying. And what's with the Biblical Moses 'child-in-basket' moment??? THAT was laughable. I mean seriously?!The film ends with an obvious hope for a sequel (also alternatively being called Warcraft: The Beginning), but I'm not sure I'd like to see it.",3,2,2,11 June 2018
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Even if its just the for action and incredible visuals...
","Almost the entire cast is back for another action-paced adventure. The first hour of the film is laden with so much silly humor that I sat there asking myself 'why, just why?' so many times. Too much time is wasted on Sam trying to get a job. There's no place for crap like that in a movie of this stature. This, together with the silliness, added to the unnecessary long running time and ruined the excitement during the first hour.Once the film reached the hour-mark, it literally is a non-stop full throttle fast-packed action-paced thrill ride. The visuals and effects are out of this world! It just proves again how well the film industry evolved. I know its all CGI but it looks incredible on film! Blending CGI with real life actors is still a challenge, but Michael Bay seems to have perfected that with his Transformer series. He has such a vast imagination!John Malkovich is a brilliant actor but he honestly was dispensable in this film and there really wasn't room for his wittiness and cocky attitude. The visuals certainly steals the show. I will remember this film for the toppling building scene. Wow, that was awesome!! If you're in the mood for action and explosions and destruction in abundance, then this is probably the perfect choice.",7,2,2,13 May 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Loads of action - and SEAN CONNERY!
","'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is the third film in the Indiana Jones series. I enjoyed 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. I hated 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'. 'The Last Crusade' is a mix between the two: there were moments I really enjoyed, and then there were moments when I just rolled my eyes.This installment is more like a James Bond film than its predecessors, until the final act when it reverts back to the Indiana Jones adventure genre. How does everything so conveniently fall into place for the characters? Indeed, just like a Bond film...Credibility has always been an issue with the Indiana Jones films. I believe they disregard reality entirely and substitute it with events that are for effect only, and sensationalism. I mean, nothing here is believable - and its not even (entirely) a fantasy film. The humor is downright silly and the film therefore can't really be taken seriously. Some scenes are pure slapstick or so unfunny that only Americans will find them funny. Despite being a movie making genius, Steven Spielberg sure can be childish sometimes...The film offers loads of action and adventure, with some incredible action sequences. Unfortunately the ever-present humor ruined the suspense of some of these scenes. For me, the film only redeemed itself during the final act - with stunning locations, interesting sets, booby traps, horror, and relentless killings. In the end, 'The Last Crusade' turns out to be quite an exciting adventure. Sean Connery was the highlight of the film (for me). The man is brilliant and a legend!",5,0,0,13 April 2020
13 Hours," Overlong with repetitive dialogue, but ultimately a good watch.
","Michael Bay is back with more mind-numbing editing! Why does he do that? But ok, apart from that, the film has some awesome aerial photography and great cinematography. The actors are also very good - and so many bearded hunks in one film is enticing to say the least!After a very confusing start, the film gets direction, and once the first attack starts, the action never slows down. Despite all this fantastic fast-paced action, though, the film itself does seem to drag, and I just didn't find it compelling enough. Maybe because the film was overlong. They should have cut it with about 20-30 minutes. At times it felt more like a video game, distancing me from the reality of the action. And why do they insist on constantly showing the time? What did it matter? Its not as if there were a deadline, and what did it matter whether it was 12:19 or 12:20? The repetitive dialogue was also an issue for me. The film also had way too many comedy elements that didn't belong.The film has some incredible visuals, especially towards the end. I did enjoy the fact the music was so subtle, never becoming overbearing or loud.",6,0,4,29 August 2018
Jurassic Park," Impossible not to be entertained.
","The impossible is made very believable through a clever script, convincing acting, superb directing and astonishingly good visual effects. It is funny and suspenseful, action-packed and exciting! 'Jurassic Park' is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorite action-adventure films of all time. The ground-breaking visual effects back in 1993 were more effective and superior even to the 2015's 'Jurassic World'.",10,1,1,1 July 2018
Alien: Covenant," Great start, but it wears out very quickly.
","I loved the introduction of characters: it was as if we already knew them instead of getting to know them. Unfortunately, though, none of these characters are compelling. The most interesting character is Walter/David, but they in effect cause more confusion and questions than anything else.Fast-paced, interesting and exciting for the first hour and a bit, then it plummets to near boredom, and then ends with a climax that screams for a sequel. I did not like the aliens in this movie, though, as they're made out to be cute instead of evil. Another seemingly unnecessary sequel/prequel. (Prometheus sequel and prequel to Alien). The film is also full of plot holes and flaws. Most importantly: these trained astronauts do not even wear protective gear when exploring a foreign planet!!",4,2,4,3 July 2018
The Island," Wow, so many plot flaws...
","Spoiler alert: in order to give an accurate review of this movie, there will be spoilers. The film starts off with a great idea. It is mysterious and keeps the viewer glued to the screen, wanting to know more. People living in a futuristic environment seem content and completely at peace with each other and their environment. They're all keen on winning the 'lotto' to go to a picturesque island. They are happy to be safe, considering the world has been destroyed and the outside world is a no-go zone. Or so they thought.It is then revealed the lotto winners are actually harvested for their organs, and the island was simply an excuse for explaining why they never return. Fair enough. Still very interesting so far. Then comes another twist: these people are clones. They are the brainchild of a brilliant doctor who came up with the idea of making clones, so humans can have organs - identical to their own - at their disposal. Like an insurance policy. Still, a very good premise.Then, however, these clones want a life of their own, and escape. Now, these clones are considered the protagonists, and the brilliant doctors and scientists suddenly become antagonists, as does the humans who invest in their own clones. Ok, now it becomes preposterous. All of a sudden the clones are the heroes and we're supposed to root for them. Why?? They are what they're intended to be, and they're not humans in the true sense of the word!!The action sequences are incredible, and the film is fast-paced. But that's about as much as I enjoyed here. So, in the end, it's supposed to be a happy ending when the clones break free from their 'captive' environment. Ok, so now what? What are they supposed to do? What is to become of them? And this is the happy ending?? Oh, boy...Would I watch it again? No.",4,0,0,15 May 2020
