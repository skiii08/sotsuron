Alien 3," Very disappointed
","I will never forgive David Fincher for killing off Newt and Hicks. After everything that Ripley went through she deserved some peace and happiness, instead she winds up bald and in a prison hell hole. The dark and gloomy atmosphere of the film, which some people have praised, left me depressed and longing for the first two entries in the series.",Null,4,6,8 July 1999
