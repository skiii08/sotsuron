Requiem for a Dream," from dream to nightmare
","While I have great respect for Darren Aronofsky I know this film would not exist without the original story by Hubert Selby Jnr. They are both to be commended for their genius.This is an extraordinary film, perfect in every way (apart from a couple of minor glitches I noticed, not worth mentioning).I particularly like the way Aronofsky has cameo appearances by Selby (prison guard in kitchen), his father Abraham (man on train in hat), and James Chinlund (long-haired man on train). Similarly he had Clint Mansell in 'Pi' as a student photographer.I also like the reuse of particular actors between the two films - Sean Gullette, Samia Shoaib and Ben Shenkman especially.There are so many aspects to this story - a snapshot of ordinary lives, interactions between mother and son, a relationship turning sour, a friendship stretched to breaking point, the quality of life ultimately destroyed.In my opinion, only Tyrone really 'survives', even though his final scene shows him on a prison cot, suffering withdrawal symptoms. It seemed to me he never became as deeply addicted as Marion or Harry, and was able to exercise some control over his habit. So even though he's in prison, he's still alive and relatively sane, compared to the main other characters.Sara has a nirvana of sorts at the end - although her brain is fried. In this state she can live completely within her head. Being in hospital means she's cared for in the basic ways - food, shelter, hygiene - and can concentrate on herself.There is hope for Harry - also in hospital, and with his infected arm removed, he may yet have some kind of life. For Marion, though, I fear, there is only further decline.",10,0,1,10 November 2005
Shaun of the Dead," zombies ahoy
","As a rule I like the zombie genre, regardless of how classy or trashy the finished product is (according to popular opinion). I found this one a bit ho-hum, unfortunately. Yes, a different angle to the usual, but it must it always rain in zombie movies? The ending, at least, was non-standard, and actually funny.I liked Barbara. I found the other characters annoying. I suppose they were meant to be annoying (to various degrees), but I found myself wishing they'd all succumb to zombie-ness and get it over with.I liked the fart joke. I liked the quick sequences outlining what they intended to do (kill Philip, rescue Barbara etc). I liked a couple of other bits, but most of it was painful for me. Now on my list of 'films to avoid'.",6,2,6,6 November 2005
Independence Day," good fun
","I like disaster movies which involve cities whose landmarks I can recognise, and especially ones involving stuff falling from the sky. I also like stories involving aliens (regardless of credibility). Therefore, despite various silly bits, I do enjoy Independence Day.My main criticism: Patricia (President's daughter) does not react to the violence and horror surrounding her. I don't think we even see a tear in her eye. Does she get upset when her mother doesn't reappear as planned? No. Does she get upset when her mother dies? No. Okay, this is meant to be a feel-good movie overall, but as the other characters get into their emotions, why can't she?My other criticism is the neatness/coincidence factor, where Jasmine stays at the bombed base, Steve goes to the base - ta-da, reunited! And Jasmine just happened to rescue the First Lady. Oh, I bet Mr President was pleased by that! (Does Steve get to be a NASA dude now? He deserves some kind of reward!) I know these points are trivial really - Patricia is not a major character and the Steve-and-Jasmine thing is an important part of the heart-swelling, tear-jerking atmosphere - so I should stop whining and just enjoy the film, yeah? I think the aliens are great - just scary enough, shades of 'Alien' (or rather, HR Geiger) in their design. Also a bit repulsive (the tentacles) so we can go 'ewww!' with a clean conscience.There are probably deep meanings in this film, 'a moral of the story', but I can't be bothered finding them. It's a 'good guys win' vehicle, with a bit of American patriotism thrown in (they'd have to, given where most of the action takes place). It's good fun, and for this film I don't mind the soppy happy ending.",7,0,1,13 November 2005
Saw," not what I expected
","I'm unlike most people, I think, in that I prefer not to read movie reviews until after I've seen the movie. There are exceptions, of course, but they are very rare. If I've enjoyed a movie my habit these days is to come online and look it up here, add it to MyMovies and almost always rate it (but not often comment). I will sometimes do this for movies I didn't like much, too, if there was any reason at all why I bothered to watch it after the point at which I decided it was junk (eg a favourite actor, or one really good character in a sea of dross).And so it is that I have got this far without being acquainted with the premise/plot/characters of 'Saw'. I do like horror, preferably 'intelligent' horror, although pulp slasher/vampire/zombie flicks are fine too (as long as they have *something* to recommend them; see above). I feel obliged to class 'Saw' as horror even though I think it's a psychological thriller first and a horror vehicle second. There *were* moments where I was backed up into the corner of the sofa with my hand over my mouth, but it was a reaction to the degrees of realism rather than being grossed out by gore FX. I was actually expecting more gore. I like zombie movies so I feel pretty acclimatised to gore (realistic or not), but I had unexpected empathetic reactions to the emotions rather than a 'repulse' reaction to gore.Only a few movies in the fright genre have ever really bothered me, but the only one I've actually had to switch off unfinished was 'Wolf Creek' - because it was *so damn good*, also because I was heavily freaked out by John Jarratt as a sociopath, having previously only seen him in neutral or positive contexts (particularly 'Playschool' and 'Better Homes and Gardens'). I was slightly worried that I would find 'Saw' unwatchable in the same way, therefore I was greatly relieved to be favourably reminded of 'Cube' (which I like very much).I was a little irked by the various continuity errors, and I felt some aspects of the plot didn't get enough explanation (or enough visual clues), but I was very pleased with Michael Emerson as Zep Hindle, knowing I recognised the face but taking a while to come up with 'Lost' (which I had to stop watching after the 2nd season because I was becoming unhealthily obsessed with it). I pegged Zep as the most likely suspect right from his first scene; it was gratifying to be wrong, and to have been so masterfully tricked. Emerson has a lingering resemblance to Brad Dourif (a great favourite), and this is a good thing, imo, if he doesn't mind doing a lot of these kinds of roles - the fringe loony, basically, or the corrupt official.Normally I am annoyed when a movie ends in such a way that there is obvious scope for a sequel, but this time it seemed the *only* way to end it - given that Zep is not, after all, the monster behind the tortures. I am looking forward to seeing 2 and 3 in the next week before heading off to the cinema (which I rarely bother to do) for the fourth installment.",8,0,1,4 November 2007
