Airlift," A Rare Subject to find a movie from Bollywood
",It is rare to find a movie on such subjects from Bollywood. I rate it 10 on 10 just on that basis. To top it the plot has been developed well with a lot of characters thrown in to keep the plot interesting. The George and Ibrahim character for example. George is particularly interesting as he displays the typical Indian stereotype who are so fond of picking on others mistakes but will rarely do something on their own. It also shows how there are some very good people in the Indian bureaucracy because of which things still move. I would love to see another movie on the Yemen evacuation. I would recommend this just on the basis on the subject on which this movie has been made.,9,1,2,28 May 2016
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Confused Screenplay and a Drag for 3 Hrs
","The screenplay was completely confused and a lot of sequences where added just keep in a certain audience in mind and completely diluted the gravity and seriousness that the movie such as this should have tried to aim for.When you try to cater to all the segments of an audience you end up with a very average to a below average piece of ****. That is what BMB is. Even I find it surprising that how MS approved of this movie.Maybe FA did a good job but one actor doing a good job does not make a good movie and that counts for only 5-10% of the overall product.The sequencing of the movie was completely mixed up and resulted in confusion. The movie drags for 3 hrs and they do not have any good content to show. The characters have not been developed properly and unnecessary sex scenes have been put. Had they put in one more scene I would have not hesitated it calling it a soft core porn movie.Cannot help but compare it with Paan Sign Tomar which has a very similar story. It was a much much better than MBM on all counts and although FA may have worked very hard IK did much better job as Paan Singh. While I will not blame FA for it, the character of MS was not at all developed in the movie as the director had set out to create a typical spicy Bollywood sex flick rather than anything worthwhile.",1,11,25,22 July 2013
