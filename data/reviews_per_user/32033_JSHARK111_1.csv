Alien 3," The most underated 3rd installment of all time
","I am sick and tired of hearing all these complaints that this movie was absolutely horrible. I saw this movie for the first time last weekend and I had already heard all the negative comments on the movie about it losing two of the characters from Aliens and it has a bad ending. Well I saw it and I was completely blown away! David Ficher's directing was brilliant, Elliot Goldenthal's score was magnificent, the acting was great and had probably some of the best scenes in the whole series. I understand that the fans might have been annoyed by the abscence of the two characters from the 2nd installment, but please, that's what distracted them from enjoying this movie. This movie doesn't deserve a 6.0, it deserves at least a seven. The ending on the contrary was the perfect way to end the series. I just want to forget that Alien Ressurection ever existed.",Null,2,4,11 September 2003
