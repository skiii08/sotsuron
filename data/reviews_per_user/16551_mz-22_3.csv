The Incredible Hulk," Good fun, but not a good film.
","I'm a big fan of marvel films. They just can't do wrong in my mind. Having first seen this now some 10 years after its release, it feels old. When I rewatch iron man or avengers, they don't feel old. The script and dialogue are weak. Plot lines either don't tie in or are just (even by comic book standards) utterly ridiculous. A fun watch, but don't expect a cerebral awakening on this one.",7,0,0,27 April 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Expect crap, experience the full reward.
","An amazingly intense psychological thriller at every turn. Just when you think you've got it figured out, nope. Twists and turns lead to an unexpected conclusion. It takes a lot to hold my attention. This movie did that for every minute.",7,0,0,4 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Beyond infinity!!
",This is so well done. The pop culture references (see aressted development).. the melding of all of the characters and movies into this mega blockbuster. Just wow. I don't review so strongly often.,9,1,5,10 August 2018
