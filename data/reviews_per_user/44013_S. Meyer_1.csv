The Blair Witch Project," As time passes, it's growing on me.
","I saw Blair Witch Project this past weekend with much anticipation. Unfortunately, I assumed that I would be really scared, that I would experience that type of fear that makes one jump from his or her chair. As we exited the theater, I found myself asking, 'That was it?'  I must say, though, that thoughts of the film's more intense scenes and its final image raced through my head as I drove home.  I've found myself thinking about it quite a bit -- so much so that I now have to ask myself:  If the movie sucked so bad and let me down, why am I still thinking about it?To those who couldn't/can't stand the constant movement of the camera:  I think that this tale could not have been told in a more effective manner. The fact that the audience is seeing everything through the lenses of two types of cameras that most of us have at some time used or are at least familiar with gives the story an unspoken credibility, one that screams 'This was not filmed on a Hollywood lot; this happened to real people just like you!'I've now officially changed my opinion from 'It was really disappointing' to 'Give it a chance.  It will stay with you.' And if it continues to haunt you, hasn't the film done it's job?",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
