The Rock," Action Comedy
","First things first, this is not a thriller flick. Although there are some thrilling moments here and there, most of the movie is a mix of generic action, punch-lines and comedy. Characters tend to spit out some clich√© phrases for comedic relief.Connery and Harris steals the show. They are great. Cage is great too, but he's mostly the Cage we know.Overall, OK movie to watch, but no great action masterpiece as it tries to be. It's more of an adult action comedy flick than a thriller. Kinda like an adventure with Brendan Fraser.",7,1,2,6 March 2019
Ford v Ferrari," Bale and Damon steals the show
","Good ride! That's the best summary. Ford v Ferrari is a good drama about the Ford company wanting to out-top Ferrari in the race tracks. It tells the story of Chelby and Miles and their crusade to win the Le Mans 24 hours race.Damon and Bale are top-notch here. Great acting, great scenes. Might make you even cry.Soundtrack is good and keeps the tone of the movie.Movie kinda drags for a while sometimes... it could be a little shorter. Sometimes it's just some drama filler to build up for what we are waiting for: the Le Mans race.Nothing to say on the events credibility because I'm not familiar with the real facts, and that doesn't bother me as well. It's supposed to be someone's take on the story, and that's ok by me!Overall, I'd recommend it if you like racing and drama combined.",8,4,11,17 November 2019
Child 44," Awesome drama thriller.
","This movie is great. An excelent drama thriller with some investigation elements. It makes you care about the main characters and despise the whole time period and location they live in. You're always rooting for them and thrilled until the very end.Minor complaints are pretty much pet peeves of mine. For example, I'm not sure about the criminal's intentions. I think it was left way to open or I didn't even get it at all.Great movie.",9,1,3,7 January 2018
It," IT is good
","When you go to watch a movie that is an adaptation from a novel, you basically fall into one of two categories: you're either one who read the novel and wants to see how the novel's adaptation into the cinema will play out, or you're one who didn't read the novel and just want to watch a good movie. I'm the latter.So, basically what plays out is that there's this one evil entity that wakes up once every 27-ish years and, when it does, it goes out hunting its favorite prey: kids. It feeds not only on human flesh, but also on their fears. There are a bunch of kids going missing on the city of Derry, Maine, and people seem to pay little attention towards this; it kinda bothers me. Then again, people seem to be f'ed up on their minds on Derry; pretty much everyone we are introduced in the movie has some sort of psychological disorder, as minimal as it may be.One thing that I'm not so sure is how the Losers' Club realise so fast what is going on. We see It playing tricks on them all and, all of the sudden, they know what they are in for. Once again, I didn't read the novel, so I'm not sure how the story unfolds there, but in the movie, I felt that they were way too smart; soon they know pretty much everything they need to know. I don't know...Acting is great! Everyone is awesome on their expressions and emotions. It even has some comic relief that made me chuckle for a while. Great stuff.It is a good movie. I'm not sure if people who read the novel will like it, but as a movie by itself, it is good.",8,0,0,6 October 2019
Memento," Amazing movie! Or is it?
","Memento (2000) tells the story of Leonard and his quest to find the guy who raped and killed his wife. Only one problem: Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, which means his mind can't record anything new, pretty much.The movie sort of tells itselft backwards. You start from the ending, without much information, and the plot builds itself as the movie continues. It's interesting and well-done. Though this is a slow-paced movie, your curiosity will lead you through its entirety without leaving you bored or anything; you simply want answers and you'll get them.If you pay attention, you'll start feeling like Leonard. Things happen, then they sort of repeat, but you will start questioning if you saw it right, or if it really was like that before, or if you really saw a 1 or an I, things like that. The mark of a great movie, surely; it sucks you in!All in all, a must. Not a movie to just watch, you need to feel it.",10,1,2,13 January 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Great movie with that distinct Tarantino's touch!
","I think there is not much to say about Inglourious Basterds that hasn't been said before. Another fine entry by Tarantino.The movie follows a series of narratives devided into chapters, like a theater play or a book, but nothing is out of chronological order, as far as I could tell. Everything happens in a nice pace and it is great to watch, though it is a very long film.It's funny to see those kinky little stereotypes that are given to each 'nation', per say.The plot twist is good and unexpected, one might say that is a ballsy move, and I liked it. Overall good movie, but might stretch out for too long if you're not in the mood.",10,1,4,25 April 2018
Argo," Good movie. Nice adaptation.
","Argo (2012) is a nice adaptation of the Canadian Caper events.If you're going for it, you gotta be aware that, most of the times, a police drama thriller is not about action, fast scenes, no; it's about tension, plot, thrill.Good movie.",10,1,2,6 January 2018
Knives Out," Good movie! (I'd throw up if I was lying...)
","The patriarch of a rather unusual family commits suicide. Or did he? Knives Out is a great 'who's done it?' movie where an eccentric detective, Benoite Blanc, tries to unfold the mystery surronding this so-called suicide.The songs are good and remembers me a lot of those 90's dark comedies, like the Adams Family. Acting is also great, everyone steals the show when on focus.The plot is good and keeps the audience attached until the very end. Plot-twists are done spetacular and everything runs smoothly and enjoyable.Overall, a good dark-ish movie for Thanksgiving.",10,2,7,25 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," A long good movie, if you're up to the task.
","Plot (10 out of 10): If you like Tarantino's work, then this is for you. Since the beginning, you'll see his touch.Acting (10 out of 10): Everyone's believeable and doubtful at the same time. Thrill (5 out of 10): You might get thrilled here and there, but they come in short bursts. Most of the time, you're just curious.Entertainment (8 out of 10): The movie's entertaining and even funny sometimes, but I can see some people thinking it's dragging way too much.Soundtrack (8 out of 10): The soundtrack comes with Tarantino's touch. Some might considerer it strange, but that's the way he likes it.Special Effects (10 out of 10): It's gory and it's practical effects. All in all, good thing to see.Movie's main characteristic: Plot-driven.Final Score: 8.5 (9).Summary: It's a long movie. If you like Tarantino's work, you'll like this movie and will watch it as a whole without noticing the time flying by. If you're first-timer, it might feel like it's draggin' way too much. In fact, that's one thing in this movie, everything happens full of detail, so every scene is a long one.",9,3,7,7 October 2018
Predator," Weird action thriller that spawned a legacy.
","ACTING 5/10 Though we could say it has Arnie at his best here, Predator (1987) is a festival of plank characters with strong personalities.SOUNDTRACK 5/10 Overall, generic action movie soundtrack for the time.SPECIAL EFFECTS 7/10 Even though they did a great job with what they had, you'll be seeing some weird CGI and that heat detection camera view that is overused throughout the movie.PLOT 6/10 Predator spawned a legacy of his own, but we gotta be real here: its plot is as simple as it gets. 'A rescue time is called to, duh, rescue hostages from a bunch of guerrillas.' Sounds generic, and it is! The plot twist: they are being hunted since the beginning by a killing machine creature. Nothing is explained enough and it's all about them being hunted down.OVERALL 6 (5.75)/10 Predator creates an inovative, sort of weird, plot that manages to deliver. It's nothing but good ol' 80's action.",6,0,2,25 June 2018
The Usual Suspects," Masterfully done.
","As 'Agent10' wrote on his/her review: 'Not enough good things to say'. Overall, a must for every lover of thriller, crime, mistery genres.Acting is great and can't be described with words. You believe everyone; you suspect everyone.Masterpiece!",10,0,1,1 August 2018
Inside Out," Strong drama about how reality affects us overall
","Inside Out is a straightforward movie that fantasises over how your mind works overall, specially on personality development and memory creation.I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to a kid. It's not a movie where you'll be laughing your way throughout it; actually, most of it is like a strong drama. Some themes are not even for children.One will be following the adventure of Joy and Sadness as they try to get back to 'Head'quarters, where all mind-related happens. As they proceed, they learn how life works overall and how one should accept reality as it is.It has nice animation and a catchy vibe to it. If you're a fan of this kind of movies, this one is a go for sure.",8,1,2,9 June 2019
No Country for Old Men," A movie about randomness and strong personas
","If you're up for a movie that's driven by casuality, pessimism and strong characters, this is for you. Don't expect good things happening.Every character builds itself strongly throughout the movie and stands as a main character each time they appear. They all have their own motives and wills. Not a movie for everyone, for sure.",7,0,0,4 September 2018
Gone Girl," Wow... I'm just... wow...!
","Well, to sum things up, here you go: this movie is great! It's a 'must watch' to everyone who loves a crime/drama/police thriller.Nothing is perfect, of course, though the flaws I've noticed are minimal, next to nonexistent! I think they are more related to a pet peeve of mine of thinking that things in real life don't go on some directions movie tends to go. I believe, for example, the police isn't so naive, but I may be wrong...I can't finish without mentioning the ending. Relax, no spoilers. Just saying it's... mind blowing, to say the least. However, I have to mention that there could be multiple endings to this movie, so I'm not sure which one would fit the best. The ending chosen was fine, was awesome, but some people may go 'I don't know' on this one.The final score can't be other than 10. The movie is perfect on doing what it should do: entertain!",10,0,4,8 December 2015
Evil Dead," A remake that isn't a remake.
","It's funny: this movie is a remake from the original Evil Dead from 1981, but it also isn't a remake.The original Evil Dead trilogy are classics. We can't touch that. Classics are 'unreviewable'. When a movie falls into that cult territory, you can't review it anymore: it's a classic. Same situation would be to review Mr. Romero's 'of the Dead' series. They are all classics, with their faults, but they are classics. At least, they are watchable at its finest.I first was introduced to this movie as it being a remake from the original Evil Dead (1981 - 'ED-81', for short); and I watched it expecting that. Oh, boy...When it ended, I was like: 'what the... did I just watch!?'. It's a mess! Iconical character Ash was absent, though David is the modern impersonation of Ash; the plot is similar to the original ED-81 with some modifications; remarkable scenes from ED-81 was absent as well. Basically, I'd go on saying that they remade the ED-81 focusing only on the gore and graphical part and, at the end, they put some dark humor onto it and thought it was OK. I was in shock!Then I did some digging. I found out that this is, indeed, a 'remake' of the ED-81, but it's also a new entry to the Evil Dead series! It's as if they used the same plot with some slight modifications from the ED-81, but the events happens canonical to the Evil Dead series, meaning that, though the things happening to the characters from this movie are pretty much the same that happened to the ones in ED-81, this is a whole new event that's happening, adding to the series storyline. Whoah..!Funny, right? Why not make a whole new movie instead!? Money is the answer. They knew people who are familiar to the series would go crazy to watch this.Overall, I think the movie was OK. It's kinda confusing to figure what they were thinking: they entered a serious road, focusing on the horror aspect, but then, at the end, they went down the dark comedy section, similar to the ED-81 take -- but you can't forget this isn't just a remake, it's like this is Evil Dead 3 (Army of Darkness is a different approach). Messy... messy...Newcomers will get entertained, I think. It's the same old horror stuff. Veterans might get kinda mad, I don't know. I think they could've done a whole brand new entry to the series, not a 'remake' of the ED-81 but also adding to the series storyline. That's convoluted.Watch it at your own risk.",7,1,5,20 December 2015
The Evil Dead," So bad, it's great.
","The Evil Dead (1981) is a cult classic.All elements of a terrible B-horror movie is here: bad acting, terrible plot, a character that stands out from the rest of the crew and a lot of gore. It's funny to see Ash's persona building out until the final√©. It sets the tone for the next installment.Overal, watch it only if you're a fan of B-horror movies. Or if you're drunk.",7,0,1,10 June 2018
Jurassic World," Not great by any means, but it is an OK movie.
","This movie definitely tries to live on its predecessors glory -- and kinda fails, kinda...It has some pretty awesome special effects, I'll give it that. Though some ideas are just plain 'seriously?'.I can't say it's bad, because it isn't. Is it good? Yes. Is it great? No, not at all. It's watchable, that's it.There are some moments that will make you go skeptical; some facts are hard to accept.The ending wasn't that nice. It was expected, but it's a mess! Actually, everything in this movie is expected; it's all about clich√©s!It is a movie to watch only for the fun. It ain't no Jurassic Park 4.",5,1,5,24 October 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," A fine movie to watch.
","'The Adjustment Bureau' is an awesome drama/sci-fi flick to watch on a boring day.This movie has that thriller feeling imbued into it as the storyline progresses, and is captivating. Until things are clear, you're left to question what's going on and what's everything.I didn't see major flaws in this movie. Overall, it delivers itself fine.The acting was fine as well.The bureau concept, however, has some minor... misconceptions that those quite aware of 'historical' facts or transcripts might not overlook; but that's just pet peeve of mine.Overall, this movie is fine and deserves some attention.",7,0,0,5 August 2015
From Hell," Good take on Jack, the Ripper, events. Warning: it's a movie!
","People need to get things straight from the beginning: From Hell (2001) is not a documentary by any means. It takes a well known series of unfortunate events and gives its own take on it. Of course, to spice things up, it adds some known theories into the mix to add thrill and drama.It has a slow pace, as for many great police thrillers. It's a movie about watching a series of events and a finale; there're little to no action scenes or whatnot. I have to say I kinda dislike Abberline's take on this movie. It has way too many Johnny Depp thrown into it and maybe over the top re-imagination into his persona.Overall, good movie if you're into some slow paced police investigation thriller.",9,0,1,20 March 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's touch was born here!
","Reservoir Dogs (1992) is a slow paced story-driven flick about a heist gone wrong.It's a Tarantino's movie, so go on for it knowing that: plot is not linear, there's a lot of swearing, acting is great, story is awesome. Enough said!",10,4,5,10 June 2018
Sicario," Is acting out of bounds a good thing?
","Plot (8 out of 10): Although some aspects of it are expected and some characters are not deeply explored, the plot grabs your attention throughout most of the movie.Thrill (7 out of 10): It might be considered way too slow paced for some audience.Entertainment (9 out of 10): If you're up for some heavy crime drama, this movie's up for the task.Soudntrack (7 out of 10): Soundtrack is enough to make the scene, but nothing really stands out.Special Effects (8 out of 10): Some weird 'body heat' effects towards the end. Most of the movie is fine.Final Score: 7.8 (8).Summary: Sicario is a crime drama thriller about 'making the law' through dirty acts. It makes you question if that's the way to solve things. I found it straightforward, but something on it took my attention. Acting is great and feels real. Recommended.",8,0,0,7 October 2018
Mystic River," Dark and powerful movie with some strange elements to it
","We have three kids that were once friends and one of them had a terrible event happening in his life. They grew up and followed different paths, but remained acquaintances. This sets the tone for the movie as one of the characters' daughter is brutally murdered.It's a great movie about investigating this murderer, though it doesn't overcomplicate itself way too much; it feels kinda real. They pretty much get in the right lead kinda fast, actuallly.In the midst of everything, a creepy call from a woman towards one of the characters bugs me to the point where it gets annoying and weird. So weird that, at one point, I was calling her 'names'.A dark ending paints what this movie is all about. A dark and rather emotionless ending.",7,0,0,4 September 2018
Joker," Great standalone movie
","First of all, I'm not good with Comics and anything Marvel/DC related. I don't know any stories, or any facts whatsoever. I went to watch Joker as a standalone movie, like any other movie; and it was great.It is a slow paced movie. Methodical; you pretty much get to sympathize with Arthur Fleck; you get his pain and his delusions. Joaquin's performance is top notch!I liked this portrait of the Joker. A delusional maniac, hysterical, insane. When you see the Joker's' development into a satyrical killer, his descent into madness, it's fantastic.Overall, good movie! Not sure if it breaks any paradigm over what's in the books/comics, but, as a standalone movie, it is good.",10,3,5,6 October 2019
It Chapter Two," IT was great
","Once again, I fall into the category of individuals who didn't read the novel (yet). So I went fully unaware of what to expect. And it was a good ride!It: Chapter Two picks up 27 years after the events of the first chapter. The It entity is awake again and up to its shenanigans, so it's up to the Losers' Club to remember their oath and hunt the fiend.It is a long movie, but I didn't feel the drag. I was entertained enough that, when I realised, it was already at the final√©! At least that's how I felt (and pretty much everyone in theaters).It was surely not a scary movie. I saw many people complaining about this. I think it was ok; I'm not fond of jumpscares, but there were many, many scary sequences (and all of them lead to a jumpscare, so that's a 50-50 score). And, also, a lot of comic relief, and I like it. I laughed out loud at some scenes!Overall, great ride. Not a perfect 10 because of overuse of jumpscares and some weird CGI.",9,0,1,7 October 2019
Cube," I'm not sure what did I just watch...
","OK, the idea is promising, just kinda overused (by now): six people find themselves trapped inside a cube-like maze. Their goal: to make out of it alive!Who put them there? Why? Why them? That's what keeps us going; that's what kept me going. And boy, oh, boy, was I a fool...Character acting is mediocre, to say the best (except for Andrew Miller). No real sense is put into those dialogs and scenes. They seem like a bunch of commercial ad actors put inside a deadly maze. Also, I think pretty much no sense is made out of all that happens. No explanaition at all. It' way too scripted and superficial to be true.The Cube seemed like a cool idea, but I think the plot flopped somehow, specially the final√©.A 3/10 because it kept me watching until the end, even though it dissapointed me; also, because it was promising, like I've stated before.",3,2,3,12 October 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," If you've watched the first one, you pretty much watched this one too.
","John Wick: Chapter 2 is what it is: a sequel to John Wick with nothing new. It's over the top action that might get a little dull on your mind.As in the first installment, John Wick is an unstoppable killing machine that loves his dog and his car a lot and will do anything to protect them. Only problem, though, everyone wants his head. There's not too much to the plot, like the first one.It tries to give him some sort of emotion, but Keanu's plank acting gives John's persona a touch of love and credibility: he's really the Boogeyman.If you like nonsensical action, this is the movie for you. If you liked the first one, you won't get dissapointed.",8,1,3,3 June 2018
