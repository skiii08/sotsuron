Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why a children's movie?
","This movie is a children's movie. The desire to make it appeal to the largest audience possible, makes this movie average -- at best -- with the F/X being the only thing that is truly impressive. Some nice performances, though, such as Pernilla August and Ewan McGregor.",5,0,1,27 May 1999
The Commitments," A beautiful movie!
","When I saw it back in 1993, this movie touched me. Deeply! Since then I have seen it about 15 times. It is the tale of a young working-class Dubliner who starts a band. Simple enough, but that's only the beginning. Then the characters, and the well-laid story comes into play. The acting is top-notch all the way. The characters are simultaneously funny and sad. The music is incredible, and the story is beautiful.All in all, a beautiful movie.",9,1,2,10 April 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick!
","What better one line summary can one come up with than 'Kubrick'? Even beyond the grave he challenges people and creates dissension. This is not new when it comes to Kubrick. This latest piece of work is nothing less than a masterpiece. Yet again the focus is, somehow, not on the acting as such, but rather the plot. The plot is the real main character in this movie. As for the actors... Well I guess that most actors could have pulled off what Cruise and Kidman achieved. These are not the best actors in Hollywood. They are not bad, but there are better. But as I said: In this movie, it does not matter.I can not remember the last time I heard music that was as haunting as the score for this movie. It gave the movie an ethereal, supernatural quality that almost made you wish that something supernatural would happen in the movie -- not so much consciously as subconsciously. The eerie piano playing its strange melody, accompanying Cruise in that weird mask, just standing there, saying nothing. It kept me at the edge of my seat.As for the plot: It is a stroke of genius. Such a simple story as that of a couple who are in a rut. Nothing particularly exciting happens in their life. That is to say, before the movie truly begins. Then it becomes a fascinating look into emotional life, sexuality and psyche. The audience feels compelled both to loathe Cruise and to love him. All the while he explores his world, the world changes. My hat off and a deep bow to one of the greatest directors that ever liv√©d in the tide of times. You will be forever in our hearts, Stanley Kubrick.",9,0,0,13 September 1999
Titanic," Good... But not great.
","This is a good movie -- there's no doubt about that. However, it is not all it's cracked up to be. I saw it about a week after it opened in Sweden.
There are some magnificent performances, for instance the oft forgotten Billy Zane, playing the jealous would-be husband of Rose, 'Cal' Hockley. I must confess that I have something against Leonardo DiCaprio, but there are a few performances in which he shines! These are: 'Luke' in the series Growing Pains, 'Arnie' in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and 'Jack' in Titanic. Kate Winslet, however, delivers a very stereotypical 'rich-girl-getting-a-taste-of-the-wild-life' performance, which I soon put out of my mind. The best female performances are instead Kathy Bates as ''Unsinkable' Molly Brown and Frances Fisher as 'Ruth DeWitt Butaker'.
A final note: The saddest moment of the movie is not the one people usually thinks about, but rather the fate of 'Tommy Ryan' (Jason Barry)... watch it again, and see what I mean. I don't usually cry at movies, but during that scene, I was close to tears.",8,0,2,10 May 2000
The Sixth Sense," I doesn't get much better than this.
","This movie was incredible. I don't think I have ever seen Bruce Willis better and young Haley Joel Osment has an incredible future ahead, if he keeps this up. He already had Forrest Gump on his record, in which he was very good as the young Forrest.On to the movie itself: It scared the living hell out of me! I have lately been complaining that there has not been enough really good mystery/supernatural/horror movies lately. This one came along at just the right time. The suspense that is built up is phenomenal. It's all the little things that do it. Just little details -- that are hard to define. And the interplay between the characters is great. I actually lost track of time, and the fact that I was 'just' watching a movie... I am going to see this one at least twice more.",10,0,0,1 September 1999
The Truman Show," Thank you, Mr Weir
","All I can say is: Thank you, Mr Weir.Thank you for letting Jim Carrey show more of his register. Thank you for making this movie.",9,0,0,10 January 1999
