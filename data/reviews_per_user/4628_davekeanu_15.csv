Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Love this film
","Honestly I don't get it why so many people hate this movie I can understand it is a bit too long but its not the weakest in the series, the weakest one in the series would have to be episode 2 Attack of the Clones, having too much romance in it. But I think this one is a lot more better then episode 2 in many ways. And also I think Jar Jar Binks is a rather underrated character I know he can be annoying at times but he did play a large role in this film which fans are missing the point. The pod race is problay the best scene in this whole film as it was rather enjoyable to watch over and over again on youtube. Soundtrack is amazing and very well done for this movie. I know some people hate this movie just because of one character but come on give this movie another chance it will surprised you in many ways. overall Episode 1 is rather underrated and needs another chance 8/10",8,20,24,13 June 2016
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Another great 80s classic
","I love the Star wars films they are amazing they have great sound tracks and great characters too. I also found out that Harrison Ford who also plays Han Solo in the Star Wars, also plays Indiana Jones as well at first I thought this was not going to be good as star wars but I was wrong I really enjoyed this film I know its not as good as Star wars but its wroth watching for all ages Harrison Ford does amazing job playing Indiana Jones as what he did as Han solo in the Star wars The theme song is catchy and beautiful which really suits the main character Overall another great 80s classic and a masterpiece as well wroth watching 10/10",9,0,0,3 June 2016
Elf," He's angry Elf
",I am been a huge fan of Christmas movies as they have a lot of comedy in them they make laugh and cry at times. But when its comes to movies with Will Farell I am not pleased as I find his movies rather too silly at times and rather boring but Elf was great one as its funny and sad and enjoyable to watch for the whole family. I loved it when Peter Dinklage came on scream as Miles Finch he did amazing job as Miles finch which makes him my favorite character in this film. Can't wait too watch him in the game of thrones as I heard he does amazing job in it But Buddy is the one who I think that steals the show as he going searching for his long lost father and to make have a change of heart about Christmas Overall a great Christmas movie wroth watching 8/10,8,0,1,11 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Rather weak but still watchable
","As I an older Star wars fan I do still like the prequels, Revenge of the sith is by far the best in the prequels The phantom of menace is very good but its is bit too long as for Attack of the clones well it is rather weak compared to the other star wars films. Fans do say this is their least favorite in the star wars series and saying its the worst one out all of them. While I do agear that it is weak rather forgettable,but I disappear that its the worst movie ever made. its not that bad at all but I think it could of been a tiny bit more stronger here list of things that made this film weak. 1. too much romance okay in the empire strikes back their was bit of romance but not to the point of romance in this one. 2. not enough Jango fett or Count Douko as I think that we don't much about these expect that douko did appear a lot in the clone wars series but I would like to know a little bit more of Jango Fett as he had less scream time in this whole film. all in all still a watchable but probley the weakest one in the series so far. but I still like this film I just think it could of been a bit more stronger 7/10 for still watchable but weak",7,0,1,11 June 2016
Back to the Future Part III," Wild west fun
",out of all of the three back to the future movies this one has to be my favourite out of three I remember watching this movie as a kid and enjoying it from the beginning to the end the wild west themes are beautiful in this movie and are very well done I laughed my head off when Marty screamed out Indians when he traveled back in time to the wild west to find Doc Brown Train scene is my favourite out of this whole movie and very well done for exploding scene as well overall a fantastic movie 10/10,10,1,1,26 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not as bad as what people say it is
","Yes if you compare this to the force awakens and the original trilogy this is not an outstanding movie. But I thought it was really enjoyable yes it does have it flaws which I will listed here below.1. who are Ray's parents this is something that we need to know about Ray who are here parents and where did she come from which is something we really need to know about since the force awakens. 2. Leader Smoke being killed off in this movie was a bit of a mistake I think they should of kept him alive for eps 9 because I would love to see what he is really like. But overall this was a great movie despite of its flaws I know it is the weakest of the sequel trilogy but it is still enjoyable, but all three of the trilogys have a weak part like the prequel trilogy its Attack of the clones and the original trilogy its return of the jedi. But it is still great with a flaws here and their that could of easily been fixed but lets just see if we will get a backstory for Ray for eps 9. 7/10",7,2,16,2 October 2018
The Hangover Part II," Funny and a watchable
",While I have not seen the first movie of Hang over I still Think this is a great movie to watch its funny and enjoyable and has great taste something that Seth Macfarlane really needs to work on his Adult swim junk. Places for this movie are amazing being set in Thailand at I thought they where set in China somewhere but I found they where set Thailand which is a place I always wanted to see on places to go bucket list. Overall a very funny movie if you don't take it too seriously I would give it a 10/10 but I Thought to give a 9 instead Great movie wroth a watch,9,0,0,3 June 2016
A Bug's Life," The time of your life
",Pixar has had a lot of great movies and I loved all of them they have great stories and wonderful funny characters. I have been a huge fan of Toy Story I loved the plot of the film of being about two toys being separated from their owner and ending up at an evil nasty toy abuser who turns toys into horribly nasty looking things. After Toy Story was a huge hit at the box office pixar deiced to make of film about bugs which the idea came around in 1995 around the same time when toy story came out. But Dream works copy their idea and making a film about ants which is also a bug's life is also about. And people are saying that these two films are the same movie but their not while Antz is dark and the CGI is very lack. But A bug's life is also dark but Funny and enjoyable. Hooper is a great villain he has to be best pixar villain and one of the best Disney villains of all times. But Flik is the one who steals the show as He is kind funny and very smart which I can related to him a lot. While Antz is a good movie I not a fan of it but A bug's life is a I can watch over and over again the song from Randy Newman the time of your life is very catchy as gets stuck in my head telling me to enjoy my life while I can and to now to worry about the past or the further 8/10,8,0,0,11 June 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Great movie to be based on the book
",I remember me and my sister watching this movie on video after it came out and what to say I really like it. Its funny and a watchable to watch even throe it does have some scary scenes in it like the three headed dog and the two face guy when he takes his turban off. The characters are very likable in this film as they are in the book. The castle is beautiful being filmed in Scotland. I would give this movie 10 stars deposited one flow and that being too long Great film wroth a watch and it deafeningly followed the book very well I will review the second one soon so get an eye out9/10,9,1,2,6 June 2016
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," More a watchable then the first one
",I really enjoyed the first Harry Potter but even theore it was a bit scary and a bit too long but I found this one a lot more better then the first one. It was Dark at times but still enjoyable to watch I loved the flying car I think it's great car such shame it did not appear in the last film which would of been. The spiders are scary but I can under stand they are just CGI puppets. Ron was pretty funny at times which I like about his character I think they put more effort into his character then they did in the first one. Great movie much better then the first one worth watching if you are in the mood 10/10,10,1,2,11 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Amazing
","When it comes to SCFI movies I not really pleased but Star wars is by far the best I have been I huge fan of the series ever since I first watch episode 1 that was released back in 1999 with that annoying character jar jar binks which every one hates but I like. This movie is by far a great follow up too the last six films. This movie has great moments in it which I love. BB8 is wonderful as a new character and member to the star wars gang, he has mix of R2D2 and C3po in him which is what I love about his character. overall this is movie you should watch if you are in the mood This movie brings back the magic in the last six Star Wars films excuse me I am off to watch more SCFI films with killing Daleks and a blue box that is bigger in the inside ' wroth watching",10,4,27,30 May 2016
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Where it all began
",I remember when I was 9 years old when this movie was repeated on channel 10 and I found it really enjoyable to watch. The story is very strong for a SCIF movie. The costumes are very good for the aliens and the robots too. The most likable characters are Luke sykerwalker Han Solo and C3po and R2D2 But I think its the droids are the ones who steal the comedy in this movie As always the story always go for a part 2 so their is always a little more more to the story and secrets being revealed latter on in the series. Overall This is another classic masterpiece that is wroth watching. 10/10,10,1,1,6 June 2016
Deadpool," yes its stupid but its enjoyable
",If you compare this to other DC and Marvel films Deadpool is not an outstanding film yes it does have some scenes that are Offinece and rude and Racist but its not that bad of for an anti hero film here are some of the things that I did and did not like about this film. 1. some scenes are rather inaporepet at times which could of been cut out of the film and be an bonus feather on the DVD and Blu ray release. 2. I think the film is a bit overrated giving it an 8.2 on IMDb I think at least give it an 7.3 instead just because some of the sexual scenes are a bit too much. I do like this movie as it is one of my favorite SCIF but The sex scenes where a bit too much overall its a great film if you don't take it too seriously 7/10,7,2,7,11 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Luke I am your father
",While I have not seen this movie in along time I still think it's amazing movie to great classic. people say this is their favorite film and the best in the series well I have to agear on that. The romance between Liah and Han sola was beautiful much well done then in episode 2 Attack of the clones. C3po getting blown up was very funny and seeing him get put back together was also funny as well. This movie gave us best line in movie history and has been remembered since this movie came out to theaters in 1980. Overall This movie was amazing and it's wroth watching this is a true movie masterpiece 10/10,10,1,2,13 June 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," Beautiful and amazing
",I have always been interested in going to India I heard so much about it. Having so many religions and having great places to see their like the mountains and Punjab. And This movie is by far a great movie to watch I love the story and the characters are very likable even if some scenes can be bit scary to watch I still think its a great movie to watch. Even if you let down in your luck sometimes their is always going to be a sliver lining to be their for you no mater what. Overall a great movie to watch wroth a watch I hope some day I will visit India one day.great story and great soundtracks 10/10,10,1,2,3 June 2016
