The Blair Witch Project," One of the most effective horror movies ever made
","If you're a fan of horror movies then you absolutely must see this classic if you haven't already. In 1999 when this extremely low budget movie was released, it very quickly became a success, both with critics reviews and with the box office. It raked in over 140 million dollars. It was made for about 40 thousand dollars, it was literally all filmed by these three young people, this is the found footage category of horror films all began. We have the filmmakers of the Blair watch project to thank for movies like paranormal activity. I love scary movies like this! This is how you make an effective scary movies that actually scares viewers. Too many horror movies use buckets of fake blood, over the top effects, and show you exactly what you're supposed to be afraid of. This movie does none of those things, not a one of those tactics are exercised at any point. And not doing any of those things is what makes this film work and it's what made it so popular back in 1999. The performances by heather, mike, and josh are all so great, they're realistic and very believable. With this movie, if the performances by the three actors didn't work, then nothing would've worked at all because that's all it is. Seeing these actors reactions to the supposed horrors that are happening to them is what sends a chill up your spine. You hear one of the guys yelling for help at night and you hear far off creepy sounds. These things are effective because it's dark and you literally have no clue what it is you're supposed to be scared of. The stick figures hanging in the woods was a good touch too, it just added on to the eerie creepy factor. If you're going to watch a scary movie one night and you have yet to see this one, just give it a try I promise you won't be disappointed. And the ending is just the icing on the cake. It's done extremely well. 10/10!",10,1,3,15 April 2017
Insidious: Chapter 2," Not as strong as #1, but still good
","Insidious Chapter 2 (2013) is not to the quality level of the first movie. I'll just start out by saying that, because it's true that the first is stronger, but that doesn't mean that this sequel isn't still good. This sequel picks up exactly where the first one left off. So make sure and watch the first one first. So if you've seen the first one, then you'll know that the first one ends with the death of Lin Shaye's character, death by Patrick Wilsons character. We don't know how it's possible that this could happen, everything seemed completely fine and then he strangles her to death after she takes his picture for some unknown reason. This movie is all about finding out why he did such a horrible thing and the backstory that goes into all that. The reasoning and backstory is all very interesting and that's what will keep the audiences attention throughout. I loved the acting in this movie, all the previous actors reprise their roles here and they all do well, just as they did previously. The writing isn't quite as solid as the first movie, but the places where the writing in this one gets good is when everything is being explained. Why Patrick Wilsons character, josh, seems almost possessed and how exactly all that happened. There are several scenes that are genuinely scary and will very likely frighten just about anyone, so horror fans will not be disappointed. Overall, this is an entertaining scary installment in the insidious movie franchise. 7/10 for Insidious Chapter 2.",7,0,0,29 November 2017
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Better than the first film
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets is a better movie then the original national treasure movie. The cast stays the same except trade in Sean Bean for Ed Harris and add on Helen Mirren. The acting is good here, I enjoyed cage and Kruger, very good chemistry, even better here than in the first. And I loved seeing Helen Mirren in this film, she is a fine actress and I loved her performance as Ben's mom and Patrick's ex-wife. The dynamic between Mirren and Voight is interesting and they work very well together. On to the action and treasure hunting. The action are done well, not overstuffed with over the top special effects and not cheesy looking. The movie has a nice pace to it and I enjoyed every destination they went to, they were all important to the movie as a whole. This is pretty enjoyable film that is sure to entertain all audiences. I definitely suggest it for family viewing, it's not too rough or intense or too weak and child like, perfect medium. The kids will have good fun with the treasure hunt and the clues they discover along the way and with the action sequences. And the adults can enjoy that and the interesting interactions between the characters that will probably fly over younger kids heads. 8/10 for national treasure: book of secrets.",8,0,0,11 April 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good sequel, not as good as #1 though
","I personally really enjoyed Kill Bill: Vol. 1. It was full of well written dialogue, featured good performances, and was very entertaining. All of the same things are true for this sequel, although it's not quite as good as the first movie. The cast is a lot of the same, Thurman, Carradine, Hannah, and Madsen are all back and all turn in great performances. Thurman's character is now focusing on the three remaining people that are left on her quest for revenge. I want to focus on these three individuals separately. First, is Michael Madsen. He plays his character very well, he is not very fanatic, he's pretty laid back and chill most of the time, and in a way that makes his character more menacing, because of the ease that comes with his actions. He was a great choice for his role. But ya know who was the absolute perfect choice for their role? Daryl Hannah. Hannah plays Elle, the one eyed ruthless assassin. I adored her performance, she really gave it her all. I was transfixed by her acting ability here, especially since it's a pretty unusual role for her. And of course Thurman was just amazing in the lead, just as she was in Vol. 1. I do suggest this sequel, but only if this is your kind of movie and only if you liked the first film. Well written dialogue, fine performances, and a lot of great action. 8/10.",8,1,2,1 March 2018
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Touching dazzling movie with some comedy sprinkled on top
","In honor of pride month, I decided to watch a movie I could not believe I have never seen before. That movie is of course the adventures of Priscilla Queen of the desert. I can honestly say that it is one of the best LGBTQ films ever made. And just because this is an LGBTQ movie doesn't mean that that's all that it's, it's not. It's is a road trip movie about these three individuals. It's stars Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. Weaving and Pierce play to gay drag queens and Terence Stamp plays an aging transgender woman. They all three decide to get in a bus that they have named Priscilla and drive across the desert to some drag shows they will be performing in in a town called Alice Springs. On this road trip they come across many things: homophobic assaults, they learn secrets about one another, and they get to know each other better through deep meaningful conversations. That's why I call it a touching road trip movie sprinkled with comedy, it is not strictly a comedic film, I would first call it a drama before I would a comedy. The acting is really what holds this movie up, along with the good dialogue and the fantastic costumes (for which the film won an academy award). The one that really shines the most in this movie is Terence Stamp, his performance as the transgender woman Bernadette was absolutely flawless, personally I think he should've gotten an Academy Award nomination. Hugo weaving and Guy Pearce were also very very good in their roles, it's just that Terence stamp really outshined everyone. Guy Pearce was not only very good looking in this role, but he was also very flamboyant and cheery character, so he was kind of the comedic relief of the film, not that the movie was making fun of his being gay or being flamboyant, he was just a very funny character, which was good because it's always good to have a balance of good touching drama with some comedy. The costuming absolutely deserved that Academy award win, they were fabulous and just perfect for the drag shows. The soundtrack is great too. All in all, this is a very well made film and I suggest it to any and everyone. 9/10. Happy Pride Month everyone!!",9,6,9,5 June 2017
Alien 3," Disappointing compared to Aliens
","Alien 3 (1992) is definitely a disappointment compared to the second film in the alien saga. Okay, first of all, I just gotta get this off my chest, hicks and newt DO NOT survive?!! Come on! I loved Hicks, I really did love him as a character in aliens, and newt, the little innocent girl that Ripley went through all that crap to save. I just wish there was a way those characters could have survived. Anyways, now for the rest of this 3rd installment in the series. The script is alright, I mean it's doable, could've been a good bit better though. Sigourney weaver shines as the lead role, as she always does. I didn't care for the whole fanatical religious brotherhood thing that the prison inmates had going on, thought it was weird and annoying. I hated the prison characters, like I just dreaded scenes with them, hearing them talk was annoying to say the least. The alien effects in this movie were lackluster in some shots, like it appeared fake to me, but in other more close up shots, it looks real like in the previous two films. The action was pretty standard, bogging amazing, but not like god awful. This really is just an 'alright' movie overall. I did appreciate the ending, self sacrifice and true heroism. Ripley did what needed to be done against all odds. 6/10 for alien 3.",6,2,3,6 September 2016
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The weakest installment........
","This film was definitely the worst in the franchise, and I do realize that this film was needed In order to set the stage for Breaking Dawn Part 2, but still this film was very dull and really dragged along. The beginning of the movie was fine, but as it went on, it really started to drag, and I was getting bored, and was just begging for something to happen. The big honeymoon scene was well done, not too graphic, but it still showed the romance between Bella and Edward. I did enjoy the honeymoon part of the movie. Later on, is where the problem started, the film really failed to keep the viewers attention, which was disappointing. 3/10 for breaking dawn part 1",3,5,6,3 August 2015
10 Cloverfield Lane," Interesting mystery film
","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is a film that's very intriguing. I love mysterious movies, ones that make you guess what's gonna happen all the way through. There were moments during the movie where It thought for sure that one thing was definitely true, then there would be times where I thought that something completely different was true. And I really love that, it's thrilling and holds your attention. The writing is smart overall and it does a great job of keeping your interest. The cast does a good job at handling their roles, especially John Goodman. Goodman plays his character with a mystery and certain menace that works very well. And I enjoyed the rest of the actors too. The plot is very interesting because it has multiple aspects to it. On one hand, you're thinking about Goodman and who he really is and if he is a good or bad guy, and then you're also thinking about whether or not the outside world is really dangerous and what is happening. I highly suggest this movie if you like this genre, it really is well made. 8/10 for 10 Cloverfield Lane.",8,2,2,26 February 2018
The Sound of Music," Fantastic family friendly musical classic
","The Sound of Music (1965) is an all time classic family musical that has always been one of my favorites. Ever since I was child, I would watch this movie and just love every minute of it. This movie really was destined for greatness from the beginning, anyone at all could have seen that. Between the A list cast, great performances, top notch singing, and the enchanting story.... there's no wonder people still love it to death. Julie Andrews stars as Maria, who is a nun, but not a very good one, and she gets sent to be a governess to the Von Trapp family. The Von Trapp family is a very well to do family in Austria. The father is a former captain and the mother died some time ago. Christopher Plummer plays captain Von Trapp, and he does a great job. Every member of the cast does a great job with their performances, both singing and non. The singing alone in this film is just astounding, every single musical number is just as good, if not better than the previous one. If you do not care for musicals, then I wouldn't really suggest this movie to you. It really is a lot of singing, but it is great singing by talented artists, which is really why it will forever have a place in classic great cinema. 10/10 for The Sound of Music. Enchanting story with lovely entertaining music.",10,17,18,26 October 2017
Ghost," A sweet touching love story
","This movie was a pretty big deal back in 1990 when it was released. It's the story of Patrick Swayze, a man who was killed, trying to contact his girlfriend Demi Moore who is in danger. He contacts with Moore through Whoopi Goldberg, who is a supernatural medium. I love to the actors in this movie and I thought every one of them really nailed their performance. Whoopi Goldberg won her academy award for her supporting performance in this movie, she's funny and delightful as the medium who really isn't aware of her abilities until Patrick Swayze comes into her life. And let me just say that I absolutely adored Demi Moore's performance here, she is one of the best on cue criers I've seen in movies, when she cries in that touching scene where she finally gets to come into contact with her dead boyfriend, it's just the most romantic thing ever and it's her acting that makes it work so well. The actors have great chemistry with one another, Swayze and Goldberg work well on screen and are funny and Demi and Patrick have incredible romantic connection. The visual effects are stunning, especially for back in 1990, that's one of the things this film was praised for back then. All in all, it's not like amazing or breathtaking, but it's an entertaining sweet supernatural love story with great performances. 8/10.",8,4,7,26 April 2017
The Ring," Not as good as I expected
","I'll be completely honest, this movie was not as good as I expected it to be, even though it features a worthy performance by Naomi Watts. The acting really comes through and shines, but if you take the movie as a whole, then it doesn't quite measure up to my own personal standards of horror films. The plot is interesting, watch the weird/creepy video tape, you receive a phone call saying '7 days' in a very low hushed creepy tone of voice. And this of course means that you will in some way die when those next 7 days are up. Naomi Watts's character is trying desperately to figure out why people around her have died from watching this tape and where the tape originated from, what it's background is and how it has these powers to kill. The movie drags in some places, and then it can be thrilling in other places. The big issue I had with the movie was that it just wasn't scary. There wasn't a single moment I thought what was happening was frightening, and that of course is not good for a horror movie. But the reason the rating isn't lower is really just because the lead performance by Watts is so good. 5/10 overall for The Ring (2002). There are better scary flicks out there.",5,0,2,8 March 2017
It," Entertaining but could've been better
","It (2017) was a pretty good movie overall, most of it was entertaining and well made. I will say that it wasn't as good as I expected, there were parts that could have been better. Well first the positives. One of the positives is the acting, great performances were given by all, I was impressed by the child actors, clearly very talented. I think the child actors really committed and showed the level of talent that you'd usually see in an adult actor. The special effects were also very well done. Pennywise's look was well put together and all the wild effects with him looked good. The beginning sequence was very well done, I loved the exchange between Pennywise and Georgie. The middle part of the film was alright, it had good acting and it set up everything for the finale, but to be honest, the beginning and the end were great, very well done, and I felt like the middle portion was alright, but my mind wondered some and I just felt like there wasn't enough substance to the middle part of the movie. Yes, the characters were good and the acting was still good in the middle, but I feel like the story needed more support in that section. I haven't seen the original Tim Curry It miniseries yet, so I cannot compare the two, all I know is that the original is basically like two films in one. I am excited for an It 2, which I feel is on its way since the original had two parts to it. All in all, a 7/10. Overall enjoyable, and I was entertained by the end of it, even though there were places in the movie that could've been better.",7,3,5,18 November 2017
Hereditary," Will go down as a horror masterpiece
","Hereditary (2018) is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. I can say with confidence that this film will go down as a horror masterpiece, and one of the best reviewed horrors ever. It's a both a psychological and supernatural horror, it balances both aspects beautifully. I love that this film didn't have one single cheesy moment, the entire thing was genuinely horrifying and interesting. The story will draw you in and you won't be able to take your eyes away from what's happening onscreen. The acting was very impressive, especially from the star, Toni Collete. Give this woman an academy award for this performance because damn she was incredible, as was everyone else. The script was crafted in a near perfect way because it was strong on the story it was telling, it was creepy, and it did an excellent job at keeping the audiences attention throughout the whole thing. The ending is for sure one of the greatest endings I've ever witnessed, I mean just incredible. Go see this movie! But beware it is NOT for the faint of heart. 10/10 for Hereditary! For sure in my top 10 horror films. Also, A24 is really proving itself time and time again.",10,18,36,14 June 2018
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An incredible, revolutionary film
","Who framed Roger Rabbit (1988) made big, new achievements that no one had seen in Hollywood. Having a full length feature film that has both animated characters and live action was something brand new at that time. And I must say that it all still holds up very well. There wasn't much about this film that I didn't like. The animation is done so well! It's one of my favorite examples of animation in cinema. I love the characters too. Roger is funny and so lovable and fun to watch. Jessica Rabbit is perfectly done, she's sexy, mysterious, and has her funny/amusing moments. She's' voiced beautifully by Kathleen Turner. Bob Hoskins' character, Eddie Valiant (which is a perfect name for this character) is very well put together. He has depth and is fun to watch and root for. Hoskins plays him well too. The writing is just great. It's very funny, light hearted and fun, and everything fits well into the film. This has always been one of my favorites due to the sheer imagination and talent that shows so clearly through every aspect. 9/10 for Who Framed Roger Rabbit!",9,1,2,20 March 2015
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," 'I want the job done tonight!'
","This is what Glenn close said was a great Bible to go by in order to play Cruella DeVil in the 1996 live action update of 101 Dalmatians. This movie was a true childhood obsession for me. I loved the character Cruella so much! I think she may be the best Disney villain of the classic animations. She is for sure the most delicious. Everything about her is so over the top and volcanic. She of course wears her signature black dress with a white fur coat all throughout the movie. Then always smoking a cigarette with a red holder, green smoke bellowing from it constantly. Her design and look to her is so detailed and correct for her kind of character. And then Of course, we have her car, her red classic Cadillac that she drives crazily everywhere. Her driving is so much of who Cruella is lol, I remember loving that as a kid, that's really where most of the action in the film stems from. On to the other characters. Anita and Rodger are great innocent characters that have good romantic chemistry, pongo and perdita are really Rodger and Anita just in animal version. The plot is darker than most current animated films, but kids can handle it, they'll certainly have loads of fun watching these animals try desperately to escape Cruella's clutches. And it's complete with a fun theme song and top notch animation. 9/10 for 101 Dalmatians (1961).",9,2,2,29 April 2017
Se7en," One of best movies ever made!
","This film got everything right! I mean every single casting choice, scene, and line was perfect! This was Brad Pitt's best role in movie, I don't recall a movie where he ever achieved better acting than here. Also, in my opinion, the same goes for Morgan freeman, him and Brad make a great on screen team. The film was a real mind bender, which I love! The dialogue was unbelievably great! The plot was so genius as well. The twist ending was one of the best twist endings I've ever seen hands down! This movie has perfect acting, characters, plot, dialogue, ending, and it definitely keeps your attention throughout, I wasn't bored once, and that's very important to me! 10/10, not a single flaw 👍🏼",10,4,6,13 July 2015
The Big Lebowski," I don't understand why this is loved by so many!
","This movie is truly awful! It's supposed to be some legendary comedy, but it IS NOT funny! This movie is just really weird and stupid. Literally nothing makes sense in it, i hate every character except Julianne Moore's. The dude is so stupid and annoying, and so is John Goodman! I was struggling to understand what in the world the plot was about, and i never laughed, not once! This movie's ONLY saving grace was Julianne Moore, she actually did a good job, and i liked her character, but everything else....nope! 2/10. Save your time for a much better comedy, and just movie in general, such as Plains trains and automobiles, or a million other better ones!",2,21,41,21 April 2015
Coraline," Interesting, unique film
","Coraline is not your average animated film. It is far darker than any animated film I've seen, definitely not for younger children. This film focuses on a pre-teen girl who has just recently moved to a new place with her parents. She discovers a new world where she has everything she could ever want. Wonderful nice parents, great food, beautiful surroundings.... She starts to visit this place regularly, through the little door in the house, and before too long, she begins to realize that this new place might not be so great after all. This place turns out to be a dark place full of trouble. I liked Dakota Fanning as the voice of Coraline, and I also liked Teri Hatcher as the voice of the mother. The animation is done well. The writing is fine, it's not great to be honest, but it's certainly not bad. It's just that I was expecting more than what I got. The plot was interesting, but I do think that the film had more potential. Overall, I suggest Coraline mildly, it's not the best but it's still pretty good.",7,1,1,2 March 2018
This Is the End," Comedy films have reached a new low
","This is the end (2013) was honestly one of the worst films I think I've ever seen! It wasn't funny at all, I mean AT ALL! I didn't even laugh or chuckle one time throughout the whole thing. Seth Rogen was soooo irritating here, I already hated Seth based on his previous roles in films, but this just made me hate him even more! And the rest of the cast was not quite as irritating, but still. The dialogue sucked, so did the acting as a matter of fact. Also, the loaded up WAYY too much on the non stop crude/sexual humor, it got to where it was just over blown, stupid, and annoying. Channing Tatum's cameo was the only part I actually enjoyed, and that's kinda sad. This movies was just dumb all the way around, except for the 10 seconds of Channing Tatum, that just about sums it up. 2/10",2,4,9,29 July 2015
Dawn of the Dead," Pretty well made remake
","I won't be comparing this remake to the original dawn of the dead film because I haven't seen it. I'm just going to review it as a regular movie as if it wasn't even a remake. The movie begins with a nurse at her suburban home with her husband. They go to sleep and the next morning she finds a neighborhood girl that has been turned into a zombie and she of course runs to her car and escapes. She then discovers the zombie epidemic that has claimed the city in which she lives, and ultimately everywhere. She some other survivors drives to the mall and take refuge there. The acting is pretty good, all the actors give believable performances. The scare factor is definitely there, I thought the zombie attacks were creepy and had a very suspenseful feel to it. The only thing I didn't like as far as the killings go was the accidental ones, there's one character that accidentally gets killed by another survivor and I thought that was pretty stupid. That's really my only complaint as far as that goes, I wouldn't have minded if they were a little less gory but that didn't bother me all too much. The writing was fairly decent, better than your average horror film, which is refreshing to see. The movie has a high entertainment value, which is the only reason anyone would ever want to watch this movie. 8/10 for Dawn of the Dead.",8,1,1,15 April 2017
Iron Man 2," Maybe I'm just not an iron man fan
","Iron Man 2 was actually pretty dull and boring, I found. Robert Downey Junior as the lead just did not work, just like it didn't in the first. I don't know why but Robert just doesn't represent Iron man. Although I did enjoy Gwenyth Paltrow in the supporting role of Pepper Potts, as i did in the first installment, I really think that was a good casting choice. The villains weren't that good at all, I thought they were boring and lifeless, not much too them. Scarlet Johansen was very fitting in her role as black widow, very believable and works well in the action sequences! The dialogue wasn't that good at all, this movie seemed pretty lazy in that department. Overall, just a pretty boring superhero film: 5/10",5,1,3,15 July 2015
Alien: Resurrection," Better than Alien 3
","I will say that alien resurrection is better than its predecessor, Alien 3. But it is not nearly as great as aliens, no other Alien movie will be, because it is incredible in ever way. This movie once again, stars Sigourney weaver, and co stars Winona Ryder. I really loved Winona Ryder here, I loved her character and how she played that character. Sigourney is good here as usual, well, her character is very different in this final movie, Ripley is a clone, the real human Ripley is of course dead. So, at the beginning, I wasn't really enjoying her character because she is just so empty and hollow. But as the movie goes on, her character gets better and becomes more real, which is good. The action here is pretty good, again, it'll never compare to aliens, but it's still pretty nice. If you cannot stand gore, then you may wanna think twice about seeing this movie, or see it edited, the bloodshed in this film is a good bit stronger than in the previous ones. I do think they took the goriness too far in a few scenes towards the end. But I did love the ending, the newborn was very cool looking and I think the effects were very good looking during the birth scene, the effects throughout were nicely done. But dealing with the birth scene in particular, the effects NEEDED to be top notch, and they definitely were, that scene was just very cool looking and interesting. So overall, the acting is pretty good, the writing suffices, and the action/effects work. Not the best in the franchise, but certainly not the worst. 7/10 for alien resurrection.",7,2,4,18 September 2016
World War Z," Has its ups and big downs....
","World War Z starring Brad Pitt is an uneven movie. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. But unfortunately the times it's not good outweighed the times it's good. Brad Pitt is a very talented actor and I've loved him in other movies. And he's not necessarily bad in this film, it's just that the script is kinda lackluster and there are pretty long stretches of time that are just dull and uninteresting. That is one of my number one pet peeves in films, long dull stretches of nothing. I don't mind a longer film or a slow burner at all, with some movie that's just necessary, but I didn't think it was with this movie. They could have at least thrown in some interesting well written dialogue when nothing with the zombies was happening. The special effects were pretty good and so were the action sequences. But the other stuff wasn't all too interesting, just kind of dull and boring. And that's so sad because I think so much more could have been done with World War Z. It had some good potential, but that potential just wasn't taken advantage of. I'm sorry to say that I cannot recommend World War Z. 4/10.",4,5,7,9 April 2017
Passengers," Not at all the kind of film I expected
","When I first saw the first trailer for Passengers, I thought that there would be bad guys and an evil maniacal plot against the main characters, I thought it would be a sci-fi mystery thriller. But that is not at all what it is. Don't go into this film expecting all that, because you will be disappointed if you do, well you'll be disappointed if that's what you want. This ultimately is a tragic romance set in space with sci-fi elements. And given that that's what it is, the movie succeeds, it knows what it is and it plays along with that plot well. Pratt and Lawrence have good romantic on screen chemistry and the love scenes between them work well because you can clearly see the feelings they share. The visual effects are absolutely STUNNING! I really loved seeing the spectacular imagery, whether it was seeing out the windows into space, or seeing humongous stars as the starship passed by, it was all designed so well, and it deserves the two academy award nominations it received. If you know what this movie is and you embrace it for that, then I think you'll really enjoy it. I know I did. 10/10 for Passengers!",10,1,2,12 March 2017
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not as great as everyone says.....
","Forgetting Sarah Marshall isn't like a 10/10, but it's not horrible. Kristen bell is pretty good and funny in her starring role as Sarah Marshall. Mila kunis is alright, this isn't like the best I've seen her in, but she sufficed. Paul Rudd was annoying, didn't like him at all here. Jason Segal is good, he nailed the comedy and even some more dramatic scenes, had both down. As far as Russell Brand goes, eh, I have mixed feelings about him in this movie, at times I was laughing, then in other times I was thinking oh dear god why is this happening right now. The script and the dialogue is funny sometimes, well most of the time, it's never really bad, just had its shining moments and it's alright moments. Now I did kinda take some issue with Jason's full frontal male nudity, it was meant to be comical, but I felt more uncomfortable then amused, especially since he isn't particularly all that physically attractive (sorry :/). So yah Forgetting Sarah Marshall gets a 7/10.",7,1,2,18 April 2016
Zootopia," Pretty darn good
","Zootopia really is pretty darn good. The actors that voice the different characters really were picked well. Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, and shakira were great leading voices amongst others. The plot is very interesting and also teaches a very good moral lesson. The writing is very clever, funny and irresistibly entertaining. The action sequences were well done and fun to watch. The animation here is very state of the art and well done. The events that lead up to the very interesting ending are all very fun, smart, and entertaining. This movie keeps your undivided attention, that's for sure. The lesson this film teaches and depicts is a very good message, especially for the younger crowd. Children, teenagers, and adults will all love this fun ride. Disney has done it once again. Go out and have a little fun with Zootopia! 8/10.",8,13,24,25 March 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Entertaining Disney fun
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) is the first film in the Disney Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. This franchise has been a humongous money maker for Disney. This first movie introduces us to what is probably one of the most widely known characters ever know, Captain Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. This really is an interesting character. I'm not a big fan of Johnny Depp, but I will say that he was the correct pick for this character, I've really taken issue with how he represents characters before (Charlie and the chocolate factory), but this time I think he did a good job. His character is complicated because on one hand, he is someone we root for and someone we're amused by because of his humorous nature and personality, and then on the other hand, he's a flawed character that steals and cheats others. But it's a whole lot of fun to watch Johnny Depp plays this humorous captivating character, hence his academy award nomination. We are also introduced to Will, played by the ever handsome Orlando Bloom. Will is one of the most commendable characters you'll ever see, he's a noble charming character who everyone has no choice but to root for. And then we have Keira Knightly playing Elizabeth. She plays Blooms love interest. But what I loved about her role is that she's isn't just some female for Bloom, she is not a damsel in distress. Yes, it's great to see her and Will fall in love and to see their great romantic chemistry, but it's also awesome to see Elizabeth stand up for herself and take charge in different scenes. She played her in a very bad ass way, which makes it so much fun to watch. The plot of course revolves around pirates invading and these characters I've told you about going up against them. There's more to it than that of course but that's the basic overall plot. I really enjoy watching this now ever famous film. It deserves the positive reception it received when it came out. 8/10 for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.",8,0,0,26 November 2017
The English Patient," An epic love story
","This winner of nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, is truly an epic. It stars Ralph Fiennes, Kristen Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, and Colin Firth. The plot centers around Fiennes's character, Count Laszlo, falling in love with a married woman, Katherine, played by Thomas. All of this story is told in flashbacks. An older, dying Count Laszlo is being cared for by a war nurse, played by Binoche, who gives a fine performance. Binoche gives the strongest performance of all, earning her an academy award. The script is emotional, touching, and emphasizes the connections between the characters involved. I loved the chemistry between Thomas and Fiennes, it is a wonderful love story to watch. Also, the connection that Hana and Laszlo share is something very special. Love is at the center of this entire film, and it will touch you in a deep way, or at least that's the experience I had with it. I suggest this very well made film to those who like epics. It is not the best film ever, but it is certainly a very good one. 8/10 for The English Patient.",8,0,0,18 December 2017
Hostel," Pretty good horror with some faults
","This film starts out with 2 good looking college age guys and a drifter they picked up while backpacking. We see them wondering around in Amsterdam, doing drugs, drinking, ya know typical college kid antics. They then talk to one guy who informs them about a hostel in Slovakia where there are 'unbelievably hot girls'. Now of course they get excited and decide to go to this place. First of all, I would like to compliment Jay Hernandez and his co-star on their acting, they were very convincing in the lead roles of this movie, I enjoyed them here. The sexual content was just a little too much for my taste, I didn't care to see so much nudity, and the nudity was all female too, no male nudity, so sorry ladies and gay guys, but to be serious, the female nudity got to be a little overwhelming. The violence in this film is very graphic and will disturb some viewers, it is important to go ahead and be aware of that when u go in to watch this film. Also the two main characters in the film really are good guys, I mean yes they did a little drugs and drank and had some sex, but that doesn't make then bad guys necessarily. This movie really made me care about the 2 main guys. One of the guys really does have a big heart and is sweet and nice. Now, the violence includes an image of a severed head, it shows a girl about to get her toe chopped off, it doesn't actually show everything, but you know what is about to happen, there is also an offscreen showing of a guy getting drilled, and more stuff similar to those type of things. Just wanted to let you know all this, because if you are faint of heart, then this movie is definitely one to skip over. Now, I enjoyed the script for this movie, the script and dialogue worked very well, and nothing was cheesy and cliché about it. I really loved the atmosphere in this movie, the building in which things go on was very creepy and very atmospherically creepy. This premise of this movie is very interesting, I liked how they executed the plot. Now is the movie's violence too brutal? I think it is a little too graphic for my own personal taste, I was expecting it to be brutal, but they took the torture scenes just a little too far in my opinion. But hey it could've been much worse, movies like saw, and others of that kind have been much worse, so I am thankful that it wasn't any worse than it was. At least some things occurred offscreen and just showed screaming and the victims reaction. There is some justice served here, one of the torturers does in fact get what he deserves, so it's not like evil triumphs in this movie. A couple victims do in fact vomit while in the torture room, from fear and just sheer shock I suppose, that wasn't really pleasant, but I guess it was realistic. The movie shows very graphic images of carnage: severed hands, legs, rooms with cut open bodies and blood on the floor. Yes, some of this aftermath and carnage was an overload and was too grain graphic and unnecessary. And there is one scene in particular that was just NASTY, I mean it was very disturbing, that was the scene where one of the victims is shown hiding and sees a guy just sawing severed limbs with a chainsaw and other instruments, too graphic for my taste. Oh and also the eye scene was wayyyyy too nasty and disturbing, that was just unnecessary. Although I am glad that the characters in this movie weren't like bad people, the main characters were good guys, that was refreshing to see. This movie was not the best in the world, but it certainly was not a bad movie, it was a 7/10, I have to take off points for the overwhelming gross out imagery that didn't improve the movie, but in fact made it worse, and in my opinion, dumbed it down. But it gets points for being well written, that includes script and characters, and being well acted. And I assure you that the bad guys do not go unpunished. Hostel ended on a good and a bad note, a partially happy ending. I won't go any further about how it ends, you'll have to see for yourself, that is if you are in fact brave enough. Enter at your own risk.",7,0,0,16 January 2016
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Very well constructed film adaptation
","Narnia is a book a series that I admittedly have not read, not a single one, but I have seen the film adaptations of those best selling books. This first installment is the best of all of them in my humble opinion. First of all, let's start with the sets. The film's sets are so on point for the time period this is set in, its very historically accurate and they all have great visual attraction to them. The Narnia scenery is beautiful, breathtaking views of snowy mountains, then of all a sudden, the season suddenly turns to a wonderful spring day, complete with trickling rivers, budding flowers, and a huge battlefield, which is where the big final battle takes place. The actors really handle their characters very well, all the teens are great actors/actresses and they all show great potential, especially Peter. Tilda Swinton is absolutely incredible as the White Queen, there couldn't have been a better choice to play the wicked antagonistic role. Tilda brings a certain cold, distant, and effortlessly evil presence to the role, which works very well. The writing is very good, it adds a good bit of character depth, which is pretty rare with movies starring teenagers. The effects, makeup (Oscar nomination), and the action sequences are all so intricate and well done. Especially the makeup, that is a very important factor for some characters in here. I suggest kids, teens and adults all see this if you haven't already had the pleasure. 9/10.",9,0,0,15 March 2017
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Might be the best romantic comedy ever made
","I saw this movie some time ago, but never got around to reviewing it for some reason. Anyways, like I said in the description, this is definitely one of the best romantic comedies I think has ever been made. The actors portray their characters wonderfully, and the characters themselves are just so well written and gave depth to them. The dialogue in and the writing is hilarious where it needs to be and touching and heartwarming where it needs to be. Julianne Moore and Steve Carell have undeniable chemistry between each other, and that chemistry is definitely electric and alive. Also Julianne Moore is so hilarious here, she made me cry with laughter in several scenes. Steve Carrel is perfect here, no other actor could've done this character justice like he did. Also Marisa Tomei was very funny even though she wasn't in a lot of the movie. This movie is definitely not shallow, it's very deep with a lot of that subject matter and it really shows how intelligent the writing is. The comedy is top niche and the writing and acting is also of the highest possible quality. Ryan gosling and Emma stone do their jobs well and carry their characters all of their own. Stone and gosling also have great chemistry with each other, and that works well. There really isn't any downsides or negatives to this movie. I can't think of anything that didn't work well. 10/10 for Crazy Stupid Love.",10,1,2,25 May 2016
The Notebook," Enchanting love story
","Who in the world doesn't know about the classic romance film, The Notebook. The movie is based off the very popular Nicolas Sparks novel. The cast includes A list actors and actresses: Gena Rowlands, James Garner, Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling, and Joan Allen. The performances by every actor is very skilled and spot on. I loved the chemistry between both Garner and Rowlands and between Gosling and McAdams. Their on screen love really does win the viewer over. The movie brings you into their story and all the complexities of it and makes you care about what happens to them in the end. We see the two fall in love when they're younger and we see them go through many ups and downs, then we see them years later when they're older, and your attention never strays. Not once. You don't lose interest because the actors and the writing is so well done. Nothing is boring or dull. If you like tasteful sweet sometimes steamy romance stories, then I definitely recommend The Notebook (2004). 8/10!",8,1,2,9 August 2017
The Danish Girl," Beautifully acted story of first transgender female
","Tom Hooper's The Danish Girl tells the story of one of the first transgender females, at least one of the first, if not THE first one to undergo the sex change surgery. Set in 1926, the sets are very well designed and accurate to the time period. The makeup used in the film is fantastic, very beautiful classic style of makeup, the makeup has to be good for a film of this kind, it just has to be. The sequence where Einer is putting on his makeup for the first time is breathtaking visually and very well done. I loved the costume design for each individual character, especially lili. The costumes that lili wore suited her so very well and she looked absolutely beautiful in all of them. And Alicia Vikander looks great in both her makeup and tee various costumes. Now we get to the best part of the entire film, and that is the performances by the actors. We'll start with the academy award winning performance given by Alicia Vikander. Vikander gives a truly moving, deep performance that is rooted in love and rife with strong emotion throughout. Her character goes through a lot as you can imagine. Eddie Redmayne is such a marvelous actor! He plays both Einer and lili sooo well. The way in which he behaves, talks and behaves as lili is so skilled and natural, you never feel like you're watching Eddie act, it feels real. There are a couple of scenes I would like to recognize because they were so needed and crucial to this film. One scene is where Einer is nude in front of a mirror and he tucks his penis in between his legs and it looks like he now has a vulva, this is a crucial scene that HAD to be included, it showcase his character's journey to self discovery. Another is Einer visiting a peep show to see a nude woman and see how she moves and examine/mimic her mannerisms, another scene showcasing self discovery. I feel the ending was handled fairly well, no complaints about that. Moving, well acted, visually great looking and important story. 8/10",8,1,3,13 March 2017
Elizabeth," Good portrayal of Elizabeth's rise to the throne of England
","Elizabeth is a realistic portrayal of Queen Elizabeth's ascendance to the throne of England. The casting is good, from the exquisite Cate Blanchett to the fine Joseph Fiennes. Blanchett does a wonderful job at portraying Elizabeth and her Oscar nomination was very well deserved. The production of the film is great. The costumes are wonderfully designed and historically accurate. The makeup is spot on too, hence the Oscar win for best makeup. The movie begins with a scene of 'heretics' (people who renounced or went against the Catholic Church being burned, by the order of Queen Mary, aka Bloody Mary. Then we see Mary's death and Elizabeth's ascendance to the throne. It is very uncertain times and her ascendance is a turbulent one, and the film depicts it all very well. The middle part of the movie may have some viewers drifting, since it is slightly slow moving, but the ending is worth staying around for in my opinion. This film is not in the greatest movies of all time category, and it shouldn't be. It's not amazing, but it is well made, and really does the source material justice, and if you are a student studying this time period, or just really interested in history, then I suggest it. 7/10.",7,0,0,15 January 2017
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Pretty entertaining action fantasy film
","This is one movie I'd definitely recommend to families with late elementary/middle school aged kids. It's not overly cheesy or dumbed down in my opinion. The casting is spot on too, Gylanhaal is perfect for the lead role and Kingsley sure is a great villain, very believable and fitting for the character. The dialogue is typical action/fantasy movie type stuff, nothing really surprising or anything that breaks the mold, but I didn't really see that as a bad thing, I received what I was expecting on the writing front and was happy with it. The special effects and visuals were pretty good looking, nothing that'll win many awards, but not fake looking or cheap by any means. The costume design was another thing I liked, Jake Gylanhaal's period piece costume fit his bodily Physique very well, and his body was very in shape for this movie, another reason he was good for the character. Gemma Arterton was good. The acting was overall good, and the entertainment value was definitely there, which is ultimately the sole purpose for this movie existing. This movie and other movies like this exist only for the purpose of being pure popcorn fun, entertaining the audience and giving them a fun ride to enjoy. And Prince of Persia: Sands of Time did that for me. 7/10.",7,2,2,19 March 2017
Batman Returns," My favorite batman film ever!!!! Luv it in every part
","This Tim Burton film, batman returns is definitely the darkest of the 4. But I love the way they portrayed Catwoman and the Penguin. Michelle Pfeiffer was the PERFECT choice for Catwoman, sexy and mysterious, just the way Catwoman should be. I think that this film is far better than the 1989 Batman. And seriously there is no one better to play the Penguin than Danny Daveito. And the script was very very sharp. I loved every scene in this movie. And Michael Keaton was great as Batman just like in the first film. And I also love the way Burton made Gotham look very slick and cool. Now, many parents were unhappy with this film being darker than the original, and I do understand that, but Really it wasn't all that terribly dark to me. I just think maybe some of those parents were sheltering they're child a little too much. Sooo pleased with this movie. Really, the best one in the 4 filmed franchise. Batman (1989): 6/10 Batman Returns (1992): 9/10 Batman Forever (1995): 7/10 Batman and Robin (1997): 7/10",9,1,2,15 February 2015
Finding Nemo," One of my absolute favorites!
","Finding Nemo is hands down one of my favorite films of all time, and it's not just one of my favorite animated films, but it's one of my favorite films period. The first thing I'd like to cover is the perfect casting for the voices of the characters. Ellen DeGeneres is so perfect to play Dory. Her voice fits the forgetful fish so well! And it works well in the comedic scenes because Ellen is an accomplished comedian, so it makes scenes like speaking in whale hilarious. Albert Brooks is a good fit to voice marlin the clownfish, fits the overprotective nervous single father role well. And the script has such great skillful writing that it gives the characters hilarious lines when it's supposed to be funny, and sentimental/touching when the moment calls for it. The screenplay really did deserve an academy award nomination. The dialogue really gets deep with the character development. It's not just silliness, the movie really focuses on not only the father-son relationship between marlin and Nemo, but also on Dory and her being alone in life and finding solace and peace in the newfound friendship with both marlin and nemo. Animated movies that will please both children and adults like this one is sure to. It's got a little something in it for everyone to enjoy. It's hard for me to believe that there's people out there who still to this day have not seen finding nemo, but I'm sure they're out there, and if you're one of them, go fix this problem! See this great animated classic! 10/10!",10,0,1,9 April 2017
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," A cute rom com
","This movie is a very cute and well made romantic comedy. This movie well casted as well, Kate Hudson and Matthew are great in this movie, and they also have wonderful chemistry. The script is well written too, and the dialogue between all the characters is well constructed. The romance Is really cute and it's believable because of the great chemistry the leads share. There is also good comedy to be enjoyed here, lots of very amusing lines and scenes. I think If you enjoy a well made romantic comedy with good acting, then this is the one for you. 8/10 for How to lose a guy in 10 days. That's really all there is to it, I strongly recommend how to lose a guy in 10 days.",8,2,3,16 February 2016
Constantine," Had potential to be better
","This film definitely could've been better, i'm not saying it was awful, but I'm just saying that it could have been better that what it turned out to be. I liked Keanu Reeves, I thought he really brought it with his performance, he was tough, and sympathetic, but yet had a hard exterior, he portrayed Constantine well here. Rachel Weisz was pretty good in her co- starring role, she was dramatic and had depth in her performance. I also quite enjoyed Tilda Swinton as Gabriel the angel, I think Swinton brought a lot of depth and a lot of interesting layers to her role. The special effects were all around all right, I've of course seen much better, and a few times they looked slightly hokey, but most of the time they were alright. Shia Lebough is alright too, it's of course one of his younger and first feature film roles, he sufficed in the screen time given to him. As far action goes, there is definitive action sequences that are full of shooting, like punching, and throwing people across rooms, so the action will for sure satisfy. The middle part of the film does in fact drag a bit, so I definitely had to complain about that, the middle was a little bit of a chore to sit through, which is why the rating is not higher than a 6/10 on my movie rating scale.",6,1,2,19 April 2016
The Others," One of the most spine chilling flicks ever made
","The Others (2001) truly is a blood curdling, bone chilling suspense movie that will surely scare anyone watching while watching. The chills in this film stem from the unknown, and subtle noises, whispers and voices coming from within the house. Nicole Kidman gives a fantastic performance here as the lead, a mother of two living in a secluded home while her husband is away fighting in WWII. Nicole has a great attitude/atmosphere about her throughout the entire film. Most of the movie she has a kind of tragic look on her face, and given her circumstances in life it's completely appropriate and called for. The way she handles scenes that are very intense and frightening is not only believable, but her acting lifts up the scare factor to a new level, which the actors in films like this must do. If the cast of a scary suspense film cannot do that then the movie as a whole will suffer. The child actors did a fine job as well, very impressive for their age. The daughter especially did very good job, her role requires more screen time than the son and the daughter has some pretty intense scenes with her mother (Kidman). The ending is brilliant in my opinion and I very much enjoyed the end result, it adds to the overall effect of the film. 10/10 for the others. Supernatural thrillers like this are pretty rare so I suggest watching it if haven't already had the pleasure.",10,0,0,21 March 2017
Troy," Awesome film, SOOO underrated, seriously it's a great film!!!
","Great film!! I don't know what film people who hate this movie saw! Cus If they would've seen this film, they would've loved it!!! This is a fantastic adaption of Homers classic tale. Brad pitt, Orlando Bloom, Peter O'toole, Eric Bana and Rose Byrne all nailed it with their acting!! Even though the ending was beyond sad!! I hated that Troy fell, just because I hated the Greeks and their king!! I am very grateful that they showed Rose Byrne killing The evil king, and I'm also glad that the others escaped in time. But really I have no idea why the reviews were mixed and not all positive!! I was entertained throughout the film!! And after all that IS what a film is supposed to do for you! I was soo emotionally engaged, it made me care about all the characters, who I wanted to live and who I wished to die. I'm giving Troy a 9/10 rating. Great job Wolfgang Peterson!!",9,0,0,6 March 2015
Just Go with It," It's better than you might anticipate
","Just go with it starring Jennifer Aniston and Adam sandler really is better than I expected. Jennifer Aniston is charming and funny as ever, she and Sandler have surprisingly good chemistry. Some of the script and dialogue really is funny, which is another surprising part, considering that Sandler films aren't usually my cup of tea, just take mr deeds for example, how the hell does that movie have a higher rotten tomatoes rating that just go with it? Like seriously I wanna know. But anyways, the comedy is good and Brooklyn Decker is good too, she wasn't just a hot body, don't get me wrong plenty of the comments are made about that, but she brings more to the character than that. I loved Nicole Kidman as Devlin Adams, she plays her character very very well. Also, I loved the pretty scenery, and the environment of the movie. I liked the ending too, maybe a tad cliché, but it's cute nonetheless. Just go with it gets a big 8/10 overall.",8,0,0,7 April 2016
Brokeback Mountain," Get the tissues ready!
","Brokeback mountain is the heartbreaking story of two gay cowboys who secretly carry on a relationship for years and years. This is truly the best LGBT film ever made, it is captivating, well acted, beautifully written, and well directed by Ang Lee. The two main actors the star in this are Jake gylanhall and Heath ledger. The movie starts out with them meeting one summer to work and ranch on Brokeback mountain, and there that's where their bond and connection begins, I cannot even begin to say how well Jake and Heath pulled this off, especially as two straight men in real life, in my opinion they were both cheated out of their Oscar wins. The connection and the romance that they share together is so real and so captivating to the audience, although Heath's character is so scared to be himself and is so scared he might be judged by society that he will not enter into a full on relationship with Jake's character, Jack. They both go their separate ways and eventually both get married to women and have children, but while they are married and living their lives, they still meet secretly on Brokeback mountain to have 'fishing trips'. That is what is so heartbreaking about this film is that they clearly want to be together and are in love but their lives will not allow them to be together fully. Also Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are both so real and so incredible in this movie. They both deliver top-notch acting performances. This movie teaches that society must accept people that are different, the LGBT I mean, because truthfully if society and people wouldn't have been so judgmental than the two main characters probably could've lived together happily forever. Unfortunately towards the end of the film a tragic event happens and Jack dies. I do think that this was a clever good ending, no it is not a happy ending but it is still a clever one. This is truly one of the best films ever, and if you are a parent of a 16 or 17- year-old teenager, then I would strongly suggest watching it with them. Yes, there is one gay sex scene, but it is not long and it is not graphic, this movie truly needs to be seen by everyone. And if you don't agree with homosexuality, than this movie might just shine a different light on it, and it might make you have second thoughts about it. 10/10!",10,3,4,9 June 2016
Orphan," Loved this great horror movie!
","Orphan (2009) really is a great horror film! The acting, the storyline/plot, and the execution of that plot is all done very very well, and all in an entertaining way! The movie revolves around Esther, a 9 year old orphan girl who is adopted by a married couple with 2 children. They decide to adopt because their 3rd child was a stillborn. Vera Farmiga turns in a terrific performance as Kate Coleman, and so does Peter Sarsgaard as John Coleman. And Isabelle Fuhrman is awesome as Esther!! I mean she really does give it her all in this starring role, she's menacing, innocent seeming when she needs to be, and shows great potential for such a young actress. The plot seems pretty cut and dry at first, family adopts killer evil kid, there certainly has been killer kid movies before, but this one sets itself apart from movies like case 39, or The Omen, you'll have to go and watch it though, I never spoil movies in reviews. The movie is successful in keeping the suspense and chill going throughout the entire movie. I 100% suggest this movie if you like a really well made horror film. 9/10!",9,1,2,11 January 2017
Spotlight," Well deserved best picture award winner
","Spotlight is one of the best films I have ever seen. The story/plot, which is based off of true events is a deeply disturbing one. This movie centers around Spotlight, which is an investigative journalist group of reporters at The Boston Globe, and how they investigate the Catholic Church turning a blind eye and ultimately covering up many many priests physically molesting children. The movie does a wonderful job telling this very eye opening shocking story. The actors are a big factor in how powerful and effective the movie is. Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schriver, and Stanley Tucci all turn in great performances. It's my personal opinion that Ruffalo shines the brightest hear and his Oscar nomination is well deserved. Also what makes the film so moving and well made is the writing. The script for the film is very well put together/thought out and it does a great job at doing the true story justice, it takes you to a place of deep emotion. It's just the right runtime too, it's not an overly long film, it's just at two hours, any shorter and it wouldn't be doing the whole story justice, and too much longer would have been stretching it. I thought hearing the victims explain their stories in sometimes graphic detail was absolutely necessary, as McAdams says in one scene: 'the language is going to be very important'. Also the film clearly states and makes it clear that this has nothing to do with being gay, I loved that the filmmakers stated that because molestation can and is often used by overly conservative people as for a reason why people are gay. The very serious and heartbreaking issue that the film tackles is a story that everyone needs to hear and be educated about. This isn't fluff entertainment but it's a powerful important well made film. 10/10.",10,0,0,13 March 2017
L.A. Confidential," Entertaining mystery film
","L.A. Confidential (1997) is a crime drama/mystery film that has gone down in cinema history as one of the best films ever made. It is a great film, that's for damn sure. They did so many things right with it, from the acting to the clever dialogue. The acting and the cast is probably my favorite thing about this film. Russell Crowe, one of my favorite actors, gives a fine performance here as Sgt. White. His character has depth and is interesting, thanks to the writing and Crowe's skills with acting. Guy Pearce is great here, playing a hated cop, who has just been promoted to lieutenant. I loved how he played his character and the dynamic between him and the other characters. Kim Basinger gives what is probably her best performance. This was Academy Award win for best supporting actress, a win that she so deserved. I can feel her raw emotion in every single moment of her beautiful performance.The writing is great too, I was intrigued by the dialogue, especially when it involved Basinger's character. Very smart and quick, kept things interesting. I hate a film with poorly written dialogue, it's sloppy and you wills surely lose the audiences attention. Thank god this writer knew what he was doing. The editing was done well and I adored the costumes and set designs. I suggest L.A. Confidential as an interesting crime/mystery drama.",8,1,1,9 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Entertaining third installment
","This third movie in the pirates of the Caribbean film series is entertaining. The movie contains good performances by talented A list actors. The visual effects are pretty impressive, they aren't 'dazzling', they're very dark actually. Johnny Depp is the same as always, very brooding at times yet mostly comedic, that is captain jack sparrow. The same is true for all the characters in the movie, they don't change at all in this movie, they are the exact same as in black pearl and dead man's chest. The movie has average script writing, I really enjoyed Knightley and Bloom's storyline and how that turned out in the end, to me that was one of the best parts of the entire movie, I loved the last scene, very touching and sweet. And trust me sweet is not the word to describe the rest of the film. I'd say if you enjoyed the previous two installments, then you should like At Worlds End fairly well. 7/10.",7,0,1,12 March 2017
X-Men," A pretty good action film
","X-Men (2000) is of course the first film in the X-Men franchise. Of course, Hugh Jackman was amazing in this film, as he is in everything else. Hugh just really fits the role of Wolverine, it's almost the role he was born to play, he was rugged, sexy, tough and very likable. Also Anna Paquin was perfect for her role, and her and Hugh have awesome chemistry together. The script was pretty well written too. Also the action sequences were entertaining and fun to watch and enjoy. What I do like about this movie is that it's pretty intelligently written and filmed, it's not just one of those mindless run of the mill action romps. I have not watched the rest of the films in X-Men movie series, but after seeing this first movie, I do plan to see the rest of them sometime soon. I would suggest X-Men (2000). 7/10.",7,1,2,22 January 2016
Milk," Penn turns in a masterful performance
","One thing can for sure be said about Milk (2008), and that is that Sean Penn turns in a masterful, beyond accurate performance. He portrays gay rights advocate Harvey Milk wonderfully. And James Franco is great here too, I absolutely loved him and his character in this film. The chemistry between Penn and Franco is believable and I for one really rooted for their relationship. Josh Brolin plays murderer Dan White very accurately, and I commend him on a great performance. Dustin Lance Black wrote a great award winning script that works so well for the film. And the love/romantic scenes between Milk and his lovers are well shot and tastefully done. The movie shows the ups and downs of milk's life and how he fought tooth and nail for LGBT rights in San Francisco, California, and ultimately across the United States. I do personally feel like the movie could have been just a little stronger overall, but I still feel like this was a great representation of Harvey Milk's remarkable life. Milk (2008) receives a 7/10.",7,1,3,6 March 2017
The Prestige," Watch closely.....
","The Prestige is an amazing movie. This film is sure to blow away any and all audience members. From the superb acting displayed in every single scene to the terrifically well thought out storyline and writing. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are 2 very gifted actors and that is ever present all throughout the prestige, they have impeccable chemistry between themselves and all the other co stars they are performing on screen with. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca hall are great here too, they both gave focused, intense performances. The plot seems rather simple and like there is not much to it by simply reading it on IMDb, but not everything is as it seems ;). This film is full of so many twists and turns that you'll have to really really watch closely.... As any audience at a magic show would. The movie leaves you feeling amazed and rethinking the scenes in the movie, piecing it all together drawing conclusions. Christopher Nolan is a truly truly talented filmmaker, that becomes evident and obvious to any viewer of this movie. 10/10 for the prestige, it's not hard at all to see why it's in the top rated 150 films. Oh and a shout-out to Michael cane, killed it, as always.",10,0,1,13 August 2016
Sleepy Hollow," A visually stunning piece of work
","I am a big fan of this re-telling of the sleepy hollow tale. I love the style of look of the film! Everything is Gothic and dark looking, which it should be. I loved Miranda Richardson, she out of all the actors did the best job in my opinion. And I loved the twist about her being the one that controlled the Horseman, didn't see it coming. Christina Ricci was a great casting choice also, really nailed her performance! Johnny Depp was OK, not really impressed with him In this film. Would've rather seen someone else in the role of Ichobad Crane. I do love the special effects and visuals, This happens to be my personal favorite of all the Tim Burton films, I feel like this was his shining glory! 8/10 overall!",8,1,1,11 April 2015
Silent Hill," Incoherent gross mess
","Silent hill is just a big fat mess! This film makes absolutely no sense, it's disgusting and confusing. It's very difficult to keep up with this movie, I had to rewind so many times just to try and understand what the heck is going on. This movie had way to much blood and just gross effects throughout. I like the actors in it, that's basically the only reason I'm giving this film a 2 and not a 1. The cast did their best and were pretty enjoyable. But the plot was weird, confusing, and muddled. The visuals were alright I guess, nothing all that dazzling. The ending is weird and I honestly don't even want to try to understand it, this movie is not worth trying to understand. The dialogue is almost comically bad, and the acting is iffy with some characters and somewhat better with others. The creatures were not even scary, they were just gross and weird. Do yourself a favor and just don't see this atrocity. God I can't even imagine what the sequel is like based on this. 2/10 for silent hill.",2,0,2,15 January 2016
The Hateful Eight," Fantastic Tarentino film!
","I haven't seen many Tarentino films, only the two Kill Bills and now this one, but I can say that if all the rest of his films are like this one, then I'm forever a fan. This is a fantastic film, it does everything right. The storytelling and the acting is what really stands out here. This film is told in chapters, and each chapter is essential to the overall story. Samuel L. Jackson gives an incredible performance here, ofcourse he never phones it in, but this performance is especially strong. The other one that really shines here is Jennifer Jason Leigh, she really shows her great acting abilities here as Daisy. Very deserving of that Academy Award nomination. The other cast members do great too, very focused and committed. The film is a claustrophobic western mystery film. I love that the film is vague and doesn't give you much to go off of. I was thoroughly entertained and never bored. How could I be bored with such great writing and such great acting? 10/10!",10,0,1,9 July 2018
"I, Tonya"," Some of the best performances of the year!
","I, Tonya (2017) is a film about the true story of Tonya Harding, the former Olympic ice skater. I didn't know much about this, I mean I was born in 1999, so it was interesting to see this and learn all about it. The awards show season is really what lead me to watching this film. I can for sure say that the awards are well deserved. Probably the best thing this film has going for it is the acting. Margot Robbie, Allison Janney, and Sebastian Stan all turn in great performances. Robbie is such a talented actress and she really does a great job at embodying Tonya Harding. But really the actor that shines the brightest is definitely Janney, she plays the b**ch mother and she plays it very well. I mean it's truly one of the best performances I've ever seen. The script tells us so much about these unfortunate characters. Every aspect of the film is put together is a way that just works. Yes, it's dark, and that is because of the characters and what all they go through, but there is some comedy sprinkled in there, dark comedy that is. But it's not awkward or weird, it works. 9/10 for I, Tonya.",9,3,4,7 March 2018
Dear John," Lackluster Sparks film adaptation
","Dear John is a movie adaptation of the popular Nicholas Sparks novel. It stars Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. I did not enjoy this movie, it's very flawed in many ways. I love a good love story, so don't think I rated it 1 because I hate romance stories, it's just because this romance film is very dull one. From the dull acting/characters to the ever slow moving plot and boring dialogue. There isn't much in the film that isn't dull and boring. The two lead actors look the part and you'd think they'd be good fits and work well, but I just couldn't see the chemistry between them, they never made me believe they were really in love and believable chemistry is CRUCIAL in a movie like this. And to be honest, even when Seyfried or Tatum were alone, I still didn't really buy or enjoy their performances. On to the writing. It's not good. It's just about that simple, the dialogue is very dull and uninteresting, I couldn't stand the script, with dull characters saying dull lines of dialogue, one gets bored and increasingly uninterested as the movie goes along. It really does nothing to keep your attention. It's very difficult for films like this because if the romance between the two leads doesn't work, then what more do you have?? That is what the movie is ALL about, it's the basis for it and it's why people are watching it. This film just really didn't work. 1/10.",1,1,2,31 March 2017
Crash," Not deserving of best picture but still a good movie
","I don't think this film is a 10/10 best picture academy award winning movie, I do think it's a good movie that deserves praise for what it does right, but I think best picture is giving it a little too much than it deserves. The cast does a wonderful job with their performances. Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Michael Pena, ludicrous, Ryan Philippe, Thandie Newton, and Matt Dillon all give very deep powerful performances. Acting is what this film really gets right, it's the best thing about the movie in my opinion. This is one of those movies where it takes many different kinds of characters from completely different backgrounds and intertwines their story lines and it asks the audience to ask some pretty serious questions about heavy issues that face our society and country. The script is well written and there are only a few parts in the middle of the movie where I felt like it dragged a bit. The acting really is what keeps the audience watching, the performances are just so well done and raw. There are some scenes that really do touch you in that special way and that's good because it's meant to stir feelings. There are a couple of African American male characters at the beginning and the one played by ludicrous is talking about racial profiling and discrimination and then they do something that is completely stupid and self destructive and truthfully embarrassing for the African American community. So that kinda ticked me off, and then you have a white rich couple who lets just say aren't the nicest people ever, even though you do come to sympathize with the woman (Sandra Bullock). And you have other characters that face Islamaphobia, racial stereotyping, and family issues. The movie for the most part does a good job with dealing with these tough issues. I wanted the film to be a little more shaking and remarkable than it was. It was shaking in a lot of ways, but I personally just don't feel like this one was best picture material. Maybe a nominee, but not a winner. 7/10.",7,1,1,24 April 2017
Scary Movie 2," A jumbled mess with few laughs
","Scary movie 2 is of course the sequel to the movie I wish I could forgot, Scary Movie (2000). This sequel is basically just more of the same, but maybe with a couple more laughs than the first film. The acting is alright I suppose, for this type of movie it is. Many of the jokes just fall flat and fail, but there are a couple that squeeze bye and actually did make me laugh. There are a couple of scenes where the gross out 'humor' was just too over the top for my taste. Tim Curry is in this movie, and I didn't really hate his character, but I certainly didn't love his character either, I didn't really care whether he was in it or not. If you liked first scary movie then you will probably like this one. But I just didn't care for it, the jokes were lame and dull, nothing to brag about. Yeah I guess that's about it there's not much more to say, this is a dull movie with too much gross out humor that really I would just like to forget about, basically the same as the first film. So both movies receive the same rating from me, a 3/10.",3,3,6,22 December 2015
Alien," Pretty good but aliens is better
","Ridley Scott's Alien really is a good film, even though it's sequel Aliens (1986) is better. This movie focuses on Ellen Ripley and her crew as this bloodthirsty alien runs amuck onboard. The movie takes a little while to get itself going, I didn't really mind that when something interesting was going on, but there were a few parts in the beginning were I just wanted them to move it along. I don't mind taking a bit longer to get the film started just as long as you keep me fairly interested and entertained while you're building up to things. The acting is very impressive in the movie, of course Sigourney Weaver is spot on great like always. The other supporting actors are pretty good. The effects are very good for 1979! The special effects in this movie is MILES better and a lot more effective than in 1992's alien 3. The action scenes are filmed well, a couple of the killing scenes are similar to like a slasher/regular horror killing, but then others are incredibly original and creative. I think everyone who has heard of this movie knows what scene I'm speaking about. Yes, it involves a man's chest and an alien. That scene is oh so effective! Very well done shocking scene. Overall this is a good entertaining well acted choice for a watch, but just wait until you see aliens!! 7/10",7,1,1,9 April 2017
Horrible Bosses," Just alright, nothing all that special
","Horrible Bosses is a pretty mediocre revenge comedy film in my opinion. I will say though that the performances by all the bosses, including Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Colin Farrel were very well played. I really did enjoy Jennifer Aniston's performance in particular, she really nailed her performance as Julia, she was viscous, über sexual, and very raunchy, which was exactly what her character called for. Kevin Spacey was very good as Jason Bateman's jackass of a boss, I mean this guy was just blatantly evil, and Spacey pulled it off wonderfully. So yes, the performances were pretty good all around, although I was not that impressed at all by the lack luster dialogue and the sorta weak execution of the plot. The dialogue was just too derivative, unfunny, wayy overly sexualized, and just dumb at times. So in short, Horrible Bosses is a lack luster comedy film with some pretty good performances by some A list actors.",6,2,3,9 October 2015
The Polar Express," Magical Christmas movie
","The Polar Express really brings the holiday season magic to life. Just the visuals alone are fantastic enough to make anyone feel in the Christmas mood. I love the story, it's every child's ultimate dream on Christmas Eve. The writing is good enough, I will say that it's not quite as good as some better animated movies, but it does the job. The songs are very festive and enjoyable too, almost all being sung by children aboard the train. The characters are interesting and each one different and unique in their own way. And Tom Hanks was a great pick to voice the conductor, Santa, Dad, and the homeless man. If that isn't the most roles ever given to one before..... lol. I will say that some of the middle part of the film does tend to drag a bit, but overall it is a good well constructed movie surrounding the holiday season dreams of millions of children across the globe. If you have younger children in your family then I definitely suggest watching around Christmas time. It comes on television a good bit around then anyways. It's fun, magical, and visually breathtaking. 7/10 for The Polar Express.",7,1,1,13 April 2017
Nacho Libre," I don't understand why people thought this was funny.....
","Nacho Libre is a very stupid, unnecessary, gross mediocre comedy. Jack black was sickening and very unfunny as the lead, and most of the time was shirtless and sweaty, which was gross. His sidekick, whatever his name is, just yelled and screamed the whole time, which wasn't funny at all, just really annoying. In fact, if I had to describe this movie in 1 word, that's what it'd be, annoying! The slapstick was annoying, and every character was as well! The only character I liked, was the love interest for jack blacks character, she wasn't annoying, and it's amazing, I never laughed once, not once! I just rolled my eyes a whole lot instead. Sorry Jack, just didn't impress me at ALL! 2/10 for Nacho Libre",2,0,0,4 May 2015
Closer," Story of 4 people hurting each other......
","Closer (2004) is a movie about 4 people who all are romantically or sexually involved with one another at some point in the course of the movie. Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, and Jude Law all turn in fabulous performances here, Owen and Portman even earning academy award nominations for their portrayals. The movie has fitting dialogue for the subject matter it deals with, it gets highly sexually explicit at several points due to what's happening. The tense scenes that contain fighting and yelling between the characters because of the deception and betrayal are the ones that are the most well done in my opinion. The film offers up a very raw and realistic view of these people and I think that is good, because the film had to be graphic and real, in order to show the true feelings and torture these characters endure. There are a couple places where you feel exhausted from the goings on, because things are constantly changing, but it's supposed to be that way. 7/10 for Closer. Raw, well done film with great acting.",7,0,2,5 March 2017
Shutter Island," Excellent mystery/thriller DiCaprio film
","Shutter Island (2010) is one of my absolute favorite mystery thrillers. Leonardo DiCaprio is great in the lead role. And Michelle Williams is good too, you can hardly tell she's even acting, it all just seems so natural. Ben Kingsley plays his role very well. The script is well written and it keeps you very invested the entire way through. The visuals in the film also contribute to the eerie/creepy feeling the whole movie gives the audience. This feeling is what makes you want to keep watching, this is NOT a film that anyone will be checking the time during. The movie is kind of long but you never feel like it's slow or dragging, they make every minute count. When you put the awesome visuals, impeccable dialogue, and great masterful acting all together, it makes for a great film, course when has Martin Scorsese ever disappointed? His directing is very precise and very careful. If you like scary movies, I think you'll enjoy this one, as long as you like scary movies that give you a bit of a challenge, ones that are more then just cheap slashers. On the other hand, if you just want a piece of escapist entertainment, something simple like a Friday the 13th, then try something else. I 100% suggest this film! It's just so well made in every aspect and incredibly entertaining.",10,0,2,1 April 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Not nearly as good as the first......
","Ya know special effects will only take a movie so far...... That is what this film struggles with in my opinion. This sequel to captain America had entertaining action sequences, but whenever somebody wasn't getting shot or cars weren't flipping, the movie was pretty boring. I just didn't have a good rims with this film like i thought I was going to. I thought the movie kinda drug along in places, and I spent a good portion of the film being bored. I know this movie was pretty darn successful as far as critic and audience reviews go, but I just wasn't that impressed by it. Also, the script and dialogue really was not that great at all, pretty dull If you ask me. I will say that Chris Evans did do a good job, as he did in the first film. I didn't really like Samuel L. Jackson in this movie, I didn't think his performance was up to par. Scarlett Johanson did well with her source material. Overall I think a 4/10 is fair.",4,1,7,26 November 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Wow! That was a great film!
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) really is a fantastic film, definitely deserved its Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards. They just got everything right with this one! A film of this type is very difficult to make. The main reason it's so tough, is because yes it's pretty dark due to the subject matter, but it also has some comedy sprinkled in occasionally. You have to make sure that the comedy sprinkled in does not make the subject out to be a joke, or that it doesn't diminish it in any way. Luckily, this one was done in a very smart fashion. When there is comedy, it is very funny, but when it's time to be serious and focus on the darker aspects, no on is laughing. That's how you pull off a film like this successfully. The plot surrounds Mildred, played by Frances McDormand. She rents three billboards just outside of Ebbing, where she lives. Those billboards have messages on them that go after the local police department, she is doing this because her daughter was raped and murdered and she doesn't think the cops are doing anything about it. After she does this, there is a lot of backlash and there are consequences that people suffer. I won't give away any spoilers, but let's just say that you won't be taking your eyes off the screen. Part of the reason for that is because of the cast this film boasts. McDormand gives a fabulous performance here, I mean I was blown away by her raw talent that was displayed here. So glad she took home the Oscar for this powerhouse performance. Woody Harrelson is good here too, his character isn't quite as big as McDormand and Sam Rockwell's, but he still did a good job. Sam Rockwell is a very talented actor and he proved that talent here with his portrayal of the very complicated, messy character that he plays. I loved every cast member and what they brought to the film. The writing is witty, clever, and above all, intelligent. I 100% recommend this film.",10,11,21,5 March 2018
American Sniper," Extremely moving war movie
","American Sniper tells the true story of SEAL Chris Kyle. Clint Eastwood really does a great job of truthfully telling and displaying the horrors of war and how it truly does affect the soldiers after they come back home from war. Bradley Cooper was amazing as the lead role, Chris Kyle. Sienna Miller was also very spot on with her performance as Chris's wife back home. The visuals and the war violence were very real, and really showed you how the were in Iraq really was for the soldiers, and how truly disturbing it was, not only for the soldiers, but also for their families. I was very entertained and satisfied with this film. It should've won Best Picture in my opinion, but maybe I should see Birdman before I say that. This film really left me speechless and I was truly moved and touched by not only the actors performances, but also how they portrayed the war in Iraq!",8,20,35,24 May 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl aka Queen of Hollywood does it once again!
","The devil wears Prada (2006) showcases so much talent! Talent from the actors, talent from the writers responsible for the script, and talent from virtually everyone involved in this film. Meryl Streep is absolutely fabulous as Miranda Priestly. Miranda kind of reminds me of Sadie Shelton (Bette Midler) from big business. Streep plays her with deeper meaning though, really gets into the character and there are scenes that give us the opportunity to see into Miranda and understand her as a person versus only seeing her as a tough as nails dragon lady. There is one in particular where she has absolutely no makeup and delivers a wonderfully written and very well executed monologue. It's great to see both the funny and dramatic aspects of this starring character. Anne Hathaway also stars as a young journalist living with her very sweet chef boyfriend. She comes to work alongside Emily blunt as one of Miranda's assistants. She is good in the film and I loved seeing her evolution as a character, she goes on a journey that tells her what's really important in her life. And just like Miranda, Anne's character has her comedic side also. Emily blunt is here and she's hilarious as Miranda's #1 assistant. And let me just say that the coat throwing on the desk part of the movie becomes important later in the movie so pay attention to that. The writing is both funny and touching at the same time and it's all tied together beautifully at the end. 9/10 for the devil wears Prada! A great choice for young teens and up.",9,2,3,25 April 2017
Forrest Gump," Not as great as everyone says but still pretty good
","Forrest Gump is a movie just about everyone knows about and have at least heard of if they haven't seen it. I will start out by saying that Tom Hanks really did do a great job at playing the lead role of Forrest Gump, he definitely deserved that Academy Award win, he is skilled and very committed. I also thought that Robin Wright was good in her role as Jenny, the childhood friend turned love of his life. They actually didn't have a whole lot of interaction together, the times they were on screen together were good and flowed pretty well, but throughout most of the movie it's Forrest going through his life and experiencing a lot of different things without Jenny. As he grows on his journey he always thinks about Jenny and we see her and what she's doing in life, but most of their time together is towards the end, with the exception of some brief time spent together in the middle of the movie. Sally field is also here and she was a great choice for Forrest's mother. Field works very well with Hanks and she has the perfect essence about her to play the southern mother with the advice that everyone quotes 'life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get'. The acting is of course great and the script is pretty good too. The reason I'm giving this film a 7 and not a 9 or even a 10 is because in my opinion there were parts of the film where I felt like it dragged a little, where I was slightly bored, overall I don't consider one of the greatest movies of all time like most do, but I do think it's a good movie. I especially loved the way it ended, very endearing and touching. 7/10 for Forrest Gump.",7,0,3,22 April 2017
21 Jump Street," Ehh... Just OK
","I just don't think this movie was nearly as funny as people let on. I mean it wasn't awful, but it definitely wasn't great. Yes it had it's funny parts, but they were far and few in- between!! They overloaded on cuss words and sex to try to make us laugh, and trust me there was nothing funny about it!! I also don't think all the jokes about drugs were all that funny. I mean a comedy is supposed to make u laugh, and I'm sorry but I just wasn't laughing a lot in this movie. I just don't get all the fuss over this movie. I liked Channing Tatum in it, but I HATE ice cube and Jonah Hill!!! Those 2 just weren't funny at all! I just think this film was very weak as far as comedy goes. Too much sex and profanity and not enough actual comedy and funniness.",4,1,1,8 March 2015
Bridget Jones's Diary," Not as great as everyone claims, but still amusing
","Bridget Jones's Diary is a somewhat amusing movie about an English woman who wants to change her life because she finds herself in her 30s and still single. I must say though that Renée Zellweger does a wonderful job and earns her Oscar nomination for portraying Bridget Jones. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fit their roles well also. The script is pretty average for a film like this, I don't know why but I wasn't really struck with the writing like a lot of people were, although I did like hearing Bridget's narration throughout the movie. And there were also some pretty genuinely funny moments. Now with all that said, that still doesn't mean that this romantic comedy is the best of its kind, in my opinion it's not. There were just some scenes that I thought lagged on too long and other parts that were dull. I do think that there are better romantic comedies to choose from out there, but it is worth just one watch just to see Renée Zellweger, because she really shines, if only the rest of the movie would've kept up with her. 6/10.",6,1,1,6 March 2017
Fargo," Frances McDormand shines!
","Fargo (1996) is a Cohen Brothers film, starring Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. I watched this film because of McDormand mainly, she's just such a great actress and I knew anything with her in a starring role would surely be great. And I was 100% right, Francs McDormand does not disappoint one bit as the lead, Margie, who's a Minnesota police officer. She is investigating a case of three homicides, and it turns out to be attached to something much bigger. William H. Macy plays a man who is trying to come into some money, he hires two men to kidnap his wife and arranges for his very wealthy father in law to pay the ransom. The performances in this film are top notch, Macy and McDormand give it their all. The writing is great too, the dialogue for each character suits them perfectly. It's so great to see a film with both great acting and smart writing. The ending is especially well done. The Cohen Brothers hardly ever make a bad film, and this one is just of the examples of that being true. Fargo gets a 9/10. Definitely on my must watch list.",9,1,1,19 April 2018
Notting Hill," Just alright
","Everyone I've talked to seems to absolutely adore this Julia Roberts-Hugh Grant romantic comedy. I don't really know why, I mean yes it has a few funny parts and no it's not terrible, but I don't really see anything that makes it stand out from the plethora of other romantic comedies. With romantic comedies, I don't usually require originality because I know you can't be too original with those films, but this one just wasn't interesting or entertaining enough to me. The acting isn't bad, in fact Roberts and Grant are pretty good in the movie, it's just other factors in the film that I wasn't so crazy about. The script is alright, to me there was nothing in the script that jumped out at me and really grabbed me, it was just okay, but the writing didn't inspire me to come back and watch this movie over again. Yes some of the humor was done well and there were several times where I laughed, unfortunately that alone was not enough to save the movie and make me recommend seeing it. I'll finish up by saying this. It's not a bad movie, you won't reach the end and say wow that was bad, but if you're like me then you'll come to the end and feel like you could've watched a better movie of that genre and been more satisfied. Notting Hill is just okay when it's all said and done. 6/10.",6,0,0,26 April 2017
The Aviator," Wonderfully made film based on Howard Hughes
","The Aviator really is a fantastic film. The acting is so wonderfully done! I adored Cate Blanchett gives an impeccable portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. I mean everything from the voice and the behavior to her emotions. Very well deserved academy award victory! And of course Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job with his representation of the famed Aviator Howard Hughes. He is charming when the film calls for it, acts like a real old timey gentlemen, but then he can turn into a totally unhinged crazy person. And DiCaprio handles both kinds of demeanors very well. The script is very intelligently written and it gives such lengthy character development for both Hughes and Hepburn. I just adored the scenes that involved monologues by either Hughes or Hepburn, or scenes where it's them conversing back and forth. The acting is so involved and as I've mentioned, the script provides such deep character detail that when you combine those two things, it makes for an absolutely magical moment. And there are plenty of those kind of moments. The film handles the final stage in Hughes's life well, him going crazy, locking himself naked in a theater room. Long nails, long hair, completely naked, it would be an understatement to say he went 'mad' towards the end of his life, and Leonardo plays this so well! Very realistic and it all flows naturally, doesn't seem forced in the slightest. Overall a fantastic film based on real people. 10/10!",10,2,2,7 April 2017
American Pie," Actually turned out to be deeper than gross out humor
","I will say this for American Pie, it's not full out of completely gross out humor like Van Wilder (2002). It's got a couple of scenes based on crude humor, but I was glad to see that for the most part, the movie steered clear of over the top disgusting humor. The characters are good hearted boys that think they just want sex, and for a couple of the characters that turns out to be true, but for a couple other of them, it turns out that just 'getting laid' isn't the most important thing. I liked that the characters actually ended up to have a deeper want and that they actually end up having better connections with girls that yes may involve sex, but that's not all that it's based upon. Now this movie isn't all love and good hearted stuff, it's got plenty and I do mean plenty of raunchy/dirty humor. Humor that involves male and female masturbation in different ways, premature ejaculation, and very descriptive talk of all kinds of sexual activities. Just FYI in case any of that offends you. There is some truly funny material in the film, I laughed at several scenes in the movie. I didn't think it was laugh out loud hilarious, but some parts were funny. The parts I wasn't laughing at, I was feeling for the characters. I loved the acting from all the cast members. Tara Reid was really good as Vicky. Jason Biggs was a perfect choice for Jim. Thomas Nicholas is great as Kevin. Chris Klein is very good as Oz. And the rest of the cast is good too, but Kevin, Vicky, Oz, and Jim are the biggest characters here. I loved how Oz and Kevin were so adorable and were actually good hearted guys. I really like American Pie because not only is it funny but it's also good hearted and filled with good characters. 8/10.",8,7,7,2 August 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Best one of the series
","They always say that the first in a film series is the best, I haven't always found that to be true, but in this case it is. This first lord of the rings movie truly is great and it is every bit as outstanding as when it was first released in 2001. The movie really has everything in the world going for it. It is well written, it has a great talented cast playing well developed characters, the effects and visuals are impeccable, and it's fun and entertaining as hell. I have not read the enormously famous and very popular books, but to be honest it's not necessary to read the first book in order to appreciate this film. I didn't read it and I still loved it. The plot is very interesting and will definitely keep you invested in the story the whole way through. The actors do a wonderful job at making you care about their characters. Ian McKellen gives the best performance by far out of anyone. There couldn't have been a better casting choice for Gandolph, he played him perfectly, my attention was undivided when he came on screen. The other actors do an overall good job, they play the roles well, it's just that McKellen was so captivating and commanded the screen. The action scenes are great fun and the visuals are mesmerizing to look at. The movie is both intelligent and fun, the greatest movies combine both of those things. 9/10 for lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring. See it if you haven't already!",9,1,1,11 September 2017
Grease," Grease is THE word!!! It sooo is!
","Omg this is my favorite musical of all time!! There is nothing to hate in this movie!! The songs are great! The actors do a fine job. The dancing in so energetic and fun. I haven't found another musical that I had nearly as much fun in other than this! You just have so much fun while watching this movie! It makes you wanna get up and dance your butt off!! It's just a classic, it never gets old. I can watch it over and over and it never gets old!! I luv that type of movie!! This movie is the perfect one to watch during summertime, or at least it me it is, and it should be to everyone else!! If you haven't seen this movie, then my lord bless your heart!! Go on Netflix NOW and watch it, and if u hate it, well then I'll pray for you!!",8,0,1,8 March 2015
28 Weeks Later," fun, exciting action-horror movie
","I have not yet seen the first film, 28 days later, so I can't speak to that and how this sequel follows up to it. I can only speak as to how this film is and whether it was effective or not. Personally, I do think it's an effective film. It is meant to be fun, entertaining, and full of action. It is a popcorn flick for sure. With all that being said, the filmmakers did a pretty good job with it. The effects and visuals work well for the most part. The actors did a good job, Byrne and Renner in particular. The action sequences are overall well done, maybe a bit too shaky in a couple parts, but that wasn't a huge issue. After seeing this film, I'm now inspired to see 28 days later. I'd suggest this one if you're looking for a fun action-horror film. But beware.... if zombies and some goriness makes you shy away from watching something, then this one ain't for you. 8/10 for 28 weeks later.",8,0,0,27 April 2018
The Village," Great film!!!
","Better than the 6th sense. I know people are going to disagree, but Idc, this film is a true masterpiece by M. Night Shamalyn. Bruce Dallas Howard kills it in the role, and so does Adrien Brody, and Joaquin Phoenix. I luv the twist ending, I didn't see it coming at all, I adore twist endings, so that was pleasing to see! I'm not going to reveal the surprise ending, you'll just have to tune in for yourself!! Sigourney weaver was also very appealing in the role, it's always pleasing to see her in ANYTHING, she's one of my favorites! I felt that the costumes and sets were great also! The film kept an eerie tone and mood to it all the way through till the end, which was integral to the movie itself, because of the subject matter it deals with.",8,1,2,22 March 2015
Trouble with the Curve," Pretty good fluff entertainment
","Trouble with the Curve (2012) is one of those fluffy family drama films, it fits pretty much every stereotype. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, but just know that going in. If you know this and you want to see a film like that, then you'll most likely enjoy it and have a good time. But if you're expecting another fantastic Clint Eastwood film that'll win more Academy Awards, then this is not that. I'll talk about what I thought worked first. The cast did a great job and I thought they all had impressive chemistry. Amy Adams played the role of Mickey, Gus's daughter well and I really believe she was the best possible choice for the character. Clint Eastwood of course gives a great performance as Gus, the lead character. Eastwood and Adams pull off the father/daughter dynamic well and Timberlake and Adams also pull off the romantic chemistry. The romantic plot between them is very well placed in the film and it's good to see. The main thing I didn't care for about this film was the feeling of average that I got after it was over. I walked away feeling that it was between alright and pretty good, a 7/10, and that's not awful of course, but I was hoping for better. This is a film I only recommend if you know what you're going into and you don't expect to get more than that.",7,0,1,31 March 2018
Split," Very entertaining, well made triller
","Split (2016) is M Night Shamylan's newest film. I was a big fan of his last work, The Visit. That movie really was Shamylan's way of proving to people that he still has what it takes. This movie continues to prove that he still has it, that he's capable of making a great psychological thriller. This movie surrounds James Macavoy's character Henry, well Henry and his 23 identities. Henry suffers from dissociative identity disorder (DID). He is a mental patient who goes to see Dr. Karen Fletcher, played by Betty Buckley. She is increasingly concerned because of urgent emails she keeps receiving from Henry, different identities take Henry over and email her about the urgent situation that's going on. A very dangerous one of Henry's 23 different identities had taken over him and abducted three innocent teenage girls. I absolutely loved the acting performances in this movie. Macavoy is perfect as Henry, and he plays the different identities wonderfully. I also really liked Buckley as Dr. Fletcher, her character is so well meaning and tries to her best to reach/help Henry. As she attempts to get to the bottom of what's happening, these three abducted girls try to find a way to escape. Things grow more and more creepy and freaky as the film progresses. I suggest this creepy intelligent film to any and all who enjoy this kind of thing. 8/10",8,1,3,1 December 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," An alright horror
","The Hills Have Eyes is an alright horror movie. It is pretty formulaic, but even if a film is somewhat formulaic, it can be entertaining, well this movie has it's moments, but unfortunately the moments come far and few in between. The acting is suitable but everything is kind of blah. The violence is too graphic for my taste and the characters are pretty boring. Well, bobby and Doug are kinda interesting, but the rest of them just don't have enough depth. The suspense is there, although there are other scary films that have much better suspenseful scenes. If you're a horror fan, you might find some joy in this, but it's just overall not worth it if you ask me. 6/10 for The Hills Have Eyes.",6,1,2,7 January 2017
Cold Mountain," Film that addresses romance, friendship and the effects of war
","Cold mountain is a film that addresses big issues like romance, friendship and the harsh effects of war. It shows these things in a very open and raw way. The film's best thing that it has going for it is the excellent performances by the A list cast. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and she turns in a great performance as Ada. Jude Law also stars as Ada's love interest, even though he rarely shares the screen with Kidman, the majority of the film focuses on them living apart longing to see one another again. And that journey to return to each other is really what makes the romance great here. We also have Renee Zellweger. This is the performance that earned her an academy award. Zellweger is wonderful here, she plays a very blunt, country girl that helps out Ada with the farm. The movie's best acted moments are by Zellweger. She truly makes the viewer feel the raw emotion in her performance. The script is very well written. I love how it isn't melodramatic but it still manages to create emotion. Seeing these characters and the tragic events they go through will make you care deeply for them. But it isn't just that they go through junk, it's how they survive and the connections they have in one another. That's really what Cold Mountain is all about. It's about connections with people and learning how to keep going. 8/10. I recommend this one!",8,2,2,1 August 2017
American Psycho," A delve into madness
","American Psycho (2000) really is all about Christian Bale's descent into complete madness. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a very handsome 27 year old business man who has an extremely dark, sadistic side to him that nobody knows about. The plot revolves around Bateman and this dark side of himself, and what the horrible consequences are. One thing is for damn sure, this is not a flowery happy film, it's a dark film that isn't for everyone. It's a crime film but it also has some satire to it as well. There are other well known actors involved too. Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, and Josh Lucas. Lucas and Theroux play Batemans jackass colleagues. They aren't deep characters, they're just kind of the stereotypical chauvinistic privileged jerks. The other characters in the movie aren't really focused on though, this is Bale's movie, it's all about him. I will say that Bale's performance is very good, it's skillful and I don't think anyone could have played it like he did. I think this is a good film, not an excellent one. I didn't really care the satirical aspect of the movie, didn't appeal to me. The main thing I enjoyed was Bale's acting. I suggest it if it's your kind of movie, but it's not highly suggested. I wouldn't put it on a must see list, but it is a good film overall. 7/10.",7,1,1,3 September 2017
Knowing," Not as bad as the reviews say
","Knowing is one of Nicholas Cage's lesser films, that's true, but it's nearly as bad as the majority of the critics reviews. Knowing is a science fiction film starring Nicolas Cage and Rose Byrne. The plot surrounds children who are able to tell when the worlds most horrific disasters and atrocities happened. Figuring out how these kids know these things and what the numbers mean is really what the entire movie is about. The performances are pretty good from the two leads. Byrne and Cage both turn in believable performances. I think that the script was average, the writers did their job, it's nothing spectacular but it suffices. The idea of the movie was very interesting and it's executed well for the most part. There are some parts of the movie that do feel kind of lackluster but they pale in comparison to the ending and how interesting it turns out to be. Some people said they thought the ending was too weird and random but I think it was unexpected and cool. And I think the way in which it ended gave the film a meaning. Overall yes I would recommend Knowing, it's not one I'd go to automatically when recommending films to people but I would say it's a fairly interesting watch. 7/10.",7,4,5,30 July 2017
The Shining," Pretty good, not to the caliber of top 250 though
","I liked the shining, I just didn't agree that it was a perfect 10/10 horror film. Yes, Jack Nicholson was wonderful in the leading role, he just seemed like a normal father and husband. Shelley Duvall is good too, why she was nominated for a Razzie I will never know. She engaged very well with Nicholson and handled the intense scenes realistically. The writing works pretty well, especially the dialogue between Duvall and Nicholson, when his character begins to go mad and get violent, that's when the best acting and writing is. The filming and scenery is great, I loved the opening shots, and the eerie score makes it one hundred percent better. The music is great here, it has a very creepy/eerie feeling to it. Little Danny is great too, especially for the age he was when this was made. Kubrick is a masterful director and he does so well with this movie, he knows how to film it in just the right way to ensure a scary effect. The bathtub scene is one of the creepiest and best scene in the whole movie. The full frontal nudity was necessary for the scene, hardly ever is full frontal nudity in a movie, but it is for this one, when she turns into an old creepy deformed woman it has the perfect effect! And of course the CLASSIC here's Johnny scene is wonderfully done. From jacks mad as hell behavior to Shelley's wonderful scared out of her wits reaction. All in all an interesting film that's definitely worth a watch. A very thought provoking ending too, leaves the viewer with questions. Have to watch to find out what i mean ;). Yes, some of the scenes have a slight cheesiness to them, but that's my only complaint. 7/10.",7,1,4,29 March 2017
American Beauty," Very powerful film
","American beauty is a film that's not for everyone, some will not get it or just think it makes no sense. But I found it to be a very well made movie that has a good bit to say. First of all, Kevin spacey gives a very powerful yet seemingly effortless performance. And Annette Benning, oh wow how the he'll did she not pick up the Oscar along with Kevin. Benning seems like a sort of Stepford wife kind of character at first, but you soon find out that she is hiding a whole lot underneath. I love the scene where Carolyn is trying desperately to sell a house and she runs out of luck at the end of the day and starts crying then slapping herself repeatedly saying 'you baby!' and 'weak!'. That in my opinion is a crucial scene when it comes to Carolyn's character development and giving the audience a deep look inside of her. I was thoroughly impressed with thora Birch's performance too, haven't seen anything from her other than the underrated Disney classic hocus pocus. Chris Cooper is great as the horribly prejudice overly tough ex marine father of Wes Bentley, who also turns in a fine very mature performance. Cooper's is an incredibly sad example a closeted gay man who won't accept his own sexuality and in turn is extremely anti gay towards everyone and takes out his anger and frustration on his eighteen year old son. The movie does a wonderful job at telling the complex stories of each and every character and they all intertwine very well. I adored the cast, how the cast portrayed their characters and the clever writing. Well deserving of best picture!",10,1,2,22 March 2017
We're the Millers," A very funny, sweet movie.
","We're the millers is a funny film with sweet warm hearted moments. It also features great performances by all the actors, including Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudeikus, Emma Stone, and Will Poulter. The movie has a very funny script with great dialogue between all the characters. The chemistry with the cast works well too, awesome casting choices here! This movie was a good surprise, I didn't think it was going to be that great going into it, but it was in my opinion. It's definitely not for the entire family obviously, a lot of frequent profanity, and sexual humor, but it does work well with the script and plot. The content isn't too crude or crass, it works well with the movie. Jennifer Aniston really shined in this movie, she gave the most credible and notable performance in my opinion. And the couple that the millers come into contact with had the best and funniest moments in the film! Hilarious scenes with them! 8/10 for we're the millers!",8,0,1,15 November 2015
Van Helsing," Very fun!
","Van Helsing (2004) is fun and pretty well made in different aspects. It has good acting throughout by all the actors, especially by Beckinsale and Jackman. Kate Beckinsale really is a great choice for the role she fulfills, she has the correct physical look/appearance, and she fits in all the other ways as well, good cast call. Hugh Jackman is obviously playing the main character here, Van helsing. Hugh also gives a fine performance, and he also physically fits the role, he's very stoic at times but then heartfelt at times when he needs to be, and he's strong/muscular, which of course is necessary with all the action scenes and maneuvers he must perform. Speaking of action scenes, the special effects and the actual fighting in this movie is all very well done, and I don't mean to say that it's the best thing in any action movie you'll see, but it suffices. I also really like the way they did Dracula's wives, seductive and menacing at the same time, which of course is the way Dracula's wives are supposed to be. I thought the plot was entertaining and I thought it was executed well. So all in all Van Helsing receives a seven out of 10 as far as quality goes.",7,2,3,18 November 2016
Divergent," Entertaining
","Divergent is an entertaining movie to sit and enjoy, that's for damn sure, it was actually better than what my expectations preceded. Shailene Woodley shines in her staring role as Beatrice, and Theo James is so perfect for his co staring role as Four. My absolute favorite actor here though is hands down Kate Winslet, she is so focused, determined, and unapologetically devoted to her maniacal plot, and it's obvious that she gave it her all the entire way through. The costume design is wonderfully constructed, especially for the Elite characters like Winslet. And the set direction is awesome to look at, very well put together. The action sequences are pretty standard PG-13 action movie material, not meaning that in a bad way, just saying you know what you're getting when it comes to that specific issue. The plot is very intriguing and it will for sure keep you interested and wanting more. Ashley Judd is great to see on screen here as well, a very noble addition to the well rounded cast, she is caring, adventurous and warm hearted in her motherly role to Beatrice. I really loved the dialogue back and forth between the characters too, very intelligent and witty. I cannot wait to sit and watch Insurgent, and then Allegiant, crossing my fingers in hopes they will prove themselves worthy, like this first installment did. An 8/10 for Divergent!",8,5,7,21 April 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Interesting, intriguing film
","The girl with the dragon tattoo (2011), based off a novel, and a Swedish film, is a very dark interesting film. It's full of disturbing twisted people and the whole plot centers around a family that did horrible things in the past. These bad/disturbing things are rehashed when a journalist (Daniel Craig) is hired by the family patriarch (Christopher Plummer) to solve a murder of a 17 year old female relative that occurred 40 years ago. Daniel Craig enlists the help of a state ward (Rooney Mara) to assist him in researching exactly what happened to this teenage girl. The plot/trailer combined with the stellar reviews is what attracted me to this film, and I'm glad I was attracted to it. First of all, the performances by Mara, Craig, Penn, and Plummer are all incredible and on point. Mara's performance should be especially recognized, gosh did she ever deserve that academy award nomination. Her character is so raw and rough and complicated, and she plays it wonderfully throughout. I 100% recommend this movie to all mature audiences. Notice I say MATURE audiences, the rape scene is graphic and is sure to disturb, keep that in mind if you can't take that stuff, and there are several other graphic sexual scenes with extensive nudity. Just keep in mind that this is meant to be a very rough dark film, due to the subject matter. 8/10 for the girl with the dragon tattoo.",8,0,1,10 March 2017
Dreamgirls," Very entertaining musical with awesome singing
","This screen adaptation of the classic Broadway musical is a very well made one. The cast is great, they all so such a fine job with their performances. Jennifer Hudson gives the best performance out of all in my opinion. Hudson just has an incredible singing voice and she shows off her acting chops along with her singing ability in this film. Eddie Murphy is a supporting actor here, he's alright, I personally don't think his performance here was deserving of an academy award nomination, but it's not necessarily a bad performance. Jamie Foxx plays Beyoncé Knowles's husband who is involved in the music industry and helped get the girls started. He gave a good performance, if you ask me I think he should have gotten an academy award nomination instead of Murphy. I really enjoyed Beyoncé Knowles and her performance, of course her singing is good, everyone knows she won't let you down on that front. I may be slightly biased since I'm a big Beyoncé fan, but she really is good here. The script allows for deep character development and good story lines for every character. And of course fantastic musical performances. I'm telling you that Jennifer Hudson has a set of unbelievable pipes! 8/10 for Dreamgirls.",8,0,1,9 April 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," One of the best, if not THE best action movies I've ever seen!
","OK, so I loved mission impossible: ghost protocol, I told myself they cannot do better than that, that's just the best it gets, it's impossible to do any better! Well, something you learn from these movies is NOTHING is impossible! Oh my goodness this film was incredible! Great action sequences! Impeccable performances by every single actor, including the newbie Alec Baldwin! The plot was so well put together, along with the script and dialogue between characters. The camera shots and even the scenery was well done also. The mission impossible movies just get it right! I don't know what it is, they just do!! Of course Tom Cruise was just amazing as Tom always is in every movie! My expectations were SURPASSED here, the best MI movie ever!! I also especially enjoyed the main actresses role and performance in the film. 10/10.",10,0,5,30 August 2015
She's the Man," Channing Tatum ;)
","She's the man is a pretty good teenage flick. This came out back before Amanda Bynes was insane. Channing Tatum and Amanda Bynes really do have great chemistry. And the film is mildly funny not hilarious. Of course seeing Channing Tatum in his soccer uniform is always nice! So that's a plus for the ladies and the gay guys out there. The lines of dialogue in this movie are just OK, nothing that's going to knock your socks off. Kind of the same thing with the acting, it's all right, but it's not awful and it's not superb. I think the teenagers will find this enjoyable I'm not so sure if adults will enjoy it though it's really for a teenage audience. There is some sweet romance and friendship. Overall shes the man is not really a gem, but it is sort of enjoyable. 6/10 for she's the man. But like I said, if you enjoy seeing chaining Tatum shirtless and in sports uniforms, you will love it!",6,0,0,27 November 2015
Jarhead," Empty and obnoxious
","I sincerely hope marines don't act like this in real life. I already had no interest in joining the military and this movie doesn't wanna make me change my mind lol. It stars Jake Gylanhaal, Jamie Foxx, Lucas Black, and Peter Sarsgaard. These men are good actors and I'm surprised they chose to do this bland empty film. The script doesn't provide any kind of meat or interesting dialogue to enjoy. It's just obnoxious typical 'male banter', and I hate that lol, can't the writers be a little more creative?? It's not the constant cursing I mind, that doesn't bother me in the least, it's the boring often times offensive comments made by these degenerate soldiers. They are crotch grabbing, sex obsessed, derogatory comment slinging annoying men. I don't mind sex talk between characters, but this movie was so anti-gay in its language and the men talked about women in a very objective way. And when they aren't behaving like complete idiots, they are trigger happy and talking about wanting to kill, it seems they actually want war and killing, which is disturbing. I respect military men and women and thank them for what they endure to serve our nation but I sincerely hope they don't behave like this. They're like baboons lol. 1/10 for Jarhead. Doesn't keep your attention at all, just a bland and empty film.",1,4,6,30 April 2017
Dark City," Unconventional sci fi film
","Dark City is definitely a one of a kind movie. There's no other in the science fiction genre that's similar to it. It stands alone. Most of the time I really enjoy films that are unique and stand out, and this one fits into that most category. Typically I'm not huge on the science fiction genre, but I think even if you don't usually care for that type of film, you'll still like this one. One of the reasons it can transcend a strict science fiction audience is because of its intelligence. The film doesn't reveal a whole lot until the very end, which is very clever, keeps the viewer guessing the whole way through. The cast is very good. I think each and every cast member was picked well and represents their role well. The plot is a lot to explain, and the movie gets more complicated as it goes along, so I'll just say that the plot is full of rich twists and turns. I can almost 100% guarantee that you will not be bored with this film, too much is going on for that to happen. The special effects were good for 1998, they are kind of dated by today's standards, but they still work, the buildings in the city are probably the most interesting thing as far as visual effects go. Overall, I do recommend this very interesting film. 8/10.",8,18,21,12 September 2017
Bad Teacher," One of the better comedies today. Impressed!
","Bad teacher is a hilarious modern comedy about a teacher who does nothing, and is looking to raise money for a fake boob job. Lynn in this movie was the best part!! She was friggin hilarious. Her and Cameron together was priceless! Two very talented comedic actresses. Justin Timberlake also did a pretty good job with his role. Jason Segal's character didn't really become important until a little later into the movie, but I thought he did a good job with his material. And lastly, mrs. Squirrel, that actress did a GREAT job with her character, I really enjoyed her. This movie does have it's flaws, but I feel like most off them are overshadowed by the movies overall energy and fun nature. So if you haven't already check out bad teacher, it's lots of fun!",8,5,8,10 March 2015
Aliens," Get away from her you b***h!
","Absolutely adored this film! Aliens is far better than the original 1979 Alien movie. Seriously, Sigourney weaver was the ultimate bad a** here! She honestly couldn't have deserved that academy award nomination more. This movie will forever be a classic, James Cameron really did it with this movie, he blew me away will everything. From the top notch acting to the writing and the special effects, it's all nothing but the best. The effects were awesome even by today's standards, they still hold up and that's saying something considering this was released in 1986. The writing here is awesome, the writer really deserves many awards for this. Bill Paxton is the one actor I didn't really care for, but he wasn't all bad, he was just annoying in the beginning. The rest of the crew, including Hicks and the others were good characters that I genuinely cared about throughout. The action here is great too, very exciting and well done as far as visuals go. This movie is so incredible in every way! It's a lot of fun, but it's not just about fun, it's deeper than that, and it's very intelligently created. Also, the chemistry between the characters is spot on and so natural seeming. And of course, the infamous line! 'Get away from her you b***h!' That line will always be one of the most famous lines in cinema history. Aliens is now one of my all time favorite films! 10/10!",10,1,3,17 July 2016
Now You See Me," A very intelligent caper film
","This film is an extremely intriguing mind twisting thrill ride. The plot and the twists that entangle it are truly amazing! The special effects are well done and add to the overall movie. The actors, including Morgan freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Michael Caine all do a very good job with their lines and scenes. I thought Morgan Freeman did the best job of the entire cast personally. This movie had very sneaky clever plot twists, as you would expect from Now You See Me. It's all a big illusion, and it's an illusion you won't want to miss. This movie is intelligent and smart as well. The action sequences are great fun too! I cannot wait for the sequel in the summer of 2016! 7/10.",7,0,2,23 November 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Very powerful superhero film
","Captain America: Civil America is such a strong powerful marvel superhero movie! The acting is great from the entire cast, including Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Sebastian Stan. I loved this film also for the extended superbly done action sequences. The action/violence is done just right for a marvel movie. The writing is very well done too, it's got it's comedic moments that are truly funny and delivered well by the actors. The stunts are great and the special effects/visuals are very well put together. I liked the younger new teenage Spider-Man here, i thought he did well with his role. You will not be bored for one second all throughout this film, never a dull moment. That is the duty of a hero movie after all, is to entertain with action, and to create good characters with depth. Civil War did all of those things very well, it wasn't perfection, but it came pretty damn close. The different characters come together so well, and their chemistry is spot on. I was genuinely happy with this entry in the marvel hero franchise, the director made all the right decisions. I give Captain America a 9 out of 10.",9,7,16,13 May 2016
Saw III," Almost vomited during one scene....
","The third installment in the grisly nasty Saw franchise is much gorier and more stomach turning the original Saw movie, haven't seen the second one, and I don't think I will. This makes the fourth Saw movie I've seen and I honestly don't know why I have watched that many, first one wasn't too bad on the nastiness, but this one was unbelievably over the top. When there are dead pigs being shredded up and their remains and innards poured into a hole where a man is drowning in it...... Seriously? In case it's still a mystery, that's the scene I nearly vomited during. There really isn't anything that's at all good or redeeming about the film, except the acting. The acting is actually not bad. But that one good thing is very quickly overshadowed by the poor writing, annoyingly over the top gross out gore and torture, and the bad ending. There are sooo many other horror/suspense/thriller movies out there that are much better quality wise and won't make you horribly sick while watching. Pick one of those. And please, for the love of god, don't let kids or young teens see this...... 3/10.",3,0,0,4 March 2017
Pearl Harbor," Don't understand the bad reviews
","I thought this movie was a big success. I don't agree or understand with a lot of the reviews saying that it was poorly made or cheesy. I thought the film was very entertaining and also very accurate to the horrible occurrence in history. This is basically World War II titanic version. Titanic and Pearl Harbor do have a good bit in common. Based of of course a tragic true event in history, has a fictional romance between the two main characters, and they're both long!! But I love long movies so it's all good. I liked the romantic storyline Beckinsale had between her and Affleck and eventually Hartnett too. I thought all three of the main actors nailed their roles, especially Josh Hartnett, I very much liked him in this film, came a long way from Halloween H20 (another great film by the way). I also liked Alec Baldwin here too, good fit for him. The movie does a good job with handling both the romantic story lines and the with telling the true events of December 7th, 1941. The visuals were great! From the scenery to the very true to the period sets to the incredible effects during the actual attack scenes. Very well deserved academy award win there. And deserved nominations too, technically the movie looked wonderful. And I enjoyed the dialogue, story lines, and the cast. Don't listen to the critics on this one, give it a try. I loved how they handled the ending too, very well done. 8/10.",8,3,4,29 March 2017
Jackie," Wonderfully constructed
","Jackie (2016) tells the story of Jacquelyn Kennedy and how she copes with the tragic loss of her husband, President John F Kennedy. Natalie Portman plays Jacquelyn, and she does a wonderful job portraying this historical woman and showing her trying her best to cope with the pain and grief of her husbands assassination. Peter Sarsagard plays bobby, JFK's brother, I think he did a good job at portraying him as accurately as possible. Suffice to say that the acting is wonderful all around by every single member of the cast in this film. I loved the writing too, the dialogue all throughout, especially by Portman, is all so well written and well delivered by the actors. The script focuses completely on Jackie and those around her reacting and attempting to deal with the presidents sudden and shocking death. The movie actually does show JFK's shooting (WARNING, which is kind of graphic), but it needed to be graphic in order to be completely authentic. You don't have to be interested in American history or politics to enjoy this very well made film. Anyone and everyone can and will enjoy this great movie. I encourage all to view it at least once, it's definitely worth it! 9/10 for Jackie.",9,0,0,28 May 2017
Enchanted," Very entertaining Disney film
","Disney's Enchanted (2007) is a very entertaining well thought out movie for all ages. Amy Adams is a perfect pick to play the lead here, she's bubbly, endlessly cheerful, and fits the princess perfectly. Patrick Dempsey is great in his role as well, he plays the widowed successful divorce attorney father raising a young daughter. He is very distant and detached in the beginning of the movie but as the film progresses and as he falls for Amy Adams, he starts to break from that and become more warm and we get to learn a lot more about his character. The character depth in the movie is very well executed and is more satisfying than most run of the mill family oriented films. And then we get to Susan Sarandon as the evil queen, which in my opinion was the best casting decision in the whole movie. She is so effortlessly evil and deliciously wicked. The visual effects are masterful and very cool to see, it's obvious that a large amount of effort was given to special effects, which is a very necessary thing for a film like this. You get an overall good feeling while viewing this movie, and the well written good hearted characters and great actors to play them are largely due to that. The movie incorporates different classic Disney animated films in the monumental ending. Such as leaving behind a glass slipper (Cinderella), a fire breathing dragon (sleeping beauty), and others, which was neat. I suggest this film as good well done entertainment. 8/10.",8,2,2,16 March 2017
Inside Out," An instant classic!! My favorite Pixar film by far!
","Wow! Inside Out is outstanding in every way! It's so smart, of course kids will enjoy it, but adults will absolutely love it too! It also features hilarious moments, mostly involving Joy and Sadness, who were amazing on screen together! The concept was executed so well, all the aspects of the mind, how dreams are made, everything was so creative and never seen before. The voice actors are perfectly cast! Phyllis smith cast as sadness was spot on! And of course Amy pohler stole the spotlight as Joy. The movie at times was also very moving and heart felt, I found myself close to tears at one point. I thought Pixar really out did themselves! This is my favorite Pixar film of all time! I found myself having belly laughs through the whole thing, along with tears at other parts. Disgust and anger and fear were also very well made, and featured very funny moments as they try to function when joy and sadness are missing. This movie really just leaves you more than satisfied. I was actually sad when it was over, that's when you know a movie is truly fantastic! 10/10 there wasn't a single flaw in the perfect movie! :)",10,19,55,20 June 2015
Independence Day," My favorite special effects ever in a film!!
","This larger than life summer blockbuster spectacle is a fun, entertaining, and visually pleasing experience. This is honestly a film u must watch on the big screen!! The huge destruction scene with the lasers is one of my favorite scenes in Cinema! The effects are amazing, even by today's standards. I actually prefer those effects rather than today's. But not only effect make this film great, but also the actors are perfect in their roles. Very smart dialogue, and a sharp plot make it great too. I truly can see it was the highest grossing film of that year!! This film is really just a load of fun. I watched it over and over as a kid, and still today",8,1,2,17 March 2015
The Butterfly Effect," Roller coaster of a film
","The Butterfly Effect starring Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart is a twisted roller coaster of a movie. It is about Evan (Ashton Kutcher) and his ability to look at different entries in his childhood journals and go back in time to change something bad that happened in order to save someone in his life, it's almost always to save the love of his life Kayleigh (Amy Smart). The movie plays kind of like a dumbed down version of other smarter more sophisticated thrillers. I really do feel conflicted about the film. It has it's intriguing moments and it features good performances by the actors, especially Amy Smart. But on the other hand, there are times in the movie where you just roll your eyes because it's the usual teen/college aged crap you see in stereotypical youth targeted films. The college/sorority section of the film was the main part of the movie where I felt that way, the way the characters acted was dumb and almost laughable, and it was hard to buy, but then in other sections the material was solid and I bought the whole thing. That's why this film as a whole is a mixed bag, there's some pretty good things in it, but it never really reaches greatness, and it doesn't rise above character stereotypes that dumb down the movie. Another good thing I liked was how it ended, it was kind of touching and different. Overall I'd say a 6/10 is the fairest and most accurate rating for The Butterfly Effect.",6,0,1,4 June 2017
Alien vs. Predator," Don't understand all the hate, this was awesome!!
","Just finished watch AVP for the first time today, and I thought it was very entertaining. I loved the special effects, the storyline, the characters, and the way it ended! I really don't get all the poor reception this film received. This is just pure fun and a very entertaining action/horror film! The movie made you care about what happened to the characters, and made the leads very likable. It gave the aliens and the predators a backstory about where they came from, and how everything all started, which I really liked. I think the actors did a pretty good job of portraying their individual characters. The action was non stop and very intense, lots of slime and gore, and weapons being thrown left and right. You really couldn't ask for more from this exciting film. 8/10",8,2,2,10 April 2015
Mamma Mia!," Another brilliant musical, and with Meryl Streep!
","A great musical featuring Meryl Streep, what more could you possibly ask for out of a movie?!! All of the songs featured in Mamma Mia! are great, very catchy, and they make you want to jump up and dance along, and after all that IS a musicals job, to make you feel the music! And this one did exactly that, unlike say a piece of junk called Rocky Horror, but I've already reviewed that crap, so moving on. Meryl Streep carries this entire movie, I wasn't a big fan of Amanda Seyfried, i think the main poster should have Meryl on the front, because she's the star, not Amanda, she takes a BIG backseat to Meryl in this. Meryl just has so much charisma in her singing and dancing here! And i also loved Christina Baranski, favorite scene with her, 'does your mother know?' She has a lot of energy in this movie! I really think Amanda was a poor casting choice though, she seemed pretty dull in my opinion. But thankfully Meryl and others stole most of the screen time! The set was beautiful, with the Greek islands, loved that! The ending was clever, I sorta expected it, but kinda not if that makes sense, all i'll say it it ended really happily and sweetly! 8/10 to a fun clever musical, mainly thanks to Mery Streep!",8,0,1,21 April 2015
Twilight," Enjoyable film
","I think this extremely popular book adaption film, Twilight, was a pretty enjoyable film to watch. Hate me if you want to, but I don't care, I can't lie, I enjoyed the film while I was watching it! Action sequences, a romance, and blood sucking vampires! Now this is by no means going to win an Oscar, but for what it is, it's pretty fun and certainly not a drag. A lot of the men hate this movie along with the others, and yes I'm a guy, but you know what, I don't care, I enjoyed Twilight (2008). Now I didn't exactly love Kristen Stewart, just because I don't think she has much range as an actress, but I thought she was OK in this movie. I also love the way it ended, not gonna say cus of spoilers, but just know I thought it was cool!",7,6,10,11 March 2015
Wreck-It Ralph," Great cute fun!
","Wreck it Ralph sure is a great cute family friendly film! This movie is well written, well animated, and well voiced by the different actors. Sarah Silverman, one of my favorite people ever, stars as the voice of Venelope, and she does such a great job! Her voice fits so well for the main role. And Jane Lynch is a perfect choice for the call of duty like female gamer role! I really loved how this isn't just one of those pointless kiddie movies about nothing special, but this is actually a very well thought out film worthy of many big time cinematic roles. The plot summary is intricate and very smart, this is not a one dimensional movie, this is such a great movie that anyone and everyone can and will enjoy! 8/10.",8,1,2,20 March 2016
Bridesmaids," Loved this!!! Beats the crap out of 21 jump street!!!
","Now this is my kinda comedy!!!! Melissa McCarthy is fantastic in this movie. Well deserved Oscar nomination!!! Okay, comedy film makers need to take a good long look at this movie!!! This is the comedy we need!! This film is so smart, heart warming, hilarious, and has great acting!! And omg for once I loved every character in this movie, no really there wasn't a single character that I disliked!! Wendi, Rose, Melissa, Kristen, rebel, loved em all!!! I had tears rolling down my face I was laughing so hard. I am so glad that we had a great comedy like this come out!!! Amongst all the STUPID comedies that are released, we now have a gem of a funny movie, seriously if u haven't seen this, then put it next on ur list of to-watch!! I promise you won't be disappointed!",9,0,0,8 March 2015
Meet the Fockers," better than the 1st, but still not all that great
","This film did not impress me too much, mainly because i just didn't laugh much at all. Robert De Niro was annoying to me, like in the first one. Ben Stiller was disappointing, like in the first one as well. I'll tell you what makes this sequel better than the it's predecessor, that is Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, they made this movie! Barbra Streisand was very funny along her husband, Dustin Hoffman. Some of the jokes seemed a bit tired and been there done that, which made it boring at times. Overall I'm not the biggest fan of this film series, this series of movies annoys me, and is lazy in my opinion, but of all three films, Meet the Fockers is my personal favorite, I do think that it was the one out of all three, that was the most well-made.",6,0,0,6 May 2015
Revolutionary Road," Unbelievably fabulous performances!
","Revolutionary Road (2008) is a movie that contains wonderful performances by Winslet and DiCaprio. I can't remember the last time I saw such wonderful acting! The intense fighting between the wheelers is so raw and real, absolutely nothing is held back in those scenes, which is the way it should be. Winslet and DiCaprio are the wheelers, who are a married couple with two children. Their marriage is on the brink of absolute disaster. Director Sam Mendes, who incidentally is Winslet's former spouse, directs beautifully here, he really captures the essence of this unhappy married couple, and the many problems they experience throughout the film. Many mature issues are tackled here, including infidelity and abortion. Kathy Bates is in the movie as well, she plays her role well, I mean what else could you expect from the great Kathy Bates. The script and dialogue is so wonderfully written, especially the dialogue between the two leads. Revolutionary Road is a very serious mature movie that is not meant for simple escapist entertainment. So if you are just looking to pass a couple hours by and be mindlessly entertained, then this definitely is not the movie for that. It is a great film that I 100% recommend, that is if you want a very serious, perfectly acted, well written movie. 9/10.",9,0,0,23 November 2016
Cars," Extremely entertaining for all ages!
","Pixar's Cars (2006) truly is an excellent film did everyone to watch and enjoy. The writing is funny, creative, heartwarming at times. And the cast chosen to voice the characters was very well chosen. Owen Wilson is perfect for the voice of lighting McQueen. And Bonnie Hunt was a great fit too. The chemistry between the characters was very sweet and intimate, made you value the characters and the the relationships they held with others. And just let me say that who else could play ToMator soooo perfectly other than Larry the Cable Guy?? I'm not a fan of Larry personally, but he was the PERFECT choice to voice his Redneck down to earth hilarious character. This movie really has all you could ever ask for from a film of this kind. Well written/times humor in the right places, sentimental value, a tad bit of romance, quality dialogue, and great fitting actors to voice the animated characters. I totally suggest giving this animated gem a watch. It'll give you that warm fuzzy feeling with a side of laughs. 9/10 for Cars.",9,0,0,5 April 2017
Gone Girl," Loved loved loved every bit of it!
","This is just an example of awesome filmmaking! Everything worked for this movie! The acting was impeccable, every actor did their job beautifully, and each character was so complex in the film. Everyone had two sides to them, or at Least you come to find out. Rosamund Pike was amazing as our lead actor, very well deserved Oscar nomination and Golden Globe nomination. And let's not forget Ben Affleck our other star. He did a great job of playing the somewhat disturbed and confused husband. This mystery thriller had soo many twists and turns throughout the whole thing! That is what I love, surprises!! I was very shocked to see tyler perry involved in this, but he did very well with his material, and so did Neil Patrick Harris! Warning: if you get unsettled at rough violence or sex, this probably is not the one for you, the whole story is very eery and somewhat dark. Oh, and the ending is mind bending!! Very exciting ending!",9,6,10,10 April 2015
Get Out," Not your run of the mill thriller
","Get Out (2017) is a very well made thriller/horror film. The cast does a great job, especially the parents, Catherine Keener really plays her sedated hypnotist role well. The beginning of the film is ALL about interaction and dialogue that comes into play later on. The chemistry between the actors and the scenes that involve their interaction is all played out very well. The movie then gets more intense and crap starts going down once the star finally figures out what is going on. There are interesting clues and hints that are dropped during the movie that you connect at the end. The ending is well put together too, creepy and climatic. One thing is for sure, you will not leave this film feeling like it was boring or ordinary or stereotypical in any way. And I am sooo thankful for that! I went into this movie wanting it to be just like what the 100% positive reviews were saying. And I was not disappointed in any way. 9/10 for get out.",9,7,18,27 February 2017
Insidious," One of the best horrors I've seen in a while!!
","This is a TRUE horror movie, one that will leave scared to death by the the time it ends. All the actors did a good job here, from Rose Byrne (bridesmaids) to Patrick Wilson (Little Children) and Lin Shaye, who plays the paranormal investigator, this movie is full of really good jump scares, stunning and scary visuals, good dialogue, a touching message about family, and overall just a shocking scary thrill ride! This movie gave me chills when I watched it, it truly is just really scary, especially at night, when I watched it. And the way they ended it, oh my goodness, the ended just leaves you shocked and scared to sleep alone at the same time. You don't really know what to think at the ending, which is good, it was a cool twist! 9/10 for being truly scary and well written!!",9,1,2,22 April 2015

","The best Disney has had in years???!!! Hahahaha. Please!!! Oh my goodness no, poor people must have forgotten about wreck it ralph or cars or cars 2. All of which are better! I was just bored while watching!! The movie lacked in substance, there wasn't much in it, or at Least I didn't think so. I am just confused about how this is praised by so many!! I'm so tired of hearing Let it Go, and building snowmen and everything ughh, just let it die, move on!!! There are plenty of BETTER films out there to dwell on! I think this film is just so overrated by the public and the critics!! The little Swedish salesman was kinda funny, but that's really it, sorry if you loved it, but I can't lie, it Just didn't do much for me.",4,6,12,9 March 2015
2012," A mixed bag.....
","2012 really is a mixed bag. I liked the actors and their performances, including Amanda Peet, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and more. The special effects are also pretty great, it should be, that's what the whole movie is supposed to thrive off of. Now where this film does fall kinda short is the writing. To be completely honest, the dialogue between the characters isn't all that great, just not too creative. Great effects and even good actors unfortunately cannot make up for weak writing. The movie did have some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up nearly as much to what it could've been. There are some interesting scenes involving prophecy and the telling of the end times in the beginning of the movie. Although I did think that Harrelson's performance was a bit too crazy and overly comical. So basically 2012 is a mediocre end of times disaster film with pretty good performances by good actors with less than average writing. 6/10 for 2012.",6,1,1,26 October 2016
The Number 23," Interesting enough to keep your interest
","The Number 23 is a Joel Schumacher film starring Jim Carrey, Virginia Madsen and Logan Lerman. It's a psychological thriller about a man (Jim Carrey) who becomes completely obsessed with a book his wife bought for him entitled 'the number 23'. He starts to add up numbers of all the things in his life and they're all adding up to the number 23 and what is occurring in the book is eerily similar to his own life. This movie was widely panned by critics, audiences were kind of split down the middle by it. I am one of the people who likes it, but doesn't love it. It's not the greatest thriller but it certainly isn't terrible like many many critics stated it was. This is a film that has very good performances by talented actors. Carrey and Madsen are both very good in the movie and don't think either of them got enough credit or any credit at all for their fine intense performances. The script isn't weak per say, it's just not very strong. But to be honest, I wasn't really looking for amazing dialogue, I was looking for an interesting psychological thriller and that's for the most part what I got. The plot has some twists and turns at different points along the way, which is always good, I love a thriller with some twists. This twist was good, not the biggest most shocking reveal ever, but satisfying enough. 7/10 overall for The Number 23.",7,0,3,4 June 2017
P.S. I Love You," How sweet!
","P.S. I love you really is a very sweet heart warming film. Hilary Swank is perfectly cast as holly, the young widow who is receiving letters from her dead husband Jerry while trying to get over him and find a new life. Gerard Butler is also perfectly cast here as Jerry. Kathy Bates is good in her motherly role, and Harry Connick Jr. is alright, kind of a strange role to be honest, but he did alright. Lisa Kudrow is very funny and gives a witty enjoyable performance as the best friend. The script is cute sometimes, dramatic when it wants to be, and then funny when it's appropriate. The beginning of the movie is well done, showing their raw marriage, both the good and the bad side of it. The little striptease by Gerard butler was funny and well placed. Then going from that to the funeral service at the bar was good, showing the grief and emotion. The movie isn't too slow or too fast in pace, I think it's just right. I really did like how the movie had a good range of emotions, rich in both humor and seriousness. The Ireland trip with the best friends was entertaining, and indecently where something good happens (I won't tell you what). I don't why the majority of critics panned the film, I really enjoyed it, and I came out of it feeling satisfied and that I made the right decision by seeing it.",8,0,0,3 December 2016
Stardust," Entertaining
","Stardust is a pretty entertaining fantasy film. One of my favorite aspects of this film is the spot on casting and the acting by the cast members. Michelle Pfeiffer was just so great in her role! She was my favorite part of the entire movie, she just really stole the spotlight. Robert De Niro, who doesn't come in until later on did well and carried his own in my opinion. Claire Danes was perfectly cast in her role as the lead! She was sweet, delightful, enjoyable to watch and very likable. I was just really impressed by the impeccable performances here, very impressive! The love story between the two leads was well paced and put together, I really enjoyed it! The effects were very impressive and cool looking to see as well, not cheap looking at all. The action sequences were pretty good, no complaints here on that part. My one complaint is in the beginning of the movie, the pace was just a little bit too slow for me personally, but that's really my one and only complaint. 8/10.",8,1,1,9 January 2016
Ghostbusters," Pretty entertaining... not fantastic though
","Ghostbusters is a classic 1980s film that everyone has at least heard of, especially because of the 2016 remake starring Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. The original movie stars Bill Murray, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Harold Ramis. It is a comedy movie, the only people that ever think this is a scary movie are small children. The movie is all about these men who form a group and of course they go into the business of ghost busting together. The writing is very comical, it's really not the best comedy in the world, but parts of it are funny. To be honest, I like this movie mainly because of the cast, big Sigourney Weaver fan. The effects were good for the time, now they'd kinda be lacking. The action scenes are done pretty well and I liked the visuals. The movie is one most people will have fun with, it's just not the greatest thing in the world if I'm being 100% honest. I give ghostbusters a 7/10 because it is pretty entertaining, but it is not the best movie in the world.",7,3,6,8 November 2017
Call Me by Your Name," Good, but I didn't love it
","Call me by your name (2017) is now the winner of best adapted screenplay, and was also nominated for other categories, one being best actor (Timothee Charlamet). This film tells the story of Elio and Oliver. Oliver, played by Aarmie Hammer, is a man that has come to stay with Elio and his family. Elio is a 17 year old that starts to fall for Oliver during his time with them. That is where our film's plot lies. I'll be honest by saying that I personally did not love this film as much as the majority of viewers did. But I am in no way bashing the film or saying it's not worthy of praise because some aspects of it are worthy. I'll go over the positives first. The biggest upside to this film is the acting. Both Charlamet and Hammer give great performances, they really do. Charlamet was deserving of the Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. I was very impressed by his work and I connected with his character. Hammer was good as well, and I was also impressed. I didn't really like his character that much, and I didn't care for their chemistry, in fact I felt there was a lack of it. But putting that aside, most of the dialogue is clever and there are good performances to be seen. I just couldn't really get into the story of the two leads. I was very excited to see a gay romance film getting so much attention, because that hasn't really happened since Brokeback Mountain, but I felt slightly disappointed. 7/10.",7,0,1,5 March 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A disappointing spider man film
","This is one of my least favorite superhero films. I don't think Andrew Garfield was a good actor to play spider man. I really thought another actor would've been better suited to play the leading role. Then we have Jamie Foxx, I DID NOT like him in his role, I thought he was very cheesy, nerd like, and I thought he just acted poorly in this movie. I don't think he gave a good performance at all. I did however like Emma stone in her role, I thought she gave a good performance, and I thought she fit the role. The action scenes were pretty good, not great though. I also really liked the scenes with Sally Field as Peter's aunt. I did think those scenes were acted and handled very well. The ending to this film was by far the most disappointing factor in the whole movie! Emma Stone's character Gwen Stacy, Peter's beloved girlfriend, falls to her death, just before it's too late to save her. I realize not all movies get a happy ending, but I thought this ending was crappy and just depressing! Gwen Stacy shouldn't have died! Peter and Gwen should've been able to be together in the end. There were also a couple of other actors that I thought gave mediocre performances. Overall it's a 4/10 at best",4,1,6,16 June 2015
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Not as good as the first or third
","The Twilight Saga: New Moon is probably the the third best in the series. It's not as good or entertaining as the first or eclipse in my opinion. The cast and acting is pretty much all the exact same, it's a little cheesy at times but overall it's fair. The script is average, it's really what you would expect from this type of film. This movie explores Bella's relationship with Jacob (Taylor Lautner). After Edward leaves her because of an attack that nearly kills her, she copes some by her friendship with Jacob. I liked seeing her relationship with Jacob play out and what all that meant, and I think that Kristen Stewart handled this movie well. This installment is less entertaining though than the other ones because there are moments in the movie, long stretches of time where it's pretty dull, nothing much of any importance goes on. And that is why I'm not rating it as high as twilight or eclipse. The movie just becomes boring in places, and I wish they would've done more to make it more interesting in those places. The visual effects are done pretty well, miles better than breaking dawn. Overall, of you're a twilight saga fan, you'll probably like it. I liked it alright, I thought it was fair, but not to the caliber of the first or third, but better than the breaking dawns. 6/10",6,1,2,9 April 2017
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Moving portrayal of a bizarre life
","The curious case of Benjamin Button is a wonderfully made movie. First of all, the cast is full of A list actors that really nail their characters with skilled, talented performances. This movie really classifies as an epic to me, it's made complete with great writing, detailed characters and talented actors to represent those characters. Brad Pitt may be the star and yes he does a good job, but I this is Cate Blanchett's movie. If anyone should have been nominated for an Oscar I think it should've been Blanchett instead of Pitt. Like I said, Pitt does a pretty good job with the lead role, but Blanchett is just mesmerizing as Daisy, Benjamin's life long love. And I'd also like to recognize taraji p. Henson, who plays Queenie, Benjamin adoptive mother. This may be her best performance to date, it'd be between this and Hidden Figures. This movie is unlike any other in its storyline, it's love story, and how it's done. I think it's truly beautiful how Daisy and Benjamin's love throughout both of their lives is told/portrayed. It's all narrated by Brad Pitt himself, although it is read by Blanchett's daughter to Blanchett while she's on her hospital death bed. The dialogue is not dull ever, it's always fresh and so interesting. I loved just listening to the conversations between Benjamin and everyone he came into contact with during the duration of his life. He made many connections with all kinds of different people, although none as strong and powerful as with Daisy. I loved how they chose to end it all too, very moving and touching. 9/10! Great movie that I suggest as long as you don't mind a long length.",9,0,0,15 April 2017
Men in Black II," Well made entertaining sequel
","Men in Black 2 (2002) is of course the sequel to the ever popular Men in Black (1997). I liked the first movie, I wouldn't say that I loved it to the level that most did though. I actually did enjoy this sequel more than I did the first movie, which is an unpopular opinion, but I thought it was more entertaining. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith both reprise their starring roles and I loved both of them in their parts, especially Jones, who is very funny in this one. The villain this time around is played by Lara Flynn Boyle. Boyle plays Serleena, which is an evil alien that takes the form of a Victoria's Secret underwear model. I really loved Boyle and her portrayal of Serleena. Her look was perfect for the role. She was sexy, because of the underwear model thing, but she was also bad ass and she is one of my favorite villains. Johnny Knoxville is her sidekick of sorts, I didn't care for him or his character. He was meant to be humorous and serve as a comedic relief, but in my opinion it didn't really work. His character is more annoying that anything else. But to be completely honest, his character is really the only complaint I have about this movie. The writing is pretty good. I liked the humor, especially when it was between Jones and Smith. I also liked the action scenes for the most part. You for sure won't be disappointed when it comes to special effects and action. Overall I really enjoyed Men in Black 2 (2002) and I recommend it.",8,0,2,29 November 2017
Magic Mike XXL," A lot better than I expected
","Magic Mike XXL was actually a pretty darn good film. The film is directed beautifully! I mean really Magic Mike XXL is just directed beautifully and it's filmed wonderfully. And the acting by all the cast is just great I was so pleased with the acting in this movie. Jada Pinkett Smith blew me away, I thought she did a fantastic job here! Also Matt bomber Channing Tatum Joe and Amber heard all did a great job! You could really tell that everyone was just so passionate about this movie and really cared a lot when they were making it! Now as for the choreography and the stripping and the hot dancing, they freaking nailed it! The stripper sequences were so sexy and well choreographed! But this movie is more than what you think it is, it's not just about hot men. There are some very heartfelt moments with great acting, and I was pleased that it was actually a quality film and not just a porno. Andie McDowell was great, she fit her role so perfectly! She was spot on with the lines and sexy mature dialogue! God her part was just so well written! And like I said before, the writing is well written and very dramatic. I absolutely loved the great chemistry between all the characters! I mean all cast members were so close and had really awesome relationships. And then of course it's freaking awesome to see the hot thongs and Joe's chiseled abs, oh my dear Jesus! Joe had my full and undivided attention the entire time, and so did Channing and Matt of course. I give Magic Mike XXL an 8/10.",8,0,2,21 February 2016
Hidden Figures," Powerful well told story with an important message
","Hidden Figures (2016) is a very moving/powerful story about three African-American females working for NASA in the early 1960s. First of all, the acting and the performances from the three leads are fantastic, very award worthy, Octavia's Oscar nomination was very deserved, I just really wish that taraji p Henson's performance would have been recognized by the academy, because she truly did shine here. The script is masterfully written and the dialogue is fitting. I liked Kirsten Dunst, Kevin Costner, and Jim Parsons too, they fit their respective roles and portrayed them very well. The movie teaches a message of the importance of diversity and it also shows the immense harms that racial segregation back in the 1960s brought to society. And the movie is entertaining as well, it has its light and funny moments amongst the very dramatic and sometimes tense scenes. I highly encourage everyone to see this movie, especially families with children. Messages of diversity and the mistakes that we've made in past history is so important to teach kids. And Hidden Figures does that wonderfully! 8/10 for Hidden Figures.",8,1,8,6 March 2017

","Event Horizon (1997) is for sure one of my favorite science fiction films, I can also count it as one of my favorite horror films because it fits into both genres. It contains strong elements of both horror and sci fi, I love the ways in which it incorporated two kinds of films and combined them into one, never really seen one do it in the way this one did. I like a supernatural element in my horror films, and this film had a very strong supernatural/evil element to it... especially towards the end. I applaud that aspect of the film of the horror side because it just makes everything more interesting. Just hearing the plot really interested me in this film and I'm so glad it didn't disappoint! Basically this film can be summed up as an interesting horror flick with a supernatural element set in space. If that sounds interesting or appealing to you... Then I highly suggest this one! The acting is very well done by each cast member... I was especially impressed by Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne! They really give captivating performances here. 9/10 overall for Event horizon, I would caution though that if you're easily offended by gore then you may wanna be careful lol.",9,1,4,26 June 2018
Mulholland Drive," Took me some time to process afterwards....
","Wow!! What a complex film! I mean I don't think I've ever seen a movie that makes you think more than this one does, but hey that's why it's so excellent. Mulholland Drive stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, and Justin Theroux. It even has a short Billy Ray Cyrus cameo lol. The acting is just wonderful! I adored Watts and Harring! Naomi Watts can go from being so kind sweet and simple in one version of herself to being disheveled and washed up. She handles the lead role with such skill. And Laura Harring plays her role very well, realistic and believable. And Theroux does a pretty good job with his performance, his isn't quite as big/important as Harring and Watts's are. The script is very close to perfection. A script for a film like this must to be written very carefully and be very specific and detailed. If it wouldn't have been then it wouldn't have been nearly as interesting. That's the main thing about Mulholland Drive, it is COMPLEX and WEIRD lol. But I think that's a great thing. We need more mystery thrillers that are made like this and do this to viewers. I know now after doing some brief research how and what the movie was saying at the end. At first I had absolutely no idea, but then the pieces started to be put together. And it started to make some sense. This really is an excellent movie that will give your brain a real work out! I totally suggest it. And stay with it, it's kind of long and you've got to be patient with it. 10/10!",10,3,4,9 April 2017
Evil Dead," Way too much blood! Rating Would've been higher if there wasn't so much blood
","This 2013 remake contains far too much graphic gore! I hate it when horror films feel like they must dump buckets of blood all over the movie! This movie needed to tone down the digusting graphic and pervasive gore. There were some parts of the film were good, like the beginning. The beginning might've been the best part, it was so creepy and it really started the movie off with a bang! I also thought that Jane Levy was a great choice for the lead role. I also enjoyed the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, that part was done really well. But the in between was where the digusting blood bath took place! You lose me when you just dump buckets of blood in the middle of the movie! There were a couple of scenes that were especially grotesque and just terribly digusting! Hard to watch even. I mean cutting your own tongue in half with a knife! Just gross! I really didn't care for that. I like the last part where the lead is being chased by the thing that arose from underground, while the blood rain falls from the sky. I also don't like that the leads brother was killed! I wanted both to make it out, but at least the lead made it out alive! I guess I should be thankful that somebody survived, since In some films, no one does, I hate it when that happens!! Would've been tons better without the grotesque and constant gore, I can deal with blood in a movie, but not to this extant, this was just over the top! 6/10",6,0,2,29 June 2015
The Imitation Game," Very well told true story
","The Imitation Game is a great movie that is based off of true, real life events during WWII. The performances are magnificent! Cumberbatch and Knightly are wonderful in their portrayals of these historical people. Benedict Cumberbatch is a fine, skilled actor and this Oscar nominated performance showcases that, it puts his raw talent up on display for all to see. The same goes for Keira Knightly, she is a a very talented actress, anyone who has seen her movies knows that for damn sure. The sets, the costume design, and how everything is constructed makes for a near perfect representation of WWII times in Britain. The script is also very well written and it showcases both the historical events that occurred and the backgrounds and personal horror the individual people go through. The main one I'm of course talking about is Cumberbatch's character Alan Turing. Turing endured many many down right atrocities and horrific treatment in his lifetime. He was gay and had to keep it a secret since it was illegal and you'd get in very big trouble if you were found out to be LGBTQ. They made him undergo cruel physical treatment to 'change' him, which is extremely sad and tragic to see. But I'm so glad to see that the filmmakers accurately portrayed this and had facts about the inhumane, dehumanizing treatment of homosexuals during that time in history. All in all, this is a wonderfully made film that I recommend to everyone.",10,0,1,13 March 2017
The Evil Dead," Fantastic classic horror film
","The Evil Dead (1981) is a classic horror film, one of the most famous ones in history. This film really earns it's title of being one of the best. It does not rely upon big special effects or a very large budget to make it effective. it is a very effective horror film without these things, which is what too many scary movies rely on heavily. Everything starts out with a group of young adults in a car heading out to a secluded cabin in the woods, as you can guess, things get pretty bad from there on. I loved the classic, creepy atmosphere all throughout the film, it contributed to the overall dark feel. The cast does a good job here, I really enjoyed their performances. Bruce Campbell in particular stands out, very enthusiastic performance. The makeup was oh so well done, i loved the scary evil look the people had to them when they became possessed by the demonic spirit. Not only was the look great, but oh my god I loved the demons voice, sounded perfect. Eerie and creepy as hell, very effective as far as the voice goes. Overall, this really is a fabulous horror film and I recommend it. 9/10.",9,1,2,22 December 2017
Shrek 2," Not nearly as good as the original Shrek In my opinion
","Shrek 2 (2004) wasn't awful, although it most definitely was not nearly as good as the classic Shrek. My favorite part and favorite character from Shrek 2 was the fairy godmother voiced by Jennifer Saunders, who plays the main villain in the movie, her character was wonderfully constructed and wonderfully voiced by Mrs. Saunders. Charming was voiced well by Rupert Everett, and I enjoyed his character. But for me, Shrek 2 just didn't live up to my expectations based on the 1st Shrek. The animation and effects were good, but I felt like the execution of the plot was a little weak, and the movie as a whole just wasn't as enjoyable as the original classic Shrek that almost of America fell in love with. I know that a lot of critics fell just as much in love with this movie as the original Shrek, but it just didn't work for me.",5,1,2,2 October 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Well made action film
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a unique film. I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10.",8,18,26,28 February 2018
Saw II," Not too impressive
","Saw II (2005) is of course the sequel to the famous Saw (2004). This sequel didn't really impress me all that much. I'll start with what I didn't really care for in the movie. One of the negatives about the movie is some of the cast members acting ability. Tobin Bell and Donnie Wahlberg both turn in good performances, but to be honest, the other actors just didn't really sell me on their performances or pull me into it the movie more. Another one of the negatives is that the movie as a whole isn't all that interesting. The first Saw movie is undoubtedly the best in the series, and it surpasses this second installment. To be completely honest, if you watch Saw for the traps, then you probably won't like this one, the jigsaw traps aren't that interesting or creative at all. The characters, except for Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) and his teenage son, don't have much depth at all, which made me not really care about them very much. The writing is slightly below average. So all in all, Saw II gets a 4/10, just not a very entertaining film. I don't even think fans of the Saw films would enjoy it very much.",4,1,1,21 November 2017
Jerry Maguire," Very well acted film!
","Perhaps one of the most quoted movies is Jerry Maguire (1996). So is it really worth all the hype? I think so! Tom cruise and Renee Zellweger give masterful performances in this sports agent drama. Tom of course is always great, he's one of my very favorites, but if I'm being honest, Zellweger shines the most of all here. 'You had me at hello'. That probably is the most popular quote of the whole film, and it's deserving of that title. That is just good heartfelt writing, some may think it's cheesy or overly cliché, but I just think it's her character being honest about her true love for cruise's character. Cuba Gooding Jr. is the actor who won the academy award for his supporting performance, and yes it's true, he is very good here, I'm not totally certain it was worth an Oscar, but it's still good work. The script is pretty well written, it's all centered about tom cruise and his revelation as a person, and the romance between Zellweger and him is all apart of his big change in himself. The chemistry between all the actors on screen is good and believable, cruise and Zellweger having the best and most real seeming. I suggest this movie for both men and women, young and old, you certainly do not have to enjoy sports to enjoy this. Hell I'm living proof of that. 8/10 for Jerry Maguire.",8,2,3,17 March 2017
Jurassic World," Brought back the magic that is Jurassic World
","Jurassic World was a very pleasurable experience to watch and enjoy. The introduction of a brand new genetically modified dinosaurs was clever, and probably one of the only things they could've done in a new installment. The cast gets a big party of the success of this film. Bryce Dallas Howard was great here, aside from her acting, she ran in heels through entire movie, I don't care what you say, that's impressive. Chris Pratt was awesome in his role, he really nailed it! The film had great action sequences, good special effects and pretty good dialogue too. They really transformed and modernized Jurassic park for a new generation. The kids were great in their roles as well! I'm glad this film is getting good reviews so far, it deserves it! It wasn't too gory or disturbing, it had just enough roughness and gore. But overall it was very fun and entertaining! I think if your a Jurassic world fan, you'll like it!",7,2,8,3 July 2015
Paranormal Activity," A quality horror movie!
","Just like Insidious, this is just a great horror movie, it does it's job of really scaring you, and without showing any blood or guts in the process, which is rare these days. This movie doesn't show a lot, which means it'a left up to your imagination, and that is powerful when it comes to a horror movie! The actors are unknowns, and they did a great job with their roles. The found footage style worked for this film! It really made it extra-scary. I was just left feeling very scared and shaken, and the ending was gold, just like Insidious! 10/10 for Paranormal Activity! I don't think Paranormal Activity could've been any better!",10,1,2,22 April 2015
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Weird, stupid and mis-casted
","OK, first of all, Johnny Depp was a crappy Willy Wonka. He was soo ugly and weird in the role, I felt uncomfortable watching him play Willy Wonka, there are much better actors out there that are better suited to portray this character! This whole film just annoyed me, made me feel uncomfortable, and I just felt empty after it. Also I'm not a Johnny Depp fan, so that had a little to do with whether I liked it or not. Although I do feel like the grandfather and little boy were excellent! If only Johnny Depp could've matched them! Also I just felt like this was a very week and poor remake. I will say the scenery, visuals, and costumes were very good. But that's about it. Overall a 3/10, don't understand it's popularity!",3,2,4,19 March 2015
Black Snake Moan," A different kind of movie
","Black Snake Moan (2006) is a very interesting movie, it's one of a kind. It has an A list Hollywood cast. Veteran actor Samuel L Jackson, child star Christina Ricci, and singer Justin Timberlake. The actors are well cast and I think they all did a pretty good job with their individual roles. Jackson plays a man who's wife has left him for another man. And Christina Ricci plays a sexually abused women who's boyfriend (Justin Timberlake) has left for the military. Ricci's character is left beaten and bruised on the side of the road, and Jackson's character finds her and brings her into his house to care for her. Then that is when the movie really takes off. The movie executes its plot in a way that gives depth to all the characters, so that is good, but there are times where you aren't sure how to feel about certain characters and there are moments that feel kind of awkward. Luckily those times aren't rampant throughout the film, but they are there. Overall, the movie isn't one I would 100% recommend to any and everyone, but I liked the connections made between the characters. This movie is probably worth watching just once just for the connections and deep characters. 7/10.",7,1,1,11 September 2017
Friends with Benefits," So close......
","Friends with benefits is complicated. This movie does feature some good performances, including Justin Timberlake, Mila kunis, and woody harrelson. The script is alright, cliché at times. You may be surprised to know that this movie actually does have a sweet undertone and heart felt moments. Sure, there are racy sex scenes involved, of course there are, you know that from the title, but this movie has more to it than just that. There are some funny lines, but unfortunately not enough. The movie drags a bit at times, it slows down and you really don't want it too, so that's one issue. The sex scenes are comical and hot, and they work for this film. Also the sexual content and nudity isn't too overly graphic, so it isn't uncomfortable or awkward in any way. So overall a 6/10, almost, but not quite.",6,0,1,22 March 2016
Men in Black," Fairly entertaining sci fi comedy
","Men in Black (1997) is one of the most famous science fiction films ever. And it's probably what made Will Smith a notable actor. Men in Black is about a secret organization who polices alien activity. They know all about the alien world and keep earth and its inhabitants safe from danger when it comes to alien matters. This movie stars Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Jones is the elder agent in the organization and Smith plays the rookie, the new agent. The acting is skillful and I loved the way Jones and Smith both portrayed their characters. Smith does it in a very humorous way, and his comedic talent is really utilized in this film. Jones is still funny at times, but his character is very serious, but it works for his character because of things you find out about his past. I liked the screenplay alright. The really big thing that this film had going for it was the special effects, and it was good for 1997 at the time of its release, but to be honest they wouldn't be considered that impressive in today's world of cinema. The film has a very fun atmosphere to it and I would suggest it moderately. It's not the absolute best of its kind but it's still pretty fun. 7/10.",7,1,1,29 November 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Imaginative, unique love story
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) is one of the best films I've ever seen. The plot revolves around Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey). They play a couple who's relationship has crumbled. Clementine ends up going to a doctor who specializes in this procedure that erases memories you would like to forget, and she erases all memory of Joel. After Joel finds out that she has done this, he also decides to have the procedure done. During the procedure, he starts to change his mind and doesn't want to let go of certain memories of her.This film features incredible performances by every single cast member. Kate Winslet in particular gives a remarkable performance, very deserving of that Academy Award nomination. And Jim Carrey is also great here, this is probably my favorite film of his filmography. If anyone thinks Carrey is only capable of doing comedy, then I'd suggest they watch this one, because he nails it. Kirsten Dunst gives a skilled supporting performance, as does Ruffalo, Wilkinson, and Wood. The writing is so well done and balanced. The dialogue between Clementine and Joel is very revealing and written in a beautiful way. When you cast great artists such as the two leads and give them writing like this, it's just bound to be a hit. I for sure suggest this wonderful film! 9/10.",9,1,1,20 March 2018
Elysium," Kind of a let down
","I was expecting more and better than what I got with 2013's Elysium. The cast wasn't bad, in fact, I think Foster and Damon gave good performances and had pretty good on screen chemistry together. The issue I took with Elysium, was the poor writing and sorta weak plot summary. The plot summary and execution of it was pretty run of the mill, and formulaic. I would've appreciated a little more creativity and or originality. This movie was all around a pretty boring experience, it just simply did not entertain me. Jodie Foster was good, she looked stunning in her wardrobe and is impressively good for her age. Matt Damon was alright I guess, he was tough in the action sequences, which is nice, but he lacked some when he wasn't blowing up s**t. The rest of the cast is OK, nothing too bad. Elysium could've and should've been better than it is. 5/10 for Elysium.",5,0,1,8 April 2016
Taken," Entertaining action film, but a bit overrated
","Taken (2008) is a pretty entertaining action film that features good acting all around. If I had to sum up the basis of this movie in one sentence, that would be it. It's not the best action film I've seen, it's just pretty good. The movie has been overrated, a 7.8 rating is just too high for this one. It's not worthy of a 7.8 IMDb rating. Yes, Liam Neeson is good in the starring role, even if some of his acting is a little cheesy at times. Maggie Grace is fine, I honestly wasn't impressed by her performance, but I didn't think she was bad. And the rest of the cast is fine too. The action is done very well if that's what you're looking for. The movie will keep your attention 80% of the time. I really don't know why the movie has been loved to the point it has been, I just see it as another pretty good action movie, to be honest it's not all that different from the other action movies that regularly come out. I do recommend the film if you like action, if you'd like something deeper than a regular action movie, then I would say maybe keep looking. I enjoyed it a fair amount, but I wouldn't be all too hyped to watch it again. 7/10.",7,0,0,9 August 2017
Alice in Wonderland," Visuals will only take you so far...
","I really did like the visuals in this film. But a good film needs more than just good visuals. Helena Bonham Carter was not the right choice for the red queen in my opinion. And tweedle dee and tweedle dumb were the worst things in the whole thing!! Don't even get me started on Johnny Depp ohh my lord! He was terrible in this, couldn't have been a worse choice for the mad hatter. I'm so tired of the Depp-Burton show! It worked for Edward Scissorhands but not this!! When Johnny Depp did that little dance at the end, I just started laughing ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Oh my goodness that was just embarrassing! So basically if you want stunning visuals, this is for you, but if you actually want a good movie to go along with stunning visuals, go see 2015 Cinderella. That is far better than this!",4,1,2,7 April 2015
The Mummy Returns," An entertaining and satisfying sequel!
","The Mummy Returns, which was released in 2001, is a sequel to the 1999 hit, The Mummy. This movie is a very worthy and fun to watch sequel. The actors all hold their own in throughout the film and do a wonderful job at portraying their roles. Brendan Frasier does a great job in the action sequences along side Rachel Weisz. The new characters are very well put together as well. I really enjoyed the villains in this movie, especially the scorpion King, played by the very well cast Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. He truly is perfect for the role of the scorpion King, tough, muscular, good looking, and able to do the hardcore action adventure scenes true justice. On to The special effects. The special effects are very well done in this flick, very cool and realistic looking, well for the most part that is, there is one scene at the end where the special effects are actually pretty bad looking. The end part where the scorpion King is resurrected, the cgi in that scene is very poor, but that's the only bad part with the special effects, the rest are great! This movies plot summary was also very pleasing and satisfying, the plot was original and creative. 8/10 for the mummy returns.",8,3,3,17 December 2015
Avatar," James Cameron strikes again
","Okay so I wanna talk for a minute about James Cameron. James Cameron is one of my all time favorite filmmakers ever, he is proven to be a true master at directing films. Look at his body of work and you shall see, it really speaks for itself. Avatar is a masterpiece in many ways to me. There's the amazing special effects and visuals that were so revolutionary back at the time of it's release in 2009. And those visuals really are incredible, seeing Pandora and all it's illustriousness is so enchanting. The effects pull you in, and the talented actors keep you interested in the captivating story. The actors really do a great job here, Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, and Michelle Rodriguez all give it their all here. The characters are likable and the film makes you care about them and root for them. The story is kinda predictable i guess, meaning there aren't a whole lot of big twists, but that's ok by me because the film is done in such a magnificent way that it doesn't need anything like that. Bottom line: this is a great story told by talented actors and illustrated with spectacular visual effects. There are also moments of real emotion here, and that's due to the depth in the characters. I 100% recommend Avatar to any and everyone! I'm so excited for these sequels!",10,5,6,7 July 2018
Drag Me to Hell," A rarity
","I feel like Drag me to hell is a real rarity, you don't see horror films this good on a regular basis. This film is very well written, well acted, and the visuals work well. I was very pleased with the main actors performances and I like the plot, it was interesting, I don't know of a another movie with this specific kind of plot, it is unique in that respect. The movie is definitely exciting, it keeps you guessing what's gonna happen next, and on the edge of your seat. The horror sequences work well thanks to the creepy/eerie atmosphere, the actors in them, and the well constructed special effects. The possession scene/seance scene is one of the best parts because it is so creepy and cool to see. The attack scene in the beginning is cool too, it's scary and makes for a very twisted/eerie atmosphere. The ending is something that I have mixed feelings about. Part of me liked it cus it was a twist, and part of me didn't Cus it wasn't really settling lol, trying to pinpoint the correct word to describe it. Well anywho, I'll just let you check out this well made horror movie for yourself and see what you think about the ending. 9/10 for Drag me to hell.",9,0,0,15 May 2016
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Not the best, but definitely not the worst.
","This twilight installment is at times entertaining, and at other times somewhat boring and you just wish it would move along a little faster. All the characters are just the same as they have always been throughout the entire franchise, no surprise there. Some of the scenes were rather cheesy as far the dialogue, but that was sort of expected. I didn't really like how Renesme looked strangely animated, it wasn't natural looking at all, so that was weird looking. The action scenes were well done, and exciting to watch, that's the main thing the film had going for it. Overall, I can only give this movie a 6/10, not horrible, not great. Eclipse was much better (my personal favorite).",6,1,9,1 August 2015
There's Something About Mary," Cameron Diaz steals the show
","In this Farraly brothers flick, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon, and Ben stiller all team up to tell us what is so special about Mary. Cameron is definitely the best part of this movie, she really does show her acting chops here. Matt Dillon does alright in his sleezy dirt bag role. Lin Shaye is great in the role of Magda, I enjoyed her funny whacky performance. As for Ben stiller, he did alright I suppose, but personally, I would've preferred a different male lead actor. The comedy works just fine, although it was a bit too crass for my taste at times, like the 'hair gel' scene for instance, didn't really need to see that LOL. The movie is well paced too, the pace isn't too fast or too slow, it didn't drag, but didn't really feel rushed. There is something about Mary, she stars in a comedy movie that isn't half bad, I actually didn't expect to like it as much as I did. 7/10 for There's something about Mary.",7,0,0,14 May 2016
Saw," A lot better than I expected
","Saw (2004) is actually a pretty well made film, though it does have its flaws. The actors do exceedingly well with their roles. Danny Glover is a great presence to have in the movie, he brings his detective character to life, and he's such a joy to watch on screen. Leigh Wannell is amazing here, and I loved him in this film, he is intense, dramatic, and very focused. His character, Adam, is really a great character, and I loved seeing him attempt to figure what hell was going on. This movie is written well, and has the correct amount of intensity and energy about it. One of the flaws, is that a few of the most disturbing and grotesque images could've easily not been there, there was absolutely no need for me to see the insides of a mans stomach, that one shot could've been cut and it wouldn't have harmed the film at all. I wish they would have cut those few most gross images, because in my opinion, it brought the movie down instead of lifting it up in quality. Tobin Bell played his role menacingly and was completely evil, as he should have, even though he didn't get tons of screen time. The plot is clever, and it's well executed. The ending is clever, even though I couldn't help but feel sad for Adam, and no that doesn't make me some wuss or whatever, but come on he was a decent innocent guy and then that happened to him, even though yes it was a bone chilling, clever ending. So all in all, a clever well made film, with some flaws which I've already mentioned. And it's a hell of a lot better than Saw 3D, which I've already reviewed. 8/10.",8,1,4,31 May 2016
Mama," Unsatisfying horror movie
","Mama left me very disappointed! The special effects were very cheep looking, the whole movie was not scary. The acting was just alright, nothing special. The movie drug in the middle, kinda got boring. The dialogue wasn't all that great either. One part I did enjoy was Jessica Chastain, she was a good fit for her role, and was very enjoyable. Also, the ending was very unsatisfactory to me, it was sort of like a dead end to me. Overall, this film is boring, bland, poorly put together, and to be honest not worth your time. I think they had a good concept, but ultimately just failed to deliver and follow through on that concept. 3/10.",3,2,4,29 August 2015
Sinister," Very well made modern day horror
","This horror movie is one of the best I've ever seen. From the fantastic acting to the scary scenes that will genuinely creep you out, none of those cheap jump scares crap, I mean like actually being frightened. Baghoul is an evil spirit/presence in the movie, but he's not like a monster made of CGI effects that you see throughout the movie, you see his handiwork more than you actually see him, but in my opinion, his handiwork is much scarier than them actually showing you his face. Because to me what you make up in your own mind and your own imagination is scarier than them just showing you the thing you're supposed to be afraid of. They do use that method and it works wonderfully in this movie. The cast is very good and I loved all the performances. Ethan Hawke is a very talented actor, I've known that since Dead Poets Society when he was just starting out. He gives a very good performance as the writer father who begins to research this thing that has haunted and killed other innocents in the past. As he digs deeper and deeper the movie gets even more entertaining (and scarier). I suggest this movie to anyone who likes a very well-made horror movie. It is directed very well and it's evident that the writers knew exactly what they were doing. 8/10 for Sinister.",8,6,7,7 April 2017
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Better than the first
","Well the Christmas season will be upon us soon! To help celebrate my all time favorite time of year, I have certain holiday movies. Home Alone 2: lost in New York is one of my favorites. This sequel to the 1990 hit is better than the original in many ways if you ask me. Culkin is no different here, he's just fine, like in the original. What is better/different here is the quality of comedy and the entertainment value. The first home alone certainly isn't bad, but I do feel like this one exceeds the original as far as entertainment goes. Joe Pesci and his assistant Marv (the sticky bandits) are even better/funnier here than the first time around. The action is better here, and in my opinion, the acting is better. I really loved Catherine O'Hara here too, thought she was hilarious in her role, and the dialogue her character is given really helps boost her funny, touching performance. 'The way I'm feeling no mugger/murderer would dare mess with me'. Lol bravo. John heard is fine here, his acting/character really doesn't have to be good in any way, his character is okay just kinda being there. The subplot with Kevin and the homeless woman who saves him is very sweet and touching, I really do love that they included that in the film's plot, really added a lot to it. Tim Curry is also to be applauded too for his funny performance as the Ritz hotel manager. 8/10.",8,1,2,22 November 2016
National Treasure," Entertaining family movie
","National Treasure really is a cute family movie. The action isn't too rough and the violence isn't bloody at all, so it's suitable. The movie is all about these two men who are searching down in an old abandoned ship under a big frozen lake, while they're searching they find these clues to a big treasure, and one of them is to steal the Declaration of Independence. Nicholas Cage and his friend Riley try to convince Sean Bean's character to not do it but of course he and his men decide to anyways. And that begins the endless chase and race that drives the film. I liked all the actors. Cage is good here, and so is Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, and Jon Voight (Cage's father in the movie). The script is pretty average for a film like this. It's not to a great level, but it's not bad, really it gives you enough you need and then that's it, it doesn't try to dazzle you or anything, but it also won't let you down. The ending is well done, I enjoyed it very much. And the visuals are nicely done. All in all, it's an entertaining live action Disney treasure hunt movie that's mild enough for family viewing. 8/10.",8,1,1,10 April 2017
Total Recall," I've seen a lot better.......
","First of all, I did enjoy the casting, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sharon Stone were both very believable and fitting for both of their roles. The special effects weren't bad either, especially for 1990! The problem came in with the dialogue, and the plot line. The dialogue just wasn't much and came across as lazy to me, and the plot line dwindled, and I got bored with the film. I wish the movie would've kept a constant tone throughout, but it just didn't ðŸ˜•. This is just one of those movies that started out well, but went on a downward spiral as it went along. So, unfortunately I can't recommend this film, 4/10 for Total Recall (1990).",4,1,6,11 July 2015
Eyes Wide Shut," A film exploring marriage with some flaws
","Eyes wide shut certainly is a peculiar movie, but it's intriguing, which is the main reason I watched it one night. This movie does feature very good performances by the lead actors, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I was very impressed by their performances. The plot of the movie is kinda hard to explain, basically it's about Tom Cruise's character's one night exploration of himself and of moral and sexual discoveries after his wife, played by Nicole's character tells him that one time she came close and considered cheating on him. So as you can probably imagine, you're in for very intense, graphic sexual content and a lot of male and female nudity (both rear and full frontal). So if that sort of thing offends you, then stay away, Cus it's in this film for sure! Personally, it didn't bother me a whole whole lot, but in a couple of scenes it got to be just a little much. Now the movie's script is well written and intelligent, that was nice to see. In my opinion, Tom Cruise was the best part of this film, his performance was gripping, and he sure did look good doing it lol, but seriously, he was awesome here! And Nicole gave one of her best performances ever in this film, she was so real and dramatic! Stanley Kubrick did do a pretty good job with this movie, it was shot beautifully, and intelligently. I appreciate this film's intelligence, you can sure tell that a lot of hard work went into the making of this film. This movie is very psychological and interesting to watch. It ultimately is just about tom and Nicole's marriage and about why she considered cheating on him, and how tom gets through it and how he deals with it. I would have preferred less nudity and a little less sex, that would've been nice. I'm perfectly alright with having some female/male nudity, and I'm alright with sex scenes, as long as they aren't like porn. I just feel like In a couple scenes the amount of sex/nudity sort of took away from the main objective of the movie and in a way distracted the audience. And the ending to Eyes Wide Shut is in my humble opinion one of the greatest endings in cinema history, it's so well acted, and well written, and it's refreshing to see how they resolved everything, it's a true testament to the word marriage. This is a good film for married couples to see, but you might wanna zip through one scene or 2, just because as I said previously, the amount of nudity can be a little distracting. 7/10 overall for Eyes Wide Shut.",7,0,0,18 January 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Incredible! Better than the original.
","2017's live action remake of Disney's beauty and the beast is by far better than the original 1991 film. First off, the visual effects and designs are absolutely breathtaking! The set designs are so eloquent and beautiful. Then the costumes, the period costumes are very true to the original and accurate. And the casting is one hundred percent perfect. Emma Watson is a great Belle, she looks a lot like her, speaks a lot like her, and represents the starring character very well. Dan Stevens is good beast, even though you don't get to see him in human form till the very end. And throughout the rest of the film the CGI is so well done and the Beast looks great, doesn't look fake at all. I enjoyed Kevin Kline as belles father very much, he just looks like the character when you first see him and when he talks you just know that was a perfect casting decision. I adored Emma Thompson as Miss Potts, her beautiful singing voice gave me chills, she lit up the screen. There could not have been a better casting choice for LaFou other than Josh Gadd, and if anyone was surprised by his character being gay then I seriously wonder if you have ever seen original film, I applaud Disney for promoting diversity and even giving his character a love interest at the end. Luke Evans as Gaston could not have been better! The writing is very similar to the original animation and it works very well. The musical numbers will blow you away and fill you with awe and wonder. Be my guest is absolutely wonderful. I honestly can't say anything bad about this wonderful film. Take someone to BE YOUR GUEST and go see this! 10/10",10,10,27,18 March 2017
Pretty Woman," Hooker fairytale
","Pretty Women is an absolute American film classic. There are some Americans out there that haven't seen it but I know they must have at the very least heard of it. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere star as the films romantic leads. Julia is a prostitute in Hollywood who gets in this very rich man's car one night to give him directions in exchange for money. This man is of course Richard Gere. They go to his fancy hotel and talk and hang out and eventually get to sex before the night is over. I enjoyed the dialogue in the film very much, Roberts and Gere have some really good writing in the scenes they share together. And Roberts is just perfect in the role, I don't think anyone else could've played her character nearly as well as she did. And the same thing goes for Richard Gere, very professional actor, very calm demeanor, and I think that worked for his character in this movie. Another actor that I loved in the movie was hector elizondo, I don't particularly know why but I just loved seeing him interact with Roberts and kind of be her guiding hand with some things she had to learn. It was sweet and charming. The romantic chemistry is very natural and it flows nicely throughout between the two. I liked the sex scenes, I thought they were beautifully done, very well filmed and romantic. All in all I suggest this 1990 romantic comedy-drama because it is just charming and features great performances. 8/10.",8,0,2,26 April 2017
The Descent," Well made horror film
","The Descent (2005) is definitely a well made horror movie. The film is about a group of women who decided to explore a cavern, One of whom has just a year ago lost her young daughter. The group of friends go down into the cavern and start to explore, but soon become lost and come to the realization that they might not be able to find a way out. And if that isn't bad enough they start to hear these strange noises and the star of the film sees these weird creatures and they discover that they are not alone down there, these creatures that lurk in the dark are flesh eating monsters that hunt on the surface and then bring their food down to the bottom of the cavern to eat. I will definitely say that this movie is very well acted and I think that the script and dialogue is well written. I really liked how they made the creatures look, and I loved the whole cavern setting, the setting really did a lot to increase the creepy feeling the whole film had to it, especially towards the end. I think it's safe to say that if you do not like tight spaces or dark settings or creepy creatures then this is not the movie for you. The ending is different based on whether you see the UK or US version. I had mixed feelings about the ending (I originally saw the U.K. Version by the way). And I do prefer the UK version to the US version because I think the US version's ending is disappointing. I would definitely suggest seeing either the unrated version or the UK version just because I think the ending is more interesting compared to the U.S. theatrical release. I give The Descent an 8/10.",8,1,3,30 November 2016
Inside Man," Top Noche!
","Inside man is an excellent film starring Denzel Washington and Jodie foster. Denzel, Jodie, and Clive Owen all work together very well on screen, and they play their individual characters perfectly, I really loved the casting for this movie. The plot summary is also very intriguing and it pulls you in, trust me, you won't want to stop watching this movie until the very end, there definitely won't be any walk outs or people quitting on it before it's over. Clive Owen is such a meticulous and wise/sharp robber here, I was very impressed with the words he chose and his mannerisms and how he interacted with the detectives and police. You realize that this robber is very clever and that he knows what he's doing. And you won't actually know what the movie is all about until the end comes, this is not the average bank robbery cookie-cutter plot, this movie has many very different layers to it. I really liked the pacing of this movie too, I didn't think the pacing was too slow or too fast, I thought it was just right. The critics got it right with this movie, it is excellent. The run time is good too, it's a little over two hours, but the longevity of the film is very necessary. Inside Man receives a 9/10! I 100% recommend this film. The ending is very smart and clever too, I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that the robber knows what he's doing.",9,0,2,3 July 2016
The Da Vinci Code," Very dull film
","2005's The Da Vinci code movie is a very dull and just flat out boring movie that's not worth the time to watch it. The storyline is lacking and the idea is an interesting idea but the execution of the plot falls flat. The actors really do try their best to save the movie, but they cannot save it from the dull script and the lackluster execution. Tom Hanks is just OK in the film I felt like he could've been better though. And the other main actress along with Ian McKellen do all right in the film, not great. At first I was really excited to see this movie because I thought that it was going to be an exciting controversial film about the foundation of religion and it being toppled, but it just turned out to be a boring dumb movie about this discovery rocking the foundations of Christianity. It's true that there were one or two scenes that kind of peaked my interest, but it was only one or two scenes out of over 100. So the da Vinci code unfortunately will only receive a 3 on a scale of ten.",3,0,1,17 December 2015
Titanic," A true James Cameron masterpiece
","Titanic is for sure one of the most beloved films ever made, especially by the Academy in the year it came out. I believe it is very deserving of the many praises it has received over the years. i know there are people that claim it's terrible and i think it's mostly guys who roll their eyes at the romance involved. Ok so i think the acting from the very talented cast is well done. Winslet and DiCaprio are both doing their absolute best here, which is great because they really are two very gifted actors. i believe their love story because of the chemistry between them. I think the drawing scene and the car scene are both very beautifully done, handled well. The expressions on their faces portray real love and affection, but they both at the same time show a sense of vulnerability too. The other actors are very convincing as well, one that deserves praise is Kathy Bates, who plays Molly Brown. She had a great, believable energy about her, and she provides some fun comedic relief too. Gloria Stuart is so amazing here, she might be my favorite member of the cast, it may be a tie between her and DiCaprio because they're both so great. The visual effects in this film are just flat out incredible! They still hold up today and they are so realistic and breathtaking to watch. The soundtrack is great and I think it fits the film's tone. Overall, James Cameron knows what he's doing and he has people around him who also know what they're doing, so it results in a wildly entertaining, smart film, one that I will forever call a masterpiece.",10,1,4,8 March 2015
In Time," Entertaining Justin Timberlake film
","In Time (2011) starring Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, and Olivia Wilde was actually a pretty good movie. This movie has a very interesting plot and very good acting. Justin and Amanda has great on screen chemistry together, and Olivia really does do a great job as Justin's mom. This film is also written well and has really cool looking visuals. This movie can be enjoyed by any teen or adult looking for a fun, entertaining, visually stunning good time. The romance between the two leads was very real and authentic looking. Matt Bomer also appeared in a small cameo here, he was nice to see, even though his role was very small. There were some scenes that drug just a little, but luckily they were far and few in between. The costume design for the film is also well done, same goes with the makeup and hair styling. The action sequences are pretty fun and well constructed. 7/10 for In Time.",7,0,0,19 January 2016
The Happening," Laughably poor movie
","The Happening is by far Shamylan's WORST. I mean it's just so laughably terrible and hopelessly dull. It's void of any kind of quality filmmaking or anything that's remotely interesting. And I like Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel both as actors, but their performances in this film are just plain god awful, you're watching it and the whole time you're just looking to yourself my goodness are they even giving any attempt at all to be good? Because their performances either look like just a bad acting from a TV horror movie or purposefully bad from an SNL skit. And even if this movie was trying to be bad on purpose in order to be comical, it would still fail miserably. There is just nothing at all of any value in this movie. I mean there's just nothing good about, it there's absolutely no reason for you to watch this movie. Scene by scene by scene it just seems to get progressively worse. A lot of times, you hope that just the beginning of the movie is bad and that as it progresses, it will get better. Well save your hopes for another day, because there is no point in hoping for that with this film. The plot actually interested in me and I thought that it would be intriguing. This may be the worst case I've seen of an interesting plot being completely wasted. 1/10.",1,4,6,7 April 2017
Mystic River," A tragic tale
","Mystic River (2003) revolves around three central characters. Those characters are played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon. Then there's the wives of Robbins and Penn, who provide support to the story. I wanna first start out by saying that the performances here are just great, I was blown away by everyone. This movie HAS to have good acting or else the whole thing will just fall apart completely. This is very much a somber drama, a tragic tale of these old childhood friends. There are many difficult issues like sexual abuse, pedophilia, murder, and the loss of a loved one that happen in this film and its handled in a tasteful way. I'll admit that I didn't love this one as much as I thought I would, but I did enjoy it and admired the skillful way in which it was made. The acting is really what deserves to be focused on and praised here. 8/10 for Mystic River",8,1,1,29 June 2018
Zombieland," Not that good
","I don't really understand the really positive reviews for Zombieland (2009). To be completely honest, this film just isn't worth it. The plot surrounds four characters and their journey as they travel across the country and fight off blood thirsty zombies. It stars Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, and also features a small performance by Bill Murray. The performances weren't bad i guess, it's just that the cast wasn't given all that much to work with. This is supposed to be a comedic horror, full of dark natured humor. Dark natured humor it definitely has, but good effective funny dark humor? That I'm not too sure about. I didn't really laugh at all throughout the entire film. I'm not sure if it's just not my cup of tea or what but I really didn't think the dialogue or any of the content was funny. I've seen great comedies, but this for sure is not one of them. It's not a completely terrible film, because it does feature things like a good performance by Woody Harrelson and well done special effects. Other than that though, out of luck. 4/10.",4,1,6,4 April 2018
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Fun feuding spouses spy film
","Mr and Mrs Smith is a fun energetic action movie that revolves around a married couple of 5 years. John and Jane Smith are really both spies but neither of them knows that the other is a spy, they both keep that part of their lives completely secret. I was happy with the casting of Brad Pitt as John and with Angelina Jolie as Jane. They had good on screen chemistry, both when it was supposed to be romantic and when it was them going at it trying to kill one another. It makes sense that the chemistry was so good once the news of affair broke. Poor Jennifer Aniston.... Back to the movie. The action scenes are very well done, they have everything you could ever ask for from an action film. The love scenes are well done too, well lit, and a mix between being hot and romantic. The writing accomplishes what the film wanted to accomplish. And in my opinion that's all you can really ask for. I mean sure the movie could've been better, and I've seen better more entertaining action films with romantic leads. But overall not every movie is gonna knock it out of the ballpark, and truth be told I didn't expect this one to do that. Since I didn't have really high expectations going in, I was overall pretty satisfied. 7/10 for Mr and Mrs Smith.",7,0,4,14 May 2017
Psycho," I don't get it, it wasn't that great
","I know this is a classic, and I'm sure back in it's day it was revolutionary, but to me now, it did not impress me. The only part that i really liked, was the historical shower scene! Personally, I thought the birds was a lot better. This just sent me into a state of boredom! I couldn't wait for it to end, Janet Leigh was the best part, and she died early on! Also, I liked the while twist about the mother, but those are the only things that I really like about it. Like I said it is outdated and Older, so I'll cut it some slack. I do think that the acting was really good in it! I just wish that the movie itself would've kept up with the good acting. I do think Hitchcock has done a lot better than this! Examples: Vertigo, The Birds, Marnie, all better than this, in my opinion.",4,2,8,9 March 2015
The Witch," Work like this takes true talent
","Let's travel back in time.... way back to the time of the settlers. Things were very different back then. Religion had a much stronger presence in society. Along with that, you had rampant paranoia of witchcraft. These two historical facts play a big role in the core plot of The Witch.The plot focuses on a family that has just been banned from a village. With nowhere else to go, they travel outside of the village and try to make it on their own. They start growing their own harvest, each member of the family doing their part in the work. They rely heavily on their very intense Christian faith. Unfortunately for them, weird things start to happen.... starting with the children. Soon it becomes clear that supernatural forces are at work around them. The only question is.... who is to blame? Paranoia plays a role here, so much so that it eventually leads everything to a breaking point. The acting in this film is some of the finest you'll see. The performances given scream talent, you can really tell that this cast was passionate about their roles. Anya Taylor-Joy blew me away as Thomasin, she really captured the emotion and depth necessary to play the role. Kate Dickie is also great here, she plays Katherine, the distraught mother. Dickie throws herself into this role and delivers a truly captivating performance. Lastly, is Ralph Ineson, who plays the extremely devout Christian father. I loved him in this role! He totally nailed it as William, portraying a confused, angry father trying desperately to understand what's happening to his family.I absolutely adore the score in this film. It's so unsettling and sets the perfect tone. That along with environment and visuals create a very chilling watching experience. What I love about films released by A24, is that they are all so raw and disturbingly realistic. If you want real horror and it's an A24 horror film, you're almost guaranteed quality. The ending is another great asset this film carries, it ends in the most chilling and unsettling way. I refuse to spoil anything, you'll just have to see for yourself. 9/10 for The With.",9,2,4,4 August 2018
Rosemary's Baby," Unsettling, creepy classic horror film
","Rosemary's Baby (1968) is one of the most famous horror films ever made. It got excellent unanimously positive reviews when it was released. It received those excellent reviews because it really is a great well done horror film that will creep the hell out of you. The cast includes: Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Charles Grodin, and Ruth Gordon. The performances are marvelous all around, especially by Farrow (Rosemary). Farrow plays the lead role wonderfully. Rosemary goes through a lot in the film and Farrow plays it all so well. Her character starts out as a normal wife. Her and her husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move into a new apartment and there are many creepy, eerie neighbors around them. They befriend one couple in their 70s and they form a relationship. Rosemary becomes pregnant soon after, but as the pregnancy progresses, complications come up and Rosemary begins to realize that something is deeply wrong and that the people around her might be in on it. She comes to believe that her neighbors are Satan worshipers and that her husband Guy has promised them their baby to use in rituals. It's not until the end that the truth about everything is revealed. This movie uses real effective scare tactics instead of relying on blood and gore like other horror movies. The direction is wonderfully done, the writing is very smart and well written, the performances are spot on from the entire cast, and the ending is one of the most chilling and effective ending I've ever seen! I 100% recommend this classic if you like chilling scary movies. 9/10!",9,4,7,8 August 2017
The Holiday," Found no fault at all
","The Holiday (2006) is an out of the ballpark smash hit! I thought about it after seeing it and just seriously could find NO fault whatsoever. This is such a feel good, cute, romantic, and sweet film. And it's not one of those stupid run of the mill romance movies, it actually has depth and is well made. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz are two women recently out of relationships with men, and pretty fed up with life in general, so they decide to go on vacation. They switch houses, Cameron goes to stay in England in Kate's house, and Kate goes to Los Angeles to stay in Cameron's house. The plot in and of itself is interesting and draws you in to keep watching. The script is well written and original, with little sparks of comedy thrown in where needed. And then there are scenes where we get to know our characters, usually through deep conversations with them and other characters. There definitely are NOT cardboard cut out one dimensional characters here, they are characters with real life issues, true depth, and interesting backgrounds. The romance and chemistry between the couples is great! It's truly eclectic and comes so wonderfully natural. I also love the side plot between Kate Winslet and the older screenwriter next door neighbor, it's so undeniably cute and so sweet, it's just endearing, I actually cried during the scene where he is honored at that ceremony! 10/10 for The Holiday! It's so well deserved!",10,8,9,10 June 2016
12 Years a Slave," A very well acted film
","12 years a Slave (2013) is an extremely well acted and graphically realistic slave movie. The acting in this film is just marvelous, I could not get enough of the fantastic actors portraying their roles beautifully. Chiwatel, Brad Pitt, and Lupita Nyongo, and Michael Fassbender all do marvelously and are so Oscar worthy. I also love how they didn't shy away from being graphic and realistic, because a film like this needs to be graphic and violent in order to portray the realistic quality. They also didn't shy away from showing some sex scenes and some pretty graphic nudity, which once again is very necessary in order to be true to how it really was back in slave times. This movie did go a little bit too slow I think, I do think that a couple of scenes drug on a little bit too much. But that was just a minor issue that I had with it, it was minor because the fantastic acting and the great visuals overshadowed it. Keep in mind that this movie is NOT for the weak stomached people or people that become queezy easily. The script is pretty good too, I was pretty impressed with it. 8/10 for 12 years a slave. Oh and btw happy birthday Brad Pitt!! ðŸ˜˜",8,0,1,18 December 2015

","30 Days of Night (2007) is a Josh Hartnett, Melissa George vampire movie. These two lead actors play a separated couple who must come together for the good of the townspeople around them when their Alaska town gets attacked by vampires. I liked these two talented actors in their roles, they fit them well in my opinion. The plot is pretty average and by the numbers for a movie like this, although some of the ways in which they execute that plot is different. I will not spoil anything in this review, but just suffice to say that there are some things that happen, especially towards the end, that do not typically happen in other movies similar to this. I appreciated that. The action is good most of the time, and I liked that this movie didn't completely rely on shock and gore, movies that do that are very weak. Overall, this is one that i mildly recommend, there's better in the genre, but it's certainly not a bad pick by any means. 7/10 for 30 Days of Night.",7,0,0,22 December 2017
Sausage Party," Never seen anything like this before....
","Prepare thyself. Sausage Party is unlike anything anyone has ever seen. This animated comedy is HARD R rated. By far the most explicit adult animation ever made. So please if you're going to watch then don't allow the children to be in on it. The movie starts off at a supermarket where we see all kinds of food items singing a song praising the 'gods' (humans), because they believe the 'gods' are good and nice and will give them everything they've ever dreamed of in 'the great beyond'. They all believe that 'the great beyond' is when humans purchase them and bring them home with them. They soon find out though that this fantasy is completely false. The main characters are Frank the sausage (Seth Rogen) and Brenda the Bun (Kristen Wiig). They are in love and I liked wiig and rogen voicing them, good casting. All the hot dog wieners want to 'fill' the hot dog buns in the great beyond. Fancy way of saying they want to have sex and lots of it. The comedy in the film is pretty hit and miss lots of the time. The movie is 1 hour and 20 minutes and I laughed three times. That is why I say it's hit and miss. The majority of the comedy stems from extremely crass/crude material, and very sexually explicit material as well. Sexual jokes and potty humor abounds. And so does profanity. F**k, s**t, c**k, c**t, absolutely nothing is left unused as far as cursing goes, so just be prepared and know that that's what you're in for with Sausage Party. I didn't mind the cursing at all, I never really do with any movie, although I did mind the unoriginality to a lot of the comedy. A lot of the comedy is just very middle school, I think a lot of the times the writers just injected extreme cursing to get laughs. And that just wasn't very funny. I liked the characters and I thought the movie was funny a few times. Another thing I liked was how they handled the plot, it was surprisingly thought provoking. It's all about questioning what you've been fed as far as religion goes, actually looking into things for yourself, not just believing something blindly. And that's a good lesson. But then.... after a good message at its heart is displayed, there's a full fledged food orgy. Complete with thrusting, moaning, masturbation, BDSM, oral sex, and other stuff.... With all of this considered I give Sausage Party a 6/10. A few funny moments and some good characters, but there are better options.",6,2,3,13 April 2017
Burlesque," Excellent, sexy, electrifying film
","Burlesque achieved absolute greatness! I am a huge Cher fan, so naturally I just had to see this movie. Cher blew it away here, not only with her magnificent voice, but also with her acting! I saw where Cher was nominated for a Razzie for this film........ I don't know what those Razzie people were on when they decided that, or maybe they just didn't watch the movie, that's probably it! I didn't know a thing about Christina Aguilara before this movie, and now I can say I am a big fan! Her acting was spot on, her dancing was very sexy and exciting! Every burlesque dancer was unbelievably great and always spot on with their performances! Stanley Tucci handled his character wonderfully. I loved how they showed Tess's relationship with Sean, a very sweet and close friendship. And then there's Cam, I LOVED his character! There couldn't have been a better love interest! He was very sweet, friendly, warm and above all---sexy!! As the main love interest should be! The music was so electrifying! The dance moves were perfect! The whole film was just soo entertaining and enjoyable! Get your ass up, show me how you Burlesque! ;)",9,2,2,6 June 2015
Scream 2," Slightly better than the first
","Scream 2 is slightly better than the first scream, I did enjoy the first movie, but I enjoyed this one more. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox are still just as good as they were in the first movie, their characters haven't changed all that much. You know they say that sequels to movies, especially to scary movies, are usually pretty horrible, but that's just not the case with this film, you get the feeling that they actually tried and put some effort into this one and didn't just phone in another cheesy slasher romp. Some of the scares are the traditional jump scares and usuals that everyone is used to, but they are still pretty fresh and they work. The acting is good and I enjoyed the performances. The gore factor isn't as much present as it was in the first one, but it's still very much there, so just be aware that that's there, in case you're someone who gets squeamish easily or just hates seeing blood. The plot is what you would expect, but with a few twists and turns that you probably won't see coming, at least I didn't, but maybe you're more attentive than I am lol. I personally really enjoyed those plot twists, I thought they were clever and well done. The writing is pretty average for this kind of film, it's similar to the first. Oh and you also get to see some of Sarah Michelle Gellar, she racked up the horror in '97 (I know what you did last summer). 8/10.",8,0,1,30 March 2017
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A Beautiful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel.
","Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is a visually stunning film, that's what got me interested in watching it. The release poster for this movie is soo beautiful and intriguing! This movie is filled with a winning cast all around! Anthony Hopkins was great as usual, and so was Winona Ryder, who gave a very convincing performance as Mina. I know it was heavily criticized, but I rather liked Keanu Reeves in this film, I thought he made his character very likable and also very convincing! The Costume Design is one of the greatest costume designs in any film period. The time period dresses, armor, suits and robes fit soo well in this movie! The sets were so amazing to look at, especially when it came to Dracula's castle! Well deserved Oscars! I adored Dracula's brides here, the way they behaved, presented themselves, the manner in which they spoke, all of these aspects were cranked up in their portrayal of these three evil wives of Dracula, especially in the scene where all 3 seduce Jonathan Harker. I'm glad that scene was in the film, it really shows and reveals the true nature of Dracula's wives, and I just love the way they handled themselves, with fangs, a smile, the elaborate costumes, and with a very very sensual manner, which is an integral point of his wives. There were a few awkward moments as far as acting, but overall, very good! I also really embraced the beginning story of how Dracula became himself by losing his beloved. And the ending was actually and surprisingly very touching, and I'm glad it was, nice to see Dracula have some real emotions and feel love like a human. Francis ford Coppola is an amazing filmmaker, and hopefully, his daughter will continue the good work. 8/10",8,0,3,11 May 2015
August Rush," Lovely modern day fairytale like story
","August Rush (2007) is like a modern day fairytale. The movie is one to be enjoyed and it's meant to enchant it's audience. The plot centers around a young orphan boy who is a musical prodigy. He is on a mission to find his parents, with whom he has never meet. His mother (Keri Russell) is a musician who went to Juliard, she went to a party one night with a girlfriend of hers and ended up having sex with a male band member. She got pregnant as a result of that tryst. She was hit by a car and rushed to the hospital, her very controlling father forged her signature and put the baby up for adoption and told her when she awoke that she'd lost the baby. She doesn't contact the father or anything and they all go their separate ways. About 11 years later, the son is on a search for his parents, claiming he can sense them and he follows the music. The movie really takes off when he is searching for his parents and they are searching for each other too. That's where the fairytale part of the film kicks in. The acting is good for the most part. I really loved Jonathan Rhys Meyers in his role, very good casting decision. Russell was good as Lyla, the mother. And I loved Freddie Highmore as August Rush. He is such a great actor, especially for him to be that young. Robin Williams is good here too, he plays the antagonist, a kind of role he didn't usually play. This movie is just enchanting and I loved it! The writing isn't like Oscar worthy or anything but it's a very well made movie that'll keep your undivided attention the entire way through and will leave you feeling great. 10/10!",10,0,0,11 December 2017
The Green Mile," Powerful, captivating, and very moving story
","The Green Mile (1999) is a film that will send you on a roller coaster of emotions. Tom Hanks is great here, this actually may be my favorite film of his. But really no one can deny who the true star of this movie is. That is without a doubt Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan is absolutely fantastic here, blew me AWAY! I was sobbing like a baby because he truly brings the events of this movie to life in a way that touches you in a special way. That is one reason this film is on IMDb's top 100 list. Another big reason is the script/writing, the writing is worthy of every single award ever, expect the Razzies of course. The dialogue between the characters is so important and crucial in a film like this, and it more than delivers on that aspect. Come to think of it, I cannot think of one single thing that this movie didn't deliver 110% on. And boy is that rare! 10/10 for The Green Mile. I encourage everyone who is old enough to understand the complexity of the film to give it a good watch. You will not disappointed, trust me.",10,0,1,7 March 2017
The Reader," Very well done film
","The Reader (2008) is a very interesting film, unlike any other I've seen. The story focuses on Michael Berg, played by Ralph Fiennes and David Kross (younger Michael). It's about him and Kate Winslet's character, Hanna. When Michael was 15, he meet Hanna and they began an affair, an affair that consisted of sex and reading. Michael would read to Hanna and then they would make love. They did this for a summer and then Hanna left. A few years later, Michael was in law school and was witnessing a trial, a trial that involved Hanna. We learn things about her past through this trial. One thing that I absolutely love about this film, is the acting. The acting is so unbelievably great, especially on Winslet's part, who I believe is one of the greatest actresses Hollywood has ever seen. She delivers such a deeply raw performance, we as the audience feel everything she feels, the same goes for Fiennes and Kross. I just want to give special recognition to Kross, because I absolutely adored him here! Even as a young actor, he gives a very skilled performance. I also liked the writing, it's very well done. I like that, through the writing, we get to know these characters. Overall, it's a very intelligent film and it's recommended",9,1,1,4 March 2018
Jaws," Well made classic
","Who hasn't seen or at the very least heard of the classic 1970's film, Jaws?? It's so well known and won three Academy Awards for it's fine filmmaking. The plot of course revolves around the humongous shark that is terrorizing the small coastal town of Amity. The characters that the film focuses on is Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss. They are the men that ultimately end up going up against this beast of the water. There are certain things I liked about this one. One of those things is the casting, I thought the actors did a good job with the material.The writing is also well done, the dialogue is important, because most of it is about the shark and determining what's to be done about it. But if I'm being honest, my favorite part of the film is the atmospheric aspect of it all. The atmosphere plays a big role in the effectiveness. The atmosphere and the music are probably the two most memorable and important parts of Jaws. The opening sequence combines those two things perfectly! The film is fun, exciting, and overall well made. I'll admit that I don't love it to the extent that most probably do. It's not on my favorites list, but it's still good. 8/10 for Jaws.",8,2,3,31 March 2018
Dark Shadows," Umm.....
","Dark shadows is just absolutely terrible, it is muddled, BORING, poorly acted to be honest, and a complete waste of talent. Tim Burton is obviously a very talented actor, so I don't know what kinda whacked up stuff he was on when he did this movie, but even if he was that's still no excuse for delivering this trash to us. I'm not a humongous Depp fan, but he has been good in previous films, he was NOT in this one, he is annoying and way too over the top here. This film is not funny, when it tries to get out a laugh, it falls flat every time. Helena carter is lazy and lackluster here too. And I usually like Michelle Pfeiffer, but come on Michelle, you deserve better material than this! The events are boring and the plot i.e. uninteresting and the script is very lazy and phoned in. 1/10.",1,2,4,22 March 2016
Hitch," Funny, cute romantic comedy
","Will Smith's 2005 romantic comedy Hitch is cute and at times pretty funny. I enjoyed smith's performance, he is perfect for the lead role, funny when he needs to be and charming when it calls for it. Eva Mendes is great here too, I loved the way she approached the role, you can tell she is pretty resistant to love and a potential relationship, she has become very bitter and closed off to the notion of a long term relationship. But of course that all changes when she meets hitch (will smith). Kevin James is funny as always, love his dancing here, that was a really cute/funny thing because yes it's amusing but it also ended up a thing that Allegra was attracted to, and that among other things makes their relationship work. Amber Valletta plays her role nicely and I think that her and James's on screen chemistry works very well, they just have a natural likability to them as a couple. The same thing goes for Mendes and Smith. So yes some parts are predictable and some of it is just run of the mill romantic comedy style content that you've seen before, but I think that even though it has some predictability, it is still a very funny and entertaining film that deserves a watch, especially if you're a fan of the cast or a big rom com fan. 8/10.",8,0,1,24 March 2017
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Mirror mirror on the wall.......
","Disney's first feature film!! Hard to believe this thing was released in 1937 when my grandparents were just toddlers. This classic is of course the story of princess Snow White, the FAIREST in the land, and her being on the run from the evil queen who desires to be the fairest in the land. She plots to kill Snow White so that she can be the fairest, but as in all Disney animated classic, good will always win, and there's a handsome prince to help. This classic fairytale still holds up today, it's great animation, ESPECIALLY for 1937! It's very fun and entertaining, complete with catchy songs and well written characters like the dwarfs. The dwarfs are: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey. They all of course behave exactly like their name and they work in a nearby mine, they stroll in single file every day singing their work song, hi ho hi ho..... Snow White stumbles upon them and their cottage and she begins to stay there with her while in hiding from the evil queen. The evil queen, who is a FANTASTIC Disney villain all the while is plotting a way to kill Snow White. I love the scene where she creates an elixir that will transform her into an ugly old hag so that snow will not recognize her as she offers a poisoned apple. One of the best scenes in animated movies if you ask me. Overall everyone knows about this Disney classic and if you or your family have not seen it then what are you waiting for lol. I highly suggest watching if you if you have younger children because they will LOVE it! Perfect for a family movie night with young kids. 9/10.",9,2,2,26 April 2017
The Lion King," Snores!!!!
","There are a million other Disney movies that are sooo much better than this one! This movie is just boring all throughout. Also,i felt it was too scary for children. It made my little cousins cry. The songs were bad in my opinion. I hated every character, and i really didn't care what happened to them, really i just wanted this movie to end! Disney is capable of so much more, which I saw in 2015 Cinderella! That Beats out this any day of the week. There just wasn't anything for me in this movie, very bland and boring. I really don't know what else to say about it, it was bland and poor! I'm giving The Lion King a 3/10 for being a poor attempt at a family film by Disney.",3,2,6,20 April 2015
Murder on the Orient Express," Pretty good remake of an Agatha Christie classic
","This is an updated version of the 1970s film version of the Agatha Christie novel. Most people recognize the name Agatha Christie, famous novelist. Christie wrote mystery novels, very good at that. Her body of work consists of things like murder on the orient express, and then there were none (also made into a film), the ABC murders.... plus more. I saw the 1970s film when I was probably too young to see it, but remember it being intriguing and having a very unexpected ending. I will say that for this remake, both of those things still hold true. There are intriguing parts of this movie, and it has an unexpected ending that I really liked and I thought was cleverly done. OK so let's talk about the plot and how it was executed. The plot isn't all too original at first glance. There are a number of passengers on a train, none that having any relation to one another, among them is one of the most famous detectives in existence... and one night the train suddenly stops. They check one of the passengers rooms and discover he's been murdered, stabbed. Immediately, this detective goes to work at trying to discover just who might've had an alibi, but what he discovers really thickens the plot. I won't say what he discovers, just that it makes the film much more interesting and really makes your ears perk up. The acting was well done mostly. I loved Michelle Pfeiffer in her role, Penelope Cruz was good in hers, Johnny Depp fit his well, Judi Dench was impressive as always, and Kenneth Branagh was just perfect for the starring role as Hercule Poirot. The dialogue was good for the most part, there were a few parts where things got a bit dull, and my attention did wander a couple times. That is really the only reason the rating isn't higher than it is. All in all though, it is a pretty good film that will entertain most people who are fans of this kind of movie. 7/10 for Murder on the Orient Express.",7,8,21,13 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," All around well done film
","This certainly is a more 'out there' version of Sherlock Holmes, but I can day with conviction that I really loved this version. Robert Downey Jr. is great as the lead and Jude Law is fitting in the supporting role of Watson. Also in the supporting role category is Rachel Mcadams, and she is very good too. The movie will grab you right from the beginning, with it showing a man performing what appears to be a Satanic ritual, with a woman writhing and under the influence of whatever magic he is performing. I don't know about you, but when I see something like that in a movie, I wanna stick around to find out more. The action sequences are well done, some are actually in slow motion as Holmes explains exactly how he will beat up this person he is fighting, and then he does it in regular motion, which was cool to see. The mystery to the movie is good, no humongous twists here, but still the film is entertaining as anyone could ask for, and it will certainly keep ones attention. The acting is just so good all around by everyone in the cast too. Guy Ritchie directs the film beautifully, which I commend him for. I encourage you to go see Sherlock Holmes, I can guarantee that you will not regret it. Can't wait to see a game of shadows! 8/10.",8,0,1,10 December 2016
Finding Dory," Better than the original
","Finding Dory (2016) is even better then the original film, Finding Nemo. This movie is just fun and OMG it is so heartwarming! I cried more than once while watching it. Ellen of of course is still awesome as Dory, and her parents were so great! Diane Keaton was great as Dory's mom, perfect choice for her mother, and Eugene levy is good too. The comedy here is even better than in the first movie, there are definitely moments of pure hilarity. Along with those funny moments, are the scenes that are heart warming and beautiful. The dialogue here is spot on and it just goes to show the talent of the writer for this film. The adventures and different obstacles that Dory, Nemo and Marlin go through to find dorys parents are fun, engaging, and well done. It's tough to find a sequel that surpasses the original, it just simply does not happen a whole lot, but here, in my opinion, this one did surpass the original. Don't get me wrong, I love finding nemo, but finding dory is just better I think. 9/10 for Finding Dory, this is the perfect family film to go and enjoy, suitable for all ages really. And there is a great positive message to go with this movie. Part of that message is revealed in the credits. 'This film is for all families - every kind'. That is so awesome, and it teaches children that all types of families are good and loving, and that we don't all have to be the same. So go and have some fun with Finding Dory!",9,3,12,26 June 2016
Arrival," One of the best I've seen in a while
","Arrival is the latest alien movie to be released, and it completely avoids clichés, which is a good thing. Instead of relying on science fiction cliché and formula, it tells a very original story about a linguistics professor (Amy Adams) and a scientist (Jeremy Renner) who interact with these aliens that have landed in 12 different spacecrafts all around the world. The movie is very well written and the acting is superb on the part of Adams, Renner, and Whitaker. The effects here are great, the aliens look very interesting and I loved the way they designed the spaceships. I especially liked how the aliens communicated, their language and how Adams worked to decode it will really keep your attention. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, you will still walk away loving this film because it's just a very well made film that makes you think. The last thing Arrival is is generic, it's very intriguing and thought provoking. Go and see this wonderfully entertaining film! 9/10 for Arrival!",9,6,16,16 December 2016
The Terminal," A classic in my book
","The Terminal is a classic film, a very unique one. I say that it is unique because I truly can't think of a another film like it. The plot revolves around Tom Hanks's character, a foreign man traveling from a country that is in ruins and now he cannot go back to his country because it no longer exists, but the airport can't let him go into America either, so he has no choice but to stay in the terminal. Stanley Tucci plays the man working at the airport who is basically in charge. He quickly becomes the antagonist in the film, and he plays that role well, Tucci has flexed his acting muscle in other great movies such as Devil wears prada, Julie and Julia, and more, and this one is no exception. Hanks ofcourse shines in the lead role, as he always does, I remember being amazed at the accent and how great he nails it, I also love how he portrayed Victor, his character. Hanks plays Victor with a lovability that's just undeniable. That lovability is crucial for this character, it must be expressed through him in order for the entire film to work in the way it's supposed to be. Then there's Catherine Zeta Jones. I absolutely love her and her character in this film. She plays a fight attendant that frequently comes to the airport that Victor is at, and he develops feelings for her. They have great chemistry together and I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen when they are together. Theirs isn't a grand epic love story, but it's a very sweet endearing one, and it works perfectly for the movie. The writing really is great and I love it has some comedy and sweet, touching moments. It's very balanced, and it makes for a great film.",9,0,0,16 February 2018
Music and Lyrics," Entertaining enough
","Music and Lyrics is an entertaining, sweet romantic comedy. Drew Barrymore is a very good actress for this particular role. And I loved Hugh grant playing opposite Barrymore. The romantic chemistry between them is great, starts out as just friends working on music together, but of course their connection turns into a romantic relationship. I also really loved Kristen Johnston in her supporting role. She was actually one of my very favorite parts of the whole film. She is just absolutely hilarious. I loved the comedic lines the script provided her with, and the way she delivered them was done with great timing. That's one thing I love about the script for this movie, it provides it's actors with effective comedic lines. I loved the Buddhist Britney Spears like pop star in the film, she gave a lot of good material for comedy, she wasn't all that funny herself, but like I said, she gave funny material to other characters, how people reacted to what she did was the real comedy. All in all, this rom com is humorous, especially if you were alive and can remember the 1980s. I of course was not, but I still found it funny. It's just that you will probably be able to relate more effectively to everything if you were in the 80s. 7/10",7,0,0,8 April 2017
The Conjuring," Well made horror film
","The Conjuring is a well filmed, well acted, and yes, a well written film. Vera Faminga and Patrick Wilson have fantastic chemistry in this movie, and they acted very well here, they should be very proud of their performances. I love the visuals in this movie, the visuals really are high quality! Also, Lili Taylor was great here, she was a great casting decision, the casting all around in the conjuring is spot on. James Wan did a great job directing this film! The scares here aren't as scary as I thought it would be, which was slightly disappointing, but there still were some good scares none the less. The exorcism scene really was great! Scary/creepy visuals run rampant through that scene, which was how it was supposed to be! Overall, this film was a pretty well made film, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but that doesn't mean it was bad. 7/10 for The Conjuring.",7,1,2,6 February 2016
Scream," 2 and 4 are better in my opinion
","Scream is a pretty entertaining slasher film, but I think that scream 2 and 4 are better. The whole feel of this film is fairly fresh. Fresh meaning that it's not completely forgettable like a whole of past slasher horror movies. This movie is not comedic, but it is slightly satirical at times, it knows the horror movie clichés, and it plays off them and kind of makes fun of them. There are lines of dialogue among high school teens about the rules of 'surviving a horror movie', and of course they're all the obvious cheesy things that teens in old slashers do. It is neat to see a movie that does poke a little fun at itself, but not in an outright comedic way, it still is very much a serious horror. The cast did a fine job with their roles. Neve Campbell does a good job with the starring role of Sidney. Sidney is a pretty tortured teenage girl who has recently lost her mother. And Courtney Cox (Friends) is a journalist/reporter who is writing a book on the murder case of Sidney's mother and is also trying to interview Sidney everywhere she goes. The plot isn't too complicated, crazy killer on the loose and you don't know who it is and people are dropping like flies. The goriness in the movie is in some scenes necessary and in others not so much. The ending is pretty thrilling and I enjoyed that, I also really liked the very beginning scene, Drew Barrymore does well with her 5 minutes of recognition lol. It was a good scene to open the whole thing with. Set the tone.",7,0,0,29 March 2017
Prometheus," A truly magnificent piece of work
","Prometheus really is a magnificent piece of film. Taking place in the same world and universe as the Alien movies, this movie serves as a prequel to the first 1979 film. It tackles issues like the suppose it origin of mankind and aliens. The crew that board the Prometheus go to this planet to try to discover the origin of mankind, they do find what they came for, but in a much darker and more twisted version than they expected. One thing I would like to say is that the special effects in this film are absolutely magnificent, I mean they are truly some of the best I've ever seen! It really did deserve that Academy Award nomination for best visual effects. And the cast does a great job at portraying their characters, this movie does have a star-studded cast including Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace and Idris Elba. Also the 'engineers' in this movie (the people and they believe created them) are very cool/interesting looking, and I love the way that the filmmakers made them look, so real and very life like. And you know the actual alien, like in the 1979 film, doesn't really have a huge presence here, it's more about these 'engineers' than anything, although don't get me wrong, aliens do make several appearances here. But you know that's one of the things that excited me most about Prometheus, this whole prequel idea about where did we come from, and you know the movie doesn't leave you with all the answers, but it does give you just enough to satisfy and to keep your interest, because we do know that these engineers that are shown in the movie created us but we don't know their motives behind wanting to terminate us. So go ahead and rent Prometheus and just have a great time, this is truly a magnificent film that just about anyone can enjoy because it's so well acted well-made and intriguing. 9/10!",9,3,7,6 July 2016
Halloween," I wanted to like it more than I actually did
","Halloween (1978) starring Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously a huge hit and is beloved by horror movie fans around the globe. I really did want to like this movie, but I just didn't like it all that much. OK, my big problem with it, is it just kinda dragged along at the beginning, i felt like it took way too long to get going. So because of that, I became sort of bored at the beginning. Now, I did enjoy Jamie's strong performance as Laurie Strode, the main victim. And I liked the other actor's performances, pretty good acting in this movie. Once the killings started, it started getting better, and I became interested in the film. The movie had a good script and pretty well written dialogue. Was it scary?? Well...... Sort of/not really. Halloween had it's scares at times, but overall not all that scary. 6/10 for Halloween (1978). Now let's see how the rob zombie remake is. I will probably be seeing/reviewing that one next.",6,0,4,23 December 2015
Wonder Woman," Very entertaining Marvel film
","Wonder Woman finally has a feature film in the DC universe. And it's Gal Gadot playing the infamous bad ass hero. I really loved her as Wonder Woman, she plays the character not only with a tough heroic persona, but also with a very strong sense of heart and morality. She brings depth and empathy to the role, which is of course very much needed. Chris Pine stars alongside Gadot, and I can't think of a better actor to play Pine's character. He is the love interest of Wonder Woman, a soldier she meets at the beginning. He is of course an extremely good looking man, but he brings more than just a rugged handsome face to the role, he also brings emotion and depth and his chemistry with Gadot is very believable and the audience is automatically pulled into their story. Their connection really en-chances the movie overall. Diana (Wonder Woman) and her personal growth in the movie is also a big part of the plot. We see her grow and discover things about herself and the world, we see her connection with Pine and where that goes, and then of course we get to see a lot of cool action sequences, especially towards the end when the true enemy is revealed. I give Wonder Woman an 8/10 overall, pretty entertaining well made superhero flick.",8,6,11,2 September 2017
The Woman in Black," HORRIFYING horror movie
","The woman in black is a truly terrifying film to watch. This movie definitely is not one of those run of the mill stupid cheesy horror films, this movie scared me to death in almost every scene. Daniel Radcliffe is very affective as the lead, and did very well in my opinion, he was very believable. The movies setting is very affective and has an eerie feel to it. The costume design was spot on, and so was the script! The scares are genuine and very bone chilling! They don't resort to the stupid cliché over used and ineffective jump scares. The film is also beautifully shot, it looks very slick and well directed! The storyline is very interesting and intriguing. The characters are creepy and perfect for this type of movie. The woman in black is a very eerie, frightening, and creepily effective film with very good acting. 10/10 for the woman in black.",10,0,2,28 December 2015
Mother!," Grand metaphor
","Mother! really is one giant metaphor. This film is so shocking and at times unbelievable. The trailers really make it seam like it's a scary movie, but really it's not. You could argue that it contains some scary scenes, but ultimately this is a psychological movie. The movie messes with your mind and it makes you think and analyze exactly what it's trying to say. Everything begins with Jennifer Lawrence's character waking up to her husband, Javier Bardem. They are married and living in their house that she is fixing up while he is working on a new book. Pretty soon after that, Ed Harris shows up, he is a man that claims he thought their house was a bed and breakfast and because it's late, they allow him to stay. Then, Michelle Pfeiffer, Harris's wife, shows up and she is now staying also. Lawrence's character really is pretty uncomfortable with this, especially when even more people start to show up. Things start unfolding rapidly as more and more people flood into their house. Part of me doesn't want to reveal too much because I do very much encourage people to go see this movie, it's just so exquisitely done and the metaphorical way that filmmaker Darren Aronofsky does everything is amazing. I will say that there is a definite theme to the movie, I think it's a Biblical theme personally. There seems to be a god and Mother Nature theme to it. You'll see what I'm talking about when you watch it. It could also just be symbolic of a relationship being torn apart by certain people and things that go on throughout the movie. It's ultimately up to each individual to interpret for themselves. This movie is fantastically acted, written and directed. 100% recommended. 10/10 for Mother!",10,1,6,16 November 2017
The Emperor's New Groove," Extremely underrated
","The emperor's new groove is truly an underrated Disney film. It is highly entertaining, well written and funny. The voice actors are perfect fits for their animated characters, especially Yzma. I would to take a minute to talk about the character of Yzma, she is just an awesome character, very well written, well designed, and extremely well voiced. Could there have been a better actor to voice Kronk?? Patrick Warburton is so perfect to voice Yzma's hopelessly ignorant assistant. David Spade is very fitting for the self obsessed, selfish, spoiled rotten emperor Kuzco. The story is fun, well paced, funny, and heart warming towards the end. This is one movie the whole family will surely adore. It also is a very healthy movie for children to view since it shows the before and after of Kuzco, going from being extremely selfish and materialistic to actually caring for others and becoming a nice, decent human being. I especially love the scenes that involve Yzma and kronk interacting, their characters have hilarious chemistry. I encourage everyone no matter young or old to rent or buy this the next time you see it available. 'Pull the lever Kronk. WRONG LEVER!!!!!' 10/10!",10,2,4,21 March 2017
Bruce Almighty," Drab
","Bruce almighty is just boring and bland. Jim Carrey isn't likable at all here, he is just boring and unfunny, I really did hate his character here. Morgan freeman was alright as God, he is good in theory as the almighty, but idk he was just a little blah, nothing too special. And then there's Jennifer Aniston, she was OK, I am an Aniston fan, but it's kinda hard to be a big fan of her in Bruce almighty, because like freeman, there just isn't much to her performance in the film. Also this movie is just hopelessly UNfunny, I mean I didn't even chuckle once during the entire film, and let me just tell ya, the movie is too long, the runtime is just simply too long. The movie should've been funnier, much funnier, especially since it stars comedic talent Jim Carrey, go figure. Bruce Almighty stoops to childish mediocre stunts to gain laughs, but fails miserably at it. Steve Carrel, another comedic talent, is in the movie, but he is a flop here as well. Boring, boring, and more boring. 1/10 for Bruce Almighty, just a flat out flop. Disappointing too, the movie had pretty good potential to be something funny, original, and intelligent. Maybe Evan almighty will be better, kinda doubt it though.",1,3,6,22 June 2016
The Greatest Showman," Good, not great
","20th Century Fox's The Greatest Showman is a family oriented musical based on P.T. Barnum. I have somewhat mixed feelings after seeing this tonight. I'll first go over the positive aspects of the film, then I'll cover the negative ones. First of all, I'll say that the singing is very good, the musical numbers don't disappoint for the vast majority of the time. There were moments in a couple of the big musical numbers where I felt they got a bit Disney Channel, which is not how a big screen musical should feel. It's kind of strange though because some songs, like we can rewrite the stars between Zac Efron and Zendaya, or any time Rebecca Ferguson was singing, those did not have that feel to it at all and I really enjoyed it. I thought the actors were well cast and the acting was fine, I won't say that the performances were amazing because I didn't feel that they were. I have seen better acting from all the stars in previous films they've done, but that's not to say that their were bad, they were just fine. The visuals is another thumbs up. Visually, this movie was great, if we were only talking about visuals, then this would be a ten. Now for the negatives. What I mentioned previously when talking about the singing is one of the negatives, the moments where it felt too kiddie and not like a big screen musical. Another negative is that it's just not up to par with other great musicals in cinema history. I felt that it was too safe in places, like it was content at just being good and not great. It didn't take that extra step.I left the theater feeling a sense of 'that was a decent musical, but I have definitely seen better'. I suggest this mildly, if you're looking for a family oriented musical then I's definetly say this one, but there are much better musical films out there and I think this one could have been better than just good. 7/10 for The Greatest Showman.",7,0,1,6 January 2018
Bull Durham," The religion called baseball
","Bull Durham is a comedic baseball film starring Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins. The film centers around an older baseball player and a vary talented rookie. Then, there's a woman who hooks up with a baseball player every season and kinda takes him under her wing. She does that with the rookie (Tim Robbins) this season and that's where our movie begins... The acting in this movie and the on screen chemistry between the characters is what makes this movie work. Yes, it's technically a sports movie, but it doesn't really center around baseball too much. It focuses on the characters and their relationships with one another. It really has something in it for everyone. It has really good comedy that works, some romance, sports of course, and some serious moments. There are many lines from this film that I would consider to be some of the best lines in cinema. No wonder it's writing got an academy award nomination. I really like this movie, it's just good entertainment. 8/10 for Bull Durham.",8,1,2,15 August 2017
Pitch Perfect 3," Gave me an empty feeling
","Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) is the third installment, hopefully the last of the Pitch Perfect series. Only reason that I say I hope it's the last is because once you go as low in quality as this film, it is time to stop. I am a fan of the first Pitch Perfect, I gave that film an 8, admittedly I have not seen the second installment, but I don't feel like I needed to to get this one. This film gave me a very hollow, empty feeling from start to finish. The comedy has stopped working for the most part, yes there are a few laughs, but not a lot. Also, the plot isn't that interesting and the plot delves into absolute insanity. Like it goes from regular Pitch Perfect stuff to an action/spy movie and I don't feel like it worked. If they could do this well, then I say sure go for it, but they just didn't. The characters are the same, but they've just been placed in a bad film, and that's sad because you want the final film in a series to be good. I am sorry to say that Pitch Perfect only gets a 4.",4,8,12,11 July 2018
Identity," A very well put together psychological thriller!
","Identity (2003) is a very smart, well made, and shocking psychological thriller. The acting performances are very good! The dialogue/script was well written. The plot twists are extremely eye opening and well put together, the plot twists absolutely MADE this movie!! It wouldn't be the same without the twists. This movie got very well deserved good reviews from critics and audiences, it is one of my absolute favorites! The actors really embodied their roles and were perfect fits for them. I 110% recommend this film to anyone and everyone who enjoys these types of movies! Identity (2003) is just an all around great film that's well directed, acted, and especially well written! I will not reveal the big plot twists, but I will say this, go watch and find out for yourself! Seriously you will not be disappointed I'm sure. 10/10",10,0,0,4 November 2015
Fantastic Mr. Fox," One of the best animated films I've ever seen
","I absolutely love Fantastic Mr. Fox! It's an excellent animated movie. From the clever comedic writing to the great casting for the voices of the characters to the masterful animation technique. Meryl Streep, George Clooney, and Bill Murray's voices all match up with their characters very well, it just works. The writing is a very dry humor, it's not obvious at all, which is the kind of humor I love, some very young children may not quite understand all the lines and the comedy in them since it's not obvious humor, but older kids and adults certainly will. I don't get to see this kind of animation a lot, but I'm so glad this well made film used this kind because it's very fascinating to look at. The film switches between the animals and what they're doing to the humans and what they are plotting to do about the animals. Young children will like the action related scenes, and the older kids/adults will love the dialogue exchanges and the clever script. 10/10 for Fantastic Mr. Fox! Flawless animated film.",10,0,0,12 March 2017
Speed," Absolutely brilliant!
","Speed is an excellent action movie! It's in my top 3 favorite action movies of all time, it has everything a great action movie needs: a good script, good acting, great exciting action sequences, and a good atmosphere. Speed has such a unique and cool plot to begin with, it's very creative and edge of your seat thrilling. Keanu Reeves was great in the lead! He took control and was very high energy throughout the whole thing, but then he also had the range to change from that to a nice warm hearted sweet guy, which I loved. Sandra Bullock was amazing here! This is one of her best performances In my personal opinion. And then there is Dennis hopper, no other guy could've pulled off the powerful performance that Dennis gave. He was so menacing and purely evil, which he needed to be. The dialogue was impactful and fitting, script was very well written. The action sequences were very edge of your seat and thrilling! That certainly kept you guessing the whole way through, and the visuals here are well constructed and cool to see. The ending is also very exciting and pleasing, it doesn't disappoint. The final line of the film is so great, it's happy and comedic/romantic, which was very fitting. 10/10!",10,1,3,15 February 2016
RED," Great movie!!
","RED (retired extremely dangerous) (2010) is a very entertaining and thrilling action film. Helen Mirren was by far my favorite character in this movie! She was great in this movie, so slick and cool!! And of course Bruce Willis is great in here, such a great action hero, as he is in most movies. Mary Louise Parker and Morgan Freeman were great as well, all the characters in RED are so well constructed and cool to see. The script for this movie is well written and has just the right amount of action and comedy mixed in. The director really did a great job with the action sequences, they were very slick and fun to watch. The visuals and the whole look of the movie is very good too, and I loved the costume design as well. Overall, the bottom line is that RED is just a cool, fun time for all to see! There is also very funny dialogue between the characters, Marty Louise Parker's character is especially funny. I really loved her character! 10/10 for RED! Love it every time, never gets old.",10,4,5,29 December 2015
The Purge," Entertaining, interesting movie
","The Purge is a very interesting and definitely a unique/original movie. The cast is really well selected, Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are both great in their roles, they were very intense and could be really bad ass when they needed to be. I love the entire concept of this movie's plot, one night where all crime INCLUDING MURDER is completely legal, very original. This film started out well, just by introducing the family and seeing how they live. Then the movie drags just a bit in the middle, but don't worry because it does rev back up pretty quickly. The last 35 minutes of the purge are by far the best! There is lots of tense scenes, rough fighting, a little twist, and a really good ending in my opinion. This movie isn't like a horror masterpiece, but it sure is a good interesting movie to sit and enjoy one Friday or Saturday night. 7/10 for the purge.",7,0,1,7 February 2016
Pitch Perfect," Great fun!
","Pitch Perfect (2012) is an example of a movie that exists for the sole purpose of entertaining an audience in a really fun way. Almost all movies are meant to entertain in some way, but they differ in how they go about it. Some try to teach lessons and send important messages, where as others are there to make you laugh and feel good, Pitch Perfect is one of the latter. It's not limited to a teenage/young adult audience, but that is the main target audience, and I believe that it's one of the best young adult movies we've seen in a while. It's not just thrown together like a sloppy mess, it's actually very well done. The casting is near perfection, especially Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Skylar Astin who are the spirit of the movie in my opinion. The other actors do a great job too, but I thought those three just really shined the brightest. Elizabeth Banks and is hilarious too. The writing is smart, entertaining, and has a funny-sweet tone that really works. I highly suggest this movie for everyone!",8,1,1,29 March 2018
Casino," An absolutely incredible film!
","Casino (1995) is hands down one of the best films I've ever seen in my entire life. I say that because honestly, there just aren't many films that are this well done, it's pretty rare to find a gem like this one. Now, some may not care for it simply because it's just not their cup of tea, but nonetheless it's still a great film. The writing is really perfect for the kind of film it is. A record of the most F bombs ever spoken in a film was set by Casino, before Wolf of Wall Street came along that is. I would probably say the 400+ F bombs used was overkill if it would have been a different kind of film, but it fit perfectly for this kind. The writing definitely fits the characters. The characters are wonderfully deep too, we learn so much about them and we get to see them played by such great actors. Pesci, De Niro, and Stone all turn in marvelous performances, especially Stone (this was her Academy Award nomination). The story is very interesting and you won't be bothered by the somewhat long runtime because of the good pacing and the level of interest. There is just so much happening with these interesting, very damaged characters that you won't wanna turn away, I sure didn't. I love this film and highly recommend it to anyone who likes this type of thing. 10/10!",10,2,4,8 April 2018
Footloose," One of the best remakes or teen movies I've seen
","First, I'd like to start with the great cast here! Julianne Hough was fantastic as opposite Kenny Wormald, who was a fantastic updated Kevin Bacon in this movie! Also, Andie Macdowell and Dennis Quaid were the perfect choices for Mr. and Mrs. Moore. This movie really captured the footloose energy! It excelled as the newer updated version of the 1984 classic! The director was very successful with making the film enjoyable for today's generation, and fans of the original as well! The dramatic scenes and well written dialogue contributed a great deal to the success of this 80's remake. The choreography in the dance scenes were so well constructed and executed, it was intense, sexy, and exciting!! I really believe most anyone will LOVE this very well made film! 10/10 excellent!!",10,0,5,5 July 2015
Deadpool," One of the best Marvel movies
","Deadpool (2016) is an interesting movie, because it's Marvel and all, but it's not at all your typical Marvel hero movie. If you're going into this one thinking it's going to be like Iron Man or Spider Man or something, then you'll be very shocked. It's not really a superhero movie, more like a comedic revenge action movie with some romance mixed in. And the content is also very different, a lot more explicit, R rated. But ya know, that stuff works and fits this one. I really like that this movie ventured out and did that because it fit the tone of the whole thing. Ryan Reynolds was a great fit for the lead character. He delivers all the hilarious lines in his own way, and it just works. I can't think of an actor that would have done a better job with portraying this particular role. The entertainment is so fresh here, from the witty script to the well orchestrated action sequences. All the other cast members are great too, the villain especially. I loved the movie, and I think anyone that's a Marvel fan and doesn't mind edgier content will love it too.",9,2,4,28 March 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Pretty good action spy flick
","This was a good fun spy action packed film! Samuel L. Jackson performed wonderfully here, as did his co-star Colin Firth! Michael Caine also gave a commendable performance! I thought the acting was spot on here! I loved the characters also! The action and special effects was pretty good as well. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the more graphic violence, but I was able to overlook it. The overall plot was fun and enjoyable too. This movie was very fun and cool to sit and enjoy with a bag of popcorn! So sit down and enjoy! Oh but FYI: if u don't like profanity or if it offends you, BEWARE! A solid seven out of ten for Kingsman: the secret service",7,3,7,15 August 2015
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," My favorite twilight movie
","To be honest, this is the best installment in the twilight saga. It's not only the most entertaining, but it is also the most well made cinematically. The cast is the same of course, except for Bryce Dallas Howard as Victoria. I really liked Howard as Victoria, I think that she's actually better than the original actress that played her in the first twilight movie. And I think that the main reason this movie is the best is because it has a great balance of action, romance, and a good storyline to go along with it. The first one was all about introducing the characters and getting everything set up. The second was all about Bella trying to make it without Edward and exploring her relationship with Jacob. And this third movie has made it through the introducing and the obstacles new moon gave us, and now it's all about Bella and Edward strengthening their relationship, fighting the evil forces threatening them, and events that lead up to the two breaking dawn films. The acting is pretty good in my opinion, sure I guess things can get a little cheesy at times, but that's excusable. I enjoyed the action sequences and I liked the writing overall. I give The twilight saga: eclipse an 8/10.",8,0,1,8 April 2017
Minions," Despicable Me movies were better.......
","First of all, I'd like to start this review off on a positive note, and that note is Sandra Bullock as Scarlet Overkill, she was great as the lead villain! The first part of the film was pretty entertaining, telling the story of how the minions came to be, and how they came to America in 1968. The first about 30/40 minutes was very entertaining, but it seemed to kinda go downhill from there. It wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't nearly as good as the despicable me movies. I was a little disappointed by minions, mainly by comparing it to other movies. I'm not saying minions is bad, it really isn't, it's just definitely not as good as the despicable me movies, keep that in mind if/when u do see it. 6/10. Like I said scarlet overkill was really good, and the main three minions had their funny moments as well.",6,6,11,9 July 2015
Incredibles 2," Not as good as #1, but still very entertaining
","I am a big fan of the first incredibles film, one of my favorite animated features. It was very well made, and many of the good things they did in the first film is in this one too. I loved the chemistry between all the characters... the same great chemistry from the first. The actors all did great jobs with the voicing of the characters. Helen Parr/Elastagirl really shines here, she is the main focal point throughout the majority of the film, and I was glad she was because its so entertaining to see Helen kick butt, and it was fun to see Bob/mr incredible have to stay home and try his best alone with the kids. Being alone with them proves very hard, especially when Jack Jack starts experimenting with his powers... Which leads to some very funny moments. The villain was voiced well (Catherine Keener), this is a spoiler but honestly I could who the villain was early on... I think Evelyn was a pretty good villain, not the best I've seen but still pretty good. The first incredibles is nearly impossible to live up to completely... and this sequel doesn't but its still a really good film and a worthy sequel. 8/10 for Incredibles 2.",8,10,16,25 June 2018
A Walk to Remember," Sweet and endearing with its shortcomings
","Nicholas Sparks' A walk to remember is one of the many book to big screen adaptations of his novels. I have not read this book so I won't be able to make comparisons between the two, bit I'll just give a summary on why I think this film deserves a 6/10. First of all, I liked the cast, Mandy Moore and Shane west do a good job at carrying the lead roles and the romantic relationship that forms with them, their chemistry also works really well, it just flows naturally between them. I also like seeing Daryl Hannah playing Landon's mother, loved her from Steel Magnolias (1989). The movie is fairly predictable except for one sad twist at the end, other than that it's pretty run of the mill. The romantic scenes between West and Moore are very cute and they do their job well, it achieves the desired goal. Some of the scenes in between the beginning, romance scenes, and the ending can drag a little, be kinda lifeless. If the acting hadn't been good, west and Moore had poor on screen chemistry, or the romance scenes hadn't been good, then I would absolutely hated it. But those three factors saved this movie from being a complete and utter disaster. I'll summarize it briefly like this: it's a cute well acted teen romantic drama that has some boring scenes that drag. 6/10.",6,0,0,22 March 2017
Sin City," Unique
","Sin City can be summed up in one word, unique. It really is very unique. The cinematography and nature of it all is very different. It's based on a series of graphic novels. It's a film that's told in parts, it's not all one story, rather it's many different stories all wrapped up into one crazy film. There are many different Hollywood stars that make up the cast here. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel, Mickey Rourke, Carla Gugino, Elijah Wood... and more. I can say that i really enjoyed the acting in this film, i was impressed by the strong performances given. The characters are all broken in some way, struggling with their own issues. This movies takes place in a city that has so many violent issues, and violent screwed up characters. The police force is mostly corrupt, and there are people that would rather kill you than look at you around every corner. It's definitely another world.The visuals are all well done for sure, the film-noir look is cool and i enjoyed that style. The violence is appropriately graphic given the kinds of people that this film focuses on and the area it's set in. The writing is fine, I personally wasn't terribly impressed by it, it's really the acting and visuals that impressed me most. There are parts I enjoyed more than others. I would say overall that this film is good and it's well made, I just personally didn't love it like most do.7/10.",7,0,0,14 April 2018
The Ugly Truth," Pretty cute
","The Ugly truth is actually a pretty good romantic comedy. Gerard Butler is good as the starring role, and so is Katherine Heigl. The plot is actually something that hasn't been done a lot before, and it's very interesting. The dialogue between characters and the script is pretty well written, there are many funny lines of dialogue that had me laughing hard. The two leads really work well together and have great chemistry. There are also some pretty funny physical gags in the film. Yes, it's pretty formulaic and yes it's pretty predictable, but it's still a very enjoyable fun and often times warm hearted movie. Katherine is really just so lovable and great in her role! And Gerard Butler is often times a very ass****ish character, but it's for good reason, and his character does progress over time, and becomes likable as well. 8/10 for The Ugly Truth.",8,1,2,8 April 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," Mixed feelings....
","This movie starts out like any other, with the clichés and typical horror movie stupid teens, but then takes a complete 180!! They resurrect a bunch of zombies, that office people are controlling, and making sure that everyone dies when they are supposed to, and so on and so forth. I didn't like how light hearted they felt about killing innocent people, I found that to be offensive. Although it is original and rather clever. Then 2 of them figure out what the heck's going on, but wait, then Sigourney Weaver shows up, and explains how the gods of the earth must have a sacrifice of stupid teen blood in a certain order, or the world will END. And Of course the world ends up ending, which I don't Really like it when a movie ends with the destruction of the entire earth, I feel empty about it, since the world ended, although thus film was entertaining and very original. Also I love how those 2 office guys died, and I adore Sigourney Weaver, so I was happy to see her! 6/10!",6,1,3,22 March 2015
Spectre," Not as good as sky fall, but not bad
","Spectre (2015) is a pretty entertaining and a very well after film. Daniel Craig continues his good 007 persona, and it works here as it has in the previous installments. Ralph Fiennes was a very good choice to fill Judi's role of M, even though no one, and i mean no one can ever play that role as well as she did. But anyways, the action sequences were well done, and had entertaining and dazzling effects as far as explosions, hand to hand combat, and killings. Christopher Waltz was perfect in the antagonist role! He sure as heck did not disappoint with his breathtaking performance. The script was both well written and well executed. They payed good omage to Judi dench here, which I was very very thankful for because I just loved her so much in the previous Bond films, she was always spot on and never ever flinched and missed her mark. So yes, the cast did well, the action that is promised delivers, and the script is well written. The only flaw I would say is it slows up in the middle and it becomes less interesting and less engaging than the previous movie, skyfall. Skyfall was absolutely fantastic and I loved it ALL the way through, I cannot say the same about Spectre, but I can say it is a pretty good action/007 film and they left it to where they could hang up the bond series with this film, not sure if they will, who knows, but if they do, they ended it well. 7/10 for Spectre.",7,1,9,27 February 2016
Joy," Very well acted
","Joy is based off of a true story about a woman who invents a mop unlike any other ever produced before and tries desperately to get it on the market. This woman is played by Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence plays her wonderfully, very raw and skillful performance. We get similar performances from the rest of the cast. Robert De Niro gives a great performance that is sometimes pretty explosive, his character is kind of polarizing. But if anyone can play it well it's De Niro. Virginia Madsen is also here, she plays the ex wife of Robert De Niro and the mother of Jennifer Lawrence. Madsen is one of my favorite actresses and she doesn't disappoint here, her character is sort of reclusive in a way. Isabella Rossellini (death becomes her) plays a woman De Niro is seeing and helps Lawrence in trying to get her invention up and running. The script isn't the greatest ever, nor is it poor, I'd say it's a little above average. It's true that Joy isn't the best film Lawrence has ever starred in, but it's still worth a watch, I suggest Joy for anyone who is a fan of the cast members. I give Joy a 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,12 April 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," A really entertaining nonstop action flick!
","I never thought I'd see Charlize Theron like this, but boy she really pulls it off well!! The makeup and costume design was just great, very impressive! And the special effects were incredible! The action sequences were very exciting and high octane. Tom Hardy was also very good in his role, from straight up body type to his acting. The actor that played the king was really done up well as far as makeup and costumes. I mean wow! I was very impressed with this movie's visuals, I'll be surprised if it doesn't get some Academy award attention! If you're looking for a nonstop constant exciting high-octane action film with great acting, great make up, and great costumes, then this one is for you! 10/10 for Mad Max: fury road",9,2,14,9 July 2015
Gladiator," Now THIS is a best picture!
","Gladiator really is one of the greatest films ever made! It has everything that a movie like this needs to have in order to be successful. It has an amazing cast of talented actors that nail their characters and give marvelous performances. It has impeccable set design and costumes that creates the time and place in which the entire movie takes place. It has a script that is so well written that you will never become bored or wish that the movie would hurry up. When you combine all of these things together how could the film not turn out to be the winner of five academy awards and become one of the top rated movies ever. The acting first of all. Russel Crowe is amazing as Maximus, he gives such a focused, raw, intense performance that will without a doubt move you to tears. Phoenix is also great here, very evil dedicated character that will do anything, basically there are no limits to his wickedness and Phoenix plays it all so well. So all in all the acting is out of this world great. The story is very well put together and it has the appropriate emotional ties built into it so that the audience is pulled in and they care about the characters and what happens to them. The combat sequences are very very well filmed, I was impressed by the quality of those scenes in particular. The sets and costumes and just about anything technical is all very intricate and done with careful attention to detail. 10/10 for Gladiator! And I adored the ending by the way, how touching and what a right way to wrap things up.",10,1,1,24 April 2017
Contact," Very engaging science fiction film
","Contact (1997) is a Robert Zemeckis film based on the 1985 novel by Carl Sagan. I have not read the novel with which this movie is based off of, but I don't think I need to in order to see the greatness of this movie. It tells the story of Dr. Eleanor Arroway, a radio astronomer who hears a signal over her radio that she thinks might be aliens trying to contact them, hence the title. Once the signal is researched further, of course, the United States government and other international governments get involved and want to know what it means. The plot might sound like just another simple cookie cutter alien film, but I found Contact to be much more. The script is written in a way that allows for plenty of character development and depth. This is in no way a simple film, it is complex and will keep your attention the whole way through. The filmmakers make you care deeply about Jodie Foster's character. I love how they showed her as a child and they displayed her close relationship with her father. This plays a key role later on in the movie. The acting by every actor in the film is very good too. Jodie Foster gives a very powerful and gripping performance that touches the audience. Matthew is also good here, this is the first major film he ever did. The visual are overall impressive as the sound was good enough to earn an academy award nomination. The film really is very well made, meaningful and entertaining and I recommend it. 9/10.",9,0,0,18 June 2017
The Proposal," A delightful movie
","The Proposal is an entertaining good time that'll warm your heart while laughing. First of all, let me just say that Betty white is Queen and rules over all lol. White is absolutely hilarious as grandma Annie, I adored her lines of dialogue, and there is absolutely no one that could have delivered them better, she has great moments of physical comedy as well, the nature worshiping scene is so good. Sandra bullock does not fail to please, with this and the blind side both in one year, she rocked 2009! As for Ryan Reynolds, he fits the leading man role well and I think Sandra and he had really natural chemistry together. The writing fits well throughout the movie, some parts it's funny and in others it's sweet and makes you become invested the characters. I am a big Mary Steenburgen fan too, both in her movies and just her as a person, and I loved her here, it's not like there's a whole whole lot to her role, but still I think she was very convincing. The male stripper scene is hilarious, it may be a bit too strong for some viewers, so there's a warning for ya, but I thought it was funny, Sandra's reaction is priceless. The ending is sweet and it's refreshing to see a movie like this every once in a while. 8/10 for the proposal!",8,0,0,5 September 2016
The Birds," Fantastic classic!
","Probably Hitchcock's greatest film ever released!! The Birds is a very creepy, well written and acted, and with good effects (for 1963 at least). Tippi Hedren really stole the show as the leading role here, along side Rod Taylor, who acted well here too. Then, there's Jessica Tandy, who I personally loved in the birds! Everyone definitely knew what they were doing with this film. Also, this movie has some pretty intense scenes that will keep you right on the edge of your seat! The script is very well put together, and really delves into each individual character, not that I expected anything less from Mr. Alfred Hitchcock. I enjoyed listening to the dialouge between the characters. I also liked the actiony edge of your seat intense scenes that Hitchcock sprinkled into the movie. Very well made likable movie! 9/10",9,2,3,18 November 2015
Sully," All about Hanks's performance really
","Sully is a movie based off the true events where captain sullenberger landed the plane he was flying from New York to Charlotte on the Hudson River. Just after taking off from LaGuardia airport, US Airways Flight 1549's engines had a huge flock of birds fly straight into their engines and had both taken out upon impact. The pilot and co-pilot had to scramble to figure out what the hell they could do to land safely and ensure every passengers survival. Tom Hanks and his acting really is what makes this movie worth a watch. It's a relatively short film and it feels short because of the crash sequences and the scenes showing what actually happened during the whole terrifying ordeal. I really liked those scenes that focused on what actually happened because that makes it all real and it puts actual human faces to this true event. Aaron Eckhart does a good job with his role too, he plays the co-pilot that assisted captain sullenberger in pulling off the 'miracle on the Hudson'. I bought both all of the performances in the film and I thought the scenes showing what happened were done well. Other than that the other scenes don't really carry much weight, that's why it's not like a 9 or a 10. With all factors considered, I think a 7 out of 10 is fair for sully.",7,0,0,22 April 2017
Alien: Covenant," Interesting and very bleak
","OK so to start off I want to say: Prometheus is one of my absolute favorite films and the alien film series is my favorite film series. I think that Prometheus was marvelously done and it explored very interesting thought provoking ideas that I was eager to see continued in this film. I want to be clear by saying that this is more so of a traditional alien film than Prometheus was. Prometheus was very different than the other alien films and I loved it for that, not to say that I didn't like the other alien films because I did, but Prometheus was just so smart and it did a wonderful job setting things up and giving you a view into how everything started. Alien covenant does answer some lingering questions that I had, but then it doesn't answer some others that I hope future films will. The acting is wonderful, I absolutely loved Michael Fassbender, he really is the true star of this film. The imagery, the scenery, and the visual effects are just as stunning as they were in Prometheus. The biggest thing that I was interested in in Prometheus was the idea of the engineers and I was really interested in their storyline and I wanted to find out more about them, because as anyone who's seen Prometheus knows, it leaves you wondering and wanting more. The engineers actually aren't a huge part of the movie, they're in there, but they only take up a small portion, and yes technically you are given a little more background but I wasn't satisfied with how they handled the engineers, I felt that needed more elaboration. The aliens and how they are created and David are the main things that are explored in this movie. I really did like the way they handled David and the direction they took his character, I wasn't expecting some of the things that happened with him, but I won't give that away. The action scenes are done well, but action really isn't a lot of what this movie focuses on, which I really like, because truth be told, I didn't go into this movie to see action sequences, I went to get answers to questions about Prometheus and to see where they were going to take this intriguing series. I think this movie was very interesting and it holds your attention the whole way through and I like for the most part what they're doing with the series, like I said, there are things that I wish they would have explained in more detail, but all in all Alien: Covenant is a very well done installment into the amazing Alien franchise. 8/10.",8,21,42,31 May 2017
The Wizard of Oz," Absolute classic!
","The Wizard of Oz (1939) is an absolute classic and I have always loved this film ever since I was a kid. It's just perfect for a family to watch together and enjoy. The script is packed with good hearted dialogue, some humor, and a lot of fun adventure. The cast does very well. I love Judy Garland and not only was she a great actress, but a wonderful singer too. Somewhere over the rainbow is of course a classic song and garland performs it wonderfully. There are many other musical numbers throughout the rest of the film that are done very well. The visuals are from 1939, so of course you can't expect them to be great, but I still think they're bright and fun, in a classic way. The acting is great from all cast members, there are moments between the characters that have great chemistry and add depth to the movie as a whole. The film is of course predictable and practically everyone in the world has seen it and heard of it, but even still, its very fun to watch and enjoy. 10/10. Occasionally I like to go on amazon prime and watch it.",10,5,6,2 August 2017
Up in the Air," Very well done, engaging film
","Up in the Air (2009) is a film that really does engage its audience. The acting from George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, and Anna Kendrick is all great, they all deserved their academy award nominations. This film revolves around George Clooney's character and his journey through a time of change in his life. Farmiga plays a woman that Clooney sees occasionally in between flights, they usually talk some and have sex, they establish a fairly casual relationship, no real commitments. And Anna Kendrick plays a just out of college newbie that Clooney is showing the ropes to. I was very impressed with how well these talented actors commanded the screen and how they had good chemistry too. I cannot reveal very much more about the plot without giving away spoilers and I don't wanna do that. I'll just say that this film doesn't turn out to be conventional or predictable in any way shape or form. The script is written in a very attention grabbing and intelligent way. You will not be bored at any point while watching this film. The top notch acting, engaging writing and interesting storyline is all too much combined for ones attention to wander. I vigorously encourage everyone to see this film. 8/10 for Up in the Air.",8,1,3,13 July 2017
The Island," Very cool entertaining movie!
","The Island (2005) is a very high octane, action packed, well written, and intriguing movie. Scarlett Johansson and Ewan Mcgreggor do a great job as the two leads, they had awesome characters and they portrayed them really well! Sean Bean was also very good in his twisted character with a sort of god complex. The whole plot of the island is very intricate and clever. I really loved the action sequences and the violence in this movie, none of it was graphic and it was all fun and entertaining to see. Michael Bay did a really great with this movie. I don't care what people say, I think he's a talented film director, and he directed the island very well. The dialogue between and the script was all great and well put together. Dijimon did a good job as well, he was intense and very into the character. Ewan and Scarlett really did have great chemistry together! You could really tell that the love and the feelings between their characters were real and true, no one in this film 'phoned in' their performance, I was thankful for that. This movie is deeper and has more heart than I expected, it really reached me and some scenes were emotional because it was so sad. I applaud Michael bay and the entire cast and crew of the island! Job well done! 9/10.",9,0,1,16 January 2016
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," I really don't get why audiences enjoyed this....
","Oh brother where art thou is a very strange film. I wonder if I'm just not the right kind of person to watch and enjoy this, I know lots of viewers like this movie, but I absolutely hate it. I think George Clooney is a very talented actor and I usually like him both on the big screen and in real life, but he just really annoyed me here. His acting seems way too over the top funny and it's all just too obvious. What I mean by that is that I don't really like it when actors deliver comedic lines so obviously that it's not funny, I prefer more dry/witty type humor. But it's not just the way the actors say the lines, it's also the writing, it's too over the top and obvious. When comedic dialogue is written in that way, in my opinion, they lose their appeal and amusement factor. It drains the funny reaction out that the audience is supposed to experience. And the issue is that it's not like this movie drops lines like that, it's all the time, I could forgive a few moments like that, but not all throughout the whole thing.... So really since the comedy didn't work for me and actors that I normally like were held captive to this bad writing, the whole thing just doesn't work. Also I really hate bluegrass music so whenever that would occur it would just make it that much worse. 1/10.",1,5,12,20 March 2017
Furious 7," A very high octane entertaining installment
","This film has everything you could want from a fast n furious movie and more! As always, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker do a great job along with Dwayne Johnson, who entered the franchise from fast five. This movie has killer action sequences, whether it's cars falling out of the sky, fist fights, or even cars flying into sky scrapers. If you are a die hard fast and furious fan I really don't think that you could be disappointed by furious seven. Paul Walker as everyone knows died in the past year and in the end of the film they did a small tribute to him featuring the song by Wiz Khalifa see you again. A lot of people in the theater got very emotional including me just because he was such a great guy and a great character in the fast and furious franchise, I was very glad that they recognized him! We do have some new comers to the franchise including Jason Statham and Kurt Russell, and I felt that both used their screen time wisely and portrayed their character very well. I was very impressed with Jason Statham, he always does action movies that's his typecast, but I felt in this role he really portrayed a great villain for the film! Kurt Russell did a great job as a member of the crew that is trying to take down Statham. One thing is for sure, you will never be bored with this film, it is high-octane, it is full of action, it has great dialogue, even if you're not a die-hard fast and furious fan, I still think you will be very pleased with this film! I think it's just the right found that Paul Walker needed to say goodbye, it is going to be hard to see anymore of the films in the franchise without Paul Walker, I just hope they don't kill off his character, I hope they retire his character respectively, without killing him off. 9/10 for Furious Seven! 👍🏼",9,1,3,30 June 2015
