Casablanca," The unusual suspects and a broken bottle of water
","'Casablanca' (1942) made by Michael Curtiz is something like a romantic preview of a nothing to do waiting for a failed encounter in flashback, because a lady didn't came when the town was almost surrounded just after he was searched by enemies. An action movie as 'Casablanca' is still like a labyrinth in the confused story told by this B picture, within a mythic atmosphere behind the history itself as too surcharged by a post-colonial era cult now. The comic scene for instance - like one of the countless - that is one of the best of this movie, as while it is pretext for describing on the local market a tent with the bargained artifact seeming a trousseau, whose price is reduced almost for less than a half since the short beginning of the purchase, but which never occurs because the lady doesn't want it. Meanwhile Rick comes at her across the tents, nevertheless the local trader is still insisting for selling it, because he knows him and his reputation as a kind of protector - in such a matter, as business as usual, like an expert of the town - also it is of course of a great value, from the colonial folk state of moving facts under the rule of the Casbah and like it occurs also in any black market of the kind, as too for the traditional searching of the lost documents, for buying the tickets further going away from this purgatory. Mrs. Ferrara is the real mastermind of the alternative power in the Casbash mystery way of living, an acculturated Italian with a store with coffee-shop rivalizing by day with the night-club of Rick concerning searching a way to go away from this land and having always in his hands a kick-flies to close each time his interventions as if human beings in transit were less important than immediate sanity around him because the heat, backgrounded maybe by his past in Tunis by his local hat and way of talking from a fat man with a dangerous and quite hypnotical smile, whose to make common affairs with Rick leave Rick cool in a quick ambiguous answer for another next meeting. Back in the middle of the movie, there is a set nicknamed the Rick's Américain Café, a kind of store for foreigners and else station bar, where the brothers Epstein and Koch improvised in a daily basis the story lines, as in the studio itself during the shootings for the next scene. That never happens after the plane take-off and the unusual suspects are spelled since then, when someone like a dull with uniform as in the flux of events said 'round up all the usual suspects' and finishing it after the noise of the Dakota plane going slowly far away. Even the bottle of mineral water open by the French police officer, after the customs and hangar zone outside where the telephone is with the German corpse nearby, but not at all drink to the bottom because we saw only one or two swallows by the mustache that thrown it one quarter empty with a chock on the box near the ground without broken it as resistant it was the kind of glass of this Vichy it seems to him by chance.",Null,0,3,4 October 2007
To Be or Not to Be," Any partner resembles him
","'To be or not to be' (1942) directed by Ernst Lubitsch is like answer to the question, without knowing that some of the characters were talking about a play concerning an invader, but coming soon maybe will watching it. What means the touch of Lubitsch ? An invisible taste for the crazy happening not programmed by the screenplay, even not necessarily as an improvisation, but much more as a kind of refraction among the characters in a given scene of clarification, where every behavior is mainly at high expression by its reflection on the others as mannequins manipulated in a true scene of life, before the unthinkable of the gestures and compasses as dramatic rule of the comedy. While non sense switch slowly or quickly as harlequins of posterity in a new sense of a given detail, as the kitsch itself of retroactive modernity from the personality at the better of the story. Normally it arrives just when two thirds of the duration occurred and something improvable and improbable of new happens and pick out.Warsaw before the war, not at all but just in time to play the comedy on stage, whilst meanwhile the audience of foreign viewers would be from those whom the players are acting, either with their uniforms. As though liking seemingly of the same Hitler's clothes, perhaps or even any partner resembles him but from the other opposite side truly. And it happens... It is supposed to be a great movie in black and white, a comedy about national socialism and its specific fairly way of exposure of uniforms and songs as opera given by aristocrats feelings to the insignificant people of the corner of the next small street with commerce stores, as if it was possible being assimilated with them without any single purpose of the racial division between superior and inferior status forgotten at the time with its tricky conception of unemployed under class. The style of the director Lubitsch was having his so-called touch of history, with the invasion of Poland to the go in 1939, like the play performed by this story of Jewish theater. Or, doing it for having this qualification, as composed by migrant workers, like fake actors playing the invader without knowing that it arrives for just the premiere of the play. And perhaps their inclusion in a concentration camp nearby, if they don't take some measures of desecration before the oppressor as one of them said subtly in one ambiguous line. This movie it was a fairly tale out of any reality show, because sound predominates over sights. It was a demonstration by absurd. It seems as a gloss over -one year after Hess was escaping by plane from Germany to England for convincing the authorities there of both countries to make a deal for a conditioned war -, limiting the foolish way that turned in between. Lubitsch as director was maybe sensible to this involuntary comic boundary of such a tragedy when America was still hesitating for participation in the war at Europe, misgiving about any overview from there about the gravity of the ferocity against Eastern peoples and slave labor on concentration camps and the lack of hygiene on ghettos.",Null,0,1,19 November 2007
The Hustler," Towards the bankruptcy of the odd welfare state
","'The Hustler' (1961) made by Robert Rossen from a sad novel with the same title and this is still an odd movie, in which it was for the most of its duration located in a main set. Like the backstage of people surviving as they could, before they lost any opportunities for choosing their way, as searching misery by non sense of daily life in an urban surviving style at the backyards of night activity. It was this lack of poetry from such an ordinary people, nonetheless skilled and waiting for chance in their lives, that this movie wins its fame as hymn of wrong side from the consumption society of values, to the time when should fighting for more dignity in their social blindness. This is still a portrait of modern misery, with a slight touch of gangsterism in a dramatic pause for any kind of sport. Where a big guy doesn't like anymore lose whatsoever, when gambling with such a young man in the middle of night till dawn. The quality of the main prize here is having for the least his thumbs broken and a less crippled girl as lover, because she killed herself meanwhile waiting for his lost soul helping still her busy dependence.In this small universe of little corruption there, getting from the ground of bitter expectancy, as though a new kind of morality to the loser by such a convenience of the boss from his own tough underground soul, that still he - the young character of a snooker's player - will have much for learning about his ambition and ambitious career for this candid fellow here. Meanwhile, staying alive of course is enough and thinking better with such an empiric mind of daily struggle on snooker - green tableland of caves with smoking fog, sleeping in degraded hotels with cockroaches on the bed - is not so easy for instance. This movie also displays us degradation, as inside a fake luck's mentality for winning for the less an abyss by the lack of resources, even though the currency there it is not always favorable at the hands of such a young individual, in an odd match of snooker forever with apparently no way out.What can he does, on the spot's snooker with such a style, when then he was here with both hands in such a weakened condition, for would thinking to play again less better next time, with such an adversary who controls himself the gambling landscape nearby in this borough ? The scene that shows us a resigned man, watched as though with his own professional way of life cutting down for a while - out of the labor, perhaps as a new kind of vagabond from the roads - in this kind of provoked fatality in his capabilities, it is illuminated crudely with the neon on the ceiling and the shadows on the walls of such a kind of new misery, in a place where predominated individuals like some of the same generation of men without scruples nor comprehension for a young winner needing a renewed of the beginning of his life properly. This is irony about the contrast between the two gamblers, in a fake trend with the robbery of the money, as win it by the character of a gambler performed at this stage by Paul Newman in his best movie ever, it seems now. The money that is not due by the strength of the next events, it is in itself enough as symbolizing an atmosphere but quite dry on its smooth for displaying in its anodyne brutality and sordid welfare at stake in such a defeat. It was an odd story, without another immediate sequel at the same decade, like a television story later.",Null,2,2,30 March 2008
All Quiet on the Western Front," Carnage and alert
","'All quiet on the Western front' (1930) directed by Lewis Milestone as a free adaptation of a well known novel concerning the absurd of war, when made on the back of soldiers inside the trenches, it was also as movie in itself a spell for attention and too concerning the stupidity of a necessary and anguished delay during the First War to finish the job. Meanwhile, continuing the conflict in Europe, just when the countries engaged were also on the mud, to coming out with the help of such generals. In which the bad luck was at that moment in both sides, but remaining on the back of the warrior's situation on the ground. There are some scenes very famous in this movie : the beer house as place for fraternization among inmates from an inner circle of Thule, supporting the continuation of the war in 1916 as it was an envision and a prophecy, the overexposing sights with the helmets on the heads of the soldiers dead on the trenches as ghosts on a dark sky and a battle across the wires which took an aura of fame to this pictures around the world. The story of this movie was not also only an epic reconstitution, but otherwise like much more as barely the reconstitution of a small world with some turnabouts of destiny daily, either as if it was worsen the economic situation and even open a new global crisis, almost after the end of this kind of an unique warrior's epic story of trenches. The book of Remarque putting in sight by Milestone's direction was a synthesis of honor, expressing mainly the idea that school is the place where teenagers had learned the defense of war by a given teacher, who inflames them for fighting in support of nationalism and expansionism of their country. However, after that experience of one of the young men from this classroom on the very hole of the front's trenches against French army deployment, this one returns during a break telling his own reality there as pure horror and by this contrast between classroom and school teaching with his mates on the backward, the personality of this teacher is questioned and demystified in his retrograde speech of submission, before the inevitability of war and its fake greatness on the ground. After that, this same soldier returns to the trenches, when things apparently were on an impasse. Such an advantage for making a plot with recent history, imagined as story of an opening conscience from the contact with the destruction as result of a war, whose trenches were the artificial new borders like a cemetery of souls in collective despair, it was the must of the novel itself, when by chance after it was pictured on the screen with much more compacted strength by its plasticity. Also discovering in the main character as an absurd of representing any young human being dead, before the range of searched happiness since the childhood and scholarship. Depassed, suddenly, without the time for maturity and for loving another half a face of other genre, not keeping in touch even with such dreamed development for his hopeful future, on the landscapes from a nowhere finished countryside, for the sake's owner mentality of a citizenship, interrupted by an anonymous shot. Thus, provoking such a fortuity, like this same casualty before the peace arrival, instead into a social disjunction not waited by the old society, responsible of bloodiness and lack of adjustment to the losses, indeed in fighting for a wanton defeat as metamorphosis of beauty from the horror and pain in staccato.",Null,0,2,4 November 2007
To Kill a Mockingbird," Vulgarity of discernment on the spot
","'To kill a mockingbird' (1962) directed by Robert Mulligan is as movie a kind of feeling adapted from a novel well known, in which the silly blockade of almost an entire community of prejudice in citizenship above all, it's quite enough for breaking with such irrationality at stake, substituting the democratic logic of institutions concerning justice, freedom and equality of opportunities. Although as absurd of colonization and independence and speculative origin of humankind like a truth learned in school, the strength of mistaken conception impulses vulgarity of discernment on the spot. What is important here is also that the alleged majority of this community understood at the time what makes it out of mind , when a lawyer brought to them action at the court. Even not waiting for a sentence protecting him against the mob nor because given the part of his legal speech impeaching accusation against his own customer, a poor man with a fake rape on the back of his imprisonment by authorities. The fact that this movie is an adaptation from a novel, whose events are described by a child as such an adolescent before the date, which means that the universe described is quite the same of 1927, it seemed also from the written description of a year that took the social attention in all America, when at the same time other events about injustice were still more flagrant than this usual case of unconformity by a young lawyer, to the banality of the smashed human being in his growth for more attention from the authorities themselves. A melodrama like that, when the law itself was out of mood for the decreasing of segregationist activities in 1962 putting it on the screen, it was for the director Robert Mulligan still a problem of other nature. Because the public opinion was slowly changing since the fifties, even in great speed namely with the young and the integration was never strong than then, by which the viewers opened their mind to such a limit case with two generations before of retard, from the impact of the irrationality on their bad conscience. Before the African roots of part of its population there, as reminiscent link with mental reduction or exclusion from inequality configuration of bodies and education of souls. This is why the child helps to understand the sweet touch of mercy and the foolish act of the lawyer for a lost cause from there.",Null,0,2,15 November 2007
