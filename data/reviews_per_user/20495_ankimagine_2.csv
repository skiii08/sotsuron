Skyfall," Boring and Different in a bad way
","Skyfall is very different than other bond movies in many ways. It has got no gadgetry except a big GPS tracking system which is an insult to gadgetry. No girls or actress since the villain took care of her. And M dies at the end. What kind of a bond movie is that?? People want to watch bond using gadgets, blowing up stuff and charming women and stopping a villain causing some major catastrophe. But in this, the villain has weird goals. He just wanted to kill M and he succeeded at last though got killed too. Which sums it up to pretty weak plot and eventually boring movie.I regret spending 200 bucks in skyfall. Please don't watch it. It will ruin your whole day.",1,14,29,14 November 2012
Casablanca," Didn't like it
","I really didn't like the movie. I watch plenty of movies both new and old. Its also not that i don't like oldies(really liked City lights, Roman Holiday, 12 angry Men) and i am huge fan of classics. But this was a really weird movie and I certainly dint get what the movie was all about. Boring to hell, very slow and lots of talk. Though i agree that acting was great, specially of the Rick character, actress was really beautiful and therefore I gave this movie a 5 rating or i would have been 1. Maybe I don't have the correct vision for these type of movies so I couldn't get it. But still i would say, this movie sucks.",5,3,11,24 September 2012
