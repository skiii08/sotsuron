The Longest Yard," Adam Sandler in The Longest Yard - Best Movie yet!
",The longest yard was a really great movie. What can you expect when you put 'Adam Sandler' 'Chris Rock' and 'Burt Reynolds' all in one movie? A great film. A lot of my friends that are female seem to think its mainly a guy movie but i quiet enjoyed it and there was a lot of reasons of why it wasn't a guy movie you just have to look for them- I really do give it 10 Stars! :) And its not too often that you end up cheering for the bad guys in movies but in this one you want them to totally kick some butt cause the good guys are actually the bad guys lol...>Good Guy Bad Guy. Adam Sandler was awesome and this movie was hilarious - See it for your self and let me know what your thoughts are as well I am off to read other reviews!,10,0,2,1 June 2005
