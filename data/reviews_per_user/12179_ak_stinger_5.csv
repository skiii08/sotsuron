50 First Dates," Cute date or girls'-night movie
","'50 First Dates' is one of the more enjoyable romantic comedies made in recent years, relying a lot on Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler's chemistry to carry off the out-there but original plot. The idea of Sandler's Henry Roth being the irresistible ladies' man that he's presented to be in the first few minutes is a stretch and thankfully falls away soon after he meets Barrymore's Lucy. What puts this movie above a lot of other Adam Sandler comedies is that, unlike many of his other love interests that might as well be named 'Love Interest' for all they have to do with the plots, Lucy is an actual character who has a journey to go on too. The viewer really wants to see both main characters overcome their obstacles and come together at the end.The supporting cast, however, is not as strong as it could be. Blake Clark delivers a fine performance as Lucy's doting, protective father and Dan Aykroyd has a nice extended cameo as her doctor. However, I don't buy Sean Astin as Lucy's steroid-enhanced, lisping brother; and Henry's sidekicks androgynous Alexa and Ula (Lusia Strus and Rob Schneider, respectively) are good for a gag or two but don't really serve a purpose. Meanwhile, Amy Hill as Lucy's surrogate mother Sue is sadly underused.It's not a perfect movie, but it's a good movie that leaves you smiling at the end.",Null,2,4,22 May 2005
Spider-Man 2," Spider webs are surprisingly deep...
","'Spider-Man 2' is even better than its predecessor. The characterization goes much deeper and the relationships get more complicated. Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker lets us know something that most superhero movies don't: being a superhero is a real time-sucker. His yearnings - for his own life, to be a better student, for Mary Jane Watson - are poignant and you find yourself agreeing that yes, he should be able to live life without the responsibility of keeping people safe and alive. But looking away is hard to do...Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane has really grown since the last movie. She's confident, has a thriving career, and won't put up with Peter's crap even if she does still love him. By the end (and a happy ending at that!) she's proven that she's not a damsel-in-distress but someone who doesn't need to be shielded from the difficulties of life.Solid performances by all of the cast, many hints about future flicks, and all-around good fun. The only complaint I have (and it's not a very big one) is how many times Peter whips off that mask for people....",9,0,1,22 July 2004
Troy," Fine summer fun, worth the price of admission
","I love 'Troy'. It doesn't want to be an Oscar contender; it doesn't want to be a Cliff's Notes version of 'The Iliad'. What it wants to be is good summer fun and it does that beautifully.The film belongs to Eric Bana's Hector. It's a true testament to what a good actor can do in a well-written role. Orlando Bloom has received some criticism for being wimpy and dramatic in the role of Paris, but that's exactly how Paris is supposed to be characterized. The fact that Bloom portray Paris in that way and still gain understanding and a little sympathy for his actions from the audience speaks volumes to his ability as an actor.He just needs a role that will let him shine.The Greeks were admirably portrayed as well. Sean Bean is smooth, charming, and smart in his portrayal of Odysseus. The little amount of screen time he got is a crime. Brad Pitt stretches his acting muscles admirably (anyone who claims Brad Pitt can't act is going on zero or limited exposure to him at his craft and/or is operating under the shallow assumption that anyone who looks that classically handsome can't act). I just don't recommend he make historical epics like this a prominent feature in his career.The women were a bit disappointing. Diane Krueger has the physically characteristics it takes to play Helen, but none of the talent and charisma to be believable. Saffron Burrows is moving but underused as Andromache. Alone, Rose Byrnes gives the movie a strong female presence. Her spirited yet tragic portrayal of Briseis leaves me wondering what she could have done in the role of Helen, which she was originally considered for. The presences of Hector and Paris' mother Hecuba (whose revenge against the Greeks for her family's fate was so terrible that even today her name is associated with evil witchcraft) and their tragically prophetic sister Cassandra are sorely missed.",Null,1,3,2 June 2004
Van Helsing," Save your money and rent later...
","I was very disappointed with this flick. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale, both of whom are capable of riveting performances, were flat and uninteresting. They let the clothes, accents, and weapons do the acting for them. Richard Roxburgh, as Dracula, could be menacing and seductive in quiet moments, but all too easily his performance turns over-the-top. Dracula's brides are shrill and much too annoying to be scary. Igor seems to have inherited the lines of Mr. Freeze from the fourth 'Batman' movie.However, there are reasons that makes this movie a rentable rather than a film to ignore. (1) The flatness of the story and performances of the above-mentioned should diminish a bit on the smaller screen. (2) David Wenham, as Van Helsing's jittery but spunky sidekick Carl, puts more personality into one line than most of the others can put into an entire performance. He's the everyman and the story's humor. (3) Shuler Hensley brings in the heart and soul of the flick as Frankenstein's Monster. He, more than anyone else, captures the humanity of a character. All in all, this is a flick to rent when you don't want to think too hard, not something you shell out movie-ticket money on.",Null,0,0,27 May 2004
X-Men: The Last Stand," Wasted Potential (contains spoilers)
","WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERSHad 'X-Men: The Last Stand' been about either the rise of Jean Grey as Phoenix OR the 'cure' for mutants the movie could have been full of the meaningful allegories and edge-of-your-seat action that made 'X2' such a great film. Instead it tries to tackle both story lines and ends up falling sadly short on both.One major crime was the misuse of characters. The biggest (but not only) faults:  Rogue: Once a major focal point of the series, she vanishes early on in the action and turns up (seemingly as an afterthought) at the very end. One of the plots was about the 'cure' she left to get  wouldn't it have been more meaningful if the audience got to go along on the journey with this character we care about?  Bobby/Iceman: He's unfortunately been afflicted with the same good-guy-blandness that neutered Cyclops in the movies. Before, we cared about him because Rogue cared about him; without her around he's really not very interesting. That would have made his many scenes hard enough to watch even if his storyline hadn't been completely pointless. Kitty: Her character is so generic she might as well be called 'Bobby's Alternative Love Interest'. Honestly, with as much screen time as she got we should have gotten to know something about her besides the facts she can walk through walls and touch Bobby while Rogue can't. Hank/Beast: Another character with a lot of screen time that we didn't know enough about. What's his story? How is it that he's such good friends with the X-Men even though the audience hasn't met him before? Where has he been? How, out of all the mutants in the world, did he get the high position in the federal government? The movie offers few real answers to any of these questions and that makes his character difficult to care about on a personal level.  Angel: This character, on the other hand, has an interesting and relevant back-story that the audience is allowed to know and both it and he are completely wasted. This role is little more than a glorified cameo, which is a shame because the little I saw of him made me want to know more.Mystique/the bad guys: Mystique is such an awesome character and the movie wastes her; instead she is replaced with some new baddies, none of whom we know enough about to be too invested in the Brotherhood-versus-X-Men fights (more on this later).The plots are simply stretched too thin to get enough excitement and emotional impact, and the movie doesn't even seem to try for any of that. Where is Rogue's struggle with her identity as a mutant and how that affected her decision about getting the 'cure'? Where is Warren Worthington II's reaction to being saved by Angel and the mutation he'd tried to 'cure'? Where are the scrimmages between Magneto's Brotherhood and the X-Men that build up the tension and rivalries between the two factions? This movie has no big one-on-one fight scene. Sure, Iceman and Pyro's showdown is cool (no pun intended), but it's hardly on par with past greats such as the glorious and riveting showdown between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike in the second film.There are a lot of flaws in the details too. The dialog is totally dumbed-down (what, isn't anyone in the not-too-distant future capable of speaking in compound sentences anymore?). Most scenes and sequences are rushed and disjointed; and since no one bothers to take the time to flesh out characters, rivalries, and story lines the audience remains fairly emotionally disengaged during the climatic battle at the end. With too much to cover the emotional impact the movie could have had is lost, especially with its sub-par script.Not that 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is without its great moments. The final confrontation between Jean/Phoenix and Professor X is heart-stopping; Magneto moving the Golden Gate Bridge is a highlight of the action sequences; Storm is finally flying; Wolverine lighting his cigar with the burning rubble in the Danger Room simulation is perfectly in character; and Magneto's final scene alone at the chess board is lonely, intriguing, and hopeful all at once. It's too bad these are so few and far between  instead of recapturing the greatness of 'X2', the third X-Men movie is but a shadow of what was.",5,2,4,1 June 2006
