3:10 to Yuma," Over-hyped movie as the plot makes no sense.
","To be honest, even though I appreciate the acting & cinematography departments of this movie, I could not fail to notice, there the direction/screenplay/editing are not up to the mark. To take a few steps back, I do not even understand the entire plot of the movie - 'more than 50 - 60 people get killed in the process of taking one Robber/Killer to board a train which goes to a prison, from where the killer has previously escaped twice.' It felt as if his life was more important that any other nice person or even all of them combined. There was no such progress in the screenplay as to why Ben would connect on an emotional level with Dan all of a sudden (just because the movie is drawing to a close) , and in the end he kills all his gang members including Charlie who was in his side and has traveled from far just to rescue him, no questions asked. All style no substance. Pretty disappointed from a person who likes to watch Bale and Crowe.",7,3,4,27 April 2014
