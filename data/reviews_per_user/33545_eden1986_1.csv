Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is awful movie
","O, it was awful. To say the truth Borat is just a bad movie. Really pathetic and disgusting. Is it funny to see two naked men fighting with each other? Of course Cohen told that this movie is partly documentary but I believe that he lies. It's just a show like wrestling. Do you believe that old man really told this things about homosexuals and Muslims? Do you think that reaction of the audience on rodeo was real? It's obvious that it was a show. Cohen played disgusting character, told lies about Kazakhstan and USA and after all got his money. And some people really believe in this things. Guys don't be so na√Øve. But after all worst thing in this movie is humor. I thought that it couldn't be anything as disgusting as 'My boss' daughter'. It was a mistake. This film shows us a new level of stupid humor: struggle between naked men, toilet on the street and so on. Really I don't know who likes this type of jokes!",2,3,7,25 December 2007
