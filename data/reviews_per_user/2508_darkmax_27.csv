The Ring," Not as good as the original
","Well, despite the bigger production budget this one really did not out do the original Japanese movie. The effects were not uncommon among Hollywood's productions these days. I feel that the ambience of the original story is missing. This played a very important role in the success of the original. The way the Japanese movie was filmed was relatively simple but very effective in overall effects.Don't get me wrong, the prequel and sequel of the Japanese 'The Ring' did not strike me as being better in any way to the original. Of the 4 films I would probably place this one 2nd, but it definitely lacks what the riginal had.",3,0,0,6 November 2002
Star Trek," Star Trek as it should have been
","I'm a Star Trek fan, not a hardcore one, but a fan nevertheless. I'm happy to say, legacy or continuity or not, this is by far the best Star Trek movie. It brings Star Trek officially into the 21st Century.The movie:- 1. has a good fluid plot. 2. uses terms that most non-trekkies would understand. 3. has a good cast of young and skilled actors. 4. depicts a good changing over of guard from old to new. 5. has good bright lighting for sets on the Enterprize. 6. has updated to touchscreens, instead of knobs and switches. 7. has an overall good CGI throughout the movie. 8. has not destroyed the Enterprize.In my opinion, Eric Bana has too little screen time. Now where can I get that Warp Lever from the bridge?",10,2,10,11 May 2009
Akira," Do you seriously think this is that good?
","Well, firstly I have to say that perhaps the American audiences were not exposed to too many Japanese anime. For one, I think this animated movie has been over-hyped by the American public. Frankly, I grew up watching anime and think this is one of the most mediocre. Many other anime have better story, graphics, character-developments and following. If you ask enough Asians about this movie, they would probably have the same comment. This is seriously not as good as you really think.",2,28,64,19 May 2002
Iron Man 2," A good sequel but stop a tad too short of being perfect
","For those of you who said there is little or no story in this movie, just what were you watching? The couple making out in front of you, or were you busy attending to your SMS or email messages? Now I just got to know that Sam Rockwell was a contender for the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark in the first film, I am so glad he didn't get the part and Robert Downey Jr did.In the first movie we got to see a lot more of Iron Man, while Tony Stark stood quietly in the background. In the sequel it is Tony Stark that matters more than Iron Man. In fact Iron Man has become a mere tool for ego and fame and is beginning to become a liability to SI and tony. Unfortunately there isn't enough running time for the director to explore the deeper character of Tony Stark and his struggle with his alter ego and alcohol. Shame.Pepper Pott should have had more anger, anguish and frustration, but the character was not explored.I agree with some reviewers in saying that there is likely a spin-off in the Black Widow character. Although I must say, Scarlet Johannson's performance was a bit off. I always thought the character to be quite a bit colder, as in an ice queen.Is it me or is Samuel L. Jackson putting on tens of pounds?! I could hardly recognize him in the caf√© scene with Robert Downey Jr!!! Shame that Sam Rockwell is still playing villain. He is quite a versatile actor who is constantly under-utilized and under appreciated.Notice how I am talking about characters and not story or the SFX? Well, for those of you watching this movie thinking there is a better story than the first, you do know that you are watching a sequel to a comic superhero screen adaptation. 30-40 years of history does not shrink well into a 2 hour movie... it won't even fit a 10 hour one.As for special effects, what else can you not expect to be thrown into a modern blockbuster like this? Heck, even the kitchen sink can be entirely CG! What's new since Jurassic Park? Overall, there is perhaps a re-watch value somewhere, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket you pay the first time round.",8,17,34,4 May 2010
Alexander," Could have been a lot better
","For those who have voted this as 10, has obviously not watched the movie. Epics have been surprisingly getting better of recent years, however, this one definitely bring it down.Or perhaps they should rename or re-market it as the life story of Alexander the Great. Nothing in the movie is substantially groundbreaking, nor has it any special moments to claim. Even seasoned actors were so tamed in this film.I missed it on the big screen and had to watch this much later on Video, but it is not worth the anticipation. It has been a let down. Did they under-budget this movie?",5,2,4,14 May 2005
Spider-Man 3," Not as interesting
","I liked the first Spidey movie, the second one wasn't as good probably because of my higher expectations..... This one I had some expectations but not as high as those for the second installment.I went in pretty eager to be entertained... Boy, was I bored!! What irritated me the most was Tobey Maguire's attempt at weeping.... so sad.... so very very sad. Mr Maguire, no offense, but that wasn't the least bit convincing.I would have love to see the alien thing creep up and form the suit, rather than become the suit. Also, too much emphasis on Sandman and not sufficient time for Venom. Venom would have been the better villain.",6,2,5,4 May 2007
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Good Ending for the trilogy of 3 trilogies, but don't expect a great movie
","WHAT! REY DIED!!!... Oops! Spoiler alert! Too late?Gotcha!Yes, it is finally the end. This movie ties up most of the loose ends of the previous 8 movies and some. It brings into canon certain things that were once canonical in the expanded universe, but not all (which is the way I like it).It is fairly fast-paced with certain important dialogues and scenes missing to make it a great ending movie. Hopefully this will turn up in some Director's Cut or such. The pace is good enough that you don't feel the passage of the entire 2+ hours, which is always a good thing. If you treat this as an entertainment, it will suffice. If you are a die-hard Star Wars fan, you might come out rather like your sexual partner... unsatisfied.Not going to spoil this movie for everyone. Is it worth the price of the movie ticket, I would say yes. Is it worth more than you paid for, then the answer is a definite 'no'.Just one question, did I miss a scene with Ashoka Tano in it, or was it just that little bit towards the end? This was one of the few movies I have watched beginning to end without a toilet break.",7,1,8,19 December 2019
Watchmen," Sub-adult adaptation of the comic
","I went in with no expectation or disgrunt. I was pleasantly surprised. Not extremely, just pleasantly.This is one of those movies no one has any idea how it will be until it is released. There is enough violence, nudity and gore in there to satisfy the bloodthirsty and perverted movie-goers, but also enough (super)human drama not to make this into another poorly made movie adaptation.The plot is, as with most comics, quite shallow. But not as obvious as Iron Man, Hulk or even Batman Begins (,etc..). What's unusual is the attempt at emphasizing the relationships between the characters. However, the 160+ minutes of the movie simply isn't enough to make the audience feel enough attachment to the characters.CGI, in my honest opinion, is just like every other movie these days. It used to be a novelty, now it is just plain over-used. A note must be taken in that the movie was made to simulated a world where handphones and portable computers have not come of age, a world where younger audiences may not be able to relate to.The nudity and sex scenes were fine. It is unusual for scenes like this to appear in this genre. But isn't it about time? This movie is worth at least 80% of your ticket price.",8,7,15,5 March 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Best Fantasy Movie To Date
","LOTR:FOTR is perhaps the best fantasy movie to date. Most, if not all, that had preceded this movie had been.... poor made at best. It has a good smooth flowing plot (good adaptation from the books) with very believable graphics and make-ups.All the actors portray their characters very realistically, especially Sir Ian McKellen. He brought Gandalf to life. In fact, all of those whom watched it with me, expressed disappointments when he 'died' halfway through the movie.Just can't wait to see the second installment of LOTR. For those who have not read the books, a word of advise: forget the book. This is one of those few shows that many will prefer the movie to the book.",10,1,1,30 April 2002
Wanted," another print to film?
","This film, if taken on its own, isn't all that bad. If you are looking for realistic actions and plausible situations, please do your homework.I am not sure if this is a comic adaptation, but it sure looks like one. In fact in many of the scenes, it reminds me a lot of Matrix and Sin City.The movie basically keeps a good pace with plenty of action sequences between short conversations. Now this is where I love the movie. The dialogues are short, concise and sweet. the only thing I didn't like, the main character being such a useless punk at the beginning. However his transformation into a top-level killer seems rather rushed, sudden to say the least.The twist in the story was expected from the very moment he was made to believe he is the heir to a 'great' legacy. There I smelled the rat and thought it would be far too simple, too straight forward, a movie to be made today.Angelina Jolie is beautiful, however, I had expected more out of her than the role she played in this action movie. BTW, she is showing some aging since her last movie.Overall, the big names are wasted here. This movie could have been made with less budget on the names and more on the story.",7,1,8,26 June 2008
Batman Begins," Better than the first Batman Movie
","I would consider this is the most accurate of all the Batman movie to date, despite the update in technology. It has that dark knight feel to it. Less happy/comical moment, more gloom and seriousness. Now this is Batman.However, I feel Christian Bale may not be the best actor for the costume or Bruce Wayne. I think he looks too.... ordinary.Just out of curiosity, why is Kathy Holmes in the movie? I don't remember her character in any of the comics. Or they just need to add an ornament to the almost all male cast? I certainly hope she will not be in the next movie, her character serve no purpose in there.This movie does feel like Frank Miller's Year 1, which I so happen to own.",8,3,6,16 June 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Almost perfect except for a few points...
","I had been in withdrawal since LOTR ended so many years back. I do miss the characters and the settings it transported some of us into.This time round, the story is that of one that should be more cheerful and it did accomplished that without being what the original book's intended target audience was, children. And quite fairly, I would have walked out at the first hint of this being made for children only.I shall not comment on the story in case it spoils it for everyone.In my opinion, as I've watched the high frame rate 3D version, it should have been done in higher frame rate at all. It made it looked like a very good HD cam movie made for TV.The effects, though are better, should not have been more realistic in the rendering of the backgrounds. It is so obvious most of the scenes looked like they were made in some colored screens.But overall, this is a good holiday movie to entertain both adults and children of a suitable age.",8,6,15,13 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Two Towers is only the 2ND part of a TRILOGY!
","To everyone who gave a negative review,Would you please comment sensibly? Look, this is the second part of a trilogy. You are really watching a 9-hour movie shown to you in 3 parts. All the character building is done in the first installment. The second movie is more to advance various characters' relationships and moving the story of the war further. Do you see the frailty of humans, dwarves and elves (who are supposed to be immortal)?? Do you feel the heroes clinging on to their hope in the impossibility of their situations? Do you see the variety of personalities that made up the people in Helm's Deep? The commoners? The warriors? The knights? The defenders of the weak? Or do you just see a story that has been dragged for 3-hours? I believe some are critical about how Peter jackson omitted out or changed certain portions of the story. People, he is trying to do his best to give us the best interpretation of the very lengthy and often long-winded story written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Believe me, going through the length of the 3 books was quite torturous (even though I think it is a modern classic). If he were to be as true to the books as some of you want it to be, he would probably be better off making the nine segments that made up the 3 books!! By then most of you would have lost much interest over some of the very exhausive and boring parts of the entire story.Be very grateful Mr Jackson has given us the best fantasy epic yet! Then think about this: can you do better?!",10,0,0,26 December 2002
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Where is the taste?
","I found the first film hugely overrated, despite going in with an open mind, knowing it is a girl flick. but at least I sat through the first one.For some reason, 1/2 an hour was the best I could get through the second.Explain to me, what's so 'hot' about the male leads? Edward has a flat face, and dog boy is just butt ugly. Granted the dog boy has a body, but that does not make him 'hot'. Whatever happen to the taste in men, girls? If it is not men with a body or a face, it is a gay. Where are girls with superficial tastes these days? Gosh....Then there's Kirsten Stewart.... Come on! Surely there are better looking chicks out there. For that matter the one playing Jessica is already better.I have been very disappointed in Hollywood's teen flicks these days, and this one just tops it off. I hope they didn't make enough to make a third one, but I would then be underestimating the power of the tastelessness of the target group these days.",2,7,9,5 March 2010
Clash of the Titans," Should this be compared to the original?
","I am fortunate to have survived to see both movies on their launch day. Given that I was still a young lad when the original premiered.I vaguely remember being awe-struck by the myriad of creatures and monsters in the movie. I was even covering my eyes when Medusa made her monstrous appearance in the original. This was the movie that led me on my life-long 'quests' to discover European and Middle-eastern mythologies.The cast, acting and sets were state of the art then (so was the stop motion capturing of various creatures). It was a blockbuster then and was much talked about in its time.Forward to April 1st, 2010.This movie struck me as a run-of-the-mill, CG-laden movie based on the original. This new one has a good cast, although most of the other Greek gods have little or no dialogue at all. they were just images that stand or sat there, like holograms. they have almost no interaction with each other or the mortals.CG in movies have reached an extent where it is no longer a novelty, but a must-have. Even so-called rom-com usually comes with various CGI touch-ups that we never really pay attention to. The creatures and environments created by CG, are pretty standard, even though they are well-designed.Acting is good all-round. The only person I detest in the movie was that doomsayer who coax people into giving in to Hades. I found the character to be over-acted and frankly, quite very annoying.However, the action sequences are well-choreographed and nicely edited. they were exciting enough to keep me from getting too comfortable with the back of my seat.However, I found the final fight to be some what disappointing. I was expecting sword-fighting sequences, but most of the time was dedicated to an aerial chase and the grand entrance of the Kraken.Overall, if you are looking for a Troy or Lord of the Ring, look elsewhere. This one is purely an adventure set in the Greek mythos with thin plot and story.",7,7,13,1 April 2010
The Dark Knight," I don't believe my eyes
","When the first Batman movie came out more tan a decade ago, I thought it was as expected. And the sequels actually got worse with each installment.Batman Begins gave me a breath of 'fresh' air as it went back to the roots and produce a darker and meaner Batman, one where Bob Kane would have been very proud of.I thought a sequel might be equal to or less than Batman Begins... Boy! Am I ever more wrong....This movie keeps its pace, not too fast, not too slow but everything keeps piling up, breaking down and piles higher again. Wow!!! All of Marvel's recent movies cannot even dream of matching half the success of this one. My goodness! I have seen a true translation of the Dark Knight.Enough of an old fan boy's ramblings.First, the plots and story. Like I have mentioned the plot keeps adding up even when you thought it was being broken down. However, do not expect a run-stop-run type of story pace. This is maintains a relatively steady pace, very unusual for an action movie. Expect the unexpected unless you are a fan of many years.Second, the acting. I am so glad they replaced Katie Holmes because I don't believe she will be able to handle the role this well. Ms Maggie Gyllenhaal, you showed us how to turn a relatively understated role into a good performance. I wish you could return in the sequel, but... sigh... So many good young actors in this movie that veteran actors, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, were outshone.A personal question to the late Mr Heath Ledger. Why did you have to die?!!!! I want to see your Joker again!! You were perfect as the Joker... no, you are the Joker! You've effectively given Joker his menace back and now, we will all be deprive of the return of this Joker. Your best work is your last. I salute you, but if you can please come back from wherever you are.... we want to see you in one of the sequels.Third, the director. Thank you.If anyone of you still have not watch this one, What the hell are you waiting for? Get off that seat and go watch a true masterpiece. I will remember this movie for years to come.",10,4,10,17 July 2008
Departures," Good movie, better music, lousy audience
","The bad first. I don't understand the Singaporean movie goers, are they all out to torture those who wants to enjoy the experience? Giggling girls, loud 40+ year old commentators, blinding active mobile screens, mobile ringing the 'Jive' (3x), and people talking loudly outside the 'plex' door. Are we still in the 70s? Can't be you all have got your cellphones. So please you paid for a ticket so did I and the rest of the audience. I would call these people inconsiderate, rude, insensitive and uncaring.The most memorable thing about the movie is no doubt the music. The pieces played are appropriately placed, soothing and calm with a touch of melancholy were needed. One of the best scores out of a movie, I reckon.The pace of the movie is kept fairly even throughout the film. However there is never a dull moment. The story is, in some places, mildly humorous but you'll not get anymore than a big grin out of it. You do have to remember you are watching a movie about a traditional Japanese funeral ritual. It underlines the taboo nature of the professional and how a rural community reacts to people like them.This movie gave me a how new respect to this traditions. I am not one who adhere to traditions and much less rituals.I will not dwell on the plots and story, so you can go into the cinema and enjoy this very well made movie.If you are those that can't turn off your precious cellphones, can't stop talking 'quietly' while the film is running, and/or if you cannot appreciate another culture's ritual and tradition, please spare the people who can and not go and watch this. Also if you are around the age of 15-22 and are very sexually active, also please stay out.",9,27,55,10 March 2009
Thor," One of the best comic adaptation
","Thor has always been one of my personal favorite among mythology. A warrior with a heart of gold, forever tormented by Loki the trickster and magician. Thus, Thor became one of the very first comics I've ever continually subscribed to, for an extended period of time. However, the stories in the series became kind of stale in the 90s, and so I stopped after much disappointment.The recent revival was great but I'm already over my addiction.This movie is very well made with plenty of strengths and little weaknesses found in so many comic adaptations. I watched the 2D version as I still can't stand 3D for all that hype about nothing.1. The cast is a strong one with strong character-actors, even among those with less important roles.2. CGI is realistic and not over the top. I just wish they would have made the Frost Giants' world less of a twilight zone.3. Loki was a great character. Instead of portraying him as the standard evil villain, he was made into a sad and jealous antagonist.4. Costumes and equipments were very well made, especially the armors and weapons. Will there be a life-size replica of Mjolnir? Why do they call it a hammer, when it is obviously a mallet? 5. Wasn't Sif supposed to have long golden locks?.....",9,51,102,1 May 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," Could be better... contains some spoilers
","Just watched it. I thought this movie could have packed quite a bit more punch into it. The special effects used are not unfamaliar to Matriz fans.The huge cave party scene is overly-long, and very unnecessary.. The intimate scene between Trinity and Neo is .... too tame... considering both of them wanted each other so much.Just a thought: If there were 6 versions of the Matrix, does that imply that the so-called real world to Neo and gang is a version/layer of the 6 versions of Matrix? The Architect seems to imply that each of the newer Matrix/program is built on top of the older one. In that case, I hope to they will show us what the real world really is beyond the Matrix.....Just a thought.",6,0,0,24 May 2003
Mystic River," Great acting full stop.
","Well, the cast is made up of some well-known character actors. I could not expect less of these great actors. However, like many others, I find the movie lengthy and slow paced. But when I think about it, the movie is like a grandfather telling a murder story between 3 estranged childhood friends. Perhaps many would not agree with me, but the pace and plot build-ups sure feels like it.Stripping away the many (somewhat) unnecessary details and all these great actors, you've just got a very simple story with a small twist in its ending. Then again, one could view this as art.... but not me.",6,0,0,23 November 2003
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Too fast too many
","One thing I realize after watching it half way through, there were so many Transformers that many of them were more like cameos.The plot is simple, as with the first one, the acting fair, the CGI is good. as expected, and the story well-paced.As an old fan of transforming robots back in the days of the good old Japanese animes, I think the 'bots in both of these movies are overly complicated, even for realism sake. They should have Shoji Kawamori do the designs for Star Scream (he looks like a flatten toad).The female lead lacks any sort of depth and is almost paper-thin as a character. All she portrays is the sex, nothing else. Heck! the dogs got more on-screen actions. The Australian, Isabel Lucas, had more steam screen than Megan Fox.Other than that this movie is worth your money.",8,1,4,26 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," What's all the rave about?
","This final installment to the prequels is probably, and at most, slightly better then the last two in terms of the story. The romance is still.... well, very conservative and mundane. I thought the dialogues at times, seemed to jump ahead, making it quite choppy. And the speed at which Anakin accept Palpatine's offer seems to be quite illogical. May be it is to speed up the progression of the film.Windu's death is quite a lackluster considering he is a Master Jedi.However, the story pace is much better, more consistently paced and faster than the last 2.As usual the graphics is among the best. They are more realistic than the last two. Yoda looks a lot more life-like and I especially enjoyed seeing General Grieve(?) moved from the animated series into the big screen. I would say that his animation is probably better than Yoda.",7,0,1,18 May 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," The end of the best adaptations of Batman
","I don't and won't usually give 10 to any one movie. There are always flaws. but the last of the Dark Knight trilogy is as close to it as one can imagine.Flow: The movie started slow, like a rolling stone gathering moss. It picks up speed and story almost every second you are watching it. You probably won't realize it until you have finished the entire film. What's relatively unusual is the fact that there is a good and smooth ending, where most movies rushed to end (like The Avengers, Iron Man, etc.).Plot: As expected, Nolan and writers have given much thought to entirety of the trilogy, rather than the single movie itself. You can link the stories together, although the movie can be watched on its own. The screenplay is well written and directions and editing well done. The plot is easy to follow, but doesn't treat the audience like a bunch of sex-starved teenagers (... like Avengers)Characters: Actors did a great job in giving an otherwise 2 dimensional comic personalities characters. Unlike what some are complaining about, I actually found the characters better than they were in the comics. One can relate to the characters in the movies, unlike Marvel movie-adaptations.All in all, if you are going to be comparing this movie to The Avengers, it is safe to say that you are not very objective. Marvel has always aimed at the younger audience. The Dark Knight trilogy has always been for the adults and young adults.Here I just want to thank Christopher Nolan for bringing this version of Batman to being, what the Dark Knight should always have been. during its time, the original Tim Burton version was great, but this is the best Batman yet.",10,4,12,19 July 2012
Iron Man," Not bad at all
","Fortunately, I'm not one easily influenced by some users' negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.Now I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.This movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.It's well worth its ticket price.",9,558,799,30 April 2008
Casino Royale," Nicely done!
","I cannot remember watching a better Bond film! Daniel Craig's acting is not as bad as I have envisioned at all! He may not be the best looking one of them lot, but he is very suitable for this role.One thing though.... A waste of a beautiful Italian actress! Guess her involvement is no longer as important as the previous Bond films where there are always a good Bond girl and a bad villain type.I like the story and the way they twitched it to reflect the present. whoever it was who made the comment on Singapore morning news about how the story's plot was mixed in the past and present obviously don't know much of the spoken English in the movie, or he wasn't paying attention to any of the conversations at all.Definitely a very good 'restart' of the Bond franchise. Can't wait to see the next installment.....BTW, I love the way the movie began in black and white for the Columbia Pictures and MGM's 'ad'... and of course, that old-style Bond opening with all the poker cards' symbols!",9,2,3,29 November 2006
X2: X-Men United," Over-rated sequel
","I have been a fan of X-men way back when it was still in color prints. But I believe the sequel deserve a better plot and storyline. I think all the subplots have come together rather loosely, and not streamlined at all.Both my wife (who is no fan of sci-fi) loved the first movie (especially Hugh Jackman for her), but think the second is just mediocre.So I do hope X3 is better planned and less like a unfinished jigsaw.",8,0,0,11 May 2003
Slumdog Millionaire," Where is all the rave coming from?
","I'll give you that the story is good as with the acting. The film's colors are probably one of the best I've seen, in an Indian dominated movie.However, have all the critics gone nuts? If you break it down, this is a very simple 2-3 tiered story involving a boy and his search for his love.The movie has put to frame some of the worst places and conditions on our planet and made it barely tolerable for the eyes to watch. The spoken language is English with very heavy Indian accents at times, but that is comprehensible. It is after all an Indian-centric cast and story.What I do find annoying, and not the fault of this movie, is the fact that everyone now tries so hard to make the Muslim's such victims. I mean we don't have to make them bad, but we certainly do not need to put them on the other end of the spectrum.A few odd-balls do not make the whole population bad or good.Growing up in a multicultural mix in Singapore, I've learn to appreciate each culture's good and quirks. I've also learn that the thing about Indian movies are the dances... it is what's unique about them. However, I don't really see a point for them in this day and age. That said, this movie have left only one dance sequence at the end and it is not obstructive. This is the point where people who cannot tolerate this sequence to leave the theatre. Nice touch for an optional dance.The actors are all pretty believable in their acting. Much to my surprise considering their ages. Seems Bollywood has come of age of late. Even the young ones are getting so good. Of course the veterans are important supporting casts, leading the young actors on the screen whenever they pop up. They are of course more natural at acting.I think this movie is worth the ticket you are paying to watch. However, I cannot understand the hype critics give it.",7,6,11,18 February 2009
