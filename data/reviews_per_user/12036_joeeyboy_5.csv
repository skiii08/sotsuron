The Avengers," Fantastic movie!
","'Avengers Assemble' has been smashing the box offices all around the world! It is tipped to be one of the highest grossing films of all time! The film has been strongly anticipated by 'Marvel' fans worldwide, who stuck on through the credits of the original character films to see 'Nick Fury' (played by Samuel L. Jackson) hint at the upcoming film.The film itself has certainly lived up to the hype, the cast is superb with an all star cast including; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L. Jackson and Gwyneth Paltrow. It also includes new up and comers; Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner and Tom Hiddleston.In the very beginning it is quite dull but it gets progressively better and better as it goes along! The cast all work together really well and there are tonnes of laughs and shining moments! Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man/Tony Stark) is definitely one of the shining stars. Downey Jr. and Johansson were the best of the bunch; they both did some fantastic acting and were absolutely hilarious! Chris Evans (Captain America/Steve Rogers) annoyed me because his character is very cocky and relatively boring yet he got quite a lot of screen time?The film has its up's and it has its minor down's but overall the film was fantastic and I really enjoyed watching it, I'm sure there will be a sequel, here's hoping it's as good as this!",9,6,14,5 June 2012
The Hunger Games," Intriguing plot, boring characters...
","The Hunger Games has been hotly tipped to be the new 'Twilight' or 'Harry Potter'. Unfortunately this just doesn't seem to be the case. The film isn't bad it's just that it really hasn't lived up to the hype that has been circulating it for months. I hadn't read the books but I was intrigued by the format, it's different and not like anything else at the moment.What I like about 'The Hunger Games' is that it really IS refreshingly different! It's not your average teenage novel turned movie; it's actually really quite interesting and it draws you in with the mystery and captivity of it all. It's intriguing to say the least and I found that I had to keep watching it.Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) shows little to no emotion throughout the film. Whether or not she's supposed to be like that is yet to be heard, all I know is that she was incredibly boring to watch. Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) is only OK and doesn't really bring anything to the film... Liam Hemsworth has been cast as one of the main characters (Gale Hawthorne) yet you see him about three times in the film? He has fewer lines than some of the minor characters and you barely see him at all throughout...Overall the film was pretty good; it had an all-star cast and an intriguing plot. It was let down by the cast who were really quite boring. It was also massively over hyped which doesn't help when someone is trying to be critical. I'm definitely going to be buying the books, not only because I'm curious to find out what's next but also because I just don't see how you could fashion a good sequel off the back of this film...",8,2,7,5 June 2012
Dark Shadows," I Just Don't Feel It Tim...
","When I first heard that Tim Burton would be directing 'Dark Shadows' I distinctly remember quite literally punching the air in delight! When the cast was announced for this film I was excited, finally a good vampire film and a good cast! Unfortunately 'Dark Shadows' lacks the 'oomph' that I thought Burton would surely provide...It gets off to a bad start with the film instantly jumping into the action, barely leaving any time for the development of the characters. This I believe is what lets 'Dark Shadows' down the most. The cast was impressive but some of the people who I most was looking forward to seeing (ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter & Michelle Pfieffer) were severely underused! The film focused mainly on Johnny Depp and Eva Green's characters and their story lines instead of developing the other characters back stories! This ends up leaving the viewer bored and restless, waiting for the plot to thicken or the characters to actually do something.While the film had a lot of downs it did also have its ups! Green did a magnificent job of portraying 'Angelique Bouchard' the cold, broken hearted witch with a bone to pick with Barnabas Collins (Depp). Pfieffer was excellent and was one of the strongest actors in 'Dark Shadows'. She managed to gel the cast together and provided a sense of humour and realism. Depp was a big let down, he could have done so much more with his character (Barnabas Collins) but unfortunately he just comes across as wooden. I had high hopes for Moretz - our latest rising star - but she just doesn't get enough screen time...Overall 'Dark Shadows' was average. With barely any character development you feel as if there needed to be more to the story. There were a few shining stars and funny moments but I expected far better from Tim Burton... Better luck next time maybe?",5,3,7,19 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Well Done Christopher Nolan.
","What a captivating end to Nolan's phenomenal trilogy. The Dark Knight broke box office records and I believe that this film will do just the same! From the very beginning I was drawn in and was pleasantly surprised to find that Anne Hathaway is a very very good Selina Kyle/Catwoman. I did have my doubts about her but within her first few scenes they immediately diminished. She is intelligent, witty and sexy and this was a real bonus for me. Hathaway was probably the best actor in The Dark Knight Rises.I thought that the fact the film is set 8 years on from the events of The Dark Knight would make it not as enjoyable but I was very very very very wrong! Its entirely relevant that it be set then, otherwise the story would have been nowhere near as good! Christian Bale reprises his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman with relish and really works hard to maintain the characters.Other new characters include Bane (Tom Hardy) seems the perfect counterpart to Batman! While many may remember Bane in Batman & Robin as Poison Ivy's mindless henchman in The Dark Knight Rises he is cold, calculating and brutally intelligent. Hardy does a fantastic job of portraying Bane and I'm sure if there ever was to be a reboot of the Batman films that included Bane, they would have to use Tom Hardy. Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who plays a newbie cop with a passion for saving lives and reawakening the Batman. Gordon-Levitt is a rising star and plays a really convincing part. Finally there is Marion Cotillard, she plays your regular damsel in distress who needs saving. Although towards the end you realise that she is a standalone character as her back story thickens. Cotillard seems quite boring and irrelevant in the beginning but towards the end it all becomes clear and you see that she has been doing some very good acting.And of course the return of the recurring cast includes Michael Caine as Bruce Wayne's ever trusting butler; Alfred Pennyworth, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and even Cillian Murphy as Dr Johnathon Crane/The Scarecrow for a brief moment!This film is truly amazing, it has an all star cast a captivating storyline and more twist and turns than a corkscrew!An amazing amazing amazing film! It truly rivals The Dark Knight. Well done Christopher Nolan, you should be proud of this...",10,3,8,21 July 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Was expecting more from a Wes Craven film...
","I saw this film was directed by Wes Craven, so I decided to give it a go seeing as one of my all time favourite films is Scream and he was the director for it. This film is classed as a Horror film and while the idea is quite a frightening one this is not a very scary film.I think the problem is that there simply isn't enough blood and violence, modern day horror is filled with it and that is what makes us jump. There are a few jump moments in this film but overall it is actually quite a dull film... I expected to not want to go to sleep ever again or something extreme like that but really it was just... Dull... Although this is the case, the acting is still very good, believable and strong. Most of the characters don't get developed enough throughout the film and this lets it down though. The cast is good and the story is original and well thought out. The execution of it all - sadly - does not live up to the hype...The ending was predictable and the rest of it was too, the shock moments that people desperately crave just weren't there. I'd recommend this if you're bored but don't expect to finish watching it and say 'Wow what a fantastic movie!' because it's not... I thought Craven would have directed this better but it is just another mediocre horror film...",6,1,2,5 June 2012
