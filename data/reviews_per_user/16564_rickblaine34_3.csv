Skyfall," Skyfall is not a real Bond movie
","Skyfall was probably the worst Bond movie I've ever seen, except for maybe Moonraker in which Bond actually goes to outer space - come on you cannot beat that in epic failures - and for On Her Majesty's Secret Service which ends with the villain shooting Bond's wife right after their wedding. (what was even more intolerable then the ending was George Lazenby's acting) It just didn't have enough content and material to be a movie, was more like a lenghtened episode from a spy series. As opposed to many, I did not like Javier Bardem as the villain, he can play a terrific villain if he wants to, look at No Country For Old Men, he just couldn't deliver here, still seemed to me like Juan Antonio Gonzalo from Vicky Cristina Barcelona, one of Bardem's finer hours. Skyfall is a celebration of all things British, it is a celebration of England actually and I don't have a problem with that especially since it is the 50 th anniversary of Bond, nothing wrong with returning to your origins and paying tribute to the old 007s. But have too much of that stuff and you just overdo it, turn the movie into half a documentary. All in all, Skyfall might be a nostalgic feel-good action movie especially for the Brits but it's not a real Bond movie.",6,6,15,5 November 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," One of the best movies of the year, if not the best. If you enjoy movies at all, don't miss out on this one.
","The Silver Linings Playbook is one of the warmest, one of the most sincere and the most heartfelt movies I have seen in my lifetime. A wonderful story about broken hearts, how to mend them and how to hold on to life, it will surely leave it's mark on you. The acting is out of this world, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper give what is easily the best performances of their careers. Sometimes the movie becomes an actors' showdown with all the breathtaking talent flying around. And it is, as always, a delight to watch De Niro just be De Niro. I can easily say that it is among the best pictures of the year and is one of the most inspiring movies ever made. If you enjoy movies at all, don't miss out on this one. A must see.",10,2,6,4 January 2013
Her," Spectacular
","'Her' is a modern day classic and one the best movies of the year. A work of creative and artistic genius, Jonze's sci-fi romance revitalizes a genre long dominated by CGI-filled popcorn movies. It has a melancholic charm to it. This movie is about a romantic relationship, no matter how out of the ordinary. But it can still give you this smooth, beautiful feeling of solitude, while portraying a relationship. I had the same feeling while watching Lost In Translation. The acting is spectacular. The casting was just right, everyone fits in perfectly to their role. The colours, the music, the cinematography, all perfect. It is so successful in that for a moment there it makes you feel such a relationship can actually be possible. It is so realistic that it makes perfect sense. This movie just carries you away. You won't believe how time has passed and you've reached the end, by that point you won't want it to be over. But unfortunately it is. More like this please Jonze. Simply spectacular.",10,0,2,15 February 2014
