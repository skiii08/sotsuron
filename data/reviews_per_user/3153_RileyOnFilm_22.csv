Your Name.," Very touching love story with sci fi elements.
","I really loved this film and that surprised me since I am not an anime fan in general. But, I am a love story fan. I was a little averse to the subtitles at first but once I started, it was easy to watch and really get into it. There are features in this film as deep as some of the most deep ones in American love stories and sci-fi. The concept draws you in immediately and if you pay attention, it starts to flow and flow and what a fun ride it is.It uses some elements we have seen in a new way and the anime really helps to that end. I have to tell you that after about 5 minutes in, I forgot the characters were animation, they seemed real to me.I found the two main characters charming. Again, I am not much of an anime fan. I have seen many of them but they aren't my first choice. This would not only appeal to young lovers, like maybe those in love for the first time, but it will also rekindle those adolescent/young adult feelings in anyone who gives it a chance.If you examine my history at IMDb or my own sites you'll see I am not new at recommending films. Take it from me, this is an instant classic. The artwork is also way above the usually anime bar. Some of the special effects had to be done by paintbrush, or by hand however they did it. It was a feast for the eyes and the story did not suffer.Having said all that, if you can't give it your attention or you really have no interest to sit and watch subtitles, this probably isn't for you.Give this film your full attention as a love story with some sci fi elements and you will not regret it.",8,5,8,21 November 2017
Deepwater Horizon," Another high budget film destined for the1/2 price DVD bins
","The names are big and the effects are great. Still, Deepwater Horizon felt too much like a made-for-TV movie with a destination of a Wal-Mart patriotic bin. It was rated highest on RT of all the movies currently in my theaters. So, I took a chance.I learned terms I never knew before tonight. Inlets, outlets, relief valves, and the like. I also learned there are oil tankers that remain somewhat stationary and pump loads of black oil from the ocean floor. This movie chronicles the events of the largest oil spill in US history but fails to present the gravity of that. This is true even after a 110,000 m dollar budget.",6,3,5,28 October 2016
Us," More a Sci-Fi than Horror, Original.
","Being a horror fan first and foremost I try to be thankful for any horror that is released. I don't always like them though. This was a film about a failed government experiment on cloning. That in and of itself is a cool idea for a movie. When one of the dopplegangers says 'We are Americans' it opens up much potential for interpretation. What isn't as cool is that Peele leaves it up for interpretation 100%. Horror shouldn't be so hard to figure out. Furthermore, at the end Adelaide has a flashback and realizes she has been the doppleganger all along. This is really a reach in the writing. I wish Peele would have kept it more simple than that. Horror makes complicated turns difficult. Instead of bracing for a scare, you're trying to figure stuff out and for me tonight as I watched the film, that was definitely not cool. I didn't hate it, but I felt numb about it. So much cliche and so much of the same tropes he used in his first horror 'Get Out.'I would like to see Peele do some drama etc based on race. That is the strained topic of both his movies. Why not just let horror be horror and make those statements in a drama or sci-fi social consciousness umbrella. There was little to no character development in either film because they posed as horrors which usually don't have that. If his next is horror, I think I am twice bitten thrice shy. I'll probably miss it.",2,7,13,23 March 2019
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Romantic Humor with Sword and Sandal Action
","This Jerry Bruckheimer production truly 'brings it.' On the heels of Pirates of the Caribbean, this mega-producer was able to produce another highly entertaining Summer swashbuckler for Disney. It is partially based on the popular video game of the same name.Jake Gyllenhaal (Jake from here on out) plays Dastan, a street rat who becomes a prince. Sound familiar? No, actually other than that there are no parallels to Alladin. He obtains a dagger that is able to rewind time one minute in duration. Naturally everyone wants this dagger so he must keep it safe. Gemma Arterton is the beautiful princess who is charged with the task of getting it back from him. Dastan wrongly believes she wants HIM and not the dagger, as every prince probably would, but he is mistaken. Their romantic comedy banter back and forth is some of my favorite stuff from this film.There are a couple of actor heavyweights in the film as: Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina. They bring a stoic feeling to the film. Both are very physical in the film, along with Jake. They appear to do many of their own stunts including Alfred Molina's harrowing scene when he kisses an ostrich. I understand these are mean animals and yet, they manage to be ridden in the film without the use of CGI. Quite amazing if you asked me.The film looks like a sword and sandal epic but feels just short of it at times. It isn't a bad movie but it's not as good as The Gods of Egypt or The 300. The story is a bit complex and I think could have been more engaging if it were whittled down and simplified a bit. Despite poor reviews and some stale audience periods, It did gross over 300 million dollars so something definitely is there that kept people swiping their cards and slapping down bills at the box office. I would recommend this film for fans of Jake or possibly the video game (I've never played it) but only after you've seen everything else he's done. I think you'll find it a lot of fun in a branched off performance for him.",6,2,3,30 October 2016
Spotlight," Sort of Beating a Dead Horse at 2 hours but Definitely a Great Message
","We have a system of law that is faulty. We also have a system of the free press which is flawed. Put them together and you have a flawed but highly capable system, more so than any other I know of in the world. It was great but sort of beating a dead horse after a time. This movie is about the free speech/reporting side. We see reporters acting as humanitarian heroes. For so long, no one said anything about this perversion of the church. These reporters get more and more to the core of reporting it, they just can't stop. It is exciting to watch and feel a part of in real time. Another film that could easily be the film of the year. If you're a human who feels things, go see it!",8,0,0,10 December 2016
The Hateful Eight," I Don't Give it an 8
","Spaghetti westerns and blood soaked pulp violence films, yeah! Bring 'em on. Quentin has put these together for us for many a year and many people thank him for it with their admission dollars. But is this particular film one of his best yet? Let's take a look.One new thing is the bonking a woman on her head until blood runs down her toothless face. Are we meant to enjoy this? I think so. It's pretty funny but not a laugh a minute.The premise of the film is bounty hunters and thieves traveling across frozen terrain to cross paths in a warm cabin. In there is where all hell breaks loose and the stuff starts to hit the fan.I've seen worse gore and violence in a Tarantino film. It doesn't knock you over the head that way. For me, this one was more dark comedy than anything else. It moves around a bit in time which makes it interesting. You'll get mostly what you get in his other films. In fact, there isn't much here we haven't seen before, in spades.I think the hallmark of a great film is one that draws influence from previous ideas but integrates them into a new idea. The 'new' of it is missing in this film for me.As a final thought: I'm a die-hard fan of Tarantino's work but this one only gave me a few moments by the fire only to leave me cold.",6,1,2,13 December 2016
Doctor Strange," Seriously good but could use more humor
","This film is very good. The visuals are probably the best feature but it has a solid cast, good acting, and a very able hero to add to the Marvel film universe. There were several times I lost interest in the characters and what they were doing, a better story with more aside type humor might have helped that.This film is serious, that's for sure. It starts out with a doctor making life or death choices in surgery. From there is transfers to Hong Kong and the focus is on learning martial arts and a Zen mindset. My 9-year- old found these parts very boring. To me, they were OK in that they were part of the machine of telling the story. I did think those scenes could have been eliminated in retrospect.There is a villain and he is certainly hated and scary. It is unclear where he gets his powers though and so he seems flat. It would be nice to get more back story on him. The visuals, mostly CGI, are stunning and they really drew me in. This idea of 'folding in' dimensions one upon another is hypnotic and this part of the story is told well.Tis film is very polarized on its hero. I would have liked to see his relationship with his colleague/lover developed. This could have opened our minds more to his motivation. As it is, the first half of the movie is basically just life events that lead up to the car accident. The second half is him flailing to find a way to make his hands stop shaking. That is the only motivation in the film really.There is a lot of action here. If you want something visually stunning, Doctor Strange is for you. Some viewers might find the focus on training a bit long but there is plenty of action here as well. I guess I would have liked to see this film 'get to it' sooner but then again, I am not familiar with the comic book storyline. I would definitely recommend this film to Marvel comic fans and those interested in Eastern meditation, martial arts, and the Doctor Strange character.",7,1,2,22 November 2016
The Revenant," Another Iñárritu masterpiece to follow 'Birdman.'
","Director Alejandro González Iñárritu, known most recently for directing 'Birdman,' has created a visually stunning movie of survival and revenge. It's clearly the fruit of much labor on behalf of the director and all the actors. It shows and works in the movie. Unfortunately the audience has to labor as well through a lot of slow scenes, some of which are probably unnecessary.The two main roles are played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. Their characters are rough, gritty, and at times difficult to watch. There are some scenes in this film that made even me feel like hiding my eyes. Is this any surprise since this movie is about frontiersmen surviving in sub zero temperatures. There are Indians, hatchets, musket type rifles, buffalo, and bears. Aside: This film contains the most frightening bear maul I've ever seen on film. Even Paul Bunyan would recoil.Short synopsis: Hugh Glass is a frontiersman alongside Jon Fitzgerald and a group of rough ones. They are making their way through the snowy forest terrain. Through a course of events and a bear mauling of Hugh, the story becomes one of survival. Hugh is determined to survive the attack and take revenge on those who abandoned him for dead.My conclusions: There is a signature drum soundtrack but not as extensive as the one in 'Birdman.' The camera pans and zooms are also signature of Iñárritu. It's a long sit but I can say that fans of 'Birdman' and westerns about revenge will probably really enjoy this movie. The cinematography is incredible. My wife and I actually felt cold in some of the scenes even though we had a raging fire going with the heater on. Movie lovers and reviewers especially will enjoy this movie. I foresee Oscar nods. It's one of the best of 2015 for sure. I did find it overly long and belabored at times though and that made it lose a star with me.",8,0,2,26 December 2016
Bridge of Spies," Cinematic Gold
","'Bridge of Spies' is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. For some these days, that may not be persuasive enough to buy a ticket so let me say it is crafted to make a historical event come alive on screen. It stars Tom Hanks but doesn't rely on his huge appeal. Hanks lets the story play out on its own without grandstanding with his character. There's an excellent cast with him and they all work together to make this film amazing.There is so much to enjoy here. It's first of all interesting because it is a true story. Second, it heralds the accused's right to a solid defense. There is much here about negotiations in and out of country. It's also a period piece replete with authentic props and there is a remarkable conclusion one may or may not expect.'Bridge of Spies' is top notch storytelling about an event that should be remembered from the cold war. A couple questions are addressed:How can people thought of as evil make grand gestures of humanity? Why should we put effort into defending the rights of those such as a foreign spy?There are parts of those questions that require a long telling so the length of the movie may put off some. I was bored at times but I kept regaining interest. If one can keep ones attention span alive between the slower scenes, 'Bridge of Spies' has many engaging moments and a most intriguing payoff. This is yet another in the sequence of movies I've been reviewing lately that definitely could win movie of the year. It is a story told by Spielberg worth watching.",10,1,2,26 December 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Meh, not what I hoped for
","Captain America appears once again in a movie with his name as the banner. Strangely however, a legion of other stories and superheroes weave through this film and it watches more like the next Avengers film. Cap has a backseat purpose.Comic books are fun, but they're hard to get and I mean that on two levels. A good comic book tells a story in 2 dimensions. A good movie made from a comic book, transfers that 'good stuff,' for example the story and superheroes, and translates that into a movie experience. Because I read a lot of reviews, I can see there is an either/or in comic book movies: some say they stayed true to the comic and the movie excelled as a result. The other one is when a comic book connoisseur slashes and trashes the director for taking too much license in the making o the movie. I don't know comic books well, which might explain why I didn't like this film as much as the critics as large. Maybe I should read more comics?My first question was: 'Why so many superheroes when this is a movie called 'Captain America?''I binge watched the two prequels to Civil War before seeing it at the cinema, as did my wife. I can tell you the first two really held my attention and Cap (as he is called in all of them) is the focal hero of the movies. That made it a lot easier to follow and get on board with. Civil War has too many superheroes exhibiting their individual strengths and weaknesses.All the while there is a ploy by politicians to gain control of the Avengers due to their reckless modus operandi. Cap's reins from the other two movies is named 'Bucky' and I don't want to give any spoilers but there is so much back story and attention given to him you might as well have named it 'Bucky: Civil War.' Still, he has some interesting abilities and his interplay with Cap is somewhat interesting. I'd call that part of the story 'just above a snore.'We do get to see some action. There is an almost unforgivable about of people having dialog and no action. This to me was a crime. All I can imagine is that it would make more sense if I only read the comics. Because I felt the movie did not live up to its name 'Captain America' and should have been named 'Avengers,' and because of some laboriously long dialog with no action, it lost two stars with me. I have to say, enough comic book aficionados will go see this no matter what I say but to all the others I cannot recommend this film. I have high hopes for the next one though.",6,1,2,26 December 2016
The Conjuring 2," Meet the Warrens ... again. True story, creepy horror.
","From scares like a creepy toy that plays 'The Crooked Man' to a phantom nun with yellow eyes, the Conjuring 2 will please horror fans many times over. Furthermore, I hope a third sequel gets made soon!Like its predecessor, this movie features a story about the Warrens. In real-life, Ed Warren was a WWII Naval officer who, after the war, became a self-taught demonologist alongside his wife Lorraine who is a self- described clairvoyant among other titles. They are highly documented investigators of the paranormal. Ed is the only non-ordained demonologist, or one who performs exorcisms, recognized by the catholic church. They have published many of their famous investigations and claim to have done tens of thousands of them. In the film, Patrick Wilson plays Ed and Vera Farmiga plays Lorraine. The movie is based on their experience with The Enfield Poltergeist.Director James Wan is well known for scaring moviegoers. His Saw and Insidious franchises have netted hefty sums from the wallets of people looking for that thing they've never seen before. He's a master craftsman of the horror genre. There isn't nearly as much blood and gore in The Conjuring 2 as you will find in Saw movies. Still, there are well crafted scares throughout. A spinning toy that sings 'The Crooked Man' is part of one scare that has stayed with me.Vera Farmiga does an excellent job as Lorraine Warren. You can see in her eyes and movement she has such a profound love and respect for her husband. When he picks up the guitar at one point to bring some peace and music to the haunted place, she is just as captivated with him as the daughters are. It's interesting how Ed in many ways is the hero of The Conjuring 2. When I saw the first film, I didn't know he was a real person. Knowing a little about Ed Warren's history helped me appreciate him immensely in the second film. There is a lot of info on the internet and the Warrens even have their own website that is still up today. Ed has passed on but Lorraine is still with us. She speaks about her paranormal experiences at various events. This film concerns the possession of a young girl and how her family saves her with the help of the Warrens.conjuring1There is no doubt there will be another sequel since there are other stories about the Warrens that remain to be told. I think the first two in the franchise are both very scary horror movies with interesting real- life foundations. Because I was shocked and thrilled, The Conjuring 2 loses no stars from me. I highly recommend it to horror fans.Below is a real treat, an interview with the Hayes Brothers, the writers of the 2 Conjuring films.",9,0,0,22 November 2016
Inside Out," Cool Trailer Cooler Movie
","There are movies that need no introduction because you can tell from the trailer they are cool. Inside Out was cool out of the gate. Judging my the packed in house on a Monday night when I took my family to see it, people agree it's cool. There's something about a simple concept brought to the screen or television with a gang of hella talented people that wins the crowd every time. I compare it to Seinfeld that way. It has a simple premise: a little girl's mind going through the challenges of school and moving. Her mind is where the characters are and they produce some hilarious if not downright profound discussion material.Without giving any of its delights away, I will tell you there are two platforms the movie switches back and forth from: the little girl's mind and the real world she's in. It heartwarming, suspenseful, enlightening, and entertaining the way they portray her emotions. We get her from the inside-out: emotions first, real world second. It's an excellent movie for kids because it opens up conversations on fear and anxiety, which as we know children feel from both small and big events in their lives. It's also quite fitting as a date movie or if you're just out with a friend. I always like movies that shine a light on the human condition and don't preach. These sort of movies allow the viewer to pour themselves into the questions and draw their own conclusions. In this case those experiences will be childhood and adulthood.",10,9,36,29 June 2015
Insidious," Understated, modest budget, horror at its best
","A movie critic cohort on my blogroll, Darren at Movies 101, pointed out to me yesterday that 'Insidious' had a ridiculously low budget of just 1.5 million. We were discussing it in context with a film he was reviewing with a small budget as well. It is true that money can buy an awesome production but there is still a lot to do with a little money. Insidious definitely fits in that category.There is no set criteria for a great horror flick, in my opinion. I rate them based on what they try to be and let me say this, it's fairly easy to detect what a horror movie is trying to be. There are 'Saw' formulas and others for movies like 'Paranormal Activity.' I'd say there are probably a handful of classic themes/formulas and two handfuls of ones that have emerged in the past 20-30 years. Insidious follows the formula of cheap camera scares and ingenious sound effects and they are used well. Everything else in the film, including ghosts, is minimal. The creepiest scene in my opinion could have been aired on the Twilight zone in the 1960's.There may be minor spoilers the rest of the review. That doesn't mean it's not graphic. It's far less so than 'Saw,' which was made by the same people, but it's not for very small kids like 0-7. Still, it is a minimal movie that relies on the creepiness of strobe like scares and a ghost story that really never goes anywhere  until the end. I loved the end. There is a twist that made me smile for sure. If you're looking for a great horror movie without the gore and not as much stuff jumping out as 'Paranormal Activity,' this is a fun one to get your blood going. I didn't like some of the writing choices. For example: I thought the boy came into the house with a feeding tube far too quickly after being in the hospital. I also thought the story was way too slow and not much was developed until a certain point. It could have 'gotten to it' much earlier for my taste. For that reason I took off just one star and still rated it very high as a great horror film.",10,1,2,22 November 2016
A Quiet Place," Incredible, great, and few other hundred dollar adjectives
","My score: 10/10. Depeche Mode sang, 'Enjoy the silence.' But I really don't think anyone in this film is enjoying it. We are programmed to yell out when hurt, scared, or shocked. What would you do if that spelled your demise? This is the question I kept asking in in 'A Quiet Place.' Listen to my 7 min review at the player below:John Krasinski is our director and a great one indeed. This is a film of 90 minutes that I literally wanted to be a lot longer. Trust me, my patience for long movies is characteristically low. In this case, it was done so well, I wanted to know what the characters did after the first credits appeared. That doesn't mean I am asking for a sequel by the way, far be that from me. The central premise of being hunted by sound is powerful and it works so well. After that, the foreshadowing and character development worked together to make this film amazing. Tip of the hat to Krasinkski, who also plays the dad/husband of this family. I am utterly impressed with his work here.A lot of times these days in films, directors use the rule of less is more when it comes to their monsters. They only show parts of the monster ad then the audience uses their far more powerful imagination. We are given the 'full creature' in many scenes and this really makes the film work. We have an idea what it can do and maybe how it can be destroyed. Needless to say I am very impressed also with the CGI of this film. This is mostly because it serves the story.I kept thinking in this film I was in 'Signs.' It was like the same barbecue with different meat. Signs is more of a metaphysical/religious film whereas this one is just suspense all the way. The ending of both are birds of a feather and both films have amazing writing that makes the film worthy.The acting is equally astounding. Metacritic has given this film an 85 and I must say I disagree. This film should be closer to 100. Millicent Simmonds (Wonderstruck) steals the show. All cast members deserve awards but her work as the deaf loving daughter broke my heart and I am sure everyone else's in the theater as well. She was amazing and I await great things from her in the future.Emily Blunt pays the mother with so much to lose if the creatures hear her. You feel her tedium. Noah Jupe is the brave young brother who knows what to do in the cse of a creature attack. This is labeled horror but it's a lot about family and sacrifice. It's suspense above all and though it starts a bit slow, patient audiences will be rewarded. In case you couldn't tell, I recommend this film and give it a 10/10.",10,2,4,14 May 2018

Jurassic World," Pretty much like the first but way more magical effects
","Fans of the original Jurassic Park are likely to love this one. There isn't much new in the way of a twist though. I remember the build up back when the first came out, people came out to the movie in droves. It really was like waiting in line for a ride. It was an original idea my Michael Crichton and everyone wanted to see the giant lizards. It was basically three things that made that movie popular: 1) The dinosaurs, 2) The action, and 3) the story. On all three levels I still give the first one a 5/5. This new one is good, very good. It is a rollicking rode for sure and worth the price of a ticket. At the same time it really lacks in the story department. I went in hoping to get something new and fresh that made me think about dinosaurs. In between the guttural dinosaur special effects, it just isn't there.Having said that, I doubt moviegoers really care about that. The dinosaurs and there, in full tech regalia. I've always thought dinosaurs were cool. I like to watch them but in real life they aren't there. I even think museum bones are a bit boring now thanks to this franchise. I felt the need to explain to my 8 year old that dinosaurs were extinct. It seems kids in the past 20 years have seen them so much on the silver screen, they seem real. I loved the movie, I offer no spoilers except to say you're gonna love the dinosaurs and the action. Some stories don't need to be improved upon, maybe that's what the makers of this Jurassic Park were thinking.",8,1,6,29 June 2015
Arrival," Way Way Over Hyped. Not Sci Fi.
","I sort of have a degree in linguistics. My MA is in English with an emphasis in 'language, writing, and rhetoric.' I enjoyed Amy Adams' character in this film as a linguist. I have reservations about nearly all the rest of this popular film.My wife and I just saw this last night on opening night at an antique theater in Santa Barbara. Please be warned:The rest of my review contains spoilers.Fans of Interstellar may enjoy Arrival most. It has to do with time and getting outside it. I personally feel this has been beaten like a dead horse in movies. Here, Villanueva uses the theme in attempt to 'Ooh and Ahh' audiences once again, in my armchair opinion.It didn't move me.Amy Adams plays a linguist and single mother who has a daughter who dies of cancer. Forest Whittaker commissions her to translate an alien message. It climaxes when she realizes that language determines how you see reality and therefore because she learns the alien language, she is outside of time. She then realizes she married a guy she works with and had her daughter but after sharing all this with her husband, he doesn't 'look at the daughter the same way,' assuredly because he knows she will die.The big idea is to choose to have the daughter with her short life even if you know she is going to die. Carpe diem.In short, there are so many effects like the gravity of the space 'stones' that are never explained. I wasn't impressed with the aliens nor with the whole 'a language makes me see through time' concept.It was just OK. I was moderately entertained. Mostly, in the daughter/mother scenes and flashbacks, I was glad I had popcorn and red vines for distraction. I recommend this film for people who have lost someone too soon and fans of Interstellar. Too bad, this could have been a science fiction film as advertised.",4,8,17,11 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Surprised at How Good This Was
","Apart from misleading marketing, even down to the very title of the film, 'Batman v Superman' is an amazing film that audiences are sure to continue enjoying. The critics at large have dismissed its genius but time will take care of that.I've gone around and around with it in my head and decided I just can't take points from a movie because it was named and marketed poorly. Honestly though, that's the only thing wrong with this film. It shines. My nearly eighteen year old son said it dragged at the beginning and was laboriously long but we both agree the mid to end portion is spectacular I thought the whole movie was stellar.Without giving any spoilers, let me just say the title should have been something like: 'Superman 2: Luthor rises.' This is really a Superman film with the usual nemesis Lex Luthor who uses rhetoric to persuade Batman to kill Superman. Does he succeed? Yes and no. You'll have to see the film. There is some other stuff in the plot I'd love to talk about. It's a grand scale monster we hear nothing about in the trailers. In my opinion, the monster and Lex are really what this movie is all about.Ben Affleck plays a great Batman, which many of us felt he would. There is also the debut of the DC character Wonder Woman in the latter part of the film. This was briefly explained. In fact, the intro to her coming on screen was so minuscule, I have to go back and watch it again to get where she came from etc. It was a long and involved film so please forgive me. I didn't bring my notepad, a mistake that will not happen again.Another thing that maybe could have taken a star from my 5 star rating of this behemoth, beautiful film is the insertion of histories, mostly on Batman. Now we all know Bruce Wayne's parents were killed in front of him as a child. Scenes like this and others are plentiful in the early part of the film. I would have rather they not be, they aren't relevant. Still, this film picks up and gets you on a ride that all you're thinking is 'I can't wait to tell my friends about this.' Don't believe the critics on this one. I found it much preferable to the critical darling 'Deadpool.' I highly recommend it.",9,6,9,26 December 2016
Minions," Pretty Funny Movie, Not Amazing
","This minions is great as usual for its jokes and slapstick comedy with the world's funniest tube-like creatures since the Weebles. It's visually amazing, which one would expect from Illumination pictures but lacks a good story akin to the first Despicable Me film in the series. Many will argue that a good story doesn't matter for the Minions to be entertaining. This is mostly true. Perhaps it's because the film came out running neck and neck with amazing storied films like Inside Out and Home. I wanted to get into the story at least a little bit. I really had no interest in the story of the Minions. It has many holes in it and so much is left unexplained. For example, how long do they live and are these the same ones we see with Gru that are with the T- Rex?The film works as a set of short films, if taken that way. I think it would have been better to leave out the history and the evil villain played by Sandra Bullock. Watching the little guys hit and slap each other is fun without any need for an underlying story. The one provided is so fragmented and under-developed, it's hard to stay focused on the proved comedy of the Minions.I wanted to say I liked this film more than all the reviewers saying it's awful. I can't really recommend it as amazing. This, the slapstick stuff everyone loved is there even in the absence of a decent story. Hopefully animation movie makers will try and get a powerful story along with stunning visuals. They go hand in hand for truly great films.",7,6,9,19 July 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Amazing Action, Not About Max
","It did well with critics but it's not without its detractors. I had read it was a class A action movie and on that basis alone I was excited to see it. I saw Mad Max in high school so I was aware of the character and the austere Australian cult vibe of the movie. This new version was only alike in costumes. The dialog was minimal but there were some heavy themes present. The evil leader gets his minions to blow themselves up by explaining some sort of after death paradise. Modern parallels anyone?The movie is not from the perspective of Max this time. We see a lot from a group of women who get pregnant and supply their milk to the group for nourishment. I'm not entirely sure how helpful this was to the plot. It did, however, show by proxy that they had lost civilized conventions ... like cow's milk. The chases and shoot em up scenes are top notch. I wasn't bored once. The movie really is just one long car race and gang war. If you saw the trailer, you know about the flame thrower guitar. I wondered why that would be there but them recalled how in the revolutionary war the soldiers wee often led by flutes and drums. By the way, in addition to the wicked guitar flamethrower, there are some amazing drums on the cars. So often action movies get caught up in storytelling scenes. Max avoids that. It's just one long running action scene with pointless dialog from time to time and in between. Because it didn't focus on Max very much and because the story was a little weak it lost points. As an action movie, I think it will take its place in history as one of the best.",7,1,5,19 July 2015
Sully," After I said, 'That's what the hype was all about?' Weak film.
","Tom Hanks once again plays an average American and gives the world someone to believe in. Captain Sully is a decorated pilot who has to crash-land an airplane in the Hudson river. It's a compelling story for sure but some viewers may find it dull and mundane. If you were ever curious about what happened in this news story, filmmaker Clint Eastwood has a video tale to tale you.To borrow from David Spade: I liked this movie better when it was Flight. One thing I notice with older film makers like Clint Eastwood is that they tend to make movies they think will make a historical contribution. This is admirable but be advised these types of films are often not exciting. In fact, they can be quite boring.There is great acting in this film but that's not enough to justify this story being a movie. I think a TV special would have been a better suited genre. I did like the ending, it surprised me. When the panel somehow had a paradigm shift and suspended all judgment of Sully, it was gratifying. Just like in Flight, he is in a lot of trouble the entire length of the film. Unfortunately for me, I feel the story dragged on and I just didn't find the science that makes up at least 50% of the investigation and the movie interesting. I can't recommend this film for anyone but that's not to say pilots and fans of the real sully won't like it.",5,8,15,22 November 2016
The Martian," Wasn't Bored Once
","Films made from novels are usually great in my opinion. I think screen writing a story without a famous novel behind it may be fading by convention. 'The Martian' is one of those hip cool novel-to-movie examples. I read the first few chapters before seeing the movie. The understated humor and NASA space themes drew me in right away. That and the universal praise of the critics put seeing this one at a high priority.'Star Wars' proved a global love for space movies. 'Castaway' did the same for survival films. It's likely 'The Martian' draws from both audiences along with readers of the novel. It's already being given 'Blockbuster' status in the press. In the story, a manned mission to Mars goes wrong and an astronaut, thought to be dead, is left behind. He uses his ingenuity and tenacity to survive. The movie is well over 2 hours and I wasn't bored once.",9,1,3,10 December 2016
