The Blair Witch Project," Not that scary really.
","With all the hype surrounding this film you would expect God himself to make an appearance.  Unfortunately there is a 'is that all' feeling at the end. It's not a bad film, just not as good as I was expecting.  That wonderfully modern clich√© about being impossible to live up to the hype obviously applies here.The thing is, with all the back-story of how it was made this is a very interesting story.  If possible you should really check out the Director's commentary on the DVD edition, it really is worth the effort.  The problem is that to review the film you have to forget about this.  What you're left with is an above average film, which promises a lot for its crew's futures.The three actors are all functional; Heather Donahue really excels though and deserves to go further than this.  She is probably the best reason to watch this film other than the making-of story.  Anyhow, give it a blast, it seems people either love it or hate it, somehow I've fallen somewhere in the middle.",7,0,1,13 January 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Bit funny, though......
","This really does feel like a movie that was born from a television show.  It feels dragged out and you spend too much of your time in this film waiting for something to happen.  The annoying thing is that when it does it is usually very funny (I say usually because there is only so many times you can laugh at the 'f' word) and you feel that the film could have been so much better.It is far too concerned in being controversial.  Trey and Matt seem like little boys with a new toy in their overuse of things that they couldn't get away with on regular T.V.  The prime example is the now unbleeped swearing. Also, they need a stronger plot for a film; it needs to last a lot longer than the T.V. show so the plot and characters need to progress.  Problem is that Trey and Matt are very good at being mildly funny but not at writing that vital plot.  Therefore, too much of the film is dead time which is reallllllly dull.It's a petty as I was expecting more, possibly naively due to the previous Parker/Stone films. 5/10",5,0,2,15 January 2000
The Game," Why, why the end?
","This is a good film, trust me you will probably enjoy it.  For the first hour it is fantastic, things change and twist and skew...love it.  Problem is that the end is so ridiculous.  Hitchcock kept something up his sleeve, but it was always believable and improved the film.  This the final hour does not do this. Don't get me wrong, this is an above average film, it just could have been so much better. David Fincher fans go and have a blast, but be warned, it isn't a patch on Fight Club or Se7en.  But it is good fun; it just tries to be too smart in the one twist too far finale.  It'll keep you guessing though.",7,0,1,11 January 2000
Toy Story," Fun for all the family - really this time!
","The phrase 'fun for all the family' usually means that grown-ups can expect to wish they'd watched something else.  This film is one of the rare beauties that does blend attractive visuals for the kids and a witty, funny script for the adults.  Throw away your expectations of a Disney movie, this is a step in the right direction for more 'mature' viewers who still want to keep the young ones happy.  And we all know how pretty the film looks.  It really is a joy literally just to watch.  But the jewel in the film's crown is the sharp dialogue.  I challenge you not to laugh and Tim Allen's wonderfully self-centred Buzz Lightyear.  And his voicing is just one gem in a great cast.",8,1,1,11 January 2000
The Matrix," Who cares what the Matrix is, enjoy the action.
","This film almost literally kicks you in the teeth to gain your attention. Forget about all the blue pill/red pill, 'What is the Matrix' nonsense, which is all just a badly plotted excuse for some action.  And that is where the film excels.The camera work and effects blend together beautifully, sweeping around people in the air and such like.  The dialogue is wonderfully cheesy at times ('We need guns, lots of guns') but you really forgive all flaws when the music kicks in and the next big action scene begins.There is one flaw too far though: Keanu Reeves really is awful, he couldn't act hurt if you kicked him in the groin.  This is the main annoyance about an otherwise good-if-you-can-remove-your-brain sort of film.  Also, remember, if your watching this at home expect to be disappointed unless you have a good sound set-up, it really isn't the same otherwise.",8,0,0,13 January 2000
