The Devil's Advocate," Evil Pacino
","The movie might be a bit contrived, but seeing Pacino as the devil is well worth it.  The film also makes a bold statement regarding the vanity of humans as the most horrendous sin of all. If you are looking for a good Saturday Night date movie, and are a Pacino /Reeves fan...look no further.",Null,0,1,13 August 1998
