","From the jaw-dropping animation, splendid visuals ,the amazing background scores, this is something every movie lover should watch. Being a fan of Shinkai's work , I expected nothing less and believe me, this movie will not disappoint!!!I originally mistook it for another teen movie but the unique and amazing story evoloves into much more over the course of the film.The characters are well defined and likeable.The visuals are amazing, breathing life into the tiniest of details. I don't want to go much into the story. I assure you,this movie will entertain you with its special humor. Just go watch it !!!!",10,0,0,31 January 2019
