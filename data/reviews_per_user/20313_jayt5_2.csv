The New World," The worst movie that I actually sat all the way through
","I think maybe Bob Longino of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution sums it up best: '...more an ethereal cinematic tone poem than plot-driven story.' This could be why I stayed the hell away from English as much as possible in college. And decided to become a biologist. Damn close to three hours of little dialogue, little action, but a lot of highlights. And by highlights, I mean Colin Farrell's hair. It kept getting lighter and lighter streaks. About an hour and a half in, when I realized that nothing was going to happen any time soon, I started to get very bored. By the time Pocahontas died at the end, I was practically cheering for Death. It didn't matter whose--Pocahontas', the writer/director's, mine...They went on into this collage of the sky and junk like that, while we were just hoping for the damn movie to be over. I glanced over at the two friends, who were trying not to laugh. Which of course, made me crack up. But no one else seemed to be, so I had to try to keep myself from filling the theater with it. Didn't really work. But I believe I set off some other UCLA students.It may not be the worst movie I've ever seen (I believe that dubious honor goes to 'Freddie Got Fingered'), but I would definitely go so far as to say it was the worst movie that I actually sat all the way through.",1,6,17,21 January 2006
The Ugly Truth," Abby hates the Mike's chauvinistic public access show, The Ugly Truth. The next day, she learns he has been hired to help the ratings of her morning news program.
","Heigl plays Abby, an idealistic 'control freak' producer of a Sacramento morning news show with sagging ratings (it was beaten out by a rerun of Who's the Boss) across from Butler's Mike, a jaded misanthropic host of a public access show. When he's brought in to rescue the show, Abby isn't exactly happy. Mike makes her a deal--he will help her nab the doctor of her dreams who moved in next door in exchange for her approval or quit. Full of memorable one-liners, great chemistry between the leads, and Heigl's very cute dancing for joy, Butler proves himself to be as capable a leading man in a romantic comedy as he is an action star.",9,12,30,21 July 2009
