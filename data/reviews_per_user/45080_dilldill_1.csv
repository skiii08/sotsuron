Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very entertaining but it's missing something...
","I waited 4 hours in a long line of Star Wars junkies to be the first kid on my block to see the Phantom Menace.  Well.... it was very good.  Maybe the best of the Star Wars saga but it was missing something.... First of all, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying piece of trailer trash since the TeleTubbies.  I thought it would be a more entertaining movie if he got killed, skinned and fed to the heroes to honor their bravery.Also the space combat scene left me wanting more.  A LOT more.  It's far too short and a smidge on the boring side. There are some truly kick ass scenes though.  eg.  the Pod Race. It must be seen to be believed.  And the WICKED lightsabre climax scene between Obi Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul.  By far the best scene in the movie. I also would have liked to see more of Samuel L. Jackson.  He deserved more than a bit role.  Also, you will notice that this is the only movie where he doesn't say n*gger, B*tch, or m*therf*cker.  Quite a big step for Sam, I'd say.Anyway.  Even though it has it's shaky areas, See this movie.  You won't regret it!  (Like I had to tell you that)",8,0,1,19 May 1999
