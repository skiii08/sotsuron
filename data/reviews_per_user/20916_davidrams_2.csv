Requiem for a Dream," Unbelievable
","Wow! I think this is the best word to describe this movie. This movie was amazing. I mean I've seen a lot movies before but this was the best. The acting was unbelievable Jared Leto, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and last but not least Marlon Wayans (who surprised me most of them) deserve all the Academy Award. The script was great, also the superb directing. The cinematography was awesome and perhaps the best I've seen in years. Also the hunting score is one of the best I've ever heard. But attention: This movie is not for everyone. It's really sad and depressing. After I watched this movie I was sitting in front of my TV couldn't say a word and felt really, really bad. I thought I have to cry but I couldn't. Hours later I was still thinking about this masterpiece of film making. One of the best movies of all time 10/10",10,0,1,15 June 2002
Unbreakable," Amazing
","Well I have to say like a lot of other guys before me, that it's hard for me to understand why people can dislike this movie. Otherwise it doesn't matter how other people think about this movie, cause it's my review. I love every bite of the film, the slow moving story, the character development, this amazing visual style that Shyamalan brought to this movie. The acting was superb especially Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson did a perfect job. I liked the ending very much although I'm not a comic book fan i liked the whole story because it's made very realistic. All in all a fantastic movie that's to underrated. Give this flick a chance. 10/10",9,0,0,1 August 2002
