Frost_Nixon," Stunning
","A brilliant showing of the Frost Nixon interviews. Great acting all around and a stunning case study of Nixon at his finest. Controlling everything till confronted with the simple truth. Frost a 'talk show host' confronting what was, for those of us on the left, the boogey man of politics. The man who pulled no punches against his opponents even when those punches were sent below the belt and seemed to be the most distanced and arrogant of men. An Interview for the ages that leaves one almost feeling sorry for Nixon as he spends his remaining years despised by the world for actions that he, it seems, honestly felt were for the greater good.This is not a Nixon pardon, far from it, it's a call to realize that Presidents need to be held accountable for their actions regardless if they are done for the greater good, when those actions result in the greater evil as it were. The final scenes of these interviews are stunning and powerful, the looks and the feeling that went in are what pushed this film from good to great in my opinion. Definitely one of the top must see movies of this year.",9,4,7,24 January 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Beautiful Made but a script a teenager could make.
","This movie is beautifully made with an amazing look at the slums of India and I'll be going out tomorrow to see if I can't find the soundtrack somewhere. That said i found the script had the feeling that it was written by a love sick teenager with some absolutely cheesy lines and a cast of characters that feels so clichÃ©d it's just annoying. Every Indian is either rich/powerful and a complete asshole or poor and trying to screw everyone over, including the host of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire who is played with the evil malice of a man looking to crush Jamal beneath his heel. That is except, of course for our two lovers, who it seems are the only honest, kind and decent people people left around.I can understand that the movie is trying to show the dark side of growing up poor but adding a couple of different styles of characters would make the whole thing more realistic I would think. I am quite disappointed as I had only recently heard of the movie (I live in China so I don't get to see many trailers) and everything I heard had been good. I would have enjoyed the movie more if they had just left out the talking as as I said, visually it's stunning and the music was absolute wonderful.",2,6,14,24 January 2009
