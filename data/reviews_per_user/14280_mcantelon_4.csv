The Avengers," A loathsome, sordid debacle
","This movie was very triggering. It made me recall the times in my life where I saw movies that were not good. The reason this was brought to mind was because this movie was not good, other than as a sort of cultural abyss into which to stare and wonder how things were before the kind of debased species that would make this sort of movie slithered into existence.Despite the fact that this movie isn't very good, it has a lot of accomplished stars in its cast. Each of these unique stars brings to the film their own interpretation of a muted, listless performance. I felt Samuel Jackson's performance was especially so: his listlessness seemed mixed with deep despair, an existential disdain so consuming that even feeling disgust would be a comparative relief for him.In the movie a lot of things flew around. There were threats of violence. There was all the drama you'd expect in a Mexican soap opera. There was even an animatronic Gwyneth Paltrow! Joss Whedon has ingested Hollywood's gold and laid a truly magical egg.",1,5,31,15 November 2014
Hugo," Retro-Hollywood mediocrity
","It's hard to believe this movie is as highly rated as it is. It is, through and through, lacklustre tripe. The fact it won more Oscars than The Artist shows what a complete joke the Oscars are.The acting is unremarkable. The Hugo character mostly just stares and twitches his nostrils, while his gal pal mainly looks cute and smiles at everything. Baron Sasha Cohen is boring. Ben Kingsley is uninspiring. It's all Disney grade.The characters are shallow. None of them are fleshed out enough to care about.The plot is uninteresting. And slow. And full of clich√©s. And some of the plot transitions are so badly handled it's simultaneously comical and sad.The visuals are big budget, yet devoid of character. Typical Hollywood conservative aesthetics. Lots of shiny, detailed blandness.Nothing that stays with me, after watching it, other than a feeling of contempt towards Hollywood, Martin Scorsese, and anyone who thought this movie was actually good. The world would be a better place is this movie didn't exist.",6,1,4,5 March 2012
The Hurt Locker," Flat
","Flat, muted, but with a large budget, this movie didn't really seem to say much and what it did say it said clumsily. The movie started out with tension, but then kind of dragged on, running through a number of scenarios that were likely supposed to be shocking or exciting, but unravelled tediously. There were scenes full of pointless dialogue, that seemed to be trying to communicate something but failing. Most of the acting was flat, with the exception of the protagonist which delivered a good performance despite having little to work with.Given the resources it would have taken to make this movie, something interesting and resonant could have been made instead of the safe, lumbering piece it ended up being. The fact that this won 'Best Directory' is a testament to the irrelevance of the Academy.",Null,3,3,20 November 2011
Joker," Don't believe the hype
","Given Todd Phillips' body of work - his first project being a documentary about the Joker-esque G.G. Allin - I expected more. It was alright, but ultimately forgettable... basically: 'Taxi Driver' with a dash of 'Natural Born Killers'. The association with the Batman franchise was kind of fun, given the extremity of the content, but that was the only truly memorable part of it. The movie was longer than it needed to be, with a number of scenes with Phoenix hamming it up by himself, and much about it was conventional, slightly cheesy Hollywood fare. Given the interesting premise it feels like more could have been done with it. Maybe the project was rushed, maybe the studio interfered too much... who knows.",7,0,1,29 December 2019
