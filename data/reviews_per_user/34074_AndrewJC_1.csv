The Blair Witch Project," I'm never going camping again!
","TBWP has got to be the scarriest and most creepy movie I've seen in my life. The fact that there is NO music and alot of it isn't really acted out makes it seem so real. If you like a good scare, rent this movie and watch it at night. The ending will blow you away! It freaked me out bigtime. Well worth 100 minutes of your time if you like psychological thrillers.",10,2,3,17 July 2002
