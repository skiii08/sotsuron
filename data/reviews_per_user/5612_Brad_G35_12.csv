Ford v Ferrari," Exhilarating. Watch it even if you aren't a car fan.
","I was around cars as a child because of my dad and grandfather. I never took an interest in them though. I feel like this is the type of movie that could inspire an entire new generation of youngsters that want to race for a living.Christian Bale is excellent! Matt Damon is excellent! The sound design and editing sticks out to me on this movie and it's almost sure to win Oscars because of that. The cinematography does a great job of immersing you in the races and making your heart race! It'll be interesting to see what other films step up to compete in cinematography. If none show up, this will likely take that category too(Although I hope Parasite takes it).The script is good but I did find myself a little bored during parts of the character development scenes. Christian Bale is always Christian Bale but I do think Matt Damon was the stronger character here. I love Bale's movies and I'll always see them but Christian Bale reminded me of how he is for his role in The Fighter so in Oscar respects it's kind of an already been there done that kind of thing.This movie brings up competition for me. While it seemed to be heavy back then, I'm curious how much of a cut-throat competition it is nowadays.While this story favors America, I do think when it comes to industrial things or car-related things... American ingenuity is going to win out every time when it matters.",8,1,2,26 November 2019
Knives Out," Movies like this...
","Movies like this usually don't appeal to me(it's just not a favorite genre). I enjoyed this movie a lot. The star-studded cast carries the film for the most part. I do think that Daniel Craig is the MVP for this movie.I was surprised that you find out most of the actual story near the beginning of the movie. From there, it's reveal after reveal of what actually happened.Definitely give this movie a chance. It's not perfect but you should enjoy yourself.",7,2,3,30 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not terrible but...
","I'm not going to rave about this movie but I'm also not going to say it's the worst ever. It's a tough decision between rating it 7 or 8 but I'll bump it to 8. I do wish they would've went with one person to run all three movies in this trilogy. There is a bit of damage control it seems as the movie rushes through most scenes.The spoilers that Palpatine was in the movie came out earlier in the week and those were fine. (MAJOR SPOILER): The reveal that Rey is a Palpatine was a definite surprise! I didn't see that coming at all and quite frankly, I'm still a little surprised! The only thing bad about the reveal is how it was revealed. It felt rushed as Rey was trapped into listening before jumping on the Millennium Falcon and rushing away. Rey struggles with that reveal but the emotional impact didn't seem to land with her or the audience. I would've liked to see her struggle with it with a possible turn. She didn't struggle at all. For her, she was more scared that the dark side would take over. (MAJOR SPOILER)Honestly, I would've loved it if both Rey and Kylo would've had to die in order to destroy Palpatine. The finale and final outcome just seemed to be too easy. For a series where Darth Vader was taking care of business at one point... to see the enormous fleet in this movie, Palpatine, and Palpatine's demise all in a matter of 45 minutes... that is the disappointing part for me. It would've also been interesting if Rey would've taken over as a Sith with Ben switching back over to good. After all, it's all about a balanced force, right?There are obvious plot holes and trilogy issues with this movie. For me, I can slot this movie into my 3rd or 4th spot of favorites from the episode movies. People are right with the pacing. It's fast and at times it feels like scenes are missing or that it's moving along so that you don't notice something bad with the movie. That pacing does help to send the movie along... it didn't drag for me at all.One other side note is I wish the creators of this movie would've had some courage. They faked us out with Chewie, C3PO, Rey, and Ben(multiple times). Take a chance and end one of these characters.It was obvious that the trilogy switched back to JJ. It's amazing how clear it is that this trilogy was JJ, Rian, and then back to JJ.The last thing I'm going to mention is the humor. Some of it was your typical Star Wars humor and it was good. Giving lines to Poe, Finn, and a few others just didn't work. I found myself rolling my eyes more than actually laughing.I'd suggest not relying on the reviews. Go in with an open mind and don't be so critical of certain plot holes and you should be fine. It'll be interesting to see how this installment holds up over the years. As much hate as Episodes 1-3 received... I still love and watch episodes 2 and 3 all the time.",8,2,10,20 December 2019
Yesterday," If you're a fan of The Beatles...
","See this movie. This movie falls short on being a great film but overall it's something worth watching. I wasn't sure how they were going to stretch this idea out over 2 hours but it worked well.*SPOILERS*
One of the parts that isn't realistic to me is how he came clean at the end. In our world, I don't think anyone would ever come clean like that if something like this ever happened.Also, if they're going to have the main character go visit Lennon, why not put the band members that are alive in the movie too or at least have actors impersonate them.Small nitpicks but just observations.",7,1,2,1 October 2019
Toy Story 4," A little disappointing...
",I've been a diehard Pixar fan since the start. I've been a fan of all the movies although I'm not sure we needed the Cars sequels.Toy Story 1-3 I can watch over and over... even as a mid-30s adult. I was happy when they announced this 4th one. Unfortunately it didn't hit the same notes as the first three. It has some funny moments and concepts but overall it's a forgettable movie. It's unfortunate.,5,1,2,29 October 2019
The Lion King," It's not completely terrible but...
","The other reviews claiming that it has no soul or heart. Those reviews are spot on.The movie isn't inherently bad. It's practically an almost identical movie to its animated original. The movie also looks amazing! Most of the time you can see the obvious animation. This one is so animated that it could pass for live action.This is a definitely taste of the future. Kid's cartoons will be this.Back to the no soul. It's amazing how the voice actors for the animated version are better than these voice actors. Half of the time it was like these voice actors were just reading their lines... no emotion. No heart. No anything.Some of my favorite parts of the original were definitely ruined and didn't have as much umph.One other plus side... it was nice to finally see John Oliver as Zazu. In this situation, the role chose the person.",3,1,2,4 February 2020
1917," Technical Masterpiece.
","This movie works on so many technical levels that it's a must see in theaters. This is the reason you go to the movies. I'm a sucker for the one-shot format and this movie is excellent at it.I do think this movie works because of the directing and cinematography. If the directing, cinematography, and one shot wouldn't have been there, I don't think this movie would even be talked about this year.The story is on the lighter side because it's about delivering a message. We've seen this before. The film comes alive with these master filmmakers doing what they do best!The only thing weird about this movie is when the soldier stumbled upon the mom and her baby. That entire scene seemed a little weird to me. It didn't seem to fit the movie for me.The Oscar slate is stacked this year but if you see any movie in theaters this Oscar season, this is the one to see.",9,0,1,15 January 2020
Joker," It's hard to not give this movie a 10 but...
","I'll go with a 9. I waited a few months to see this movie. I wanted most of the buzz to disappear and to randomly enjoy it one day. Even then, I wanted to hate this movie and not believe the hype was real. The buzz about this movie is indeed REAL.The first thing to get out of the way is this isn't really a comic book movie. Sure. The character comes from a comic book but it's anything but that. This movie is about mental health. This movie is about how society tends to isolate and cast people out. That would drive anyone crazy! We need to embrace everyone's differences. That's what makes humankind better.Should Joaquin get an Oscar for this? Yes. Absolutely! Will he? If I know the Academy... I doubt. He was absolutely PERFECT with this portrayal. In some ways, I think he was better than Heath. I just don't see the Academy giving the Oscar to a movie based on a comic book... that surface level description will cause them to give it to someone else. Joaquin made this movie what it is. Period.For me, this movie didn't start to pick up until the 2nd half so it'll be more interesting when I rewatch it. Certain things like cinematography and directing were a little off to me. Certain things with the plot didn't seem to fit. Parts of the first half just seemed boring and for lack of a better term... forced. That might change after a rewatch. The score was good only half of the time in my opinion.This is one of the best DC films ever made. It might as well have been made while the Dark Knight trilogy was hot.Overall, this movie went places that it needed to go and it didn't shy away from going full speed. I suspect this movie will be difficult for some to get through but movies like this are needed to make an impact and let people know that mental illness is a serious thing.",9,3,9,10 December 2019
Parasite," This movie is sticking with me.
",I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.What a film.,10,22,36,26 November 2019
Marriage Story," Worth the watch.
","This movie will play differently to different people. For me, it hit close to home. Growing up in a broken family, I had to start dealing with parent issues when I was 6. I remember things vividly. My mom running away with me in the night. The fights. The split. The divorce and endless battle over things. Going to my dad's on the weekend and a variety of other things. This movie displays that like nothing else ever has.Despite both parties wanting a clean divorce, it also shows how nasty that can become. It's frustrating to experience and just as frustrating to watch on screen.Adam and Scarlett have standout performances in this film. We all know what Scarlett can do. We also know what Adam is capable of but I believe this is one of his best roles on display here.It was interesting to me since this movie didn't have violence. My parent's divorce and I've seen many friends that had nasty divorces with violence included. While depressing, it was still somewhat refreshing to see this situation play out with no violence.The only aspect of this film that falls short to me is how the couple is tied up with acting. That's fine and I'm sure things like this happen with relationships in Hollywood but it made the film a little pretentious. It became a battle of one person's career in theatre/Broadway in NY vs another person's TV career in LA. It made it tough to relate and while the plot tried to remain focused on the kid as being the reason, I couldn't get past it.There could be best actor/actress chances behind this film going in to rewards season but It's not taking any technical or best picture awards. I could also see some screenplay nods here.This film is certainly worth the watch. It'll likely be one of the films remembered when you see it come up but I doubt it'll be revisited as years go by.",8,3,5,11 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Almost perfect!
","I love Taika Waititi. Wilderpeople, Ragnarok, and now Jojo. I'm excited to see what he does with the episode of Mandalorian that he's directing. One other thing to get out of the way before reviewing. I don't like how this movie is being advertised like a Wes Anderson movie. The trailers make it seem like that but it's not that at all. It has plenty of silly but what Wes has that Taika is missing is the implied silly. Wes films have these silly moments but they don't stick out because they're so cleverly executed. With this movie... the Hitler imaginary friend seems a little odd at times.I'm ranking this at 8 but I need to watch it again. I could see this easily being pushed to 9. When I first saw the trailer to this, it was an immediate want to watch for me. My main problem with the movie is perception. Through most of the movie, it was tough to decide if this should be funny or serious. Honestly, I think you could watch it in two ways. A funny-haha movie romp or a serious movie about a kid with ingrained hate and how things aren't always what they seem.I consider this a must-see. I'm not sure if Taika meant for this to have a strong message but it definitely does. Not to sidetrack but Jojo having that hate ingrained by what's around him; I experienced that recently by my dad's girlfriend and her grandson. It was a disappointing moment seeing that happen in plain sight.I'm not sure where this movie will sit in overall movie collections but I think it will definitely stick out as one of Taika's best.",8,2,6,4 November 2019
Midway," Better than expected!
","I was immediately drawn to this movie from the trailer. I like war movies. I love learning about events that happened that I was never taught or mentioned in school. Furthermore, I love to learn about events on that side of the world(not just with America but with things that happened in China/Japan/Indonesia and so on that we're never taught in the west).One of the more notable things to mention about this movie is how it's not politically driven. The director/writers set out to make a re-enactment of an event that not many people know about unless you're in the military. I'll admit that some of the character stories aren't the most interesting but there had to be something there to get the audience interested and to propel the movie along.Unlike some of the other war movies, I like how this movie tied the opposing side in. Usually we hear and see it from one side(America's side). It's critical that when we learn about history that we learn about all sides and perspectives.If you like war movies, you'll love this movie. It doesn't waste anytime ramping up the action. They even include(while very little) some of the Japanese invasion of China in this movie. Can the West please start giving us some films about history in the East? ... because we definitely aren't going to be taught about it in school.We all obviously know how WW2 turned out but this movie gave me the feeling that it really could've went either way. Both sides in this movie were making strategic moves without GPS and many other things.Definitely see this movie if you like these kinds of movies.",8,1,1,25 November 2019
