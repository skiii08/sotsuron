The Perks of Being a Wallflower," It was okay...but definitely not infinite
","Everyone goes on about this movie like it is legendary and life changing. I thought it was okay. The basic story is a teenager named Charlie (Logan Lerman) is having trouble fitting into a new school. Unlike a lot of teenage dramas, he actually has some real problems. He is mentally ill. I really applaud this story for tackling a topic like this, one that is ignored or over dramatised in films. I thought they dealt with it realistically and respectfully. Charlie is then taken under the wing of two seniors, Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), who show him the way of the world. The story itself has some really great aspects to it. Some scenes in the movie were also very unique and thought provoking. Some of the best include: the dance, the cafeteria fight, the scene where Sam and Charlie talk at the first party and of course, the famous car scene. Unfortunately, many of the other scenes are easily forgettable, some even uncomfortable to watch. Though the movie does tackle some unique issues, other aspects of the storyline were slightly clich√©d. I also found some parts of the story very unclear to follow. Having not read the book, my first time watching this movie I was downright confused during many of the scenes, especially those with flashbacks as I thought those were not clearly represented. The characters themselves were a bit bland. Charlie, Sam and Patrick all have fantastic back stories, but I found hearing about their stories much more interesting than actually watching the characters interact. There are some other (brief) characters such as their friends and family who frankly I cannot remember anything about as they were really looked over. I thought that Emma Watson and Ezra Miller did a good job at working with what they were given, as they made the characters more interesting (than they originally were anyway) but Logan Lerman, though excellent in some scenes, seemed slightly lacking in others. Overall, a good film. There's nothing terrible about it, and some aspects were really great. Others may have needed a little more thought. Based on some of the other reviews, this movie has changed people's lives and inspired them and that's great. But for me, I'm not sure if I'd watch it again. When I originally watched the trailer I thought it looked like an incredible film, so I was a little disappointed. It did not leave me feeling awed or 'infinite', but that I did get my money's worth out of it. So I suggest people give it a try, as you may just be that inspired by it.",10,0,0,4 June 2014
The Hunger Games," It is called a book-movie adaptation for a reason. As a movie it is very well done, and still manages to stay relatively true to the book as well.
","I'm surprised at how many bad reviews other users are giving this movie! Sure, it isn't the greatest book-movie adaptation ever, but as a movie itself and especially compared to book-top movie adaptations of other Young Adult novels (eg. Percy Jackson or Mortal Instruments), it is very well done. I'm a massive fan of the series, I've read every book several times and was very exited for this movie. I feel it did not disappoint. Yes, they had to cut out some aspects to fit it into a movie that is already over two hours. If people are looking for a film exactly like the book they are never going to find it with anything. It called an adaptation for a reason. And as a first installment to a movie series this was done very well. Casting choice was perfect. Absolutely. Usually aging up some of the characters can ruin elements, fortunately Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale's (Liam Hemsworth) casting was some of the most brilliant I've seen. Other characters including Haymitch (Woody Abernathy), Prim (Willow Shields), Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) were exceptionally well cast as well. The actors are, personally, the best thing about the movie. Portraying the characters and their stories (with what is not the best screenplay) was very well done. The costumes, score and production design was also very good. Unfortunately cinematography is not - though the 'shaky cam' adds to the realism of the situation it also adds to the realism of a headache if you watch too closely. The screenplay was not the best but still kept true to the book. Overall people are treating it too harshly, they did well. But if you do want to see an exceptionally accurate book-movie adaptation, go watch its sequel, Catching Fire.",8,0,3,1 April 2014
Ice Age: Continental Drift," A cheesy, disappointing end to a truly brilliant movie series
","Very disappointing. I've watched every single Ice Age movie in the cinemas, known the stories backwards, grew up with these characters. The end to the 3rd movie felt completed, like a brilliant trilogy had come to an end. Why, oh why did they feel the need to make another one? Oh, I forgot, the very reason why most films are made these days - money. This movie is a cheap money grabber with good animation. The story was bland and predictable, brilliantly written characters from previous films are given absolutely no character development, barely any good dialog and not nearly as much screen time as they deserve. Instead we are presented with new characters like: Peaches, Manny and Ellie's daughter who is a 'rebellious teen who no one understands', the guy she has a crush on who gets way more screen time than he should because he's voiced by someone famous, other teen mammoths who...have no names and no personality but are also voiced by famous people! There's also an actual villain. Ugh. One of the best things about the Ice Age movies is how they handled villains. They were never main characters - because the story was about Manny, Diego and Sid - but they were cleverly written with brilliant dialog and interesting motives. In this movie we get : a large, pirate monkey. With no motives besides 'being evil' - and not even being epically evil or maliciously evil, just annoying and stupid - this character has no interesting dialog, has no point besides 'being the bad guy' and overall is a stupid, useless, not thought-out, pathetic excuse for a villain and for a character. The only two new characters out of the many, many, many of them (who are introduced for a scene and then are never seen again) are Peaches rodent friend and J- Lo's tiger. Unfortunately they have so little screen time I can't even remember their names. The story is predictable, boring, filled with waaayyy too many plot holes and a disgrace to the other well thought out, interesting and unique plots the other Ice Age movies had. I keep comparing this movie to the other Ice Age films, but even on its own this movie is terrible. There was NO MORALE TO THE STORY. One of the biggest reasons for children's movies is to teach morales or lessons in unique ways. Though a few minor characters redeem themselves, the main characters learn NOTHING. It's pathetic. They used up every single humorous piece of dialog during the ads, so when you went to watch the movie nothing was funny. I guess that served the purpose though, get audiences to the movies to MAKE MONEY! The new characters are terrible, old characters are forgotten about, story is awful, so what was good about this film? Animation. Yes, the animation was nice. Not as brilliant as, say, Disney or Pixar, but still impressive (especially with all the water scenes). The end credits song is good (though was written to show how many famous people were involved with the cast). Basically this movie is a sorry excuse for an end to a brilliant set of movies. Blue Sky studios, please feel ashamed. You made a movie in which you took some of the most beloved childhood characters and did nothing with them, wrote a bunch of pointless other characters, a stupid story and then MADE A BUNCH OF MONEY!",4,0,0,2 April 2014
