Casablanca," This is a fun movie, but it is not art.
","Who can't help but to like this film? It has a rugged, square-jawed hero, bad guys (not just Nazis, but the French who would betray their own country to the Nazis), a pretty girl (very pretty), exotic locales, and lines that everyone can recite, a la Rocky Horror Picture Show. Lots of fun. However, the fact that this is on the IMDB top 250 is sad. There are at least 250 films better than it (notice I say 'better than' not 'that I like more,' nor 'that you like more'). Degustibus non disputandus est. I will grant that. However, art has tougher criteria than 'I like it, and my opinion counts because I am Me!' Casablanca is a disjointed muddle of a film. It is cliche ridden, as subtle as a ton of dynamite, and does not come close to true masterpieces of film art. Want to see a good wartime film with good heros and bad villains? See Rome, Open City or La Notte di San Lorenzo.For a better, deeper critique of what is wrong with this film, I suggest reading Umberto Eco's essay on it. It is (I think), found in How to Travel with a Salmon or Travels in Hyperreality.",3,17,39,10 November 1999
Mr. Holland's Opus," Cliches, inept music, and bad acting - oh what fun.
","My first complaint is one that can be applied to almost every popular movie about music, to whit, a movie about someone who has a passion for music should have competently written music in it. Also, there should be no flaws in musicology. If one is not going to get every detail right on music, one should make a movie about dinosaurs or middle-aged housewives meeting old college flames or hard-hearted cynics finding a spark of warmth in the world. One who is not willing to understand that in music, more than in any other field (besides rocket science), the devil is in the details.However, that having been said, there are movies (Amadeus comes to mind) where the history and music were inaccurately portrayed but still worked as movies. Mr. Holland does not make up for the shortcomings. It is clicheed, poorly scripted, and not well acted. I cannot say that there is a great movie about passion for music driving a composer. Probably because popular romantic notions about artists and composers are silly and wrong to begin with, a movie based on such a flawed premise is destined to fail. Music is interesting, so study music, study music theory, study music history. Learn what makes good music good and bad music bad (it is not all that subjective). Do not waste time on inane pap like Mr. Holland's Opus.",2,9,24,13 December 1999
