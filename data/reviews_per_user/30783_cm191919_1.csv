Hereditary," One of the biggest disappointment
","Didn't know a movie could make me this angry...This movie is all over the place and lack so much common sense, it is painful to watch. Nothing happens for the first 3/4 of the movie and then a complete none sense crap show starts. One of the weakest movie I ever got to see. Complete waste of time, wouldn't recommend it to anyone",1,3,4,27 January 2020
