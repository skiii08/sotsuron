The Equalizer," I loved it!
","I am disappointed with the negative reviews. It seems some people just want to be critical and it's not sporting. Denzel Washington is great, never does a bad movie to be totally honest always great value for money. I heard he always chooses his movies very carefully, and this fits straight into what he prefers, good v evil where good must prevail. I found myself really drawn in and very engaged when he assesses the threat capacity of his opponents. There is something quite satisfying about the action he takes and I felt that I was on the journey with him. As for previous comments who really cares if the Russians were not authentic Russians??? The casting was really good. I prefer to view movies as pure entertainment and I think trying to critique everything or the authenticity of people places and story lines just takes the fun out of it. It's good fun, enjoyable and DW at his best! One to watch again.",10,0,4,5 April 2015
