Despicable Me 2," A Very Despicable Sequel
","After seeing the success of Despicable Me, I had a few reservations for the sequel which I caught yesterday... Oh, trust me, it's still playing in theaters, the best medium to see it on, especially with minimum number of kids in the audience... I think there were only 2 kids in the whole theater... And it was 2 kids too many, if you ask me... I'm such a Gru, ain't I? The concept for the original was phenomenal: a super villain named Gru, voice by the talented Steve Carrell in his most intriguing and strangely foreign English accent, whose evil master plan was to steal the moon. Quite a feat, right? By the time Despicable Me is over, I couldn't help myself but fall in love with the grouchy character with a heart of gold who adopts three adorable little orphans, much against his will, and learns how being a parent matters more than accomplishing his evil act that would make him the most accomplished villain that ever was. Suddenly, stealing the moon doesn't seem to fulfill Gru anymore and being a parent becomes his priority. In the sequel, we meet Gru and his orphans right as he is organizing a birthday party for his little princess Agnes. Everything is doing well until he learns that his 'princess' will not be showing up after all and so he must please his adopted daughter by dressing up as a princess himself in what's possibly the funniest scene of the entire movie. The scene is so funny and endearing that it summarizes what the rest of Despicable Me 2 is all about: the importance of having a family. Speaking of family, I happened to catch up this movie with old friends, the same ones that came to see The Happening (how can I forget The Happening?) as well as Gnomeo & Juliet. It's great to meet these wonderful friends that, regardless of how long some of us have been apart, feels as if time has not passed by at all. Funny how I consider these friends more than I consider some members of my own family and I'm proud to say that I can really call them friends, without hesitation. Especially after what I've gone through lately at work, it's nice to know that I can still count on these friends, that I can rest assured that whatever I tell them will be kept among us. It's taken this long to realize who my real friends are, and who are just trying to take advantage. Back to Despicable Me 2, I have to say that it's Gru's minions that really bring the comic relief in an otherwise ordinary and predictable film: Gru takes a jive at dating, with disastrous results, until he realizes that his new partner in crime Lucy (voiced by Bridesmaids' Kristen Wiig) is really the one that completes him, the only one that gets him and admires him. There are plenty of laughs thanks to the yellow, mischievous minions that end up dressing up as French maids, as firefighters, as Hula Hula dancers and many more outfits that will keep everybody laughing. Many jokes are geared towards the adults as well, as a matter of fact a big chunk of the movie will have the kids abay. The plot involves another villain who abducts his or her victims through a spacecraft that resembles a giant magnet. I noticed how the 'experimental' kids that were in the audience were oblivious to this whole plot (although they also suffered from a severe case of ADD anyways) and could have cared less if there was a plot. They had come to see the minions, that's it. I never would have thought that having a plot could ruin the momentum of a movie but this was the case with Despicable Me 2. I believe that having less plot and more laughs would have help this movie soar, especially when you are trying to please your targeted audience. My favorite moment came when the minions, dressed up in their white suits, performed 'This I Swear' by Boys 2 Men. I was literally in tears watching these minions belting it out and I will look forward to seeing that scene again when it comes to cable (not too far out, I assume). I will definitely look forward to seeing Despicable Me 3, their animation is always phenomenal, script is always funny as well as having Steve Carrell who has made of Gru into a villain that everyone can relate to and loves to love. Maybe not what a villain wants to hear, right? Oh and can't forget about those minions: yellow, purple or in any outfit they will breathe life and laughter into any Despicable movie.",7,1,2,4 September 2013
The Impossible," Impossible not to cry
","The Impossible is the incredible true story of the Belón family who are vacationing on this beautiful resort in Thailand along with their 3 boys: a 12 teenager named Lucas, another 7 ½ and a 5 year old. They wake up the morning after Christmas ready to enjoy another beautiful day at the beach resort when disaster strikes. The first few minutes after the giant waves come crashing down palm trees, cars, debris, people and everything in their path, I kept clutching onto the armrests bracing for impact. Even after seeing Hereafter and Tsunami: The Aftermath, including the real footage from that fateful day, the horrible images from the tsunami still send chills down my spine. Not only do I have to endure seeing people disappear under the waves but then I get a look under water which is even more frightening than what's afloat. If you've ever been dragged by a giant wave while boogie boarding then you can just imaging what that felt like and multiply it by a hundred and you'll begin to understand how your body gets crushed, mutilated, scraped under the violent current underwater. No detail is spared in The Impossible and, as much as you try to look away, the noise of desperation deafens you and you just can't help but feel helpless. Both Maria (Naomi Watts) and her oldest son Lucas try to hold onto each other against the violent waves. Here lies the heart of the movie and the unforgettable struggle to survive is what drives this movie, gets a hold of the audience and doesn't let go. The images are so real that I felt as if I was being hit by the waves and the debris that they carry within. What director Juan Antonio Bayona accomplished with this recreation of the devastation that unfolds with the most powerful tsunami recorded in modern history is unparalleled. What's more unparalleled is the miracle that Henry (Ewan McGregor) and his 2 youngest sons have also survived miraculously the first impact of the tsunami and are now in search for Maria and Lucas which is like looking for a needle in a haystack. I believe that Naomi Watts's Maria really held on to life for her oldest son since they had lost faith in seeing the rest of the family. Lucas confronts her mother and tells her, without hesitation, that they're all dead and they only have each other to survive. As hard as it is to accept, she must accept that her son may be right and she sort of make him in charge since her condition gets worse by every moment. Lucas (played by Tom Holland) must make the decisions that would either save them or cost their lives so he must grow up and fast. Luckily they are found by villagers that take them to safety.",10,3,7,7 January 2013
127 Hours," Between a Rock and a Hard Place
","I watched this movie yesterday after having heard so much about this guy's adventure in the Utah's Canyonlands National Park where Aron Ralston (James Franco) had made his routine to venture all on his own and jump from rock to rock in his bike, carelessly defying death with every move he made.It's exhilarating to watch this daredevil and seeing how he breathes danger and nature, he loves this place so much that he's almost forgotten about the rest of the world, it's like he's become a loner who enjoys his time more when he's alone in the wild than when he's around his family. Yet he records every moment along the way with his camcorder and camera, he chronicles his journey as if he just wanted everyone to live through his every adventure and be able to tell the story: I survived this, I survived that...After parting ways from a couple of very attractive young girls who were lost in the wilderness of this beautiful and astonishing park, Aron decides to take a shortcut back to his truck in order to get ready to party with these girls later on that evening. There's all these cracks in the mountain that allow very little space to go through it, it's like being caught inside a giant maze where there's no safe way out unless you're as experienced as Aron is. His confidence allows him to jump as a jaguar from rock to rock without care... Until the unthinkable happens.He falls along with a giant boulder that pretty much smashes his hand and forearm and traps him in the middle of nowhere. His initial reaction is to scream for help but as the camera zooms out we realize it's almost impossible for anyone to hear him. He's literally caught between a rock and a hard place as his self titled book is called and he must find a way to chip away from this boulder to free his hand and arm from the boulder.What I most liked about the movie is not so much the fact that he had to resort to drinking his own urine, or the fact we were witnessing a man severing his own arm to liberate himself and find his way back home. It's more interesting to focus in what was going through his mind while he was trapped all this time alone in the freezing cold temperature, suspended up in the air with little food and water to sustain himself. I think what came through at the end was a man who recovers himself, a person who's forced to look at himself and see how selfish he's been, how he's shut out everyone in his life to pursue these adventures. He was destined to fall at that precise time, in that precise place as he himself describes it: 'You know, I've been thinking. Everything is... just comes together. It's me. I chose this. I chose all this. This rock... this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. It's entire life, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, billion years ago. In space. It's been waiting, to come here. Right, right here. I've been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every breath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface.' Aron Ralston Sometimes, we have to go through a tragedy, a harrowing experience of this kind to realize how precious our lives are. As Aron was cutting through his arm in his last attempt at making it out of there alive a vision of his unborn child was presented to him. People may not believe this is a sign that God exists, but Aron did. There are moments in one's life where we have to stop and thank Him for opening our eyes, if just for a little bit, to realize how much we are loved and appreciated and how we depend on others and how others depend on you.On more than one occasion I have stopped and thought: what would have happened if I hadn't gone there, if I hadn't taken the chance, if I hadn't listened... Where would I be? I thank God that I had a chance to open up my eyes and see what was in front of me, kick myself in the ass and move on with my life... God works in very mysterious ways and it's in the darkest moments that we find the light.We all carry this boulder on our shoulders, we just gotta know when to let it go...",7,0,1,30 April 2012
Life of Pi," Believe your eyes
","Lately I've been going to be movies with the uncertainty of finding a good movie, a movie that is not a complete bore, one that doesn't lack of a decent script or one without way too many special effects that overshadows the performance or the story itself. Rarely do I come out of the movie theatre with a smile on my face after having the good fortune of picking the perfect movie. Thus is the case with Life of Pi.Many times we see miracles in our every move, in every day and we choose not to see them, we're blinded by a blindfold that we put on ourselves and we question everything that we hear, everything we see. We need an open mind to the wonderful miracle of just being alive and that's what I got from watching Life of Pi. God closes a door but He always opens up a window. Or throws you a lifeboat that happens to have a Bengal tiger inside.",10,6,12,26 November 2012
Hugo," Martin Scorsese's Visual Masterpiece
","Hugo, the title character, is an orphaned boy that lives inside Paris' train station where he's in charge of making sure that all the clocks run as clockwork. It's an assignment that he takes with the most regard and is very passionate about. He lives secretly behind these clocks looking onto the passerbys that have become as part of his daily routine, a part of his own little world: enters the flower girl bringing her fresh cut flowers to sell in the station, enters the station inspector wearing a prosthetic leg (played by Sasha baron Cohen) and his loyal Doberman dog, or an older couple that never really seem to get their relationship off the ground due to her vicious little dog. Among these characters there's one in particular: George Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who runs a shop full of magic tricks and toys. He observes the man and is curious as to what makes the man such a 'scrooge'.In the first few minutes, Hugo believes that George Méliès is an evil man. After all, he takes away his precious notebook away from the boy and attempts at turning Hugo to the authorities for no apparent reason. There is, however, something that piques George's interest: a drawing of a 'automaton' a.k.a. robot. He questions the boy as to how he came about this notebook and, when Hugo refuses to answer him, he takes the notebook away from him and threatens to burn it. I remember being saddened by George's actions but I also wondered: what made his so upset? Why did he want to know about the notebook? What events took place to blacken his heart and make him so bitter about everything? READ FULL REVIEW AT MY BLOG ITALO'S CORNER",10,5,8,12 April 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Bradley Cooper's worthy of an Oscar?
","﻿When I hear of Bradley Cooper, I always picture a smart-ass, sarcastic and kind of an asshole yet very likable guy who sweats self-confidence from every pore of his body. That's not the case with his character Pat in Silver Linings Playbook.SPOILER ALERT Pat has been released from a mental institution to the care of his parents with the condition that they pay close attention to their bipolar son and avoid violating a restraining order that his wife has against him.From the few moments that we see Pat we know we're in for a wild ride. He's very visibly stable and incapable of living on his own, let alone be released to his parents' care. His father is played by no other than Robert DeNiro who has issues of his own and feels guilty that he didn't spend enough time with his son to notice that there was something wrong with him.As dysfunctional as this movie may sound, Silver Linings has a comedic side to this whole mess thanks to the witty and quick dialogue that engulfs the audience head first into Pat's chaotic and fragile world, when something can (and will) happen at any given moment. Pat's a ticking time bomb, just not sure when is it set to go off.Pat meets Tiffany (The Hunger Games's Jennifer Lawrence), a very attractive young girl who may be as messed up as Pat himself. The first words they exchange are so funny and straight to the point that it's funny to watch them read each other out,their words are like aimless bullets, they just can't contain their curiosity about each other. Their chemistry is undeniable and it's very obvious they're attracted to each other from the first seconds of their encounter, although in their condition it may be combustive and very dangerous ground. Yet she's probably the one person that can truly understand Pat and his condition.And so an odd relationship builds, a relationship that may either benefit or destroy them both and that's the beauty of Silver Linings Playbook. On one side you root for their relationship to develop yet Pat's obsession with his wife gets in the way and their timing is totally not in their favor. To top it off, Tiffany has recently become a widow and her mental condition is very fragile and volatile as well. Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany has successfully made her character very believable.Silver Linings has created a lot of Oscar buzz for both stars as well as supporting actor for DeNiro and its wonderful screenplay, which reminds me how good The Descendants' script was at last year's Oscars. Bradley Cooper was very believable and surprisingly serious in this role yet I can't quite picture him beating Daniel Day-Lewis in the biopic Lincoln. You be the judge.",10,3,7,17 December 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Better Lisbeth?
","Comparing Rooney Mara's performance from her Swedish predecessor's (Noomi Rapace) is hard to decide which actress played Lisbeth Salander better but at the climax of both movies the scene that's stuck in everyone's minds is the scene where she gets raped in such a violent way by her parole officer that it's hard to shake off this horrific scene. It's one of those scenes that is disturbing to watch yet you can't turn away from the screen. Lisbeth is such a character though that you would think that after all she's been through she would be able to fight back but she's so fragile and defenseless that you feel her pain and desperation that you wished you could help her in some way That's until she gets her sweet revenge. It's one of my guiltiest pleasures to watch Lisbeth take revenge on her oppressor in such a way that she turns him into a sheepish and obedient servant that she manipulates in whichever way she wants. No matter in what language these scenes are: they are what makes both The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo versions so compelling.The only complain that I can think of is that the story attempts to cover way too much ground for just one movie. You don't know if you enjoyed the family mystery bit, or the murderer still on the loose bit, or Mikeal's scandal bit, or Lisbeth's personal struggle bit. It's hard to stay focused unless you're reading the novel series by Stieg Larsson which possibly cover as many subplots as possible and I bet it'd be a great read but it doesn't always translate well into one single film. Another peeve of mine is that I kept comparing both versions of the movie to the point where it was distracting me and I kept wondering: Was Lisbeth Salander more bisexual than the Swedish version? Was Mikeal Blomkvist more compelling the first time around or was he just uninteresting this time around (sorry Daniel Craig but I liked Michael Nyqvist better)? Did this new rape scene seem way longer than in the original version? Was the killer in the original version (or even the book version) more frightening than the new version (I shall not reveal who that is for those who still haven't seen it)?And the biggest question I needed to ask is: why does Hollywood try to imitate every single successful movie out there? Are there not enough stories, best-seller novels or scripts out there that deserve the movie treatment? I think that Hollywood producers take American audiences for granted and they underestimate their appreciation for the arts. I'm sure if a movie is good in Chinese, or Swedish or Spanish then you should just watch it and not have to wait until they remake it in your native tongue, and you'd be surprised to know how many movies have been redone in the past that were better left alone: The Eye (better in its original Japanese version), Open Your Eyes (redone and retitled for American audiences as 'Vanilla Sky', never able to imitate the original Spanish version), Diabolique (I heard the French version was much scarier than the American version starring Sharon Stone) or even Fright Night which was one of my favorite films in the 80's (I've heard the remake with Colin Farrel was really bad). One lesson to be learn here: if it ain't broken why try to fix it? READ MY FULL REVIEW IN MY BLOG: ITALO'S CORNER",7,5,12,10 April 2012
Behind The Candelabra," 10 Reasons Not to Date Liberace
","Behind The Candelabra ﻿ Why shouldn't you date Liberace? First of all, you'll be dating a dead man, so that's creepy. But, seriously, there are more than just ten reasons not to date Liberace, portrayed with eerily accuracy by Michael Douglas as the aging piano virtuoso that entertained Vegas audiences for decades in the latest HBO Films' Behind The Candelabra (Available now on HBO On Demand). When I first heard about this film being done, I had my doubts about Michael Douglas and Matt Damon (as Scott) playing lovers, I had my reservations that they'd be perfect for each other. Last night I was proved wrong. Not only did Michael Douglas do a great job but Matt Damon as well, two people that couldn't be any more different than each other and whose torrid love affair, if you could call it that, was told until Liberace died victim of AIDS back in 1987. If Liberace ever saw this movie, he would certainly die all over again. He was, first and foremost, a pianist, a showman, an entertainer. He would have never been of his closet or caught in the scandal of having a boy toy whom he could call his own. And Scott was one of many boy toys that Liberace wanted to play with. Little by little, Liberace took Scott under his wing and allowed him to see the man behind the curtain, the flawed man who clinged on to his youth as if reclaiming his own, as if he could, somehow, stop time and live forever. So why not date a old millionaire, you ask? Well, there are 10 main reasons why you shouldn't date Liberace, starting with:﻿﻿ Reason #10 Don't date an old man for money. No matter how much money, Rolls Royce, jewelry, one hundred dollar bills and bling-bling he throws at you... He will take it away from you in a New York minute. He had lawyers that will screw you into the ground so do yourself a favor and get out while you still have your young looks and charm... They won't last you forever...﻿﻿﻿﻿ Reason #9 Don't let him change you. Even if Liberace wants to pay for all the procedures for you to endure, don't do it. Here is one of the funniest scenes of Candelabra: we get to meet Dr. Rob Lowe, a plastic surgeon who can barely close his eyes after having so many surgeries himself. This surgeon is so hilarious that I wonder how Michael Douglas and Matt Damon control themselves while filming his scenes. So take my advice, don't allow Liberace to change your looks... Especially if he wants you to look like a younger version of himself.Reason #8 He'll always find someone younger and more beautiful than you. There are too many eager fish in the sea. They include sharks, stingrays and barracudas that will stop at nothing to replace you just like when he met you. You got competition, honey!Reason #7 You are his property, whether you like it or not. I haven't seen such decadence than over a Liberace house. It seems as if Scott had been trapped inside a glass cage, unable to get out. Liberace was very particular with his lovers and didn't want Scott to have friends of his own. He was property of Liberace, whether he liked it or not. It reminded me of Hotel California: you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave. ﻿﻿ Reason #6 If Liberace dumped somebody else to be with you, don't think he won't turn right back around and do the same to you. You're just as replaceable. ﻿﻿ Reason #5 Make sure that you check the merchandise for wigs, dentures, prosthetics and other signs of aging. Nothing is ever as good as it appears on the surface.Reason #4 You become invisible. You know how people can disappear in a relationship to the point when you're no longer yourself but an image? That's exactly what happened to Scott. He hadn't found himself before he met Liberace and easily lost himself in the shuffle. He could have been his boyfriend, his chauffeur, his son, his lover, his pet... Anything that Liberace wanted, Scott was.﻿﻿ Reason #3 If you don't find Liberace attractive to begin with, trust your instincts. I couldn't help but to feel squeamish whenever I saw Liberace crawling in bed behind Scott, as a rattlesnake crawls onto its victim, ready for the kill. You saw Scott's first impressions of the man and he found him hideous. Yet, after turning into Cinderella overnight, everything seemed different, everything seemed more tolerable. If I were Scott, I'd had gone with my instincts. ﻿﻿ Reason #2 Never fall in love with Liberace. Liberace will not fall in love with you... He loves himself above all things.﻿﻿ Reason #1 Never date someone who's ashamed of his sexuality. Liberace was, in the public eye, a straight man. Maybe a little extravagant or sophisticated but still a straight man. If someone said the contrary, that person would have been sued. His sexuality was as ambiguous as the person himself. Even after watching Candelabra, I still don't know much about the artist who remained in the closet until the day he died. You still have your doubts and want to give it a try? Go right ahead, be my guest... Don't say later that I didn't tell you so...",Null,6,15,28 May 2013
Django Unchained," Unchained, Uncensored and Unashamed
","Don't get me wrong, I love Quentin Tarantino. I believe he's a very gifted screenwriter and director who comes up with great material back to back to back. Ever since I saw Pulp Fiction I thought that he is the greatest thing to happen to movies and inadvertently forced every movie since to be better and better as people tried to match his genius and quick wit. So when I went to see Django Unchained, his latest opus set in the wild, wild west, I immediately jumped at the chance to see it. I know I had to prepare myself for the gore and the violence that have dominated his movies. Also, I had to prepare to sit through almost 3 long hours (in Unchained's case, 165 minutes) of film. Nowadays, every single movie I see seems to get longer and longer and it's getting harder and harder to sit through them whether it's because the theater seats are uncomfortable, or the audience is restless, or the previews and commercials take about 20 to 30 minutes in addition to having to wait 30 minutes in line to get into the theater so by the time the movie opens my expectations are pretty damn high. Sometimes I have to remind myself what is it that I came to watch in the first place. Now, Django Unchained starts pretty strong actually. And I mean that in a good way. The premise is set early by a group of slaves, chained together, transported through rocky mountains and beautiful, harsh landscapes and guided by two cowboys riding on horseback. We see them walk long days and endless nights for miles on end. Among them is Jamie Foxx as Django, a quiet and beaten down slave who bears the marks of a brutal slashing on his back. Right there, without saying a single word, Quentin has managed to set the mood early on and indicated clearly who is the protagonist of the story. Without a single word, we learn that he's got a hard past, a past that will undoubtedly be revealed later in the film, a past that we are ever so curious to find out. His mission has been accomplished, he's got our attention. Then we're introduced to Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and Quentin's script comes to life. It's a real treat as an aspiring writer and screenwriter to hear such great scripts and Unchained doesn't disappoint in that department. Christoph Waltz, who's been in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, plays his character with gusto and gives another unforgettable performance. He plays a bounty hunter that talks with such eloquence that you would never believe what he does for a living. Both Django and Dr. Schultz form an unlikely team, he teaches Django to what extend he can stretch his rights as a bounty hunter and a former slave. Django, now a free man thanks to him, has one purpose and one purpose only: to get his wife back. She has been sold to a plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). So far, so good, I'm all ears. The problem begins when Django and Dr. Schultz meet Calvin Candie. Mind you, Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent job at portraying a man whose ambition and mischievousness can be seen in his eyes. He has finally abandoned his cute boy looks and trade them for those of a man with an evil purpose that can be seen and felt in his performance. However, the problem that I have with the script at this point was the excessive use of the N word. Now I understand that was part the lingo to refer to an African American slave at the time, however it comes a point when the word is heard so many times that it becomes tedious, heavy, almost uncomfortable to hear. In my personal opinion is a matter of taste more than accuracy. There is a difference between being accurate to being offensive, which was Quentin's intention here. Not only is this word uttered countless times in the script by white folk but we also have to hear this from Samuel L. Jackson's character, too. His character, Stephen, far from being compassionate towards Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), is really an ill-tempered curmudgeon that will stop at nothing to see her tortured for trying to escape the plantation that he runs for Calvin. That's not what bothered me about the character as much as his constant use of the N word. Coming from an African American, the word takes on a different meaning and maybe Quentin wrote this purposely to make a point. I could see many in the audience trying not to laugh whenever the word was said on screen, even if it meant to be funny. It made me wonder whether his intention was to entertain an audience or to make them uncomfortable. I believe that the latter was accomplished with Django Unchained.",5,1,3,7 January 2013
Groundhog Day," That's MISTER Punxsutawney Phil To You
","A newscast weather reporter wakes up in a small sleepy town of Punxsutawney on February 2nd (a day like today) to see whether the groundhog will forecast whether winter will last much longer or not. Except that he will be reliving the same day over, and over, and over, and over That's the premise of one of the best comedies I've ever seen: Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray and Andie McDowell. At first it might have seemed an ordinary comedy but when things started getting real weird and absurd is when Groundhog really takes flight and becomes an extraordinary story of perseverance, love and redemption. The reason I love Groundhog Day is that you start with a cynical and arrogant character named Phil (Bill Murray here at his very best) who unwillingly goes out on this special report about the Groundhog Day traditional annual event but would much rather be elsewhere. He's such a big city guy that he can't barely stand having to spend his precious time in this town, doing this silly report that he'd much rather not do at all, accompanied by his news crew of Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliot). His day's experience is detailed extensively and it may seem that it's going nowhere until Phil wakes up the next morning to Sonny and Cher's I Got You Babe on the alarm clock. From then on it's as if he was having a déjà vu moment except that he's reliving the same day all over again. At first, he brushes it off as coincidental but as the day progresses he realizes that every event during his day in Punxsutawney is repeating itself and he can foresee every single thing that's about to happen beforehand. In the following days after his initial surprise Phil feels invincible, able to do and say things in a perfected way and hoping that 'doing it well' is good enough for him to allow him to see the 'next day' but, regardless of what he does, he wakes up to I Got You Babe every morning, in the same room, having to co-exist with same locals and visitors that come to see the groundhog predict the weather.READ FULL REVIEW IN MY BLOG ITALO'S CORNER",10,1,3,29 March 2012
Les Misérables," Best Picture of the Year? Perhaphs...
","Upon hearing the first verses from Anne Hathaway's 'I Dream a Dream' with the a cappella quality achieved for this version of Les Misérables, upon seeing how her character Fantine struggles to make ends meet for her only daughter that she is so desperately trying to support is like seeing a wounded soul dying in despair. There's nothing you can do but to witness how the light escapes her eyes, how her voice breaks and how tears begin to stroll down her face after she's lost her pride, her reputation and her will to live. The scene alone is Anne Hathaway's ticket to her much deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, no question about it.It's hard to predict whether a stage production can make a successful transition to film. Sometimes it pays off very well like with Chicago and Jesus Christ Superstar, sometimes it doesn't (ahem, no comment from this peanut gallery) but none have taken the time that director Tom Hooper did by recording the actor's voices live to later add the musical orchestration in post production which makes all the difference in the world. There's a more personable and intimate quality to approaching the musical this way that gives more meaning to the lyrics spoken. And making Les Mis a sure contender for Best Picture of the Year.",8,2,5,27 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Closer than we're ever gonna get
","Sometimes the truth is ugly. Depending how you look at it: this is the story of how Americans tortured, spied, spent millions of taxpayer's dollars in the hunt of a very elusive Osama bin Laden. It's also about attaining closure, the tenacity and the courage that it took for a Navy Seal team to go on a hunch and risk their lives to capture the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks that affected every American since and the way we live today. The truth is never one sided and that's why Zero Dark Thirty is a great film. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Zero Dark Thirty was originally about the failed attempt to find bin Laden until the news about his death broke out in May 2011. What she did in such little time is short of incredible. Along with screenwriter Mark Boal, with whom she also co-wrote The Hurt Locker, had to go back to their drawing board and finish writing the eclectic finale. She managed to get us inside the compound in Pakistan where Bin Laden hid for a very long time and gave us a glimpse of the operative that almost never happened had it not been for Jessica Chastain's character Maya. Maya is based on a real CIA officer and her investigation leading up to bin Laden's location which took a decade to find. Fresh out of high school, Maya is sent to Pakistan to gather information from several prisoners that are being tortured to get leads to find bin Laden's location. The job is not easy. She is witness to how brutal are the means to get any information from these prisoners, borderline inhumane. Maya cringes at the sight of an informant drowning under a wet towel as gallons of water are poured over his mouth. Maya is clearly not comfortable with the methods, a look at her frightened expression is enough to place ourselves in her shoes. Still, she knows that this is the only way to get any information that will lead to capturing a murderer blamed for killing more than 3,000 people in the 9/11 attacks to the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The lead takes her team nowhere. Meanwhile we see attacks at the Marriot Hotel in Pakistan that kills 54 people while Maya and Jessica (Jennifer Ehle) are having a casual dinner. Maya barely survives another attack when she dodges bullets aimed at her car. Ultimately, her friend and fellow officer Jessica gets killed in a terrorist attack at Camp Chapman when a suicide bomber, claiming to be an informant, gets close enough and detonates, killing seven officers and injuring others. Jessica Chastain in Zero Dark Thirty Maya is sent back to the States for her own safety. However, she is determined that she's found the location to bin Laden's compound in Pakistan although there's no visual proof. Now it becomes her sole purpose to tantalize everybody and urge to send a team to hunt bin Laden down against political opposition. A very risky mission that pays off at the end. Zero Dark Thirty chronicles the operative of the Navy Seal team with such military precision that we feel as if we were wearing those night vision goggles. We become part of the operation and we get a clear idea of what it was like to get into bin Laden's compound. The following scenes are so nerve wrecking that you could almost hear a pin drop inside the movie theater. No history book or documentary is as detailed and truthful as Kathryn's account. She may get criticism for what she's accomplished with Zero Dark Thirty. The probably claim that she divulges too much information in such a secretive operation. I believe that we deserve the truth, as much as it may hurt. We deserve to know what happen to bin Laden. We needed closure and that's what we get with this film. On my part, Kathryn has gone where no other director, let alone a female director, has gone before.",10,11,24,13 January 2013
Prometheus," Worthy prequel to Alien
","As part of the Prometheus crew we have Michael Fassbender as a droid that never sleeps and has a tfetish for old Hollywood movies, as well as the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo herself Noomi Rapace as our heroine (think of her as Sigourney Weaver's Ripley) and Charlize Theron as a mean, mean corporate bitch who, quite frankly, could have been easily replaced by a hologram since that's all her character was. Then you have all the expendables that fall victim of a snake-like creature, to a crew member who gets infected and, finally, by the 'superior' aliens who never come in peace. Oh, and in case you are pregnant and are undecided about having the natural birth versus a C-section I suggest you skip this movie altogether. Just take my word for it.",8,2,10,26 June 2012
The Wolverine," The Better Man of Steel
","When it comes to superhero movies we've had more than a decent share in recent years: Spider-Man, Iron Man, The Avengers, Thor (and the upcoming Thor 2), Dark Knight, Man of Steel, you name it, it's been done, sometimes overdone and overkill if you ask me. Still, no word about Wonder Woman... We've come to expect the greatest in CGI effects, settings and graphics, state of the art 3D effects that will make the audience come back for more. The one thing that I have gotten pretty tired of lately is such overload of special effects that almost takes over the story instead of enhancing it, leaving us without much substance and fulfillment. Such is the case with Man of Steel which I had expected it would bring something new to Superman that I hadn't seen before, a side of weakness and humanity that will make us relate to the hero everyone already knows and loves. And, although it brought us the familiar story of a boy sent to Earth after his home planet Krypton was destroyed and gave us great eye candy to look at with Henry Cavill as the Man of Steel, it lacked something, the side of Superman that we yearn to see: ourselves. In order for any superhero to grab the audience's attention is that it should be relatable and, quite frankly, I could not relate much with a man in tights with a giant S on his chest without having a strong actor and a great, smart script that will make me believe in him. Luckily, Superman is not the only man made of steel in theaters this year: Wolverine has come to the rescue. Once again, Hugh Jackman comes to reprise his role as Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine, for the eighth time (that's right, boys and girls, eight times!) and he is better than ever. This time is the story of just Logan, a man that has left the mutants league and is found living in the woods, away from civilization yet close enough to gather whatever he may need, like batteries for his FM radio. The image of his lost love Jean Grey (reprised by Famke Janssen) haunts him and tortures him to the point where there's not a day that goes by when he doesn't blame himself for her death. A struggle that makes Logan very vulnerable by the minute. Soon Logan is summoned by an old friend from Japan, a man he saved from the atomic blast of the bomb thrown to Hiroshima right after the Pearl Harbor attack. The man is an honorable and noble businessman who looks to live forever and proposes to turn Logan into a mortal, to end his curse that is to live forever. I am glad that The Wolverine doesn't tap much into the X-Men universe and we never get to see Logan step into his tight superhero suit, although the ladies (and some gentlemen, too) will be glad to know that Hugh Jackman shows his ripped body quite a bit throughout the movie, an intense workout routine and a diet that consisted of eating six whole chickens a day has really paid off for the 44 year old and even landed him in Fitness magazines everywhere. I never thought of Logan as a comic superhero here but a man cursed with steel claws, the ability to heal and his immortality. And there is a difference. Specially when his powers get taken away and all we have left is a man that hurts, bleeds, gets tired and is vulnerable like the rest of us. Someone we humans can relate to. I also enjoyed the Japanese settings, the hustle of Tokyo, the scene atop the bullet train that kept me at the edge of my seat, the cheap motel with different themes to choose from, the serene setting near Hiroshima, the Japanese costumes like the beautiful kimonos the heroine wears (Mariko played by Tao Okamoto), the samurais with their fight choreographies, the Japanese warrior and everything else that elevated The Wolverine into an unexpected and, why not, artistic side that I didn't expected to see in a movie inspired by a comic book. Expect to see even more Wolverine when X-Men: Days of Future Past comes to theaters in 2014. In the meantime, make sure not to miss The Wolverine, arguably the better Man of Steel we'll see this year. Sorry, Superman!",10,5,11,27 July 2013
50_50," 50/50
","I was reading the latest edition of Entertainment Weekly where they announce the Entertainers of the Year 2012. I glanced through the pages to find Ben Affleck, the cast of Homeland including Claire Danes and Damian Lewis, Jennifer Lawrence, Channing Tatum, Anne Hathaway until I came across Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He's a peculiar kind of actor that came out of nowhere until I noticed him in movies like Inception and Dark Knight Rises where he's gotten momentum and noticeability, luckily not the wrong kind of publicity that we've come to expect from other young actors (see Lindsay Lohan) but a good recognition for their good work instead of their personal lives.I read the article expecting to see his work on 50/50 which came out in 2011 but they only focused on The Dark Knight Rises and Looper (with Bruce Willis). Then I realized the title: Entertainers of the Year 2012. I prefer him in smaller films like 50/50 and 500 Days of Summer where his performance shines through. In 50/50, he plays a young man who discovers that he's got a rare life-threatening tumor and has a, you guessed it, 50/50 chance of surviving it. What I like most about the story is that, instead of being melodramatic and depressing, it turns out to be rather uplifting and, dare I say, funny. Based on the true story by Will Reiser, the film sees Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dealing with his cancer treatment on his own. His father suffers from Alzeihmer's and his mother (played by the always wonderful Anjelica Houston) is so overbearing and protective of him that he chooses to deal with his battle with cancer alone with little to no help from his detached girlfriend Rachael (played by Bryce Dallas Howard). His best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries his darnest to be very supportive of him but he doesn't realize that his friend is slowly but surely slipping away and he doesn't know how to cheer him up. His therapist (Anna Kendrick) is not very experienced on the matter either (she only has 2 other patients under her belt) thus Adam becomes very defensive and brutally honest with her: he's sick and tired of everyone telling him that whatever he's feeling is 'normal' , his attitude and mood swings 'understandable' under his condition. He's tired of everybody being so 'nice' when they learn about his condition yet nobody is really honest and upfront with him (except for Kyle who seems rather oblivious to the fact that his best friend has cancer). He wants somebody to have the guts to tell him that he may not be okay, that there's a chance that he may not make it and help him cope with that fact. I am glad that these movies gets made and they don't always have a Hollywood ending. I especially like the raw performance from Joseph Gordon Levitt that is deserving of an award or just recognition. He really holds the movie together by inviting us to look at how fragile one's life really is. There's a particular moment when we see Adam going for the eminent surgery that may either cure him or kill him quicker and, for a brief moment, he loses faith and needs somebody there for him. Luckily his mother is there and the moment is so brief yet so powerful that sends chills down my spine. I literally saw the fear in his eyes at the uncertainty that lay ahead of him. It's one of those moments that don't make it to the script but are worth 1,000 words.",8,4,6,3 January 2013
