Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," If you are a true fan, this can't be your favorite episode
","Now cmon, I agree with the many who have bravely voiced their disapproval of this movie. I feel much of what made the orginal trilogy special has lost in the technology and special effects. Instead of detailed models of starships and great looking costumes of startroopers and wookies, animation is now the overtone of this film. It has no human quality to it, with little attention paid to the character interaction and more of a DieHard or Leathal Weapon feeling. More attention was paid to that pathetic JarJar than Obi Wan... what is wrong with this picture?I have talked in chat rooms, and being only 21, I feel old. People are saying how it was so much better than the originals... now any REAL fan would know this simply isn't true. I feel a connection to these movies, having grown up with them. They opened the door of science fiction to me like no other movie could've done. They draw you in with their character development and human faces. I just simply could not identify with any off the charaters (or cartoons, depending on who we're talking about). They cheapened the movie experience with this new technology.I know many would say to me - Get with it, times are a changing. But it should be unlawful to desecrate a series such as Star Wars with this. The technology used in the originals was for their time period ground- breaking, original, and captivating. However, I don't see the new film as not even being  close to this status, being a cross between Star Wars and Toy Story.I voted this movie a 4 solely because it bears the name 'Star Wars'. The only thing I appreciated was seeing Yoda and the origins of Darth Vader. Otherwise... well, it saddens me. I just hope the next two make up for what this movie lacks.<ul><li>An old-school Die-hard Trilogy fan</li></ul>",4,0,1,5 June 1999
