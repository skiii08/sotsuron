The Blair Witch Project," Good but not as scary as the hype.
","This was a well-done, tense film, the kind a horror fan like myself would like to see more of.  But 'the scariest film ever made' it's not.  _The Shining_ is a much scarier film, to name one.  However, this is a very tight film, well shot, etc.  How they managed to spend $350,000 is beyond me--El Mariachi cost what, $13,000?One tip--see it after the buzz subsides, so you can be somewhat alone in the theatre--I'm sure it would be much spookier then.",7,1,1,22 July 1999
