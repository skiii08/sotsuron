The Rock," Quite watchable action flick
","I've seen this one twice - once in the movie theatre and once on TV. While there are undoubtly many better movies, even in its genre, this one holds up quite nicely. The main reason probably being the main characters which bring some substance to an otherwise trivial exercise.",6,5,7,7 August 2000
Cast Away," Good but not inspired 'star movie'. Too much FedEx
","Tom Hanks successfully carries this movie, which centers on a single character like few others for a large part of its time. It is an unabashed vehicle for Hanks. Still, I was less impressed with his performance (good, not great) than others on the Net. Helen Hunt is good as always, but finally does not really get a chance to display her skills fully. Like in Forrest Gump, I felt that serious moments were somewhat awkwardly acted - since I have seen better from both Hanks and Hunt in other movies, I'll blame the writing or director.In contrast to others, I did not feel this movie was 'disjointed', the very distinct parts make sense from the story-telling point of view and emphasize the experiences of the main character.All in all I enjoyed this movie and it lingered on for while, even though the heavy, heavy Fed-Ex exposure almost managed to spoil it for me.",6,1,1,21 February 2001
Con Air," Effective action amusement, cheesy story, hammy acting
",This one I skipped in the movies but actually have watched twice already on TV. It's close to a no-brainer but at least the action has entertainment value and keeps the movie from becoming boring. A real solid C movie. Final hint: just skip the very last scenes to avoid saccharine poisoning!,5,1,1,19 May 2003
The Terminal," Nice actors but far too much Hollywood
","Possibly I'm too critical of this movie, because it has a connection to a true story that is much more dramatic and strange. The start is nice enough with Viktor being trapped at the airport and trying to figure out what to do. But then a whole lot of Hollywood clich√©s come rolling in and even the good performances by many of the actors didn't quite save the movie from little mental groans in my head. It felt a bit as if the script writers and other movie makers had tried to recreate a feel-good movie from more innocent times. It surely worked for many people but did not quite work for me. Individual scenes made me laugh at loud, some others made me just wince slightly as another layer of sugary-sweet feel-good dressing was added to a formula recipe.",5,1,6,20 March 2009
Contact," A serious classic
","I'll try to be brief. This is quite simply one of the most intelligent SF movies - or movies in general - ever. Jodie Foster is great as the hard nosed scientist with realistic doubts and worries. The visuals are nice and this is one of the extremely rare movies that get their science and the portrait of scientists at work mostly right! It has a few shortcomings, like a bit too much schmaltz in places and some rushed developments, so for me it does not end up at the absolute top. But if you can digest a non-action SF with some actual thinking going on, treat yourself to an enjoyable and inspiring experience.",9,1,3,22 May 2003
