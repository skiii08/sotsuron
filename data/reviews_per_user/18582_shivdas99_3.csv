The Blair Witch Project," Go for the experience, not the movie.
","What makes this movie such a thrilling experience is the fact you never see the witch or mystical force in the forest playing tricks on these 3 students. You only see the tricks being played, and not consistently...but every now and then so it doesn't become repetitive but rather well timed and when you least expect or want it. The viewing through the camera gives it an unnerving realistic edge making you feel as if you are in the forest too or watching a real footage recorded by real people being tested, almost, by a real evil. All these factors collectively make the movie engaging, but not necessarily good. It is not the mark of a great movie at all, with the factors explain before acting almost comes at ease with almost able to play the part...the viewers aren't engaged with the actors necessarily but the whole array of noises, images and the general vibe the forest creates and vibe resulting from the relationship between the actors and the forest and 'witch'. This means sometimes the viewer will imagine noises which aren't even portrayed in the cinema. It is not really a movie in the sense of character and plot development, but rather an experiment to play on the audience. Perhaps that is why it is only just above an hour and nothing much really happens. The ending, itself, is also deliberately vague, giving open interpretation to the audience. Go for the experience, not the movie.",7,0,1,23 January 2008
The Dark Knight," rightly rated, nothing more, nothing less
","I give this movie a solid 8, which by no means matched the undeserved hype it has inevitably received. This is a solid summer epic, which proves to be a clever and exciting sequel to the successful Batman Begins. Nolan provides a dark, sinister and human insight into Batman, concluding that the Batman needs Joker and the Joker needs batman as they are actually rather similar- insecure, complex 'freaks' as the Joker says. Almost everyone had high expectations before watching this, eager to see the late Ledger's widely praised performance on screen. The movie starts of tense, fast and straight to the point, introducing all the characters in their different contexts accordingly. Zimmer's epic score lifts the movie to great proportions, you can't take your eyes off the screen. The plot is by no means original, but does does give great justice to each character and the interplay between them. Then comes the acting.. Bale provides the necessary humanistic subtelties and mannersisms in Bruce Wayne's character. He has great screen presence. AS Batman his voice is slightly off putting sometimes, but that is a minor flaw. Gyllenhaal is a necessary step up from Holmes, providing a sophisticated and elegant fit to Rachel's character. Eckhart is the right man for the job of Harvey Dent/2 Face. He is a good looking man thus making the 2 face character even more disturbing to view. The juxtoposition of his face to the monster's is incredible. He is a good actor too, but in this movie he really shines, managing to play the confident, suarve and profressional Dent with great ease. Oldman appears consistently throughout the film. I do feel he has acted better in other films, for example Leon. But to be fair in this film he doesn't need to immerse himself incredibly in the character. And then there's Ledger. I didn't see Ledger in the movie, i saw the Joker on screen. And for that there's nothing more i can see. If i see somebody completely different i know then he has trascended completely beyond the barriers of acting. Just sit back and enjoy what is the true Joker. Sorry Jack. All in all a fantastic movie which is rewatchable. Not only is it entertaining but dark, sinister, thrilling and sometimes emotional",10,2,11,14 August 2008
1408," In the same league as Jacobs ladder, the Machinist and Memento
","Firstly there are two main characters in this movie and the movie totally relies on these two main characters - 1408 the room and John Cusack. It is all about the interplay between these 2 central characters mentally and physically. So thank god Cusack acted to the hefty acting ability the nature of this movie demands.Secondly what is the definition of a horror movie these days? Good looking teenagers being chased by a stranger from an isolated part of the remote country? Lots of blood and the occasional jump and scream? Yes. Because in a generation of hostels and saws no one gets scared or disturbed in the true sense of the word. Everyone is just disgusted or shocked because of the gravity of the torture and the deaths. There is no pharmacologically effect brought, only a display a guts. 1408 is a hopefully the start of a fresh wave of horrors.Lastly i hope this movie makes you think. It is not just a horror but almost in the same league of the machinist, memento, spider and Jacobs ladder. The movie is dealing with a man whose lost his daughter, has a tricky relationship with his wife and has human qualities like arrogance and selfishness. We are dealing with a human here.Watch this.",9,1,2,16 September 2007
