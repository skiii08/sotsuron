Changeling," Great movie
","i thought this movie wasn't going to be that great. but when i watched it. it really amazed me. you should definitely go watch this movie i give it a 10-10 the plot and the acting was amazing. it was a really emotional movie. seeing the acting of Jolie really impressed me, i went to see this movies at the theaters and it was definitely worth the cash. if you feel bad about something in life and think your life sucks go see this movie because your mind will change. i cant believe was a true story the acting in the serial killer was amazing and the acting in the nurses police officers and kids was also really outstanding. they did a really good job representing the 20s'-30's.",10,4,6,13 February 2009
