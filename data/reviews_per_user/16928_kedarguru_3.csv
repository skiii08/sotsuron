Sucker Punch," lukewarm action porn
","I'll begin with a good analogy. You should know by now that every porno flick has the same formula – a terrible storyline, and hot scenes at every interval. You don't watch a porno for the story. You click 'forward' and get to the good parts. Why do they even need to have a story, you ask? To tie it all together, that's the only reason. This movie is action porn. The plot is so, so bad. I mean REALLY bad. If you pay attention to the plot, then you will feel lobotomized. When you see the first action scene, you will be amazed, and you may even feel that this was worth your time and/or money – but, don't let this fool you, my friend. They simply repeat the same action sequence, four or five times, under different conditions. Did I mention the story sucks? You'll just fantasize about the blond chick for two hours.",4,2,7,16 June 2011
The Da Vinci Code," Why do critics unanimously pan this movie?
","Critics have consistently called this a bad movie - the rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 25%, the director Ron Howard was nominated a Razzie for worst director, and the movie has been called one of the worst of 2006!I wouldn't call it bad - but it isn't exactly great. I'd say that, it is at least above average. I would not watch this movie again, but I didn't mind watching it the first time, and I didn't hate what I saw.One of the problems with the movie is that it's too long - about 2.5 hours - and that, during that time, there are long periods where nothing happens. In that sense, the movie can be boring to the point that you turn to daydreaming, or stop paying attention. The movie seems to piddle along.Another problem that I have with the movie is that, in some annoying scenes, the characters only speak in French, and you have no clue what is happening.Also, and I don't know if this is a problem with the movie or with the book, since I haven't read the book, but it seems that the plot to this movie and to Angels and Demons is an almost aimless drifting. Robert Langdon will discover an almost arbitrary thing, and then, through some very random string of arguments on esoteric history and signs, will come to a conclusion that is too absurd to believe, and yet is almost always correct.Nevertheless, I don't consider this a bad movie. I didn't pay close attention to every detail - I was multi-tasking on the computer - and so I wasn't bored. Honestly, I don't see how you can watch this movie without multi-tasking. It is interesting to see how the plot unfolds, and to learn about history and conspiracy. Things do happen, and while the plot can be a little unreal it still has the consistent flow, with a number of breaks, that you would expect in a mystery. It is not exactly a thriller in the sense that you are at the edge of your seat, although it does have those moments. I would not say that it is exactly a cerebral movie, but it is still interesting to think about. Overlooking the plot, I think that everything else about the movie was well-done. The musical composition, the camera work, the scenery.",6,0,2,22 June 2010
Inception," One of the Best Philosophical Movies
","Definitely the best philosophical/psychological thriller on film. With a big budget for special effects and casting, you wouldn't expect less.My only gripe with this, moreso than with other films of this genre, is that it seems to be an analogy gone overboard for the purpose of not only capturing the attention of intellectual audiences during the movie(you need a more limber brain to keep up with the erratic plot development), but for the purpose of intentionally keeping audiences thinking about what the hell happened after the film is over - because this is one of those movies that ends on an unclear tone, like Lost the series. In that way, it seems that much of the cat-and-mouse mental work you do to figure out the mystery throughout the film (is that a dream? is that real? etc) is wasted effort, and an easy way for script writers to ensure that they can get away with doing less to have viewers wanting more. It seems that the complexity of this dream world is deliberately contrived so that viewers can feel self-satisfied afterwards, thinking, 'Hey, that was complicated as hell. But I figured it out. I'm awesome, and this movie is awesome.'Beyond being a symbolic representation of the human psyche, the plot of the film is ridiculously silly. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I will say this: instead of entering into someone's dream to plant an idea like a cool secret spy with extraordinarily contrived plans with cool gadgets and stuff, why not just use hypnotic suggestion? Or, hell, why not clone the other person, or make a cyborg? As silly as that sounds, it's way more feasible than, well, the plot of this movie.All that aside, this is a good movie. If I were you, I would watch it. But, be in the mood, this isn't another brainless shoot-em-up.",7,1,5,31 October 2010
