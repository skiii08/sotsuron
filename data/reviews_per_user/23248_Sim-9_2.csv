Raiders of the Lost Ark," Exquisite
","As sheer entertainment, Raiders must rank as one of the greatest films in history - that chase scene may never be equaled. In my opinion this is Speilbergs best work. So there.",10,0,0,29 March 1999
Armageddon," An example of what is wrong with movies today.
","Armageddon is one of the worst summer 'event' movies yet this decade. It's main problem is one that runs constant throughout Hollywood. Bad directors with no imagination. The emotional edge is tacked on in such a way that it comes across as blunted: one feels nothing. We don't even feel happy when Bruce Willis dies (because we are glad to see the back of him). For me there was nothingness.The editing is the worst that I have ever seen. It appears as though the editor, wanted to break the world record for most shots in a film. No one take must last more than 10 seconds. When it is done right (i.e. Raiders of the Lost Ark, the end sequence in Taxi Driver), the editing can astound. In this film however it nearly gave me a headache. One dizzying sequence of events moved to another, until in Popeye like fashion, I proclaimed 'I can't stand no more'.In better, more considered hands, Armageddon may have become a classic of it's kind. As it is however, it's main function of existence should probably be as a lesson to filmmakers in how NOT to make a summer blockbuster.",4,0,1,28 September 1999
