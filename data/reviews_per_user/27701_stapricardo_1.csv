10 Cloverfield Lane," it is OK
",the movie starts to slow. more like another of that kind movie. Evenstopped the first time watching. but after a hint from a friend i watched it again. and it is worth the wait. i still have some unsolved issues like a woman who seem (SPOILERRRRRR) to be infected and dies and later the main character discovers there is no infection going on. what happened with the first woman?? but it is a good movie but not the best of its kind. i liked the original Cloverfield that much that this must be gold to make it impress. and it doesn't good try. acting is very good. you love and hate the main guy. also the idea of being somewhere you doesn't know anything is very hard and cruel. and the mind games will let you think.,7,0,1,8 November 2016
