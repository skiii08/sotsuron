Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The movie is disgusting
","Sure, the movie is highly amusing. Many people have not even heard of the country Kazakhstan and decide it's okay to laugh at the horrid exaggerations and false portrayals of the Kazakh culture. It truly is a downright shame to disrespect another culture in such a way. I myself have been to Kazakhstan and the movie sends an extremely false image of Kazakhstan through the media. There's news that Kazakh officials have invited 'Borat' over to Kazakh to see the nation for himself.'I understand that the feelings of many people are hurt by Cohen's show,' he said. 'But we must have a sense of humor and respect the creative freedom of others.' (quoted from a news article)A sense of humor is fine and so is respect for creativity. But the blatant false portrayal of a nation is disgusting. It's okay to enjoy a movie and a parody of certain aspects of a culture. The fact of the matter is, many people are going to watch the movie and not think twice about the 'things they learned' and accept the movie for what it is. How many people can actually say they've been to Kazakhstan and they know that the culture is not what it is shown to be in the movie?",1,32,127,19 October 2006
