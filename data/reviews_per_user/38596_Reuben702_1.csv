Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What an incoherent pile of crap
","George Lucas failed at every point of film making with this movie. This movie has no narrative coherence, or foundations. The basic foundations for a movie are simply not present here, there is no main character, no interesting characters and most of all, an incoherent plot. If you actually try to pay attention to anything said in this movie you will notice that it makes absolutely makes no sense at all. Every sentence of dialog contradicts what was said before it and for a movie which is made for kids, it is seriously boring. George Lucas seems to think that special effects are more important than plot and characters and while the special effects may look good, they drain all the life out of the movie. He tries to make locations which look vast and open but the actors are obviously on a very narrow platform. This whole movie seems to be about cramming as much crap on the screen as possible. George Lucas, please, please stop re-releasing this crap.",1,5,11,1 May 2012
