Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars is a great example of how computer graphics can get way over done.
","Star Wars is a great example of how computer graphics can get way over done. For example, Jar Jar Binks. Not only is this character utterly annoying and nonsensical to the plot; the main problem with this character is that you KNOW that he is completely digitally created. He just didn't seem real. And how many times have you been caught looking at the background special effects, than the actual character interactions in front of you? Despite such flaws, the movie is very enjoyable and I am happy to see another Star Wars movie. The climatic fight scene at the end with Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul should not be forgotten as I consider it the most awesome fight scene in all of cinema. Even though the computer effects are over done, the visuals are amazingly innovative and spectacular. Natalie Portman's (Queen Amidala) acting is notably great despite lukewarm acting by the others. And defying all logic, there's just something about Star Wars that evokes a certain glee and adventurous spirit within me. Maybe it's the force.Grade: A-",Null,0,0,1 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," This is really a cool, creepy movie!
","Much talk has been said about the ending. I watched the movie about four weeks after the initial release and although I didn't know how the movie would end, I tried to expect that unexpected ending. Well, did I see it coming? No! The ending just threw me off my seat and this alone makes the movie worth watching. Sixth Sense is frightening and definitely unpredictable. Although there are seemingly a lot of plot-holes, the sequences were delivered cleverly and logically. This is really a cool, creepy movie!Outstanding and Innovative. A suspenseful and thought-provoking movie with originality and great direction. A must-see!",Null,0,0,1 November 1999
