Black Swan," If filmmakers know what they're doing, they understand that SUBTLETY is everything
","If the audience is observant enough, and if the filmmaker masters every moment available in front of the camera (mis en scene, dialogue, etc.) then the cinematic experience will be far more than enjoyable. This review is more like an analysis; more like tips on how you might interpret viewing this film.Natalie Portman's role as Nina is flawless if she set out to convey an innocent, naive, yet spiritually distraught female who puts her work before her well-being. But more than her work is her love for her mother: like a defeated puppy who upsets the master, Nina squints every time she feels an urge to be herself. If this is what Aronofsky wanted of Portman, then hand her the Oscar. We see a broken woman in front of a mirror, reflected in different angles, portraying a divided human being. The camera follows Nina behind her, viewing nothing but the back of her head and maybe a foot or two beside her, and far into the distance in front of her in a blur. What does this mean? That we are following a woman who wishes to see nothing around her (why? I took it as because she was fearful of her surrounding). She sees her own face on the bodies of other women, fearing that her own worst enemy is staring her down, waiting for her to fail. This leads to paranoia, and inevitably insanity. Like I said before, if all of this was meant as such, then Portman and Aronofsky did a beautiful job. So when the end came it is no wonder one is drowned in a flood of emotions. Sympathy turns to compassion, turns to despair, turns to relief.Since the story is told especially through Nina's eyes, all the characters in the film merely reflect her psyche. They do not have their own personal lives because however they come into the film is just a reflection of how Nina feels about them, and therefore herself. I have nothing to complain about the performances. I even have to congratulate them for being exactly what the film needed them to be. Especially the mother, who (as it seemed to me anyway) hid beneath her a painful interior of regret seeking redemption, but doing it in all the wrong ways through suppressing her daughter's potential not as a dancer, but as a woman, and thus a human being. The score leads the audience into the territory where the film wants you in. In one instant you will be enjoying the beauty of ballet, and the next will be concerned whether what you just heard was real, and therefore are experiencing exactly what Nina is. For me, music is a guide, a leader to follow. The better hold music has on you, the more deeper into its atmosphere you'll find yourself in-- whether pleasurable or terrifying. Clint Mansell accomplishes both.All in all, one needs to ask, What does a movie need to do for it to accomplish 10/10? Pessimists will say that nothing deserves a perfect score; so in their view their favourite viewing experiences deserve 9/10. So what about that tenth star? Does it exist merely as the impossible carrot to chase? No, that tenth is there to congratulate the whole film cast for making such a cinematic experience that it doesn't set itself as a great movie, but it reflects the necessity of which is in everyone-- that being, Let go and Give in to your darker nature.",10,0,3,29 December 2010
Terminator Salvation," Just watched it on Bluray, and I have to say... it isn't so bad after all
","The only reason why this film did not earn the extra 3 stars, in my opinion, is solely because of the screenplay and the leaked ending. When the dialogue was in play, it wasn't cheesy- which is hard to do. But there just WASN'T ENOUGH! Everybody was/is criticizing McG on his work. And I should admit that I did too. But watching the Director's cut, I really do have to admit that McG did a tremendous job with what he was working with. The visuals of TS are just phenomenal-- he successfully captures a world destroyed by nuclear war and on the brink of losing its humanity. However, he could only do so much with the script he is handed. I say: give him a script penned by, say, James Cameron, Chris/Jon Nolan, Michael Mann, or whoever else that isn't B-class and McG could create an outstanding film.Additionally, the ending. Yes it was corny only because people ruined it for the writers and director. I, as a hardcore Terminator fan, would have loved it for its irony. The leaked ending was that Marcus wore dead John Connor's skin, and the Resistance went on thinking it was Marcus who died and not John. Marcus- unaware of Kyle being John's father- would have raised Kyle like his younger brother, grooming him to be a good fighter. Kyle would have admired him as his role model. Hence, Marcus/John's skin sends his right hand man back through time to save John Connor's mother. This would have been perfect, yet the leaker ruined it for us fans. I also truly believe that McG and better writers could have SUCCESSFULLY turned this story from John Connor's prophecized leadership to Marcus' true role in the war against the machines. But when it comes down do it, his bosses (producers) hired mediocre writers and were not keen enough on securing information. It is really evident that McG does have a passion for the Terminator franchise.Sound- superb. Plot- like I said, kind of slow with lack of dialogue, and some parts in the story heavily relied on coincidence and chance. Blame the producers and writers, not the visual artist. Rehire McG but hire somebody who will give him something worth his salt.",7,1,2,3 December 2009
Shutter Island," This movie accomplished what it sought out to do
","exemplary scene: Teddy is lying in bed, and suspects Cawley of conspiring against him. Then his partner replies, 'Think he's bluffing?' Teddy responds, with a disgruntled look on his face, 'I didn't say that.'As he turns his head to sleep, it is almost like he wants to ignore and even forget what his partner said. Dreaming sequence begins. He looks depressed for killing people in the war, his wife lectures him on drinking. This is what he was thinking about going to bed, and it manifested in his dream. As soon as his subconscious kicked in, he recognized that this reality was not the truth. Then, very smoothly, the scenery of the location transformed into a totally different one. The hidden truth reveals itself slowly to him, in very subtle signs. As the plot progresses, the truths of his existence will come forward to him when he is ready to face it. Whether he loses or finds himself is up to you to witness. And what more, is that as you watch this phenomenon, you cannot help but examine your own life the same way. We turn away from the truth most of the time, most of the time we prefer the smooth road. But this is our cowardly nature, to give up the fight before it has started. And this we will not admit to ourselves- we are too proud. So we believe delusions to get us through our day. :) Happy Smiles...This movie strikes at the existential level, and helps to reveal to you your true nature, that you are multi-layered and there are levels of which you have not stepped in. These places are the memories that we keep prisoner in the back of our heads so that we, our soul, our conscience, our decision maker, is blinded from their confessions. We don't want to face the truth. I'd say that Scorcese succeeds in doing what his movie means to do- make you feel as insane as Leaddis",10,0,2,4 May 2010
Drive," Character only known as 'Drive'
","It's not a spoiler to say that you never hear the name of Ryan Gosling's character in the film. Yet the fact that the title is called 'Drive' signifies for me that this film isn't dealing with labels or identities. In watching this film, we are experiencing pure drivenness through the eyes of the protagonist.I won't go into the detailed mechanics of the production, even though I thought Refn did a stand-up job. The filming is careful and the music tells you how you should feel. Sometimes I felt that I was engaging in a crime drama, only to be switched to a romance, then to a horror film. And, yes, this film in a particular scene is shot as if it paid homage to the horror genre (at least this is what I felt anyway). Then again, it's almost like I'm watching a thriller from the retro age of the 80's. Yet the language, clothing and cars obviously reflect today. This film, therefore, is a harmonious splicing of genres, mixing action scenes from gangster flicks to engine thrills. The thing that got me the most out of this mixing of genres is how Refn does it: the camera angles seem so strangely and originally ordered that it's impossible to tell what'll happen next. Indeed, there came a time when I wondered what time it was, yet I intentionally refused to look at my watch-- God forbid I miss something important. And that is the thing with 'Drive': unexpected things happen not exactly to give you cheap thrills, but I think it's the central theme to elicit the spontaneity of sudden impulses and instincts.To be sure, the film hasn't much of a plot. The dialogue is even lightly dosed into the script, as you'll see upon viewing. But this is one of those films where the setting, cinematography, sound mixing, and the music tell the story. It's more sensual than most films, yet it still retains its intellectual dignity. As such, sensual films usually run the risk of raping your hearing and visual capacities(hence SENSUAL); but 'Drive' makes itself known to the viewer more so as philosophical experience than a basic thrill ride. Gosling does a superb job at conveying this quality, for upon viewing this movie I expected to see how the heart-throb cliché will be abused; yet his aloof manner is utilized to surprise even the most learned of audiences. You'll know what I mean when you see it.",Null,1,3,27 September 2011
Children of Men," This movie CHANGED me...
","I apologize for the seemingly unnecessary cliché of describing a work of art, but I have not had a cinematic experience like this one...I watched this film a few years ago. I appreciated it for its action, and metaphor on humanity coming to a close. But other than that this movie had no effect on me. Only when I started to study existentialism, absurdism, and themes in global issues did I start to open my perception on REAL evils in the world. And, no, humankind ending is NOT the greatest evil...If you can grasp that, then you already understand this movie. The trailer promotes it as a futuristic sci-fi with intense scenes and renowned actors. Yet the experience of Children of Men takes the viewers on a wholly different level of politics, literature, poetry, and spirituality. I will not waste your time putting this film on a pedestal (although it deserves much more) I will take the liberty of this review to describe the film through a few exemplary scenes which stand out most:We are introduced to a (not so improbable) country run by a wealthy minority who controls all aspects of life. Some aspects that struck me most were the use of Quietus (a government funded suicide kit to 'help' people out of their misery); Theo's affluent cousin who keeps his son (who, from the looks of the tattoos on his neck, looks like he was a former rebel without a cause, so to speak) sedated, lives in the most extreme case of self-centeredness; and one particular sign that orders citizens to turn in those who do not take fertility tests; the burning crop and farming fields; just to pick a few from many. Nevertheless, the responsibility that we, the viewers, have is to take the important lesson from the film: to never give up hope, and keep fighting for it with all the faith you can muster. Not only is this film greatly shot and edited but is one of the most important forms of theatre I've had the good fortune to come across.",10,1,7,28 April 2010
Inception," Nolan: a Master in the Craft of Screen writing
","If you choose to watch this film, let me warn you: it is NOT for the average movie-goer. It is complex, urging the audience to remember what scene just passed. It uses psychological terms, hoping that the audience is intelligent enough to understand where it is going.If you can pass all of those tests, then you will immensely enjoy this film. I don't know where to begin describing it. If you want me to start with the score, I'll simply say it is flawless. Although music may have been overplayed (downplaying the ambiguity of particular scenes) Hanz Zimmer should enter the ranks of Mozart and Beethoven with it. The action is smoothly directed, and Nolan proves to be improving exponentially. The acting couldn't have been better. I didn't scoff at any poorly made comment because they didn't occur. Every word spoken was for a purpose and not one second of screen time was wasted. Brilliant performances of Leo DiCaprio for demonstrating his deep dedication to the role; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an up and coming actor with much promise; same goes with Ellen Page, Tom Hardy (the amazing Bronson); Ken Watanabe; Cilian Murphy; Marion Cotillard; and all others. Especially with DiCaprio's character, Cobb. Just mesmerizing.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) But the component I am eager to boast is the drama. Whoever says this movie has no emotion has clearly not contemplated the delicacy of familial bonds. What drives the main character, Cobb, is his love for his family. Nolan makes this movie a love story intertwined into the vastly complex universe of the mind and subconscious. How did he do it? Simple: spend 10 years composing the script, and you might, too, come up with a geniusly crafted work. 'Inception' and the famous quote about the 'idea as parasite' play at the backbone of the plot, and its final result is not only a warning of an idea's power, but an example that an original idea can change the world. I believe that this film will change people's minds about their own dreams, and thus the global population have made one step closer to being more attuned to themselves- thanks to Christopher Nolan.",8,5,11,17 July 2010
