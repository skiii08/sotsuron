The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not the best of the series but holds the standards that The Hunger Games put!
","When Lionsgate told us that the Mocingjay book is going to be split into two films I was very curios about how the part one will look-like and when I saw it I was very satisfied!The movie is not the best of the three i must say, but this movie gives the franchise a meaning and explains us the political side of war and how a leader or a symbol can unite us - and that is what the movie is mostly about! The first 40 minutes of the movie lacks of action but i wasn't surprised or disappointed because also in the first two films we don't get to see a real action till the games start. The movie's plot surrounds especially about the propagandas that the rebels make with Katniss that shows a different aspect of Jennifer's acting which i was very impressed by the way!In my opinion there are 2 reasons why this movie is good: First, the actors are acting great in this film especially Jennifer's. Second, the plot is not boring like a lot of people say! the few action scenes are powerful and thrilling - which I didn't really feel in the first two movies. And the political information that we get about the war is also very interesting ! For example, we can see that all the real attacks are sort of planed by district 13, we can see it when right after every scene with Katniss's propaganda we see the rebels attack by Katniss lines or even singing.All in all, The Hunger Games Mocingjay P.1 succeed to reach the franchise's high level and in some scenes even to transcend it! if you liked the previous films most likely you will like it also!",10,2,5,31 July 2015
The Finest Hours," The Boring Hours
","I usually like most of the movies that I see in the theaters(even the low-rated ones),but in this movie something new happened to me,I slept for 10 minuets,something that never happened to me before. I believe that I got to this situation for two reasons.First,the plot wasn't been managed well.For example,the HYPE scenes where you actually thrilled are too short and involved with bad effects that makes you not comfortable and bored.Second,except Chris Pine and Holliday Grainger the acting was very bad and not convenience enough something that made feel not emotionally connected with the characters. Also,the dynamic between the actors didn't satisfied me.I truly don't understand why this movie is so well rated,it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,almost no action,no intense or interesting plot. Don't go to this movie! Ido Yam",2,24,51,4 February 2016
Inside Out," Almost Perfect - 9.2
","Inside Out takes place into Riley's emotions and show us what happens inside your head when you have sort of crisis. Or in this case - moving to a new city.On the one hand,the movie has a lot of tiny problems that ruins the chance to give it a 10. For example, there were few times that i was bored or already know what is coming next. And I wasn't the only one. Also my cousins who are much younger than me felt like this. This shouldn't happen if the movie's goal is to be perfect!Another great example is that in my opinion they didn't focus enough about the emotions and how they function in a different situation-before Riley moved to a new city and the twist started. I wanted to see a lot more about Riley's life and friends.On the other hand, this film is fantastic by many aspects, the movie built a new interesting world that i was very curios and interested to learn about.Also,the movie succeed to make the audiences feel connected to the characters and off-course almost all of the movie had an interesting plot.In conclusion,the movie has a few little problems that ruins the chance to give it a 10 But also a lot of amazement,funny and sophisticated scenes that you suddenly almost forget about the issues that you had with the movie.",7,6,29,1 August 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Forget The Reviews - Get Your Own Opinion.
","Batman Vs Superman Review:One of the most anticipated film of the year has finally arrived and has brought with it tons of action,darkness but also a lot of wasted scenes.The film starts from batman's point of view of what happened in the end of Man Of Steel, a scene that builds the suspense between Bruce Wayne(Batman/Ben Affleck) and Clark Kent(Superman/Henry Cavill).From the first scenes I've noticed that it's not only a battle between the most heroic characters in DC's universe,but also a comeback to this whole universe,and that is why this movie is so long,most of the first hour had a mix of scenes that were only been put to build up the entire universe again,it was interesting but too long.After the universe has been built the tension got higher and the scenes got more exciting,Batman wears his suit and the scenes started to contain more action than the first hour,but I must say that the 'real' scenes start way after I was waiting for,it felt like a gym that being too much chewed and right before the taste fades you buy a new one and thing are tasty again.And finally the battle arrived - in fact, a 10 minutes fight...Batman and Superman had a visually stunning fight that gave me chills....but,the main battle comes right after(with no spoils)the real exciting battle is when Gal Gadot arrives and I won't tell you why...(Watch Trailer 2 if you can't wait)In summary:The Good: Gal Gadot as Wonder WomanThe stunning comeback of DC's universeBen Affleck as BatmanAmazing Action Scenes(especially at the end)The Bad:Too longSome Boring scenesZack Snyder - 100% that he has passion for 'bullets that fall on the floor' scenes,too much mess in the first hour,he should have done it better.Not Good Not Bad:Henry Cavill - don't like how he acts but he is not bad.Jesse Eisenberg - 100% potential 75% performance. Annoyed me in a lot of scenes but played well in most of them.Expected for more.Overall: 8.5 -Ido Yam-",7,2,6,25 March 2016
Deadpool," Boring Plot,Excellent Jokes
","Deadpool Joke, another joke and dic* jokes, this can summarize the plot of the movie that doesn't have a plot but covers it with tons of jokes.I usually go with non expectations to comedies movies because they are usually bad but for this one I went with 100% expectations for two reasons. 1)it's a Super-Hero movie 2)It has a very high rating almost everywhere.The result, boring scenes and lots of funny jokes, in my opinion this movie is especially for US citizens because the jokes are based on their culture.To truly like this movie you need to reduce expectations to a 3 star movie and you will enjoy it like it was a 4 star movie or more.Finally, the movie is funny and has a satisfying amount of action but too long and too boring plot. 7/10 -Ido Yam-",7,1,8,19 March 2016
Minions," Very dumb But Also Very Enjoyable!
","Minions is the third movie in a trilogy (first were Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2).however its occurs before the events in the first two films.I did not have many expectations coming into the movie â€“ and apparently that was good. The movie has no cleverness or sophistication. The plot makes no sense and the jokes are simply not funny.I guess The Minions can be somewhat enjoyable if you come with the right, silly mood. Otherwise, this movie is not for you.Minions Movie Score: 7.1 for making me laugh of being very stupid. Ido Yam.",7,1,1,8 August 2015
