Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," so much raw material
","This film contains so much raw material that I am just dying to remake it as a movie, instead of an MTV theme park.  I'm just sad that Lucas didn't.  I hope he'll take heed of that criticism (not mine, it comes from all corners) and make II with more attention to pace, lyricism, and mystery.  Still, a fun romp and actually better on second viewing, I found.",6,0,1,21 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A storytelling worth many viewings and interpretations
","I went because some local review ran something like, 'Fast kickin', high jumpin', and good actin'!'Certainly all of that was true, but there was also a lyricism and magic about this film that was totally unexpected and totally overwhelming.  It's James Bond and Raiders of the Lost Ark woven into a mythical and rich story to be told in beautiful images.  The story itself obviously left lots of room for personal interpretation (the person I saw it with disagreed on some major points), and all of that is to say nothing of the value of the resonances in other myths and, I'm sure, other Chinese literature.A 'must see again and again', I can wholeheartedly recommend this film.  I rank it up there with the most truly invigorating stories I've ever heard. 
P.S. I'd also bet it was made on less than $10 MM.  Way to go Hong Kong Cinema for using technology and a storyteller's art to build something cool at a reasonable price.",10,0,0,3 January 2001
Mission: Impossible II," as cool as it needed to be
","People complain about the love story or the cruise-centric nature of the film.  Me, I expected and enjoyed all of that.  There are some great action sequences, enough cool gags/tech thingies to reward you for all of the suspension of belief, and it was classic, high-style John Woo, but hey, that's what it is supposed to be.  It made me glad I had seen Face Off, so that I could be ready for another Woo film with out-there plot and pretty colors.  Don't complain to me that Epcot is not as real you thought it would be.  Motorcycle chases are cool.",7,0,0,24 May 2000
