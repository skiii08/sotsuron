Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An insult to movie making and comedy and all things human.
","Having heard great stuff about this movie and how funny it is, i was disappointed from the very first shot of Borat when he says 'My name is Borat, I like sex.. is good' . that first dialog clearly illustrated that a very stupid and childish brain has has been at work behind this movie. and as i watched further it became clear that there were plenty of stupid childish brains behind this movie. most people have said it reflects on America's ignorance towards other cultures but i think only people who find this movie disgusting will realise that. those who find it funny will no doubt have very poor taste. Jews, Christians, Kazakhs, Muslims and HUMANS of all kind should stay away from this sort of movie simply because watching it will give,through box office receipts, encouragement to upcoming disgustingly degraded humor based movie makers to make a movie like this. And yes, the movie does reflect on America's own cultural failures such as Borat telling incest based stories and making out heavily with his sister in Kazakhstan while L.A. keeps producing beastiality and incest movies, you don't have to go so low to illustrate that point. All people involved in making this sort of movie should just quit while they can. It wasn't even funny man!? I mean is that all this movie is about?! Sick, sex, Anti-Semite, racist, perversion based jokes?! This movie is an insult to movie making.",1,4,10,31 July 2007
