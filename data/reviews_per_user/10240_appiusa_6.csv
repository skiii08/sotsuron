The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Better than I thought
","This movie was not amazing, and it was not one of the best movies I have ever seen, however, I really enjoyed watching it. I felt a bit skeptical to watch it, however, the way that all of the characters feelings are portrayed in this movie is just excellent. The 3 main characters played their roles really well and I really enjoyed it. To be honest, I thought it was going to be a stereotypical high school drama with all the key factors such as fitting in, making friends, having fun, and essentially, that is a big part of this movie, however the way it was directed and acted out by the characters was, in my opinion, really good.",8,0,1,16 January 2015
Gravity," One of the worst movies I have ever seen, with awesome special effects
","I had a lot of high hopes for this movie when I watched the trailer and really thought it might be good. Boy oh boy, I couldn't have been more wrong.I cannot believe this movie has received so much credit from the media. If you compare this to other movies in the same genre, aka 2001: A Space Odyssey, the Alien movies, close encounters of the third kind. OK, maybe you say it's not fair to compare it to those movies, but even a movie like Moon was better. The only good thing about this movie was the visual effects. This movie has some of the best special effects I have ever seen in a space film, however the rest of the movie is horrific to say the least. The biggest mistake they made was putting Sandra Bullock as the main character. Someone like Sigourney Weaver, Noomi Rapace or even a less popular actor would have played a much better role. The acting was bad, there was no real or interesting storyline, the characters wasn't interesting, just nothing.Don't believe the hype !",1,1,4,9 January 2015
Fury," I was not disappointed.
","I am not going to go into too many details. In many ways, this is not the most realistic or the best 'war' movie, however it was directed very well in my opinion. The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that I wish it was longer, however, it's almost 2 and a half hours long which is long enough.With that being said, I have to say, each scene that was shot felt just right. Each scene, in my opinion, had meaning and was directed really good. I enjoy long shots in stead of short fast shots. The shots were mostly long and a lot of attention to detail was put into each scene and shot. This is usually where most movies fall short, however, in this movie, you can see they really planned each scene and shot carefully.I must admit, I am not a big fan of Brad Pitt. The only decent movie he ever played in in my opinion was fight club, so I was a bit sceptical at first. However, this was probably one of his best performances ever. All the characters worked really well together and played their roles really good.To conclude, the movie left me wanting more and I was satisfied until the very end. It was not a waste of my time and although not as good, I would put it right next to other war themed movies such as Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket.",8,3,7,26 January 2015
Nightcrawler," unique story, great performance.
","I always enjoy movies that Jake Gyllenhaal plays in. And again, Nightcrawler is no different.This movie brings a new and unique story to the table that showcases a very interesting character played really well by Jake Gyllenhaal and an interesting story. This really shows the diverse roles he can act out and again, I was just stunned.From the start of the film to the very end, the main character keeps on surprising you. I remember thinking to myself during some of the scenes if there really are people like this out there. However, even though the character might be a little psychotic, I still think there is a lot one can learn from his attitude and capitalism or entrepreneurship in general, showing how hard work, dedication and sacrifice can really pay off.Overall, the movie was great, the acting of the main character was spot on and the story was interesting. Not a waste of time at all.",7,1,1,1 February 2015
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A must see with an interesting plot and character development.
","The Bridge on the River Kwai is an excellent movie and definitely one of the best of it's time. Yes, it's another world war 2 story, however, it's completely different from all the rest and shows us some of the events that took place elsewhere during this time of war.As many of you probably know, this movie is based on real life events. In many ways, I believe that the message being portrayed throughout the film shows us the 'other' harsh realities of war, not just soldiers dying in battle, but soldiers fighting to survive under harsh conditions, the pride of a captain who stands by his code, the pride of a Japanese captain and overall how both parties realise that war is what it is and we have to make the best out of each situation to survive.When I first decided to see this movie, I thought it was going to be very mediocre and plain. It was not. On several occasions they managed to keep the plot interesting and create new character developments from both the leading actors as well as the supporting actors that made the story enjoyable to watch. And on a final note, you can really tell that they tried to put a lot of detail and 'special effects' into their shots which is impressive for the time.Don't miss out on this one.",7,0,1,23 March 2015
The Thin Red Line," great cinematography, average movie with bad acting
","The thin red line was a great movie, however there were a couple of things that was just not up to par for me.Let me start with the bad things. First of all, the acting was just terrible 80% of the time. This might be a combination of bad actors or bad script here and there, however, some of the lines were extremely cheesy and most of the lines/audio sounded like the volume of the dialogue was pulled down at the end, so i.m.o you have to listen very carefully, or else you will not hear the last word a character says. Another thing that was really terrible to bear was the fact that about 90% of the soldiers there were not willing to fight, scared out of their pants and had a cry face on the whole time. When someone had to go scout or flank or basically do anything, there was always a long silence before someone would actually man up and volunteer. No one wanted to fight for their country, they all looked like a bunch of cry babies. Fair enough, it's war, but still, they knew what they were getting themselves into. Not one guy stood up and said something like 'alright men, let's show these Japanese what were made of!' Instead, they all looked like they were about to cry. And it's not like they were heading for Normandy, they were basically fighting a few squads of Japanese soldiers that took a large part of the island. Also, the movie didn't really focus on a particular person or group, instead it focused on some individuals and the rest of the troops, giving very little back story of any character and it feels like there is no real point of conclusion. They could have just shot all the beautiful scenes and had text appearing that displayed the narrator's words. I get what they tried to achieve throughout the movie and the message they wanted to portray, however the rest of the movie has no point. there is no conclusion other than the message from the narrator. There is no character's story, no real storyline except the narrators words.In any case, besides that, there were also a couple of positive things. The photography and cinematography was excellent. Some of the best shots I have seen in any 'war' movie. Again, they probably received an Oscar for best picture and if they didn't they should have, because the shots of the soldiers moving through the windy grasslands, or moving through the jungle were really good. One or two actors had maybe a few decent lines and the music was good.To conclude, this movie had a lot of potential. The overall theme and message of the movie was clear, the cinematography and shots were just brilliant, however cheesy lines, bad acting and soldiers scared out of their socks about war just ruined it for me.",6,0,3,3 February 2015
