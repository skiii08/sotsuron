Catch Me If You Can," A great movie with a good rythm
","This is a movie that made me really leave the theater in a good mood. The characters are very well drawn, particularly Frank, which is very suited for Leonardo, with all his versatile talent. There are some moments in the movie that really funny and the rythm of the movie makes the two hours pass in a no-time. The music is quite good as well.All in all, the movie depicts how two persons apparently playing cat and mouse with each other can end up as the biggest of allies and also how a frightened kid can do the most outstanding things just to get by, live his fantasies, and try to bring his parents back together in the meantime.A great movie.",9,1,2,17 February 2003
Fight Club," Violently blunt about life
","This movie exposes with an intricate setting the conditionalism people are willing to go in order to have a 'safe', controlled and expectable life.Yet, when a release is offered in the form of an unofficial fight club, thousands of people fed up with their dull, meaningless, and regular, average lifes, there is no hesitation in moving to a more carefree if yet violent life.It is an excellent film.",10,0,1,22 September 2002
The Fifth Element," Beautifully made
","I personally think this movie is one the great films of the last decade. It is the template by which 'futuristic' films (not really sci-fi) should guide themselves; it is a good exercise in extrapolating the current situation and imagining a future out of it, full of nice little details such as the MacDonald's in the sky.It is beautifully shot, and showcases the absolute mastery of the visual effects department (let's not forget this is one of most important aspects for such kind of picture), and other details like Donizetti's music during the extravagant opera scene and the costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier add to a very unique and appealing image.The storyline, though nothing great, is quite accomplished nevertheless.Finally, let's not forget the lovely Milla Jovovich is present, and for her I'm sure even the most hardened of critics will change his mind....",8,0,1,11 September 2002
Romeo + Juliet," Great flair and brightness, but not a very good idea.
","Yes, I must admit this movie is extraordinarily fast-paced, bright, and attractive. Cinematography and sound track all great a great visual experimente, as in Moulin Rouge.However, the idea of the movie seems weird and a bit outlandish. One thing, you stay absolutely true to the Shakespearan original plot, cenarios, etc. (but obviously it wouldn't appeal to the public it set out to appeal) or you do a modern adaptation and bring the story to a modern context.The idea of reading 16th century baroque dialogues while shootings go on and fast cars roam just seems extremely strange and intriguing. It just feels like an unfortunate mix Shakespeare's undisputed prestige and action movie's undeniable attraction that doesn't really work that well.The two things are simply very different. It's like olive oil and water: they just don't mix no matter what you do or how hard you shake them.Still, worth a good look.",6,0,0,23 September 2002
American Beauty," A modern classic
","I'm glad to a see a luso-descendant made such a great movie, which I probably rate highest of those films I had the time to watch in the big screen.The movie is an interesting and profound look into the banalities of suburban life (or life as a whole); middle-class living in a american suburbs (in european suburbs generally lower classes live); a topic that is fast becoming a modern clichÃ©, but is wisely exploited in this movie, with a good plot and an ironic sense of humor.Technically, both the cinematography and the soundtrack are very big pluses.A must not miss.",10,0,0,15 September 2002
Spirited Away," One of the best movies I ever saw
","This movie took my breath away. Everything, from humour, storyline, to the characters and backgrounds, was absolutely perfect, with the possible exception of the soundtrack.Chihiro meets the most fantastical creatures and gods in her quest to reclaim her parents transformed into pigs for eating the food meant for the gods. At the same time, her love story with Haku is charming in its progression; the little fur balls down in the boiler were very cute as well. The movie is, I'm sure, very enjoyable to any children, it took me right back to being a kid watching The Lion King again. yet, for an adult, the movie can also be perceived and enjoyed in many different planes. I can't make any more comemnts on this movie, and as with all masterpieces, you'll have to see it for yourself.",10,1,2,17 March 2003
