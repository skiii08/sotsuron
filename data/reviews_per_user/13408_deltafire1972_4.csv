Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Breath-taking, action packed and WOW!!
","If you love action movies with a touch of suspense, this film is the one to see. We saw it twice, and would see it a dozen more times.This one is far better than the first, and I hope they make a third. The year is just beginning and this film should be one of the top of the year.The action scenes seem more crisp that the first one and less choppy. We did not see this one in 3D the two times we saw it, but this film will be worth waiting in line for at midnight to buy when it comes out to DVD.Sherlock Holmes is brilliant with the witty humor. Watson is the brilliant side kick on his witty come backs. The fast paced graphics still could use a little more polish, but if there was a movie since Avatar I can say I was blown away on, it would be this one.",10,1,2,20 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Good but not the best (split review)
","Out of the series so far, this one is the worst. The 3D version I am glad I did not see. By all accounts it was horribly done. My fiancée loved it and wanted more, For me it was lacking on many levels.The movie starts well enough. The plot is there, but they spent far too much time on the birthing scenes and seem to draw it out just for the second part. Bloody, gory, and focused far too much attention on the pregnancy. This movie needed a lot more balance.If you have a weak stomach, do not eat before seeing this movie. We were shocked to actually see people protesting this movie outside saying we were all going to hell for watching it.This movie could have been excellent. If you take away most of the pregnancy and added a touch more to the rest of the movie, it would have been better.This is not one I would recommend to others. It left many in the theater even on the 2 d feeling a little off kilter on the stomachs.This is not one to bring small children to see. It was by far the darkest of the series and by far the weakest and bloodiest. I would struggle to recommend this for the teenage audience on the bloody pregnancy scenes. We loved the first ones of the series but this one was a disappointment. I hope they learn from their mistakes in the second part.Fiancée 8/10 stars me: 3 at best.",6,1,6,20 January 2012
The Hunger Games," Possibly the movie of the year
","We went to see this earlier today. I did not know much on the movie or the books, but I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw.The movie begins in District 12, showing the choosing of a boy and a girl to participate in the games. The main starlet, Katniss volunteers to compete after her sister is chosen in the raffle. It becomes clear she is both an accomplished huntress and has the survival skills to boot.People will put down this film on the killing of children as part of the games. Let me make this clear. The movie blurred out the killing sequences save one, when Rhu takes a spear in the chest, and she dies in Katniss' arms as she is sung to sleep. This movie is no worse than the battle scenes from Harry potter and the Twilight series. If parents let their children see harry potter and Twilight, this movie should be safe for them.As for action suspense and drama, The movie was intense, beautifully done, action packed. A secret crush becomes the driving force for survival. There were many tears shed in parts when the young girl died in Katniss' arms, a few screams from a surprise dog/hyena mix (not sure what it was).... Beyond that, if you can get past the purposefully blurred gory scenes, this movie is everything the hype predicted it would be. Action packed and all in all very entertaining.This film is a must see for the cult action teens who love twilight and harry potter. Safe for all audiences as well (there were many children under age 13 who were perfectly fine in the movie). Like I said if you survived harry potter and Twilight, this movie is mild on violence.Definitely a front runner for movie of the year. Top 5 for sure.",10,4,20,23 March 2012
Underworld Awakening," Good movie for what they show
","Ever been in one of those restaurants that offers a big meal but instead of a 16 ounce steak, you get the 8 ounce instead, leaving you hungry for more? Underworld is great for what they show. During the ride home, we were left scratching our heads at so much of the plot details that were missing. For a feature film, this one was barely 90 minutes, which was a shock. We did not see the 3D version, but what we saw it seemed rushed and incomplete. The move starts abruptly, goes right into the middle, and the ending is about as brief as the beginning.There is a plot, but it seems lost in the action, which this film has plenty of. The lab scenes look something out of the resident evil leftovers.It almost looks like they ran out of money, rushed the production, and left it without the normal plot development and story line we have grown to love.Selene and Eve both are hot, and for India Eisley, She puts on the performance of her life. As for Michael, If you were looking for the hot hybrid love of Selene's life, People will be very disappointed. Not only is he not listed in the credits shown here, but if you call 2 minutes maximum a performance, it was lacking. As Selene said, 'where's Michael?'Besides the lack of a opening and a close, the middle of the movie is well done. Just look at this as a light dinner, rather than the full course meal and hope they bring more next time. If the movie had the great opener and close we have come to expect, this film may have been the best of the series.",7,7,15,20 January 2012
