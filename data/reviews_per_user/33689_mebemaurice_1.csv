The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," God warned me... but I refused to listen
","SPOILERS BELOW!!!! PLEASE BE AWAREPuh-lease. As I am writing this review, I'm crying; not because of the 'epic' story lines etc, but because I've wasted 2 hours of my life.So, the film was released around November and I kept wanting to see it but something kept telling me: Don't!! Don't!!.. so I was like okay that must be god and he probably wants me to wait until its out on BLU-RAY.Today, I was watching Friends With Benefits online and it froze so I chose to just watch breaking dawn. First 3 minutes were so exciting to watch... I was so ready - knowing that I was kind of a Twilight fan from the previous ones. This one is a huge let down... seriously. If you want to pull a prank on your friend and bore him to death, make him watch this movie!!Please, I beg you... don't watch this rubbish!! You are going to regret it. I've never seen so much bad acting. THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY MAKES 'BEASTLY' LOOK LIKE IT'S WORTH AN Oscar, A GOLDEN GLOBE AND ANYTHING ELSE. THE WORST FILM I HAVE HAD TO SIT THROUGH...'Part 2, later this year'.... Part 2 my butt! I ain't watching it. This one doesn't deserve a part 2. Bella always looks like she forgot her lines and... ugh!! just so dumb... everything feels rushed... even though the film is like 2 hours... I don't know it lacks so much detail.PLEASE!!!! I PROMISE YOU!!! DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID!!! .... AND LISTEN TO GOD WHENEVER YOU GET A SIGN! P.S I don't know how ANYONE IN THE WORLD could say this was the best movie ever.. I pity them.",1,6,7,26 January 2012
