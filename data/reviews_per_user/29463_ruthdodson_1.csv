Blade Runner 2049," Wish it had not been made, such a disappointment
","Was very much looking forward to seeing this, having loved the original back in the day and recently revisited and not disappointed. However BR2049 bears no relation to the original. A very convoluted and uninteresting story arch, which did not maintain interest; the dystopian vision created originally was not recreated, nor advanced. If Philip K Dick had seen this, I'm not sure he would be impressed. Maybe we are just so used to CGI now, whereas in 1982 it was original. Cannot fault performances, although as talented he may be, there are only so many times you can tolerate seeing a close-up of a bloodied and troubled Ryan Gosling. The return of Harrison Ford as Deckard was welcome but as referenced all too brief and not sufficiently nuanced. As I say, wish it had not been made as does not do justice to the original, a very poor imitation, even down to the faux Vangelis soundtrack. Sorry.",1,17,33,21 October 2017
