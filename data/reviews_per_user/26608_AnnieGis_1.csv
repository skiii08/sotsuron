Walk the Line," Fantastic!
","I saw this movie last night, and I've done nothing but talk about the movie and listen to Johnny's music ever since.Without a doubt, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon will be nominated for Oscars for their roles in this movie. Joaquin was just electrifying, and Reese, as the hard-headed but loving June, was simply wonderful. The music was outstanding. I'm glad Joaquin and Reese performed the songs, because I would hate to know that I'd missed hearing what wonderful voices they have. (I was especially happily surprised by Reese's voice. It's gorgeous.) I've read recent reports that the family of Vivian Cash (Johnny's first wife) was upset by how their mother was depicted in the movie, but I don't really understand that. Ginnifer Goodwin, another one who deserves an Oscar nomination, showed Vivian's grief of being alone, raising her daughters alone, and knowing in her heart that her husband was in love with June. According to the movie, Johnny was a horrible husband to Vivian, and I thought the movie did a good job of not sugar-coating that fact. I admit I cheered a little when she smashed the picture of June because you couldn't really blame her for doing that.The supporting characters were also wonderful. It was so nice to see Shooter Jennings playing the role of his father, Waylon. Another Waylon, Waylon Payne, played Jerry Lee Lewis with wide-eyed craziness. I thought Shelby Lynne, who is well-known in the country music industry, was wonderful as Johnny's mother.I didn't know a lot about Johnny's early years with Sun Records, so it was great to see that on screen. I also didn't know that June finally accepted John's proposal while they were on stage singing 'Jackson.' (I'm assuming that was true and not just movie magic.) This movie, and John and June's love story, was magical. I don't find it surprising that John died four months after June passed. It was obvious that she was the love of his life.",10,18,28,25 November 2005
