Skyfall," Very Disappointing
","I'll will keep this short for fear of repeating what others have already said.My wife and I are huge Bond films fans and particularly enjoyed QoS and CR....however, Skyfall was a massive disappointment as a 'Bond' film.The plot was weak (where did the 'Agent list' go???) and the desire to show the weaknesses of Bond just has no standing in the Bond tradition, and frankly adds no value! To see James Bond CRYING at the end is just ridiculous! What utter utter nonsense! Why people are waxing lyrical over this film is beyond my reasoning...I give it 5....and that at a push... Oh and the 'Home Alone' scene at the end.....really ?????? Can only hope the next film gets back to the tradition and heritage that is Bond.",5,31,63,4 November 2012
La La Land," This really isn't a good film and does not deserve the hype....
","So....we went to see this film as a family today. What a disappointment !!! Where did all the hype come from for this film ? The actors are decent but are not great at singing or dancing which is a major issue for this type of production!The story is threadbare....the characters are frankly dull....what IS there to like ? So as a family.....we thought it was poor entertainment.....the people who left the cinema part way through, never to return....presumably thought it poor also... We spoke to friends afterwards who have also been to see it....thought it was rubbish also.....there is a theme here folks!!!!So we read up about the film after and read there is a backlash....as frankly the film doesn't deserve the hype.... Which frankly begs the question where all the hype has come from? So the film is released just before the Oscars....the 'critics' rave....the public is TOLD you must love this film! People vote positively....or are they genuine reviews.....and don't get me started on the critics....I'm sorry but people have had the wool pulled over their eyes.....this isn't worth the time or money to see....",3,7,11,26 February 2017
Prometheus," Weak story lines and character development...
","Well this was an interesting film...for the wrong reasons ! My wife and myself watched this film recently and though it promised much but the lack of understanding of the storyline and plot holes really made this a missed opportunity.All too often we were confused by the vagueness of the storyline....which would have been great if it was due to a clever script that purposely kept you guessing so as to deliver a glorious conclusion towards the end. However, this was just not the case and pure frustration ensued.Ironically, as we discussed the film we talked of lazy script writing which assumes that keeping people guessing and confused is a 'good thing' when in reality it hides the fact that there is no substance. An excellent writer will keep you guessing before delivering understanding and a conclusion in a glorious climax.Indeed the irony was that as we discussed the poor script we likened it to 'Lost' and low and behold two days later we realised that the writer was indeed from 'Lost' !!! This could have been and should have been an excellent film, but the opportunity was 'Lost'.....",5,1,2,30 January 2013
