Hereditary," Holy hell this movie is scary
",From reading many of the other reviews it seems that people will either love or hate this movie. Personally I think it is darn near close to a horror masterpiece. It is slow to start but once it gets going it's so good. It plays on emotions very well and the creepiness factor is on point. I was so uncomfortable watching (in the best way). It has a few jump scares as well and normally I don't fall for but these ones scared the bejesus out of me. Some take issue with the ending but it reminded me of Rosemary's baby which is one of my all time faves.,9,0,2,18 January 2019
