","The Devil's AdvocateThe cool thing about the Devil being your lawyer is that: depending on your body count, he may just work pro bono.Fortunately, the defense lawyer in this horror movie is not Satanhis boss is.While defending an accused pedophile, small-town attorney Kevin (Keanu Reeves) is approached by the prestigious law firm Milton, Chadwick and Waters.Accepting their generous offer, Kevin and his wife (Charlize Theron) move to Manhattan, where he shines in the courtroom, but not on the home front.With his marriage strained, his firm under investigation and lawyers turning up dead, Kevin approaches one of the partners, John Milton (Al Pacino), who reveals to him the demonic nature of the company and his part in it.A courtroom drama and supernatural thriller hybrid, The Devil's Advocate does an adequate job of representing both genres.However, everyone knows that the real Devil in the courtroom is the stenographer.

","The King's SpeechOh, great, a British king is about to speak – now I'm going to need a Cockney slang to lucid English dictionary.And while the articulating monarch in this drama ain't 'aving a giraffe, his North and South is all out of sorts.Following a public decree, where he stumbled over his words, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), on the behest of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks the aid of an experimental speech therapist, Lionel (Geoffrey Rush), in an attempt to alleviate his speech impediment.Apprehensive with the unorthodox treatment at first, when he ascends to the throne of England, Albert finds remedy in his friend's madness, as well as a secret past.Though a superlative cast graces it, this recounting of actual events is nothing but a pretentious factoid prolonged into a humdrum historical recollection.And while a stuttering king is startling, it's not as shocking as a lisping queen.

What's more, every guy has used the 'possessed by a cross-dressing ghost' excuse when they're caught. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",5,0,0,31 December 2013

","MoneyballThe sex/baseball analogy doesn't end with bases and home-runs.In fact, both activities also employ stats, performance-enhancing drugs and the capacity to bore women easily.Regrettably, this drama has nary a female to corroborate with that last comparison.When 3 of his star players jump ship, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), is left with a void to fill.Unable to attract any of the high paid players, Beane, instead, hires a young economist (Jonah Hill) to identify the sport's most undervalued players so that he can add them to his roster.While the unorthodox strategy attracts the ire of the A's manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman), all suspicions are quelled once the theory comes to fruition.Though it's a savvy deconstruction of baseball's financial divide, this true story can at times become tedious.Besides, blue-collar baseball fans will always prefer to drunkenly harassing rich athletes.

When he learns of a replicate that reproduced, K's superior (Robin Wright) orders him to kill the offspring before the manufacturer (Jared Leto) can exploit the glitch. K's search for the lost lovechild finds him face-to-face with the Blade Runner who held his position previously, Deckard (Harrison Ford). A visual feast with absorbing concepts but measured pacing and a taxing runtime, this long awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 adaptation of Philip K.

","​ Million Dollar Arm It makes sense that Hindi-speaking athletes would gravitate towards baseball since there's a team called the Indians. Racial epithets aside this sports-drama does involve players from India.When down-and-out sports agent J. B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) vacillates between a televised cricket match and a singing competition, he formulates a plan to invigorate his firm with talent from India.Convinced he'll find the next great baseball pitcher through a reality TV show format, J.B. enlists a cantankerous scout (Alan Arkin) to be a judge in the competition.Eventually, J.B. discovers two worthy candidates (Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal) and ships them back to America to try out for the majors.Based on a true story, Million Dollar Arm is a boilerplate feel-good Disney sports movie that concludes as expected, with no complexity or ingenuity required.On a related note, females traveling to India alone should always bring a baseball bat with them.

Along with Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll), Neil trains his body for the suicide mission. Meanwhile his wife (Claire Foy) worries about her husband's coldhearted approach to never seeing his family again.Beautifully shot with a haunting score and stoic acting from Gosling, this meditation on the first man on the moon may be a fine character study of the no-nonsense astronaut but it is also a very slow moving one at that.Incidentally, Vladimir Putin wants to put the first women on the moon by imprisoning Pussy Riot there.

","The Rise of the Planet of the ApesIf Earth is going to be an ape planet someday, at least we can look forward to the eradication of head lice.And while public grooming is still far-off, this sci-fi film does lay the groundwork for its mass acceptance.Born of a lab chimp filled with an experimental brain enhancement drug, Caesar (Andy Serkis) is naturally gifted.But when the hyper-intelligent orphan is scheduled for termination, the scientist (James Franco) who created the drug absconds with Caesar and rears him himself.Eventually, Caesar attacks a neighbour and is sent to an ape refuge, where his torment at the hands of a guard drives him to lead a primate uprising through San Francisco.A re-imagining of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Rise elevates the series to a new level via smart storytelling, sophisticated special effects and a seditious spirit.Besides, rampaging apes smell much better than Occupy protesters.

But when he catches his girl (Brittany Murphy) cheating, B-Rabbit gets the confidence to compete in a battle royal arranged by a gangbanger (Anthony Mackie).With a surprising performance from Eminem in a role that parallels his own upbringing, 8 Mile's gritty realism and follow-your-dreams mentality doesn't come off as clichÃ©d as with most urban productions.Furthermore, it's not your pigment that makes you a decent rapper; it's your level of misogyny.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7,0,1,14 January 2016

To teach the mortals a lesson, Hades informs the King of Argos that his daughter Andromeda will be sacrificed to the Kraken in 10 days. Desperate to save her, the King recruits an imprisoned demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) to seek the counsel of the Stygian Witches. Informed by the hags that the only way to kill the Kraken is with the head of the Gorgon, the unproven protagonist must put his wits to the test.A remake of the 1981 classic, this unwarranted overhaul fails to live up to its predecessor thanks to an wooden lead, clumsy creature designs and a schizophrenic script that's either too graphic or too goofy.Furthermore, with Zeus' history of seducing unsuspecting women, female viewers should probably take a pregnancy test after watching this.

","LimitlessUntil now, the only magic pill that a writer could take to gain fame and fortune was a sleeping pill...and plenty of 'em.Fortunately, the scribe in this thriller has discovered medication that can augment his intelligence without decreasing his existence.Already suffering writer's block, Eddie's (Bradley Cooper) despair doubles when his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish) dumps him.His luck turns, however, when his ex-brother-in-law introduces him to an experimental drug that can boost brain function.Blessed with brilliance, but addled by addiction, Eddie finds himself in bed with a Russian gangster and a Wall Street wizard (Robert DeNiro). With his stash depleting, and withdrawal not an option, Eddie must use his remaining high to mastermind a plan.With a capable cast, sweeping cinematography and stimulating script, Limitless is a slick, cerebral supposition.However, if humans really could use 100% of their brains than reality TV ratings would be in trouble.

","Don't BreatheThe most dangerous aspect of a blind person's house is their chaotically arranged furniture.Which is why the burglars in this thriller shouldn't walk around in the dark.Hard up for cash after a deal goes south, Detroit hoods Rocky (Jane Levy), Money (Daniel Zovatto) and Alex (Dylan Minnette) decide to break into the residence of a blind vet (Stephen Lang) who has a large legal settlement stowed away inside.However, the home invasion turns into murder when the sightless occupant begins offing the intruders to keep them from discovering what he has confined in his basement.Enriched by a number of narrative twists, Don't Breathe does a decent job of keeping up the tension and delivering the thrills. While some scenes can be construed as comical, the end result is a satisfying nail-biter.Incidentally, blind people think that someone is in their house every time the TV is on.

Overtime, the CIA asks Barry to start delivering firearms to the contras for Uncle Sam. Later, he's tasked with flying those same guerillas into the US for military training to help them oust their country's socialist government.A darkly comedic adaptation of the actual underhanded events that transpired during America's anticommunist efforts to destabilize Central America, Cruise's charm, director Doug Liman's stylish direction and the unbelievable script help deliver this enjoyable freight intact.Moreover, the best method for smuggling in drugs is inside of a detection dog.

","Murder on the Orient ExpressMost train slayings occur when tramps board a boxcar filled with drunk hobos.However, the choo choo in this mystery is too ritzy for silly rail yard homicides.While returning to London aboard the famed Orient Express, the equally eminent Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) is propositioned by a fellow passenger (Johnny Depp) looking to hire the detective to protect him for the duration of their journey.It's not until the man turns up dead does Poirot grasp the seriousness of his offer. Intrigue, as always, he gathers the other passengers/suspects (Willem Dafoe, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, PenÃ©lope Cruz, Daisy Ridley) and interrogates them.In the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's whodunit, Branagh manages to pull off her meticulous sleuth, but stumbles as the film's director. While the reveal is still a classic, the real crime is the underutilized supporting cast.Sadly, most killers in train related deaths are distracted engineers.

Sherlock Holmes," The Vidiot Reviews...
","Sherlock HolmesIn this day and age, the only prerequisites needed to be a police detective is a badge, a gun, an ulcer, a bitch of an ex-wife, and one helluva drinking problem. In 1891, however, detectives, like the one featured in this mystery, needed to be astute, refined and have one helluva cocaine addiction.After foiling Lord Blackwell's human sacrifice, detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his assistant Dr. Watson (Jude Law) descend further into the quagmire of black magic when the recently executed Blackwell rises from the grave. What's more, Holmes must contend with the return of his ex-girlfriend (Rachel McAdams), a master thief in the service of a shadowy mastermind.Directed by Guy Ritchie, Sherlock Holmes is a rollicking revision of the scholarly sleuth which uses kinetic camera work and cocky actors to coax out the characters lesser-known qualities. Hip and contemporary, with a solid footing in Arthur Conan Doyle lore, Sherlock Holmes will please both newcomers and diehards alike.And while they may seem like they are more than just friends, I assure you, the partnership between Holmes and Watson is as innocent as that of Batman and Robin's, R2-D2 and C3PO's, or Siegfried and Roy's.

But while attempting to ditch him the pair become embroiled in a string of altercations involving Animal Control, a gang of unwanted pets and a plot to wipe out humanity implemented by a tyrannical rabbit (Kevin Hart).Lacking the laughs and emotional oomph of the more prominent cartoon creations, this 3-D computer animated Indy tries to emulate all of the big studio earmarks - celebrity voices, maudlin moments and pop music medleys – but fails to reach any real consistency that makes you care about these critters.

","Madagascar 3: Europe's Most WantedThe thing about Europe's Most Wanted is most often the wanted is a Canadian fleeing dismemberment charges back home.However, in the case of this animated movie, the hunted are all Americans.Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) flee Madagascar for their home in NYC.Stopping in Monte Carlo to pick up their penguin pals' plane, the zoo crew attracts an Animal Control officer (Frances McDormand) determined to mount Alex's pride.But when their plane doesn't pan out, Alex and the gang must join a traveling circus disguised as Big Top performers.While the cast has grown long in the fang, the injection of new characters, garish colours and foreign venues has revitalizes this waning series.Incidentally, between a zoo and a circus, these exotic creatures would suffer less abuse hiding in an abattoir.

","Inside Llewyn DavisThe key to being a successful folk singer is finding the perfect street corner to busk on.Even more prominent, the troubadour in this drama has found himself a coffee house to play at.After his partner's suicide, couch surfing, folk singer Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) learns a fellow folk singer (Carey Mulligan) is pregnant with his baby.Llewyn agrees to pay for the abortion and that arrangement sets the stage for his journey from Greenwich to Chicago to see a record producer (F. Murray Abraham) in hopes of establishing a solo career.A striking recreation of the 1960s café scene, directors Joel and Ethan Coen bring their oddball blend of dark humour, eccentric characters and esoteric metaphors to the format.And while not every message is comprehensible and not every ballad is enjoyable, the artistry is undeniable.Incidentally, the folk singer movement ended the very day Bob Dylan became indecipherable.Yellow Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",6,0,0,13 March 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," The Vidiot Reviews...
","The Cabin in the WoodsWhen spending time at a cabin in the woods it's important to remember the essentials: beers, babes and bone cutters.Unfortunately, the co-eds in this horror-comedy only brought 2 of the 3 basics with them, so there'll be plenty of gangrene.Dana (Kristen Connolly) and her friends (Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams) decide to stay at a shack in the sticks owned by a distant relative.After settling in, the group uncovers a stash of scripture in the cellar that, when read aloud, brings the dead to life.While carnage ensues above, beneath the cottage is a clandestine control centre, where loquacious technicians (Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford) manipulate the group's emotions.An abnormal fabrication of screams and laughs, Cabin in the Woods infuses sci-fi with the slasher genre and toys with its archetypes.However, the scariest thing about a cabin in the woods remains: no Internet.

","SpectreWith his parentless upbringing, eccentric enemies and endless gadgets, it's obvious that James Bond is really Batman.And while Gotham City is not on Bond's itinerary in this action movie, he does travel extensively.While Agent 007 (Daniel Craig) goes about exposing a clandestine criminal empire run by a ghost from his past, Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), his boss M (Ralph Fiennes) tries to keep MI5 from shutting down the Double O program in favor of a worldwide intelligence gathering initiative.With help from a Quantum scientist's daughter (Léa Seydoux), Bond ascertains that the two may just be connected.The 24th installment in the British spy franchise, Spectre certainly serves up some ambitious action sequences and unexpected surprises. However, those revelations are more inane than intriguing, while the main villain is just feeble in general.Moreover, doesn't Spectre realize that the only way to thwart James Bond is with an STI?

Joy," The Vidiot Reviews....
","JoyThe Home Shopping Network works exactly like online shopping, except quantities are limited and time is running out.Two things the aspiring inventor in this dramedy knows all too well. Determined to bring her removable mop-head to market, single mother Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) convinces a QVC bigwig (Bradley Cooper) to allow her the rare opportunity to host her own segment, which eventually brings in sales.But a shifty manufacturer recommended by her deadbeat dad's (Robert De Niro) girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) could put an end to all of her success, her supply and her patent.Based on the semi-motivational true story, Joy's ensemble cast and offbeat direction offers the only entertainment in this breezy biography. Whereas the plodding script only services those high- points as it lurches towards its inspiring yet manipulated ending.Maybe next time they could focus on a real QVC superstar, like, the inventor of porcelain clown figurines.

The Nice Guys," The Vidiot Reviews...
","The Nice GuysIf it weren't for bad fathers there wouldn't be any porn stars in the world today.Thankfully, there are no shortages of either in this buddy-comedy.When an adult film actress (Margaret Qualley) disappears, a gruff enforcer (Russell Crowe) is forced to work with a PI (Ryan Gosling) and his daughter (Angourie Rice) in order to find her - and to dissuade a dangerous third-party.But when her latest project turns out to be an X-rated expose on the car industry's exhaust inhibitor cover-up, the motley detectives find themselves searching for her misplaced stag film at the 1977 L.A. Auto Show.With all of the sleaze of 1970s pulp cinema and the witty banter and odd couple camaraderie of classic comedic duos, Gosling and Crowe forge a unique bromance through a sharp script and apt directing.Furthermore, porn shoots make the best crime scenes on account they're covered in DNA evidence.

Mad Max: Fury Road," The Vidiot Reviews....
","Mad Max: Fury RoadThe ironic thing about teenage girls embracing the idea of a post- apocalyptic world is that, in one, they would all be sex-slaves.An outcome the anti-heroes in this action movie would like to preclude.When Furiosa (Charlize Theron) flees from his fortress with five of his breeding wives, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his foot soldiers follow them into the nuclear wasteland to reclaim his unborn offspring.Partaking in the pursuit is a dutiful lackey (Nicholas Hoult) driving a death-mobile outfitted with a prisoner Max (Tom Hardy), who later goes on to help Furiosa and her cargo reach the fabled Green Place.A non-stop car-chase with explicit violence and nightmarish monster trucks, set against an arid color-saturated landscape, this fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise is an accessible, over-the-top, visceral experience with unexpected environmental and feminist undertones.Incidentally, driving recklessly at high speeds is only acceptable on long-weekends.

Hacksaw Ridge," The Vidiot Reviews...
","Hacksaw RidgeBy not arming your troops you cut your military budget, like, in half. In fact, the unarmed soldier in this drama supports that economical theory.Following Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) is determined to join the war effort, but his Seventh-day Adventist beliefs preclude him from carrying a firearm or from fighting on Saturdays.Scorned by his superiors (Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington) and platoon over his convictions, Desmond's medical training later mends those who ridiculed him during the Battle of Okinawa, where he singlehandedly transports the injured back to base. Based on real events, but more importantly a real pacifist, this unconventional Mel Gibson helmed war-story is steeped in heroism and Catholicism. While it is an unflinching depiction of battlefield horrors, Gibson's overly graphic skirmishes seem to indulge in the violence, especially when directed at the Imperialists.Moreover, being unarmed indicates to your enemy that you're an omnipotent being.

Warcraft," The Vidiot Reviews...
","WarcraftSurprisingly, the worst villain in World of Warcraft is your spouse's divorce lawyer.Luckily, that bloodsucking shyster is nowhere near this fantasy/adventure.When an ancient magic reappears in the realm of Azeroth, the king (Dominic Cooper) sends a knight (Travis Fimmel), a wizard (Ben Foster) and his apprentice (Ben Schnetzer) on a campaign to uncover its origin.They eventually ascertain that the leader of a rogue band of orcs (Clancy Brown) is using sorcery to sustain a portal capable of bringing his horde to their world.With help from a half-human orc (Paula Patton) the trio hopes to disengage the doorway in time.Based on the popular online game, this poorly animated live-action adaptation is largely a fan-centric experience. Hindered by half-ass acting and way too much exposition, Warcraft is too convoluted for noobs.Incidentally, the best way to defeat orcs is to use J. R. R. Tolkien's estate lawyers.

The Runaways," The Vidiot Reviews...
","The RunawaysIf you ask me, The Runaways sound like the kind of band that one would go see with a pimp who is looking to replenish his underage prostitute coffers.And while the members of this rock n' rebellious girl group aren't hookers, they do have to swallow plenty of cockamamie ideas in order to succeed in the male dominated music industry.Formed by eccentric record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) in 1975, The Runaways are comprised of 5, 16-year-old female musicians clad in leather and lace. With the precocious Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) on vocals and the ill-reputed Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) on rhythm guitar, the group garners a huge fan base. Unfortunately, the road takes its toll on the inexperienced girls and they lose themselves to drugs, drink and ego, ultimately tearing the band apart.Based on Curry's memoir, The Runaways is a satisfactory biopic of a band that spawned more successful solo careers than 1# songs, however, while it has its merits, i.e. visceral visuals and sleazy soundtrack, it's just not that tragic of a band biography.Besides, everyone knows the most shocking disintegration of any musical collaboration is, and always will be, the breakup of a one-man-band.

Me Before You," The Vidiot Reviews...
","Me Before You They're called wheelchair ramps but you rarely see people doing jumps off them.Hopefully, the paralyzed person in this romance gives it ago after their melancholy.Years after a road accident left him wheelchair-bound, ex-financier Will (Sam Claflin) continues to suffer from depression over the loss of his former lifestyle.Lou (Emilia Clarke) is an unemployed waitress who agrees to become the primary caregiver to the posh playboy.Although her pep and his self-pity don't mix, when she learns of his suicide pact, she plans to dissuade him by showing him the beauty of life with or without mobility.While the leads have enough chemistry to pull of the love/hate angle of this adaptation of the British bestseller, it comes off as craven and insensitive when faced with the touchy issue of euthanasia. Nonetheless, it's still hard to tell if someone's dating a handicapped person just for the parking privileges. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",5,0,3,14 August 2016

","ContactThe scariest thing about meeting aliens is that they could have bigger guns than us.Smartly, the aliens in this sci-fi film are transporting a single humanoid to them.Subsidized by an enigmatic billionaire (John Hurt) after her boss (Tom Skerritt) cuts her government funding, Dr. Arroway (Jodie Foster) is allowed to continue her research into extraterrestrials, which proves fruitful when a coded message arrives from space.Once deciphered, the data details how to construct a device capable of transporting a passenger across the universe. When word gets out, religious zealots successfully stop the first attempt. But another launch with Dr. Arroway aboard is successful. While the reveal of the aliens in this adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel is anticlimactic, the philosophical preamble to the final interaction is so engrossing the unorthodox ending is forgivable, even commendable.Besides, real aliens would most likely be microscopic organismsattached to gigantic cephalopods.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",8,0,0,15 February 2017

","Transformers: Dark of the MoonFor humans, 'dark of the moon' refers to the anus area of the person mooning.For the transmogrifying space-creatures in this sci-fi movie, however, it means the enslavement of humanity.When Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) learns that a ship from his home world is marooned on the moon, he helms a mission to retrieve its sole occupant, his mentor: Sentinel Prime (Leonard Nimoy).Unfortunately, Megatron (Hugo Weaving) and the Decepticons arrived at the wreckage years earlier and claimed the cargo – pillars to connect a spacebridge between Earth and Cybertron.Hoping to prevent its assembly is Optimus' human friend Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and his new squeeze (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley).While it's the best of the trilogy, Dark of the Moon is still a 3-hour muddle of mechanical components clanging out a cacophonous din of dumbness.Besides, there are more important things that could've been recovered from the moon, like Buzz Aldrin's wallet.
