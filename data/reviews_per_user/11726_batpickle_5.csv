Walk the Line," Not great acting but great impersonations!
","I liked the movie but like so many it is more impersonating than acting. I thought the same thing of 'Ray' last year, except walk the line does a better job than 'Ray'. The story line is good and gives you enough background in the life of Johnny Cash and the type of person he was. I was pleased to see that it didn't glorify him and showed the faults in his personality and moral character. It did not give a whole lot of info of the life of June Carter. The story doesn't really tell you anything that you didn't already know about Johnny Cash unless maybe you just weren't ever interested in his life before hand. Big Johnny Cash fans might not find it all that compelling but probably will see it, people who don't like Johnny Cash have no reason to see it. Overall I liked the movie and would recommend renting it but I wouldn't buy the DVD until it goes in the $5.00 bin!",7,0,1,1 March 2006
Hostel," HOSTEL .... A brilliant movie and very well done and creepy!
","Boy I liked this movie a bunch!!!!!!!! This is an excellent visual experience very well acted and as shocking as you could want from a movie!! This movie will make you think twice about backpacking abroad! With the set design and filming locations you really got the feel of being there, and let me tell you it's not a place you would want to be! I can't think of one thing that I did not like about this movie and i throughly enjoyed my movie going experience! I am not getting into any detail of the movie because I think the less you know going in the more moved by this film you will be! If you are a fan of this genre than this is the movie for you...don't miss it at the theater...buy it when it comes out on DVD and share it with everyone old enough to see it!! You all will love it!!",10,1,3,2 March 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Hills Remake......Not as visceral as everyone is saying!!!
","First of all lets start out with all these people who are writing comments and people writing reviews about how GORY and Visceral this movie is! Well it's not that gory, so apparently these people did not see Hostel which I thought was a far more gut wrenching and visually scary film. This film had it's moments but if you have seen the original it kind of takes away from this movie. I left the theater feeling a little uninspired. I know I know it's a remake but the plot followed so closely that it seemed to take away the shock value of the special gore effects. The gore was good when it was there but still was not what I was expecting. Out of the 3 recent horror movies that I have seen at the theater I would have to rank them: 1. Hostel 2. Final destination 3 3. Hills have eyes as far as the gore factor, don't get me wrong the acting and story line in this movie is far superior to FD3 but FD3 had more astounding kill scenes! Overall you won't be disappointed with Aja's effort here but it is lacking something.",7,0,0,27 March 2006
The Princess Bride," It brought a smile to my face....WHEN THE CREDITS BEGAN TO ROLL!!!
","I had never seen this movie and a co-worker brought it over to watch one night and said ' I think you will like this, it's very funny!' Honestly, I never came close to smiling watching this pungent pile of bile let alone laugh at it. My god people how does this rank in the IMDb Top 250 of all time? Can anyone explain to me anything about this movie that is mildly amusing, Wallace Shawn is so annoying, the dialog is replete with stinkyocity and the story is so simplistic a baby would be bored! Now there is nothing offensive about the movie but I will bet you my kids would hate this but I may never know because I can't bare sitting through it again. As I read through some other user comments I felt compelled to write this because it is a minority opinion but dang! PLEASE SOMEONE EXPLAIN YOUR LOVE OF THIS PIECE OF ROB REINER GARBAGE! By the way I love most all of Mr. Reiners other movies!",1,33,96,18 June 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Low speed fender bender in a parking lot...
","Well I just watched this with three friends and the feeling is wow! What a complete waste of time! Not one person liked it and this 2 hour snore fest produces only a couple laughs at best! Seriously, this movie is a bunch a Saturday Night Live skits that all run to long way past the point of when it could of been funny ( but most of them weren't) to the point where you are almost tempted to shut the movie off if the scene went on any longer. At points it tries so hard to come up with something funny that you actually feel sorry for the actors reading the dialog because it is just pathetic. I have seen a lot of Will Ferrels movies and I have liked most of them, not so in this case! Not good... Not funny... Not worth renting.... No spoilers here..nothing to spoil!",1,11,23,12 December 2006
