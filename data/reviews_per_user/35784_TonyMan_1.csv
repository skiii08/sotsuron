The Ring," Before you die, beg for a plot!
","Sorry, but this flic left me cold.  The first half had some good tension and a couple of quick scares.  Then it gets totally muddled. 
Spoiler alert!!!Why are theses killings happening?  What happened to this girl?  Why was her mother not supposed to have a child?  What did Dad know & do?  Where did the tape come from. And worst of all, why were the horses drowning?????  Loved near the end the frantic calls to the boyfriend & the constatly ringing telephone - guess he never heard of an answering machine.Sheesh, I saw this because a co-worker said it was scary & troubling. Biggest trouble is it doesn't make any sense!",1,2,7,29 October 2002
