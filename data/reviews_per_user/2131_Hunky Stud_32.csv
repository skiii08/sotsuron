United 93," It made me cry so many times.
","wow, this is a serious tear-jerking film. When I write comments, I usually don't like to admit that I cried while watching. I just watched the movie called 'Joyeux Noel' last night, it made cry. This one made me cry several times. I cried so hard when one woman talked to someone on the phone that she loved them.The story seems very authentic. They didn't waste any time on any unnecessary minor things. Even though this film is 111 minutes long, I don't think that it is long at all. At the last part, it only focused on what happened on that flight. Instead, they could have added a few more scenes from those control centers during or after the crash. I was afraid that this film might have too many brutal, violent scenes, such as blood flying everywhere, etc. It was not too bloody.While watching, I wondered if they would show the US president. If they use an actor, it could certainly ruin the moment, because he is not the real one. It didn't happen.One big problem for this film is its cinematography. That is the reason why I gave it to a 9 instead of a 10. Sometimes, it was obvious that the cameraperson was holding the camera by hand, so the scenes were shaking, or they focused on the subject too closely, or the camera was moving too fast as if someone was running from one place to another to give us the view. It made me feel dizzy. After all, this is a big screen film, not a home-made video. They want to give the audiences the feeling of being right there, they did not have to sacrifice the big screen images.It would be nice if they list all the names and occupations of all the people aboard on that plane, maybe even those important real people's names when they first appeared. After all, this is not a fiction, it really happened. They can do that in the next release. I was surprised that Ben Sliney was the actual FAA Director of Operations. He did a really good job, very real.I don't know anything about those four actors who portrayed the 'terrorists' on the plane, hopefully they didn't get any threatens from anyone after this film. They were as real as they can be.In the bonus feature, they only interviewed a few family members which are all Caucasian looking. I don't know if most of the family members had opportunities to meet with the person who acted as their beloved ones. Even though it was also touching, but it seemed to lack of diversity. It is a pity that neither of the pilot's family members were shown, one of the pilot was a black guy who just had a baby not so long ago. There were many other family members who were not included in it. Maybe those family members declined. Probably most of them have already been interviewed by various news medias which I just didn't have a chance to see them all.One interesting note, this film won 'Best British Film' by the Empire Awards, UK in 2007.",9,2,4,20 December 2007
Minority Report," Where are the minorities?
","when I watched the production documentary, especially when the computer animation department were doing their screen review, it seems that all the workers were Caucasians . Where are the 'intelligent' 'smart' Asian engineers, animators, etc? And if I remember it clearly, it seems that everyone who is in charge of those individual departments are Caucasians. Are Asian Americans not capable of managing any of those departments? That made me to think further, how come there was not any major Asian actors in this movie? In the year of 2050, Washington DC seems to have only two races, whites and blacks. I don't want to accuse anyone being racist, however, it just doesn't seem to be right. After all, Hollywood is located right in Los Angeles, where Asian population is very big. They actually had meetings with all kinds of scientists talking about what kind of things, weapons people will use in 2050, how can the director, casting director forget to mention about the race issue in 2050? Ever since Jesse jackson protested during one Oscar event, we now constantly see black actors being nominated and won Oscar awards. Just because Asians do not protest, that does not mean that Hollywood movies should ignore the Asian race, especially for a movie that is set in the future when Asian population will be even bigger.Why are those three precogs all Caucasian, and the female actor was not even a US citizen. Are they willingly agreed to be put in the water tank for the rest of their lives? And if this thing goes national, where are they going to get other precogs for all other cities? And when they die, where are they going to find the new precogs? Overall, this is a entertaining movie to watch, but it has its logical flaws.",8,1,4,6 March 2007
The Maze Runner," finally, an Asian male actor was in a leading role!
","Asians have been living in the USA since 1800's, but there is very few Asian males in any leading roles in any of the Hollywood films. most of the time, they were hired for comical effects, or as gongfu fighters, etc. for that reason alone, i gave this film a 10. when the film first started, I thought that it was just another film about black and white people, I thought that the black actor will be the leader throughout the film. I was surprised that Lee Kihong (koreans are like Chinese, they put last name first.) was acting in most part of the film. although i have to say that the storyline may appear illogical in some areas, it is just very entertaining. I truly enjoyed it. It is rare that this film gave me an out of this world experience. i can't wait to see part two. Maybe someday someone will make a TV series for this film, who knows. It is kind of similar to the TV show - lost.",10,4,8,8 May 2015
12 Monkeys," you will be sucked in.
","This is a really intense movie. You will be sucked in, you want to keep watching until the end. this is definitely a good sci fi movie. I especially like this sort of time travel stories, very interesting.
It seems that there might a sequel since the end seems to be just a new beginning.",9,1,1,13 January 2003
The Girl Next Door," where are the Asians?
","I was not going to write a comment, but I was just thinking how come I didn't see any Asians in this film? I started to notice about this phenomena ever since I saw the film 'Minority report' which did not have any Asian actors in them.Have you ever seen an Asian male jock in any of the Hollywood high school or college movies? I don't think that there is one. There maybe some Asian girls as the popular students, but I have never seen any Asian males in any leading characters in any high school or college movies.That guy Sannang reminds me of the Asian character in 'Breakfast at Tifannys' which was very racially offensive to all Asians. Even though Sannang is supposed to be very smart, but look at him, he talks like an idiot, and he looks funny. The whole high school was laughing at him when his video was shown. The director chose to make him a 'smart' student, that did not reduce his true intent which is to make fun of this Asian in degrading ways. That is very wrong. If he chose an African student to make fun of, would the blacks tolerate such a thing? I don't think so. If he wants to make fun of Asians, at least he should have hired another Asian actor for a positive role. Asians should not be silent again, we should not just take it for granted that Asians should be invisible in Hollywood movies! In this film, all the jocks are white, the protagonist and his two friends are also white. The teachers are also white. The only Asian female actor was a porn star in this movie. The high school is supposed to be somewhere outside of Los Angeles. Asian students can be found in almost all California high schools, how can it be possible that in that particular high school, there was no Asian students? It doesn't make sense that those 'jocks' were willing to make a video with those porn stars. And when Kelly wants to have a private talk with Matthew at the end, where did the principal go? How did Matthew become the president of the student body if he is not even popular? How can Kelly get a whole bottle of Ectasy drug directly from the glove compartment, what if he the police stops him one day and search his car? And his parents were OK to let him to go out with that girl late at night even though they just met?",7,0,1,14 March 2007
Billy Elliot," 3 great stories in one movie.
","I really enjoyed this movie. I heard something great about it, but i didn't expect that it can be so good. I really like the tender moments between the two boys. And at the end, when billy kissed the other boy on his cheek, that is a very sweet moment. this movie basically has 3 stories. the main story is about Billy, the second is the strike at the mine. And the mini story is about Billy's friend who loves him. I was a little confused at the very beginning about the strike story. It did not explain well what was happening. However, I suppose that it maybe because I don't live in Britain, so I don't know their local events. I remembered seeing the movie 'full monty' in which was also about stories laid off workers who worked at mines. Unlike some of the movies in which you can always get the outcome, this film has quite a few unexpected twists in it. For example, when the teacher suggested Billy to go for an audition, one probably would expect that he would go to that audition and won admission instantly. then everyone will be happily ever after. it didn't happen that way. There is one little minor detail that i didn't like. At the end of the movie, it showed the Billy's dad and brother visiting the grown up him dancing. However, I felt that the grown up billy is a little bit too old. they should have picked a teenager. And his dad looked older, however, his brother looked the same. That is not very convincing.",9,0,0,15 August 2003
The Others," This is so unexpected, and well acted.
","It is a hard movie to make, because there are not lots of characters, and it all happened in the same place.Nicole Kidman did a great job of showing fear, catching my attention. and the end result is totally unexpected. Even though it has the essence of many previous films, such as the Sixth sense, this one is also different in the storyline and in the way it elicits fears in me.Unlike some other movies, this movie provides clues that you can only understand after the end of the movie. it was a suspense movie well done. I simply can't tell who is the ghost, and who is not.But I have to say that one time watching is enough for this film. Unlike some other big dramas, it probably lacks the emotional value that can lure you to watch it again.",8,0,1,25 April 2004
The Flowers of War," a little bit slow, but very touching.
","this is a film that makes me sad, i want to stop watching, because it is so depressing, but i can't stop watching, because it is a well-made film.Christian bale played in 'empire of sun' when he was younger in shanghai, now he was back playing in Nanjing. he probably felt like coming back home once again. he is a solid actor.it is a pity that such a good film didn't win an Oscar.on the other hand, this film is limited mostly in one single location. it could have spent a little time describing what happened in the capital of China during that period of time.This is also one of the first film which Nanjing dialect was used throughout, it is very rare. long live the Republic of China!",9,0,0,12 November 2013
Interstellar," weak storyline, this film is over-rated.
","i was expecting to see an exciting sci-fi film which will keep you watching till the end due to its high rating, but it was a disappointment. it has several problems in no particular order.1. the robot's design is too simple and ugly. it was basically a square with a computer screen in it. if people can send spaceship beyond the moon, shouldn't the robots have more functions? this ugly robot doesn't even have two hands. it can't really do anything other than talking. 2. the robot's voice sounds just like matt damon. i thought that they want to save money, so they just used the same actor. it made the film sounded cheap.3. cooper the character didn't do anything scientific, all of sudden, he was flying a spaceship into the deep space? that didn't make sense.4. lack of asians. in 2016, black people are protesting lack of 'diversity' in Oscar, this film didn't have any Asian faces in it. there are more Asian scientists than blacks . this film failed to hire Asian actors.",6,4,6,14 February 2016
"Monsters, Inc."," funny, but meaningless.
","I just saw the movie. it is funny, but it is very meaningless. You can guess the ending before it even ends. it is a good movie if you just want to relax and have some laugh. however, when it ends, you would even have anything to talk about.That is just my opinion.",6,2,6,5 April 2002
Man of Steel," henry cavil is the wrong guy for the superman.
","before i watched the film, i saw the superman pictures, i didn't think that he was the right for the film. I am not talking about his acting skills, only his look. now i have finally saw this film, i still don't think that he is the right superman.The teenage clark kent has the typical cute handsome superman look, but henry cavil doesn't fit with the typical superman image (clean cut, cute, youthful) at all, he looks like he is from the dark side. he could play the counter part of the superman, but not superman himself. his hair looks greasy, his looks like over 30 instead of mid-20's superman. most of the time, he looks like he is about to do something evil, instead of doing something good for the earth. wrong guy for this film, although this film itself is good entertainment. it has some new concepts for this age old icon film. and it has so many big special effects that go by so fast that you want to rewind and watch them again. Overall, I enjoyed watching it, but I hope that the next superman will be a new guy.",8,0,5,27 December 2013
21," i am shocked by this racist practice, not based on a true story!
","when I saw the film, I thought that it was just another average caucasian film, it has so many white characters in it which is so typical for most Hollywood films. the last memorable mostly Asian film that i saw was : Joy Luck Club, which was so long ago. often times, people say that Hollywood doesn't have many films that are suitable for Asian American actors, because most roles are for white people. there are hardly any Asian children in the USA that have dreams of becoming big actors, because they never see any famous big Asian actors as their role models. when i saw the film, i only knew that it was based on 'a true story'. i thought that it was some smart white students from mit who did it. I just found out that this film was actually based on some real Asian students from MIT. it could be a good positive film to represent Asian people in the USA. i am shocked that i was fooled by this so-called 'true story' which wasn't true at all. this film could be one of the few rare films that actually have plenty of roles for Asian American actors. the producers and director chose to discriminate against Asian American actors, did the wrong thing by hiring white actors. no matter how they explain it, what they did is totally racist. and the protagonist wasn't even a US citizen, he is a foreigner. why do Hollywood hire foreigners who have to fake US accent when there are plenty of Asian American actors who speak perfect English.black people boycotted 2016 Oscar because it has no black nominations. some Asian American actors might have won an Oscar if they were given the chance to play a role in this film.",1,2,6,14 April 2016
"I, Robot"," right on the future.
","The future, robots, and the unimaginable always fascinate me.This film is exciting to watch, and the logic is quite reasonable. However, the gadgets that they used in the film are not very futuristic. For example, they are still using cell phones, and office settings are still very much like the 20th century. Some of the city traffic scenes are well done. Nevertheless, we have seen plenty of those in many previous movies.I was a little disappointed that they actually used a real actor for the robot Sunny. Of course, this is still the year of 2004. I don't expect a real robot actor. They could have used a computer-generated robot through out the movie, and then it might be too expensive. In the ending, when they had to destroy the mainframe computer, it looks as if they just combined scenes from <<Star Wars>> and <<2001>>. Same concept, almost same scene.",9,0,0,10 September 2004
The White Ribbon," this film is over-rated.
","i heard about this film from the 'the secret in their eyes' board, because I thought that that film was over-rated. then a person wrote a response saying that she liked this film better. and i saw that this film has such a high rating, i was excited to watch it.i thought that it was a some sort of ghost story because the movie poster on here is in black and white, eerie looking. i thought that i may get scared of ghosts after i watch this film late at night. that is what usually happens after i watch a good ghost film. it wasn't that exciting to watch at all, i had to watch it in two nights. otherwise, i would lose interest.first of all, it is not necessary to film it in black and white, especially for such a long film. it would be more attractive if it was in color. it would make this film more watchable. and after all, this is not a ghost film or scary film.second, with all the incidents that happened, the ending didn't seem to be so shocking, because it wasn't confirmed by the police or anyone at all.it did keep me guessing who caused all of those incidents till the end.",6,2,5,12 December 2011
She's the Man," they picked the wrong girl.
","This girl still looks like a man after all the makeup! They picked the wrong girl. There are several movies and TV shows which girls had to act like guys, such as 'just one of the guys', 'young Americans' by WB. Those girls look believable.She still has her baby fat cheeks, it was just that obvious. Her brother still doesn't look like her with the wig on, anyone should be able to instantly tell that it is not the same guy during the football game. She should have just cut her hair instead of wearing a wig all the time.Time sure has changed, in 'just one of the guys', that girl actually showed her breasts in front of the camera, it still got a PG-13 rating. Ih this movie, they didn't show anything. Are they becoming more conservative now? They should have picked someone else for this role. Having said that, her acting skill is not bad, which compensated for her physical appearance.I especially like the scene when Duke, Olivia and Viola were together in the gym, Duke acted so well as if he was swooned by Olivia's presence, that was so memorable.This movie could be get a 9 from me, if they picked the right girl.",7,0,0,24 October 2008
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Time travel story, my favorite.
","I don't think that this is a film for little kids any more. It has gone beyond simple magic to some sophisticated logic comprehension. I think that this movie is the best among the three. It is no longer just about good versus evil. It actually has a twist, that made this whole movie so much more interesting and more enjoyable. I am especially interested in those films that have time travel, extra dimensions, etc. The director has done a good job describing the logic behind the time travel story, which could be confusing. And I did not get bored by watching the parallel story played out.I have never read any of the books. So I don't really know any of the magic names. There are quite a few new names that I can't understand. That is the only problem of this film. And I also had a little trouble understanding their English accent.",9,0,0,29 June 2004
Gone with the Wind," An epic that has gone with the wind.
","This is truly an epic that has gone with the wind.It was made in 1939. However, when I saw it today for the first time in 2002, it still catches my attention just like a modern movie does. It has a few jokes, and it also has many emotional moments that touch one's heart. That was an era that has long gone, yet the same tragic and happiness that we still encounter today.Vivien Leigh is an excellent actress, her fluent performance from her teenage years until her married years is just perfect. It is sad that beauty and youth can't stay forever, I wonder if she could be a bigger star had she lived in today. Gone are the good old days, an epic that I truly treasure.",10,2,3,9 May 2002
2012," This is an excellent movie, I loved it very much.
","I am surprised that at this moment, this film only got a 5.6 rating. I was going to rate it 8, but now I am rating it a 9.I loved it its intense special effects, and its intense sound effects. After all, that is what big disaster movies are all about.The storyline may not be very strong, but it is supposed to entertain us. And I was truly entertained for over two hours. This is a movie well done. There was a few dull moments, but overall, it is big.I watched it on DVD, I should have watched it in a big theater with a big screen. The special effects were purely amazing! One problem with this movie is its lack of Chinese people. After all, the ships were supposed to be built in China. There was no Chinese leaders or many Chinese people shown in the movie.",9,2,8,4 November 2010
Hero," An Epic with a weak storyline.
","This movie is quite different comparing with Director Zhang's other movies. This is a big leap forward than all his previous movies. This movie is totally picturesque. All the settings are surreal. Some of the scenes are quite touching. The music is also good.It also surprised me a little that this film has attracted so many audiences who probably don't know much about the ancient Chinese history. And the storyline is not very strong; it only has 4 major characters.The cinematography and the costumes are definitely impressive. Some good films can be watched over and over. For this one, one time viewing is good enough.",9,0,0,10 September 2004
Moulin Rouge!," A well done musical.
","The storyline is not complicated, however, this is a well done musical. It is unlike some of the musicals that I have seen which appear to be awkward when the characters try to sing. Those dialogues and songs are well integrated. The two main actors are exceptionally talented, they can really sing!
I love all those nice songs.",10,0,1,21 October 2001
Casualties of War," Only in the USA, the greatest country of all!
","Wow, I am really impressed by this movie. After all, unlike those typical war movies made from Hollywood, even though the government probably don't pay them any money, most of the war movies are trying to tell the whole world how great the US soldiers are. whatever the wars they are fighting for, it seems that they are always fighting for the right cause. And the US audiences generally like to pay money to watch that kind of movies.This movie is entirely the opposite, from what I watched from the DVD extras, not many studios were interested in financing for this movie. And it didn't make a lot of money, either. Michael J. Fox talked during the interview, at that time, a lot of people paid money to watch 'honey, I shrunk the kids', look at it now, who actually remember that movie.In those socialist countries (aka communist countries, known to the westerners), those governments always like to teach their students that in capitalist countries, greedy capitalists only goal is to make money. Only in socialist countries, can the real people make movies for all the working classes. In reality, with this kind of theme, this movie can never be made in the socialist countries. Even if it was filmed, it can never pass the government's censorship, and the directors, actors might be banned for a long, long time.Only in USA, can people have the freedom to make a movie like this. Even though money talks in the court room, at least, some of the soldiers got sent to prisons for a long time. Those are the reasons why there are so many people say that they are proud to be US citizens.These kind of things probably happen all over the world. In other countries, some people might even protest against the director just for making such a movie because it is not 'patrotic'.I watched the extended cut on DVD, so it felt a little long. The performance is solid. The girl was very real, it felt as if she was really the girl from that real story. What a tragic story, it made me cry. From what I have seen in the extra interviews, the director seems to be the first super nice director I have ever seen, who has some high moral standards. Because of that, he was the one who actually made this movie a reality.By the way, it seems that my comment is the 100th for this movie, great!",8,0,4,28 January 2009
Shrek 2," very funny with a predictable ending.
","It is rare that a simple animation film can be so funny. The story is quite simple and predictable. But the people who worked on this film made it an excellent comedy. They are probably the first people who blended so many modern US culture into the old prince-princess story. I am sure that there will be more films copying this concept. While it is very funny now, I doubt that it will become a classic for the later generation to enjoy. Because culture constantly changes, what we know now won't be the same in the future. And since this film has so many Americanized culture icons, I also wonder if the rest of the world would enjoy this film as much as we do.",8,0,0,29 June 2004
Black Hawk Down," A very realistic, bloody war movie. Is this accurate at all?
","I wonder where I was when I first saw this movie in 2004. I totally don't remember it. I just watched it again, a few days ago. And I was going to submit my rating on here, then I was surprised that I already rated this movie. Anyway, I was wondering where Mohamed Farrah Aidid is now. And I found a news report from BBC, with the title of 'Warlord thumbs down for Somalia film', if you search for it online, you can read it yourself. It seems that what we are seeing is a Hollywood version of that story. Could it be accurate as some viewers claimed on here? Were they there when it happened? After all, did they read the news directly from the Somali news agents? I doubt it. As the warlord told the BBC reporter, 'I don't recall myself that somebody has interviewed me in this regard and I have never given neither written nor verbal authorisation to anybody.'If they are doing a movie about someone in the US or Europe, I am sure that they will have plenty of lengthy interviews with that person. This is indeed the typical US arrogant attitude toward third world people. There are always two sides to the same story. So you might be deeply moved by what you saw in this movie, but you don't really know how the Somali people think about that event? After all, only about 19 US soldiers died, while over 1,000 Somali people were killed. How would you feel if someone killed that many people in your very own city in your own country?This movie is good entertainment for anyone who wants to see how soldiers fight in an urban setting, but just don't assume that everything you saw is all real.The following was writing on 25 April 2004. Even though I have never participated in any war activities, and I hope that i never will, I think that this movie has given us a very realistic powerful view on the cruel bloody war. close to the end of the movie, it is emotionally shocking to see an old man holding a dead boy's body walking pass right in front of a war tank car. Whoever decide to put that scene in the movie did an excellent job of giving out the powerful message about the importance of peace.For the first 30 minutes or so, there were several clues about the soldiers making wrong life decisions, because they thought that this mission would be easy and short. And I was also thinking the whole mission will probably be over in the next 30 minutes of the movie. I was wrong, the war was so dangerous, full of blood, full of chances of death. Even thought it is more than two hours long, I was complete clued to the screen.The thing is that this real war all happened when I was living happily in the US. the soldiers were killed, the local people were fighting for their own justice. it is a war that neither side wants to happen, but they defend for their own believes. and i wasn't even aware of it, like the rest of the people, we were just minding our own business. the war in Africa was only a gossip to most of us. It is futuristic and ironic, when one of soldier mentioned that the war in that African country was much worse than the war happened in Iraq. Comparing with the war that is ongoing in Iraq, what this movie is shown is only a tiny fraction of the cruelty of the modern wars, yet it is very powerful to give us the realistic view of what a war can bring. I hope that everyone who watched this movie would come to realize that peace is the best solution that we can ever ask for.",8,0,0,25 April 2004
Into the Wild," Very boring, he is NOT a hero at all,he died for nothing, period.
","Well, I usually agree with the ratings on this site, but I am surprised about this high rating for this movie. It is definitely overrated. I rated it a 6.It is very boring, too long. And the scenes jump back and forth, so it was a little confusing. When I watch a boring movie like this, I read a book, magazine, newspaper while it plays on the background. And that is what I did when I watched this DVD. It was so boring that I had to watch it in three nights.The only reason that they made this movie is because he is a white guy from a middle class family. It is just that simple.There are plenty of street bums like him living on the streets, in the wild. They don't bath, they don't eat proper food, they are dirty all over. I am sure that you can find some veterans who fought in some glorious wars, who ended up living on the streets just like him. How come they don't make a movie about those people? Did this guy do anything great? nothing. Did he save anyone's life? No. So what is so great about this guy? nothing.He could have used those free time to volunteer to save the world, instead he chose to live his life without any purpose. In a way, you can say that this guy is weird, he thinks differently than normal people. He thought that he was invisible, so he didn't have a cell phone, just in case there is an emergency.Yes, it is sad that he died, but he is just an ordinary man. People die all the time.Suppose that someone made another movie about a non-white homeless man who traveled all the way to Alaska to live in the wild, what rating will that movie get? Surely, not many white people will like to watch that even though the story will be exactly the same.",4,3,5,25 August 2010
Life Is Beautiful," Life is so touching.
","My tears poured out at the right end when the boy met with his mother. It was the darkest time of their life, the father acted like a clown, but he truly is the hero. He made this movie so funny even in the depressed period.
I was still hoping that the german soldier did not shoot the father in the corner. In my mind, he might come back live at the end of the movie. But he didn't. He sacrificed his life just like the millions of the jewish people. His demise is merely nothing, but his attitude certainly prevail over Nazis.",10,1,3,2 May 2001
Reservoir Dogs," I don't see how good this is?
","I have to say that this movie was not as good as I expected. First of all, it is a crime movie which is not my type of movie. Second, it was too violent. Those kind of things probably happen in real life, but I don't like to watch those kind of movies to get the shocking effect. And I certainly don't see the reason why people rated it so high. It is like one of those abstract paintings, some people rate it high because everyone else is saying good things about it. It is the group thinking mentality.The story is not so complicated at all. It is more like a theater performance rather than a real movie. Most of the time, it all happened in the warehouse. It was definitely too violent and bloody. And what do people get out from this movie? not much. There are better crime movies out there for sure.",7,0,2,24 December 2007
The Fountain," what is so good about this movie?
","About twenty minutes after the movie started, I was still clueless about what the story is. I got this movie title from one of the forum message about time travel on here, and this rating is so high, so I thought that I have to watch it.This movie is just quite boring, the story is not coherent, it gets quite confusing after a while. I don't really know what they are trying to say, why is that guy floating in the middle of the air. Why did the man bury his wife in the middle of nowhere in a snow covered empty space? This movie is more like a special effect documentary than a typical movie. And sometimes, the music is strange, it makes me kind depressed momentarily or at least made me feel unhappy.If you watched the special feature, the director admitted that he was in Australia for two years, and the movie got shut down by Warner brother Studio. Well, that wasn't a bad decision. The idea is good, but the movie is not coherent, the stories were all over the place.This is just one of those movies that you wish that it can end faster. So finally, I just started to read a book while it was playing in the background. I don't want to miss anything, but I don't want to waste another hour watching it without doing anything else.",4,0,3,14 August 2009
The Departed," The original was not that long, and way better and intense.
","This movie is too long, and it has too many twists which made it less intense than the original movie.There was no reason to put in so many twists and killings which only made this movie a little confusing and illogical. Even gangsters don't just kill random people everyday. They could have focused on the two main characters, made this movie shorter, that would be a little more interesting to watch.I wasn't sure that this was the copy of the Hong Kong movie until I saw cpt. queenan got thrown from the roof top.Overall, this is a bad copy of the original movie due to its bad storyline. Of course, it had so many famous actors. Otherwise, it could never have got such a high rating, even higher than the original movie.",7,2,4,8 November 2010
Scream," Not a scary movie at all.
","I watched it late at night alone. I didn't get scared at all. To me, this movie is such a joke, it is a bad joke. It tries to be scary, but those scary things only make me want to laugh. Yet I can't laugh, because those are not funny enough. Everything is so  predictable. The only thing that I was not able to predict was that the real suspect is actually acted out by two person. One of the guy just has that face and act which I can tell from the very beginning.
This movie has so many flaws. For example, why did the girl has to go through a cat exit on a garage door when the garage door can be opened by herself? What kind of idiot would try to go through a cat exit on a garage door? It is SUCH a common sense what the exit is for, and why it is only that big. I can't see a particular reason to kill her. There is no reason to kill her, because she is a girlfriend of one of the psychos. There are so many things in the garage that she can grab to defend herself.
Another example, at the very beginning of the movie, how did the killer cut out the girl's boyfriend's gut remotely? What is the reason of killing the school principal? And how did the killer get in and get out? How did the killer hide his costumes? How did the killer kidnap the father, etc, etc.This movie is neither scary, nor sophisticated.I am surprised that there are actually two sequels to this simple movie.",3,1,5,15 June 2001
The Deer Hunter," This movie is too long!
","I have heard about this movie for a long time, but I never got a chance to watch it even though I am already familiar with the theme music. I was finally able to check out the DVD from a local library. I was surprised that it is 3 hours and 3 minutes. I thought that it was the extended version, it seems that the original movie is really that long!It certainly is too long, especially the first half of the film. It has many unnecessary details. If it didn't win the best picture of 1978, I would have stopped watching it entirely. It has a lot of unnecessary scenes. For example, it has several long minutes of people dancing at a wedding party at the beginning. Sure, if the director want to show people how happy they were before going to the war, after all, this is not a musical film.The color of this film is mostly dark, it is lack of bright light. That made this film less appealing. The performance was solid though. The closed caption sometimes referred to those vietnamese people talking as 'speaking Chinese', that is not correct.",7,0,1,9 June 2008
300," weak storyline
","I heard some good things about this movie, so I checked it out from my local library. It was not as good as I expected. And I was surprised to see that this movie currently has 8 stars.The main thing is that the storyline is weak. There was nothing that was out of the ordinary. A total of 117 mins, it was definitely too long. The storyline can be concluded into one or two sentences.The visual effects are great, that was probably the reason why so many people liked it. And they used a dark brown lens, so everything looked so brown. If it was shot in the natural color, it probably would not have looked so great. This movie was too bloody, you see heads flying in the air, arms getting cut off, etc. Visual and sound effects are the best part of this movie In the end, there was nothing that is memorable. I certainly won't watch it for a second time, due to its lack of meaning or inspiration storyline.",7,0,1,2 January 2008
Atonement," This movie is too long, and storyline is very simple.
","I didn't plan to write a comment, because this movie is not very good at all. The rating is at 7.9, and I don't see a big deal about this movie. So I am writing my part of comment.This movie is over 2 hours long, and I can summarize the whole story in one sentence. It is just that simple. If it were not for the good acting and good cinematography, i would have stopped watching in the middle of it. After an hour or so, I just started to read a book, while it was playing on TV.It could be easily shorten to 1 hour and 30 minutes, and still tell a story. It is not an epic story, it is just a silly jealousy story among sisters.",7,0,6,9 August 2009
