Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 - long and boring
","One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time, not even close to the original. Paid good money to watch a boring people, boring special effects, holograms included, boring story line, no suspense or plot, I started to think, who are these people. As the movie trudged along, I thought the girl behind he glass was Rachel and Decker's daughter but Joe was her brother, that was wrong, but I got the girl right. Sean Young should be happy that she did not appear in the dog of a movie. Don't know who wrote it but was a combination of other sci-fi movies thrown together, except the original. Hope there is never going to be a Blade Runner 20 whatever. I could not wait until the movie was over and I could leave the theater and go home.",2,2,4,30 December 2017
Passengers," Passengers - an enjoyable movie
","There are a lot of spoiler alert in this review. Don't remember ever seeing any advertisements about this movie because I fast forward all advertisements on my DVR. The actors were really good, Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora, Chris Pratt as Jim Preston, Lawrence Fishburne as Gus Mancuso, Michael Sheen as Arthur, the android bartender, his character, to me was more interesting than the humans, human top and a pole that held him up that ran on tracks, Andy Garcia was a mystery to me, the only thing he did was get off the elevator and look around in amazement at the birds and trees on the spaceship at the end, nothing else. Jim Preston woke up 90 years to early because of a computer malfunction because of a space collision, he woke Aurora up three years latter, on purpose because he was a drowning man as Gus Mancuso puts it, a drowning person will take someone with him. Gus Mancuso woke up about the same time as Aurora because of a glitch in his hibernating pod that proved fatal to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have watched it two or three times. If there are any negative reviews, watch it for yourself, make up your own mind. Don't let the minority rule the majority.",9,0,2,16 January 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Definitely not a Harry Potter movie, not even close
","When Eddie Redmayne spoke, he mumbled all his lines, a reviewer for a high brow publication called it 'ANGELIC MUMBLING', whatever that's supposed to mean but mumbling is mumbling and not a second language to me, he was very hard to understand. J.K. Rowling or Tim Robins must have told Eddie Redmayne to mumble all his lines. Whenever he had anything to say, I had to ask my friend who went to the movie with me, what did he say, the response she gave back was I don't know, I couldn't understand it, the movie theater's don't have closed captioning which would have helped with the movie. The supporting actors and beasts, in my opinion, were more interesting than Newt Scamander, who never made any eye contact with anyone and acted like he had psychological problems and also reminded me of a very nerdy Doctor Who, Matt Smith, who should have been considered for the part. There was no special effects inside the suitcase scenes depicting an outside world because when there was a breeze or someone got to close they would move and show exactly what they were, a painted canvas scenes on a movie set, should have used special effects, would have helped out.",Null,5,8,20 January 2017
