"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," An inspirational and moving tale
","This film is about an unsuccessful man who walked out of his wedding. Five years later, he tries to win back his woman by participating in a marathon.Instead of being a ridiculous tale of a man doing silly things, 'Run Fatboy Run' is an inspirational and moving tale of a man who strives to achieve his goal. Dennis' enormous determination and perseverance shown in the film is deeply touching. Libby and Jake are also very likable characters, providing Dennis a reason to live and fight.The scenery is remarkable, and every London outdoor scene can be on a postcard! The marathon scenes by the Tower Bridge are quite amazing, as I am sure it took a lot of effort to organise such a massive shooting in the centre of London.Another reason to enjoy 'Run Fatboy Run' is the light hearted delivery of the material. Many funny jokes are thrown in as the backdrop of a moving tale, which successfully entertains without making the film cheesy or less credible. 'Run Fatboy Run' is surprisingly entertaining and engaging. It definitely is a runaway success.",Null,2,5,20 March 2008
Ford v Ferrari," Intense and enjoyable even for a non racing fan
","I have no interest in racing, yet I was still entranced by the captivating races. The film is not just about speed, but about brotherhood, determination and conscience. It's about telling a great story that makes you root for the character in question. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, even though I am not a racing fan at all.",Null,4,10,16 November 2019
The King's Speech," A touching historical drama
","This film is about King George VI and his long battle to overcome his stammer.I like the 'The King's Speech', as it can be interpreted in two ways: the speech that the king gives, and the king's way of speaking. The film is about both of these interpretations. It is quite an achievement to make something that does not sound so interesting into something so captivating and touching. King George VI's lack of confidence and his fragile psychological state is well portrayed by Colin Firth. He has the charisma, charm and acting skills to make his character so interesting and sympathetic. He shows that human side of a supposedly strong character well. 'The King's Speech' is a touching historical drama.",Null,5,10,29 January 2011
Despicable Me 2," A marginally adequate brain-off entertainment
","This animation is about the super villain Gru, who is recruited to fight another villain's plot to take over the world.'Despicable Me 2' has very cute characters doing silly things, which is fun to watch at times. The minions are so silly that they got me chuckling many times. However, the charm of the film ends there. Maybe I am not the right age or the right demographic, but I find 'Despicable Me 2' just a little to silly. It is a simple hero versus villain film, with very little to engage the adult viewers. The emotional subplot the search for a mother is just too thin to make any emotional impact.In recent years, animations are so good that viewers are completely spoilt. We expect a visually appealing film with fun, jokes and emotional subplots, plus an obligatory moral lesson. 'Despicable Me 2' might have been a good film fifteen years ago, but it is only a marginally adequate brain-off entertainment for the high standards nowadays.",Null,4,8,28 June 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Scary but disappointing
","This film continues to explore the Lambert family's connections with the world beyond our own.The first 'Insidious' was outstanding because it had a simple and straightforward plot, and yet it delivered the scares and thrills. 'Insidious: Chapter 2' develops from there, but the plot is more complicated. The human world and the further merges, and it could become confusing for some. The addition of a psychopathic character and a grossly perturbed mother may have heightened the thrill, but puts me off because it destroys the simplistic beauty of the first plot.The scenes leading to yet another sequel is entirely unrelated to the Lamberts and is just so contrived. I am slightly disappointed by 'Insidious: Chapter 2', even though I was scared by it.",Null,0,0,29 December 2013
The Lobster," An interesting take on a dysfunctional society
","This film tells the story of a group of people who are taken to a hotel, where they have to find a partner within forty five days. If not, they will be changed to an animal of their choice.'The Lobster' is very different from any film I watched recently. The tone of the film is strangely eerie without any eerie or scary effects effects. It achieves the strange feeling by strange societal rules and impersonal interpersonal interaction. Though I say strange, if you think hard about the society depicted in the film, it actually echoes a lot of the real world, only more exaggerated, organised and disturbing. It is a very interesting reflection on the strange world we live in, and makes us realise that our world is more dysfunctional than we cognate.",Null,1,4,17 February 2016
Moneyball," Way overrated
","This film is about the general manager of a baseball team, who tries an unconventional statistical formula to pick his team.In contrast to Clint Eastwood's 'Invictus', where they showed a football game for 30 minutes and make it a poignant emotional high, 'Moneyball' does not achieve this same level of emotion at all. There is in fact no emotional zenith in 'Moneyball'. There are no motivational speeches, no players striving for excellence and no sign of ecstasy even when winning a record breaking streak. Instead, we only get to see Billy Beane looking lost and miserable the whole time. There is a serious lack of tension and engagement. 'Moneyball' is way overrated in my opinion.",Null,4,6,19 December 2011
Whip It," Action, emotions and dreams all in one
","This film is about a small town teenage girl who pursues her dream in professional roller skating without her parents' knowledge or consent.'Whip It' is a familiar story about a girl who struggles against the tide to achieve her dreams. The story telling and pacing is not bad at all. I like the emotional subplot of Ruthless' parents expectations and dreams towards her, and how the parents change their attitude in the end. I would like more character development of the teammates though, it seems they are in the film only to make up the number needed for a team.As Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, it shows that she is capable of more than looking pretty in a romantic comedy. Let's hope her next project can maintain this standard.",Null,0,4,26 March 2011
The Avengers," A great blockbuster
","This film tells the story of a team of superheroes who save the world from an evil and ambitious extraterrestrial man.Being a blockbuster, 'The Avengers' does have all the elements to entertain the crowd. The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing. The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on. I enjoyed the film a lot.",Null,5,8,18 March 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Simply boring
","This film tells the story of a modified, manufactured man who hunts down and kill old versions of manufactured men. The discovery of a secret makes him re- evaluate his life and values.It is unfortunate that'Blade Runner 2049' is so desperate to impressed with great lighting, to the point that it ignores the story. Scenes drag on several times the length needed to tell a story, making the film overly long. The first hour already felt like eternity, and the next 100 minutes were even longer. People in the cinema were restless, head resting on hands or just looked at the ground because it was so boring. The story was thin, and could have been told in a short time. Even the drowning scene had no sense of thrill, urgency or threat. It is simply plain boring.",Null,93,193,10 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Feeling good
","This film tells the story of a struggling businessman who comes up with the idea of finding cricket players from India to play baseball, with a publicity drawing recruitment scheme called 'The Million Dollar Arm'.A Disney film is always a feel good film, and 'Million Dollar Arm' is no different. What amazed me was the fact that Indian culture and people are so strongly portrayed in the film. From Insian food, customs, music and dancing, India is almost encompassing in the film. There is even a scene outside Taj Mahal, which is very impressive. Disney will break into India further with his film, and I am very happy that Disney is embracing various cultures round the world.Back to the film itself. There is little about the actual practice sessions of the future baseball players. It tells little about their hard work put into making their family and country proud. Yet, there is still ups and downs from other events happening in the space of ten months. If there was more coverage on their hard work, which ultimately pays off, then I would have liked it even more.",Null,0,0,10 February 2015
Angels & Demons," An amazing and intelligent thriller, one of the best in years!
","This film tells how Robert Langdon helps to save the Catholic Church by decrypting a poem supposedly left by a secret organisation that is seeking revenge against the Church.'Angels & Demons' has a captivating story and I was wholly captured by it. The film goes straight to the point about the impending calamity facing the Church, with no beating around the bush. This is what thrillers should be! The pacing is quick, leaving no time for breath at all. There is always a sense of urgency in the air as everyone has to race against time, making the plot very thrilling.The ending is amazing. Just as I thought the film was ending, there was a twist, and another. Who would have predicted the ending? 'Angels & Demons' excels in delivering two hours of pure intellectual adrenaline. I can safely say it is much better than 'The Da Vinci Code'. 'Angels & Demons' is one of the best thrillers I have seen in years.",Null,7,21,14 May 2009
First Man," Enjoyable
","This film tells the story of the years leading to the first man walking on the moon.The story focuses on the human aspect of the journey, which makes it more engaging than a focus on the technical aspect of the hugely complex mission. The conflicting feelings Neil Armstrong has days before the mission is really well depicted. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,0,3,16 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A thrilling film
","This film tells the story of the victors of the Hunger Game who inspire an uprising against the government.This installment of 'The Hunger Games' departs from teenagers killing each other in the game, and moves into the political arena. It's a surprisingly well composed and well told story, and I was surprised to see that it is very effective in stirring up my emotions. Jennifer Lawrence is very good as the heroine, she has the amazing quality of being adorable and yet confident. She shows a wide and convincing range of emotions, and the way she speaks to the camera for the people is very passionate and stirs up the fire inside viewers.It's a thrilling film they kept me on edge all the time. It positively surprised me and I really look forward to the next film.",Null,4,24,2 December 2014
Vertigo," An interesting story
","This film tells the story of a detective who is hired to follow the wife of a ship yard owner. He falls for the wife soon after the investigations.The story goes quite slowly, and confuses me at first. After the mystery is revealed, it becomes a romantic film, which is quite a surprise to me. It is a good film, especially it is interesting to see that the famous landmarks of San Francisco haven't changed in the past sixty years!",Null,1,3,25 December 2017
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Excellent costumes!
","This film is about two drag queens and a transsexual woman's journey into the middle of nowhere in the Australian desert. They performed drag shows in the conservative areas, with predictable reaction.The script can easily be seen to be entertaining and humorous. What I find the most entertaining are the costumes. The endless parade of colourful and flamboyant costumes is dazzling and breathtaking to say the least. What amazes me the most is the scene in which a drag queen stands on top of a traveling bus, with her costume stretching tens of metres in the wind. The tail of the costume flies and waves in the wind, it is so graceful and beautiful, as if it was a demonstration of their pride to the world!I also applaud the filmmakers for making a film about this topic. It is not every day that films like these get made!",Null,1,3,2 October 2006
Black Swan," An exotic look at an unintentional self transformation
","This film is about a ballerina who takes on a role in Swan Lake. She transform from an innocent and perfectionist woman to an evil and self destructive woman.Darren Aronofsky's films are usually not easy to digest, so I find 'Black Swan' surprisingly easy to understand. It details Nina's path of transformation as she prepares for her role that requires her to perform out of her character. The imagery and paranoia are very well done; it may be weird and disturbing at times, but compared to Aronofsky's previous work, it is already very mainstream. It successfully portraying Nina's mind as fragile and unstable. The film is captivating, engrossing and manages to keep me interested throughout. Natalie Portman's Oscar buzz is well deserved, and the performance of Mila Kunis is also worth mentioning. In short, 'Black Swan' is an exotic look at unintentional self transformation. You either get it and like it, or you don't.",Null,0,4,6 January 2011
Changeling," Another profoundly moving film from Clint Eastwood
","This film is about a single mother whose son has gone missing. Five months later, the police finds her son, but she insists the police have made a mistake.I have always found Clint Eastwood's film profoundly moving, and I have expected 'Changeling' to be so. Only 'Changeling' surpasses my expectations, and moves me right to the core. What Christine Collins has to go through is completely shocking and saddening. Her unwavering struggle for truth is truly inspiring. Angelina Jolie's perfect acting of an anxious but hopeful mother is amazing, she brings her character to life, connecting with the audience on multiple levels. No wonder Angelina Jolie has stated in interviews that during the filming of 'Changeling' she was so worried about her children that she had to have at least half of her children in the set.The production is also excellent, with the sets and lighting all made just the right tone to fit into the mood of the film. I am also glad the ending is somewhat vague but gives enough hope for people to ponder on. 'Changeling' is deeply moving, whether or not you have children.",Null,4,6,27 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," It's great, even the 3D effects!
","This film is about Captain Jack Sparrow and his coerced voyage to find the fountain of youth that is heavily sought after by various individuals and even countries.People in Hong Kong are lucky to get 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' earlier than the United States, and even luckier is that most cinemas here already have evening shows the day before its official release.'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' has very good 3D effects. I have not watched a lot of 3D movies, but this is easily the best I have seen. Instead of the layered 2D effects that they call 3D, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' has real 3D that gives you the feeling that you really are there at the scene, watching events unfold.The plot is easily understandable, straightforward but very engaging. It's more action and adventure this time than previous instalments. It's also more funny, even adult humour finds its way into this Disney production (involving a comment on the viewpoint of a missionary). The mermaids are visually stunning, and I really thought the first mermaid is Amanda Seyfried, but it's a woman called Gemma Ward.Of course, the ending paves way for a sequel. I am looking forward to the next one already.",Null,9,15,18 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Entertaining and well made
","This film is about Agent J going back in time to rescue Agent K from being murdered by aliens.My friends say that 'Men in Black III' is a brainless comedy, you can go in just for a few laughs and switch your brain off. After watching it, I can safely say that I have another opinion.'Men in Black III' does have its brainless moments. It can be politically incorrect too, but it is entertaining and fun to watch. Special effects are realistic, and the scene involving a very tall building made me so nervous that my palms perspired a lot! The ending is very touching; I certainly did not see it coming even though a friend guessed it.I think it is great that 'Men in Black III' manages to combine emotional elements in the middle of mainstream blockbuster entertainment. I look forward to the next film in the series already.",Null,59,89,5 June 2012
Frost_Nixon," Never feels boring despite the sedentary nature of the film
","This film is about a British talk show presenter preparing for the make or break moment of his career, and creating a memorable interview in the television history.I worried that 'Frost Nixon' would be boring as it was based on a TV interview, but I am glad I was wrong. 'Frost Nixon' turns out to be engaging and emotional. Despite the sedentary nature of the film, it never feels boring. There is a lot of intellectual war going on which makes it engaging to watch. Frost's initial interviews are well done to show how Nixon has the upper hand. It captures Frost's despair and enormous stress perfectly, and I felt sorry for him to ruin his career and his pocket. Nixon's tough and confident image is contrasted by an emotional speech at the end, which stirs up much emotions.It is remarkable that the emotional climax is filled with much silence, contrary to most of the movies out there. This is the beauty of great direction and execution.",Null,1,3,21 December 2008
Walk the Line," An engaging and vibrant biopic
","This film is about the rise and fall of the popular singer Johnny Cash.Though I have never heard his music before, 'Walk The Line' successfully captivates my interest to learn more about this singer. I admire his perseverance to succeed, and I am saddened by his downfall caused by drugs. Cash's relationship with his wife and with Carter are both engagingly portrayed. Reese Witherspoon is charming, showing off her trademark sweet smile in between her great range of acting skills. The songs are upbeat and vibrant, making the music performances on stage a pleasure to watch. The only one complaint I have is the accent which the actors speak in. It makes the film a little hard to understand, and it is hard to concentrate fully when the film is over two hours long.",Null,1,1,6 August 2008
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Guilty pleasure!
","This film is a fictional account of a Kazakh TV presenter going to US of A to learn the American culture for the benefit of the people in Kazakhstan.Yes, this movie is very politically incorrect. There are some shocking jokes about racism and sexism. However, when we put these issues aside, this film is in fact very creative. The film is a series of practical jokes made on various sectors of the society. The way that Borat makes us laugh is unusual, and is not often done in the film industry. Sacha Baron Cohen's acting is amazing. I was skeptical of him getting nominated for the best actor in major awards, but now I changed my mind. The fact that he can completely transform himself into someone else is remarkable!",Null,1,3,23 December 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Entertaining and fun
","This film is about Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson trying to outsmart the horrifying plot of Professor Moriarty.'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' is what a blockbuster should be. It is visually attractive, an adrenaline inducing plot mixing action and humour. The visual representation of Sherlock Holmes' power of observation was interesting, and the bullets in the woods were also visually stimulating. And the castle on the cliff at the end is so beautiful and stunning what made me go wow. The plot is intelligent in a sense, but it tells you everything so clearly, that viewers do not have to solve the puzzle themselves. Either way, 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows' is entertaining and fun to watch. I am already looking forward to a sequel!",Null,2,4,27 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Entertaining
","This film is about a scientist who got turned into a green monster after gamma radiation exposure. His quest to make things right is impeded by unexpected events.'The Incredible Hulk' has a great finale, but a weak beginning. I find the first 50 minutes far too slow. There can be generous trimmings and still does not affect the plot. In addition, how does Hulk in Brazil suddenly end up in Guatemala is not explained. In fact, there have been quite a few instances like this, which makes the story less coherent. The ending fight is quite breathtaking, it makes me engaged and I wish the fight occupied longer screen time. 'The Incredible Hulk' is good entertainment for the evening.",Null,0,0,20 April 2010
The Monuments Men," A touching portrayal
","This film tells the story of a group of American soldiers who are tasked with recovering art stolen by Nazi Germany in the second world war.It was a task that was seemingly insignificant, as there were many even more pressing issues during the war. But these men dedicated themselves to doing something that was right to do, something that would mean a lot for future generations. It's this almost altruistic spirit that makes this film touching, making it work. I enjoyed it, and I particularly liked Cate Blanchett's performance. I didn't recognise her at first, I subsequently did and I was captivated by her performance, especially when she invited the American soldier to her home.The ending is great as well, as it gives that emotional high that's needed in a film that deals with a grim topic.",Null,0,0,18 August 2014
Your Name.," A transcendental love
","This animation tells a story where a teenage girl from a rural town and a Tokyo guy juxtapose their bodies when they wake up one day. Their lives are strangely intertwined, until the day when a beautiful comet strikes the Earth.'Your Name' is a love story but it is not a conventional love story. It features time warp and body switch, which is very much science fiction. However, the tone of the film remains down to earth and innocent, so the science fiction element is at the background. The time warp makes me think hard to see if it is logical, and whether it creates any alternate parallel universe! The love story is sweet because it first tells how two people cope with their new strange lives, and then they develop a transcendental love that survives even the biggest impact.",Null,2,5,17 January 2017
Captain Phillips," A great film!
","This film recounts the hijacking of a US cargo ship by Somali pirates off the Horn of Africa back in 2009.'Captain Phillips' is an action packed, adrenaline pumping film. It wasts no time, and action already kicks in fifteen minutes into the film. It's a film of survival, the constant struggles to survive is well portrayed. However, I think the best scene is the last scene, where Captain Phillips is examined medically. It turns the run of the mill action film into a major tear jerker. It turns Tom Hanks from a fearless captain who calmly battle the pirates, to a human being overwhelmed with emotions. It is such a powerful scene, and sets 'Captain Phillips' different from just a mindless action film.",Null,0,1,29 December 2013
Sucker Punch," An entertaining film but forgettable
","This film is about a young woman who got admitted to a mental hospital, because she rebelled against her abusive stepfather.'Sucker Punch' is a stylish fantasy movie. Scenes are mostly composed of stylish action sequences, with slow motion in all the right moments. The music is cool as well, it gives the film more character, and augments the intensity of action scenes. The plot makes little sense though, and characters are poorly developed. It feels as if the characters are there solely for the sake of fighting, so that the filmmakers can make a film with loads of cool scenes.Even though 'Sucker Punch' is a forgettable film, it is still an entertaining film if you keep your brain turned off.",Null,1,4,8 September 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Overrated
","This film is about a shy high school misfit who becomes a cool guy after two seniors taking him under their wings.'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' tells a story of a shy guy who blossoms socially as he develops friendships with two step-siblings. It involves the typical American high school life; with experimentation in sex and drugs, experiences with dating, fights and bullying. I can see how a lot of people can identify with the characters and events in the film, and hence 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' gets such a high rating. However, I think it is overrated. I thought it was a plain coming of age drama. It doesn't push that many boundaries, and there is nothing new. The story is not particularly captivating, and in fact the subtle subplots (involving flashbacks) can be confusing. My friends and I did not agree with the positive critics and the high ratings.",Null,27,56,19 January 2013
The Finest Hours," Quite a touching ending
","This film tells the story of an oil tanker that is split in half by unforgiving storms. Over thirty crew members struggle to survive, while four US Coast Guards mount a near impossible rescue mission to save the crew members.'The Finest Hours' starts off slow and tedious, as the subplots they introduce only serve as the backdrop for the later adventure. I would have liked more of the rescue effort shown on screen, and less time on land. Maybe it is for this reason that the film does not grip me and touch me as it should have done.Once Webber and his crew start the rescue mission, the film picks up pace significantly. The visual effects of the storms and the enormous waves are very good. Even though the ending is to be expected to end this way, it is quite touching nonetheless to see the outcome.",Null,1,5,26 April 2016
3:10 to Yuma," I didn't get into the film

The Equalizer," Feel good entertainment
","This film tells the story of a mysterious man who works in a home ware store. He is kind, calm and helpful. He also happens to be possessing unparalleled skills in handling extreme violence, combating mobs and king them with minimal tools.There is a lot of action and violence in the film, but it is made to look Denzel Washington cool. He can overpower mobsters easily, rectifying wrongs, tackling corruption and basically be the pillar of righteousness without looking for any gains or rewards. This selflessness makes me like this film a lot. Even though it may be a little over the top with his specialised skills, it offers feel good entertainment.",Null,0,2,17 February 2017
The Expendables 2," An entertaining action film
","This film is about a group of fighters who try to stop people from stealing plutonium from a disused Russian mine.The amount of action scenes in 'The Expendables 2' is quite mind blowing. The film starts off with a five minute street battle scene with heave artillery, and we don't even know why they are fighting. Forty minutes into the film, we finally know the aim of the mission. There is so much fighting, gun shots, aerial chases, bombs going off and heads blown off, that I sometimes forget there is actually a plot! It is s action intense that it becomes funny. For example, they slide off a wire and shoot bad guys, and they manage to kill someone with every bullet! Well, at least they are wearing bullet proof vest, so that makes it a little more believable.Dialogs are sparsely interspersed, and mostly they are one liners that are so bad that it becomes good. For example, 'I pronounce you man and knife' is just plain funny. The blood splatter from gun shots are so comical that it looks more like a paint ball fight. And characters burst out from nowhere and save the day! Oh how convenient! Don't get me wrong, 'The Expendables 2' is an entertaining action film, because of all the unlikely action scenes.",Null,1,2,15 August 2013
War Dogs," A success story that makes you think and reflect
","This film tells the story of a message therapist who goes broke because his business venture of selling luxury bed sheets does not work out. He is recruited by his childhood friend to make big money by bidding on military contracts.'War Dogs' touches on a mysterious aspect of the world which is not often talked about. Therefore, the story is already intriguing, and I want to find out what happens to the two guys. What they do might seem questionable to some, and their subsequent success gives much food for thought. The ending makes you think and reflect on the fine line between right and wrong; and how people can get caught up in their successes. Another god aspect is that despite the subject matter, the story manages to be funny yet still remains dramatic enough to be taken seriously. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,28,42,1 September 2016
Source Code," A mind blowing science fiction film
","This film is about a US soldier in Afghanistan, who wakes up and finds himself on a commuter train in Chicago.'Source Code' has a very good plot. Usually plots involving time twists have lots of plot holes, but this one is well thought out and actually makes sense. Viewers are given a very mysterious circumstance in the beginning, and the suspense is well maintained throughout the film. The romance subplot with the girl on the train is convincing too. They are so natural together even though Jake Gyllenhaal's character does not know her. Another great aspect is the fact that there is a touchingly subplot involving the god of something greater than himself. Such transcending act gives the film a humane side for people to ponder upon.'Source Code' is a mind blowing science fiction film. It kept me on edge throughout.",Null,1,2,30 August 2011
Skyfall," A great James Bond film
","This film is about James Bond having to crack down on an invisible enemy who is terrorising the MI6 through hacking.Right from the introductory scene, before the opening credits, there is already much action. No expense is spared, and no action is over the top. In just a space of a few minutes, they must have wrecked ten cars while rummaging through the heart of Istanbul. Its intensity gets the adrenaline pumping quickly. In the opening credits, Adele's song is haunting and atmospheric, building up the tension and anticipation of what is to come.Learning from the mistake of the ultra fast paced 'Quantum of Solace', 'Skyfall' is a normal paced thriller that keeps on moving but does not lose you. It keeps you on edge throughout, but not too attention-deficit that makes you lost in the myriad of subplots. The character portrayals are great, much detail is put on making characters real. The story is thrilling and engaging, 2.5 hours breezed past without me noticing how long it was. It is noteworthy that Bond has moved with the times, as he does not rely on gadgets anymore, but on information technology. There is even a reference on how gadgets are so last century! I enjoyed 'Skyfall' a lot, and I am already looking forward to the next Bond film.",Null,3,12,1 November 2012
The Young Victoria," A great production
","This film is about the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of Great Britain.'The Young Victoria' has amazing production. Every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail. The extravagant costumes, lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make 'The Young Victoria' very impressive. I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's angle, while from Melbourne's angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips.Story wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a grand scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.Overall, 'The Young Victoria' is a good film, and it would have been even better if it was longer, so that events could be properly explained without rush.",Null,31,43,4 June 2009
The Hangover," The funniest Vegas film I have ever seen
","The Hangover is about a group of 4 guys going to Las Vegas for a bachelor party just two days before the wedding.Though bachelor party films are so overdone, The Hangover puts a fresh spin on the whole concept. The delivery of the plot is refreshing, I like the way they have to find out what happened the night before as they wake up from their eventful night. It's so refreshing to see them trying to figure out what they did, and to see the shock of what they really did! The jokes are phenomenally funny, it's out of the world. Basically the film is unbelievably funny, you have to see it to believe it.",Null,3,6,30 July 2009
Iron Man 3," A great blockbuster
","This film is about Tony Stark investigating a series of explosions without traces of explosives.'Iron Man 3' is very good! The plot is great, well developed and paced. Unlike other recent blockbusters, there is a good mix of action and comedy, and more importantly the plot makes sense and makes you beg for more. It is refreshing to see a superhero with goofy moments and even anxiety attacks, reminding us that no one is perfect. The special effects are extremely fast, everything looks so real and convincing. The mid-air rescue scene is so breathtaking and beautiful, I could not take my eyes off the screen. I really enjoyed watching 'Iron Man 3'. And remember to stay until after the credits, when you will see Mark Ruffalo in a cameo scene.",Null,3,21,27 April 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Slow at first but exciting afterwards
","This film tells the story of the unfortunate man-made natural disasters in 2010, when an oil rig explodes and spills millions of gallons of oil into the sea. What's more said is that this disaster could have been preventable.This event is still fresh in people's minds, and I'm a bit surprised that such a recent event has already been made into a film. 'Deepwater Horizon' spends a lot of time building up the story, yet it still does not explain the technicalities enough for me to understand why all those tests are being done and what are they for. Honestly, the frequent shots of pipes underwater are more interesting than the test scenes! After an hour, the disaster finally happens, and it gets adrenaline pumping. The inclusion of the oil stained bird is a good touch as it reminds people of the environmental impact of the oil spill. Overall, 'Deepwater Horizon' is a little slow at first, but becomes exciting after a while.",Null,1,2,30 December 2016
Stop-Loss," A moving tale of the other side of wars
","This film is about three US soldiers who goes back home after the war in Iraq. One of them gets redrafted back to the army on the day he is supposed to be discharged from the army.I did not know about the plot of 'Stop-Loss', and hence I was in for a shock. 'Stop-Loss' is so different from other war films, as it portrays the other side of war. It does not tell how glorious wars are, but the physical and psychological traumas that entails from these gruesome wars. The portrayals of the trauma are very real, ranging from physical disability, flashbacks, difficulty adjusting to civilian life and disrupted social relationships back home. These problems are so real and authentic, making the plot so engaging and effective. I did not like the ending though, as I do not quite understand the psychological processes behind Ryan Philippe's character's decision.It is refreshing to view the life of a soldier from a different perspective, and I am pleasantly surprised by 'Stop-Loss'.",Null,1,1,13 December 2012
It," Scary
","This film tells the story of a small American town, that is plagued by a supernatural entity that kidnaps children one by one. 'It' is so scary. The plot is very believable and convincing. It feels so real even though I know it's not real. It's very heart breaking to see the children tormented by the clown, their own fears and the harsh real life circumstances. It is scary right from the start, and it only gets scarier by the minute. There were many moments when I just could not watch it and had to close my eyes. I'm definitely awaiting the next part of the story.",Null,7,19,7 September 2017
Hereditary," Stands out from the crowd
","What a brilliant story! It is a horror film that keeps a high level of tension, suspense and mystery. It really keeps me having palpitations for minutes so the end of the film. It stands out from the rest of the horror films because it doesn't follow the formula, doesn't require loud noises and doesn't require sudden movements to make you feel scared.",Null,1,4,30 December 2018
If I Stay," Touching
","This film items the story of a teenage girl who is very good at playing the cello. She meets a guy in a rock band and falls in love, but soon afterwards she has a traffic accident and is fighting for her life in the intensive care unit. I like Chloe Grace Moretz, and I think she's really good in this film. She plays the plethora of emotions very well. As her life plays before her, and also seeing the reality of the accident is very gripping. I'm particularly touched by the grandfather's speech to her at the bedside, while Adam's wishful attempts to bring her back to life is also touching. I could not predict what really happens at the end, which keeps me engaged throughout. I enjoyed it.",Null,0,0,7 July 2015
Detroit," Even more disturbing than I imagined
","This film tells the story of a night going desperately wrong in Detroit.I knew the film would be disturbing, so I have put off watching it. And it is really disturbing. I feel so so sorry for the residents of the hotel. No one deserves to be treated like this. This film shows me just how it is to be an ethnic minority in Detroit at the time. The injustice is just shocking. I sympathise with the victims, and really wish that justice could prevail.",Null,0,1,9 November 2019
In Bruges," Thrilling and funny at the same time
","This film is about two London hit men sent by their boss to wait for their next assignment in Bruges.I was put off by the slow beginning, as it meanders around the streets of Bruges without an apparent clear focus. This situation is completely changed once the cold blooded boss, played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes, appears. The story escalates to become a thriller, and yet it preserves comedic moments in a clever way without being silly. This is hard to achieve, but 'In Bruges' succeeds in making thrilling scenes funny. All three leads are great, cinematography is nice and the locations are beautiful. All these elements combine together to make 'In Bruges' an appealing film.",Null,1,3,21 January 2009
John Wick," Fun to watch
","This film tells the story of a retired assassin who is forced out of hiding by a gangster's son who doesn't know who he is messing with.I watched the sequel first then this film, and I think this film is more realistic than the sequel. At least in here John Wick gets hurt! It is stylish and is fun to watch.",Null,0,2,23 January 2018
Kung Fu Panda," Positively entertaining
","This film is about a panda accidentally getting selected to become the dragon warrior to fight off the ferocious beast.The story is straight forward but interesting enough to keep viewers interested. Playing against stereotype is the main theme here, with a big fat panda becoming an unlikely hero. The fighting scenes are well done, and it preserves a lot of Chinese elements, such as the scene where Shifu's stick touches the water (a move called dragonfly touching the water) when he gets the scroll from the ceiling. There are quite a few funny scenes, but I think the fat jokes and crashing into walls are overdone.Have faith and believe in yourself is also one key element in 'Kung Fu Panda'. I think such positivity is one of the key to the success of this film. It connects with every viewer, offering a dream where everyone can excel.",Null,2,4,5 July 2008
Rocketman," Some things work, some don't
","This film tells the life of Elton John and his decorated career.It is unavoidable to compare this with 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. This film has great costumes and great acting by Taron Egerton. However, I'm not sure about the story. It is not as engaging as I would like. It doesn't draw me in, and it lacks a poignant climax. Perhaps the ending is a bit too introspective to be entertaining.",Null,7,13,8 July 2019
A Star Is Born," A really powerful experience
","I heard good things about this film, but I dismissed them as I thought it was just because Lady Gaga was in it.After watching it, I have to say it's even better than what people say it is. The story is very engaging and powerful. The songs are beautiful, and the visual presentation of every scene is great. The story flows naturally, and draws you in. Very very good story telling.There is a scene when Bradley is waiting for Lady Gaga to finish rehearsal, the foreground is the background while the foreground is the background. It's clever and intriguing. I find this film a powerful experience.",Null,3,6,11 November 2018
Gravity," A gripping tale of survival
","Everyone has been talking about how amazing 'Gravity' is, and fortunately no one had spoilt the film for me. I was already stunned by the visuals of space right from the beginning. The magnificent views from an unearthly viewpoint, looking back at Earth with the bluish hue of the atmosphere around its edge is truly memorable. On the other hand, the trade off is that there is much dangers in space, let alone the challenges of the unfamiliarity and the weightlessness environment.In 'Gravity' we see the two astronauts in grave danger, and they have to fight against literally all odds just to survive. The magnificent desolation, as an astronaut had described, becomes deadly hopelessness. I cannot remember another film that made my palms sweat the way I did, and it's been a quite a while since I literally held my breath, waiting for critical events to unfold. 'Gravity' successfully delivers suspense in every scene, chronicling their impossible struggle to survive.'Gravity' is not just a film, but a gripping tale of survival in space that will engage even those who aren't astronomically inclined.",Null,2,4,11 December 2013
Lone Survivor," Brutal battles
","This film details the failed operation of US SEALS in Afghanistan to capture a Taliban leader in 2005.The title already gave the plot away, and the first scene confirms all suspicion of the title. Hence, viewers are already given a grim outlook for the respectable soldiers portrayed in the film. For the first forty minutes, nothing much happens. I was about to lose interest in it, thinking it was boring and uneventful. When action strikes, it strikes big time. It is brutal and violent that most of the time I had my eyes closed. It's so sad to see the soldiers in such desperate situations, and yet they combat valiantly until the last minute. There is little emotional or dramatic element in the plot, but it will still evoke much emotions because the battles are so brutally realistic. 'Lone Survivor' is certainly not a film for entertainment or an easy relaxing evening. Be prepared to see loads of nasty wounds.",Null,3,9,12 January 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Every scene is very funny!
","This film is about a certain Jewish man called Brian who lived in the Roman times. His decision to repel the Romans turned out to be a big adventure.'Monty Python's Life of Brian' is so funny that I laughed out loud so many times. In fact, the whole film is very funny! I am still laughing about Biggus Dickus! The dialogs are a complete riot. The haggle scene is just classic! I think even if you travel to third world countries, haggling will not be as insane as this. And another classic is the meetings that the revolutionaries hold. Those are simply hilarious! It's very refreshing to see such a laugh out loud comedy without much profanity or toilet humour. I have only one complaint though, the ending song was to long. I was hoping something would happen but the song keeps going on.",Null,4,11,17 July 2008
Wind River," A chilling tale
","This film tells the story of a young female FBI agent, who goes to a remote, snow covered Indian territory to investigate the death of a young woman.'Wind River' has a slow pace, in keeping with the icy cold environment and the grim topic. It tells why the hunter wants to help, and fortunately he does help work the investigation. It is a chilling take, because I could hardly believe the reaction of those at the workplace just outside the trailer. The community is depicted to be very unsafe, with many members of the community in jail or deserving to go to jail. Life is hard, just to keep living is hard too.",Null,0,3,16 October 2017
The Death of Stalin," A fast paced comedy
","This film tells the story of the highest ranking politicians with mighty powers in Moscow, who fumbles to do what they have to do when Stalin is found dead in a room.There are many ironic events happening, and they are very funny. The film depicts very well the omnipresent mistrust and paranoia in the society at that time, and it does so in a highly entertaining manner. There are many memorable characters, such as Vasily who acts crazy consistently. I don't know how historically accurate this film is, but I enjoyed watching it.",Null,0,1,2 April 2018
I'm Not There," Incoherent, illogical, incomprehensible, intolerable
","This film is about several altered egos of the singer Bob Dylan.Having just watched 'Walk The Line' minutes before watching 'I'm Not There', it really helps to put things into perspective. I tried paying attention throughout the whole film, but I did not understand a thing. 'I'm Not There' is a jumbled up, random collection of unrelated scenes, making no sense individually or combined. I tried to appreciate the film as if it was an art house film, but no, it is not an art house film. 'I'm Not There' is simply incoherent, illogical, incomprehensible and intolerable.I watched it only because my favourite actors and actresses are in this movie, and I can safely say that I wasted two hours of my life. How can big names like Cate Blanchett, Christian Bale, Richard Gere and Julianne Moore agree to star in this illogical mess? If it was not for the big stars, this film would have grossed zero dollars in the box office.",Null,8,14,6 August 2008
Wayne's World," A waste of time
","This film is about two friends who make their own local TV show. They prove to be wildly popular, until a producer buys their show and make it a national program.'Wayne's World' is a silly movie about two ultra silly man. Wayne is stupid and annoying, while Garth is neurotic and weird. Watching the two being juvenile and retarded brings me no pleasure at all. The lack of respect for others, and their lack of self respect frustrates me. If hilarity means humiliating others on national TV, being retarded and disrespectful; then I wonder what kind of world we are living in.Though 'Wayne's World' did make me giggle once or twice, but this movie is hardly entertaining.",Null,8,16,2 January 2009
Star Trek," A mix of thrill and humour
","This film is about James T. Kirk and his heroic rise to become the captain of USS Enterprise.'Star Trek' has great special effects which are stunningly real. It also has a tight and thrilling plot, which ensures some calamity happening once every ten minutes. The soundtrack is also very good, as it really enhances the suspense and thrill of the scenes, making viewers even more engaged to what was already engaging. To me, despite these positive points, I still find the plot confusing and very difficult to understand. I have more questions than answers after watching 'Star Trek'. Maybe it's because this is the first Star Trek film I have ever watched.",Null,2,11,21 January 2010
Fury," Effective and powerful
","This film tells the story of five soldiers in a tank, who valiantly enters deep into Nazi Germany in the Second World War.'Fury' is the name of the tank that houses the soldiers and keep them alive. It is also the raw emotion that fuels the soldiers to plough on, and the catalyst for the typist to transform into a brave soldier.The story is intensely captivating and moving. It tells how brave the soldiers are in advancing through enemy lines. Yet, it is also human. It shows love and innocence from the typist. It shows leadership and courage from the commander. And even the most courageous can get scared.There is much blood and many gory scenes, but they are not contrived at all. They are there to remind people the horrors of war. When the film ended, I was left dumbfounded for minutes because 'Fury' is such an effective and powerful film.",Null,0,4,5 November 2014
As Good as It Gets," Excellent!
","I watched the film not knowing I watched it before, and I was happy that I rewatched it. I wonder why the film did not make an impact on me the first time I watched it years ago. The acting was superb, the script was excellent, and Greg Kinnear looked really gay too!The film contains humour (not just the cheap toilet humour or tripping the stairs), love & the harsh realities of life. Jack Nicholson's performance as a psychiatric patient was very convincing. It was a little bit of a pity that Cuba Gooding got such a minor role, so minor that it only served to support Jack Nicholson's joke at the beginning of the film. This is probably the only flaw of the film.",Null,1,1,7 June 2003
Darkest Hour," Engaging
","This film tells the story of an unpopular official who is chosen to be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the critical hours in the Second World War.Initially 'Darkest Hour' looks quite like 'Churchill' which was released a few months ago. 'Darkest Hour' quickly sets itself apart and ahead, through the use of captivating story telling. The subplot about the secretary having a loved one in the war is handled quite differently in the two films, and I find it less melodramatic and more engaging in 'Darkest Hour'. This film drove me to tears quite a few times, as it is very moving. It stirs up emotions and spirits through its effective speeches and story telling.",Null,0,2,13 January 2018
The Maze Runner," Very enjoyable

Right from the start, we get to know the perils of the maze, and the changing circumstances that start to dawn on the youngsters. There are lots of ups and downs in the story. Bad things coupled with constant uncertainties bring me to the edge all the time, while there are scenes to lift up the spirits at times. Thrill and mystery is kept at optimum level throughout, which makes 'The Maze Runner' very enjoyable to watch. I really look forward to a sequel.",Null,0,3,8 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Too slow to be engaging
","This film is about two groups of people trying to sabotage a German Nazi film premiere in Paris.'Inglourious Basterds' as an interesting story, but it does not engage me as much as I hoped. The plot is quite thin, there is not much happening in two and a half hours. A lot of time is spent to make a shot atmospheric. As a result, the pacing is very slow, I keep having to wait a long time for something to happen. For example, the initial scene in a farmhouse lasted over 20 minutes, when in fact it could have been over and done with in five minutes. 'Inglourious Basterds' needs very generous editing to shorten the film, in order to enhance its thrill and suspense. The only reason I think that 'Inglourious Basterds' managed to be engaging in its current form is because people wanted the good guys to win, and hence stick to their seats to hope their desired finale happen.",Null,1,8,25 December 2009

I am impressed by the sheer imagination of almost every scene in the film. The visual presentation of Coraline' world (and the other world) is amazing, the animation is so real, whether it is wonderful dreamland or eerie creepy land.

This Is the End," Do not expect anything groundbreakingly deep
","This film tells how a group of film stars face an apocalyptic event, hiding in a multi-million dollar home.'This Is the End' is interesting as it shows film stars playing themselves in a party, making fun of themselves. This is a new idea to me, but the novelty ends there. The rest of the film features a bunch of best friends acting irresponsibly, in a very juvenile way. The dialog is at times so ridiculous that makes me wonder why the filmmakers thought it was a good idea. There is plenty of product placement, including chocolate and even a certain boy band.I guess 'This Is the End' serves the purpose of providing brainless entertainment. Just do not expect anything groundbreakingly deep. Not literally anyway.",Null,2,5,24 September 2013

It alternates between adrenaline and mischievous scenes. Scarlett Johansson is a great addition to the story, I was impressed by the way she pulled her character off. Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke also gave amazing performances.I was particularly impressed by the fights at the end. The fighting sequences are cool, and all the action happens against a visually spectacular expo. I think 'Iron Man 2' is worth watching just for the ending alone. I think 'Iron Man 2' is great entertainment, and it's even better than 'Iron Man'.",Null,18,39,30 April 2010

Matthew McConaughey did a good job as a sports adviser, going through highs and lows in his score predictions.

Al Pacino was also great, his intensity and ferocity for his role was palpable.Though the plot was predictable, it was still worth the watch.",Null,2,4,30 August 2006
Lords of Dogtown," A boring movie without an actual aim
","I did not have high hopes when I watched it as I don't even know how to skateboard. I watched it anyway, and it was a waste of my time.Someone must have decided to make a skateboarding film by putting a lot of skateboard scenes together with a few talking scenes in between. As a result, the film seemed like an incoherent mix of scenes put together. There is a plot, which is all the actors do their own thing in the film. I do not feel for any of the characters in the film, and the film did not make me care about the characters either. The only redeeming feature of this film is that the skateboarding scenes are really cool, but I could have watched these scenes on a sports channel anyway. There is no cinematography, no character development and no substance. The film feels so empty.",Null,9,24,20 May 2006
World War Z," A forgettable blockbuster but still entertaining
","'World War Z', directed by Marc Forster, is a big budget blockbuster among his diverse output. It starts with a jaw dropping scene of unexplained traffic chassis in New York city, followed by mass evacuation from zombies. Brad Pitt's character then attempts to find out what stated the outbreak, but his efforts (or the portrayal of such) is rather lacking in intensity. The plot then descends into a mindless cat and mouse chase, without much depth given to Abby characters. Although thrilling and entertaining, the plot is not very memorable or emotionally engaging. Though the scene of zombies breaking through a high wall is quite spectacular, it still is just a forgettable blockbuster.",Null,2,3,18 October 2013

However, they are waken up 90 years too early, and they have to find ways to cope with their situation.The special effects of 'Passengers' is really amazing. Right from the start, the spaceship itself is visually stunning as it is futuristic, simplistic yet stylish. The interior design of the spaceship is exactly my taste as well, and I am in awe of the nice cabin where there is this super stylish staircase. The story is captivating as it details how Jim Preston fights with himself about whether he should or should not do the deed.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall," An adequate romantic comedy
","This is a romantic comedy about a man who got dumped by his famous girlfriend. He escapes to Hawaii for a holiday, only to see her there with another guy.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is mostly a typical romantic comedy, with a guy having to decide which attractive ladies to have a relationship with. The portrayal of emotions he goes through is quite deep for a romantic comedy, but still the film maintains a light hearted attitude and deliver laughs. Mila Kunis is attractive and sexy, she is right for the role. Kristen Bell's feelings, especially towards the end of the film, is well expressed, making me feel a little sorry for her character.One interesting thing about 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is that it features quite a bit of male frontal nudity from Peter the leading man. Russell Brand also is not so shy about his body, but not to that extent.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is an adequate romantic comedy. It's not groundbreaking, but it is a good watch.",Null,0,3,13 August 2013
The Hunger Games," A bit long
","This film tells the story of a young woman who is forced to enter a death match that only one will live out of 24 contestants.While many people compare this film with the book is based on, I'll compare it with the Japanese film 'Battle Royale' which has a similar storyline. 'Battle Royale' is bloodier and more brutal, and it doesn't beat around the bush. This film, on the other hand, concentrates on plot development before the actual game begins. I was getting a bit impatient for the game to begin, and for people to really fight with each other. 'The Hunger Games' still show the struggle for social, cooperation and altruism like 'Battle Royale' does, but on a smaller scale. Jennifer Lawrence is very convincing as a brave young woman fighting for survival. I was amazed by her in 'Winter's Bone', and this time she amazes me again.The plot is tight but not eventful enough to fill up the 2.5 hour screen time. I am intrigued enough to want to watch the next episode, but I can't say I loved it because I think 'Battle Royale'is better.",Null,2,4,30 July 2014

Despite her short physical stature compared to her colleagues, she shines and makes her mark in the country of Zootopia, where all residents are speaking animals.'Zootopia' is a fun film with a consistently positive message. It tells how a bunny rabbit can succeed despite everyone around her saying she won't succeed. I like the message of the story, and I like the bull police chief even more because he is funny even though he is an oppressive bully. The fox is a memorable character as well, and as he recounts his childhood experiences, it will strike a chord with many viewers. I enjoyed watching 'Zootopia'.",Null,1,4,24 July 2016

The Cantonese title is 'Tsunami Miracle' which tells you the whole plot already. Despite the predictability, 'The Impossible' is a well made, event-packed tear jerker that surpasses my expectations. Fifteen minutes into the film, the wave comes. Even though it is an expected scene, and I have already seen it in the trailers, this scene literally sends chilling waves emotions down my spine. The subsequent story is engaging, sad and very touching. The miracle part is quite truly a miracle, that such coincidence could happen against all odds.The true story of one family is enough to touch the world, and let's remember that these events happened to millions of people just a few years ago. I hope the survivors have had their wounds healed.",Null,1,2,18 January 2013

Indeed, he changed so much that he becomes a well organised leader in an escape plan. Ed is so annoying, which forms the comedic backbone of the film. Barbara is shockingly simple minded, that I wanted to knock some sense in her on a couple of occasions. This basically means that the characters are all very engaging and well portrayed. The plot is good, the suspense is maintained throughout, and it keeps me on edge very often. I am not a fan of horror films, but I like this one.",Null,1,3,28 October 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Fantastic!
","This film really lived up to the hype surrounding it! I saw the first one and I forgot about the plot completely. Fortunately, this one was very memorable that I am sure I won't forget it. The plot was intense and tightly woven, and there was a nice balance of action and comedy in the film. The viewers laughed out loud so many times on those mischievous moments. The scene with fruits was so hilarious! Johnny Depp's acting was incredible. The facial expression on his face kept on changing, and he obviously thought deeply on what face to pull in each second of the movie. The make up is amazing. Those people on the haunted ship looked so terrible and yet so real! Having a starfish on the face or having corals on the shoulder showed that the costume designers and make up artists really put a huge amount of effort in making those characters real.The ending was great as well, the finale lasted well over 30 minutes, and it kept me wanting to know more. The fights were well choreographed and also looked comical enough to be entertaining.This film was fantastic. I can only recommend it!",Null,4,7,22 August 2006
Argo," A well made thriller
","This film is about a secret rescue mission by the CIA to save six American embassy staff in Iran.'Argo' is a well made thriller. The first half sets the scene for the dangerous mission, and it does so in an almost comedic style. The CIA has to choose the most unlikely and ridiculous cover for their mission, and it is so non-thriller like that it makes 'Argo' almost like a spoof comedy. The second half is a real roller coaster ride, especially the critical scenes where there is only a fine line between life and death. The scenes are very well done, with so much tension and suspense that I was on the edge throughout the process.

However, the story goes steadily downhill. Bryan Cranston's character is very annoying, unsympathetic and offensive. He doesn't know what respect is, and he just kills the film for me.

As he uncovers more information beneath the surface, his morality, loyalty and courage are tested.I am unfamiliar with Star Trek films, so the first on the planet with red plants really lost me. I thought it was going to be some kind of comedy, especially when Simon Pegg appears! Fortunately, after that scene, the story becomes more an adventure and thriller. The story is fun and thrilling. Dr Spock's strict adherence to rules is quite funny. I am quite lost as to why Simon Pegg was cast as an engineer. He is too well known for his comedic roles, and I cannot take him seriously in his role. In addition, the humour he portrays in his character is not in line with the general atmosphere and tension of the film. Maybe that is the reason that I think there is not enough tension and suspense in the film, even though the plot clearly intends to be tense and suspenseful.",Null,1,4,19 May 2015
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A rare romantic comedy with substance and heart
","This film is about the love life of a man after his wife asks for a divorce, as he gets groomed by a lady killer who can get any woman he wants.'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is a lot of fun, with loads of really funny scenes. Steve Carell acts great as a romantically inept man, his social skills in a bar is so bad that it just makes you laugh. Ryan Gosling is so charming and attractive, I think he really carries his character off. And the teacher is wildly funny too. There are many romantic entanglements between the characters, and at the end, the whole situation is so crazy that it is just outrageously funny.'Crazy, Stupid, Love' has got this other side as a semi-serious drama about love and how we treat our loved ones. The film seems to be happy and mischievous, and yet there are a few very touching scenes. I find the scene when Julianne Moore calls Steve Carell about the heater very touching. The scene where Steve Carell makes a speech at the end is even more touching. 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is a rare romantic comedy with substance and heart. I really like it.",Null,0,2,6 November 2011
The Rocker," A brain off comedy
","This film tells the story of a guitarist who got thrown out of a band that subsequently becomes super famous. He lives with anger for the next twenty years. All is changed when he gets his fame unexpectedly in an unlikely band.'The Rocker' is a fun comedy. It got me giggling a few times due to silly jokes. I like Christina Applegate's character, I think she's quite fun and lively because of her character's history of being in a band. The subplot of forgiveness and giving yourself a chance to be happy is a good message as well. By the way, Bradley Cooper fans beware, he has only got a very small role in the film, speaking only one line. Though I'll probably not remember it after a few months, I enjoyed watching this brain off film.",Null,1,2,8 March 2016
Public Enemies," How can a crime thriller be so boring?
","This film is about a criminal mastermind who is elusive to the American authorities back in 1930's.I cannot believe how boring 'Public Enemy' is. I already felt thoroughly bored after twenty minutes, and after one more hour it does not get better at all. There are many problems with the movie. Slow pacing is the obvious problem, as the filmmakers spend too much effort trying to make the film atmospheric. They have simply forgotten that as an crime thriller, we need more action to engage viewers. Instead, most of the film is just talking and talking. When it does show an occasional gun fight, it is unbelievably detached with no intensity or thrill. It is as if the gun shots are played on tape, and are not from the supposed fights. Another problem is that 90% of the scenes are far too dark. It is not fun to look at silhouettes or shadows continuously. When we do get to see faces, most of the time their eyes are hidden under the shadow of their hat. Without this eye contact, I feel disengaged and disconnected from all the characters.'Public Enemies' is a very boring movie for me. I struggled so hard to keep my eyes open, and I have to say I lost the fight.",Null,7,11,2 November 2009
The Babadook," a scary film
","This film tells the story of a woman who lost her husband in a cast accident. She raises her son who has serious behavioral problems. One day,they find a children's story book home,but it contains chilling images and disturbing messages. Gradually the messages become real, and their lives assets in horrific turmoil. The story is simple, but it's horrifying. It does not use cheap thrills or gore to scare. It's all psychology, all seemingly in her head, until the very end when the story takes a slightly different them. I enjoyed ensuing it. I heard good things about the film, and I'm not disappointed. The actress playing the mother must have been in much distress because her role requires her to be in constant distress.",Null,4,6,2 April 2016
The Other Boleyn Girl," Engaging and well-acted
","This film details the power struggle between two Boleyn sisters for the King of England.Normally I get lost in historical drama, but 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is surprisingly easy to follow. Anne and Mary both fight for the affection of King Henry VIII, and this struggle and the resultant emotions are detailed engagingly in the film. It is quite a heartache to see two sisters having to manipulate each other and hurt each other in the process, as they cared for each other deep down.Acting is excellent. Kristin Scott Thomas gives a memorable performance in the few seconds after she learns of the calamity that happens to her children. Scarlett Johansson is not just a pretty face, while Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance of all the emotions under the sun.'The Other Boleyn Girl' is an engaging and well-acted drama. I is definitely worth watching.",Null,0,2,6 April 2008

","This film tells the story of a family who becomes hunted by an identical looking family.The film has much suspense and thrill. The action keeps on coming, and you really want to find out what is next. It all is intense and engaging, until the final scene shatters everything. The final scene seems to be a twist, but it makes the whole plot turn up side down to the point of being senseless and a massive confusion.",Null,3,13,23 March 2019
The Danish Girl," A touching story
","This film tells a fictionalised version of the life of a Danish painter, who was the world's first transsexual person who completed sexual reassignment surgery.'The Danish Girl' is a touching journey of Einar Wegener's self discovery that he is in fact a she all along. Through modelling, he discovers that he is a woman deep inside. Einar Wegener and his wife both go through much emotions and struggles to get to a point where love and integrity triumphs. The story is very touching, but for some reason I do not feel as empathic or sympathetic towards Lili. Maybe it is because of Eddie Redmayne's omnipresent big smiles which look rather fake and overdone at times. It appears that he wears a big smile most of the time and also tilt his head downwards to give a more feminine presence, but to be honest he already looks very feminine without these two mannerisms. I am impressed by Eddie Redmayne, he looks very feminine (sometimes even more feminine than Alicia Vikander!) but the big smile is just over the top.Overall, I am touched by the story. I hope Eddie Redmayne will win the Oscar again.",Null,0,3,10 January 2016

Ice Age: The Meltdown," An adequately entertaining popcorn movie
","This film is about the animals living in an icy world, having to escape from an impending flood caused by the meltdown of the surrounding glaciers.'Ice Age: The Meltdown' is a fun animation, it entertains without requiring you to use any brains. The plot is engaging and entertaining enough, and the animals are cute and adorable. However, I find the plot too childish at times, and what the animals do can be quite annoying. The most annoying animal or thing is the squirrel with the acorn, it adds little to the plot, and only delivers some forgettable laughs. Overall, 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' is entertaining enough for a popcorn evening.",Null,0,0,30 December 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Great story with a lot of action
","This film is about a Persian boy who becomes a prince in the most unlikely way, and his epic adventure to save the world from a mysterious dagger that unleashes the wrath of Gods.'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' has a great story that makes sense. There is a lot of action, in fact it is so action and adventure packed that sometimes I wish they would slow down and put some quieter scenes in between the action.I also liked the bond between brothers theme getting highlighted many times. It subtly instills family values, and enhances emotional bond for the viewers. One minor drawback of the film though, is that Gemma Arterton does not appear enchanting or noble enough for her role. She just does not look convincing as a princess who just lost her empire.Overall, 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' is adequate entertainment for an evening.",Null,1,4,30 May 2010
Balls of Fury," A really lousy film
","This film is about a disgraced child prodigy recruited by the FBI to play ping pong ball in order to smash a triad society.I expected cheap and brain off entertainment, but wow, this movie is lousy beyond my expectations. The plot is contrived, inconsistent and ridiculous. The master is supposed not to have foreigner students, and guess what? Christopher Walken is a foreigner! The electrical suits look more like a kid's toy, but that's better than the panda which looks exactly like a toy. Execution of the plot is no good either. Camera work is bad, even for a comedy. Character development is non existent. How come Maggie Wong falls for Randy Daytona all of a sudden? There are lots of homophobic jokes in the film, but at the same time there are loads of half naked buys running around in shorts! It makes me wonder whether the homophobic jokes are thrown in so that they can put hot semi-naked guys in the film. How come Christopher Walken agreed to star in this film? he just lost all his credibility! Believe me, this film is bad.",Null,1,3,6 January 2008
Ted," What if Ted was human?
","This film is about a man who is the best of friends with a talking teddy bear.'Ted' is an interesting comedy that tells the story of a man who is over-attached to his teddy bear. The teddy bear goes against all stereotypes, as he indulges in sex, alcohol and drugs. The teddy is a cute transformation of a man's worst best friend. Ted derails all the good things in life that can happen to John, leaving him with irresponsibility, a lack of career and a failing relationship. If Ted was a human being, then the film would not be half as interesting and entertaining.Mila Kunis is very good as the girlfriend. Mark Wahlberg shows much emotions towards her, and they have good chemistry. I think 'Ted' is an entertaining adult comedy.",Null,0,1,22 October 2012

The Secret in Their Eyes," A powerful film
","This film is about a man working in the Justice Department trying to find justice in a rape and murder case, even with lots of obstacles and after 25 years has passed.'The Secret in Their Eyes' has a very well written plot. The story is told engagingly in an interwoven series of flashbacks and the present time, but it is never confusing. There are slow parts, and the constant dialog makes it hard for me to keep up with the subtitles. However, the plot is still told in an engaging manner, that makes viewers connect and sympathise with the characters' tragedy and the injustice behind it.

","This film tells the story of a young extreme sportsman who gave up because his friend died in a daredevil motorcycle stunt. He has to get into extreme sports again when he goes undercover for the FBI to stop a gang of daredevil criminals.The trailer of 'Point Break' looks exciting already, but I can say it does not do the film justice at all. The film itself is way more exciting and adrenaline inducing. The trailer in fact hardly shows you anything amazing at all! I was already amazed by the extended surf scene, I marvelled at how they managed to shoot such a beautiful surf scene work such enormous waves. Maybe it's computer graphics, in which case it's very convincing. Then there's snowboarding, skydiving and many other stunts that make my palms sweat continuously. The best thing is that there's a plausible plot, and it's engaging as well because of themes of brotherhood and righteousness. I truly enjoyed it.",Null,7,24,5 December 2015
Black Book," Wonderful masterpiece of war and psychological thriller
","This film is about a Jewish woman infiltrating the German Army during the Dutch resistant in the World War II.'Black Book' is really an astounding film. Despite the length of the film, every single second has its significance and cannot be cut out. The plot is so tightly woven and quick paced, we needed to pause every now and then to discuss what's going on and to clarify what's happening. The fact that we want to discuss it is an indication that we are very drawn to the plot and want to know exactly what happened. The story unfolds in a fascinating and gripping way that viewers beg for more.It's sad and yet thrilling that no one could be trusted. Good guys seem bad and yet bad guys seem good. It's a never ending struggle for Ellis de Vries, and I think this is one of the reasons that the plot is so engaging. At the end, the humiliation scene is particularly moving and disturbing. It is just one of the many shocking scenes, but they do not look out of place or contrived at all as it could have with other movies. That's another wonder of 'Black Book'.Carice van Houten is an amazing actress. I feel it's wrong that she didn't get an Oscar nomination for the best actress. She has a 40's quality, radiating elegance and yet mixed with all sorts of pain when she was being undercover. The rest of the cast is also very good. They collectively create a lot of tension and carry the film very well.It's hard to believe that 'Black Book' is directed by the same guy who directed 'Showgirls'. It's a much welcomed change, and I look forward to his next film.",Null,2,4,29 April 2008

It tells how desperate measures are needed in desperate times. Viewers connect with Aron Ralston easily, as it is not unlikely that an average person encounters an accident during a hike like he did. The particularly graphic scene is disturbing and unsettling, and yet it makes viewers' spirits high in the hope of the better evil winning against the clock.The accompanying soundtrack is very good, particularly the appropriately triumphant music that plays at the end. It's good that this amazing tale of survival is told to a wider audience, as I for one would not have heard about it if it was not for this film. It inspires and provokes thoughts about life.",Null,0,1,12 January 2011

I felt I was watching an extended music video to promote all of their songs.The worst thing is that the movie as no plot.

"I Love You, Man"," Adequate comedy, a refreshing reminder of friendship's beauty
","'I Love You Man' is about a man with little friends, who needs to find a best friend in a short time to be his best man in his wedding.There are not so many films about male friendships, 'I Love You Man' is a well made surprise. It centres a man who is about to get married, so the plot is more like a drama about how he is coping with his marriage and his failing real estate career. Humour comes in the form of two friends doing silly things such as jamming their favourite band's song, but I don't really find these scenes funny. To me, what makes this film stand out is the quality of their friendship. How they want each other's company, share their deepest secrets and have fun is amazing.

He gets his father's rival to coach him, and slowly fights to the top.'Creed' is quite special because it doesn't come across as violent as other boxing films. Maybe it's because a lot of screen time is dedicated to his training and the relationship between Creed and Balboa. The story is a gripping journey of a young man who is determined to succeed. The boxing scenes are very engaging, and I find myself holding my breath, eagerly waiting to see the outcome of the fight. I think the guy playing Creed is a good actor, he put on a good performance in 'Fruitvale Station' last time. This time, he seems to be overshadowed by Sylvester Stallone in the Oscars. I hope he gets more attention in his next films.",Null,1,4,19 January 2016

","This film details how Logan gets revenge after his girlfriend is killed by his brother, Victor.'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' has great special effects, but I think the plot is a little weak. The pacing is far too slow to be exciting and thrilling. The build up is too long, making the first half of the film 'all talk no action'.I think 'X Men' was successful was because the films have a lot of characters with different supernatural powers. The fights between various mutants are breathtaking. In 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', there are only a handful of mutants, and they do not have much chances of showing off their powers. Hence, I did not enjoy 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' as much as I hoped.",Null,8,26,29 April 2009

Kate Hudson is charming and mischievous, and she handles her role well. Matthew McConaughey and her have great chemistry together. The scenes where they begin to fall in love have romance and love everywhere in the air. They are so sweet and convincing. The time they spend together is almost like the perfect time one could only imagine.'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is so sweet and romantic. I really enjoyed this film.",Null,0,0,6 October 2008
Hot Fuzz," A comedic masterpiece!
","This film is about an elite London policeman transferred to a seemingly peaceful village due to jealous colleagues.Oh wow. 'Hot Fuzz' is so good! It is so amazingly funny. Every scene is set up to have a hilarious atmosphere. Every character is funny and likable in some way. Nicholas Angel is a righteous policeman, he is very good at what he does. He is a great contrast with the other village policemen, who are so lazy and mischievous. I enjoy watching the power struggle between Nicolas and Inspector Frank Butterman. The battles between them are clear, yet they do not come across as being malicious.The plot is excellent. It manages to pack in so much fun, action and horror in just two hours. The plot twists are very unpredictable, and every twist leads to yet another adventure. Who would have thought a comedy would have full scale shootouts in a supermarkets and high speed car chases? 'Hot Fuzz' also contains gore for the horror fans. These scenes are graphic, but appear almost comical. Maybe these scenes are comical, but I think it is more because of the whole hilarious atmosphere of the film that makes everything look entertaining. I truly enjoyed 'Hot Fuzz', I can safely declare that this is a masterpiece of the comedy genre.",Null,1,2,6 October 2008

","This film is about a mother trying to bring up two young children with photo-sensitivity after the Second World War. Sinister things happen in her house that makes them question their sanity.'The Others' has a good script. The ending twist is sudden and unexpected, it would have been so original if it was released before 'The Sixth Sense'. As for the delivery of the plot, there is just enough thrill and suspense to keep me interested, but not enough to keep me on edge. I find most of the film quite depressing and dull due to the lack of light and sound in the film. Imagine the lives of the children, living in darkness, loneliness and fear must have been tough and traumatising. It would have been great if the plot could have touched more on that.",Null,0,3,14 May 2010

However, 'Rise of the Guardians' does not have any elements to entertain adults. I found the plot very boring and childish. The main characters don't look nice or cuddly, in fact the Santa Claus and the Easte bunny look unwelcoming! The plot's central idea is to make children believe, and I found it so hard to get into the film as the central plot is based on something not true. The plot drags on without jokes or emotional climax. I was thoroughly bored by 'Rise of the Guardians'.",Null,1,5,14 April 2013
Just Go with It," The best romantic comedy in years
","This film is about a plastic surgeon who lies about being almost divorced in order to hook up with women. He faces a difficult situation when he is asked to live this lie, which rolls increasingly bigger.Many romantic comedies focus on romance and hence is not so funny, but 'Just Go With It' is seriously funny and romantic at the same time. There is amazing connection between Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, which is critical for the film's success. There are so many funny scenes, I laughed so hard at a few of them, such as Palmer being pushed into the pool and the coconut scene. Nicole Kidman has a small but memorable role, which sees her in situations (involving the coconut as well) which I would not have imagined a mega star to agree to filming. Together with the great Hawaiian scenery, lighthearted atmosphere and sweet romance, 'Just Go With It' is the best romantic comedy in years.",Null,4,9,15 April 2011

Jake Gyllenhaal's soft side and Heath Ledger's rough side were displayed in the film. The shock of Michelle Williams when she saw the two guys making out was very memorable. The ending was so touching. If you don't know what was happening, then you should read the book. The book gives you a clearer idea of what happened in the end.The cinematography was also excellent. The scenery itself was very impressive too. I felt I was watching the National Geographic! I found that this film was not just a 'gay' film, but it also explored the issues of homosexuality as a social taboo, and how homosexuals live under pressure imposed by the society and by themselves as a result of the societal pressure.

I am also impressed by his endless enthusiasm. Despite his repeated spectacular failures, he is unrelenting and make movie after another.I am impressed by Johnny Depp's portrayal as Ed Wood.

I felt so disturbed after watching 70 minutes that I could not watch it anymore. The plot may be simple, but the delivery of it is definitely hauntingly effective. It leaves me unsettled and deeply disturbed. I also feel unhappy as the story may put people off adoption, hence robbing innocent and needy children's chance of having a loving family. In short, I wish I could undo watching even just the 70 minutes I watched, because it disturbed me too much.",Null,2,3,20 December 2009

","This film tells the story of a young man who is able to travel back in time. He embarks on the mission to make his life perfect by finding a girlfriend.Though the main character is a guy, it still is a romantic film that is aimed at women. The story is about finding happiness, and what you would give up for happiness caused by a certain outcome. It's almost like 'The Notebook' plus 'The Time Traveler's Wife' combined, and as Rachel Mcadams is in all three, there's much danger of her being typecast. Or cast only Rachel in time travelling films or don't make the film! Back to the film itself, I think it's a story about an ordinary guy with extraordinary abilities. His realisation at the end is quite good, and it wasn't the ending I was expecting. Though there are many plot holes, just like many other time travel stories, it's still an enjoyable film.",Null,2,3,2 April 2014

It engrossed my attention from the first minute right up to the very last. It repeatedly made my eyes tear up, as each monstrosity that unfolds is bigger than the previous one. When Rachel McAdam's character interviews the priest on his front door, I found myself holding my breath in shock, synchronous with the reaction of McAdam's character.

Zooey Deschanel has vastly improved in her variety of facial expressions displayed, but still she looks like a cardboard cut out that tries too hard to be cute and fresh. The story is boring, plain and not engaging. The way that the story is delivered is unconventional, but it is not as groundbreaking as people think. Fortunately, Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a good performance, so it saves the film from being unwatchable. I find '(500) Days of Summer' very overrated.",Null,32,53,6 December 2009

Despite the fun and humour, it is still thought provoking and captivating.The dialog is superb, there are so many memorable lines that deserve mention.

The second Pirates of the Caribbean movie was entertaining and fun, and yet this one drags on and on. The storyline is very confusing and is often incoherent. One minute they are in an ocean of ice and another minute they are in the desert. It is not helped by the flood of minor characters present, and most of them are dispensible and appear for a few minutes just to take up screen time. Calypso's accent is ever so hard to understand, and I barely understood a thing she said. The jokes are not funny, and there is hardly anything entertaining with the film.

The plot is so repetitive that my friends and I lost interested half way already. It's always the same scene and the same facial expression. It's always Jon having an orgasmic face and Barbara having a plastic face, acting very urban hip hop style. I thought the film would be edgy and sexy, but it's not. It turned out to be so boring.

The scene where a taxi was suspended in mid-air is thrilling and keeps me on the edge.I really liked the plot of this movie. The hilarious and yet emotional scene in the restaurant involving champagne is so entertaining! On the surface, it is a superhero story, with loads of people cheering for him on the streets. It also has elements of love, courage, friendship and loyalty. It is hard to blend all these ideas into one, and in this case they did it so well. The ending is so touching!

","This film tells the story of the God of Thunder, who is trapped on a waste planet and has to win a tournament in order to gain back his freedom. In the meantime, he has to race against time to stop an evil force destroying Asgard.Perhaps inspired by the success of 'Deadpool', 'Thor: Ragnarok' has comedic elements beefed way up. It gets to a point where I think there is too much comedy and not enough heroic demeanor. Fortunately, the balance of comedy and heroic action is successfully struck by the middle of the film. The jokes in the second half of the film induces giggles, but do not distract viewers from the story. The story is intense and the visuals are great. Cate Blanchett is stylish and yet chill inducing in her new look and feel that I have not seen in any of her previous film. I feel a little sad about what happens to the main character, and I wish it did not turn out that way. I enjoyed watching it, even though I wish the superhero elements is emphasised more.",Null,37,66,26 October 2017
Match Point," Gripping film after a slow start
","I watched this film and I liked it a lot! The film first started off very slow, as there are many characters to introduce. They also had to put in that tennis scene to pave the way for later developments. After we got to know all the characters, their love relationships get rather muddled up. Jonathan Rhys Meyers & Scarlett Johansson were very good in their roles, it was so convincing that they really loved each other. The locations were very well chosen.As the story unfolds, it became very gripping and kept me in suspense. Who would have thought the lovely Jonathan Rhys Meyers would have done such a thing? The ending was a bit unexpected, but I loved it.After the disastrous Melinda And Melinda, Woody Allen made a wonderful film to redeem himself. Though I still miss his witty comedies such as Hollywood Ending or Small Time Crooks.",Null,1,2,20 May 2006
Children of Heaven," Wonderfully heartwarming
","Wow, what can I say? Every bit of this film is so warm! It really looked at the world from a child's perspective. Every single scene is inundated with sweetness and the innocence of children. How they share one pair of shoes was amazing...and heartbreaking. How the little sister had no confidence in her brothers shoes was shown in such a warm and effective way. The ultimate despair Ali felt when he won was also so heartbreaking. Ali and his sister are both so cute and they can really act. This film can easily move one to tears. Do watch it!",Null,63,67,9 March 2003
Yes Man," A positive comedy
","This film is about a man who embraces a dramatic change in life by saying yes to every opportunity.I enjoyed watching 'Yes Man'. It is refreshing to finally see that Jim Carrey, makes people laugh without the copious help of silly faces. I find the plot funny and well executed! Many scenes are laugh out loud funny, especially the first preaching conference. The constant affirmation in the film creates a positive vibe, which is important for a comedy. There are a lot of feel good elements in the plot, which lifts and engages viewers. Though I did notice the product placements, I think they are acceptable as they are not out of place with the plot.",Null,0,0,3 April 2009
Midnight in Paris," A fun, and heartwarming fantasy tale
","This film is about an American writer who travels to Paris with his fiancée. A chance encounter at midnight brings him back to the Paris in the 1920's.'Midnight in Paris' is very unlike a Woody Allen film, as it lacks the non stop witty dialogs and sarcasm that are normally his trademarks. Still, 'Midnight in Paris' is highly intellectual and enjoyable. The way it entertainingly weaves through so many artistic masterminds in a story is quite genius. It gives me the impulse to go and study art history! The cast is magnetic; Owen Wilson breathes life into this confused man, while Adrien Brody is particularly memorable as Salvador Dali. Even Carla Bruni is in the film, which is almost a official recognition by the French that 'Midnight in Paris' is a great film.'Midnight in Paris' might be the most commercial film Woody Allen has made in years. It is a fun, and heartwarming fantasy tale. I am glad that this has translated to box office success.",Null,4,6,28 September 2011
The Last Song," Can't decide what it wants to be
","This film tells the story of a teenage girl and her brother, who are forced to spend the summer with their father in a southern seaside town. She meets a charming guy and falls for him, but unfortunately life gets in the way.'The Last Song' is quite a weak Nicholas Sparks story because it cannot decide what it wants to be. Is it a romantic story between two teenagers, or a drama about an estranged father and daughter relationship? The first half is the former while the second half is the latter. The film appears to be a forced hybrid between the two, and is not helped by the constantly grumpy Miley Cyrus. She and Liam Hemsworth don't even look right together for this film. Fortunately Greg Kinnear is very good as the father who has a secret he can't tell anyone, which saves the film a bit.",Null,5,7,25 August 2015

They meet various people and reflect on their current lives.'Youth' is visually very beautiful. The scenery is beautiful, the resort is beautiful and the sets are beautiful. Every scene is well thought out and beautifully composed. However, that's really the only good thing about it. There is not much of a story present, only characters mumbling away through the film. The four other people I went to the cinema with had no idea what the story was about. There is no central message, no plot to unfold and nothing to engage the viewers.

","This film recounts the serial murder by a mysterious murder who called himself Zodiac.There is so much suspense in the film that keeps me on the edge all the time. I am impressed by Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of the insistent cartoonist, Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of a lost alcoholic. The characters in the film are developed so well that we get to care about all of them, even though they may have only a few minutes of screen time. An example is the woman with the baby who escaped from Zodiac. She is in the film for only a few minutes, but her scenes create pivotal suspense in the film. This film maintains the suspense throughout its length, which is in itself an achievement!",Null,1,2,26 June 2007
Milk," A powerful and engaging film
","This film is about the activist Harvey Milk, who stirred up a gay rights movement in the conservative America back in 1970's.'Milk' is an engaging film about Harvey Milk. The characters are all very well portrayed, especially Harvey Milk and Scott Smith. They are real human beings that connect to the viewers. Every time a character does something, I look forward to seeing them succeed. This does not happen very much for me, which shows how well the characters are sculpted and how engaging they are.Sean Penn's acting is amazing. The ease he displayed when he kisses several other actors is also remarkable. Scott Smith has a special mysterious charm, that I somehow long for him to be back with Harvey Milk.Despite the ending is already shown right at the beginning of the film, it strangely does not spoil the film, but in fact enhances interest in the film. It makes me want to find out why such an ending occurs. As for the real ending, it is powerful and tear jerking. 'Milk' is a well made film that engages viewers throughout.",Null,4,8,13 December 2008
The Prestige," Outstandingly good film

Indeed, the film has not disappointed me. This is the best film I have seen in a long time! First of all, the plot is excellent. A story about magic is in itself intriguing. Coupled with a lot of very unexpected and unimaginable and yet realistic twists, this film leaves you surprised until the very end. There are many chilling moments, and many moments where the viewers are made to fidget in their seat because of immense suspense. When everything was unveiled and demystified in the end, I was in astonishment of the outstanding quality of the film.The character development is excellent. The viewers can all understand the cause of the rivalry, and we can all relate and sympathise with he characters.Acting is great. The set designs are visually attractive and nostalgic, and it can easily be seen that a lot of effort has been put into this.",Null,6,10,15 November 2006
Cloverfield," Amazing special effects, but don't watch it if you are prone to motion sickness!
","This is a video chronicle of a group of young people's escape from Manhattan, where a monster roams the streets, destroying everything in between.The film is intense. The visual effects are stunning, and the realism of the attacks is phenomenal. Buildings collapse, cars get burnt and rocks fall from the sky. These scenes send chills down my spine, and will surely evoke traumatic memories in people who has been through disasters. Things happen quickly, and there is hardly the time to breathe. The plot is rather weak, posing a lot of unanswered questions, but it is made up for the pacing and the action. The only thing I have to complain is that the constant motion from the hand-held camera made me sick. If you are prone to motion sickness like I am, make sure you don't watch this film. Otherwise, you are in for an adventure!",Null,21,45,17 January 2008
Sleepy Hollow," An engaging film
","This film is about an inspector who is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations that are supposedly done by a headless horseman.In keeping with Tim Burton's style, 'Sleepy Hollow' is gloomy but visually rich. There are plenty of very disturbing scenes that will unnerve most people. The story has a veil of mystery and thrill which adds to the film's eerie attraction. Johnny Depp's scientific methods strikingly contrasts the film's predominant supernatural theme. 'Sleepy Hollow' is an engaging film that kept me wanting to find out what happens next. Though I find the romance between Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci is rather unconvincingly developed, it still does not keep me from enjoying 'Sleepy Hollow'.",Null,2,3,24 March 2010
Hotel Rwanda," Powerful, touching reflection of the good and bad of humanity
","This film is about a man who helped over 1000 people to escape genocide in Rwanda in early 1990's.This film serves as a mirror in which everyone can reflect upon. As the film rightly stated, where were we when the people were in need? When we see these terrible images, we say that's sad and then we continue our happy lives. This is sad, and even shocking, but true.The plot is touching, especially the fact that Rusesabagina tried every way possible to save the innocent lives. He risked his own live to save complete strangers. Despair after despair, he did not give up hope.Due to the tight editing, we got to see a lot of horrifying scenes in the space of 2 hours. However, I am sure the situation was much worse than portrayed in the film, as in the film the violence was shown in a restrained manner.Though in the film we get a happy ending of the main characters, we must not forget that most of the millions who suffered did not have such fortune. The lives of the millions died, and many more millions who survived to suffer should be remembered, not just the hero who rightly deserved his glory.",Null,0,0,27 March 2007
Ready Player One," A visual adventure in a digital land

The story is fast paced, but still easy to follow. I like the fact that it links virtuality and reality, and reminds people not to lose sight of the real world. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,1,2,8 April 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," One big confusion
","This film is about the British secret service trying to find a mole among the top ranking intelligence officers.'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is such a confusing film. There are so many characters, and they are not introduced at all. Even if they were introduced, they are all in codes. I got all the characters all jumbled up, and could not understand the story. What makes it even more complicated is the constant jumping from present to flashbacks, and there is little way to tell which is which. And almost everything is spoken in riddles.Though I can see how 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is gripping and engaging, I just could not follow what was going on.",Null,2,5,9 January 2012

The pace is slow at times, but it helps to deliver the various twists and turns of the plot clearly. I also liked the fact that characters think aloud at times to explain the plot. As usual, the violence and gore is very graphic, to the point that it is over the top funny. Though 'The Hateful Eight' did not keep me on edge or made me hold my breath, I did not feel that it was three hours long.",Null,1,8,12 January 2016

Dear John," An engaging romantic drama

Underneath the helplessness and sadness imposed upon the lovers by distance and inaccessibility, 'Dear John' is such a sweet film. Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum deliver adequate performances, but it is Richard Jenkins who shines in the film. He plays an autistic individual who has an intense interest in coin collection. His reserved personality and awkwardness towards interpersonal communication are portrayed very well.'Dear John' is an engaging drama. It is very romantic, and I imagine it will become a must see for young couples in the future.",Null,0,1,4 May 2010

It is literally packed with adventures, on land, in the air and in the sea. One moment off the screen, an you will miss something exciting or vital to the story.It is visually rich and colourful, the soft colours make it look so pleasing. The animation is very realistic that I could hardly believe it is an animation. Many of these scenes look great in 2D, and I can imagine it being spectacular on a 3D screen.

","This film tells the story of a daughter of a Polynesian chief, who is fascinated by the ocean. However, the chief forbids anyone sail past the reefs, even when fishing is no longer possible in their island waters.There are funny moments in 'Moana', such as the scene when her hair slaps onto her face, and the comment about her giving the sky a high five. The coconuts are funny as well, and I think the fight with coconuts is the best part of the film. The crab, however, is the worst part of the film. I can't quite stand the songs of the crab, and the glittery effect of his shell somehow just doesn't seem right. The final monster made of lava looks quite scary, I think it could be too scary for children. Overall, I think it is a passable film, but I don't really like the songs in the film.",Null,1,5,7 February 2017
Crash," A crash of ideas and values
","This film is about 7 groups of individuals whose lives intersect on a certain day due to two car crashes.This film tried to examine the issue of racism, racial stereotypes and power. It also looked at good and evil; sometimes even the best person can be evil and other times the bad person can act gracefully. In this aspect, the film succeeded.However, I found the first half of the film too extreme. To see Ludicrous' character putting every single thing in his daily life to the product of racism was far too much. I worried that, instead of making people beware of racism, it was spreading racism and radical ideas.The plot of interwoven story was not undone before. The way that the characters interconnected was obvious and required little brain work. In this aspect, I preferred another film 11:14 starring Hilary Swank which was interwoven much more cleverly.",Null,1,3,23 August 2006

Soon, he appears to be out of his depth.'Spider-Man: Homecoming' reminds me of 'Deadpool' because of its light hearted atmosphere, and Peter's mischievous demeanour. The fact that Peter is in observation and training provides a good background to the mischief, otherwise I think it might have proved to be a little annoying. Spiderman is not the almighty hero, but someone who has the potential to be. It is nice to see a cameo from Captain America, and it creates a seamless transition for Spiderman from a standalone franchise to integrating into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Null,3,6,24 July 2017

","This film tells the story of a gang of notorious criminals, who is asked by a government agent to track down and take down a dangerous criminal. The leader of the gang, Dominic Toretto, faces unexpected obstacles as this mission involves his missing girlfriend.It is amazing how every 'The Fast and the Furious' films outdo itself. I thought the fifth one is pretty amazing, but 'Fast and Furious 6' just outshines the previous ones again. The action sequences here are simple jaw dropping. The sky is the limit when it comes to action scenes. You think you have seen the most daredevil scenes? They push the limit even more just a few minutes later. I thought the really intense central London car chase scene was the climactic finale, but the film didn't end. There was still 30 minutes to go because the real finale involves many cars, a plane and many fights. The whole airplane scene is simply beyond my imagination. It is so good. Now that I have finally watched all 1-7 films, I am anticipating the 8th one.",Null,1,2,26 March 2017
The Expendables," On par with anyone's expectations
","This film is about a bunch of professional assassins hired to kill the leader of an island nation.'The Expendables' has a very simple plot, it's so simple that it almost requires no dialog. As there is almost no dialog, screen time is filled by one fight after another. It seems that there is a fight in every scene, and there needs no reason for a fight. The action is packed, exciting and pumps adrenaline throughout the film. Yet, some violent scenes are excessively gory and unrealistic in a cartoon style, which undermines the credibility of the action. I think 'The Expendables' delivers entertainment to action fans, which is what anyone can expect from these action stars.",Null,1,6,7 October 2010

","This film is about a woman having a premonition about a highway accident. She successfully avoids death, but things are not as smooth as it seems just yet.'Final Destination 2' has to set itself as different than 'Final Destination' , so it has a more complicated plot. They get credit for trying, but the plot is is a lot harder to follow. And it makes viewers use their brains to figure out whether a scene fits into a story or is a plot hole. This is not a brainless entertainment as the first one was. Another credit they get is that this time round, the characters do not die when you think they die, but in a more surprising moment.

Knocked Up," Over-hyped
","This film is about a successful TV presenter who gets pregnant after a drunken one night stand.'Knocked Up' tells a story that a lot of people fear, and a lot of people can relate to. The two individuals in the spotlight are very incompatible with each other, and yet they try to be in a relationship for the sake of the unborn baby. The film s funny at times, but most of the time the five pot heads are far too annoying to be entertaining. Watching them acting irresponsibly like spoiled teenagers is not my idea of comedy.I cannot help compare 'Knocked Up' with 'This Is 40', which is the sequel of this. I found 'This Is 40' funny but fragmented; 'Knocked Up' is cohesive but not so funny. I think it is over-hyped. If it wasn't for Katherine Heigl's charm and Leslie Mann's attitude, 'Knocked Up' would have been a bore.",Null,1,2,13 August 2013

Their chance encounter in a bar sparks the start of a journey that helps both of them to get back on their feet.The plot is a positive one, as everyone gets something positive out of the bad night they initially had. Mark Ruffalo gets back into the music industry, Keira Knightley gets to make an album, even the wife and the daughter of Mark Ruffalo gets a great outcome out of the experience. I like the songs in the film, but I get the feeling that there are really too much singing scenes. It was as if I was watching an extended music video.

The plot continues to be emotionally complex throughout the whole plot, as he struggles with the lost of identity after the death of the superhero. 'Megamind' is probably the most emotionally complex animation I have seen.There are also much for kids to enjoy. The film is exciting, with lots of superhero action and fighting.

There's still much humanity around, such as the burgmeister's wife letting Liesel into her library for reading. On a citizen level, life goes on.The plot is a bit slow in the first hour, then all of a sudden it speeds up and many tragedies strike. I would have liked it even more if the pace was more balanced throughout the film.",Null,2,3,30 March 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Engaging and powerful
","This film is about a barber seeking revenge against a judge who destroyed his family and snatched his daughter away.Unlike the recent Tim Burton films, 'Sweeny Todd' is not as visually dazzling as it does not feature the whole spectrum of colours. That's not to say the visuals are not good, in fact the gory scenes are brutally scary that makes me squirm. It makes up by having lots of melodic songs and expertly written lyrics. The plot is tight and gripping, and I am immersed in the story throughout. The ending is a little surprising, and it certainly is not a Hollywood ending. I find the film engaging and powerful, and it makes me scared to know such a psychopathic person could exist.",Null,0,2,3 February 2008
Blades of Glory," Great family entertainment
","This film is about the unlikely partnership of two ice skating rivals in the world championship of double figure skating.The idea of fusing modern moves, such as hip hop, robot dance and even resuscitation into ice skating is really good. It works well because these are new ideas, and they provide visually dynamic scenes. The costumes are also interesting, and the most memorable one is of course the skate rockets. The initial rivalry between Chazz and Jimmy is built well, and the subsequent partnership is also strong. The jokes are good, and the ice skating moves have to be seen to be believed. Will Ferrell and Jon Heder both did a great job as skaters. It's a fun film to watch!",Null,0,1,20 August 2007
Horrible Bosses," A dark comedy
","This film is about three people whose bosses are horrible. They come up with the ultimate revenge plan by conspiring to murder their bosses.For a change, 'Horrible Bosses' is a comedy that requires actors to act in the film. Jennifer Aniston departs from her usual romantic comedy role to become a nymphomaniac, while Colin Farrell is beyond recognition as a drug addict. These two characters are particularly interesting, and it would have been ideal if they were given even more screen time. Some jokes work by irony and some are rude, but they all work. Even if they don't make you laugh out loud, it certainly will make you smile. 'Horrible Bosses' is a dark comedy that is worth watching.",Null,1,3,23 September 2011

After I get the story, it is captivating because of the moral decisions of the characters in the story. It is captivating to see Jimmy Bulger getting increasing distrusting, killing everyone who he suspects might be in his way. The fact that John Connolly blurring what is right and wrong, and forgetting where his loyalty lies is also very captivating. I find the film rather violent, and it made me jump quite a few times.

So many action thriller nowadays involve mindless violence and senseless explosions, but 'The Town' has none of these problems. It has well developed emotional elements in the background of action. The relationship between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall is well portrayed and developed. It is interesting to see how their relationship is tested when the truth comes out, and it is satisfying to see how their relationship end up to be in the end.I find the middle parts of the film a little slow, but the ending parts make up for it.

After watching it, I can see why there is so much buzz. The characters are properly introduced in depth at the beginning, so I get to know who they are and have a glimpse of how they have come to be. After the introduction, the plot is tight and engaging. It is very cool to watch all the villains doing a super job, blurring the lines between villains and heroes.

It gives many ambiguous clues which could support Teddy's side or the doctor's side. Normally I dislike ambiguous story lines but in 'Shutter Island' it gives me room to think which side to believe. Story telling is excellent, as it keeps me crave for the story to develop.'Shutter Island' is a long film but I say it is too short.

This time round, there is a great plot that cuts to the chase right from the start. It spends no time fluffing around, and there is action and adventure all the way through. Many scenes left me astounded, such as the extended battle scene involving Fury and the police cars, and the scene involving disaster on the 41st floor. The special effects are very impressive, but the 3D is very underwhelming. Most of the time I don't even notice the 3D.Overall, I enjoyed 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' a lot.

He bonds with a murderer during the visits in prison.The most striking feature about this film is the acting of Philip Seymour Hoffman. He completely transforms himself into a completely different person. His distinctively high speaking tone and a camp persona must have been the result of a lengthy and hard process of practice. The plot is somewhat predictable, a little slow in the beginning but picks up towards the end. The scene where Truman Capote has to tell Perry that he is in fact a friend with a motivation is memorable. Everything in this scene is excellent, from the acting, direction and lighting, they all fit the mood of the scene.

His constant battles to survive is engagingly presented, as each challenge is so real. It's amazing how desperate situations can bring another side out of us. As the plot continues, something feels not so right, until the twist comes that everything makes sense again. This twist serves not only to surprise and entertain, but adds a whole new dimension to ponder upon. The struggles presented initially all pales in comparison. It's intensely moving.

One day, the tiny world she knows is turned upside down when an intruder enters her tower.I knew 'Tangled' would be sweet and happy as it is a Disney film, but still it surpassed all my saccharine expectations. The characters are so adorable, even the minor supporting characters such as the clever chameleon and dog-like horse. Some of the plot is delivered by songs, which adds to the merry atmosphere. There are so many really funny jokes for all ages, basically the whole film made us laugh hard! 'Tangled' is a great animation, with a sweet story and is very entertaining.",Null,7,10,20 January 2011
Doctor Strange," Marvel has outdone themselves again
","This film tells the story of a highly skilled, but also highly arrogant neurosurgeon who is severely injured in a car accident. He goes to the East to seek a guru who can heal the most severe injuries miraculously. After his arrival, he gets way more than he asked for.I can honestly say, Marvel Studio has outdone themselves again. The computer graphics are spectacular. The scene in the trailer where New York City folds up and inverts itself already gets me fascinated, the extended treatment in the film simply makes me hold my breath literally because it is so amazing. The mirror dimension is just very cool, and basically everything visually is cool in the film.The story is fast paced and engaging. The characters are likable, even Dr Strange in his former life. Tilda Swinton has this calming and regal quality in this role, that makes her very convincing as the Ancient One. I really enjoyed it.And don't miss the two post credit scenes!",Null,5,14,27 October 2016
Interstellar," Emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging
","This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.'Interstellar' is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed 'Interstellar' thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.",Null,5,10,6 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A very powerful film
","This film tells the story of a woman who rents three billboards in her town in order to challenge the local police to solve the murder of her daughter.Wow, this story is very intense. It is not just the subject matter that challenges the viewers, but also the action of the mother as well. It is understandable that she does what she does in the film, but somehow I get the sense of her being ruthless and almost cold blooded for some of the actions she does. Each action leads to a consequence, and the consequence leads to yet another consequence. It is almost heartbreaking to see the ripple effect of her initial action, and how it affects an increasing number of people in town in increasingly drastic ways. This story is breathtaking, and the story telling is breath taking. It is very powerful, and I would recommend it to my friends.",Null,2,6,29 December 2017
Pacific Rim," Neural connection did not work!
","This film is about the special forces of human controlled robot fighters who fight against giant sea creatures.At first I liked 'Pacific Rim', but as the film progressed I found it boring, then I found it unbearably bad. First, the film is dark all the time, with grayish tint throughout. I got so tired of the monochromatic stimulation. More colour could easily be provided, such as changing the colour of the wall in the base camp. Second, the plot is just not engaging or exciting. There were several occasions when I thought the film was ending, but it continued. And dragged on. The film just did not know when to stop. The plot does not build up to an effective climax either. That motivational speech by Idris Elba ended up being laughable.Another thing that really killed my enjoyment was the bunker scene in Hong Kong. Despite the film being set in the 2020's, people in the bunker wore clothes in the 1920s. And they even spoke in Mandarin, which is not spoken in Hong Kong. The director sacrificed such important factual errors for cinematic clichés. And while I am on clichés, the first scene with Chinese people in the Hong Kong base shows the people from China playing basketball. My eyes rolled so much when I saw that scene! I wish I did not waste time on this film. The neural connection certainly did not work for me.",Null,2,10,4 August 2013
American Sniper," Good but I expected more
","This film tells the story of the event wars, told through the experiences of an outstanding sniper in the elite Seal unit of USA.I find 'American Sniper' quite a departure from Clint Eastwood's recent films. Usually his films tell an emotional story that drives people to tears, touching the heart and soul like he often excels in doing. Instead, in this film he focuses on the bloody combats in the warzone. The emotional subplot is only minor, as if they are filler scenes between the intense combat scenes. The result is that the emotional side of the film is much underdeveloped, and even rushed and inadequately expressed especially after Chris congress back from the fourth tour.As a war thriller, 'American Sniper' is good. I expected more of Clint Eastwood though.",Null,1,18,16 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," I can't wait to watch it again!
","This film is about a young graduate (Anne Hathaway) who stumbles across a job as the assistant to the Chief Editor of a prominent fashion magazine. After the poor start with her boss, played by Meryl Streep, Hathaway learns to reinvent herself and climb higher and higher up the ladder, and in the process alienates herself from her past, family and friends.Meryl Streep is great as usual. She gives a fine performance as a very confident and powerful businesswoman. There is a scene in which she is weak and vulnerable, and she also handles that well.Stanley Tucci is also great. He plays a camp man who is very important in the magazine. His campness is so natural that for a while I thought he was gay! Anne Hathaway is lovable and adorable. It is amazing how she shot to stardom in just a few movies, and I can see why! The script is great, the dialog is witty, and the movie is fast paced and never leaves you bored. The soundtrack is upbeat and relevant, and even appropriately including the material girl Madonna's recent song! The make up is amazing as well. After seeing Meryl Streep looking very dejected and vulnerable in one scene, she becomes strong and confident again. I can't help but notice that apart from acting skills, the make up department helps a lot in this transition too.I laughed out so many times during the movie as there were so many subtle jokes. It does not rely on any toilet humour or obscenities to make viewers laugh, which is very refreshing to have.I definitely recommend this film, and I can't wait to watch it again!",Null,1,2,22 September 2006
Lion," An emotional journey
","This film tells the remarkable story of a young Indian boy who is lost because he got on an empty train that travelled for days. He has no idea where he is from, where he is at or how to get home. He is adopted by an Australian family subsequently, but he has not forgotten where he is truly from.I remember reading about this news story years ago, about a man who found his home using Google map. Just imagining what his journey could be like is already touching me to tears. Watching his journey makes my imagined scenario real, and touches me deeply. It must have been very terrifying for a five year old boy to go through such an ordeal. The film conveys the ordeal brilliantly. His time at the orphanage isn't that much better, though it is not because of anyone's malicious intent. The scene when Saroo asks whether the orphanage has tried to search for his mother is touching, and there are lots more touching degrees to come. It is a great emotional journey.",Null,1,2,14 February 2017
Romeo + Juliet," Innovative
","I think this film is very innovative. The director took a whole new approach to film the Shakespeare's classic. Instead of purely making the words visual, the film reinvents the story. The story is set in modern times, you see cars, guns, helicopters, ambulance, express courier services etc. Apart from the obligatory electronic music, you even get altar boys singing hard rock! Romeo & Juliet experience is taken to new heights. I never noticed the female lead, Claire Danes. She is so adorable! I wonder why is she not in more films. I definitely recommend this film!",Null,0,1,11 June 2003
Gone Baby Gone," Strong and engaging story of difficult moral choices
","This is a film about two private detectives investigating a case of missing child. No one is prepared for the avalanche of shocking events that unfolds during the investigation.The first half of 'Gone Baby Gone' is a thriller about the search for a missing girl, while the second half is an emotional drama about the search for truth and moral dilemmas. The great thing about 'Gone Baby Gone' is that such transition is gradual, without being contrived as it easily could have been. The plot is very strong and engaging. It questions who is fit to be a parent, who is to decide who is fit, and who is to decide a child's future. It's a heavy subject that people will feel strongly about, but 'Gone Baby Gone' manages to present the issue in a balanced way.For years Casey Affleck is known to me as Ben's brother. After watching 'Gone Baby Gone' and 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford', I am impressed and am convinced that he is a serious and talented actor. As for Ben Affleck, his directorial debut is impressive, and I am already looking forward to more of his work.",Null,1,2,1 April 2008
The Lost City of Z," A great character
","This film tells the story of a soldier who carries a bad family name. In order to clear his father's name, he accepts an impossible mission of exploring Bolivia and make a map of the unknown territory. His adventures are widely ridiculed back in the UK, but he is determined to find the lost city that he believes to exist in the wild Amazon.'The Lost City of Z' is a slow film but it engages me throughout. His adventures are well portrayed, providing intense fights for survival. There are also scenes of his inner struggle between his family and his mission, and the resolution between Percy and Jack is heart warming. I find Percy courageous and determined, which are great character traits. His handling of Mr Murray in the Royal Geographical Society is very satisfying too. I enjoyed 'The Lost City of Z'.",Null,1,2,3 August 2017
Southpaw," A film for boxing fan
","This film tells the story of a champion boxer who has anger management issues. He has to confront himself when his wife is tragically killed in a violent incident.'Southpaw' is a poignant tale of a man trying to stand up after an epic fall. Though it has a touching story, I am unable to get into the story most of the time. I have trouble understanding how Billy Hope becomes a champion boxer when his basic techniques are lacking and needed training from Wills. However, the film is beautifully shot, and the acting is great. 'Southpaw' has a lot of brutal boxing scenes, and quite many times I find myself unable to watch it because of its bloodiness and shocking violence. I guess one would have to be a boxing fan in order to enjoy 'Southpaw'.",Null,0,0,28 September 2015
Ant-Man," A surprisingly good superhero film
","This film tells the story of a criminal with a masters degree in electronic engineering who tries to take the right path for the sake of his daughter. Through strange twists of fate, he becomes an unlikely superhero called the Ant-Man.The many posters for 'Ant-Man' only emphasises the diminutive size of the new superhero in the Marvel collection, but to me they do not entice me to watch the film. After watching 'Ant-Man' though, I was completely blown away.'Ant-Man' has a long build up because it is introducing an entirely new superhero. The build up is good, and characters all have distinctive personalities to make them different and interesting. I was captivated by the plot. It has so much action going on both action-wise and emotionally and I am still spell bound despite having left the cinema and arrived home. I really like the fact that there are two emotional subplots, one involving Paul Rudd and his daughter, and the other one between Michael Douglas and his daughter.Ant-Man is an unlikely superhero film, because ants are not usually adored by people. To turn it into a great superhero film is quite an achievement. I really enjoyed watching 'Ant-Man'.",Null,2,11,16 July 2015

They are mischievous but likable, and most importantly not annoying. There are loads of funny jokes in the film, it keeps making you laugh the whole time.

He is selected for a special program to transform him into a superhero that will save the United States of America.'Captain America The First Avenger' is quite unlike other superhero blockbusters. It starts off slow, detailing how he was bullied on the streets of Brooklyn and then in the Army training base. He is finally transformed into a superhero after one hour of screen time, which is pretty long and slow if you ask me. Then, the plot is rather unfocused, as it tells the fight between USA and Nazi Germany, and also the fight between Rogers and the bad red guy. I find the plot so unfocused that I lost interest in it altogether. It is not packed with action enough, not packed with enough thrills or excitement.

With David O. Russell hot on the heels of his Oscar winner 'Silver Linings Playbook', and the super stellar cast involved, one rightly has high expectations on it. The actors are charming in their roles, especially Amy Adams whose character is a smart woman who plays both sides of the game. Bradley Cooper's character is energetic and wild, and he is also an interesting character in the film. However, I find the plot rather uninteresting. It drags on too long, and there the events are not portrayed intense enough.

There are no unnecessary scenes, subplots or even dialogs. Everything exists for a reason. It is streamlined and yet it still lasts for two hours, meaning that it has so much action and thrill to offer. The hand held camera adds realism and a sense of urgency throughout the film, without making me nauseous like 'Cloverfield' did. The music score is excellent, it propels the tension and helps sustain the suspense. In addition, there are no contrived romance or soft porn sex scenes to help sell the film.

Rush," Highly captivating
","This film recounts the story of the rivalry between two formula one drivers in the 1970's.'Rush' is aptly titled as it is a film about speed, and the necessity to obtain glory in the shortest time. However, 'Rush' is more than a film about racing. While it does have a lot of scenes devoted to high speed driving in various racetracks around the world, it also spends a lot of time developing the characters. James Hunt and Niki Lauda are shown as real human beings, not just empty vessels for high speed chases. The rivalry drives them forward, and they have tremendous respect for each other. I detect an unspoken bond of brotherhood between them, even though they appear to be sworn enemies. This kind of relationship is not easy to forge, and also difficult to portray.The medical scene is disturbing, and I spent those few minutes covering parts of the screen. That is the turning point where the film gets and maintains to be emotional. Altogether, 'Rush' is an entertaining and emotional film. It is a highly captivating film about breaking your own limits, and how much risk you will take to obtain what you want.",Null,2,3,3 January 2014

Jake Gyllenhaal plays this psychopathic character perfectly, while Renee Russo has also got an almost morbid fascination with the so called his news footage, which supplements Jake's ill character.

A lot of famous stars are interviewed, all proclaiming how amazing Conner is. That itself is so funny! The events portrayed are just so funny! I'm particularly amused by Seal making fun of himself.

'Oblivion' boasts very good visual effects, and I'm mesmerised by the beautiful minimalist design of the outpost. The pool is so cool, it's beyond description!

It has got a great cast so watching them is already a pleasure. Characters are introduced and developed well, and I care about them. Out of all the characters, I like Ted (Richard Jenkins) the best because he is the most sympathetic. He did not know about the plot until right at the end, but got dragged into it with a rather sad result.

I finished watching the film anyway, but it didn't get any better.The entire dialogs and the supposed jokes are very retarded. The whole conversation about who parties and who doesn't is so childish. And that fall scene is silly and annoying. The plot is so pointless and poorly executed. The characters are so annoying and unsympathetic, but worse of all they are not funny.

In fact, it is so fast that it sacrifices the story telling. The main backbone of the story is there, but there's no cohesion, engagement and no captivation. The plethora of characters also mean that each of them get little screen time, hence there's little developer of characters. I thought I was just being fed some fragmented scenes. The socially awkward young guy tries too hard to provide comedic relief, that it makes the heroic efforts of the league less credible.

Firstly the visual effects are really amazing. Almost every scene is made up of splendid computer effects. The extra terrestrial futuristic battles in the beginning is already spectacular, but it only gets better. Later in the film, the destruction of a metropolis on a never before seen scale and in such vivid detail, that I was completely entranced.It's easy for the abundance of special effects to drown out the plot, but fortunately that was not the case. The story spans a long time, with characters time to be developed and to make an impact on the viewers. I was drawn to Russell Crowe's integrity and his determination to save his planet, and I was impressed by Amy Adams' pursuit of the truth. Henry Cavill's superman is a very engaging character, he really shows the pain of growing up different. The human side of the plot is told very well, touching heart strings that ultimately make the emotional climax even more effective.After the film, I felt almost weak from exhaustion of adrenaline, and any other brain chemicals that the film had me firing. It's such a powerful film that never ceases to amaze and inspire awe.",Null,10,17,28 June 2013

An alien that is antisocial and destructive finds the idea of love appealing? Throughout the film, the characters do things that are not that socially acceptable. For example, in the initial part of the film, the girl locks herself in the house, and refuses to open the door for her sister. She does not open the door even when the sister gives an emotional plea. Another example is the unreasonable behaviour of the girl demanding the adoption of Stitch. In addition, the constantly destructive behaviour of Stitch is glamourised. What kind of message are we sending to kids? I am so disappointed with this film.

21," Adequate to kill time

Black Jack is a fast pace game, but the film does not give that pressing pressure during the game. I would also have liked to know why everyone in the team is in this business venture, but the film only explains why Ben is in. This would give the other members of the team more development and depth. In the film, Kianna and Choi are nothing more than mannequins that give signals one in a while. It's a pity that their characters are not explored.Though they explain the communication codes well, they have not explained the points system that is central to the whole plot. I was so lost about those +15 and +16's that it killed my enjoyment.It's also annoying that they keep going to the same casino, which causes their downfall.

After he witnessed his son being killed, he sets on a long journey to live for revenge.There is so much buzz around 'The Revenant' so I had high hopes for it. However, I was thoroughly disappointed after just ten minutes. It is excessively violent and graphically gory. I think there is no need for ten minutes of fighting and five minutes of bear attack, when one minute each is already enough to convey the message. Most scenes drag on and on, what could have been told in ten seconds are often dragged to minutes long.Another thing that I dislike is the fact that all actors have long unkempt hair, covering most of their faces. This makes character recognition an intense mental challenge! Thirdly, the story is not engaging or interesting. It only involves Leonardo walking around in snow most of the time. There is nothing to captivate me. I watched the whole 2.5 hours of 'The Revenant', and I was thoroughly bored.",Null,7,14,10 January 2016

The plot is very engaging, because there's always something dramatic going on. Gus and his daughter have an ambivalent relationship, and I'm so glad to see closure towards the end. The ending is very satisfying because of closure on several subplots. It delivers emotional elements and engages me a lot, especially the relationship between Gus and his daughter, the health of Gus and whether Gus can keep his job.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," An entertaining adventure
","This film is the adventure of Harry Potter, who is on the quest to find the Horcruxes of Lord Vordemont.I find the newest instalment of Harry Potter a little confusing, as I have only very vague recollections of what happened in previous books or films. The fast pace and the assumed knowledge of previous stories make it hard to follow at times. Putting that aside, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1' is entertaining as it is action packed and thrilling. The special effects are quite impressive too. There are so many moments that scared me out of my chair, with the sound effects successfully augmenting the scary visuals. I look forward to the next film, where they round up the whole series.",Null,0,0,16 December 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," A lacklustre sequel
","This film is about the Kung Fu Panda's journey to find who he really is, and along the way he saves China from evil forces.'Kung Fu Panda 2' tries to appeal to adults by be emotional elements, but this searching for roots business backfired. It is neither engaging nor entertaining. The is not much fun or adventure, and just having Jack Black repeating the word 'awesome' in its various grammatical forms does not make it awesome. We are not that easily brainwashed.'Kung Fu Panda 2' is a lacklustre sequel. It is way below my expectations. Judging from the ending, if there is a 'Kung Fu Panda 3' then it will not go in the direction I would like, so I hope this franchise stops here.",Null,3,6,3 July 2011
Little Miss Sunshine," Excellent acting and script
","This film is about a highly dysfunctional family's road trip to California in order for the youngest daughter to participate a beauty contest 'Little Miss Sunshine'.This film is very special, because it entirely relies on the script and the acting to keep the viewers interested. There are no special effects, no grand set designs or extravagant costumes. Acting by the whole cast is excellent. The script shows one dysfunctional argument after another. The arguments are interesting and non-superficial. The events that happen are bizarre and comical, such as the car breaking down and subsequent pushes for the car to start, or the removal of a dead body. These comical events are presented seriously, so it creates an interesting contrast between the events and the prevailing mood of the film. This film is very memorable!",Null,4,8,30 December 2006
Knowing," Great suspense, thrilling adventure
","This film is about a physicist uncovering a sheet of paper with mysterious number sequences. The numbers turn out to be accurate prophecies about Earthly calamities, 'Knowing' is a well made thriller. The story is well told, engrossing me and makes me want to find out what will happen. It creates and maintains suspense throughout. It also evokes discussion whether it is a good thing or not to know the future, especially when one dies. I certainly do not want to know mine. However, the ending is a little weak.Despite the fact that I do not usually like Nicholas Cage and his films, 'Knowing' is a surprisingly tight thriller.",Null,0,1,7 August 2009
Hugo," A visually appealing film but the pacing is too slow
","This film is about an orphan who tries to fix an automaton, hoping to find a secret message from his late father.'Hugo' is visually impressive. With its fairytale like backdrop, saturated colours and beautiful lighting, 'Hugo' looks so fantastic that it is almost too photo-shopped to be true.The story is far too slow, and not very engaging. The story contains a little fantasy, friendship and pieces of hopes and dreams. Yet, none of these elements are developed well enough to blossom into a beautiful subplot. Maybe it is because I felt bored by the slow pacing, I could not get into the worlds of Hugo or George. It would have been beautiful to see their traumatised worlds harmonise in even more scenes.",Null,2,6,23 February 2012
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," High energy animation the mixes things up
","This animation is full of energy and is very fast paced. I really like the colourful palette, and the fact that it really mixes things up. The animation combines 3D animation, Japanese anime elements and backgrounds that would probably have been 3D if viewed through 3D glasses. Combined with the split screens and texts on the screen, it really looks like a comic brought to life.",Null,3,9,24 December 2018
Over the Hedge," Imaginative and humorous, and there's something for everybody!
","This film is about an animal having to steal a lot of food to prevent getting killed by a bear. In the process, he made a lot of friends, learnt about family, trust and betrayal.I was very pleasantly surprised about this film. It was imaginative, fun and humorous to watch. It got me laughing out loud so many times. The jokes were funny and kids friendly too.It was also amazing how they gave seemingly everyday items and routines another light. A phone was rebranded as a device for summoning food, a door was called a portal for the entry of food. I never thought about it that way! The lateral thinking seen in this film was entertaining and fun.There were loads of intense action scenes to keep kid interested, and for adults, there were plots about family, trust and betrayal. There was something for everybody! I strongly recommend this film!",Null,0,1,29 August 2006
Wanted," Entertaining but not so memorable
","This film is about an accountant who gets selected to join a group of elite assassins.'Wanted' looks cool. I like the scenes where James McAvoy kills from a moving train, or from a flipped over car. And I was thrilled by the scene where a car smashes into the train. These actions scenes are rather new, and I was pleasantly surprised by them. However, the plot does not make so much sense. Bullets with curving trajectory is too surreal to be believed. In addition, the ending scene that involves many people being dead is plain ridiculous. Though I think 'Wanted' is entertaining, I cannot help but think that it is simply a vehicle for showcasing CGI effects and senseless violence.In summary, 'Wanted' is entertaining but not so memorable.",Null,0,2,4 October 2008

","This film tells the story of a high school physics teacher who is having financial troubles despite working multiple jobs. He turns back to his boxing days, and decides to enter a tournament with a prize of five million dollars.'Warrior' has a captivating story. It tells an man unlikely to stand a chance in a boxing tournament, climbing his way up the top. The emotional story is further augmented by the appearances of his estranged father and younger brother. The boxing scenes are intense, and wow, there is a whole hour of boxing scenes at the end, which is way more than other boxing films I've seen lately.",Null,1,2,23 April 2017
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Fogettable and unfunny
","This film is about the zoo animals trying to escape from Madagascar back to New York, only to find themselves in Africa.The jokes mainly comprise of the animals doing silly movements, and these are not funny. The plot is weak, and most of the screen time is occupied by animals dancing and singing. I understand the filmmakers are creating a festive atmosphere for Christmas release, but it is tiring and annoying to see hippos dancing, and then penguins dancing, and then zebra dancing, and then giraffes bouncing about.I am also very disturbed by the old lady who keeps hitting the animals. At one point, she incites other people to burn a lion alive. In another scene, a giraffe is talked into jumping into a volcano. This cruel acts to animals are unacceptable. 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' tries to make fun of these inhumane situations, which I find unacceptable. What kind of message are we sending to our children?'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' is a very forgettable film, and I was hugely disappointed by it. I was hoping it to be funny and entertaining, but it was not.",Null,4,12,23 December 2008
Dangal," A touching journey
","This film tells the story of a father who hopes to have sons to pass on his wrestling dreams. He suddenly realises that he can pass the dreams to his daughters, and begins to train his daughters to wrestle.It is particularly refreshing to see a film about equality and women's rights in a traditionally patriarchal society. The plot is obligatorily touching, and mixes humorous moments in it as well. The scene about the daughters forgetting the mother made me laugh. It is a remarkable journey of a dedicated father and his two daughters.",Null,1,1,26 December 2017
Salt," An action film with a good plot
","This film is about a CIA agent called Evelyn Salt, who gets accused of being a Russian spy by a Russian defector.Most action films exist only to showcase fights, weapons or car chase scenes; hence they have little or no plot. Even when they have a plot, they are laughable and makes no sense. 'Salt' however, is an exception as it has a good plot that makes sense. It reveals the story bit by bit, so that in different parts of the film you have a different view on Salt. This creates enough suspense and mystery to keep viewers interested. The pace is fast enough to keep the adrenaline going.'Salt' is a welcomed departure from the usual action films with mindless violence and senseless gore. Remember, it is a popcorn movie so just enjoy whatever is in it!",Null,1,4,6 September 2010

They encountered hilarious situations, annoying tourists and violent criminals. the whole situation is so funny. Jennifer Aniston plays such a likable character, and I laughed so do hard when she was getting to guess the skateboard! I literally laughed and teared for five minutes.A good thing about 'We're the Millers' is that it is just naturally funny without being offensive or pretentious. The vibe is great, and the heartwarming elements makes the plot even better to watch. I really enjoyed it.",Null,1,4,28 August 2013
Disturbia," Suspenseful thriller
","This film is about a young man discovering various disturbing things about his neighbours, while being put under house arrest.This thriller really works. The plot is captivating and suspenseful that will keep you on the edge of the seat. The build up to the climax is excellent, as little secrets (such as extramarital affairs) get revealed, and gradually the secrets become bigger. The suspense is well maintained for over 30 minutes at the end of the film. The name 'Kale' sounds so much like 'kill', and there are many times that I thought Ashley said 'kill' instead of 'Kale'. By the way, 'kale' is a type of Chinese vegetables. I find this film very suspenseful, and I would definitely recommend it!",Null,0,1,19 August 2007
Edward Scissorhands," A truly deserving film
","This film is about a man who was born with scissors as hands. He lived a lonely life in a mansion until he was brought to the world be a cosmetics saleslady.it is quite amazing that this film achieved so much with a simple but innovative plot. Edward is 'handicapped', but he is able to achieve so much that others cannot even dream of doing. This is a stark reminder that everyone has their own strengths, and we must not judge others prematurely until we have uncovered their strengths. I also like the humour in the first half of the film, before things turns sour. The haircut scenes are hilarious! The second half of the film shows how powerfully destructive gossips can be. It saddens me to see such an ending. This film is touching and affecting. Coupled with Johnny Depp's great acting through his spectrum of facial expressions, this film deserves all the praise it gets.",Null,0,0,21 September 2007
Silver Linings Playbook," Great performances
","This film is about a man with bipolar disorder, who finds sanity and hope in life through a quirky woman.'Silver Linings Playbook' tells the life of a young man, whose life is shattered before he meets a quirky woman called Tiffany. Through a series of constructive activities, they both find meaning and hope. I think the two main characters are very well portrayed. They are magnetic and fascinating in their own way. I really like the way that both of them find healing and solace from each other. It is a comforting and satisfying scenario. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper both act well, making their characters so alive and convincing. It is a pity that Jacki Weaver's role is so small, I think it is a bit of a waste of a great actress. Overall, I think 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a film with great performances.",Null,1,4,12 January 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," Fun and exciting family adventure
","This film is about a bride to be who is turned into a giant superwoman on her wedding day. She and other monsters are then recruited to combat aliens who are invading the Earth.The idea of monsters fighting aliens is new, and the plot is well written to include family fun and more grown up topics such as accepting oneself and the ability to unleash one's hidden potential when you are self confident. The monsters are cuddly cute. I particularly like the brainless jelly monster, the it absorbs then unload objects sounds gross but comes out hilarious visually.'Monsters vs Aliens' provide fun entertainment for all ages.",Null,0,1,30 July 2009

","This film is about several talented black singers trying to make it famous with the help of a record company boss in Detroit.The most striking feature of this film is that it features so many songs sung powerfully. The songs are memorable and phenomenal. I really liked the acting as well. The scene where Jennifer Hudson has a final argument with Jamie Foxx on New Year's eve is particularly moving. The emotions and tensions flow from the actors and actresses so well that anyone can connect to how they feel. I also liked the idea that story scenes get incorporated within the songs, so that we get to hear the whole song but and yet we also see how the story unfolds.",Null,1,2,19 May 2007
Step Up 2: The Streets," Vibrant, delightful and energetic
","This film is about a young woman fighting for her passion and her future in street dancing.I find 'Step Up 2 The Streets' a major improvement compared to 'Step Up'. 'Step Up 2 The Streets' has an engaging and inspiring plot, telling people that as long you you work hard, you can live your dream. There is a lot of dancing as well, the dance scenes flow naturally with the plot and are not contrived. Those dancers in the film deserve applause, and their moves are spectacular! The moves kept on surprising and impressing me throughout the film. 'Step Up 2 The Streets' is vibrant, delightful and energetic, and I enjoyed watching it.",Null,0,0,8 November 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," I can't believe I laughed so hard!
","This film is about a group of friends trying to help a forty year old man who is still a virgin.'The 40 Year Old Virgin' is a special film. It has a lot of nude and sex scenes, many swear words and racist jokes, but amazingly it still comes across as adorable and fun. Andy is a well sculpted character, in the first scenes he is already shown to be a weirdo spending hours making a dish he does not eat during weekends. Yet he is strange in a cute way that makes viewers care about him. His transformation is hilarious, and the ending is ever so sweet. The film is so funny, one joke comes right after another that I can hardly stop laughing. I have not been entertained by a movie so thoroughly for a long time!",Null,0,1,30 January 2009

","This film is about a journalist who goes to Iraq to find his ultimate story to prove to his wife the value of existence. He then travels with an eccentric ex American secret agent who claims to have supernatural abilities.'The Men Who Stare at Goats' may have a great concept, but unfortunately it is not developed to anywhere interesting. It is a mix of comedy, action, drama and sci-fi. None of these elements are developed enough to make it stand out or make it shine. The plot is thin and underdeveloped, it cannot decide whether it wants to convince me there are supernatural powers or makes me shiver due to all the complicated politics in the army. It does not make me care about the characters or what they do either. The ending conflict is so weakly staged which feels so contrived. The end result of the film is a confusing and dull collection of scenes.",Null,68,129,17 January 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Enjoyable if you watch it brain-off
","This film tells the story of a group of secret agents fighting against the odds to prove that a secret terrorist organisation called The Syndicate does exist, and to destroy it.'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' begins with an intense scene involving Tom Cruise hanging on to an flying airplane, a scene that is in the trailers. The scene is really intense, and I am really quite amazed by the stunts. It looks real and not computer generated, which means it is really crazily dangerous for the crew and the stuntman!The plot then twists and turns, and brings us to various countries. The motorcycle chase scene is very thrilling, I can really feel the speed and the ferocity of the characters relying on speed to stay alive. One problem I find with 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' is that it relies too much on movie logic, meaning that some plot progressions don't actually make sense. For example, the underwater scene (which is also in the trailer) ends in an implausible and actually unscientific way. And the constant manipulation and counter-manipulation between Ethan and Ilsa gets a bit confusing as well. That does not spoil the enjoyable factors of the film though. It is a good action blockbuster, but I prefer Ghost Protocol better.",Null,9,20,29 July 2015
She's the Man," So fun and entertaining
","This film is about a teenage girl who poses as her twin brother to attend his school, so that she can play in the boys' soccer team.'She's the Man' is unbelievably hilarious! I laughed out loud so many times, and I even curled up into a ball from laughing. The film has no gross humour, which is refreshing for a change.Amanda Bynes is quite convincing in her (admittedly over the top) male mannerisms, there are so many times when I thought her male voice must have been dubbed using a man's voice. Though the sweet ending ventures into the usual chick flick territory, 'She's the Man' is still a very fun and entertaining film to watch.",Null,1,2,2 January 2013
Jarhead," Great acting
","This film is about a marine's life in the desert during the Gulf war.This is not a war film. In fact, war doesn't happen until almost the end. You may be complaining about the lack of action, but so are the characters. This film is more about the lack of direction and frustration of life in the desert.Acting is great. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are both very good. The cinematography is excellent. Near the end, when they walked in the fire lit desert, it reminds me a little of The Chronicles of Riddick.There are two minor problems with the movie though. One of which is that the background music is far too loud. I have to turn the volume to one third of the previous level when there is music playing. Being loud does not mean being impressive. Hollywood filmmakers will have to learn this. The other problem is that Asian Americans are noticeable absent in this film, while all the other ethnic groups are. I wonder why.",Null,0,1,3 June 2006
Shrek Forever After," Tired of the same old jokes
","This film is about Shrek the ogre missing his old days when he was an ogre that people feared. He signs a magical contract with grave consequences, and he had to rectify his mistake.The beginning of 'Shrek Forever After' was not so promising, as the scenes were filled with the same jokes over and over again. And the jokes, which consists of mostly belching and other annoying things, were not even that funny. After the unpromising start, the film remains dull and unfunny. The plot is thin, even considering that I know I am not watching an Oscar worthy film. The jokes and novelties are wearing thin, and they should have stopped at 'Shrek the Third'.",Null,1,2,28 September 2010
Dunkirk," An very effective cinematic experience
","This film tells the story of 400,000 British and French soldiers in the Second World War, who were stranded on a beach in Dunkirk, surrounded by German troops. Their only hope of escape diminishes with each passing minute, as the rescue ship and the only pier gets frequently bombed by the Germans.I say that 'Dunkirk' is no-frills because it does not show any body parts flying around in merciless battles. It does not need the gory scenes to show just exactly how traumatising and senseless wars are. The soldiers are constantly under psychological threat, as they may be shot or bombed any minute. The beach is so very exposed, there is nowhere to run to. The scene when bombs rhythmically explode on the beach, and each one getting closer to the viewers is very effective. That is quite enough to stun viewers into silence. There are many brief but very effective scenes, such as the final Tom Hardy scene that last for only a few seconds and it is not even in focus. What makes it so profound is the unsaid. The scene in which Cillian Murphy asks for the final time how George is doing is very moving as well, as the boy keeps calm and forgives for the collective good.The soundtrack is very effective as well. The sound effects are akin to what can be expected in a horror film, creating heightened suspense and deepens anticipation.It is safe to say that 'Dunkirk' will drive many people to tears. It certainly did so to me, and I honestly say I enjoyed every minute of this great cinematic experience.",Null,1,5,16 August 2017
The Machinist," Alarmingly captivating
","This film is about a young man plagued by insomnia, starting to have rather unusual experiences.This film is quite amazing. The most striking thing is the transformation of Christian Bale to a state of cachexia. I particularly remember the alarming scene where Christian Bale puts on a pair of trousers, and his waist is too thin to support the trousers that they slide right down. Seroiusly, his body reminds me of all the pictures of concentration camps that I see in history textbooks. It is almost shocking that an actor would go as far to prepare himself in the role.The plot itself is tight and gripping. In fact, the whole film has this captivating quality and atmosphere that leaves you begging for more. The Machinist is so memorable that it will surely be a cult favourite, if it hasn't already become one.",Null,2,3,8 August 2007
The Intouchables," A beautiful tale of mutual inspiration

I really like the fact that both Philippe and Driss are so wildly different from each other, but yet they can complement each other and make each other grow. Philippe is cultured but reserved, while Driss is playful and hedonistic. I like the scenes where Philippe is selling the painting by Driss, the scene in the opera and the final scene. They complement each other so well, and they both treasure each other's friendship. It's a beautiful tale of mutual inspiration. I love it.",Null,0,0,14 March 2014
Ratatouille," Excellent animation
","This film is about a culinary rat who befriends a young man, and displays his cooking skills in a fine Parisian restaurant.After watching this highly anticipated film, I can only say that the positive word of mouth is highly justified. The characters are lovely and cute, and they are all unique in their own way. The main character the culinary rat, is dedicated and determined. He develops an unlikely friendship with Linguini, who works at a restaurant but is clueless about cooking. The adventures they have together is exciting and engaging. The animation is excellent, everything is realistic and attractive. It is such a joy to see hundreds of rats cooking, which is a scene that could otherwise be unpleasant. The major theme of being able to succeed if you are dedicated and hard working is inspiring and encouraging. 'Ratatouille' is a gem that mixes entertainment and positive encouragement. It makes me happy, satisfied and fulfilled.",Null,0,1,18 October 2007
Bad Teacher," Funny and entertaining
","This film is about a bad teacher who is primarily focused on finding a rich husband. Before that, she has to find enough money for breast enhancement.As the title suggests, this film is all about the bad teacher. She is selfish, self-centred and manipulative. Somehow, Cameron Diaz manages to make this unlikable character funny and likable. Whatever Miss Halsey does is just full of laughs, sometimes even outrageously funny. The best thing is that there is no formula to be adhered to, so 'Bad Teacher' keeps on surprising viewers with great jokes and plot developments. And Justin Timberlake's weirdo character is funny as well. I really enjoyed 'Bad Teacher'.",Null,2,5,27 August 2011

","This film is about a young man who gained superpowers while trying to find out why his father disappeared years ago.'The Amazing Spider-Man' is what a blockbuster should be. The pace is fast, and there is not a moment of dullness. There is plenty of action scenes, and most of the scenes have amazing special effects. Even in 2D, I was astounded by the level of detail of the Spiderman swinging through skyscrapers in New York. There are comedic scenes that got the whole house laughing, and there are also spine chilling scenes involving heights. I like the emotional subplot very much too. The emotional connections between Peter and Gwen, and also between Gwen's father and Peter are well portrayed, that the film is moving me to the point of tears.

The young Ryan Philippe is magnetic in his role, as he gets transfixed by money, glitter and fame. He pays a high price for his lifestyle, ultimately causing rather sad events. Acting is great by the now big stars, but at that time unknowns. The story makes people ponder upon the priorities in life, and the need to choose between glitter and fame versus friendship and wholesomeness. The music is uplifting and fits the film well.

He turns out to be the unlikely hero who saves the Lego worlds from am evil billionaire.The characters are so cute and colorful, and I really like the scenes where they show the posts number on the screen. The story is lighthearted and fun, and actually borders on being silly. If it was a film with real life actors, it would not have worked. It would have been to silly and too contrived. But it's Lego, and therefore it had to be fun, and every bass thing about it can be excused! It's not just a film, but a film that brings back collective memories of the childhood. Therefore it is more enjoyable than just the film on its own. Tinted by the happy childhood memories, everything about the movie becomes awesome!",Null,0,1,24 June 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," A very good drama
","This film tells the story of a HIV infected man selling an unapproved cocktail of drugs to help the HIV infected people in Dallas.Matthew McConaughey was a heart throb who appears topless in romantic comedies. He was known for his looks and his muscles. In the recent few years, he matured in both his looks and his acting skills. From a psychopathic character in 'Killer Joe', a sadomasochistic homosexual character in 'The Paperboy' or a lonesome fugitive in 'Mud', he shows much skill and versatility in his roles. 'Dallas Buyers Club' pushes his impressive portfolio even further, as he loses much weight and transform himself into an emaciated person for the role as an HIV infected man. His transformation is quite alarming, and reminds me of the classic transformation by Christian Bale for 'The Machinist'.Jared Leto is also amazing as a man who identifies as a woman. His / her mannerisms and even the voice is so convincing. The time when he walks into his father's office, retorting his father's remark about God is truly heartbreaking.The plot raises questions as to where we should draw the line of what is right and what is wrong. Is smuggling life saving medicine wrong? What drug should be approved and why? There are so many questions left for the viewers to ponder on.'Dallas Buyers Club' is a very good drama, with excellent acting and a very touching plot. I hope it wins a few Oscars.",Null,2,3,9 January 2014
Now You See Me," A visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza
","This film is about four magicians who team up to perform the most spectacular magical heists ever seen in history.'Now You See Me' tells the story of how four magicians perform the unbelievable heists while on stage, such as robbing a bank in Paris while they are on stage in Las Vegas. They give away the money to the audience, making them an overnight sensation. It also thrilled me to see it, as it is refreshing to see a heist in Robin Hood style! All the magic involved in the heists is explained, with credible explanations as to how they did a seemingly impossible thing. I like this a lot, as it is easy for a film to fall victim to movie logic, i.e. it's magic and therefore it can be ridiculous and non-sensible. The constant cat and mouse game is thrilling, and the end gets even better. When a group of people seem to be two steps ahead of the game, they are in fact three steps behind. Nothing is as it appears, echoing the theme of magic.'Now You See Me' is a visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza. It kept me amazed and engaged throughout, and I enjoyed every second of it.",Null,3,8,24 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A great blockbuster

It results in a feast of never ending special effects that never cease to wonder. I'm so impressed by the amazing visual effects, they are so real and so convincing. The scene where the survival of the mutants are critical in the cave, when the fraction of a second is stretched to minutes, is excellent. It conveys there urgency and heightens the thrill. The scene where a stadium is lifted up is also awe inspiring. There's so much spectacular scenes packed into the film, making it a great blockbuster.",Null,0,2,30 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Stay until the end of the credits!
","This film tells the story of The Avengers who have to be regulated in view of the mass devastation they cause during their missions. However, they are divided on this issue, and neither side is unwilling to back down.It is interesting to see a 'Captain America' film becoming an ensemble film, moving from a film about a character to a film like 'The Avengers'. I am slightly disappointed by this, because I like Captain Rogers. However, the resultant story is full of adventure and marvel, exactly because there are many characters involved. The film brings in Ant Man, and even Spiderman, making the film rich with personalities and magical powers (meaning great special effects).Marvel certainly knows how to make an entertaining superhero action film, with a good balance of adrenaline and comedy. And there are two bonus scenes, remember to stay until the end of the credits.",Null,2,7,27 April 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A vehicle to introduce an American version of Hogwarts and Harry Potter
","This film tells the story of an English wizard who travels to New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures. The creatures get loose, and he has to capture all of them back before they create citywide panic and destruction.I was looking forward to 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' a lot. After watching it, I have to say I am mildly disappointed. Though the visuals are great, the story is rather weak. The beasts are not portrayed to be fantastic at all. They merely look scary, fly around and be aggressive. I am not sure how they are fantastic, if anything they are scary especially to young children.The film is not about where to find the beasts either. It is about capturing them, instead of finding them in the wild. The action is sparse and muted, and there is little adventure in the story. It does not grip me or captivate me. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal to me is the most disappointing, because he is made to look like a - ahem - innocent and mischievous character, when he could look fierce and powerful. His lack of eye contact, and a lack of confidence in general makes me difficult to associate him as the protagonist.To be honest, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is merely a vehicle to reconstruct the hugely successful 'Harry Potter' series, set in the USA with an alternate universe of wizards. It feels more like a cash cow, milking off the success of the much better 'Harry Potter' series.",Null,2,6,18 November 2016
Gandhi," A powerful biopic of wisdom, compassion and selflessness
","This film is about Gandhi, a man with remarkable vision and wisdom, who led India to independence.'Gandhi' is truly remarkable. The most amazing aspect of this film is probably Ben Kingsley's performance. He gives a fine performance in every stage of Gandhi's life: as a young lawyer with a unique vision, as a wise and compassionate leader and as a frail elderly.Another striking feature is the vast logistic involved in the film. There are so many crowd scenes with literally thousands of people. The organisation of these scenes is an impressive feat in its own right, not to mention the massive visual and emotional impact that these scenes provoke.Last but not least, the dialog in Gandhi is very well written. Only few movies can deliver powerful lines in every scene. Gandhi's immense wisdom, compassion and selflessness are shown through these amazing words, sending shock waves of respect and sympathy through viewers.'Gandhi' is a powerful and emotional biopic. Its compassion touches me deeply. It deserved every Oscar it got.",Null,2,3,16 November 2008
The Conjuring 2," Scary!
","This film tells the story of the famous exorcists couple from the Church, who wants to stop investigating and confronting the paranormal. However, the Church sends them to London to investigate a very sinister haunting in a north London house that is home to a single mother and her four children.'The Conjuring' was so super scary that I rate it as one of the scariest films for me. 'The Conjuring 2' follows a similar plot, with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson investigating and confronting the demonic spirits. There are many scary scenes in this film, to the point that I developed a headache towards the end because I was so scared. Yet, the general feel of the film is not as scary compared to the first film. I think perhaps it is because the final showdown is short, and the demon appeared way too late in the film. Still, it is a very scary film!",Null,0,1,19 February 2017
Jackie," It's horribly boring
","This film tells the aftermath of President Kennedy's assassination, from the perspective of his wife Jackie Kennedy. It is told through flashbacks from Jackie Kennedy and a journalist who interviews her after the dust has settled.The assassination was such a shocking and historically significant event. There is so much material that could have made it into the film, making the legacy shine even brighter. Yet, 'Jackie' is a disjointed, fragmented mess that is atrociously boring. Jackie Kennedy is portrayed to be a royally difficult woman who retorts at everything that is said to her. Her character is controlling, aggressive and deceitful. How she treats the journalist is just totally unacceptable. How she talks to her loyal staff about funeral arrangements is simply horrid. And her whispering way of speech! It is so pretentious, fake and basically revolting. I cannot find one redeeming feature in this character. The pace is super slow, the timeline is not linear and hence I could not get into the story at all. To make things worse, the music is far too loud and frequent. It's like listening to funeral music for 90 minutes. I lost all interest in it within twenty minutes, but I persevered to see if it would get any better. And it didn't.",Null,6,10,26 January 2017
No Strings Attached," Lacklustre
","This film is about two sex friends who, slowly but surely, develop feelings for each other.Considering the cast and the big budget, 'No Strings Attached' is very disappointing. The two leads are very attractive, but they have little chemistry with each other. Maybe it's to do with the nature of their initial relationship, they do not have any sparks with each other, and hence their subsequent feelings seem so forced and unrealistic. There is little comedy either, the whole plot is plainly delivered. With nothing much to laugh about, no romance to savour, 'No Strings Attached' becomes a lacklustre bore.",Null,29,50,30 April 2011
Tropic Thunder," Not so funny
","This film is about several actors filming for a failing Hollywood war production in the middle of a real war zone.I did not find this film as funny as people claim. Many jokes fall flat. Jack Black makes exaggerated shouts and moves all the time, which is annoying rather than funny. The 'Simple Jack' joke was not funny, it's just plain silly. I find it hard to believe that 'Simply Jack' happens to be the only film the Vietnamese drug lords have seen. Isn't that too much of a coincidence? Having a child to lead a drug gang is in fact sad. References to Jennifer Love Hewitt and Lance make bring a small giggle, but that's it. I think this film had so much promise with the interesting idea and a stellar cast. But unfortunately it did not work for me.",Null,0,1,29 October 2008

","This film is about a socially inept young man who fights seven evil exes to get the girl he wants.I did not think I would enjoy a film like 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World', but I did enjoy it so much. The plot is refreshing and different, and its video game fantasy elements spices up the film visually and plot wise as well. There are a few one liners which are wildly funny. There is this line with the 'L' word, and a subsequent reference to it, that make me laugh so hard! Kieran Culkin's performance in the film is worth mentioning as well, as the presence of his character provides so many funny moments. Take the film lightheartedly, and 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'will be so enjoyable.",Null,1,5,10 February 2011

Her ways of talking, walking and doing are all fairytale like, making her so convincing as a fantasy character. The cultural clashes of fairytale land and the modern day world are interesting and entertaining to watch. All the costumes and sets are so thoughtful and beautiful.

Putting people in charge of the various functions of the brain, especially emotions, is very interesting. It provides many people, especially children, a fun way to understand how the brain works! The story is very fun, and I really like the concepts like abstract thinking chamber and the train of thought!

The Duchess," A 3D portrait of the tragic Lady Georgiana
","This film is about the eventful marriage and the untimely relationship of Lady Georgiana, The Duchess of Devonshire.'The Duchess' has an intricate and well layered plot that captivates me throughout. Lady Georgiana's charm, wit, quest for freedom, endurance and ability to survive such immense psychological hardship is beyond words. Her character is developed very well that draws viewers into her life, and hence into the film. Keira Knightley is excellent as a well raised intellectual lady living in unfortunate circumstances. She expresses her character to the full, creating much resonance regarding the tragic happenings of Lady Georgiana. The lavish sets and costumes also create a visual feast that constantly pleases the eye that demands much visual stimulation.

The Commitments," A dismally boring film
","This film is about a bunch of deprived people in a slum area forming a band. They hope to make it big with their soul music.I find 'The Commitments' tedious and boring. The characters engage in endless tirade, shouting profanities at each other constantly. The way they treat each other is simply sad. The clothes they wear are all dismally coloured. Furthermore, the film is set in a deprived area, meaning unattractive sets and locations. All these things make the film unattractive to me. It is made worse by the poor lighting. Many scenes are poorly lit. A scene featuring the tour bus going down the road is a prime example. The cameraman obviously focused on the sky, making the road, houses and the bus very dark.'The Commitments' sounds like an uplifting film with heart and soul. But I was wrong. It is dismal, hostile and unlikable.",Null,8,26,2 November 2008

It has high speed car chases with lots of collision and gunshots. The ultra short scenes (all under one second each) and the shaky camera gives urgency and thrill, but it is so hard to actually work out what is happening.There is a lot of action and adrenaline in the film, but the plot seems not to have a focus. Nor does it make sense either, as it feels like an all-action-no-information film. All Bond does is to run around the globe after his target, and viewers are left to wonder how he made it. I don't find myself caring for the plot or the characters. I don't know why this happens, but something is not right with the film and I don't know what.",Null,772,1107,6 November 2008

The supernatural suspense that it creates captivates me throughout the film. How is this change going to end up? Is it really better than the existing reality? And for the first time, Ashton Kutcher looks like a real actor with acting skills. That's quite an achievement on its own! For me, it is also a thought provoking film. The obvious message is that you cannot play God. Everything is destined to be, and messing about causes unimaginable consequences. Another less obvious thought simmers below the surface though. Just when you think your life is bad, there could be a certain you in an alternate universe, living a life infinitely worse than the one you are having.

There are no sound effects to enhance the atmosphere, and there lighting is so dark which makes it hard to see what is happening.

It is not as mischievously fun as 'The Ladykillers', or as plot driven as 'Miller's Crossing'. Instead, 'No Country For Old Men' uses a lot of cold blooded shocks. Javier Bardem is amazing as a cold blooded person. His face never even twitch a bit when he kills random people. However, the plot is a little hard to follow. There are many loose ends that are not explained. I am also a bit annoyed by the surrealistic ease of everyone finding everyone.",Null,1,3,26 January 2008

It is gross, crude and annoying. The plot is very thin and ridiculous. The constant toilet humour and the never ending preoccupation with size of the genitals are not funny at all. Those acronyms are slightly cool, but when repeated ten times, they become plain annoying. Mike Myers' character is very annoying, unsympathetic and silly. The only redeeming value is the presence of Jessica Alba. I recommend staying away from this boring and cheap 'comedy'.",Null,2,9,6 August 2008

The perspective of the viewers from a camera or from the news conveys the sense of urgency and excitement, as if I am getting the scenes as soon as it happens. The quick pacing also heightens the sense of urgency and thrill. The amazing story kept me engrossed and captivated by the last one hour of the movie. Computer animations are so perfectly real.

As they have all the songs already, all they have to do is to make a story that fits the songs. This is done so wonderfully that they could even make dialogs out of songs that feels so natural, and not contrived at all. The dance moves are great fun too. And you can also tell that they put in a lot of effort to make every scene as cheerful as possible, as everything is brightly coloured and everyone is merrily dressed.

The story drags on a little in the beginning, and I wondered where the magnificent scenes are. When the gang finally arrive at the mountain, I was completely blown away by the amazing visuals of the Dragon and its flames. The ending finale is a series of wows, as the flames, and the color change of the Dragon is very impressive. The ending elicited another wow from me, as it is so abrupt.

Yes, Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck give great performances, but I was utterly disappointed after watching it. I felt I have completely wasted 2.5 hours of my life.The plot is highly confusing. It's so hard to follow who is who, who does what and why do they do the things they do. There seems to be no explanation as to why they kill each other in the film. The pacing is so slow, there is so little action in the film, all they do is talk. Even after Jesse James died, the film stretches on and on.

This story plot is EXACTLY the same as 'Men In Honor' starring Robert de Niro & Cuba J Gooding.I don't know much about American soccer either. Therefore, all the scenes when they played on the field became a terrible bore to me. The story is touching but I could predict the whole film after watching the first 5 minutes of it, well, apart from the car crash thing at the end which I did not predict.I only watched the film to see Denzel Washington, who is a great actor.

Though there is not much action, it is still captivating to see the transformation from an ordinary man to a superhero. The remainder of the film is filled with heroic action. The balance of action versus violence is excellent, there are many fights but it has no senseless violence. Apart from the action, 'Batman Begins' has a human touch. The relationship between Bruce and Rachel is well developed, drawing viewers emotionally closer to Bruce, as Bruce is not just a distant unreachable superhero.

Are we really expected to believe that they fall for each other so intensely that easily? And the subplot about the Dutch author is simply ridiculous. I'm very unconvinced that someone would track down an author, fly half way across the world to ask a question. The phlegmatic response from the author is disgusting, yet oddly satisfying. I honestly thought the film was boring and annoying.

After watching 'Twilight', I declare that I do not understand what the fuss is about.I find the plot very slow and boring. The characters often state the obvious. When they are not, they say ultra cheesy lines which make me laugh because they are so bad. There are many obvious plot holes which shows that the script is poorly written. For example, I find it hard to believe that the vampire residence is full of glass walls which allows maximum sunlight penetration. There are a few other obvious ones that I spotted, but I will not reveal them here.I don't find the film thrilling, touching or romantic.

It's nostalgic top see the old plated characters, or as the film says, retro characters. the story is great, it contrasts squeaky clean games and violent games, and exclaims what the world has come to (in Disney's point of view anyway).

To Rome With Love," A distracted film with only a loose central focus of love in Rome
","This film is about the unusual encounters of several visitors and residents in Rome.'To Rome With Love' retains the Woody Allen style by being very dialog heavy, despite most of it is in Italian. A few minutes into the film, we are treated with a airborne scene with a familiar Woody Allen style paranoia and anxiety. The rest of the film is quite a departure from his work. We see various individuals having to make difficult decisions in their relationships, but not in a Woody Allen style.Two of the subplots are rather ridiculous that they end up being confusing and annoying, and not entertaining or fun. The Roberto Begnini subplot makes no sense, and his over the top acting it eclipses the comedic elements. The subplot is also out of place with the rest of the film's atmosphere.For the Jesse Eisenberg subplot, it portrays his struggle against the charming Ellen Page. It is a good subplot about the challenges of love, but Alec Baldwin is always around, making comments like a ghost only visible to Jesse Eisenberg. The commentary is annoying and out of place, putting me off the subplot. For the Penelope Cruz subplot, it is funny but too short. I enjoyed it the most out of all the subplot.Overall, 'To Rome With Love' is a film with too many subplots. It appears too distracted, with only a loose central focus of love in Rome. None of the subplots are fully engaging or fully satisfying.",Null,0,1,13 August 2013
Bridesmaids," Probably overrated
","This film is about a woman who is asked to be the maid of honor at her friend's wedding. Her life spirals downwards from then on.'Bridesmaids' is said to be the female version of 'The Hangover', because apparently it is outrageously funny. With that expectation in my head, I found 'Bridesmaids' a little disappointing. 'Bridesmaids' does have laugh out loud moments, which consists of very crude toilet humour.Some say that comedies do not need character development, but in this film you really need some character development, as it is about the interaction of a group of newly met friends. Unfortunately, there is little character development, so I don't really know who the bridesmaids really are. Helen is the only bridesmaid that stands out, all the others are just to fill up the screen space or to make Kristen Wiig pretty. The story is quite slow for a comedy, and a joke is repeated over and over for minutes. It appears to me that 'Bridesmaids' is just a vessel for a high profile one man band comedy for Kristen Wiig. I think 'Bridesmaids' is overrated, but still enjoyable.",Null,0,0,30 September 2011

One thing people talked about was that the faster frame rate gave many people headaches because the brain could not process so much information. I watched it at the normal frame rate so I had no headaches.I normally do not understand a thing in a fantasy film, but 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' was straightforward and simple enough for me to completely understand the plot. At over 2 hours, the pace could be quicker, and some subplots could be edited out. Nevertheless, I did not feel bored at all by the film. The special effects are very good, and the 3D is convincing as well. The characters are well designed, and I was especially impressed by the astounding grace of Galadriel, played by Cate Blanchett. The subplot about Bilbo's unexpected bravery is very satisfying to watch as well. 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is interesting and entertaining, and I may give 'The Lord of the Rings' series another chance if the next Hobbit is as good as this.",Null,2,11,16 December 2012

However, I think this plot is effective and conveys the vast amount of love the music teacher has for the children. He does not love anyone less because of the way they behave. He continues to use his music to positively influence the people around him, so that the world can become a better place.The songs are amazing, so serene and touching.

Their lives then degenerate into a tale that no one wants to listen to. Such a transition is heart wrenching but strangely captivating.The plot is very engaging and above all, real. What other film contains such a real life dialog about having children or not? Because the plot is so real, one can easily relate to it, making the film ever more engaging. It is ironic that the most real conversation they have is with a supposed lunatic. Maybe we are all living deluded lives, and clarity can only stem from lunacy?

Mark gets attention and adoration from du Pont, but soon his limelight is robbed by his older brother. There are ups and downs, but I find the ups and downs not engaging enough. The road to Olympic glory could be inspiring and touching, but I guess this is not the focus of this film, therefore this journey to Olympic glory is very understated in 'Foxcatcher'.The many subplots are not adequately explained, such as the appearance of military vehicles and firearms; and more importantly the homo-erotic undertones of du Pont's wrestling training.

'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' has great special effects. The chimpanzees look real in amazing detail. Their movements are swift and acrobatically complicated, and I often wonder if these are computer generated effects or real chimpanzees. James Franco's friendship with his chimpanzee is touching, The story is engaging and easy to follow, with a strong message saying that nature is not to be messed about.

There is not a moment of boredom or time filler. The events portrayed in 'City of God' are so shocking. Lives are constantly lost due to random fights and shootouts. Lives have no value, and we only see a mourning scene once in the entire film. Towards the end of the film, I feel my spine tingling with fear and shock.

Owen Wilson does a great job to bring the Lightning McQueen character alive, as he is lively and happy all the time. The car chases are well composed throughout, but I must say watching car chases for two hours gets rather boring.

It's not a gangster film where there is senseless violence everywhere. Though there is some violence, it does not take over as the main theme. The story fact concentrates on the interpersonal relationships of the brothers. It tells how Reggie falls in love with Frances, how she feels after the marriage and the path to its destruction. It tells how Ron can be eccentric sometimes, and yet the strong bond of brothers keep them unless. I find the plot engrossing and engaging. It feels as if the film gives an intimate glimpse of their lives, not just their achievements but their emotional connections well. I really feel for the Kray brothers, and evoking such emotions is something unusual for a gangster film!The actors playing the brothers look quite alike, but not identical because they still have different mannerisms. Imagine the shock I have when the credits reveal that the two brothers are both played by Tom Hardy!",Null,1,1,13 June 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," An enjoyable blockbuster
","This film tells the story of the ensemble of Marcel superheroes uniting to fight against an evil man called Thanos.It is a joy just to watch the numerous famous faces in the film! The story is good, visuals are fantastic, and there are loads of fighting. It has all the elements of a blockbuster.However, the plot doesn't drive itself, and is not overly engaging because of the vast number of characters in different locations and subplots. It feels a bit fragmented to be. Still, I enjoyed the film a lot. By the way, the ending surprised me a little, and I guess we have to wait for the resolution of the story in the next Avengers gymf.",Null,4,12,25 April 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Transcends to the level where an action film looks beautiful and artistic
","This film is about the love, power struggle and retaliation between powerful martial arts masters in the middle kingdom a long time ago.It's been a long time since I last watched 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I remember thinking that it was not so good. Even the wires lifting the actors were exposed! This is one of the worst goofs you can get. I was even inclined to believe the conspiracy theories that the Western world hyped up a mediocre film to embarrass the Chinese.After watching it on TV again today, my views are completely changed. I am quite captivated by the complicated relationships between the lead characters. Each of them are developed well, and have their own special quality. Li Mu Bai is portrayed to be a compassionate but reserved master in martial arts. His masterful quality radiates from his character. Shu Lien is a clever woman who is great at resolving urgent situations. Jen Yu is a rebellious young girl who has no remorse towards all her mischievous acts. This character development is powerful. I develop a lot of respect for Li Mu Bai, and hatred for Jen Yu.Locations are also beautiful, particular the forest scenes and the desert scenes. Fights are well choreographed, and smoothly executed. Instead of senseless violence that is a common problem with action films, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' transcends to the level where an action film looks beautiful and artistic.'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a good film. Though it is obviously made to appeal to the Western world, it is still an enjoyable and captivating.",Null,0,1,12 August 2008
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I like this QT film the best
","Out of all the Quentin Tarantino films, I like this one the best. This film is the most easily accessible, perhaps because of the pop culture references. Leonardo's acting is great, and he makes a great team with Brad. Another thing I like is the fact that it's not all about killing, but there's a really touching friendship between Leonardo and Brad. I enjoyed it a lot.",Null,13,23,26 July 2019
Behind The Candelabra," I was blown away by this film!
","This film is about the relationship between the famous and flamboyant piano player and his young male friend.'Behind the Candelabra' tells a fascinating story of Liberace and his lover Scott. Right from the first few minutes of the film, we are already taken into a world beyond imagination. The set depicting Liberace's residence is lavish beyond belief, and the costumes are dazzlingly amazing as well.Michael Douglas is very good as the piano star, as he portrays a very wide variety of states. He can be camp, authoritative, confident, loving and in despair all in the same movie. Everything about his performance as Liberace exudes a confident pink flavour. He is so natural and so into the role, that makes me have even more respect for him The make up artists deserve a special mention, as they transform Michael Douglas and Matt Damon with their superb make up skill. Whether it is an older, younger, debilitated or post plastic surgery look, they always look perfect.Two hours flew by as the story was very engaging. I feel sad for Liberace for him not being able to establish a lasting relationship. How he had to disguise a break up as a termination of employment was rather sad as well.'Behind the Candelabra' is an excellent biographical film. I was completely blown away by it.",Null,2,7,10 June 2013
Gone Girl," A captivating mystery thriller
","This film tells the story of a man who comes home to find her wife gone. He tries to find his wife, but soon he's accused of murdering his wife.'Gone Girl' has probably the most intense and captivating plot for a fun I've watched for a while. The story twists and turns like no other, and when you think you've figured it out, it surprises you again. There is constant mystery and thrill, even though information is presented to the viewers early on. The ending - who would have predicted it! There is much room for viewers to imagine what life will be like for Nick in the future. That could be material for a sequel, in fact I do hope the story will continue from where it ends in this film.",Null,0,2,18 January 2015
Django Unchained," I was bored by the very slow pacing
","This film is about a freed slave partnering with a bounty hunter to seek revenge and free his wife.'Django Unchained' is a action western, but it is far too long to be interesting and engrossing. At almost three hours, it is a struggle to follow the story and keep being interested in it. There is far too much dialog to be an action film. For example, Christopher Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio talk on the dinner table for literally an hour before anything happens. The pace of the ending ten minutes is very very quick, and if the previous 2.5 hours were that quick the film would have been shortened by at least 1.5 hours. It's a Quentin Tarantino film, so you know there has to be a lot of blood to the point of being almost comical, and that almost everybody dies in the end. So why not just cut to the chase and show us what we are expecting?",Null,4,10,5 February 2013
Get Out," Unnerving and unexpected
","This film tells the story of a African American man who travels to see his Caucasian girlfriend's parents in their house in the countryside. Though they seem to profusely welcome him, there is something not right about the whole setup. Soon his hunch turns into a deadly reality.'Get Out' has a rather slow pacing to start with, as the story develops and the stage is set. The racial topic is brought up a little to often to be comfortable, but soon the reason for these strange encounters become apparent. The story is thrilling, and there is quite a bit of mystery in the film. The ending is unnerving and unexpected. The audience were very engaged with the film; gasps and applause were quite frequent towards the ending climax. It is an enjoyable thriller.",Null,15,26,30 April 2017
Drive," Seriously, this bored me to death
","This film is about a stunt driver whose is being hunted by gangsters, after his heist has gone wrong.I thought 'Drive' was an adrenaline fueled action film, but in fact it is anything but that. It is more an art house film, but does not succeed in impressing me because of its slow pace and manufactured atmospheric scenes. There are so many times when I just stare at the counter and see how long scenes are unnecessarily stretched to. After the attack in the motel room, Ryan Gosling spends 20 seconds staring into space. Ryan Goslign and Carey Mulligan spends a full minute kissing in the lift. There are so many overlong scenes that just bored me to death. And the heist in question does not happen two thirds into the film! 'Drive' is seriously boring. I wish I could have my 90 minutes back.",Null,11,38,1 October 2011

And it blew me away. The songs are great, the visuals are beautiful and the story is captivating. The trailer certainly doesn't do it justice, and in fact I think it contains the worst bit of the film. I think Will Smith went overboard with the black favour in the initial scene in the cave, which was the bit I didn't like. Other than that, everything is great.",Null,2,5,1 July 2019
Insidious," Very suspenseful and scary
","This film is about a suburban couple dealing with the fright of living in a haunted house, and their son suddenly having fallen into a coma.'Insidious' is such a great supernatural thriller. It does not require gore or sudden loud noises to scare. All the scare is the psychological atmosphere created by masterful filmmaking. The plot is amazingly suspenseful and engaging. It makes you scared, ill at ease and on edge all the time.I really enjoyed 'Insidious', which is something rather unusual as I normally do not like scary movies. If there is a sequel, which there could very well be, I would watch it!",Null,7,12,31 August 2011

I still remember when 'A Brief History of Time' came out, it dominated every window display of every bookshop. It's only logical that people want to see Stephen Hawking's life on screen.The trailer already makes me very interested to see the film, especially the performance of Eddie Redmayne.

What he does not know is that he is the star of a reality TV show.Who would have thought 'Bolt' would be so thrilling and entertaining! The opening action sequence is rushed with adrenaline, it excites me even though it is an animation! The plot is intelligent, interesting and fun, the great thing is that it entertains without the need of any toilet or gross out humour. The super-bark and laser eye scenes are so hilarious, in a cute and mesmerising way. In addition, the transition of Bolt from being a super dog to realising he he has no powers is very well presented, that it makes me feel sad for Bolt. The animation is flawless, and all the characters in the animation are super cute. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of 'Bolt', I think it makes perfect family entertainment.",Null,52,67,13 January 2009

There are no fillers, only one disaster after another. Grounds disappearing, trains flying, buildings collapsing, all the effects are spectacular and scarily real, that I felt myself sank into the seat as I watched the disasters unfold. The pacing is so tight that even just one hour into the film, all the possible calamities ought to have happened. But no, there really are even more disasters. It's like having all the other disaster movies and end of the world movies into one, but even better. I was so engaged by the film.

","This film is about the encounters of a young and promising athlete's encounters with a wise old man.This film reminds me of Finding Forrester starring Matt Damon. Yet, I think it is superior to Finding Forrester, as it captured my attention especially the latter half of the movie.Acting by Scott Mechlowicz is excellent. He is able to convey the anger and frustration of his character fully. I am also very impressed by all the gymnastic moves, and the way that these moves are shot in such a dynamic, graceful and gripping manner.This is a touching and gripping film that you would not want to miss!",Null,2,6,12 November 2006
Velvet Goldmine," Disappointing
","This film is about the rise and fall of a glamorous rock star back in 1970's in Britain.I was not interested in the music, and I watched the film only because of the numerous big stars. So, I saw the stars I wanted to see, and that was it.The Oscar Wilde references is quite a mystery to me. Apart from referencing his homosexuality, what else is there? It seems contrived to have such a reference.The relationship between Brian Slade and Curt Wild is very confusing and hard to follow, as they both seem attracted and yet ambivalent to each other. Christian bale's character as a journalist is simply redundant, and he could have been written out altogether. This would have been better because that would make the story linear, and hence easier to understand.",Null,2,6,11 June 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," Stunning special effects but not so stunning plot
","This film is a fiction/fantasy film about a group of mutants being hunt down by the government.The special effects are very stunning in this film. The anti gravity scenes are particularly well made in the film.However, I think the story is a bit fragmented. It could be because I cannot remember the previous 2 X Men films very well, so I could not completely relate to this film completely. I find the plot a bit complicated. So there are two group of mutants who are against each other, and then the government is hunting both of them down, and then there is a mutant called Jean who wants to kill everyone?! This plot is far too complicated. The characters are not developed so much either, maybe it is because it is assumed that the viewers have watched and remembered what happened in the previous 2 X Men films.It is still a very watchable film, quick paced action without any boring scenes.",Null,0,0,10 November 2006

Her journey is made special by her late husband's loving surprises that he secretly organised before he died.'P.S. I Love You' is a romantic drama that makes you cry. The plot is wonderful, as every second is filled with love and care. It's the kind of love that you love someone so much, that you want the best for them. Its the kind of love that is unconditional, and does not ask for anything in return. It's the kind of love that might be transient, but everlasting in its legacy.

Room," Intense
","This film tells the story of a five year old boy who has never left his room, because he and his mother are held captive for years by a man.The synopsis doesn't give me an idea of the unimaginable horror that is depicted in the film. Such unspeakable crime can be committed only by the most perverted individuals. As a result of this highly emotionally charged issue, 'Room' is highly engaging. Towards the middle of the film, I find every cell in me wants the woman's plan to succeed. I held my breath, I welled up and I sincerely hope there would be some humanity left in the world. Another very emotional scene is the brief TV interview. The interviewer seems so caring and empathic, but asks very biased questions which leads to another emotional zenith. This film depicts the horror of captivity, which I am sure doesn't even match the true abuse and desperation that the victims face.I hope the victims can recover and lead fulfilling lives.",Null,1,8,23 December 2015

The first half has a few funny and also visually impressive fantasy scenes, showing us the fantasy world of Walter. It's entertaining and fun to watch. The second half doesn't have much fantasy scenes anymore, instead focuses on emotional aspects of Walter. I was so touched by many scenes, including the mountain encounter and of course the grand finale - the magazine cover. I am very impressed by the plot, it tells people not to give up, venture out of their comfort zone and just do the things they are dreaming about. It's such a positive film. The only complaint is tee over the top product placement, otherwise 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is a really enjoyable film.",Null,3,8,24 December 2013

'Schindler's List' is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List'. The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me.

The Incredibles," Its popularity is well justified
","This is an animation film about lost heroes resuming their service again to stop evil plots being implemented.I think the runaway success of this film is that the film's lead heroes are very everyday. The family is portrayed to be heroes who have had their glorious days but got disgraced because of a series of negative incidents. They then choose to have a family life and stay away from the limelight. They are reluctant to use their supernatural powers, and only uses them when the situation gets out of hand. This key point is radically different to most superhero movies, where the heroes have always been glorious heroes and will forever be glorious heroes. In this movie, the heroes fall and then rise back up again, creating a positive message for kids.Apart from this fundamental difference from other superhero movies, it also has a great story. It also has cute and attractive animation. This film really deserves the attention and praise, and cannot simply be attributed to be popular because it is an animation.",Null,1,1,23 November 2006

","This film is about a young man embarking an adventure through a fantasy world, fighting against cold blooded princes and evil witches.'Stardust' has an imaginative and relatively complicated storyline. Fortunately it is well told, so it is easy to understand. The progression of Yvaine and Tristan is convincing. I like the imaginative and well decorated sets, and the costumes are also nice. The ideas of dead princes appearing in black and white is funny, it gives a lighter atmosphere to the otherwise tight action sequence. It is interesting that Michelle Pfeiffer chooses to do another evil character after her role in Hairspray. It is also interesting to see that all the actors use the British accent in the film, despite the mostly American cast. The only complaint I have is the ending, the final star trick should have been done earlier! 'Stardust' provides solid entertainment.",Null,1,4,13 January 2008

The dialog is so bad that it makes my eyes roll many times! Jonah Hill's character is so stupid and incompetent, contrasting with his partner played by Tatum.

Indeed, Jack Black tries his best in playing the musical instruments, pull funny faces and learns a to about rock music to impress the viewers. There are many times that the film feels like a one man show. Fortunatelym the kids also does well in the film. They are very impressive and convincing in playing the instruments.The plot is unreal but funny. Apart from being entertaining, it also touches on how people can achieve their potential when given the chance to and with proper encouragement.

The characters are all very cute, with individual characters to make them distinctive and recognisable. McQueen is charming but is relegated to the side, as the very annoying and always talking Mater is the true lead star in 'Cars 2'. There are many adventures in the film to thrill, and I am particularly entertained by the unsurprisingly large amount of car chases.

Dave is a nerdy character, and his claim to superhero power is being invisible to girls. After some funny mishaps, the real superheroes come out from hiding and do some real work. Hit-Girl is the show stealer, a super young girl doing all the super moves with courage like Rambo. Her impressive moves and almost ruthless heart contradict with her sweet and petite appearance, which makes her all the more memorable as a superhero.

The suspense is well kept throughout the film, until there is an unexpected twist which marvels me to say the least. The twist is well planned and thought out, as I see no loose ends or plot holes.

In this film, all characters appear very real, and they connect with each other and with the viewers. I like the fact that the story is delivered in a understated, or even muted manner. The pacing is slow, which gives time for feelings to develop and sink in with the viewers. The final scene is just super effective, it makes me hold my breath to listen intently on what the father has to say.

The way the plot unfolds is masterful. From an unapproachable and unpleasant old guy to a friend you can rely on in times of need is a pretty amazing transformation, and the film excels in detailing this change. The film spends almost 30 minutes to prepare for the climax, which leaves me engaged, worrying about the calamity that might happen. This sort of suspense and engagement is almost unprecedented. And when the inevitable climax finally happens, I felt this overwhelming sadness in me. Yes, 'Gran Torino' is really that profoundly moving. It is a must watch.",Null,1,5,28 December 2008

However, I find this one a lot better than the previous two, and I actually secretly chide myself for liking Shrek 3.The animation of the film is as good as usual. The various characters are given similar story time, and the cat is featured quite prominently, which I suspect is to prepare for a spin off. The fact that the donkey gets a lot less lines in this film is a bonus, because I have always found him very annoying. The story is simple in the film, but it brings out a lot of positive messages such as friendship, mutual support, and that anyone can achieve if they try. My conclusion is that it is a watchable film!",Null,0,1,10 September 2007
The Hurt Locker," Lacks suspense and commotion
","This film is about a troop of American army that defuses bombs on the streets of Iraq.For a war and action drama, the pacing is terribly slow. Watching them defuse a bomb for five minutes, or watching them drink orange juice in the desert for two minutes is just far too long. Poor character development makes me not care about the soldiers. Even though the soldiers are working in extremely dangerous conditions, the film fails to convey the adrenaline rush. They are watched by suspected terrorists, and the bombs might explode any second. However, there is no suspense, no tension and no commotion around these normally adrenaline fueled events. To make it worse, there is no background music to enhance the drama, every scene is silent other than characters talking. I simply felt bored by the static and silence around the characters.",Null,5,15,9 July 2009
No Man's Land," Excellent
","The story was set in the Yugoslavian civil war in the early 90's. One soldier from each side of the battle was trapped between the front lines of the two rivals. They cannot leave the trench because if they do, the army will fire and kill them. To make things worse, there was a third soldier who was placed on a landmine, which would explode when the pressure on the landmine is released (i.e. when he gets up from a lying down position).
This is such a sad story with plenty of extremely touching scenes. It provokes people to think that there are so many ridiculous things that people do to each other during wars. People think that by killing each other the problem can be solved. This is a highly upsetting idea. It also revealed the terrible bureaucracy of some organisations, which gives little regard for human life.Although it portrayed that the two rival soldiers had a lot of anger and distrust between them, there are times that it showed that they are also human. The two of them talked and found out that there was a girl that they both knew. I think that they were living in the same country, and they were just like any other civilians, just like you and me. They could have been living the same type of life, and suddenly friends became enemies.In this film there were no large scale battle scenes like in `Saving Private Ryan' or `Gallipoli'. However, this film is just as sad and emotionally provoking like any other outstanding anti-war movie. It tells people the absurdity of war, and how crazy people can be during war. I was very shocked to know that the soldiers in Yugoslavia really put landmines beneath bodies, so that when the bodies are cleared away, the landmine would explode and kill the dead man's friends and relatives. This behaviour is extremely sickening. The inventor of such landmines is also very disgusting. I wonder, how can people create such a sophisticated device, and use it in such a ruthless way to kill? I have always thought that, if these people who invent killing machines go to invent some other machines instead, maybe we would be living in the `future world' portrayed in the film already. Our technology would be more advanced than it is now.However, nowadays the weapons are getting more complicated, advanced, deadly and destructive every day. It saddens me a lot, because I never understood why a war has to start. The most ironic thing is that, the man who decides to wage a war against another country is always unharmed, because he sits in his office and has a large team of army to protect him. He does not die in the war. But because of his decision, millions of young men have to die.Though there is such a grave message behind this film, there is also a lighter side to it. There were a lot of scenes which are funny, and all the viewers laughed and clapped for the witty statements. For example, when the two soldiers were trapped in the trench, they were discussing which side did more war crimes. The soldier who got the gun won the argument, and the possession of the gun changed a few times. There was another scene which a soldier searched the pockets of a soldier whom he just killed, and found a picture of a naked man.Another scene which everyone laughed was that, a soldier asked the soldier lying on the landmine if he was OK. The poor soldier replied 'Of course I am OK, I got shot, and then I was unconscious, and then woke up and found there is a landmine beneath me, and then the whole world is watching me, and then I want to go to toilet, and now I was greeted by rubbish statements from my friend'.I hope this film would make people understand that wars are completely vile and barbaric, and no one would start a war again.",Null,42,84,11 June 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Funny and entertaining

However, that does not deter him and his crew to accomplish his mission.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is probably an unnecessary sequel, but I watched it anyway for completeness sake. To my surprise, I enjoyed the film and found it very funny. Jack Sparrow's lines are funny as in previous films, and got the cinema giggling in many occasions. The guillotine scene is really good, it is funny and thrilling at the same time.The story itself is just alright.

X-Men: Apocalypse," Great visual effects
","This film tells the story of how mutants become stronger, how they unite and betray one another in a fight against an ancient Egyptian God that aims to destroy the world and rebuild from ashes.'X-Men: Apocalypse' is filled with my favourite stars, and I have been looking forward to watching it. The story is a bit slow paced because there is a lot of detail to be told. How each mutant comes about, and how they befriend, familiarise and cooperate with each other is told. There is a lot of background story, and at times I think the story could be a bit faster.Fortunately, the film is filled with very good visual effects, such as the scene of the College exploding. That scene showcases the great visual effects achieved by the team, and provides comic relief in an otherwise tense scene.For the post credit scene, there is a bit of a pause between the end of the credits and the post credit scene, which made the cinema goers wondering if they sat through the credits for nothing. After watching the scene, that thought did cross my mind, unfortunately.",Null,3,9,20 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The film drags on and on
","This film tells the story of Peter Parker having to struggle between his love life, his quest for what happened to his parents, and saving New York city from crime.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' spends so much time on emotional elements, developing relationships with Gwen, the aunt and even Harry Osborn. The result is that it spends literally hours on cumbersome dialogs, and there is hardly any action. When I watch a summer blockbuster, I expect lots of action and thrills. In 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' there is almost none of that. There are only two battle scenes, and believe it or not, I was yawning even in the middle of the supposed final epic showdown.'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is just far too long. The numerous subplots that is supposed to enhance its credibility backfire big time, making the film dragging on and on. I remember liking the previous man a lot, but this sequel is very disappointing.",Null,46,98,1 May 2014
Ex Machina," A captivating and suspenseful story
","This film tells the story of a talented computer genius, who is invited to a mysterious research facility to test the latest artificial intelligence.I have heard many good things about 'Ex Machina', and it certainly lives up to expectations. First of all, the physical location of the house is magnificent. The house itself is super stylish and modern, I like it so much that I want to live in it! Another great thing is that Domnhall Gleeson looks super young and innocent in the film, which is well suited to the surprise ending. Visuals of Ava are stunning because she looks so real.Suspense is well built and maintained throughout. The plot is so mysterious and intriguing. As I was watching the film, I came up with a few possibilities of how things may end, but I was only partially right. I very much enjoyed this film.",Null,1,3,21 October 2015
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A victim of Marvel's success
","This film tells the story of the four superheroes who fight against a mysterious but powerful enemy on a silver surfboard.Superhero films, especially Marvel films, have come a long way in the past yen years. When the first 'Fantastic Four' was released ten years ago, it was just another blockbuster film. This sequel was also unable to create much shockwaves. In just a few years, Marvel films have become sensations. The films have become very entertaining, and yet every film seems to surpass the previous one. A Marvel film opening is certainly an event in itself.With this background, I'm sure if I watched '4: Rise of the Silver Surfer' when it was first released, I would have enjoyed it a lot better. The film mixes action with quite a lot of comedic scenes. It also has a lot of eye candies, which should be a recipe for success. This film has fallen victim of Marvel's success.However, I guess viewers are all very spoilt. I find the comedic scenes too ridiculous. The silver surfer look so fake that it looks like a B movie computer graphic. The plot doesn't provide enough thrills either, because a collapsing London Eye just doesn't make the cut anymore.",Null,0,1,6 August 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Cate Blanchett is astounding!
","This film tells the life of a man who is born old, and gets younger as he ages.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is a refreshing film. The interesting plot captivates viewers, despite the abundance of melancholy. It tells how Benjamin enters the prime of his life while everyone around him die off. It tells a tale of enduring love that cannot come to fruition. It tells how dreams are shattered just because a series of coincidences string together to create calamity. Cate Blanchett is amazing in her role as Daisy. She is graceful and regal as ever, and yet amidst her astounding elegance she portrays all of Daisy's emotions fully. I particularly find Cate Blanchett's performance at the end of the film moving. The melancholy in her eyes as she looks at the young Benjamin is piercing and affecting.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' stands out from the crowd because it lacks car crashes, road chases, tropical beaches and brutal fights that define many contemporary blockbusters. It may not do well in the box office earnings, but it will be remembered for years to come.",Null,0,2,4 January 2009

It is such an impressive job to have several robots transforming on a busy street, with the army shooting at them and people escaping in all directions. Apart from the visual feast, the story has a human touch as well, as shown by the emotions of robots. It has a gripping story, and it unfolds little by little at the right pace.

He gets embroiled in the middle of the cold war, and victory against the Russians is of paramount importance.I have not thought that Tobey MaGuire is such a good actor! His style, demeanor and behavior changes throughout the film and each stage of his development is very convincing. He is confident when he's young, rebellious during teenage then paranoid during adulthood. It is a compelling story, even for non chess players, as politics and sanity gets in the way of chess to complicate things. I enjoyed watching this film.",Null,0,2,2 April 2016

Both Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst are brilliant and adorable, and have great chemistry together. They are so sweet, and makes a perfect couple! The tennis sequences are exciting, and I particularly like the shots where they simulate the view from the tennis ball, being shot to the ground then back up.So, there is finally a date movie that both boys and girls will enjoy. Romance for the girls and tennis for the guys. It's a great combination. I enjoyed 'Wimbledon' a lot.",Null,4,5,29 September 2008
Magic Mike XXL," An adequately exotic entertainment
","This film tells the story of a male exotic dance troupe making a comeback at the male strippers convention.'Magic Mike XXL' is more talking and less dancing this time round, and I guess it's to do with the rising paycheck for the actors to rehearse the dance routines. Fortunately, it's still entertaining to watch, because this time the emphasis is not just exotic, but more on the sensualexperience of the ladies. It makes the ladies feel really special, especially at the membership club that Rome runs. The film is pretty non happening when it comes to exotic dancing, until the finale that is worth waiting for. The ending is far too abrupt though, and I heard people in the cinema let out sighs of disbelief that the film ends so suddenly. Overall, 'Magic Mike XXL' is a fair entertainment for the evening. It's less interesting and less exotic than the first one, but it's still adequate.",Null,0,2,25 July 2015

The story tells just how unfair and disgraceful the society back then. The scene where Katherine had a door slammed in her face was really effective. I can't imagine any of these things happening just decades ago. I wonder if people were more inclusive and embraced diversity back then, perhaps science would have advanced quicker by years simply because of the inclusion of brilliant minds who were excluded because of race.",Null,6,18,14 January 2017

The story has many engaging subplots, and some even offer thrills. The visuals are stunning, as the afterlife is portrayed to be really beautiful.

I enjoyed watching this film a lot.",Null,0,2,6 January 2018
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," It's so much fun!
","This film is about a scientist who creates havoc by inventing a machine that makes food fall from the sky.'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' is so good! The plot is adventurous and packed with fun. At times the plot is a bit silly, but it connects with my inner child again. Seeing all sorts of delicious food falling from the sky makes me smile from the inside. The film's colourful visuals and vibrant energy lifted me up so much. The story engages me so much, it makes me almost want to roll down the ice cream mountain or bathe in cheese sauce. The ending is more geared towards adult viewers, and I found it quite touching and satisfying. I really enjoyed watching 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'!",Null,1,2,4 December 2009

Lincoln," A historical drama that drags on for too long
","'Lincoln' tells the behind the scene stories of how Abraham Lincoln had to do to push the 13th Amendment through, in order to abolish slavery in America.'Lincoln' has been nominated in many categories in the Oscars, but I have not been thoroughly impressed by the film. The plot is about how Lincoln lobbied to get enough support to abolish slavery, and this means a lot of talking. The film shows one meeting after another, and there is non stop taking about boring stuff scene after scene. How they can make such an emotional topic of slavery so boring is beyond me. There is not even an action scene to balance the predilection for sedentary activities. There is one scene where Sally Field shines with her emotional outburst, but this one scene is not enough to carry the whole film. I was bored with 'Lincoln', because it is far too long and lack emotional poignant scenes. Even the supposed emotional climax falls quite flat, as the voting scene is simply chaos. The ending scene where we suddenly see why the guy took the original amendment away is not as effective as it could be, because there was no buildup to it. I was disappointed and bored by 'Lincoln'.",Null,1,3,5 February 2013
Sing Street," Enjoyable, and great music too!
","This film tells the story of a young man in a troubled family, whose parents are breaking up. He is bullied in school and basically is a nobody, until he decides to form a band to attract a mysterious orphan girl.'Sing Street' is a low budget film, with no fancy sets and no fancy clothes. However, it has this mysterious aura around it, and I like it a lot. The main character, Conor, is a very likable youngster, and I particularly feel for him because of his experience in school with the bullies and the headmaster. His friends are all very realistic and down to earth. The whole film breathes of positivity, as it tells a tale of chasing dreams, breaking out of the comfort zone and living the life you want. Maybe that's what attracts me to the film. And of course, the very nice songs that the band performs also make me like the film loads. It is unusual that I like the songs in a film about music, but in this film I find myself singing along to that song 'Drive it Like You Stole It'. I enjoyed watching 'Sing Street'.",Null,2,3,24 August 2016
Children of Men," Disturbing reminder of the current world
","This film is about a government agent becoming an unlikely hero by safeguarding the only pregnant woman on earth.The title 'Children of Men' does not give anything away, and to some degree sounds even innocent. So, the content of the film would be a shock to most viewers. In contrast to most films, the future is not bright and hi-tech. Instead, it is gruesome, disturbed and violent. There are numerous disturbingly graphic scenes of murder and execution. Random bombings, militant warfare and racial discrimination may be set in a futuristic world; however they are also present in this very moment. This parallel is highly disturbing. I think this film can serve as a reminder that we all need to stop destroying our world we live in.",Null,1,12,20 October 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," I can't say I liked it
","This film is about several broadcast journalists who were not afraid to expose the fear-inducing scam of a mighty senator.'Good Night, and Good Luck' tells a story that is not familiar to me. In fact, it is a story that is so distant to me that I don't think I care about it. Maybe it is this reason that the film failed to captivate me. I get the feeling that I have watched a documentary, but it has got nothing to do with me. Another thing that bothers me is the more than plentiful placements of cigarettes. It seems that people on screen need to have a cigarette in hand. There is even a TV advertisement for a certain brand of cigarettes in the film. Despite the well composed dialogs, I could not find myself liking the film.",Null,0,8,25 July 2010

He finds out that his invention called microbots got stolen by a masked man, and he sets out to save the world with his friends.'Big Hero 6' has fun and really cute characters. Everyone is very adorable, especially the marshmallow robot who has unconventional superpowers. The best thing about this film is that the superpowers are technologically relatively sound, at least in the not too distant future, making the heroes and the plot look a little more realistic within the fantastical dream. I also like the mash up between San Francisco and Tokyo, making the city look like San Francisco with a Japanese twist. I enjoyed the film throughout, and there is not a moment of boredom.",Null,28,42,13 December 2014

It's easy to make an offensive or lousy script out of two stupid men doing stupid things, but this film really worked. Killing an owl with a cork, trading a van for a kid's bike are just some really funny moments in the film.Both Lloyd and Harry are likable, despite their stupidity. Sometimes watching stupid stuff in a film makes me think it is a waste of time, but Dumb & Dumber does not have this problem.This film is really funny. It's been a long time since I was so entertained by a film. And this is so much better than the Dumb & Dumber brothers' recent film, 'The Heartbreak Kid'.",Null,1,2,7 February 2008

The view point is special, as we watch the catastrophic events through the eyes of a privileged 8 year old. The plot is amazing, simply overwhelmingly touching. The world through a child's eye is so different. Bruno's understanding of the 'farm' is tragically naive, but who could blame him? Vera Farmiga is great as a mother who has not been turned into a cold blooded animal, she possesses the good values that contrasts with her husband. The ending is simple but stunningly effective and devastating; it makes anyone speechless for minutes.'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' is incredibly moving.

And she is not the conventional beauty either! The plot is very good though, because it has got many touching elements. It details the reparation of a strained relationship between a mother and a daughter, which is tear jerking.I think the one thing that might be slightly lacklustre was the animation. It does not make people go wow. And the character designs are not cute or cuddly, and I cannot imagine kids rushing out to buy the merchandise.",Null,4,7,24 September 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," An enjoyable film
","This film tells the story of how several individuals of different races in the galaxy team up to save the galaxy from destruction by an evil villain.The great thing about films is that anything can become reality, and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' makes good use of this rule. We have people of red, blue and green skins respectively, a talking tree (albeit a limited vocabulary) and a talking raccoon. It has comedic moments, especially delivered by Vin Diesel who is not usually funny. The action is great, augmented by the amazing special effects. I was so impressed by the formation of planes against the Dark Aster that I felt tingles down my spine. Emotional moments are delivered by the first scene, and the final scene which references the first scene. There are all the elements for 'Guardians of the Galaxy' to be a successful blockbuster, and I enjoyed watching it.",Null,2,4,20 August 2014
The Imitation Game," A touching epic

The emergence of Joan in the film is such a gift, because she cares for Alan unconditionally, without asking for any return. I was deeply touched by her selfless sacrifice she offered Alan when Alan told her the secret. The thriller aspect of the film is very good too. The film successfully shows how there's so much at stake to crack the code, which seems impossible. The ending is so sad and moving. It's so sad that Alan Turing had to face such a horrible fate. To think that he died without any recognition of the tremendous achievement brings tears to my eyes. I really enjoyed watching it.",Null,1,4,15 January 2015
Ip Man," A great martial arts film!
","This film is about the legendary Chinese martial arts master, Ip Man, whose followers include the world famous Bruce Lee.'Ip Man' is of such high quality that I find it hard to believe. Everything from sets, cinematography, scene composition and lighting are all professional Hollywood standard. It feels like watching a Hollywood production, but even better because 'Ip Man' successfully brings the vibrant Chinese culture alive.The Kung Fu moves are fiercely real, I feel so sorry for the stunt guys when I see their face twist, their limbs bent at impossible angles and their noses get squashed.As for the plot, the initial half basically contains all sorts of excuses to fight. The second half is intensely emotional, especially for a person of Chinese descent, as it exposes historical wounds. The plot is one intense fight after another, but still contains enough emotional elements to keep non action fans interested.I am pleasantly surprised by 'Ip Man'. It is certainly the best Hong Kong film for years.",Null,1,4,10 July 2009

","This film is about 2 criminals on the run with 3 hostages. They enter a strip bar for a drink, and this changes their life forever.To sum up, this film is crazy in a good way. Only Quentin Tarantino can make a film like this. The plot is interesting, the first half is a typical fugitive story, while the second half turns into a gory horror film about vampires. The initial half successfully portrays Richie as a deranged psychopath. The second half is very gory, as body parts, slime and blood fly in every direction every second. Due to the visual exaggeration, the resultant effect is not so scary, but entertaining and at times even comedic. This film is entertaining and crazy at the same time.",Null,0,1,13 August 2007

","This film is about the Greek Gods unleashing their wrath because humans lost faith and respect for the heavens. This causes a huge war between heaven and the mortal world.'Clash of the Titans' has good visuals (I watched the 2D version), a tight plot and an endless stream of action. However, subplots are not explained so well, such as why the scorpions switches side to side with Perseus. Other subplots are just woefully neglected, such as the two civilians who claim to have specialist knowledge and volunteer to join in the battle. Io, played by Gemma Aterton, is so dispensable in the film. It seems that her only reason to be in the film is to have a girl among the group of guys. The filmmakers could have at least given her more seemingly valid reason to be on screen.'Clash of the Titans' has the ingredients of a summer blockbuster. It is alright for brainless entertainment, but ultimately it is not so memorable.",Null,2,3,14 July 2010

Though 'Jurassic World' may not have the same effect, it still provides a very entertaining and thrilling experience. The dinosaurs are as real as ever, and their brutality is well portrayed. I am also impressed by the two kids, they did very well on screen. The plot tells a cat and mouse chase that provides a constant thrill.

It is visually stimulating and rich. The sets are vibrant and colourful, and sometimes even psychedelic. The first room where there is a chocolate river amazes me! The characters are likable, especially Charlie, whose innocence shines throughout the film. The character development for the other 4 children is successful, and it makes them vile and unlikeable.

The plot is an engaging and refreshing mix of romance and science fiction. The thrill and excitement of the science fiction part is well maintained throughout the film, while the romance part melts viewers hearts. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are so convincing together, making their romance very believable. Once again, Emily Blunt puts on a particularly stellar performance, showing her impressive range of acting skills and on screen charm.

It is a lot more logical to call the police about a girl lying in the middle of the road. Instead, Lazarus illegally confine her with a heavy metal chain. The pacing is unnecessarily slow. Justin Timberlake's acting is poor and wooden, and his character is shallow and dispensible.

Almost every scene is chaotic and intimidating, reflecting what battles look like. It features constant gunshots and explosions. It is scary and intimidating to watch at first, but gets tiring as I have become desensitised by the sounds of the deadly machines. If it was not for the occasional gory scenes, I would have forgotten that each shot had the potential to kill someone. It lacks dramatic plot twists present in most other Hollywood productions.

It's a plot we have seen before. Even though it is very funny, it has lost the novelty and surprise factor, so 'The Hangover Part II' has not got the amazing hilarity of 'The Hangover'. It's a good comedy, it's just that 'The Hangover' set the bar too high, that makes the sequel almost impossible to surpass. And I was wondering why Alan became bald, and why Teddy lost his finger.

The ending is not something you could guess from the beginning, which makes the plot even more clever.

However, their faiths are severely tested when they are captured by the authorities, who torture them without mercy.I was not quite prepared for the intensity of the story. Religious persecution is something I think is wrong and is avoidable. Religions preach love and kindness, and hence I am unable to comprehend religious persecution. That's why watching 'Silence' was a tough experience. As the physical and mental torture goes on, it wears the priests down, and it wears me down too. I felt so sad for the people in those harsh and even inhumane situations. It makes viewers think whether there is a price for things you believe in. It is a chilling and profound film.

It is a bloody kill fest, showing a very downbeat and almost hopeless side of a former superhero. The story is quite slow in the first half, and actually the second half as well. I keep thinking that the film should be ending, but it just keeps going on and on. The change in the girl's behaviour at the end is quite annoying, as she should really have acted like that right in the first place, rather than saving it until so late. Is she doing that just for comic effect? I don't know, but it turns out to be annoying to me.If it was not for the spectacular performance of the girl, who looks calm, cool and ruthless all at once, the film would have been rather lackluster.

Don't get me wrong, it is still a good film. It begins with a real good fight scene in the forest. Then, there's a lot if taking, talking and more talking. That gets boring. I'm not really there to watch someone having a secret family stashed away, and I am not in the mood to care about anyone's love life. I just wanna watch the superheros fight in epic, breath taking battles that destroy cities like there's no tomorrow. Though such a scene does happen in the end, there's no saving the film.

The constant cliff hanging makes my adrenaline soar, and my palms sweat most of the time during the film! The scene of a Rob talking on the phone with his wife is very touching, because I do feel for Rob's character. However, there are many characters in the film that are poorly developed, such as the Japanese mountaineer, and I don't know much about them to care about them. If the film makes us care for many of the characters, the film would have been a sure tear jerker.",Null,1,2,2 March 2016
Friends with Benefits," Just another forgettably formulaic romantic comedy
","This film is about a top magazine executive and a beautiful headhunter being best friends, with added benefits of being purely physical without being emotional.'Friends with Benefits' looks promising in the beginning. It's fast paced and does not drag around. It has loads of eye candies from the two attractive leads. However, things start to deteriorate in the middle of the film. It descends into being just another forgettably formulaic romantic comedy. It drags on and on, trying to get serious with the emotional side and worst of all it delivers no eye candy. I just got bored. Woody Harrelson's attempt of acting a gay character is not so convincing either. I keep thinking that it is a role perfect for Stanley Tucci.",Null,0,2,27 August 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A delightful and gripping transformation of a boring book
","This film is about The Order of Phoenix, that was revived to fight against the Dark Lord.I found the book really boring, tedious and full of unnecessary anger, so I was expecting a film that was similar. I am glad to report that I was wrong! The film adaptation is absolutely delightful. The pacing is right, the scenes are full of colours and magical happenings. The jokes are great, and gets the whole cinema giggling. The visual effects are stunning, especially the scene featuring moving terraced houses. I am also glad about the fact that Harry's anger is toned down a lot. Dolores Umbridge's character is so annoying, which means that her character development is excellent! Luna Lovegood is actually adorable in the film. I find this adaptation very enjoyable, and it is much better than the book!",Null,4,9,14 July 2007
Into the Wild," A beautifully sad tale of a wild search
","This film is inspired by a real story of a young man who abandons his material life, to soul search deep in the wild.'Into the Wild' is so beautifully shot, from screen composition, location and even the weather. Everything looks so beautiful. I would have believed it was a National Geographic show.The most amazing of all, is the portrayal of Chris. He is charming and brainy. He could have had a bright future, but he walked away from it to live an unconventional life. The ending scenes shows Chris in such a sorrowful state, that it would break anyone's heart. Emile Hirsch's transformation for this film is probably the most dramatic after Christian Bale in 'The Machinist'. I feel so sad and sorry that, by the act of Chris' free will, he threw his life away. I can only hope that he found what he was looking for, when his eyes saw the last glimpse of the beautiful blue sky.Sean Penn has established himself as a master of profoundly touching films. 'Into the Wild' is one of these amazing films. It will leave you immersed in thoughts, and haunts you long after you watched it.",Null,2,5,22 March 2008
Annie Hall," Dull
","This movie is dull. There are funny moments, but most of the time they lasts for only 10 seconds or so and then vanish. I can't quite see why this movie has such a high rating. The dialogs in the movie are annoying, Allen talks about the same thing over and over again. I really can't see what is so brilliant about this film.",Null,6,15,25 July 2003
"Girl, Interrupted"," Memorable performances
","This film is about a young girl's unforgettable acquaintances after she got put into a psychiatric hospital.This film is stunning on many levels. Angelina Jolie hits it perfect as an antisocial person. She really has that charisma of being a rebellious leader, and yet she does not do it over the top. The acting by many actors is superb. It shows that they really did research on their characters and the diseases they suffer from, and portray them convincingly.The plot is great because it really highlights the interpersonal relationships inside the mental hospital. There is love, hate, jealousy, envy, respect, anxiety, happiness and despair. Almost every emotion a human being can feel is portrayed.This is a good film that you will remember for months to come.",Null,3,5,18 March 2007
Blood Diamond," A must watch
","This film tells the story of two young men who are involved in the diamond trade, one willingly and the other one reluctantly.'Blood Diamond'is a tough film to watch. There are many scenes portraying monstrous atrocities that are so disturbing. I can hardly believe that in some countries the political situation it's do unstable that people just drive around with machine guns, killing innocent citizens whenever they want to. The country and the economy cannot develop under those circumstances. It's horrifyingly sad to see such things happening, and it's even more sad to see such crimes against humanity is fuelled by people's demand for diamonds. Diamonds have such a noble image that no one could even imagine how dark the origin of the gem is.The film is well made, the script is engaging and the pacing is tight. We see the two leads depending on each other to get what they wanted, and the ultimate sacrifice they have to make is shocking. 'Blood Diamond' is a must watch for anyone with a heart.",Null,4,5,14 October 2013
War Machine," A satire
","This film tells the story of an ambitious army general, who is posted to Afghanistan to run the mission to fight insurgents. It becomes apparent very soon that various parties have not aligned their goals and missions.'War Machine' tells a story of an enthusiastic man who is stuck in a web of bureaucracies. The story unfolds slowly, and at times it looks like a satirical look at a system that is supposed to serve and protect the public. The cameos are plentiful, making me pleasantly surprised. Though I find the film a little uneventful, I can see that it parallels what exactly is happening in the story to the characters.",Null,3,5,28 May 2017
Puss in Boots," An enjoyable adventure
","This film is about a cat and an egg, who have been childhood friends, working together to find the golden goose to repay the town what they robbed years ago.'Puss in Boots' is an adventure filled with fun and action. It has cute characters and colourful animation for children to enjoy. Puss has a wide variety of facial expressions, some of which are so cute that he is irresistibly cuddly. The songs and dance provide great entertainment too. Adults will find 'Puss in Boots' entertaining too, as the plot is filled with proper adventure that is appropriate for both adults and children. The brotherhood subplot is strong and gripping, and provide the emotional elements to make 'Puss in Boots' even more credible as a film for the whole family. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,15,18,15 January 2012
Elysium," An adequate film on its own, but a below par follow up
","This film is about a man who has to get from the inhospitable Earth to a satellite settlement called Elysium.As the hotly anticipated follow up to the excellent 'District 9', 'Elysium' has much to live up to. The story tells an outcast tries everything he can to get up to Elysium in order to access medical facilities that is lacking on Earth. Though marketed as a sci-fi story, it feels too heavily laden with political messages, especially on social class divides and how the rich protect themselves so that they remain in their happy bubble. It is thought provoking in a way, but I just wanted some entertainment and be amazed by the visuals.'Elysium' is an adequate film on its own, but a below par follow up. Maybe it has something to do with Matt Damon is not quite convincing as a crook, and that his character shows no sign of ailment as the story claims?",Null,0,1,2 October 2013
Taken," Exceptionally engaging
","This film is about a former spy who uses his skills to save his kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking gang.'Taken' has received very good word of mouth, and I can clearly see why. From beginning to finish, it's full of action or thrill. Human trafficking is a tough issue to watch. By having a determined father to rescue his daughter, it gives hope to the viewers that there might be a chance for a happy ending. Therefore, the story is exceptionally engaging throughout. I am normally a pacifist, but I find myself wanting Liam Neeson to win every fight and shoot every bad guy right in the head. It is refreshing to see an action movie with a purpose, as opposed to senseless violence. 'Taken' is a cinematic experience that has to be experienced.",Null,0,1,29 September 2009
Alice in Wonderland," An underwhelming effort from a great team
","This film is about Alice returning to Wonderland after she has grown up, and faces her true destiny as described by the magical scroll.'Alice in Wonderland' is the first film I watched in 3D. When they played a 3D trailer of 'How To Train Your Dragon' before 'Alice in Wonderland', I thought 3D looked very good. Everything looked so real and so layered. When the actual 'Alice in Wonderland' film came on, I was very disappointed. The 3D was not obvious at all, especially in real life scenes. This was not helped by the fact that most of the background in many scenes were blurred, which made the 3D less pronounced. There are only a few scenes that the 3D was obvious, such as when Alice falls through the hole, or when the White Queen prepares a magical potion, but you can tell these scenes exist only for the sake of showcasing the mighty 3D technology.Though 'Alice in Wonderland' may have trademark Tim Burton fascinating visuals, it still cannot make up for the underwhelming plot. The story is less than engaging, with little ups and downs. The attempts to make jokes fall flat, while 'off with their heads' are too overdone. I cannot help but feel disappointed by 'Alice in Wonderland', which I am likely to forget in a short while.",Null,5,14,5 March 2010
The Mummy Returns," Having loads of computer graphics do not make it a good film
","This film is about the O'Connell's who are on a mission to stop the Priest Imhotep and the Scorpion King from becoming alive.'The Mummy Returns' is quite a disappointment. The plot is adequate, but it is poorly executed. Events are not so well explained, so I was quite confused about what was happening at times. However, what annoys me more is the abundance of cheesy scenes. The supposedly funny dialogs are really bad and annoying. The actions scenes are so cheesy that they make me laugh. Another thing that hurts the film is the inconsistent accents. Do they have to make every character's accent different? 'The Mummy Returns' may have good computer graphics, but it does not have the plot or direction to make it work.",Null,0,0,29 April 2009
Avatar," An exceptionally engaging and visually stunning film
","This film is about the invasion of humans into a distant planet Pandora, where Na'vis live, to mine a precious metal.Pandora is depicted with such realistic and poetic beauty, and is sculpted with such a human touch. I feel Pandora could be my home. It makes me care for the Na'vis and their world. I feel so connected with them, that I feel all their emotions. I feel so close to them that I am almost one of them. Coupled with the amazing visual effects that are stunningly real. 'Avatar' is a very strong film which makes 2.5 hours seem far too short. I watched in good old 2D but it already manages to blow me away.I seldom can enjoy or even understand science fiction movies, but 'Avatar' is exceptional as I managed to understand and enjoy it. In fact, I even concentrated on the film and loved it. The story is simple but it parallels many current affairs in our world of sky people. Through great story telling, the story engages me throughout, which is not an easy thing as the film is so long. People say 'Avatar' is unlike anything people have seen so far, and I have to agree.",Null,3,11,27 December 2009
Frank," Eccentric and different from the rest
","This film tells the story of a young man who gives up his career to join an eccentric rock band that features the lead vocalist who wears a fake head all the time.'Frank' has a weird plot, and it is so weird that I don't really understand it. The characters are all strange in their own ways, while Domhnall Gleeson''s character, called Jon, seems to be the only one who can be related to in daily life. All the other character's actions are seemingly inexplicable, such as Clara's sudden outburst of violence in the alleyway, or Don wearing the fake head to do his final act. I didn't understand why a German family shows up in the cottage either. The story is a big confusion for me, but it is still interesting to watch because of its eccentricity and unpredictability.",Null,0,1,5 October 2014
Selma," Touching
","This film tells the story of the revered human rights activist's journey to secure equal voting rights for people the USA.'Selma' tells the touching story of Martin Luther King's peaceful fight for a basic human right. The film sets the scene by detailing how African Americans were treated differentially in Alabama, and they did not get equal rights compared to whites. Martin Luther King's speeches are very powerful and effective. As Martin Luther King's movement continued, more incidents of appalling injustice are depicted. These horrific incidents are almost unimaginable these days, so it is very frightening to be confronted with the fact that these true events occurred only a generation ago.'Selma' effectively touches the hearts of viewers, not only because it is well done, but because it deals with an issue that is fundamental and close to everyone. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,1,3,22 January 2015
The Artist," Brings back a forgotten cinematic experience
","This film is about a silent film star fading, as he could not cope with the fast changing times.'The Artist' is a black and white, and has no dialog. What used to be the norm back in the 1920's is now almost a groundbreaking experience. Stripping a film of its computer effects, lavish sets and even the dialogs, 'The Artist' brings back a cinematic experience that is forgotten to the point that is almost foreign.The music is captivating throughout. The story is well presented, with much emotional depth even without the use of dialogs. George Valentin's frustration, shattered pride and depression is portrayed; while Peppy Miller's secret admiration for George is noble and selfless. The climax is gripping, and I like the lighter ending. I think 'The Artist' is a gem that deserves to win some Oscars.",Null,3,5,9 February 2012
Invictus," An amazing journey to touch everyone's heart
","This film is about Nelson Mandela and his ques to unit his country with an unconventional but winning method.'Invictus' is astounding. Through an excellent plot and strong story telling, it is very engaging throughout the entire film. The first half of the film focuses on the devastating effects of racial segregation, and I am happy to see the changes of these people shown at the end. It feels like no loose ends are left, every single scene in the beginning is catered for at the end. And I do not recall any sports scene that grabs my attention like the final scene, as if I was experiencing the match passionately in the venue. Only Clint Eastwood can make a rugby match last for 30 minutes and make it suspenseful all the way. Even the minutes of cheering at the end does not feel a bore, bu help to consolidate the mighty high emotions. I am very touched by the ending, as it is so well made. Sound and visual effects all help to lift viewers' spirits to the highest level. Clint Eastwood excels again at making and uplifting and touching drama.",Null,1,2,3 January 2010
Mission: Impossible," What a difference does 15 years make!
","This film is about a CIA agent who turns rogue after being accused of being a mole by his supervisor.'Mission: Impossible' was the cool film back in those days, when it was considered to be so high tech and so full of mind-blowing action sequences. Rewatching it after over ten years, I just don't think it is as good as I thought it was. Yes, the plot is intense with lots of twists; and yes, it has a lot of quite amazing action involving a high speed train and a helicopter. But everything else is so dated. The set, especially in that CIA room where the computer is, looks like a set for a modern day cheap B movie. Not to mention that huge computer, floppy disks (invention of the last century!), and huge mobile phones...they make the film look a lot less cool than I remembered it to be. What a big difference does 15 years make to the film industry, and to the public's expectations! We are spoiled by Hollywood, and I feel a bit sorry for the filmmakers who constantly have to come up with new ways to marvel us.",Null,0,0,27 December 2011

She meets a jazz musician who is also waiting for a break in his career.Looking at the ratings and the number of award nominations it has gathered, I thought it would be amazing. Indeed, the first scene of the traffic jam in the highway is great, as it is a continuous shot of people singing and dancing on the highway. After that, such musical number if far and few in between. The story is slow and drags on, fortunately the subplot about how they have to follow their dreams somehow strikes a chord with the audience. There is a number of songs that are good, but I expected more songs and less dialogues for a musical.",Null,4,9,25 December 2016

Hence, I had very high expectations of 'Up'. I was not disappointed.'Up' is unusual as the touching part is actually in the first fifteen minutes of the film. In a short space of time, it spans through Carl's life with images without words. All the unsaid makes Carl's life summary ever more powerful. What price would people pay to have a love and dedication like this? The subsequent movie is more oriented to children. It is delightful, uplifting and vibrant. The quality of the animation is amazing, and there are times when I felt so sure that they film a real object and incorporate it into the animation. I enjoyed watching 'Up'.

It just would not end! The pace is far too slow, and drags on and on. There are many times I think it concentrates on being visually fancy than telling a good story.

She finds documentary proof in her late sister's belongings that several priceless paintings are stolen from her family, and are now in the possession of a state museum.'Woman in Gold' is a beautiful film because it's a journey of three people working hard for a common goal for slightly different reasons. I'm impressed by the lawyer's enthusiasm in taking up Maria's case. He shows much dedication and professionalism. Maria's goal to take back the paintings is to keep memories alive, which is very touching. The atmosphere of the film is kept quite serious but not sombre, which is not easy for a film about the persecution of Jews. Overall, I think this film portrays a triumphant journey, and is very touching.",Null,4,4,12 August 2015

However, the film does not capture the same uplifting spirit. The plot is tiring and boring, with little to arouse or maintain viewers' interests. There is only enough excitement for young kids, but little for adults to enjoy. Sure, the visuals are very good, with great colours and smooth animation. The aerial scenes of Rio de Janeiro is breathtaking, but the visuals alone are not enough to make 'Rio' a success. There is something missing in 'Rio', and I got bored by it.",Null,41,77,21 May 2011

From Hell," Graphic horror film
","This film is a semi fictional account about the serial murderer in London, the mysterious Jack the Ripper.Acting is excellent in the film. The unfortunate women are convincingly tough and street like. The characters are engaging and well developed. The dark and gruesome atmosphere is portrayed well in the film. The suspense is kept throughout, and leaves viewers wanting more to unfold. The gory parts of the film are toned down a lot by using blurry shots, but they are still rather graphic. I would have liked more clairvoyance from Inspector Abberline, as this new part of the plot deserves more development to set From Hell aside from the other Jack the Ripper movies.",Null,1,2,20 October 2007
Love & Mercy," A refreshingly different type of biopic
","This film tells the story of a woman who falls in love with a very famous but mentally disturbed songwriter, Brian Wilson. A doctor is by his side twenty four seven, restricting and controlling every aspect of his life. She tries to make sense of the whole situation, and does the best she can to make the relationship work. It is refreshing that the film is not a biopic of the band's music career, but mostly concentrates on Wilson's later life when he is on a very tight leash imposed by his doctor. This makes the film way more interesting than the regular musician biopic. John Cusack has lots of screen time, with the camera focusing on him more than Elizabeth Banks. However, I think it's Elizabeth Banks who is the star of this film. I think she's a very good actress, and she continues to shine in 'Love & Mercy'. She shows all the appropriate emotions and she's pivotal in the satisfying ending. Her character is full of love and mercy, sometimes I can't help but think she stays in the relationship out of pity - but that's portrayed not to be the case. I found the film gripping and very interesting. It shows that celebrity's life isn't all sunshine as people think. I enjoyed it a lot.",Null,2,3,21 October 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," Great message from an entertaining tale
","This film is about a cowardly viking guy who is unable to fight and slay a dragon. He finds another way to deal with dragons, with unexpected results.I thought the dragons were were designed well. The dragons are scary and dangerous looking, and yet paradoxically cute at the same time. The main dragon has easy-to-interpret facial expressions which can be useful in teaching kids to read faces. The story is a little slow paced at first, but the intensity and emotional depths in the last half hour makes the whole film worthwhile. I particularly liked the message that if you understand, then you will be tolerant and can coexist with others. I enjoyed watching 'How to Train Your Dragon'.",Null,1,3,9 April 2010
Total Recall," bad
","This movie is bad! Look at the costumes. They seem to be made out of plastic. They look like the 'dress up like Robocop' outfit for 5 year old kids! They seem to be made out of plastic. Then look at the story. It is so unconvincing and childish. Then look at Schwarzenegger. His facial expression is always the same, and his tone of voice is so plain that it is like a vocoder speaking. Well, I guess that makes him more like a Robocop. This film is not for me. If you want Sci-Fi, I think you should go for 'Pitch Black' or 'AI'.",Null,2,7,12 June 2003

He enjoys the phenomenal success the brain power gives him, yet endless trouble awaits without his knowledge.'Limitless' has a very well written script. It is suspenseful, engaging and thrilling. It keeps me on edge throughout the film, wondering what will happen next, and how will the film end. The pacing is just right, and there is much excitement to keep the adrenaline going. The visual effects of altered vision when on the drug is cool, it really gives a sense of distorted perception but without crazy vertigo-inducing tricks.Bradley Cooper is very convincing as a high flier, and when the story dictates, he can look like a rock bottom junkie too. 'Limitless' is a great film that is not to be missed.",Null,1,2,25 June 2011

","This film tells the story of an arrogant and selfish prince, who is condemned to be a monster by a witch. To break the spell, he has to find true love. I was captivated by the amazing computer graphics of 'Beauty and the Beast' right from the start. How the teacup, candelabra, wardrobe and other household items come alive is spectacular. Belle looks stunning, and her character is simply beautiful inside out. This is augmented by Emma Watson's clean, intelligent and sophisticated image. The story is full of love, and it makes my heart melt. The first dinner at the castle scene is spectacular, it's very festive and grand. The ending drives me to tears. It's such a fantastical and heartwarming tale.I didn't think i would like this film so much!",Null,5,11,17 March 2017
Sicario," A confusing thriller
","This film tells the story of an FBI agent who is given a chance to volunteer to work for a mysterious group of agents to take down a drug lord in Mexico.'Sicario' tells a story of agents going into Mexico and carry out attention seeking operations abroad. The film lays out events plainly and in chronological order, but yet there are a lot of pieces missing and hence I have a hard time fully understanding the story. What I get is that Emily Blunt's character does not fully know what she is doing, why she is in the team, and she also disagrees with what the team does. She has a lot of questions about the operations, and frankly I have the same questions. As a result, the film is not able to fully captivate me, even though the plot is thrilling and adventurous.",Null,1,1,8 February 2016

In fact, it shows that all humans die one day, and it is how we view it and how those left behind cope with death that matters. Kobayashi treats the bodies with such enormous respect and dignity, which touches me a lot. 'Departures' is a film to feel. It makes you think and feel about such a taboo topic which is not normally discussed. I commend the filmmakers for making 'Departures'. It's a must see.",Null,19,19,20 March 2010

That is not to say I don't enjoy this first instalment though. The story of this film is intriguing and mysterious, with a lot of mysteries that requires a lot of detective skills to uncover the truth.

","This film tells the story of a man who stole a piece of bread to feed his sister's child. He was in jail for almost twenty years. He lives a fugitive life, complicated by his pledge to help raise the daughter of an unfortunate woman.'Les Miserables' is a wonderful film. Right from the start, it captures every viewer's hearts. It makes three hours seem like ten minutes. It is so touching and so poignant that everyone in the cinema cried like a baby. Throughout the film, the sound of tissue packets opening and closing was a permanent addition to the soundtrack. For me, I just let my t shirt be drenched in tears, as if i have had a strenuous workout. I thought the Anna Hathaway soliloquy was already with the ticket price, but masterpiece scenes like that keep on coming. I was dehydrated from all the water I lost from tears by the end of the film.It's amazing how the film can take us through every emotions there is. From the relentless struggle for existence, the the uplifting revolutionary spirit, the fatherly love and the encompassing integrity of Jean. Everything keeps emotions high, and love i find my tears literally in a freefall mode without even knowing why.

They make new friends, and work together to defend the galaxy once more.I remember that I did not quite get the hype of the first film. The first film to me was confusing, and I did not find it as entertaining and marvellous as most other film goers. This time, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is pure fun and entertainment. It is like mainstream bubblegum pop music, the whole existence of it is for fun. The jokes in this film are funny, and there are many moments when the audience laughed loudly. The family love and romantic love story lines are well developed. Groot is very cute, and I cannot get enough of Groot. There is even a credited small part from Michelle Yeoh and Ving Rhames. One more thing, there are five post credit scenes, so make sure you stay put for them.",Null,2,12,27 April 2017

I am afraid this film is not as gripping as the book. In fact it does not get the viewers interested at all. It was so uninteresting that there were loud yawns in the cinema! I think the main problem of this film is that there were too many explanations and hypothesis telling. It almost becomes a documentary with all the history lessons.

In Time," An amazing thriller
","This film is about a world in which people stop aging after 25 years old. It sounds great, except they only have a year more to live unless they earn more time.'In Time' is a great thriller that keeps me on edge all the time. The story starts right from the beginning without wasting any time, and throughout the film it's one race after another against time. There is so much urgency and thrill, keeping the adrenaline going.It is thought provoking as well. Using time as currency, the race to make ends meet is agonisingly intense. People who are poor (not much time left) may not even have time to earn more money on the clock. It highlights and magnifies the problem of poverty. The contrast between the rich and poor is very well portrayed. Another message is to live life fully, as every second literally counts.It would have been satisfying to see the film explain what adverse effect would follow Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried's actions, but I guess we have to wait for the sequel to find out. And I am definitely waiting for a sequel.",Null,1,6,13 November 2011

Such a blend may seem out of place in other films, but 'Thor' blends these ideas well. The plot is well explained and engaging. Visuals are great, especially the roaring clouds and the fight scenes on the bridge. Both Thor and Loki are superbly depicted characters.

","This film tells the story of a mute woman who bonds with a mysterious amphibious creature in a top secret research facility.The story is captivating because it portrays the mute woman's inner world fully. I can feel her bonding with the creature, out of being misunderstood, and out of being lonely. They are in the same shoes, and they break every imaginable barrier to bond. It is a beautiful story, even with its occasional violence and goriness. Sally Hawkins was great in 'Maudie', and she is equally great in 'The Shape of Water' as well.",Null,37,76,9 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," A remake of the making of a bad film
","This film tells the story of an aspiring actor who meets a mysterious man in an acting class. The mysterious man decides to take the actor under his wings, and they make a film together.The story is about the circumstances around the making of a film called 'The Room'. The film is portrayed to be very bad, to the point that it becomes good. James Franco is captivating as a man with an indeterminate accent. Dave Franco is convincing as a nice babyface. It is also pleasing to see the vast number of famous faces in the cast and cameo.I have not heard of the film 'The Room', so I kept wondering why there is a film about the making of it. Perhaps Tommy Wiseau paid for the production of this film as well? Or James Franco is a friend of Tommy WIseau? To me, there was a lot of mystery. Then, the film explains that 'The Room' has become a cult favourite, and it all becomes clear. And wow, 'The Room' will even be released theatrically in Hong Kong later this month!",Null,1,1,3 January 2018
The Fountain," Visually rich
","This film is about a relationship that spans 3 different time eras: the past Mayan civilisation, present day and the future.The Fountain is visually very rich. It has all sorts of visual effects, the most impressive being the final scenes of spirituality. The lights, the auras and the bubbles are mystic, and yet tranquil. There is a lot of imagery in the film that will probably take a lot of viewings to understand. At first, I found the film rather confusing, but slowly everything falls into place and I enjoyed the film a lot more than initially. It is not a traditional science fiction or romance movie. It is as groundbreaking as the previous Aranofsky films 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream'.",Null,1,2,13 July 2007
Zombieland," Way overrated
","This film is about two men who struggles to stay alive in a world infested with zombies.'Zombieland' starts out fun and stylish. The slow motion scenes is reminiscent of 'The Matrix'; while the way credits and rules appear and get destroyed on the screen look cool. However, 'Zombieland' has a very thin plot, the first half is so boring. The thing is, they try to avoid zombies, so there is no gore, no escaping for life, no tension and no thrill. To fill time up, they senselessly wreck everything they see which is not exactly comedic. The second half is better, but by then I get bored already. I am disappointed with 'Zombieland', and I think it is very overrated. 'Shaun of the Dead' is way better.",Null,2,4,11 January 2010
The Departed," When the good and evil cannot be distinguished!
","This film is the remake of the Hong Kong film 'Infernal Affairs'. It is about the situation when evil and the good can no longer be distinguished.This film does not feel like 2.5 hours along at all. There is not a moment of slack. Crucial things happen in every scene, and they happen for a reason.Apart from the suitable pacing, the story is also great. Though it is a remake, I can see quite a lot of difference from the original. I like the way that only the concept from the original is used, and all the details are original.Acting is great by all parties. There is romance, there is a lot of blood, there is portrayal of trust and betrayal. There is something for everybody.One minor complaint though, is that the ending (outside the lift) is a bit artificial. I can't say more, but if you watched the film, you will know what I mean.",Null,1,2,22 October 2006

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Minimally memorable mindless mayhem
","This film is about Decepticons trying to destroy the sun. Sam has to race against time to stop their plot.'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' surely has excellent computer graphics. From the destruction of the pyramids to robots fighting, every scene looks so realistic.However, the good points seem to end there. Just like Michael Bay's previous effort 'Pearl Harbour', the film drags on and is far too long. It is filled with mindless and pointless fighting scenes, as if they are fighting just for the sake of it. Most of the time I can't even work out whether the robot is good or bad. From the last Transformer movie, I thought the coloured robots are good and the silver ones are bad, but in this movie it seems the colour robots fight with the colour robots, silver ones fight with silver ones, and then everyone fight with each other. Bullets are coming from every direction, and I cannot work out who is shooting who. Just what is going on in the film?",Null,3,9,30 September 2009
The Holiday," Entertaining romantic film
","This film is about the spontaneous holidays that 2 women arranged after being hurt by their respective love.Due to the nature of the film, it involves the romances of 2 couples. It is more like 2 parallel love stories in one film, which explains the length of this film. Fortunately, the transition between the two stories is smooth and clear. Cameron Diaz is excellent in her portrayal of her character. She can really act! Kate Winslet's expression of joy and surprise when she first arrived at her house in Los Angeles is memorable.The story is predictable, but it is entertaining anyway. The fact that Kate Winslet's character derived pleasure ans satisfaction through helping others contrasted with Cameron Diaz's character. This contrast s well done and well planned, as having 2 identical love stories would be boring.",Null,1,2,24 March 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," A very slow movie
","This film is about a female CIA officer, who tirelessly pursue all leads for years to find Osama bin Laden.'Zero Dark Thirty' is supposed to be a war and action film, but the pacing is so slow. You see every detail that happen, such as putting video tapes into bags for a minute and then taking these tapes out and stacking them on tables. Such unnecessary actions are shown throughout the film, which makes the pacing ultra slow. Scenes drag on and on, and most scenes are much longer than necessary to portray what is happening. The film needs to be trimmed by at least an hour to making the pacing right. In fact, the first 1.5 hours was so boring that I had to drink extra strong coffee to stay awake. I find 'Zero Dark Thirty' even more boring than 'The Hurt Locker'.",Null,31,65,12 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Maybe more truthful but didn't engage me
","This film tells the story of Steve Jobs developing products for Apple Computers, then his subsequent venture outside Apple then back again as the Apple CEO.This version of the Steve Jobs rise and fall story may be more truthful than the other film 'Jobs', but it does not engage me because I find it full of negative energy. People are bickering all the time, with lots of fights and nasty comments are thrown at each other. Steve is portrayed to be an utterly horrible person, yet there are occasional scenes that are discordant, creating a lack of continuity with the character's personality. The ending seems like a desperate attempt to put some positivity back in, but it just doesn't work for me.",Null,14,29,29 December 2015

","This film is about a country musician who is way past his glory days. He is an alcoholic, wasting his life away until an encounter with a journalist.I had high hopes for 'Crazy Heart', thinking it would be touching and engaging. It turns out that it was neither. The story is quite unbelievable, especially Bad Blake and Jean's relationship. They meet for a few minutes and then they fall in love, despite their obvious differences in just about everything. I just cannot get into this unlikely story. In addition, lighting is a big problem. In pivotal scenes such Bad Blake and Jean's second interview, the lighting source is poorly placed. We only get to see the actors hair or back, but their eyes are covered in shadows of their forehead. It was as if I was watching a horror film, where I see a face with two black patches where the eyes are supposed to be. I was bored by 'Crazy Heart', and I don't see what's so good about it.",Null,5,11,20 February 2010
Mudbound," Not really as good as I though it would be
","This film tells the story of two men who return to a Mississippi after fighting in the Second World War.The story explores racial and gender inequalities, but it does so in a rather dull and flat manner. There is little to engage me. Granted that Ronsel's experiences in his home town are horrible, and the privileged people's behaviour are unacceptable nowadays. However, events do not drive the subsequent events. In addition, there is little that really affects the viewers until the very last scenes. The story has little happening, and then in the last ten minutes extreme stuff happens. There is little build up, and the dramatic ending becomes unconvincing.

Almost ten years later, I watched it again and found myself liking it. I was entertained by the lighthearted secretary played by Martine McCutcheon; touched by Liam Neeson's loss; saddened by Emma Thompson's experiences and felt sorry for Keira Knightley's lost chances. There is something for everyone, and everyone will find a subplot that parallels their life, and touches the heartstrings.

12 Years a Slave," A very powerful film to make you feel and reflect
","This film tells the incredibly emotional story of a free man who got abducted and sold into slavery.Slavery is one of the darkest stains in human history, and how people thought the whole slavery system could be right was completely beyond my comprehension. '12 Years a Slave' tells a story of hopelessness, fear, desolation and injustice. There are so many thought provoking quotes from the film such as 'I don't want to survive, I want to live', these are so basic and yet powerful words. There are many powerful scenes, especially the very extended hanging scene - it's extraordinary that people could just walk past Solomon as if nothing happened. Such cold blooded behaviour is incompatible with humanity.'12 Years a Slave' is a very powerful film. The use of silence and the sparing use of music augmented the emotions, giving viewers time to ponder on the atrocities of the past. It is not an easy film to watch, but well worth the time as it makes you feel and reflect.",Null,2,5,14 January 2014

After realising it is not, I readjusted my expectations and tried to enjoy the film. However, I found the plot very contrived and actually pointless. Filming the youngsters moving from one place to another is simply not interesting or fun.

They are in for a shock when their real fate after leaving the supermarket is discovered.The story itself is quite funny because it expands on a mundane facet of life, and view it from the perspective from the other side. The longing for being picked up is a bit like an orphan in an orphanage, but everything else in the film is not as pure as can be. The vulgar jokes and even normally untouchable racial jokes are displayed, And they are actually funny. The final scene is so outrageous that it made giggle for quite a while. Overall, it is a film that must not be taken seriously.",Null,1,3,7 December 2016
There Will Be Blood," Not as legendary as people claim
","This film is about a oil businessman who stops at nothing to gain power and wealth. His morals deteriorate with his increasing wealth.At the moment 'There Will Be Blood' is the top 23th film on IMDb. People hail Daniel Day Lewis as the best living actor, and this is his best performance. According to the posters in the local cinema, Daniel Day Lewis has got over 50 best actor nominations for this role alone. As a result, I have very high expectations on this film.Daniel Day Lewis is definitely great as Daniel, but I find it rather unfair that Paul Dano does not get any attention. Paul Dano is excellent as a religious leader, and he constantly impressed me with his passionate speeches. The other characters, I am afraid, are not as memorable.As for the plot, it is good in outlining how Daniel's morals decline deeper and deeper. However, I think it does not portray the consequences of his declining morals enough. It would be great to see the moral repercussions of his dirty deeds, and the emotional impact of such acts on others. The current plot only displays how he becomes increasingly corrupted, and I find this less than satisfying.The beginning speechless introduction is far too long, and the ending is far too abrupt and fast. It is disappointing that it does not portray more of Daniel and his son's relationship between his son coming back and his marriage. I would also liked to see more of his son's reaction and emotions after being told the truth. The initial 30 minutes can easily be shortened to make way for interaction between Daniel and his son. Actually the whole film can be shortened, and the pace quickened, without affecting the story.I think 'There Will Be Blood' is not as legendary as people claim.",Null,21,39,24 February 2008
Burlesque," Burlesque!
","This film is about a small town girl from Iowa who goes to Los Angeles to pursue her dreams of dancing and singing.'Burlesque' is very enjoyable on many levels. The costumes and sets are dazzling, and the dances are great. The moves are seductive but not erotic, and I commend the choreographers for getting this fine balance right. Christina Aguilera has always been known for her powerful voice, and in 'Burlesque' her voice and singing skills are brilliantly displayed.In some films, the abundance of songs can make the film like an extended music video, or is awkward or forced. In 'Burlesque' there is no such problem. The speaking scenes and singing scenes transit smoothly from one another. Another thing I really like about this film is the witty lines, they made me laugh so many times! I never thought 'Burlesque' could be so good, I think it should have made a lot more in the box office.",Null,7,7,8 February 2011

The slogan is so very apt and succinct, capturing the essence of the film, and yet eliciting imagination about the plot. 'Edge of Tomorrow' wastes no time in story telling. Within thirty seconds from the start, we are already being told about the major catastrophe. Then, the cycle happens quickly and repeatedly, yet the repetitive cycle does not feel cumbersome because of great editing. Every time it repeats, it tells less of the previous parts and adds a little more information. The story is just brilliant because it combines various science fiction elements into one, and it works very well. It captivates me throughout the two hours. I really enjoyed watching it.",Null,1,3,10 March 2015

I can't believe the name judge says 'This is what you get when girls go to college'. Fortunately, given the fact that the director is female this time, she is there to save the female species from further insults. Though the offensive and insulting elements in the first film are toned down in this film, the script is still full of cringe worthy lines that make my eyes roll like there's no tomorrow. I would rather 'Pitch Perfect 2' be an inspiring and positive film, rather than a comedy that relies on crude humour.",Null,1,5,11 August 2015

The story then tells how the enmeshed relationship between the two evolve.The music in 'Whiplash' is great. It's like going to a jazz concert, especially the finale performance at the end. For the plot itself, however, I did not like it at all. The teacher is very abusive, and dies everything he could to stir up rivalry and hatred among his students. The worst thing is that the film gives him time to justify his abuse. Abuse is not right, and the film allows abusers to give twisted reasons to justify something wrong. That really angers me. Coupled with the fact that his students keep on receiving the abuse, it evoked a lot of anger in me.",Null,10,20,13 January 2015

He soon indulges in the world of sex, drugs and luxury that few can dream of.I was hesitant to watch 'The Wolf of Wall Street' at first because of its length. It's quite amazing that three hours went by and it did not even feel like three hours. The story is engaging and fuelled with adrenaline. I am very impressed by how well Leonardo DiCaprio's character manage to motivate his staff to become successful Wall Street elites. His high energy speeches are quite amazing, and I really feel that energy and passion. The shenanigans that the elites are up to are eye opening and entertaining, as one might have expected better behaviour! An added bonus is that there is much eye candy for everybody (yes, literally everybody). I enjoyed watching 'The Wolf of Wall Street', as it has got a great plot relevant to the times, and entertaining scenes.",Null,0,7,10 January 2014

","This film is based on the memoirs of the personal physician of the Ugandan dictator in 1970's.This movie is so moving. From the beginning, the portrayal of the relationship between Dr Garrison and the president is already strong and solid. Another superb aspect of story telling is the paranoid nature of a dictator. The inability to trust anyone is shown in the film very well. Working for the president could be prestigious, but it could also be dangerously fatal. The final torture scene is simply unwatchable because it is so real, so scary, so sad. And yet, we know it was real. It was in fact the fate of 300,000 people.",Null,1,2,19 May 2007

The build up is long and convoluted, so the first hour of the film is slow and actually boring. I kept hoping that Evan Taylor would find his parents to end the film right away.The last hour substantially improves to a touching and uplifting drama, that makes you look forward to the final moment where everyone is euphoric and touched.

I find the Hobie in the ballroom scene very funny, that Hobie can talk normally outside the camera but not when the camera is rolling! The bit about Scarlett Johansson's character is funny as well.

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Pop corn comedy with a stellar cast
","This film is about an anchorman having to deal with his job being done and then taken over by a female colleague.In the first half of the film, the jokes are gross and politically incorrect. Viewers are forced to think that an erection that is easily discerned through the clothing is funny. Viewers are also forced to sit through one whole minute of Will Ferrell shouting for no reason. I became rather disappointed with the film.Fortunately, in the second half of the film, things picked up, and the film becomes much better. The attempts of trying to get Christina Applegate out of the office are funny. The scenes with the bears are funny and cute as well! Steve Carell is the gem in the film. His performance is in my opinion the funniest in the whole of the film. The way he speaks, walks and knows nothing that is going on makes me laugh. In one scene, there are a few arguing, and he joins in and shouts that he does not know what the people are shouting about. In another, he reports weather and names Michigan the Middle East. These little things are light hearted and funny. In contrast, I think Will Ferrell tries too hard and is way over the top in this film.Christina Applegate gives a fine performance in this film too. In the scene where she sees Will Ferrell being pushed into the crowd of protesters, her sorrows and regrets are portrayed effectively.There are cameos by Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller and Jack Black.

The added special effects at the beginning of the film, like the numbers of times he brushes his teeth, and how the kitchen is outlined by white lines, adds a comedic and contemporary feel to the film.The acting is excellent. Emma Thompson plays the nervous writer who has a writer's block, and she portrays the nervous self very well.

I think it is the right pace for tension and emotions to develop. A lot of emotions are unsaid, but has to be felt by the viewers. This is the beauty of 'The Reader', because to truly appreciate this piece of work, you have to be connected to it, to feel it and to be immersed in the world of Hannah and Michael.

This sado-masochistic mutilation and is deeply disturbing.The rest of the film is also handled well. The two scenes at the butcher counter contrasts sharply with each other, powerfully providing an insight to Randy's mind. It is also refreshing to see emotional elements in an adrenaline packed film.

The first half concentrates on how antisocial he is, damaging more things than necessary when he does good. A superhero that is unlikeable and hated by others is certainly not common in Hollywood. This refreshing change is overshadowed by a surprising twist towards the middle of the film. The twist is definitely unexpected and fun. Though there is a lot less action in the second half of the film, the drama makes up for it. One small complaint though, Charlize Theron does not really fit her role. She is too beautiful for it.

The story is very engaging because of the constant unknowns. The characters are divided into good and bad, while monsters are also likewise divided. This quadratic division gives characters a clear personality, and what the character represent. The visual effects are really good, as there is just no way that you can tell that the island and it's unusual creatures are computer generated. The credit scene touches me to tears.

Indeed, there is much action, in fact the whole film is battle after battle. There is very little plot, just lots of killing. The constant over simulation overwhelmed my senses and numbed my responses, preventing me from feeling the poignant ending.

I do not recall another film requiring so much thinking and digesting.Secondly, the special effects are great, in every dream sequence there are effects to make people go wow. I particularly am impressed by the explosions in the first test dream sequence between Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page, and also the anti gravity effects. These effects do not come across as pretentious or contrived, like many other films where special effect scenes exist only for the sake of looking good in 3D.Furthermore, the cinematography is well done.

Not only are they being hunted by the Germans, but also faced with the lack of food and supplies. In such desperate situations, a leader is needed. Tuvia Bielski's leadership is convincing. He maintains order, sustains hope and morale during even the bleakest times. His character is convincingly portrayed by Daniel Craig. His brotherly connection with Zus is also touching, as evidenced by the ending scene.Many people describe 'Defiance' as a war film, but I interpret it as a celebration of mankind's determination to stay alive. Their struggle to stay alive is phenomenally inspirational.",Null,3,8,17 January 2009
Lord of War," Boring
","This film is about arms dealers trying to get away from the authority, and the moral issues concerned.The topic itself is controversial, and I must applaud the filmmakers for making a film about such a topic in the first place. It is very nicely shot, it has nice scenery, nice cinematography and it also has great acting.However, the problem of the film is that it does not fall into a category. It seems not be too dramatic for a documentary; it is too plainly told to be a drama; there is too little action to be a testosterone fuelled movie; and there is not enough suspense to be a thriller. Furthermore, it really dragged on and on. I felt that I could have just watched the last 15 minutes of the film and not have missed anything.",Null,2,5,31 May 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Thrilling, intellectual and adrenaline fuelled adventure
","This film is about Sherlock Holmes and his close ally Dr Watson solving the plot of a maniacal mastermind who wanted to control United Kingdom through fear and dark magic.'Sherlock Holmes' is so thrilling! The way Sherlock Holmes solves crime is engagingly told. How he observes and deduces is simply amazing. The scene where he deduces so much about Mary is astonishing and entertainingly told at the same time. The crime solving is very intellectual, and there area also many fight scenes to keep the adrenaline up. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law work well as a team, making their characters believable. The plot is great as well.It is so engaging and thrilling, it keeps me on edge or gasping due to fear so many times. I really enjoyed watching 'Sherlock Holmes'.",Null,2,5,1 January 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," A shockingly violent and negative film for children
","This animation tells the story of a domesticated dog, who finds himself having to share his home with a big dog. They have to learn to get along, when they are captured by animal control team, and subsequently find themselves in a gang of animals who are sworn to be enemies of humans.I'm truly surprised by how dark and scary 'The Secret Life of Pets' is. It features scary animals eating each other, cute dogs having to step over the bones of other animals, and treacherous animals attacking each other ruthlessly. I can't see how this can be entertaining for children, or adults for that matter. It's a shockingly violent film with lots of negative messages. It's truly not for children.",Null,1,7,29 July 2016
WALL·E," A great film with all the ingredients for success
","This film is about a robot trash collector meeting another robot plant collector. Together they work hard to save humanity.'Wall-E' is a imaginative animation with a great plot. The first 30 minutes feature almost no dialogs, and yet it is fun enough to make people smile; and captivating enough to make people keep watching. The next hour is a captivating adventure. The animation is cute, fun and futuristic. All the cute robots and little jokes (such as the hard working janitor robot) keeps kids entertained. Yet, there are thought provoking messages for adults too. It makes a clear statement about pollution, obesity and wasting time doing nothing. The mechanically hedonistic lifestyle on the Axiom is sarcastic, and yet almost strangely resembles modern day lives. All these statements are presented without being preachy.It is rare to see a film with a brilliant plot, lovable characters, fun, humour and with a non preachy message. 'Wall-E' has all these ingredients, and is a great film for both kids and adults.",Null,0,2,7 December 2008
The Good Shepherd," Testing your tolerance to the limit
","This film is about the life an agent in the CIA. His family life is in a state, and he has to find out who is the traitor inside the CIA.The film was painfully long. I thought it was boring after 20 minutes of the film, I seriously felt I could not stand it anymore after 20 minutes. In the end, I endured the whole 3 hours of torture. There were so many unnecessary scenes, and each scene was far too long. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever happened. Despite its length, there is little that was actually told. It was complicated by the fact that the story was not linear, but jumped from one time point to another. The first 1.5 hour could have been cut from the film without affecting anything. The scenes pivotal to the film were all in the last 1 hour.I seriously recommend staying away from this film.",Null,1,3,19 June 2007
Finding Dory," The bar was to high for Dory to swim through
","This animation tells the story of a young fish who has a severe anterograde amnesia. She loses her parents, and spends a very long time looking for them.I find myself constantly amazed by the quality of the animation. Not only is realistic, it even has appropriate depth of field according to the distance of the objects from the viewers! As for the main character, I find Dory a little annoying because the amnesic jokes are far too frequent and overly repetitive. She's not as cute as Nemo either, but cute enough. The children in the cinema maintain their concentration, didn't talk or run around. However they are not overly excited either. I guess that also reflects my opinion of the film. It is an adequately entertaining animation, but not as engaging, touching or fun as expected. I guess the bar was to high for Dory to swim through.",Null,1,9,14 July 2016
Arrival," Mysterious and suspenseful
","This film tells the story of a linguistic professor and a theoretical physicist, who are tasked to communicate with the aliens who have landed on Earth. They enter the alien spaceship, and undergoes the painstaking deciphering of a unprecedented visual language.'Arrival' is quite a fresh film because the plot revolves heavily around linguistics, which is a rare topic for a film. The alien language looks simplistic but beautiful, a proof of the statement 'less is more'. The plot is suspenseful as no one, including the characters and the viewers, know what is happening. The apparent mystery is compounded by the apparent flashbacks of Dr Banks' life. The story is slow at the beginning, but is super rapid towards the final minutes of the film. It took me quite a while to work out what happened at the end, and indeed the purpose of the alien visit.",Null,1,10,25 January 2017
The Blind Side," An impressive display of the good qualities of human nature
","This film is about a deprived and traumatised black teenager who becomes a phenomenon in the sports world, with the help of a generous and loving family.'The Blind Side' maybe about uncovering Michael Oher's abilities, and reaching his true potential when given the chance. However, for me the film is more about The Tuohy's amazing generosity and unconditional loving. I am truly impressed by their acceptance of Michael, a complete stranger, without any questions asked. It is an impressive display of the good qualities of human nature. However, the actual film was not as tense, tear jerking or engaging as I thought it might be. In short, 'The Blind Side' is a good watch to remind us that humans are capable of good deeds.",Null,2,3,17 December 2009

It is a sad and thought provoking story, which begs for much deep analysis and soul searching.",Null,2,6,25 November 2019
Rango," Bad!
","This film is about a lonely pet lizard who ventures into a desert town, becoming a popular hero.I cannot believe how bad 'Rango' is. The first few minutes is already a train wreck. The scenes of Rango in the tank are stupid and annoying. The background looks so plastic and fake, which are signs of a bad film. As the film progresses, it does not get any better. The plot is poorly told, apart from some tight action scenes, there is nothing engaging or interesting. And the owl band is so annoying, they keep truncating scenes that otherwise would have moved smoothly. And the romance subplot is so unconvincing.As an animation, I have never seen characters so grotesque and ugly. Can we have 'Rango' as an entertaining animation with cute and cuddly characters please?",Null,2,16,10 June 2011
Music and Lyrics," Forgettable romantic comedy
","This film is about a 80's pop has been trying to write a song for a popular singer, only to find that he cannot write a song as he has not written in years.It is a predictable tale of Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore writing a song together, spends a lot of time understanding each other, and then fall in love. Sometimes the dialog seems very artificial and far from every day life, which really takes the fun away from the film. I really liked the performance by Haley Bennett, she is very impressive with her dance moves and her egoistic attitude which her character displays. The songs in the film are actually quite good, particularly the one that goes 'pop goes my heart', but it is not enough to make the film memorable. In fact I find the film rather forgettable.",Null,0,1,22 May 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The second half most momentum
","This film tells the story of a then famous actor who wants to regain credibility by creating his own Broadway adaptation of a play. The run-up to the opening is plagued by problems.When I realised that the film appeared to be shot in one take, my interest in it got heightened. I kept looking for spots where there could have been a break in filming. This interest didn't last until the end, however, because I only found the first half of the film interesting.The first half tells a convincing story of what happens in a Broadway production. All the actors give great performances, even Emma Stone whom I didn't realise acted so well. How the camera flows from one scene to another is quite an experience. The second half of the story gets confusing. The story focuses on the downfall of the lead character. It takes on surrealism, or hallucinations; the exact nature is open to debate. Instead of increasing my interest, I had decreased interest in the film because it is confusing and strays so much from the first half of the story. I thought the momentum from the first half is lost.Overall, I would still watch 'Birdman', mainly for the great continuous shot and for the actors performances.",Null,0,6,13 January 2015

","This film tells the true story of a bunch of people who saw what no one else in Wall Street saw. They trade accordingly, betting against the American economy. However, their profits come at a very high price to the American public.'The Big Short' has three separate story lines, as three different groups of people bet against the banks. I find that slightly confusing at first, and that is not helped by the complicated financial jargon. Fortunately, they do explain the jargon well, using entertaining dialogs by cameo actresses. The three separate story lines make the film very realistic, but I find it less engaging and captivating than other financial crisis films. However, it is one of the few financial crisis films that touch on the disastrous impact on the public, which is a nice touch.",Null,0,0,10 January 2016
The Conjuring," The scariest movie I have seen
","This film tells the most severe case of haunting Ed and Lorraine Warren, two outstanding paranormal investigators, have ever seen.I am not a fan of horror movies, but 'The Conjuring' truly blew me away. Everything from the plot, acting and the atmosphere of the film is superb. The story is believable, the family is likable and viewers are sympathetic of them stuck in a haunted house. The satisfactory ending touched me so much, and tears flowed on my face uncontrollably, which is very unusual as I was watching a horror film, and not a touching historical epic! What amazes me is that the film does not rely or even require cheap scares such as loud noises or gory scenes. Instead, 'The Conjuring' builds scariness by suspense and a very good plot. The scary atmosphere is built to and maintained at a very high level, and I had this chest tightness and the generalised unease while watching it. It is easily the scariest film I have ever seen.I was already impressed by 'Insidious', and 'The Conjuring' makes me a fan of James Wan. When his next film comes out I will surely watch it.",Null,0,3,26 August 2013
Never Back Down," A very enjoyable film
","This film is about a rebellious teenager who gets into the world of underground fighting.'Never Back Down' is no doubt about fighting, but also a journey of personal growth and forgiveness. The plot is well written and the characters are well developed, which is a pleasant surprise. I was particularly impressed by Cam Gigandet's portrayal of his psychopathic character. His piercing gaze and his cunning smiles are spine chilling to say the least. In addition, his ultra fit torso shows that he is well trained to be the champion that he thinks he deserves to be, which adds to the portrayal of his narcissistic and egoistic personality. The camera angles and the action sequences are very impressive. There are shots from a first person angle, as if the viewer is engaged in the actual fight. The fight scenes are intense, and are well portrayed by great camera work. I really enjoyed watching 'Never Back Down', and think it is much better than I expected it to be.",Null,0,1,28 February 2013

'The Water Diviner' has very bloody and violent battle scenes. The gunshots are unnecessarily loud, making viewers in the cinema jump very time a gun go off. The plot of highly emotionally charged, because it's not just about a father looking for his sons. It's also about redemption, friendship, love and determination. It's also about how lives are unnecessarily lost in wars, and how irrational people behave during war times.It's a heavy film to watch. I'm surprised that it's released during the festive season.",Null,3,13,2 January 2015
Wonder Woman," Enjoyable
","This film tells the story of a British spy, who is saved by a princess on an island with only female warriors. Together they fight against evil forces drives the great war, hoping to stop the war and save innocent lives.'Wonder Woman' is a fantasy tale, telling how a super heroine stops the great war by personally going to the front and fight. I find Gal Gadot very apt as the heroine. She is attractive but still has a fierce and formidable feel to her. The story is a little slow, and it could be edited down by a lot especially in the beginning of the film. The romance subplot distracts rather than adds, but that's just my opinion. There is a good climax, which I think is too short. It could have been lengthened and still remains thrilling.",Null,5,12,1 June 2017

His plan is in jeopardy when he develops a bond with the girls.'Despicable Me' is such a good animation! It is so much fun. The jokes are really funny, and what's even more amazing is that they achieve this humour with sparkly clean jokes. The characters are so cute, those potato-like minions look so adorable. Even if they have got only one eye, they look so cute! I really like the story too. Adults will enjoy the warm feelings of parent-child interactions, while children will enjoy, well, just about everything.

","This film is a fictional account of the relationship between the Queen and Tony Blair in the week following Princess Diana's death.This film is remarkable in many ways. First of all, it approaches a very sensitive subject in a careful way, and not criticising anybody for their actions. It displays events in a factual manner, without over-sensationalisation. The way that news archive footage intertwines with the film is seamless and professional, and there are times when I am confused whether it's a news footage or not.The sets are realistically done without being over the top. The dialogs are intelligent and direct. Acting is also superb. The portrayal of the Queen and Tony Blair are so real that they can be mistaken for real.This film is bound to stir up sad memories of people. Indeed, the film successfully evokes emotions, not only because of the sensitive subject matter but also due to the excellent plot and the tight editing.",Null,1,2,10 December 2006

There was nothing very scary, but I must say that this film kept me on the edge all the time. John Cusack did a fine job in portraying his fear, helplessness and desperation. Towards the ending, I was so disappointed by the fact that he got out of the hotel room just like that, I thought the film could not have ended worse. Then, a surprise twist revived the story and made it even more thrilling! There were several plot holes in the film, but it was still enjoyable to watch.",Null,1,2,16 September 2007

The plot flows naturally, even with references to the first film thrown in. Action starts early in the film, and keeps on going with lots of adrenaline action. I particularly like the hunt for Mills by the daughter, it is clever and the subplot even appears logical! The only thing I found illogical was that the wife woke up so quickly with a full range of emotions, after being apparently being comatose, sleeping through the sounds of hundreds of gunshots. 'Taken 2' is a action thriller that kept me on edge throughout, and I enjoyed watching it.",Null,1,1,19 March 2013

","This film is about a man who has to serve community service in a dancing school, because of the misbehaviour of his foster brothers.I was expecting 'Step Up' to be similar to other dance movies, such as 'StreetDance 3D' and 'Honey'. However, 'Step Up' does not concentrate on the vibrant energy of young dancers. Instead, 'Step Up' concentrates on the lives of the characters. There are little scenes of them dancing, and even if they are dancing they are just isolated practice scenes. For a dancing movie, the number of dancing scenes is quite pitiful. The story is not so engaging either, so I was left feeling bored and disappointed by 'Step Up'.",Null,1,2,19 August 2012
Mary and Max," An outstanding animation
","This stop motion animation is about the unlikely friendship between a young and unattractive girl in Australia, and a socially inept man in New York.'Mary And Max' is captivating and touching beyond my expectations. I never thought that an animation with bleak colours and unattractive characters would be so engrossing. The plot exposes in detail the emotional depths of both Mary and Max. It tells viewers their inner world unreservedly. Max may have an unusual personality, but his inner experiences undoubtedly strike a chord with many people. As for Mary, her loneliness and low self esteem are saddening. Her unhappy childhood evoke much sympathy from viewers. It's quite amazing that these two characters alone are so riveting and captivating, that they create waves of strong emotions. 'Mary And Max' is an outstanding animation that serves as a testament as to what friendship is really about.",Null,0,1,2 July 2011

'The Silence of the Lambs' is an intelligent thriller, well paced and well developed. It creates an atmosphere of suspense, urgency and fear throughout the film. Anthony Hopkins is chilling as Hannibal Lecter. His sick mind is chillingly portrayed, it repulses and yet captivates me. My heart was pounding, and my palms were sweating throughout the whole film. No wonder this film got so hyped when it was released years ago. I am looking forward to watch the other Hannibal Lecter films.",Null,0,1,26 November 2008

The plot is engaging, understandable and most important of all, makes a lot of sense. Events happen to echo what will happen years later (the previous X-Men films) with great continuity. The special effects are marvellous, I am still in awe by the scene involving a fancy yacht and its anchor. I really like Michael Fassbender's character, he is cold and filled with hatred. When it comes to revenge, he means serious business! 'X-Men: First Class' have many emotional elements to connect with the sensitive side, making 'X-Men: First Class' appealing to an even broader audience.

","This film tells the story of a university student who interviews a successful, young and handsome billionaire, Christian Grey. He falls for her, and they embark on a mind game of physical and mental control.It turns out that 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is more a romantic film than a film about alternative sexual practice. Christian Grey is portrayed to be super handsome and charming. He has this irresistible charisma, and certainly knows how to make a lady smile. How Christian Grey charms Anastacia to be very sweet and Romantic. An yet, he has this dark side which needs to be unleashed. The film does not concentrate on this dark side, as Anastacia is actually so good at playing mind games with Christian.

The Wolverine," A bit disappointing
","This film tells the story of Wolverine combating bad guys who targets the family of the man whom he saved in Japan during the Second World War.This is the second Wolverine spin off already in recent years, and hence this Wolverine has certain expectations to live up to. I find 'The Wolverine' to be all talk and no action. There is so little action scene, and even the ending fight isn't that spectacular. Maybe Hollywood has spoilt viewers so much by the amazing visual effects, that 'The Wolverine' looks rather underwhelming. The story is far too contrived too, especially the love story between Wolverine and Mariko. I find it very hard to believe that they would fall in love under the circumstances.As a big budget blockbuster, I think 'The Wolverine' leaves much to be desired.",Null,2,3,23 November 2013

","This film is about Batman having to stop an evil mercenary from destroying Gotham City.'The Dark Knight' have set the bar so high that it is so hard for Nolan to match it. While watching 'The Dark Knight Rises', I became increasingly confused. I was then told that it has many links with the first Batman film. As I don't remember the plot of the first one, I became completely lost as to what was happening. Even after I understood what was happening, things are still unconvincing. For example, the ending twist makes no sense to me. Why would Miranda Tate require the help of Bane to destroy Gotham City, when she is in control of the device already? 'The Dark Knight Rises' may be an entertaining film, but I could not get into the story. It is far too confusing as it tries to play the 'Infernal Affairs' game, where good guys are bad but bad guys are good. It contains elements of the first Batman movie from years ago which people would have forgotten about already. The special effects are great, but the whole film is lost in a confusing and less than convincing plot.",Null,18,39,19 July 2012

These scenes made me laugh, but overall the story is just alright. The visuals are good, the fantastical creatures are visually interesting, and the story entertains children.

I looked the scene where people in various running costumes gather sound a waterfall. That was spectacular. The story itself is very engaging, and it's great to see both traditional and superhero style fights in ample quantities. The cities are very stylish as well.

","This film is about a wealthy weapon developer making a superhero suit, and uses it to fight against evil forces.After watching 'Iron Man' I felt so disappointed. I think it is not as good as the ratings suggest. The pacing is incredibly slow for a fantasy action hero movie. It's well over 30 minutes and Stark is still developing the suit! The plot is not very engaging either, it is not exciting enough. The characters are poorly developed too. I do not find myself care for any of the characters, except maybe Stark. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow, she is such a supporting character in here, and her role could be played by anyone. Action scenes are sparse and short, and not exciting at all. The subplot about battles in Afghanistan feels more like an oppositional political propaganda, rather than the story actually needs.

The film is certainly comedic, yet it is combined with philosophical ideas which is thought provoking. Jim Carrey is great in his portrayal of Bruce. His hilarious persona shines.

Casino Royale," Be prepared to be marvelled and thrilled!
","I am quite amazed by this film. Right from the beginning, we already get an adrenaline rush by a deathly chase on a crane miles up in the sky. Then there are numerous explosions, shootings and fights. The mega budget can easily be seen, from luxurious resorts to buildings collapsing or oil tankers exploding. Something is going on every second.The editing is very tight. Each scene shows only what viewers need to see, and no more. There are no elaborate shots, as each shot only exists to tell us a bit of information. Due to this tight editing, the pace is very very quick, and the action is very fast moving. The result is that the film is very condensed, very action packed. It keeps me on the edge most of the time! The story is simple and yet has enough suspense to keep viewers interested. The ending is a bit confusing, as there are far too many twists. Anyway, the point of watching this film is to be entertained and be marvelled.

Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Fun for kids, tiring for adults
","This film is about the Sid bringing home three dinosaur eggs in order to start his own family that he longs for.The animation in 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' is very good. The initial scenes which Sid finds the eggs are impressive, as the shadows and the amount of light on the eggs changes when Sid moves. The scene where an animal falls into water looks actually perfectly real and not animated.However, the content of the film was a major bore. The same supposedly funny material keep coming up, as if the filmmakers ran out of jokes. I got so tired of squirrels chasing nuts and animals falling from height. The jokes may be entertaining if you do it once, but not when repeated thirty times. In addition, most of the entertainment is geared towards young children, which means there is not enough material to keep adults interested.I find 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' tiresome and boring. I was waiting for it to end about half way through already.",Null,6,11,10 August 2009
La Vie En Rose," A mesmerising, powerful and atmospheric biopic
","This film tells the turbulent life of the late singer Edith Piaf.It's amazing how 140 minutes feels like 60 minutes. Though I didn't know about Edith Piaf, I was completely mesmerised by this film. Every single scene is made meticulously and makes me crave for more! Despite the non linear pacing, the story is very clear thanks to remarkable and distinctive images of Edith Piaf in various stages of her life. Marion Cotillard is absolutely phenomenal, and it would be a crime if she did not win the Oscars. She could be insecure and rebellious; mature but bossy; fragile and very ill; demented and hopeless. What other film could showcase acting skills that feature every emotion on Earth? Two remarkable scenes are when Mômone got removed, and after she was shown looking for a watch. These scenes are simple heartbreaking. Marion Cotillard does it so well, that connects with the viewers and evoke much emotions.Her turbulent life is also told in a powerful way. It is heartbreaking to see her having one misfortune after another. Her lonely childhood, was filled with rejection and hatred. She was robbed of love and friendship. In her adult life, she was robbed of her health and dignity. The ending unfolds more tragedy in her earlier life, which evokes even more sadness and sympathy.'La Vie En Rose' is a mesmerising, powerful and atmospheric biopic. It is a must see even for non music lovers.",Null,1,3,19 February 2008
Bull Durham," A fairly engaging story
","This film is about the happenings of two baseball players' year in a minor league team.'Bull Durham' is only fairly engaging, which is a surprise as it is a sports movie. The reason is that it is not really about baseball. In is in fact about two baseball players and a woman with a thing for baseball players. Hence, the poignant scenes of victory are not prominently seen in 'Bull Durham'. Fortunately, the three main characters are equally interesting. Susan Sarandon is particularly memorable as a temptress, her desperate exclamation after her failure to seduce Tim Robbins is intense and also comical at the same time.",Null,0,2,13 May 2011
Before Sunrise," What a bore
","This film is about an American man meeting a French girl on the train in Europe, and the spontaneous day they spent with each other in Vienna.I have heard from so many friends that this film is very romantic. However , I found it really boring. The plot is unbelievable. Would a girl really get off the train with a total stranger? They don't even know each other's names yet at that stage! I find the lines are twisted and winding. Ethan Hawke's character tries hard to be philosophical and smart. It would have been good in a drama, but in a romantic comedy, I find that annoying. There is too much dialog in the film, and there are many times I wish they talked less.This film disappoints me given the good word of mouth it is getting.",Null,1,11,12 August 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Fresh and vibrant work from Woody Allen
","This film is about two American tourists meeting a charming and free thinking artist in Barcelona. Their love lives are never the same again after a series of entanglements.Vicky and Cristina are very different people with opposite ideals. And yet, they somehow fall for the same guy, wrecking the lives of all three of them. This entangled mess is well developed and engagingly told. It gets me interested to know what will happen next, and I feel for all the characters. I feel for Vicky's confusion, Cristina's jealousy and Maria Elena's neurotic outbursts. Together with the great background music and vibrant visuals, 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a refreshing work from Woody Allen. It lacks the constant babbling dialogs that appears in many Woody Allen's films, but it still feels like a Woody Allen film. I enjoyed it from start to finish.",Null,0,2,3 January 2009
Sweet and Lowdown," A major disappointment
","This film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.I was expecting the usual Woody Allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but 'Sweet and Lowdown' failed to provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. He is so unlikeable, that I do not want to now about him, or care about him. I wonder why a film about him has to be made. The pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore. Even Sean Penn's great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable level.I like Woody Allen's films a lot, but 'Sweet and Lowdown' is a major disappointment.",Null,3,5,30 June 2009
Pitch Perfect 3," Brain off entertainment
","This film tells the story of a group of female singers, who go on a European tour to entertain the American troops.The story is pure brain off entertainment.

I find Rebel Wilson's character annoying though, as she constantly delivers lines with sexual innuendo.",Null,0,1,22 April 2018
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Intense and well told
","This film is the sequel of the Oscar winning film, Elizabeth. This film chronicles the events between Queen Elizabeth I and Sir Walter Raleigh, and the tension between England and Spain.The fine costumes are extravagant and lavish. Together with the well scouted locations, the film easily takes me back to the times when Queen Elizabeth I lived. Cate Blanchett is excellent as Queen Elizabeth I again. Camera work is good, and most shots are well composed. However, I find the shots that look through architectural features too excessive. There are several scenes which the architectural features take up most of the screen, and we only get a glimpse of what we really need to see. An extreme example is when Queen Elizabeth I kisses the ailing man towards the end of the film, we only get to see the scene through a hole. On the whole, this film is intense and the plot is told well. I can only admire Queen Elizabeth I for her firm belief in herself.",Null,1,2,6 January 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," Great acting
","This film tells how Walt Disney convinces the unmovable Mrs Travers in selling him the movie rights of her famous book 'Mary Poppins'.I had no idea who Mr Banks was before I watched the film, nor have I read the book in question. However, the two main characters, played by Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, are both very interesting and captivating. Tom Hanks as Walt Disney is such an amicable father figure. He has so charming and wholesome. Emma Thompson as Mrs Travers is also interesting, as she is so negative and antagonises everything she encounters. Her character is so bitter, that it would not be fun to be her. Walt Disney and his team tries to break through her icy heart, but with no success. The plot itself is just alright, but the acting is very enjoyable.",Null,1,4,26 December 2013
Jojo Rabbit," Quite different from the rest

Beowulf," Contrived story and very bad graphics
","This film is about a hero called Beowulf in ancient Denmark, who kills monsters that plague the kingdom.I was hugely disappointed with the animation. Many scenes are so badly faked that they hurt my eyes. For example, the scene where a soldier challenges the old Beowulf on the beach, the whole scene is so fake that it looks as if it is lifted off a badly animated video game. Lighting is bad and uniform, movements are unconvincing and faces look like plastic mannequins.The bad animation already turns me off. It is not helped by the ultra simple story line. Many scenes are laughably contrived, such as John Malkovich's character challenging Beowulf and then makes up.Or old Beowulf's girl begging Beowulf not to go, and the girl runs away after Beowulf refuses.People say 'Beowulf' is visually fantastic and fascinating. My friends were thrilled about the film, but I did not feel the same way.",Null,1,2,12 May 2008
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Entertaining but nothing exceptional
","This stop motion animation is about a clever fox who stopped stealing for a living after his son was born. He steals again many years later, with drastic consequences.'Fantastic Mr. Fox' has elements to keep people interested. I like the abundance of funny scenes, as it works magic in the film. Visuals are nice and the characters are likable to look at. I find the plot quite straight forward, and even a little too plain in some parts. There are little ups and downs to keep the thrill going. Or maybe I am expecting too much as it is a children's story.I have always had respect for stop motion animations because it takes so long to make just a scene. 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an alright animation to spend an evening, but I do not find it particularly memorable.",Null,9,18,17 January 2010
Thor: The Dark World," An entertaining blockbuster
","This film tells the story of Thor and his battle against the dark forces who are fighting for the control of the source of evil power called Aether.'Thor' is visually impressive, with many scenes of epic battles in impressively portrayed imaginary worlds. I was also impressed with the scene where Jane Foster floats in the air, emanating rents and blackness. It's a scene lifted out of a horror film but works so well in this story. I liked the London in crisis scenes too. The jokes in the film don't really work though, they aren't so clever and aren't that funny. Nonetheless, the film still entertains and delivers marvellous visuals, making it a more than adequate blockbuster.",Null,0,2,9 December 2013
Lucy," visually appealing
","This film tells they story of a woman who unknowingly becomes a person who can access 100% of her cerebral power, after a chemical substance is implanted into her.'Lucy' has very cool social effects. There is quite a bit of such footage of weather and nature, in keeping with the theme of evolution. The final scene where Lucy accesses her college cerebral power is very amazing. I like the plot a lot as well, as it's very imaginative about what happens when people can use their brain completely. Though it is a bit far fetched, it's very entertaining to watch. I find 'Lucy', captivating and visually appealing, I very much enjoyed watching it.",Null,16,35,22 November 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Beautiful visuals
","This film is about a young boy scout running off with his teenage girlfriend on an isolated island. Other boy scouts and local residents search for them under terrible weather conditions.'Moonrise Kingdom' has beautiful visuals. The scenery is always beautiful. Sets are thoughtfully presented, such as scouts marching in the background wen main characters are talking, the distinctive tree house location etc. The retro colour scheme fits the film very well too. The two teenagers' performances are very good, they look so pure and natural. The stellar cast of adult characters stand out as well, I particularly like Edward Norton's master scout character. Tilda Swinton is not immediately recognisable, but she is a memorable character as well. 'Moonrise Kingdom' is an accessible Wes Anderson film. It is mainstream enough, while still maintaining its quirkiness.",Null,0,0,4 January 2013
Midway," Very good
","This film is spectacular in its visuals, portraying the skies in a manner I've not imagined. The story is great, as it concentrates on the battle and on the emotional side of the soldiers as well. It is not just brute force, violent fights or acting tough. It shows the soldiers having a human side as well. Tears flow down my cheeks when I see the predicament they are in. In addition, the film also shows the enemy side as well, which makes it more balanced. The characters are portrayed very well, and I really connect with them. Furthermore, it doesn't come across as too patriotic, which appeals to foreigners like me.",Null,2,4,17 November 2019
The Sixth Sense," Engaging but overrated
","This film is about a child psychiatrist helping a distressed young boy who sees dead people.'The Sixth Sense' has always been regarded as an extraordinary film by many. I have to say I enjoyed watching it, but I find it rather overrated. The thing that strikes me the most is Toni Collette's great acting as a troubled mother. She portrays her stress and distress well. For the plot itself, maybe it's because I already knew the ending when I watched it, I did pick up on the clues related to the ending twist. 'The Sixth Sense' is enjoyable and engaging, but I did not find it as groundbreaking as other people think.",Null,0,1,16 December 2008
RED," Unfunny and incoherent at times
","This film is about several retired secret agents who are escaping from the CIA, as someone from the authority wants them dead.'Red' is certainly over hyped. I cannot see what is so great about this film. The story telling is quite poor, with scenes incoherently pieced together, especially the scenes in the beginning. After watching it for half an hour, I still struggled to understand what's going on. As the film progresses, the plot becomes slightly clearer, but is still messy and unclear at times. It is supposed to be funny, but I do not find any scenes funny. Indeed, John Malkovich's character is annoying and over the top stupid. Helen Mirren is under utilised in the film, and she does not appear so natural in handling firearms. Julian McMahon looks far too young to be a vice president. When the characters themselves are not believable, how can one enjoy the film? I think 'Red' is an unfunny, forgettable and a disappointing film.",Null,2,8,22 October 2010
Flight," An engrossing character study

After the disaster, 'Flight' looks at how the pilot copes with the life change and his alcoholism. It is an interesting character study, detailing the psychological changes he goes through. The pace may be a bit slow, but we can see clearly how the pilot goes from one stage to another. The ending is a satisfying turn of events, showing how integrity rises above all. I liked watching 'Flight', and with tighter editing it would have been even better.",Null,2,3,5 February 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Ending on a high note
","This is the final Harry Potter film, where Harry Potter and the gang destroys the remaining horcruxes and battles with Voldemont.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' signifies the end of a decade of Harry Potter films. Fortunately, it is a great film, ending the series on a high note. The pacing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is fast, meaning action happens almost non-stop. Watching Harry Potter and the other wizards in Hogwarts in dire danger from Voldemont is very engaging. The special effects are very smooth and realistic, and one can only be marvelled by the complexity of the special effects in the battle scene. The only complaint I have is the underwhelming 3D effects. In most scene the 3D is barely noticeable, and there is only one scene involving fragments scattering in the sky that the 3D is spectacular. So watch the 2D version to save money.",Null,0,2,16 July 2011
Unbroken," A surprisingly effective film

I had to wait an hour before that happens! The hardships described and depicted in the film are quite horrifying for everyday standards, but not when compared to other similar films, such as 'The Railway Man'. The delivery of the story is quite good though, making the film very touching in the end. The theme of unbroken can be emphasised a bit more, not just in the scene where the athlete lifts a plank. I was also impressed by the physical transformation of the actors to a state of emaciation. I liked the film overall.",Null,0,1,7 June 2015

It is gory and graphic in portraying deaths, so it is definitely not for the faint hearted. The plot is sound and logical, which coherently pieces up the fate of the high school friends. I also like the fact that there are a lot of scenes that are not intense, which provides viewers some space to catch some breath.Unlike 'Scream', 'Final Destination' ages well, and still deliver the intended suspense and thrill so many years down the line.",Null,0,0,18 February 2012
The Purge," I wish it was a pure slasher movie
","This tells the night of a rich suburban family, when all crime is legalised for twelve hours.'The Purge' may have an interesting idea, but I am afraid the whole film is quite poorly executed. The plot really annoys me, as things happen in a contrived manner. For example, how could the kid have the security code? Why would a group of people target one homeless man, when there are may around? And in times of such desperation, one must fight for survival. Having a battle of conscience is not going to help.In addition, people are clearly abusing The Purge, so how could the economy and the harmony of the remaining citizens not be hurt by it. The plot is so unbelievably contrived at the end, it has lost all its credibility. Though it is thrilling and exciting, I think it is better positioned as a slasher movie without the subplot of battle of conscience.",Null,0,2,22 October 2013

In fact, I find everything about this film to be wrong. First, the two judges keep saying very mean things about contestants, and on many occasions say degrading things about female contestants. They just don't seem to respect women.Second, all the ethnic minority characters are portrayed as freaks. The Korean roommate is super rude, the Asian singer is mute, and the Negro singer is lesbian who takes advantage of every situation like a nymphomaniac. Third, they are an acapella group, yet they have background music when they sing. The story is not inspiring or gripping either.

","This film tells the story of the victors in previous Hunger Games getting chosen to take part in a special edition of the Hunger Games.The film wants to achieve many things, including the obvious action thriller, but also achieve an emotional subplot that highlights the humanity of the lead participants. Though I like their humanity and the touching things they do, I think this emotional element distracts the action subplot, making the film less exciting. Moreover, the love subplot is very contrived. The film also spends too much time telling the story before the game, and little time during the game. Overall, I enjoyed the film but it's a little overrated.",Null,1,9,2 December 2014

","This film tells the story of a young soldier who valiantly helps on the battle against the most feared monster in history.'Godzilla' is really a big surprise. It's really intense throughout, keeping sidebar and thrill at a high level. The initial build up is already really good, the scene where the nuclear power plant collapse is very memorable. There's already s lot of emotions from the start, and emotions keep soaring high as soldiers valiantly fight the epic battle that never seem to end. The visual effects are jaw dropping and awe inspiring. There were many moments that I could not find tone to breathe because the destruction is so massive.'Godzilla' is an excellent adventure, delivering thrills and emotions almost non stop. I normally have no interest in monster films, but I love this one.",Null,8,16,16 May 2014

It has a constant stream of great music that lifts the atmosphere of the film. The dances are elegant and enjoyable to watch. The fun script also helps the entertainment value. The three student all have different reasons why they start dancing, and it is satisfying to see them carry through the quest to learn dancing. The ending provides a happy closure for all characters, which is obviously a must for a comedy. 'Shall We Dance' is a good feel good movie, perfect for relieving stress.",Null,1,2,22 July 2010
Looper," An tightly packed science fiction plus action thriller
","This film is about a young man who kills people from the future who are transported back in time for him to kill.It is easy to have loopholes in time travel stories, but 'Looper' deals with the science well. It has no major pitfalls, except the fact that it does not address the creating of a parallel universe when the past is changed. Anyway, I can easily overlook that and enjoy the story as it is, because it is an interesting science fiction plus action thriller combined into one. The plot is confusing at first, and I also got confused because Joseph Gordon Levitt does not look like the usual Joseph Gordon Levitt, which is distracting. Once I got into it, I think it is an action packed, fast paced action thriller. The ending is a little predictable, but I only correctly guessed it just before it happened. 'Looper' provides adequate entertainment, and I enjoyed watching it.",Null,0,1,15 February 2013

Even the lay public can relate to the dangers of the unknown, so there can be nothing as to careful. The plot slowly unveils itself at first, then quickly becomes an intense cat and mouse chase, and a fight for survival. The sense of impending death, and the hopelessness is not explicitly stated, but it is palpable. The many famous actors in the film makes it pleasant to watch too.

50_50," A touching emotional journey
","This film is a semi-serious account of a 27 years old man's life with cancer.'50/50' takes a semi serious approach, with lighthearted elements to make it funny. At the same time, it still respects the gravity of the situation, and is not over the top with fun or drama. This fine balance is very well done.All the main characters convey much emotions in the film. The girlfriend's inability to cope, the best friend's supportive attitude and the mother's pain are all so well portrayed. The best of all is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's change in emotions, from one extreme to another when reality finally hits.'50/50' is a touching emotional journey through the battle against a serious illness, and is simultaneously entertaining within its suitable boundary.",Null,1,3,26 November 2011

A fake documentary is not new, but one on lives of vampires is certainly new. It is really fun to watch. I love the accents of the vampires! The whole plot is hilarious, especially the fact that they are portrayed as humans. It's like they are actually nothing to be scared about, because they still have to take part in flatmate meetings and wish the dirty dishes! Stu the human is very funny as well, because he is so wooden despite being in such a bizarre situation.

The only catch is that he becomes disfigured from head to toe.'Deadpool' is really funny because it makes fun of himself and of all superhero films. It is almost like a parody of superhero films, but in a good way. The jokes are super funny, I loved the joke about the studio having no money to fill up the house. The 300 viewers in the cinema laughed hard and clapped hands on many occasions. When the film ended, people even clapped, which is the first time I see it happening in Hong Kong.

Cloud Atlas," Too confusing for me
","This film tells the story of several individuals, who are in different points of the time and space continuum. Though they might be years apart from each other, their stories are not as different from each other as expected.So 'Cloud Atlas' is a literary wonder, but when translated to the screen, it seems to be very confusing. It tells many stories in many different time points, and they share some similarities but are not identical. An hour into the film, I thought it was about the universality of human experiences, and how karma affects past and future lives. Then I realised that it wasn't about these themes, then I got increasingly lost. The story of Tom Hanks and Halle Berry confuses me the most. Maybe I'll have to read the book first before watching the film.",Null,1,3,10 April 2016
300," Captivating and breathtaking!
","I went to see it in the cinema due to all the hype around this film. And I can say I did not make a mistake in deciding to watch this film.Right from the first minute, the film is already very intense. The strong emotion of non-submission and the determination to fight until the last breath is vividly portrayed in every minute. Gerard Butler's heroic shouts are already enough to get my adrenaline pumping.Few films can capture my complete attention right from the start and maintain it to the end. The stylish action certainly captures my attention. The special effects in the film are stunning. In very few other films can you see such brutal and yet stylish manoeuvres. The graphic scenes of soldiers being beheaded, and limbs flying around like confetti strips adds to the enormous tension.Some say that the plot is thin. I do not agree on this. The plot is simple, as it is about the 300 soldiers' fight to defend their country until the end. However it is not a thin plot. It contains so much emotion, and highlights the humankind's determination to survive and persevere.I seldom give a 10, and I think this film deserves it.",Null,5,13,18 March 2007

The graphic violence is so over the top that it becomes funny. The fireworks scene makes me laugh out loud! I like the characters in the film, I think Colin Firth is very convincing as a gentleman and secret agent. His protégé is good as well, he transforms from a street kid to a gentleman with killer instincts. The numerous action scenes are very imaginative, they even have balloons going up into space, which is quite unexpected. I enjoyed watching this film.",Null,1,6,14 June 2015
The Hangover Part III," Sometimes fun, at times flat and ultimately forgettable
","This film is about the gang who has to bring Alan to a mental facility. On the way, they get kidnapped, and their lives are endangered.Maybe it is because ''The Hangover Part II' was widely criticised as a carbon copy of 'The Hangover', 'The Hangover Part III' tries to be very different compared to the first two. The plot is loosely related to the first two films, but becomes a silly gangster comedy. The plot is no longer about mishaps after alcohol, and hence people expecting such humour would be hugely disappointed. It contains many one liners that made the whole cinema laugh, but they are not enough to carry the whole film. The plot is senseless and annoying at times, especially Alan whom I have never really liked.Maybe the filmmakers realise that the plot is a radical departure from the first two films, the during credit scene provides some familiarity. That scene is hilarious, but a little far fetched. Overall, 'The Hangover Part III' is sometimes fun, at times flat and ultimately forgettable film.",Null,1,3,3 June 2013
Easy A," A fun and enjoyable comedy
","This film tells how a school girl uses rumours to advance her cool factor, but her publicity stunt spirals out of control.I thought 'Easy A' was about easily getting A grades, but that is far from what it actually is. The school girl in question bows to social pressure, pretends to be promiscuous in order to be cool, and to help some disadvantaged schoolmates along the way. How she helps Brendan in the bedroom is so hilarious, I laughed hard! In just a few days, her world is turned upside down, she feels differently about herself and everyone else feels differently about her as well. For a comedy, Olive's emotional roller coaster is portrayed convincingly. I also liked her open minded and supportive parents, although they have minor roles in the film, they provide a safe haven for her to grow up and become independent.'Easy A' is a fun teenage school comedy with a great moral story. It even tells how social pressure makes us do regrettable things. It's easy for people to relate to the story, and that's a big contributing factor to 'Easy A' being a fun and enjoyable comedy.",Null,4,5,8 August 2013

They plan the impossible heist to steal that money.'Fast Five' sees 'The Fast and the Furious' series of films transitioning from films about fast cars and furious drivers, to adrenaline pumping action heist films. The transition is very successful, as the story is full of intensity, adrenaline and thrill. I am still in awe of the extended car chase scene around Rio. The scenery is so very beautiful.

In 'Honey', it has a coherent and cohesive story which successfully blends the music and stars into the film without being contrived. Dance moves are great, as the dancers do show their enthusiasm and youthful energy. I liked looking at the dance scenes.

","This film tells the story of a team of scientist who heads into a strange zone to investigate the strange occurrences.It is very captivating story because it is just so mysterious. Right from the start, the story is suspenseful, and the suspense is superbly maintained throughout. There is just no knowing what will happen next. I find myself holding my breath for many times.

Minions," So fun and cute!
","This animation tells the story of the minions trying to look for an evil master in order to keep up their morale. They find a villain called Scarlet Overkill, and the minions are tasked with stealing the crown from the Queen.I saw the trailer and I thought the 'Minions' was so cute. After watching the film, I thought it was even cuter than I expected! The plot is silly but fun. The minions are simple in design, and simple in their thoughts, but they manage to create the funniest situations. There are some jokes that made me laugh out loud, such as the usage of a teapot inside a police car. I also just realised that the minions are not talking unintelligible gibberish - it is actually a mix of languages, which I spotted Spanish, German, Mandarin and Bahasa. I enjoyed watching this animation, it is 90 minutes of brain-off entertainment.",Null,8,16,1 July 2015

Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," An enjoyable film for all ages
","This animated film tells the story of several zoo animals who are lost in Africa, and they have to pretend to be circus animals in order to go back to their zoo in New York.I am glad to say that this instalment is fun, warm and not annoying at all. I like the bright and vibrant colour scheme, and I like the numerous jokes as well. There are subplots for adults to feel and reflect upon as well. It is an enjoyable film for all ages.

A Walk to Remember," Refreshingly told love story
","This film is about the unlikely first love between a reverend's daughter and a young man who is up to all sorts of mischief. After their chance meeting, their lives are changed forever.I really liked this film. Despite the predictable story, it is told in a refreshing manner. Character development is great. Both the main characters change subtly, bit by bit, after being influenced by each other. Cinematography was good, and the cameraman's skill is already fully shown at the first scene, where the camera moves in different directions and at different speed to focus on various things that are going on in the youngsters gathering.I particularly respect the fact that Mandy Moore is portrayed wholesomely, without having to resort to using skin to attract other boys (or the movie goers). There was even not a sex scene, which I have no complaints about. This down-to-earth girl-next-door is attractive without being sexy or glamorous. Sex does not equal love. I think it is an important message to be told to young people.This movie is touching and I do recommend it!",Null,0,1,15 July 2006
Inside Llewyn Davis," Going nowhere
","This film tells the story of a young struggling folk singer, and his eventful week in New York.'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the title of the album by the title Character, Llewyn Davis. It is not creating ripples across the nation in the 1960's USA, and he struggles to make ends meet. He crashes in various friends' places, a few days at a time. His encounters with these friends are eventful, but they do not seem to get anywhere. I thought Llweyn Davis was right back where he started after almost two hours, and the big circle he travelled was not even entertaining.In a plot driven film like this, it is crucial to grab the viewers' attention - but there was little to grab mine in 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. Fortunately, the songs were very good, and they did the songs justice by playing them in their entirety.",Null,1,2,17 February 2014
Sin City," Not my type of film
","This film tells the story of the people in Sin City, and their violent and corrupt ways of life.I wondered what a graphic novel was, it turned out it is a film with a lot of narration like a novel has. Instead of describing with a scene, they describe with words. It's an interesting concept, but the story doesn't work for me. The violence is so over the top that it made me laugh. The scene of a man with an arrow through his body is completely hilarious, and I'm not even sure if that's the intended effect.The black and white effect with some specks of color may be cool at the time of release, but by now I have seen it all before so I am not as impressed with it as I expected. One thing I was very impressed with was Jessica Alba's dancing. I knew she could dance from the film 'Honey', but this time she can really dance amazingly.'Sin City' will appeal to some, but not to me.",Null,1,2,21 August 2014
The Ugly Truth," An entertaining romantic comedy
","This film is about a TV producer who has serious personality clashes with the new host of her show.'The Ugly Truth' is a nice romantic comedy. Sometimes a battle between the two sexes can be annoying and even offensive, but in this film the battle is fun and entertaining. Katherine Heigl is natural and authentic in her role. She is confident and charming, yet funny at the same time. She is very believable as a controlling producer, without being uptight. She has great chemistry with Gerard Butler. Some jokes in the film are funny, and a scene in a restaurant is riotous! 'The Ugly Truth' is an entertaining romantic comedy. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,0,5,2 October 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," Quite entertaining
","This film tells the story of five friends going to a remote cabin for a holiday. Little do they know that there is something very sinister going on in the cabin, and soon they find themselves fighting for their dear lives.'The Cabin in the Woods' looks a bit like a low budget film because of the harsh lighting and the way visuals are presented. However, it has Chris Hemsworth and Richard Jenkins in it, so it can't be a low budget film. Sigourney Weaver appears right in the end too, which is quite a pleasant surprise for me! As for the story, it is interesting and entertaining. The gory horror scenes are so over the top that they are comedic at times. It is a bit wrong to chuckle at these scenes but I cannot help it. Overall, the film is certainly different from other horror films, and is quite entertaining.",Null,1,2,13 March 2016
Spectre," Just follow the movie logic
","This film tells the story of James Bond trying to stop an underground terrorist organisation from taking over the world's secret intelligence service.'Spectre' opens with an intense scene in Mexico City, where buildings get blown apart and dangerous fights happen in a helicopter. After that, the story is a bit slow but still engages my interest. I recall that 'Casino Royale' was so quick paced, scenes were so short that it was like an attention deficit fest. In 'Spectre', the director takes time to tell and build the story. However, the story is not so strong, as the villain is a diffuse organisation that is so mysterious, that viewers are often left in the dark. There is a funny and memorable scene that shows James Bond taking a watch from Q, and this scene is used in the watch commercial before the film, which is a nice touch! After watching the whole film, I think 'Spectre' is a good film but there are too many illogical moments that makes you wonder how did that just happen. To enjoy it, just follow the movie logic, and don't question anything in the film!",Null,1,9,6 November 2015
Joy," The new Erin Brocovich!
","This film tells the remarkable story of a woman who endured much hardship in her life, giving up her dreams in the process. She works hard to turn things around, but things don't turn out as hoped.'Joy' is such a remarkable film. It's inspirational to see a young woman fighting against all odds, while being super resilient along the way. The story is so engaging because right from the beginning, we see Joy being faced with adversities, but she still stands up against the harsh world. Suspense is well built, especially the scene where Joy gets a phone call and has to rush back to the house. I find myself holding my breath, counting who is missing from the screen and trying to guess what happened. Joy has that quality that make viewers care about her, and every bit of me wants her to succeed. This is easily one of the best inspirational film since 'Erin Brocovich'.",Null,7,22,22 December 2015
Coach Carter," Inspirational
","'Coach Carter' tells the story of a basketball coach who refuses to give up on a bunch of failing high school students in a deprived area of the city. The way Ken Carter insists and persists to help the students using his unconventional ways, being the call of his duty, is truly remarkable. There are so many thought provoking lines from Carter, such as saying 'That's exactly the problem' when responding to the principal's accusation of him taking the highlight of the students life away. How Carter motivated the students to be champions, not just in the basketball court, but in life as well, is truly inspiring and emotional. I really enjoyed this film.",Null,1,1,1 December 2013
Moon," Slow, dull and plain
","This film is about a lunar mining employee's last weeks on the moon, when he encounters many unexpected twists.Reading the plot synopsis of 'Moon' is enjoyable, as the story is filled with unexpected surprises. The minimalistic and futuristic sets look real, but plain and dull at the same time. Things happen slowly, and you can really feel the desolate solitude that Sam is in.However, the story is delivered slowly and is confusing. Most of the time it is a dull soliloquy, with occasional monotonous computer voices thrown in for a conversation. This means that the film is slow, dull and plain. There is not much to keep me interested at all.",Null,10,28,10 October 2009
Happy Feet," Poor story development and weak plot
","This film is about a penguin who cannot sing like the other penguins. He instead knows how to dance, and spreads the fun of dancing to the other penguins.I had high hopes when I watched this, as I have heard so many positive word of mouth. I was disappointed by this film. The plot is rather non existent. Am I really supposed to believe that the non dancing penguins suddenly know how to dance in choreographed ways in groups when they haven't even seen the entire dance? The plot was to make excuses for them to play songs, so that the studio can release a soundtrack. I felt I was watching an extended music video. The plot was so weak that the film could have been at least an hour shorter. Another problem was the lack of change of scenery. The entire story happened on ice, and watching penguin sing and dance for 2 hours became highly repetitive and boring.As of all recent animations, some moral enlightenment was thrown in to appeal to the adults. In this film, the moral was about 'fishing destroyed the natural habitat for penguins'. However, the message did not appear until the final 10 minutes of the film, meaning it was poorly developed. It felt more like an in your face propaganda that was not connected from the rest of the film.However, there were good things about this film, such as the excellent animation. Making hundreds of penguins dance must have been a painstaking task.I am disappointed by this film. It simply does not measure up to the other recent animations.",Null,0,1,22 January 2007
Her," Tedious and boring
","This film tells the story of a lonely writer with a failed marriage. He strikes up a romantic relationship with an intelligent computer operating system.Yes, the plot is a little bizarre. Even though films about virtual girls existed previously, I still find the plot of 'Her' a bit too weird. I could not get into the film at all. I can see why Theodore is so involved in the relationship, because this virtual relationship is so perfect and flawless. It lifts him from the trauma of his previous relationship, and ease the loneliness he feels. Still, the idea of a relationship with an operating system is still a bit too new for me. Though the initial few minutes were quite entertaining (especially the scene involving sexy kitten), I found 'Her' tedious and boring to watch.",Null,17,37,9 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," An amazing cinematic experience
","This film is about a lowly man from a slum, who performs unexpectedly well in a quiz show that will make him a millionaire.'Slumdog Millionaire' has to be the most captivating and breathtaking film for a while. The visuals are perfectly done, making the film stylised and uplifting; yet preserving the dismal nature of slums and the horrific experiences of Jamal. The flashbacks are the most gripping, it bares Jamal's tortuous past, exposing his emotional wounds that still has not heal. Since the characters is developed well, I care about Jamal and Latika deeply, and I greatly sympathise with their tragic past. Jamal knows a lot, only because he lived life like no one else, and he learnt everything the hard way.Along with the uplifting music, colourful visuals and the promise of hope, 'Slumdog Millionaire' is an amazing cinematic experience.",Null,0,2,27 December 2008
The Nice Guys," The adventures of two guys
","This film tells the story of a private detective and a street thug, who teams up to investigate the disappearance of a porn star. The deeper they dig, the dangerous it gets.'The Nice Guys' is a powerful draw as it has two strong and popular leaking men. The two guys have vet different personalities, and they team up reluctantly for money. Ryan Gosling's character provides much comic relief through many many mishaps. The plot is somewhat intriguing, but it doesn't engage me or thrill me. Maybe it is because I don't quite agree with the portrayal of the young daughter, who does a lot of age inappropriate things. Even though she is smart and brave, I wish she could just have a bit of childish innocence. Overall, It is an alright film, but I don't think there is nothing particularly memorable about it.",Null,0,1,10 August 2016

'Mad Max: Fury Road' has really good reviews, but it is completely not my cup of tea. Firstly, I wish they discovered other colours other than brown. Everything is brown, from the landscape, the vehicles, clothes and everything else. Secondly, the whole plot is quite ridiculous. If the blood bag is so important, who put him in front of the fighter vehicle, which is the most vulnerable place? In addition, there is a guy playing guitar in the battlefield, which is ridiculous. And spraying the mouth with silver paint is just weird. Actually, the whole film is so ridiculous beyond description. I didn't like it at all.",Null,22,47,15 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," It made me tremble and weep for an hour.
","This film tells the story of a man who is against killing people, even in the act of war. Yet his sense of patriotism and responsibility causes him to enlist. He insists on not touching any weapons, despite direct orders from seniors and even when he is face to face with enemies on the bloody battlefield.I have heard good things about 'Hacksaw Ridge', but nothing prepared me for such a powerful and touching experience. Initially, I find Andrew Garfield's innocent and even goofy smiles annoying. I kept wondering why cast someone in a heroic role when he does not look like the typical hero. His constant smiles made me wonder if he took anything seriously. Yet, over the course of the film, I have learned that he is just the most courageous and loving person anyone could hope to find on the battlefield. His selfless acts even in the most adverse conditions are beyond words. His heroic acts radiates throughout the second half of the film. Just like his fellow soldiers, I judged him too early.I checked the time twice in the cinema, not because of impatience, but because I wondered how much screen time there was left. The film was so powerful that tears kept falling for an hour. My body trembled uncontrollably, and I just didn't think I could take the heavy scenes anymore.I remember the first fifteen minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan'. The scene is now famous for being super gory and highly touching, that made it an effective anti-war message. In 'Hacksaw Ridge', the battle scene lasted for an hour, and every minute of it is as intense as the most famous war films. There have been so many minutes in the battle scenes that I just could not open my eyes. Just listening to the men screaming, shells exploding and guns firing was already enough to make my body and mind completely entrapped in the soldier's hell. Tears kept falling, and every part of me hoped for a relatively good outcome for the soldiers.'Hacksaw Ridge' is such an intense film. Every bit of it is superb. Even little things like the placement of bullet shells in the battlefield, and the final scene of Doss being lifted down tell stories that are not told in words. The very final scenes of the interviews with the survivors are very touching as well. To hear Doss recount his own experiences on the battlefield is certainly very effective and fascinating.This film is profoundly effective and emotional. Tears keep falling from my eyes. Even on the way home, as soon as I thought about the scene where all soldiers look to one side before going back up to the Ridge was enough to set my tears off again. Doss was such a valiant hero, he meant so much to the soldiers. Not only did Doss saved their lives, he saved the soldiers' morale as well.It is rare that I feel so much emotions during and after a film. It made me tremble and weep for an hour. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is truly superb.",Null,2,8,1 December 2016

They develop an unlikely bond, until things take a terrible turn.'Me Before You' is rather strange because the main character, Clarke, is rather strange. She has a very unusual fashion sense, yet she wants to study fashion. Fortunately, the guy, Will, is very amicable and likable. Their acquaintance and the subsequent bond is actually quite convincing and engaging. It has a touching plot, and it made my eyes well up. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,3,4,9 August 2016
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," An amazing, awesome blockbuster
","This film is about the secrets hidden in a severely damaged spacecraft on the dark side of the moon, and the subsequent chaos when Decepticons and Autobots fight for the Earth.'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' may be 2.5 hours long, but certainly feels a lot shorter. There is so much material to cover, that the story starts already at the first minute, wasting no time beating about the bush. The first two 'Transformers' had brainless plots, but this one has a great plot that engages and thrills throughout. Even though the ending is obligatorily predictable, I still find myself completely glued to the screen, waiting for events to unfold, and more importantly hoping things will turn out alright for the Earth. It's so engaging that I didn't even want to blink, for fear I might miss anything.The special effects are simply breathtaking and jaw dropping. The uninhibited rampage on the city is so awesome. And the 3D is very spectacular, it looks as if I was watching the events in the film live, as if I was there to experience it. Even a trail of dust look so 3D. A friend of mine once said 'Why watch a film in 3D when you can watch everything else in 3D. Well, 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' shows that watching a 3D film offers more than what the eyes normally see in real life.",Null,4,12,29 June 2011
The Social Network," Intelligent and fun
","This film is about the founding of the wildly Facebook, and the subsequent lawsuits that followed.'The Social Network' has a good script and unconventional story telling. The non linear story telling by intersecting scenes reminds me of 'Memento', but in 'The Social Network' it is more accessible. The script is full of witty dialogs, I really enjoyed all the amazing retorts in the legal meetings. The film comes across as a fun, intelligent film which young people can easily relate to. It's quite amazing that a film about computers can be totally not nerdy at all! Facebook is the website at the moment, so a film about Facebook will automatically become the film everyone's talking about. I thought 'The Social Network' would be over-hyped because of this, but it turns out that the hype is justified.",Null,0,1,11 November 2010

","This film tells the story of a noble Thane in Scotland, who is told by three witches that he will become the king of Scotland. He embarks on a journey to make the prophecy come true, shedding tears and blood along the way.I have to say this is a very good adaptation of Macbeth. The lines are original Shakespearean lines, delivered with conviction by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, who are both interestingly not Scottish or even British. The film emanates intensity throughout, because of the intended battle scene at the beginning, followed by the gripping delivery of the plot. The final scene is in an environment of reddish dust, making it so intense and stylish. I enjoyed watching it.",Null,0,0,3 May 2016
The Pursuit of Happyness," Realistic portrayal of urban life
","This film is about a man's struggle to find happiness by chasing his dream to become a stockbroker.Throughout most of the film, we get to see Will Smith being very poor and have very bad luck. It is a realistic portrayal of how urban life can be for many of the lower socio-economic class. I am sure Will Smith's character gets a lot of resonance in the viewer's hearts. The interaction between Will Smith and his wife and son is also good. His wife (Newton) is disapproving and distant, while his son is warm and adorable. Their interaction is cruelly realistic.The plot is good because it is not as predictable as the average comedy. We don't get the happy then sad then happy pattern, instead we get a sad sad sad then happy pattern. It is good the Hollywood tries something new! Will Smith's acting is excellent. The final scene where he is very happy when he hears some good news, we do not get a hysterical happiness. Instead, it is subtle and from the heart. It is a very impressive portrayal of happiness.This film is definitely worth the watch!",Null,1,2,30 December 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," Intense and engaging
","This film is about an amnesic ex secret agent, who gets framed for murdering two secret agents. He goes on the run from country to country.'Bourne Supremacy' is very intense! The great thing about the plot is that it is believable. Jason Bourne looks just as human as any other people on the street, and yet he is so well trained to survive even the most severe hardship. Another thing is that 'Bourne Supremacy' does not require sex to sell, because the filmmakers know that the film is solid enough to attract great crowds.The numerous twists are unexpected and engaging. The high speed car chase in Moscow is breathtaking and thrilling, and I could not get my eyes off the screen! The suspense is maintained throughout. It is hard for an action film to be so engaging, but 'Bourne Supremacy' excels in this aspect.Sequels are usually lousy and ridiculous, but in this case it only gets better than the original 'Bourne Identity'. No wonder 'Bourne Supremacy' has had very good word of mouth.",Null,2,4,10 December 2007
The Great Gatsby," Intriguing and engaging
","This film is about a Wall Street employee who recalls his days when he lived next to a very rich gentleman in New York.I have not read the literary classic before, so I have no preconceived ideas about the story of 'The Great Gatsby'. I find this film tells the story of Mr Gatsby in an expert manner, in which it intrigues and engages the viewers throughout the film. Mr Gatsby is portrayed to be a man with manners and charm, but almost no one knows about him. This adds to the mystique of this character, driving viewers to want more.The opulent settings and the extravagant parties are very astounding. Leonardo DiCaprio is so convincing as a well bred gentleman, while Carey Mulligan shows her delicate side as she is torn between to men. I enjoyed watching 'The Great Gatsby'.",Null,2,4,7 September 2013
The Proposal," It fills you with happiness, warmth and love
","This film is about a demanding and unreasonable boss who forces her subordinate to marry her, in order for her to stay in the USA.'The Proposal' is excellent! The first scene looks so much like 'The Devil Wears Prada', and I thought the film would not be good. Fortunately, the film gets better and better, until it just can't get any better! Sandra Bullock is great as a cold and demanding boss, and her subsequent emotions are so touching and heartfelt. I never thought of her as an amazing actress, but she impressed me in this film. Everything about the plot is right, it does not follow the typical romantic comedy plot line. It is packed with funny jokes. The viewers laughed so hard with the characters, and not at the characters. It has such a great uplifting and fun tone. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have great chemistry.

The slightly non-chronological order does not affect the story, as most people would have already heard what happened on the news. I find the story very engaging, and I really feel for Captain Sully. He acts honourably and makes critical decisions decisively, saving all people on board the aircraft. Yet, the subsequent investigation is so unfair, without any consideration of his past accomplishments and without respect. The undue pressure from the unnecessary fault finding exercise simply puts professionals off their work. I can relate to his predicament, that he has to fight for justice and his honour just because something goes wrong beyond his control. If professionals are discouraged from working and serving the society, our societies will simply not function.'Sully' brought tears to my eyes. Clint Eastwood makes yet another film that moves me to tears.",Null,0,2,22 September 2016

There are so many really funny jokes in the film that I laughed out so loud. The jokes are definitely better than the toilet humour as in the South Park movie. The plot is entertaining and wildly funny. I hope the American president doesn't choose policies like in the movie!

The initial scene of Michael Fassbender in a facility and the subsequent scenes on the spacecraft don't blend very well.

He does everything he can to survive, while the Earth sets up an unprecedented rescue mission to bring him back home safely.Many people say 'The Martian' is a very good film, and I do agree after watching it. The plot is simple but it has all the right elements to capture the viewers' hearts. To see Mark survive against all odds is very engaging and touching. In addition, the Herculean efforts to rescue him back to Earth is even more touching because there are almost insurmountable technical difficulties. The risk of failure is so high, that death seems almost certain. That of course brings about an poignant ending, which surely leaves me in tears. I enjoyed watching 'The Martian'.",Null,3,5,10 January 2016

","This film is about a boxer who rises to stardom with the help of his half-brother, who is an ex-boxer that messes his career up by indulging in illicit drugs.I was expecting something as emotionally gripping and touching as 'The Wrestler', but 'The Fighter' is nowhere near as good. 'The Fighter' is so dialog heavy, and most of the time the dialog is just arguments or some unimportant nonsense. This constant babbling already put me off early into the film. The story itself is not engaging, the emotional highs and lows are not so pronounced. It just does not grip me and does not offer me an emotional ride. As a boxing film, 'The Fighter' may work, but not as an Oscar worthy tearjerker.",Null,24,41,10 January 2011
High Fidelity," Not so enjoyable
","This film is about a record store owner going through a breakup by recounting his previous 'Top 5 break ups'.I see that a lot of people like this film, but 'High Fidelity' is not for me. I don't know the songs and can't get into the mood. The constant 'top 5' lists are annoying and rather pointless. Jack Black's character, Barry, is very annoying. I dislike Bary so much that I could not stand him. But then, the ability of Barry evoking so much emotion in me is a sign of it being successfully portrayed. As for the other record store employee, I find Dick rather likable. Todd Louiso is actually a good actor, he is able to portray shyness and restrained gestures very well. I am surprised that he is not in more movies.Overall, I found 'High Fidelity' rather flat and boring.",Null,1,2,15 September 2008

His world becomes upside down when his job is radically changed by a newly recruited young fresh graduate.'Up in the Air' is a well made film. The plot focuses on character development and emotional changes of the characters. It is not easy to make characters interesting and memorable, but 'Up in the Air' does just that. Both the characters of George Clooney and Anna Kendrick have strongly divergent attitudes and personalities, but they have great chemistry and change each other slowly but surely. How they radically shake each others core belief is engagingly told. I enjoyed watching 'Up in the Air' a lot, as it tells an engaging story of self discovery.",Null,40,65,16 January 2010

A masked man with special skills is determined to bring people together to overthrow the government.'V for Vendetta' exceeds my expectations! It is not just a cool comic book adaptation, but a film that draws parallels to real life political situations in some parts of the world. V has almost superpowers, yet he keeps a low profile in his cave, and is polite and modest. It is remarkable how he can bring people together and change something that seems unchangeable.

The Island," Excellent film with all the elements of a blockbuster
","This film is about two people in a futuristic utopian facility finding out the truth behind their seemingly fulfilling life.From the beginning to the end, this film has so much to offer. There is plenty of eye candies such as the stylish sets, tight and sexy costumes, good looking leads, and lots of action. I think Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson work together very well, and they are convincing as best friends and lovers. The action scenes are breathtaking, the car chases and the downtown chases are so exciting and gripping. I don't know why it was a flop in the cinemas in America. This film is simply got all the elements of a blockbuster.Apart from this, it also explores the moral and ethical issues concerned with the science of human cloning. Is it right to clone? Do clones have the right to live? Though this film is not to provide answers, it certainly is thought provoking and will stimulate discussion for years to come.",Null,0,0,3 August 2007
Furious 7," The double alpha of action films
","This film tells the story of a team of daredevil drivers who ate recruited by the secret service to rescue a kidnapped hacker who has invented a powerful surveillance software.With the series being the who's who of conventional action superstars, 'Fast And Furious 7' finally corrected the conspicuous absence of Jason Statham. He certainly doesn't disappoint, as every star deliver awesome action scenes. This film is different from the others because it's really good. It's not ridiculous and brainless like 'The Expendables' series; and it's not attention deficit like the Bourne series. This combines action, brains and emotions, which is a perfect blend for blockbuster success. The action scenes are simply awesome. The scene of a car flying between buildings is superb, but by no means the best. There are so many other astounding scenes that got me holding my breath, literally. For example, Paul Walker trying to escape from a bus is a scene that made me stop breathing because it's so intense. The film is so packed with action, but it doesn't feel fragmented or attention deficit. That is what makes it stand above other action films.'Fast And Furious 7' constantly surprises me with jaw dropping action. Just when I thought I have seen everything, and nothing can surprise me anymore, the surprises keep on coming. I'm truly amazed by the film. I guess no one thought James Wan could make such an awe inspiring film, after establishing himself as a great horror director.",Null,87,117,5 April 2015
