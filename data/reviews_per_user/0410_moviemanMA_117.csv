Moneyball," Baseball by the numbers
","Moneyball tells the story of the 2002 season of the Oakland Athletics, a team that rose to notoriety because of its low payroll and unorthodox player selection. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former player turned general manage, grows tired with the ancient, inefficient ways of the game he has committed his entire life to. When a transaction goes awry he stumbles across Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a Yale, economics graduate who believes he has a system to rating players based on numbers.Billy and Peter begin trading, signing, and grooming the team based on data, not scouting, something that other members of the team are not fond of, including Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the team's manager. Billy and Peter's system defies current baseball logic, but when the club starts to win games with players like Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt), David Justice (Stephen Bishop), and Chad Bradford (Casey Bond), the eyes of the country turn to Oakland, where only seeing is believing.What happened in Oakland back in '02 was incredible. It shouldn't have happened if you ask the right people, and other people will tell you it means nothing. Well, it did mean something it has changed the way people think about the game for good. You couldn't just go out and look at a kid to see if he would be a star or not. There were more stats to consider than home runs, strikeouts, and batting average. The game was expanding and becoming more and more a battle of logic.The film's structure is centered mostly on Billy Beane, but the most exciting parts for me were about the system. Writer Aaron Sorkin, who a few months back accepted a slew of awards for his screenplay The Social Network, tosses out jargon that baseball fanatics go crazy for. For the general audience, that's where Billy helps out. Peter explains the system and has to break it down more for Beane (i.e. the audience) so everybody on screen and in the seats is on the same page.Pitt's portrayal of Beane won me over. He completely caught me off guard. I know Pitt can act but I remember him for performances that were very complex on the outside. Aldo Raine (Inglourious Basterds) with his pronounces chin, squinty eyes, and thick accent. Benjamin Button (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) who grew younger as he got older. Jeffrey Goines (12 Monkeys) who couldn't sit still let alone focus on one subject in a conversation. Yes, he was nominated for all these performances, but in a performance like this there is something bubbling under the surface. All of his characters to an extent have something going on underneath, only this character, Billy Beane, is so normal and calm on the outside, yet when he is alone we can see pain and frustration.His supporting cast of Hill, Hoffman, and the slew of ball players and colleagues, help turn this baseball team into the world of Oakland Athletics. Hill and Hoffman especially play perfect compliments to Pitt's sunny exterior. Hill is quiet, timid, and very smart. Hoffman is cold, weathered, and stubborn. Pitt is able to play off of both temperaments and make their scenes together pop off the screen.The one thing that this movie has going for it is the lack of actual action on the diamond. There are some great scenes of actual baseball, one at bat by Hatteberg in particular struck a chord with me, but for the most part the action is behind the scenes. There is enough for a sports junkie to get their fix and enough drama and with Beane and his family to entice any average viewer into the theater. I can't think of many target groups that wouldn't find it interesting, except for children, due to language and complexity of some of the dialogue. All in all this is one movie that will please a lot of people, and more importantly a lot of different people, sort of like The Blind Side, only the movie is actually really good.",9,167,195,24 September 2011
Angels & Demons," A little less controversy still makes a fun movie
","Ron Howard made a splash three years ago with his adaptation of Dan Brown's best seller The Da Vinci Code. The Catholic Church and countless religious groups protested the films release, only to make it one of the highest grossing films of 2006. It only made sense that Howard would take the helm of Brown's other book, Angels & Demons.Now, I have not read either of Brown's books so I cannot give a comparison to the films. I did however really enjoy The Da Vinci Code and looked forward to Angels & Demons with great anticipation.After watching it, I felt close to the same as I did with Da Vinci: satisfied. I won't say that this film is better or worse than the previous one because it isn't really. I'd say it's right on par and there is no reason why people shouldn't see it.The story follows Professor Robert Langdon, played by Tom Hanks who reprises his role from the previous film. He is called upon by the Vatican police to help them locate four missing cardinals. Simultaneously, a group of scientists create, without going into details, something that can blowup, only to have some of it stolen. The two stories are linked and Langdon must sort it all out. What makes matters worse is the Pope has just passes and a new one must be chosen, ideally one of the four kidnapped cardinals.The group who is responsible is an underground cult called the Illuminati, people who were hunted down by the Church for their beliefs in science. They say they will kill the cardinals and that the device they stole will detonate by midnight, wiping out Vatican City and part of Rome. Langdon and Vittoria Vetra (Ayele Zurer), one of the lead scientists involved with the explosives, race around Vatican City and Rome to find the cardinals and the device before time runs out. Howard takes us on a labyrinthian ride through archives, catacombs, and churches to try and stop the Illuminati from destroying Vatican City.Puzzles, symbols, and history take up most of this film, culminating in a thrilling journey that will have you guessing until the very end. Hanks will keep you engaged with the story and his supporting cast is not so bad either with Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skargard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl.Unlike Da Vinci, this isn't nearly as controversial and is more a work of fiction. There is a message being sent that science and religion should work hand in hand and whether or not faith is something you earn or learn, but it really downplays the story and that is the best part. There is a pointless monologue that McGregor's character gives to the conclave in the Sistine Chapel. What he should be saying at that time isn't said and he goes on about religion and science, at a time when he should be worrying about the bomb that is about to go off and so forth.There were times when I thought certain characters knew more about something than they should have (like Vittoria). I also would have liked a little more background on Langdon. They touched upon it but I think more would have been nice. Some parts of the story that were a bit too ridiculous as well (a portion of the ending made me think 'Are you kidding me?'). All that said, I thought the story with all of its twists and turns was enjoyable. It isn't perfect, but it kept my attention, which is exactly what Howard was intending to do.",7,2,3,23 May 2009
Black Swan," The price of perfection
","Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan is an examination of obsession. Obsession for beauty, fame, and above all, perfection. We are shown glimpses of its splendor, only to be consumed by the ugliness and harsh reality that is the world of professional ballet.Nina Sayers, played by the talented Natalie Portman, is placed in the precarious situation of replacing the company's former star (Winona Ryder), the shining pupil of director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), in the production of Swan Lake. The role is a dual role, in which she must play both the sweet, innocent White Swan as well as her evil twin sister, the Black Swan. Though Nina is best suited for the White Swan, she must find a way to evoke her inner Black Swan.Though all of the ballerinas in the company would kill for her role, the least jealous one, Lily, played by Mila Kunis in a breakthrough performance, has become Nina's biggest rival, catching the eye of Thomas. Still, Nina is set on perfecting the role.It is Nina's obsession for perfection, a constant theme through the film, that is the root of her troubles. This obsession is passed down from her mother, played brilliantly by Barbara Hershey. She too was a ballerina but gave up her career to support Nina, living vicariously through her daughter. Her obsession for dance is shared by all dancers, really, but Nina takes it a step further, causing it to physically and mentally affect her.The pain and suffering that Nina's goes through takes its toll early on in the film. She sees herself on the faces of strangers, the scratching and itching she inflicts on her back, yet we never see, and the scrapes and cuts that appear out of thin air, as if something inside of her is ready to burst out. As the film goes on, it becomes more clear that her thoughts and hallucinations are blending with her reality to the point where she can't distinguish the two from one another.Here's where Aronofsky's obsession/passion for filmmaking takes over. He too seeks perfection in his work, finding the right camera angles, the right tempo, and the right composition. This film has some of his best camera work to date, thanks to the cinematography of Matthew Libatique, whose fluid camera movements are the glue that hold the film together.Aronofsky is a director who tries to make his shots look as beautiful as they can be, while not blowing you away with CGI and special effects. The Fountain, though not a perfect movie by any means, had some truly outstanding photography (also partnered with Libatique) that wasn't heavy on the artificial special effects. Here he makes a similar attempt to create an incredibly realistic picture. It helps that both Portman and Kunis dedicated months and months of training and dieting to get the appropriate look for the film. That hard work paid off for sure.Without those two ladies the film would be lost. Having seen the film I can't see another actress in either role. They were perfectly cast. Portman, though not afraid to show some skin for the camera in a film like Closer (and even Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones), acts and appears so fragile and innocent in many of her roles. Kunis on the other hand, hearkening back to her days on 'That 70s Show' has always been the pretty girl with a bit of attitude. Her eyes are almost hypnotic. These two women play perfectly off of each other, contrasting like the two swans in the ballet. I'm sure the talk of the movie will be the scene in Nina's bedroom (see it for yourself), but I enjoyed their night on the town leading up to the bedroom scene more. We see Lilly's influence and persuasiveness affect Nina tremendously.Their performances are backed by a tight story. It's takes us places that we least expect to go, showing us beautiful and disturbing images that you would not expect from a movie about ballerinas, making Black Swan one of the more original psychological thrillers in the past decade. Like every good thriller, there needs to be good music, too. Enter Clint Mansell, whose score for Aronofsky's second film Requiem for a Dream has become one of the more beloved scores of all time. I am particularly fond of his work for Moon, but Requiem is just as good if not better. Here we have a great blend of classical and original pieces.These pieces come together to create a portrait of a dancer whose demeanor gets in the way of her heart's yearning for success. When her dreams start slipping, her mind does the same. Passion leads to obsession. Obsession leads to transformation. The White Swan becomes the Black Swan, and she must pay the price.",9,302,446,5 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Seriously, enough is enough.
","The one word I kept repeating as I watched Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was, 'Why?' Why haven't they explained the disappearance of the characters from the previous films? Why are mermaids a complete ripoff of sirens? Why was this movie made???All questions aside, let's go through the brief synopsis. The film opens with the Spanish discovering a book that leads to the fountain of youth. Jump to London, we find Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) in a tight bind (per usual). In an attempt to acquire a new ship, he runs into an old flame, Angelica (Penélope Cruz). Without giving away too much, Sparrow and Angelica wind up on Captain Blackbeard's boat (Ian McShane), who is also in search of the fountain.Meanwhile, Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush), under orders of the King of England, is on a mission to beat the Spanish to the fountain. Though his pirate roots run deep, he uses the English for his own personal gain, the reason for which is revealed later.To be honest, there isn't much to the story without revealing some marginally important plot points like relationships being revealed and character histories. Here's what you need to know, there are three main parties rushing towards the fountain of youth. They all cross each other's paths from time to time, and they each have their own motives for reaching the fountain. To use the fountain's powers they must perform a ritual that requires two silver cups from Ponce de Leon, a tear from a mermaid, and a human sacrifice.Let's start with what works, as that list is the shortest. The special effects are decent. Nothing new from the previous films, just decent. Depp hasn't lost a step with Captain Jack, though he hasn't learned any new tricks. Not a good thing, not a bad thing. The same goes for Rush. To be honest, that's all I have to say as far as compliments go, and those weren't really compliments. More like aspects of the film that I didn't strongly dislike.I'll begin with the action. Over the top is one way to describe it. Boring is another. I think it's best to call it pointless. There are chases and sword fights that seem to go on and on when there was really no need for it. There is a part where two opposing characters are about to face off, swords in hand, fire in their eyes. Just before they face off with their bands of troops behind them, Jack Sparrow steps in, noting that it is only the two men who have the conflict. A valid argument, but the men fight anyways. The fight is eerily similar to the one that took place at the end of the first Pirates movie. How interesting.The story? Flawed. It comes off as if it were written to be made into a video game. There are small quests, puzzles, and sword fights galore. Every bit of which is predictable as the one before it. Accompanying this story is a cast of new characters, also predictable and uninteresting. For the fourth straight movie we meet a new pirate captain, one that is supposedly unbeatable, infamous for past battles. The writers are running out of pirate lore to exploit. Who is next? Captain Hook? Sandwich? Morgan?This is by far the most violent Disney film ever. I'm not just talking about a few bad guys meeting their untimely end via a distant explosion. For those interested in preserving the shock, skip this paragraph. A MAN IS STRIPPED OF HIS FLESH! Yeah. Don't be fooled by the Disney logo at the beginning. There is some pretty wild stuff here. It's one thing to show living (sort of dead) pirates. It's a horse of a different color when a live pirate gets the arch of the covenant treatment. There are several others attacked by sea creatures while others just get capped. On the whole a lot of death.So who is behind this? The blame could lie on Rob Marshall, whose previous work is primarily show-stopping musical pieces like Chicago and Nine. As easy as it is to blame him I don't think he has much to do with it. It has an almost identical look to the other films, which begs the question who has the bigger influence, Rob Marshall (Gore Verbinski for the previous three films) or producer Jerry Bruckheimer? I'm better on Bruck. This is his baby and I'm sure he has the final say.Back to my original question of 'why?' In short, the answer is money. The previous two sequels made a large, and I mean large, sum of cash. Although I highly doubt this one will be as successful, I'm sure they will get their money's worth and then some. Money aside I honestly can't see why this film was made. It completely abandons several key characters from the previous films and in the end, I'm sorry to say, takes us nowhere. It is a zero gain. At least in the other films there was some sort of terror or element that could potentially lead to the end of the world. Not here. Sorry. Nada.Save you money for something worth while. And do not, DO NOT, see this in 3D. I saw this in standard definition and it was fine. With the money you spend on 3D you can have a couple of months worth of Netflix movies. That is a much better deal.",3,3,5,31 May 2011
The New World," A Different Look
","It is hard to go anywhere in this country without seeing the effects of western civilization on the landscape of the world. Cities are reaching higher and higher into the sky. Areas once populated with trees and streams are now occupied by housing complexes and mini-malls. The land once known as the 'new world' is fading.Terrence Malick's (The Thin Red Line, Badlands) The New World focuses on the first encounter between the white man and the Native Americans. Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer, The Insider) leads a group of men with the help of the sometimes troublesome Captain John Smith (Clin Farrell, Phone Booth) and a host of other Englishmen as they try and establish a colony in this 'new world'.The natives, upon seeing these massive ships pouring out strange men in funny costumes, are started and intrigued. Chief Powhatan has many wives and many daughters. Pocahontas is, by far, his favorite daughter. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher is dazzling as the energetic, free spirited native.After setting up a fort like encampment, Smith and others go out in search of the native's camp. Smith finds himself surrounded by a large group of natives and they overpower him. He is taken back to their Chief who has the final say in what will be done to Smith. In a very ceremonious motion, Pocahontas persuades her father to spare his life and let her find out the ways of his people.For a long time, Smith and Pocahontas teach each other who their people really are by learning the others language. The first session between the two is one of the many intimate and tasteful scenes in the movie.The movie itself is a historical retelling of the events that occurred in Jamestown in the 17the century. The movie is practically void of dialogue and tends to focus more on the emotions of its characters. Malick does, however, incorporate character narration, which gives us an interesting look into what they are feeling. The movie is, in some ways, a collection of journal entries by Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe (Christian Bale, Batman Begins) come-to-life.Kilcher was about 14 years old when the movie was made. Some of the intimate scenes are very passionate, but tame for today's moviegoers. She shows a lot of potential for the future. Along with Kilcher is a very different Farrell. He gives his best performance since Tigerland (2000).Malick's work with the camera is impressive. Nature seems to co-exists with the characters and interacts with them. It is incredibly surreal at times. James Horner's (A Beautiful Mind, Titanic) beautiful score enhances this effect.Nominated for an Academy Award in Best Cinematography, The New World is not your typical film. The battle scenes are tastefully done as so every member of the audience can refrain from covering their eyes. Overall, the movie is well made, well-acted, and is an interesting look at an important historical event.",8,3,7,9 February 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Next Generation
","Comedy is an ever-changing genre in film. From the early silent, slapstick pictures of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand to the zany and sometimes 'clueless' comedies of the 80's and 90's, comedy refuses to remain stagnant.Each new generation of comedy has its breakthrough film. Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1931) introduced the romantic comedy; Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) showed the world how to laugh at war and gave birth to the political satire; and Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977) gave birth to a more artsy comedy, with originality and emphasis on the dialogue between characters. Now Sacha Baron Cohen has delivered the best thing to hit comedy since the banana cream pie: shocking cultural satire.I sat in the theatre expecting a movie with little rhyme or reason for being made other than simple entertainment and the opportunity to take a few cheap pokes at religion, America, and a host of unsuspecting victims. When the opening credits rolled, I knew I was in store for something completely different. I got what I expected, just not in the manner I expected to.Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Better Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is genius. One of Cohen's hit HBO series Da Ali G Show's characters is Borat Sagdiev, a Kazakhstani reporter who is sent to America to film a documentary about American culture and why it 'is greatest country in the world'. The mysteries of proper etiquette, rodeos, automobiles, and woman's rights are all revealed to Borat. Starting in Borat's hometown (more like village), he gives the audience an inside look on the inner workings of his town. After showing off his VCR and sister (the number four prostitute in the country), he gets ready to take on western civilization, or at least all that his country missed. His journey will be time consuming, tiresome, and under budget.The plot is simple. Borat travels across America in search of 'cultural learnings' and his dream girl, C.J. Parker of Baywatch (a.k.a. Pamela Anderson). Along the way he encounters counselors, Evangelists, and a host of unsuspecting bystanders. It is rare to find such an entertaining film with such a thin plot line.Without Cohen, Borat would be another forgettable film. His dedication and fearless approach to the character, however, makes the film work. He is successful in getting the laughs no matter what the cost. No subject seems to be off limit. A man of the Jewish faith, himself, Cohen's Borat verbally attacks the Jewish community, which exposes one society's biggest enemies: ignorance. This gives the comedy edge and a real satirical bite. This film will undoubtedly offend those who believe that comedy has strict boundaries. For Middle America and those who appreciate crude, abusive, and hard comedy, however, Borat will satisfy. Some scenes in the film are almost embarrassing to watch and might be too 'intense' for some moviegoers. A second look, however, will probably force a chuckle if not a belly full of laughter.Borat has a hard R rating for language, nudity, adult themes, and crude, sexual content. It has a lot of everything for a lot of people. Candid camera moments as well as some classic comedy motifs unfold into a sidesplitting joy ride. Borat will have 'Great success!'",10,3,9,15 November 2006
The Young Victoria," A nice story with lots of evening wear
","The Young Victoria luckily has a story, and even better than that, it has good actors. That's where a film like The Other Boleyn Girl fails. The acting just didn't match the characters. Emily Blunt, who has quickly risen up the ranks into Hollywood A-list status, gives one of her better performances, worthy of her Golden Globe nomination, as the famed English monarch Queen Victoria.The film follows Victoria in the year leading up to her coronation and into the first few years of her reign, including her relationship of Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). Victoria was a very protected and sheltered princess who was under constant surveillance by her mother and close friend and adviser. Victoria was next in line to take the crown once the King had passed, on so naturally a lot of attention as to when she would ascend to the thrown and how was being discussed. One thing is clear; Victoria does not want to be treated like a child.Her budding romance with Prince Albert starts before she is made Queen. The Prince is selected to try and win her affection as a political ally, but one thing leads to another and the two become smitten with each other. Albert is aware that the two of them are very young and must look out for one another, especially in the realm of politics. So called 'friends' can become powerful influences on the crown, especially in the case of Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), who imposes his political party's agenda upon the queen in a back door sort of way, surrounding her with his own people.Victoria learns quickly, and so do we, that the game of politics is a dicey one. It's hard to see which side people are really on, and by the time you do it might be too late.I was pleased with the pace and direction of this movie. It could have been too much about the fashion or too much about the politics, but it balanced the two out pretty well. Blunt and Friend are fine opposite each other, playfully going back and forth with their Victorian era flirtations. There is a definite bond their that shows up well on screen.The rest of the cast does an excellent job. Bettany, Miranda Richardson as Victoria's mother the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy, the Duchess' adviser, and a nice cameo by Jim Broadbent as an ailing King William. Bettany in particular plays his role quite well, never really telling us whether he is helping the Queen out or trying to do good for himself alone.The costumes are quite authentic and well made. They don't always distract the viewer's eye but at times they are a bit showy. I guess those were the times. The sets are incredibly detailed. I particularly liked the attention paid to the little knick-knacks and pieces of furniture in the bedrooms and studies. It felt like people were living there.It wasn't a perfect film and it did have it's dull moments. I thought it ended nicely and didn't wander off to take us places where we didn't need to go.",7,2,2,25 April 2010
The Hangover," Blame it on the alcohol
","Todd Phillips, the writer/director of Road Trip, Old School, and Starsky & Hutch, brings us another rowdy trip through manhood with The Hangover. We follow Doug (Justin Bartha), his best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms), as well as Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Doug's future brother in-law, who plan on making Doug's bachelor party one to remember. It's certainly memorable, but not the night itself.The morning after Phil, Stu, and Alan find themselves back in their hotel suite with very little clothing, a chicken, a baby, a missing tooth, and no Doug. Oh, and their is a tiger in the bathroom. The three set out in search for the missing groom who has a day to be back in L.A. in less than two days for his wedding. They take the baby, shake off their hangovers, and hit the strip looking for clues that lead them to the hospital, a wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson's house.The story is as ridiculous as it sounds, but I was still completely engrossed in what was going on. I couldn't believe how messed up their night was, yet I was completely focused on what would happen next. It's the kind of film where from the start you just accept that crazy things are going to happen and you just enjoy the ride.The three leads, Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis could not have been better choices. Cooper has the looks and charisma to handle his 'too cool' character. Helms, more commonly known as Andy Bernard on NBC's 'The Office', is perfect as the nice guy with a mean streak (and missing tooth). Galifianakis could not have made me laugh any more than I did. His looks alone let you know you can't take him seriously. He is pudgy, childish, and completely engrossed in his character. Unlike some filmmakers who make similar films, Phillips has not fallen off his game. He didn't get lazy and go through the motions. Each scene, each line, and each set up follow through in their delivery and add to the flow of the film. There were times when the action might get a little too serious, but he brings us back from reality and throws a one liner or situation you can't help but laugh at. It's so enjoyable.I really didn't know what to expect coming into this film and I sure am pleased with the results. I didn't anticipate liking The Hangover as much as I did and it is probably going to be one of the best films I will see this summer. If you are of age and are in need of a good laugh, go see this. I take that back. If you are of age go see it anyways. It's worth the price of admission and then some.",8,1,2,10 June 2009
United 93," The Inevitable
","The events that took place on September 11th are still embedded into the minds of Americans everywhere. For months there was no escape from those dreaded images and the idea that terrorists are stronger than previously thought. The last thing to worry about would be a a picture about the events on that fateful day. Upon hearing that there would be not one but two movies released less than five years after the catastrophe (Oliver Stone's World Trade Center being the second), I was skeptical to say the least. Is our country ready to relive those terrible hours on the big screen?United 93 takes a look at the last hours of the passengers aboard United Airlines Flight 93. The films opens with the terrorists making some final preparations before they leave. Director Paul Greengrass jumps around throughout the film from control room to control room and back to the situation aboard the plane. Because of all people involved, there is no need to delve into backgrounds for the characters, just the fact that they are present is all that is necessary for the film to work.The movie isn't completely centered around the flight of United 93, but the events leading up to the fateful crash in Pennsylvania. One idea that is constant throughout the film is that question of 'what now?' Today's world has changed because of what happened in New York City, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania. We are much more cautious and anxious about taking the next step. In 2001 no one could have foreseen this happening to America. A country that for hundreds of years has taken in all sorts of cultures and given them fresh start on life. It is almost a stab in the back. To see the panic in the faces of the air traffic controllers and the stewardesses is a chilling reminder of how we all felt that day.Greengrass luckily didn't go out of his way into making this a blockbuster smash like The Perfect Storm. Both are stories that have holes missing in the actual time line of events. The only certain aspect of these movies is the outcome. Rather than relying on the big name actors to lead the passengers in an uprising against the terrorists, Greengrass acquires talent in numbers, forging an element of realism in the passengers. The casting of actual military personnel is a much needed touch that makes the movie that more believable. Without this aspect of the film it would be making a mockery of the event and smearing the movie industry.The message being sent isn't to be more patriotic or more anti-Islam. The message emanating from the film to be informed and to understand what ordinary people can accomplish in an extraordinary situation. Of course these people should be honored and remembered, but the movie doesn't make them into Harrison Ford's and Sigourney Weaver's. It creates their legend. They saved hundreds possibly thousands of lives, taking their own.Skeptical as I was, I only knew of one thing coming into the movie and that was the outcome. I knew that there was no way this movie could end happily. Michael Bay tried to do this with the movie Pearl Harbor and made a shamble of such a solemn and tragic event. Although the ending was certain, the beginning and body of the movie was basically a mystery entering the theatre. It truly was an informative and necessary piece.So where is our country now? Have we come any farther from when we once were? United 93 doesn't answer that question. The answer lies within every American. Do we move on and remember the thousands of lives lost that day, or do we stay in the past beneath the pain and agony that came screaming out of the sky?",10,2,5,9 May 2006
Casablanca," Blueprint for Imortality
","The one you love is already taken. The people who need help can't get it. The country you love is thousands of miles away. The only person you can trust is yourself. The only way out is through bribes and lies. This just a typical scenario for Casablanca.In Nazi oppressed Casablanca, everyday could be your last. Your life isn't safe as long as you have enough money. For Rick Blaine, Casablanca is as far away from home and his past that he can get. Troubled by a lost love, Rick has become the owner of a night club. With the help of his friend Captain Renault, his business of drinking, entertainment, and illegal gambling make Rick's the place to be. His life long friend and piano player Sam is with him until the end. What seems like a decent existence in the desert is about to be thrown into a whirlwind of trouble.One evening at Rick's, a distinguished guest arrives. It is the leader of the underground Resistance, Victor Laszlo. He and his companion arrive shortly after one of Laszlo's comrades, Ugarte, is captured and killed. Rick has no intention of helping Laszlo and his underground movement until he meets his wife Ilsa. When their eyes meet, it is as if a freight train has ran right through Rick. The one thing he has been hiding from has found him. The woman that left him alone on that platform in Paris after the Nazi invasion is back.His only solution is to start drinking, but drowning his sorrows solves nothing. After the first night, Rick must make a decision. Does he give up Laszlo to the authorities or aid him in escaping the Nazis? Rather than halting all illegal activities that make Rick's the place to be, it is business as usual. Giving Laszlo the information he needs would help win the war. It would also mean giving up the only woman he would die for. Now the weight of the war rests on Rick's shoulders, as well as his heart.This is not just a love story, Casablanca has everything. It has action, comedy, thrills, as well as romance. The background is the second world war, but the story could have taken place earlier, later, or even today. The Epstein brother's winning screenplay cannot be compared to anything of its generation or future generations for that matter. The flow of conversation goes back and forth like it would in real life Casablanca. Witty remarks, memorable lines, and dialogue that would be considered 'cliche' today are 'cliche' because films of this archetype copy Casablanca in so many ways.Where would Casablanca be without its cast? The film, although virtually flawless, is illuminated by its fantastic actors. Humphrey Bogart, with his charisma and overwhelmingly powerful screen presence, stars as Rick, the lost soul. His lover Ilsa, portrayed lovely by Ingrid Bergman, doesn't know what is right anymore. Claude Rains as Captain Renault tries to make a living off of the illegal activities at Rick's. Ilsa's husband Lazslo, Paul Henried, is ever defiant of the Nazi oppression, after surviving one of their concentration camps. His cause is stronger than ever. Thorwn together, this ensemble, accompanied by some nice appearances by Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Conrad Veidt, cultivate a story that is fueled by desires and overflowing with energy.Casablanca has been captivating audiences around the world for decades. It can only be assumed that director Michael Curtiz and his team of writers figured out how to make a film. All the pieces fit to get this picture churning. From the opening frame to those last lines by Bogart ensure that this will not be the last time you see Casablanca. The film will only keep growing stronger through the years. As new generations of filmmakers are born, there are a select number of films that can inspire. Casablanca certainly ranks high on the list.",10,0,2,19 June 2006
Finding Neverland," The Boy is Gone...
","A man stands alone pacing back and forth on a worn out carpet that is not foreign to this routine. It is opening night and James Barrie, well known author and playwright, anticipates a successful night, for it is the unveiling of his latest creation, Peter Pan.Johnny Depp has been on a roll since his last picture Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. In his latest film Finding Neverland, he plays James Barrie, a struggling author who has just produced an atrocity of a play. By chance he encounters a widow played by Kate Winslet (Titanic) and her three children having a pleasant time in the park. Barrie loves the chemistry between the children, but one of them, Peter, is sort of an outsider who never wants to be playful ever since his father died. Barrie gets an idea. The movie entails Barrie going on many adventures with the family with pirates and Indians right in the comfort of their backyards.Once again Depp deserves another nomination from the academy. The picture is a wonderful interpretation of the conception of the masterpiece that is Peter Pan, the story that children of all ages have come to know and love. Depp fits the role so perfectly that his Scottish accent seems almost too real. The movies flow is extremely well crafted. During some parts of the movie where imagination crosses with reality, whether it is 'finding Neverland' or dancing with a bear. The cinematography is unbelievable. The camera moves around as if it was a feather caught in an updraft. Flying a kite gives the viewer the sensation of hovering over the ground hundreds of feet in the air.Depp is known for his being a man with scissors for hands or a drug lord. As he says in the movie, 'The boy is gone.' The boy really is gone after this picture. Pirates of the Caribbean showed Depp's acting capabilities to a higher level, but Finding Neverland raises his status as Oscar worthy indeed. The Academy Awards will be interesting for sure with Depp, Jamie Foxx (Ray), Bill Murray (The Life Aquatic), and a lot of other worthy actors in the hunt for that little statue. The winner is still close to call at this point in time.This movie won't win Best Picture, but a nomination would not be a shocker at all. This movie features extremely good acting, music, and camera work. Kate Winslet puts forth a very good effort in her role. She did a better job in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but her performance in Finding Neverland is none the less well done. Not only do the headliners shine, but the children do as well. The casting department deserves an A for this project.Finding Neverland is a movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is not just another run of the mill movie about Peter Pan like the others are. This movie has made its mark in movie history and won't easily be forgotten. I give Finding Neverland a standing ovation.",9,0,0,1 July 2005
Star Trek," Set phasers to not that bad
","Filmmaker and television creator/producer J.J. Abrams has made quite a name for himself these past few years. His television series like Alias and Lost have established quite a fan based. In film he produced Cloverfield, a film I enjoyed unlike many others, and has directed two, Mission Impossible: III, and one of his more ambitious projects to date, Star Trek.This new installment starts at the beginning. It follows James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), starting from their youth and jumping into their beginnings with the Federation. Kirk is the rebellious and troubled youngster while Spock is, well, not really Spock. As I am to understand Spock is supposed to be emotionless but here we have someone who gets irritated, shows hatred, and actually shows some interest in women. I won't say who but it just doesn't seem right.All that aside, the first half of the film starts off great. There is intense action, a good direction for the story to go in, and some solid performances, surprisingly from Pike as Kirk. I thought he would be more like a teenager with pent up emotions and a lot of whining. He was the opposite really. Another great performance came from Karl Urban as Leonard 'Bones' McCoy. He was very on the mark with his character and didn't stray too far from the original McCoy, DeForest Kelley.Everything was in the right place for a great second half. The villain, Nero, played by Eric Bana, was not too over the top and the conflict was working. Then the film took a turn for the worst, delving into the very dicey and unpredictable area known as time travel. I won't give too much away but needless to say this was something not needed. It didn't completely ruin the film, but it was certainly a let down. It could have gone somewhere different and ended up in nearly the same spot.The effects were spectacular, but that was expected. The ships were very sleek and true to the original design (I think). My one qualm with the ships was for the majority of the film they were kind of dinky. They had weak weapons and were basically useless. The Enterprise was a little better but still, come on. In this country aren't things supposed to be super sized?The film finished nicely. It's a perfect jump off point for a sequel, which will most likely be made. Oddly enough, I think I will look forward to the sequel more than this film. As long as the story is good enough and doesn't go too far overboard, there is potential for a really nice looking followup.This wasn't perfect by any means. There were a lot of scenes that were unnecessary and the characters need to mature a little. That said, it was a solid effort and very entertaining, something a summer blockbuster needs to do. I'd say the film met my expectations, which weren't too high but were slightly above average, and will recommend it for most.",7,0,8,23 May 2009
Iron Man 2," A bit over the top, but still fun to watch
","Jon Favreau's followup to his 2008 smash hit Iron Man, based on the Marvel Comics superhero. We reunite with Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) right where we left him. He has announced to the world that he is indeed the man inside the suit of armor, and the world has never been safer because of it. Tony has run into a bit of a snag when the government tries taking the suit from him because they see it as a weapon, while Tony calls it a 'shield'. Meanwhile other copycats are attempted but fail, making the Iron Man suit a one of a kind, and therefore not a global threat.Well, like any good superhero story, a villain surfaces. Ivan Vanko (known in the comic book world as Whiplash, played here by Mickey Rourke), a Russian engineer whose father worked with Tony's father Howard. Vanko is out for redemption for what the Stark family has done to his, so in true evil villain fashion, Vanko tries to take out Stark with his own weapon design, only with some minor modifications.Back home in the US, Tony is bombarded with requests for his suit by the military, including his friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes a.k.a. War Machine (Don Cheadle). Tony is also feeling some pressure to join the organization S.H.I.E.L.D., a group spearheaded by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who is essentially creating a Justice League like group that in the comic book world includes Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, and Thor to name a few.The majority of the film focuses on Tony and what his legacy will be. Is the Iron Man a weapon or a shield for the country to get behind? Is it a hazard or a necessity? Tony must decide what is right for his company, his country, and himself. His faces congressional committees, the media, and terrorist threats. It's not an easy life for the man in the shiny suit.As far as sequels go this one is not bad. What I was hoping it would do that it failed to do was add something different to the franchise. The action in my opinion is worse. It's to forced and over the top, unlike the first film where the action meant something. He battled his way out of a cave of terrorists, he saved a village under attack, and he fought the man who tried to ruin his company and keep selling weapons to the rest of the world. Here he fights a swarm of robots, his friend, and a the main villain twice, the first of which is cool, the second being lame.I was pleased with the acting of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, one of Stark's competitors. Rockwell is building up an impressive body of work as of late (excluding Gentlemen Broncos) and this film is no exception. He is smarmy and gets under your skin. I was also pleased with Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson (plays Tony's assistant). Neither one annoyed me or took away from the main line of action.The real winner for me was the screenplay by Justin Theroux. Downey Jr. played his role perfectly and hit each line the way he should have. The only character who I thought lacked the most was Rourke's. I thought he was at a disadvantage to begin with because he spoke limited English and had a Russian accent. I wasn't a huge fan of him overall in the film. Not sure if it's the character or the actor. Either way, I could have done without him.What I am curious about is whether or not the Iron Man franchise will be done with. I am aware that The Avengers is in the works (the group of super hero mentioned earlier) so he will all but surely get a part in that. Whether or not he'll get a new movie by himself is up in the air for me. They need a really, really strong villain that has interesting abilities and can speak English.Overall a good movie. A little too much emphasis on product placement and neat gadgets, but a a good movie nonetheless. Those expecting a solid action packed thrill ride might be let down by the in between moments, but I think for the most part people can enjoy this film. No glaring flaws. Just a fun movie.",6,0,1,11 June 2010
World War Z," Don't give up
","At the end of World War Z, just as the credits began rolling, a gentleman, scratch that, an idiot spoke up from the back of the theatre exclaiming, 'What? That sucked! The book was nothing like that! Booo!' I'm sure he scurried away back home, logged online, and began tweeting, posting, and blogging, furthering his rant. Much like my response to him at the theatre, I hope he receives silence in return.It's true, World War Z is nothing like the book. The book is told from the point of view AFTER the war. It's a 'historical,' account of what happened during the war. Rather than make a mockumentary with flashbacks, which would have been the wrong decision in my opinion, the filmmakers decided to put us right in the middle of the action.When adapting a piece of literature it is impossible to bring every page, every paragraph, every nuance onto the screen. Some have come close depending on the material, but for the most part, they all have to take their own creative licenses. After all, it's called an 'adaptation,' for a reason, otherwise they would call it a copy or mimic.Where World War Z works (that's a mouthful) and where so many others fail is that just because the world slips into total and utter chaos, doesn't mean that governments, military, and law enforcement agencies go away. Quite the opposite. If anything, these scenarios bring out the best of all of them. We see generals, UN delegates, and scientists trying to solve complex issues that they don't know anything about. Rather than going into hiding, they act. Society doesn't crumble. Bands of cannibals and leather strapped gangs don't patrol the streets with necklaces made of teeth. People do what they can to survive, and the higher ups try their best to find a fast and effective solution.At first, I thought the movie started too fast. How could something this violent and concentrated go undetected, but after a while I got it. The opening montage of news reports said it all. How many of us listen to everything we hear on the news? Exactly. So much goes undetected while we focus on issues that effect us immediately. It's too late when the virus touches US soil. Not even social media can keep up with it.As far as zombie movies go this one is pretty great. Though I think 28 Days Later takes the cake in terms of realism, in-camera effects, and sheer terror, this one holds its own. Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is traveling with his family just as the zombie attack on Philadelphia unfolds. The film goes from 0-60 before you take a sip of your Coke. This is a fast paced, edge of your seat thrill ride led by one of the finest actors of this generation (Pitt's acting ability is far too underrated and lost in the kerfuffle of tabloid news).For those of you who stare at the ticket window debating whether or not to see a film in 3D or standard, you might want to spend the extra few dollars to see this one in 3D (I know it's asking a lot, but maybe you can sneak some candy or a bottle of water to offset the concession stand price - deal with it). I tend to air on the side of 'screw it, I want to see it in 3D.' Now not every movie NEEDS to be seen in 3D, hell there are really only a couple that absolutely have to be seen in all three dimensions (Avatar and maybe Life of Pi), but this one really surprised me. 3D is not about things jumping out at you, but it's about layers. Luckily this film has both. Big chase scenes in Philly, particles floating about in South Korea, and tracking shots in Jerusalem make this one of the 3D events of the year. No exaggeration.Like so many other summer blockbusters before it, civilization is on the brink of extinction and only a handful of experts can save us. What World War Z does that so many have failed is give us hope. Hope that humanity won't dissolve into nothingness. In the face of sheer danger these fighters stand tall, take a deep breath, look the enemy in the eye, and say, 'No.'",8,165,251,22 July 2013
12 Monkeys," There's no monkeying around when it comes to this movie
","Terry Gilliam is one of the original six members of the Monty Python cast. His works include Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian, and The Meaning of Life, where he helped direct two and helped write all of them. He also directed Jabberwocky where he used Lewis Carrol's poem and some of his Monty Python buddies to make a movie. In 1995, he decided to make a movie that was a little bit different.Inspired by a previous film called La Jetee, Twelve Monkeys is a science fiction thriller/drama that revolves around James Cole played by Bruce Willis. This man has 'volunteered' to go back in time to try and stop deadly virus from spreading, killing five billion people and leaving the animals in charge on the surface. He is first sent to the wrong time period, 1990. His destination was supposed to be 1996. Instead he winds up staying in a mental hospital. He becomes allies with a crazy man by the name of Jeffrey Goines. Brad Pitt is wonderful as this 'nutty' of a character. His portrayal of Jefferey gave him an Oscar nomination.What happens now is Bruce is transported finally to the right time period, after being brought back from the mental hospital. Now he must use his psychiatrist from the mental hospital, Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), and her car to try and stop the virus from getting out into the open. Cole must now find out if what he thinks is reality is just all in his head and he really isn't being brought back and forth from the present to the past, or as Railly sees it, from the future back to the present.This story is very well written. Writer David Webb Peoples is no rookie when it comes to writing a screenplay. His previous triumphs were Blade Runner, thought to be one of the best science fiction movies of all time, and Unforgiven where he received an Oscar nomination.Twelve Monkeys is a great movie you can watch over and over again and still find something to like. Whether it is Brad Pitt giving his best performance ever on film, or just the plot and how Gilliam illustrates it for us, this movie is a classic. There's no monkeying around when it comes to this movie",8,4,5,10 July 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Yo ho, yo ho, this movie is for me!
","I can remember going to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida as a little kid and there were certain attractions that stood out in my mind. One of the best was Pirates of the Caribbean located in Adventure Land. This swashbuckling adventure into the heart of a pirate raid and imagination. The ride depicts pirates pillaging, drinking, eating, and having what seems to be a successful raid.In Gore Verbinski's epic tale of a cursed ship and its crew trying to find their lost treasure, johnny Depp stars as the worst pirate ever, Captain Jack Sparrow. He encounters Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) after escaping from an island prison and his love interest Elizabeth Swann (Neira Knightley). The three find themselves in quite the mess.When the Black Pearl sails into port, all hell breaks loose. Led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), these pirates will do whatever it takes to find their treasure. After taking Elizabeth away because she has the missing piece, Will and Jack must find a crew brave enough, or dumb enough to chase the Pearl.The story featuring scenes from the ride in Walt Disney World and Walt Disney Land in California, causing this film will trigger a lot of memories for fans of the ride. The film also tells a great story with action, romance, and comedy. Depp is brilliant as mumbling, sometimes heroic Jack Sparrow, getting himself nominated for an Academy Award.Another interesting aspect of the movie that is well done is the computer generated effects like when the pirates are seen in their 'true form'. This gives the movie an eye candy effect, bringing in more viewers.Overall, this film is spectacular. Appealing on all levels of cinema entertainment. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a movie not to be missed. In the words of Jack Sparrow, 'Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate,'. This one is no exception.",8,0,2,5 July 2005
Public Enemies," Gangster's Paradise
","In true Michael Mann fashion, he has given the 1930s a reboot with his action infused, crime drama about the rise and fall of one of America's most notorious Gangster's, John Dillinger. This film has all the clothing, cars, and guns a film about the 30s could ask for. I've heard this film called an action movie, but really it's not. Granted the action is top of the line and possibly the most memorable aspect of the film, but it's not a complete action-packed extravaganza.John Dillinger was the result of the gang scene from Chicago led by Al Capone during the prohibition era. Dillinger started somewhat small and grew to national fame, catching the attention of the FBI for his lightning quick robberies and evasions from law enforcement. He was efficient, skilled, and ready for anything. He could pick up sticks and be gone within minutes. This film is a great cat and mouse chase through banks, city streets, and back roads as the law tries to put a stop to the country's 'public enemy number one.'To start with the cast you have to look first at Johnny Depp. I've read that Depp was truly excited about this role, feeling really well connected with the character of John Dillinger. He is cool, collected, and knows exactly what his character is about. First and foremost he plays a gangster. Regardless how you might feel about him, he is a bad guy. He might seem like a Robin Hood of sorts from time to time, but he really is a bad guy with manners.To be honest I expected a little more from Depp. He doesn't really play up the character too much. Maybe I'm just comparing it to his recent performances as a pirate, demon barber, and chocolate factory owner, all of which are over the top. It's almost like his character from Donnie Brasco. Nothing over the top, but a solid performance. His actions speak louder than his words, and some of his dialogue is pretty amazing.Moving on to some of the surprises in the cast, I was very impressed with Christian Bale as Agent Melvin Purvis of the FBI. His southern accent and old fashioned approach make him a very unlikable but slightly admirable character, especially with his rifle. Alongside Bale and even more impressive was Billy Crudup as the head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover. He looked perfect for the part, his voice was outstanding, and his overall presence on screen was much like that of Hoover; intimidating. He added some much needed support from the cast.Academy Award Winning actress Marion Cotillard (La vie en rose) gives a fine performance as Depp's love interest Billie. She didn't blow me away like in La vie en rose, but she still did a good job especially with her American accent. She played someone who was part French and there is just a hint of the accent, making her character more believable. Other than that she did just enough.What Michael Mann film would be complete without a mind boggling shootout? Mann's debacle of Miami Vice left a sour taste in my mouth for several reasons. He has regained my trust here and in large part to his use of weaponry and special effects. The guns are real, the sounds are deafening, and the action is intense. It doesn't meet the standard Mann set with his film Heat, featuring one of the greatest shootout ever filmed, but this has one of his best. There are no wasted bullets here. Each shot is carefully aimed as if they were really trying to do some damage.Another feature of the Mann experience is the camera work. He always makes on a beautiful looking picture. The camera is a little too jerky for my liking in this movie, but on the whole the shots and angles are perfectly set up, bringing close to the action, forcing us to watch the mayhem and intensity of the scene. It's not just the action that looks incredible. The car scenes, dinners, and all of the in between scenes look stunning as well. It's a testament to the art director as well as the cinematographer.It's not the best gangster film I've seen, but it's one of the most original films of the genre. There wasn't a whole lot wrong with the film. It has a fantastic cast, great soundtrack, and amazing effects and action sequences. It runs a little too long but nothing too lengthy to handle. It's a must-see for the summer, and keep your eyes peeled for this one around award season.",9,1,2,7 July 2009
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Why does something so wrong feel so right?
","Trey Parker and Matt Stone really are sick guys. Making Sidam Hussein Satan's gay lover...where did they think that up? It doesn't matter because this movie was phenomenal.South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut has taken the American people on a joy ride through heaven, hell, and Colorado. The boys we have come to know and love on Comedy Central find a new home on the big screen. Stan Marsh, Kyle Broslofski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick are bigger, better, and uncensored in this movie...and it's wonderful. Four fourth graders singing, dancing, and swearing like there is no tomorrow make one hell of a cast.The story starts off with the release of the new Terrance and Phillip movie, Asses of Fire. This creates such a shock-wave that Kyle's mother gets the two Canadian superstars arrested and put in the electric chair during a USO show. It is so similar to what parents go through whenever they find something offensive and think their children are in danger.Once Satan finds out that the US and Canada are at war, he and his lover Sidam Hussein...that's right...decide it is the perfect time to unleash hell on earth. Kenny finds out because he is dead and sent to hell. Surprised he is dead? Didn't think so. It's his job to warn his friends of the incoming danger. What results from all this chaos is non stop hilarity.What makes this movie so amazing is that it isn't just a South Park movie...it's basically a South Park Musical! Trey and Matt have written an entire movie's worth of songs. Each one funnier than the next. The Academy Award nominated song, 'Blame Canada', performed by Robin Williams at the Oscars and by Kyle's mother in the movie, is incredible.The madness doesn't stop with the singing and the dancing, the censorship on TV is no more and the kids like the F-bombs fly...and more...and worse. Hearing fourth graders cuss like that is too much and makes the movie very enjoyable.South Park: Bigger Better & Uncut is one of the best guilty pleasures around and everyone should take part in it at least some time in their lifetime. It is a timeless epic film done in animation. Although Phil Collins beat South Park out for the Oscar with his song from Disney's Tarzan, this movie is a winner.",10,9,10,3 July 2005
127 Hours," Push it to the limit
","In 127 Hours, we follow Ralston, played by James Franco, a person who lives life to the fullest and on his terms. His lifestyle pushes others away, but for him that's okay, a choice that will haunt him. While taking a weekend trip to Blue John Canyon, Ralston finds himself in the precarious situation of having his arm wedged under a boulder. With limited supplies, Ralston must find the best way out of this mess, all the while ensuring his survival. With some rope, tethers, a cheap multi-tool, and headlamp, he goes through trial after trial of attempting to free his arm.Entering the film, I was curious as to the techniques Boyle would employ to keep us invested. After all, watching a guy under a rock for five days sounds like an Andy Warhol film. I was expecting to see cutaways to people who would be looking for him. We soon find out that no one knows he is there. Then I realized that Boyle's angle is to put us in that canyon trapped under the very same boulder. Our only advantage over Ralston is that we can move freely in our seats pain free, though we go through each event be it drinking water, urinating, stretching for sunlight, or doing the unthinkable of removing one's limb.By putting us in the canyon, our minds start to race, much like Ralston. His only escape is through his camcorder with which he documents his time, and with his endless parade of thoughts and memories, both good and bad. Imagine having that much time by yourself and the flood of memories and emotions that would creep into your head. It's mind boggling and borderline disorienting to think about. Through Franco's performance we see how this forced isolation influences ones thoughts so much.Franco, much like the boulder on top of his arm, is rock solid throughout the film. The opening sequences show his free spirited nature and inability to stay on the ground let alone in one place. He whizzes around the canyon, confident with every step and every peddle of his bicycle. Once trapped in the canyon, he is confined to staying put, something his character is not used to. Franco was so convincing that I forgot about the character and focused on my own emotions. He did many of the things I saw myself doing with the same expressions. As the film progresses we feel every emotion and sense every sensation.To help with this process, Boyle employs creative camera shots, sound effects, and editing techniques. Due to the cramped space, Boyle puts the camera in virtually every crevice and height imaginable, including shots from inside his water bottle and even one inside his arm. Each movement is accompanied by a slew of sounds that intensify and bombard our senses. One in particular utilizes an electric guitar buzz when Ralston attempts at severing a nerve. Cut all of this with editing straight from a Jason Bourne film and you have an intense, dramatic sequence of events that keeps the audience engaged.On an estimated budget of around 18 million dollars, Boyle utilizes his leading actor, Franco, his beautiful locations in Utah, and an incredible arsenal of editing points, coverage shots, and foley artistry to create a portrait of a lone man pushed to the edge. Like so many of Boyle's characters, they are presented with an obstacle, be it a zombie onslaught or a game show, and we are able to see how the choices they make both in the present situation and in their prior experiences influence and determine their ultimate outcome.Ralston is confronted with the idea of his entire life's journey has led him to this rock at this time and in this place, leading to the conclusion that everything happens for a reason. As for Boyle, we're all thankful for the path he has chosen.",9,2,6,19 November 2010
Pirate Radio," Long live rock n' roll!
","It's hard to imagine a world without rock and roll, but just a little over forty years ago it was considered by many to be offensive, rebellious, and a storm on the horizon. The 'establishment' hadn't come to terms yet with this musical force, and that is the story of The Boat That Rocked.Released under the title of Pirate Radio in North America, this is a fictionalized story about the rise of rock in the 1960s and the people who passed on the good vibrations to millions of listeners. This isn't strictly about people vs. the government, but about music, love, friendship, and freedom.We are brought aboard the ship Radio Rock, the home of Britain's popular pirate radio station. Carl (Tom Sturrige), an adolescent, joins the crew of rogue disc jockeys and music enthusiasts in an attempt by his mother to find some direction in his life with the guidance of his godfather Quentin (Bill Nighy), the head of Radio Rock. If Carl's mother wanted him to have some sort of direction, the only direction he will find here is on the compass, and I question even that.Carl encounters The Count (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), an American DJ whose passion for rock is matched by nothing else, except maybe women, but that is a close call. The Count is one of a host of other passionate DJs and rebellious rockers aboard the ship. But all is not well in the pirate radio business. The powers that be are doing all they can to shut the boat and others like it down. Sir Alistair Dormandy (Kenneth Branagh) leads the movement against the radio rockers, trying to make it illegal for them to broadcast in the open waters.What I like so much about this film is how the story takes a free form like the lifestyle these rockers live by. The struggle between the government and rockers is prevalent throughout, but the random activities, encounters, and altercations are what make the movie so special. The random dances, sexual encounters with fans, and abundant supply of music are more than enough to please.This film has a fantastic ensemble cast headed by Nighy, Hoffman, Branagh, Nick Frost, Rhys Darby, Rhys Ifan, and an excellent cameo by Emma Thompson. Without their great efforts in bringing their characters to life, the film would have sunk, pun intended.I was very surprised by this one. It's a great ensemble comedy that has a lot to offer to a lot of people.",9,2,4,29 November 2009
Finding Nemo," Just keep swimming...
","Can Pixar and Disney miss with a film? Both Toy Story's, A Bugs Life, Monster's Inc., Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles. These movies are instant classics.The movie in focus is Finding Nemo, a story of a clown fish named Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks), trying to find his son Nemo who was taken away by scuba divers. With the help of a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres)Marlin bumps into on his journey, they set out on finding Nemo. The only problem is that Dory suffers from short-term memory loss. She can't remember anything except her name. It's sad but brings a lot of comedy to the movie.Along the way they meet some priceless characters like Crush (voiced by writer/director Andrew Stanton), the thrill seeking sea turtle. They also encounter a trio of friendly sharks, Bruce, Anchor, and Chum. They have sworn to never eat a fish again. They also run into some potentially deadly situations with an ugly deep sea fish, also a huge swarm of jellyfish, and a whale. Marlin and Dory must tough it out and make it to find Nemo.Meanwhile, Nemo is now the new addition to an Australian dentist's office aquarium. There he meets some interesting characters. Peach the starfish, Bloat the blowfish, and more sea dwellers. There Nemo tries to fit in, becoming a member of the tank named 'Shark Bait'. He tries to help out Gill (William Defoe) with his plan to escape from the tank and get everyone out. Nemo must come through in order to see his father ever again. A local pelican named Nigel (Geoffrey Rush) also tries to help out in the escape. Word has spread around the world of Marlin's trip to find his son, reaching Nigel.FInding Nemo is an instant classic. With great lines and unforgettable characters, this movie is a delight. The animation itself is remarkable. It's as though the fish are really swimming. You can even see particles floating in the water. Light shines through and currents make the fish and surrounding react. The animators have done their homework for this picture.This movie is quite an experience. It is a film the whole family can enjoy for years to come. It is a timeless adventure that people can enjoy.

","Keanu Reeves has found his look in his new movie Constantine as John Constantine, a man wanted by the devil and rejected by God, trying to buy his way into heaven by sending demons back to where they came from.Along with Reeves (The Matrix trilogy) is Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Enemy at the Gates) as Angela Dodson, a young detective who mourns the loss of her twin sister Isabel, also played by Weisz. The two cross paths when Isabel commits suicide, which Angela can't conceive as possible, for her sister is a devout Catholic. Reeves with his ability to see demons and angels will help Angela find out what happens to her sister after her death and essentially save the world from being taken over by the spawn of Satan.Reeves gives a performance that will satisfy audiences, with witty remarks and a will to do anything. Constantine's smoking makes him not a superhero, but just another person with lung trouble. A character some folks can relate to makes him likable and not appalling.The character John Constantine first appeared in the DC comic series Swamp Thing as a background character developed to look like the artist Sting, and evolved into a mentor to Swamp Thing. In 1987, the series Hellblazer was introduced and would be passed onto British writer Jamie Delano, bringing Constantine to life. The series attracted a cult following.The first time director Francis Lawrence changes the pace from directing music videos for Brittany Spears and Aerosmith to making movies. This attempt at recreating DC Comics Hellblazer comic series is one that fans will love, but others might be turned off.Lawrence's attempt at bringing Constantine to life works. The edgy and mysterious Constantine has a presence that is quite powerful, much like Batman. His reckless attitude are fueled by his unknown origins and interesting barrage of weapons used to drag demons out of people and 'deport' them back to hell.Lawrence uses the eyes of the characters very well, giving demons a red hue, and angels a gold coloration. This minor detail gives them more of an evil and menacing look to them. The special effects department did its job very nicely. Whether it be heaven, earth, or hell, the effects will please everyone.The movie uses religious symbolism a lot. The movie takes place in Los Angeles or 'The City of Angels' if translated into Spanish. The characters Angela, which sounds a lot like angel, and Constantine, who was the first catholic Holy Roman Emperor, also have religious connections.The movie isn't completely well done. The beginning of the movie leaves you confused and unsure of what's going on. The action is present way too early. After the opening scene of a man being crushed by a car and walking away, Reeves casts a demon out of a little girl. Why or how he did this is a mystery until later on in the movie when his identity is made known. Not everything should be explained, but there are certain aspects that need to be explained. Overall the movie was very good. This isn't a movie for everyone, though. Only people who enjoy comic book movies or are looking for a more involved action movie would want to see this. The action is great, a story line that goes well with the comic book series, but the subject matter is not intended for all audiences. This movie is worth the money.",7,0,7,1 July 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Forbidden Love
","When it comes to movies, forbidden love is a very common theme. Classics like Casablanca, American Beauty, and even Some Like it Hot have elements of this theme throughout. Countless romantic comedies or 'chick flicks' have based the entire story on this premise and nothing else.The producers of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind present an Ang Lee, director of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Ice Storm, has added a new, controversial film to this genre. Brokeback Mountain is an extremely emotional and intense film about two ranchers who after spending one fateful summer in 1963 together on Brokeback Mountain fall in love.Ennis, played by Heath Ledger (The Patriot), is the roughneck cowboy who is just trying to earn some extra money over the summer. He winds up working with Jack, Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko), a soft-spoken boy who is also looking for a summer job. The two must keep watch over a heard of sheep for three months in the area of Wyoming known as Brokeback Mountain.When a freak blizzard hits, the weather turns cold up on Brokeback and instead of having one sleep in the tent and the other sleeping near the sheep, the two shack up for warmth, but what happens is not what the two expected. In what can only be described as a passionate love scene, is the turning point of the picture.After their engagement is cut short, they say farewell and go their separate ways. The next summer, the employer who gave them the job last summer (Randy Quaid, Independence Day) found out how they were 'passing the time'.Jump to four years later, Ennis has a wife Alma, Michelle Williams (Dick) and two children, living in a cramped apartment. Jack is working with his wife Lureen, Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries), selling heavy farm equipment. Jack writes Ennis telling him he is coming down to see him. Upon their meeting, Alma catches the two being a little too familiar with each other. From here on out she must hide his secret without him or their children knowing.The rest of the film features several rendezvous back to Brokeback and the complications their wives create and the world they live in. It spans several years with each year bringing more conflict and hurt. Jack wishes they had never fallen for each other saying, 'I wish I knew how to quit you!' several times.Lee's direction is stellar to say none-the-less. He uses the panoramic landscape of the Canadian wilderness as his Brokeback Mountain stage. The vivid color is very romantic. It really brings out the emotion and passion emanating from the two actors. Lee's previous works have similar concepts with nature as a great element to have.Ledger and Gyllenhaal, both nominated for Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively), shine as two men lost in a world that can't accept them as lovers. As they get older, their relationship becomes more and more complicated. The most important part of their acting that makes this movie stand out is they make the story not about gay lovers, but about two lovers. Straight or gay, their acting is so compelling it doesn't matter what their orientation would be.Brokeback Mountain is a modern classic that speaks volumes. It has power beyond explanation. Lee presents a story about love that conquers all boundaries. Thanks to Lee's ambitious film making, the doorway has been opened up for filmmakers everywhere to pursue their dreams.",10,25,29,2 February 2006
Terminator Salvation," This franchise has been terminated
","I've been disappointed going into summer blockbusters. Just last year the fourth Indiana Jones film was released and left me a little downtrodden, but not completely miserable. Lest we forget the catastrophe that was Spider-Man 3. I shudder at the mention of this film. What a flop! That said, I would have to place this film up there with summer let downs. Not a huge let down like spidey did, but it was more so than Indy.The film starts with the execution of death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), whose character will come back later on. Jump several years later to 2018. A time when Skynet has completely taken over the world, unleashing a plethora of human killing machines. The survivors are a part of the Resistance. Christian Bale play John Connor, the so- called prophet of the Resistance whose whole existence has been linked to this great war.Marcus comes back and meets up with Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who will eventually go back in time to become the father of John Connor (this is explained early on, as well as in the original Terminator movie). He is taken prisoner as Marcus meets up with Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), a Resistance fighter pilot who had to ditch during an air battle. The two try to make it back to Connor.The majority of the film is filled with endless and often needless action, showing off an arsenal of special effects from stunt driving to explosions and of course, CGI. As cool and shiny as some of the effects are, it takes away from the flow of the story. Fight scenes interrupt the plot too often and we are left there sitting, watching bullets fly and barrels blow up.Director McG, whose work includes both Charlie's Angels movies, We Are Marshall, and assorted music videos. The likely choice to direct such a bold and incredibly large scale project would be this man. To his credit, he didn't do a terrible job. It wasn't a great job, but he was not the reason behind this movie failing to meet the hype. He put several hero shots of Bale that are so obvious and unnecessary.The blame rests partly on the acting. Worthington plays a solid character who should have been developed more. He also goes in and out of his Australian accent a bit too much. Bale puts on a lackluster performance, being too cold and heartless, instead of heroic like he has been told he would be. There is also a big credit given to Common in the opening credits. He plays a minor character and to add onto that, he doesn't play it well. It's just a face and a name with little acting going on. He was much better in Ridley Scott's American Gangster.The writing took a nose dive from the beginning. Quick one-liners and on the nose dialogue take away from the film far too often. Too many lines from the previous Terminator films are used in painfully obvious ways (the audience, myself included, couldn't hold it together for 'I''ll be back.') It was dull, tacky, and lacked the passion of the first too films.One scene in particular made me feel like I was watching a stunt spectacular. There were explosions, bullets flying through the air, and a motorcycle jump that was completely unnecessary.There is a lot wrong with this film obviously. The technology used by the machines seems far more advanced than in the other films, but I don't think it's that far into the future because Kyle Reese is only a teenager. How is it that the terminators can withstand molten metal, a point that clearly made in Terminator 2? There are so many things that don't add up from a technology and history standpoint. If this film were placed on a timeline with the others, parts wouldn't add up. It was very rushed.There are some good things, I guess. Danny Elfman did a fine job with the score. He is pretty reliable for big budget films, especially with Tim Burton. This type is film isn't usually what he works with. I guess great composers can meet just about any task. Other bright spots are Yelchin's performance (not great, but solid), and some of the camera work/CGI shots are impressive. Nothing like Transformers, but definitely enjoyable.I guess after the recorded rant that was leaked involving Christian Bale and a crew member was a bad omen for this film. It will still gross a lot of money but I don't think it will reach epic proportions. At least I hope not. I'm pulling for Disney's Up to take the number one spot next week.",6,0,2,23 May 2009
500 Days of Summer," Redefining the genre
","Love. One of most confusing words in the English language. A person can love another person, a sandwich, a car, a feeling, and a host of other things, people, and places. Love. Just four letters that mean so much.In Marc Webb's directorial debut (500) Days of Summer, we find out exactly what love is. A while ago I saw the trailer for this film and it came with a warning: 'This is not a love story. This is a story about love.' This could not have been a truer statement.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen. He is currently employed at a greeting cards company in Los Angeles but dreams of making it as an architect, someday. His life is rather ordinary until he meets his boss' new secretary, Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. After their first encounter, Summer is the only thing that Tom can think of. He knows that this is the girl, this is 'the one'. Tom believes that love is out there waiting for him. Summer on the other hand feels the opposite, that true love belongs in songs and fairy tales. What happens when these two ideals collide?The resulting relationship the two embark on is unlike any other put on celluloid. It's a beautiful, tragic, comic, musical, whimsical tale of love, heartache, and life lessons. Each era of film has 'the couple' that reflect the ideals and mannerisms of the time. There was Roman Holiday, The Graduate, When Harry Met Sally, Singles, and up until now, Garden State. Here comes the next generation of lovers. This film shows the intimate details of a modern day romance from dating to the bedroom.There is so much I want to say but can't because it would spoil not just the story but the fun. Webb employs some unique storytelling techniques. Each scene offers something new both stylistically as well as changing the direction of the film ever so slightly. Along the way we bounce back and forth in Tom and Summer's relationship showing the highs and lows and everything in between.Webb's unique style appears to be influenced by several other directors. There are a few homages to other films and movements, something I enjoyed immensely. I sensed that Goddard, Fellini, Minnelli, and a few others were inspiration for certain scenes.One thing Webb does right is use his actors correctly. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are magical on screen together. They make each scene worth while with their delivery and on screen presence. No lines are wasted, no looks go unnoticed. They nail the mood and purpose of the film.I cannot stress enough how amazing and important the soundtrack is in this film. Like The Graduate or Garden State, we have a great selection of songs, each serving both an entertainment and story telling purpose. Songs from artists like The Smiths, Regina Spektor, The Temper Trap, and Hall & Oates give the film a way to communicate with the audience on more than one level.I can't stress enough how amazing (500) Days of Summer really is. It's a new twist on a tired genre of indie romance films. It has everything you could possibly want from a film. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. It's a remarkable achievement, especially for such a small production. Bravo Mr. Webb. I greatly anticipate your next film.",10,2,3,27 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," All good things must come to an end...
","The summer blockbuster. Those films that are so highly anticipated all winter long that millions of people around the world flock to cinemas and spend millions and millions of dollars just to see what all the buzz is about. Fortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is worth the price of admission. Director Gore Verbinski did the right thing in holding true to the story, bringing back all of the characters and not introducing too many new ones.When we last left our band of pirates, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was eat by the Cracken, a giant squid that terrorizes sea-faring vessels, and was sent to Davey Jones Locker. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and the rest of their pirate brigade, must bring together all of the pirate lords from the four corners of the world and try to combat Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company for control over the seas. There is one problem; Depp is one of the pirate lords and all nine are needed.The crew must travel to the end of the world to get Depp and bring him back to complete the Pirate counsel and make a decision on what to do about Davey Jones. They all band together along with Chow-Yun Fat as Captain Sao Feng whose pirates derive from Singapore.The first half of the film is dry in parts, but with Depp and Rush back at the helm, it is hard to go wrong. There are some very interesting scenes with Depp battling his own conscience and trying to stay 'sane'. The second half really picks up and erupts into a climactic battle of epic proportions on the open sea.The flow of the film is steady and twists and turns enough to slightly confuse you, but in the end it all makes sense and that feeling of being lost is gone. Alliances are broken and new ones are formed as the final showdown gathers into a fantastic storm of edge of your seat action.Verbinski finishes off the trilogy using the same techniques that worked on the two previous films; a hefty dose of computer effects and witty one liners. Additional swooping shots showcase the grand scale of the film and how far Verbinski and Disney Pctures goes to bring this world to life.The one downside like the second film in the series had was the running time. This one goes for a whopping 168 minutes and it hits you. After the final frame, a feeling of exhaustion sweeps over you. DON'T LEAVE AFTER THE CREDITS! Stay for the bonus scene. It gives the series a nice wrap up.No, there shouldn't be a Pirates of the Caribbean 4. Like all blockbuster hits, there is a limit to how far you can go (i.e. Jurassic Park. Love the first, not the rest). At World's End is a solid finale to one of the most successful trilogies of all time.",7,1,3,6 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Recipe for Disaster
","A recipe is a step-by-step process that if followed correctly will produce a satisfying outcome. When all the elements are added properly and put together and made in the right order, you cannot go wrong. However, sometimes, measurements can be misread, ingredients forgotten, and foreign substances making their way in. This produces an unwanted product. The third installment to the Spider-Man saga is a perfect example for a misread recipe.Spider-Man 3 is one of the biggest let downs that cinema has seen. The first two films had everything done correctly. The script, the characters, the storyline, the director, and all of the little odds and ends that came together somehow did not appear in the third film. Everything that could have gone wrong did.To place this film in the comic book genre would only fit for the characters and the creators. The film isn't action or suspense, but romance. The wonder and awe of watching Spidey fly through the air was non-existent and for the scenes that did have action, it was all repetition. Punch, kick, web, thrown person into a steel girder or metal pole over and over again. There was nothing that stood out in this film like the previous films had.The story goes that Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) wants to marry Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but Spider-Man's popularity is getting in the way of his relationship with MJ. His best friend from high school turned mortal enemy Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still trying to find a way to kill Spidey, but a certain turn of events will make things difficult.New photographer Eddie Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) wants to beat out Peter for a new job at the Daily Bugle while Brock's girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) becomes entangled in Spidey's web and also with her schoolmate Peter. To top off the list of new editions is Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who escapes from prison after being charged with the murder of Ben Parker, Peter's uncle who was killed in the first film. While on the lamb, Marko stumbles into a scientific testing facility where he is accidentally mutated into a superhuman comprised of sand.Making matters worse, an alien sludge attaches itself to Peter and transforms him into a meaner, more aggressive Spidey and Peter as well. Whatever the substance comes in contact with, it is hard to remove it.All of the ingredients are ready to mix and transform. One thing is in the way; the script. Director Sam Raimi has done a magnificent job directing the first two installments, but decides to take a stab at writing the screenplay. This is where our creation starts to deteriorate. Poorly assembled dialogue and awkward scenes make it hard to watch the film without laughing or just shaking your head in embarrassment.The story is another malfunction of the film. There is too much cheesy and cliché romance and not enough Spider-Man. I never thought it was possible to turn a comic book movie into a 'chick flick'. Every characters cries at one point or another and I mean every character. There is also a segment that is wildly hilarious but horribly out of place involving the 'new' Peter Parker that is charged with energy, dance moves, and one-liners. It is something out of a disco movie!Why did this happen? When you make chocolate chip cookies you don't replace the vanilla with teriyaki sauce. Follow the recipe, and add things that make sense. Spider-Man will most likely be one of the highest grossing films of the year. It attracts a wide variety of moviegoers and countless die hard fans. But with the quality of the film and all of the disappointing elements, will this be the end of Spider-Man on the big screen?",4,123,246,4 May 2007
The Prestige," Seeing is Believing
","The ability to fool a large group of people. The power to force someone into seeing something. The art of illusion. Illusionists, magicians, no matter what they are called they consider themselves one thing; performers. To be the best means to work the hardest and to commit fully to an act. Sometimes, the illusion becomes too real.How far will someone go for power? How much is enough? How far are you willing to go? In turn of the century London, filmmaker Christopher Nolan brings answers these questions and brings us into a world full of betrayal, murder, and of course, magic. Two rival magicians vie for power to see who really is the best. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) along with his associate Cutter (Sir Michael Caine) are puzzled by Robert's former colleague's latest trick. Alfred (Christian Bale) has unveiled a brilliant new illusion that defies expectation. Robert's assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) is willing to do anything for him, even infiltrate Alfred's act.This feuding was the result of a trick gone wrong involving Robert's wife. Alfred appeared to be the one to blame and Robert never let it go. Rather than leaving the past behind, the two go back and forth to try and out perform the other on stage and off. What was once a friendship has turned into an all out war of secrets. Robert, who will give anything to outsmart his competitor, travels all the way to America to seek the help of a scientist and pull off the amazing trick his own way.Nolan after the success of Batman Begins reunites with Bale and Caine to tackle a new setting. Nolan's previous works of notoriety, Memento and Insomnia, all have a similar edge to them. The Prestige is not different. The storyline is jumpy, going from present to the beginning, to the middle, and all over the place. Pieced together, the flow makes sense and is a joy to undertake.With a solid script from Nolan and his brother Jonathon, all that was needed was a cast. Academy Award winner Caine, along with Jackman, Bale, Johansson, and a cameo by David Bowie, make The Prestige marvelous. Exceptional performances by Jackman and Bale make the rivalry intense and exciting.The story strictly speaking is superb. The Nolan brothers have delivered once again. Their style and flow are truly original. It is hard to jump around in a film and pass on the message and information as cleanly as possible. The story leads up to a dramatic and climactic ending that will not soon be forgotten.The Prestige is not a run of the mill birthday magic show. It is a fantastic voyage into the realm of magic, both the light the dark sides.",8,1,3,22 October 2006
Hotel Rwanda," One of the Most Moving Pictures Ever!
","For a while now, there have been uprisings in Africa, most of the time, it is quite violent. In Tears of the Sun starring Bruce Willis, the problem in Nigeria was put into perspective. It was shown through the eyes of the US military trying to rescue a couple of select people but end up bringing back refugees. Hotel Rwanda takes a different path, shown through the eyes of those under attack.Hotel Rwanda is based on a true story out of Rwanda, Africa. It is a country gripped by war and oppression. When a four-star hotel is now thrown right into the mix of things, manager Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) has to make a very important decision. He must decide whether or not to let Tutsi's live in his hotel to take refuge from the Hutu soldiers.The problem is that the Hutu's, a tribe of Africans in Rwanda, are taking control and want to exterminate the Tutsis, a rival tribe. This hostile take over is one that spreads all over Paul's town. One night over a radio broadcast, the Hutu militia's leader told all of his soldiers to find and eliminate the Tutsis. Now, Paul, his wife Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), who is a Tutsi, and their children must stay in the hotel and watch over all of the 'new guests'. With Paul paying off the leader of the Hutu militia, General Bizimungu, he tries to keep his hotel out of harms way.When he runs out of ideas and aid from the General and from the United Nations, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), and the media, he must defend his hotel by finding a way to get those refugees out of there and keep his family safe at the same time. Paul is faced with heart breaking decisions and must stay strong so he doesn't show weakness or give up the Tutsis.Cheadle's performance is breathtaking. When everything seems to be coming apart and he might lose it, he has to hold it together. Cheadle's character sees things that shouldn't be seen by anyone. So much death and destruction in one area can have an impact on a man. With scenes that are similar to Schindler's List, this movie is powerful and really shows how little people have known about the crisis in Rwanda.Hotel Rwanda was nominated for three Academy Awards for Best Actor (Cheadle), Best Supporting Actress (Okonedo), and Best Original Screenplay. Although it didn't win, the movies message was carried across and brought attention to the devastation in Africa.Hotel Rwanda is a masterpiece and is one of the most moving films of all time. It leaves nothing behind and shows you everything. It will be looked at for years to come. Hotel Rwanda opens will open your eyes.",9,3,4,9 July 2005
Elf," 'Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?'
","Christmas movies go into two categories. There are the ones that become classics and sometimes become a part of a family's Christmas tradition. Then there are the ones that are just there for the season, like the ones made for TV or just some that have been forgotten. This movie is definitely one that will become an instant success in your house around the holidays.Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) who is essentially the spirit of Christmas as we like to see it. Buddy is a human living in the North Pole because he found his way into Santa's sack of toys. Growing up around elves, he began to notice some differences between him and the other elves. When Buddy's adoptive father Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tells Buddy that he isn't an elf, he sets out on a journey to New York City to find his father Walter (James Caan), the publisher of children's books who doesn't really know the meaning of Christmas.During his time in NYC, Buddy shacks up with Walter and his family. He gets a job working as a department store worker in their Christmas department. There he meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), the girl who catches Buddy's eye with her kindness and great personality. Buddy tries to get his father off of Santa's naughty list and bring his family closer together.Ferrell is absolutely perfect as Buddy. His childish character is hilarious and what better than letting a 'kid' run free in New York City. A place full of new experiences like traffic, rotating glass doors, and elevators. His character really does embody the spirit of Christmas. To be good, sing songs, and celebrate. Although Christmas has gone commercial, this movie is a great way to feel good around the holidays. The relationship between Buddy and his father is an awkward one at first, but grows over time. Whenever they are near each other it is a laugh riot. Ferrell is always hilarious and truly makes the movie. Nobody could have been Buddy better than Will.Elf is a joy to watch over and over again. Soon after you see it you will be quoting it all day long. It's addictive in a good way. Ferrell has been on a roll with movies as of late and this is a Will at his best. He makes being a big kid look easy and fun. Elf has comedy and is appropriate for the whole family. This movie will make you feel all warm inside even in the North Pole. Elf is a winner.",8,1,2,27 July 2005
Shutter Island," Scorsese thrills and chills
","Shutter Island is based on the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the man who penned Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone. Needless to say this film too takes place in Boston, Lehane's stomping grounds, but this time we go outside of the city limits and into Boston Harbor. Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at a hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. He and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) must gather the facts, find some clues, and see what exactly happened to this missing patient.Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) runs the show on Shutter Island. He oversees all activities with the doctors, nurses, orderlies, and guards. It is his idea that the patients on the island are not prisoners but people who are in desperate need of help through more humane means. Teddy and Chuck soon find out that not all is as it seems on the island. It's as if everyone has a secret and is scared to tell.To make matters worse, Teddy suffers from nightmares and flashbacks about his wife (Michelle Williams) and her sudden death in an apartment fire. He tries to pull it together but the line between what is real and what is in his head slowly starts to blur, causing him to lose sight of what he is really on the island to do.With the help of a tight screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis (Night Watch, Alexander, Pathfinder) and spectacular cinematography by one of the best in the business, Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2, The Aviator), Scorsese is able to deliver a solid, psychological thriller. Starting with the script, I was happy that it wasn't just an exercise in exploiting the Boston accent, like too many movies and TV shows have done of late. It also does a nice job of keeping us involved with the story. Especially with thrillers, it is very easy to lose your audience if you present an idea or a plot point that is too over their head. Here we slowly learn more and more about the characters until finally at the end WHAM! The big turnaround and a very nice payoff. Credit is due to both Kalogridis and for Lehane's magnificent story.Richardson, who is nominated this year for Inglourious Basterds, makes it clear that there isn't going to be a lot of sunshine both in the story and on the film. The very first frame we see a boat emerge from the fog as it rolls towards Shutter Island. Bringing with it Teddy, Chuck, and one heck of a storm. Scorsese and Richardson were obviously going for a stylized effect, carefully selecting the appropriate lighting for each scene, a crucial element to the film's success. Each shot is clear, crisp, and emphasizes just the right colors or lack of color.The performances were right on the money. DiCaprio has developed quite an on screen presence. When he is in the shot we focus right on him. He gives 110% for every scene. Seeing as his character has a lot of emotional baggage, he plays it very paranoid and jumpy, unlike his partner Chuck who is more relaxed and level. DiCaprio clashes with the authorities on the island so well like Kingsley, Max von Sydow, and John Carrol Lynch. Also a great cameo performance by Jackie Earle Haley as one of the patients. His career is certainly looking brighter with each performance.There are a few downers in the film. I thought the middle of the film was a little slow sometimes and lacked the pace and intensity of the first and last acts. The flashbacks for the most part were a little too artsy, almost to the point where it was literally pouring down on us. They felt a little out of place considering the rest of the film, but it felt okay in flashback/dream form. They were very well shot and had a particular look that I enjoy (artsy).What I love about Scorsese, like other great filmmakers, is that regardless the theme, setting, or genre, he manages to add his own personal touch. Though there is certainly a touch of Hitchcock, the angles, composition, and overall look of the film is Scorsese. He's a incredible filmmaker who continues to make hit after hit after hit.",8,2,6,28 February 2010
Capote," Turmoil in Kansas
","On November 15, 1959, a family of four were murdered in their Kansas home one evening by two reckless men with shotguns. Soon after, writer Truman Capote opened his newspaper to find the article pertaining to the tragic event. His life would never be the same.In Benett Miller's Capote, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Magnolia, 25th Hour) stars as the famous writer who went all the way out to Kansas to inquire about the events that took place. With his friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener, The 40 Year Old Virgin), who wrote a book called To Kill A Mockingbird, the two go throughout the town of Holcomb to find answers.The two suspects, Perry Smith (CLifton Collins Jr., Tigerland) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), are young boys who are dazed and confused by the whole situation. All Capote wants from them is the real story. In doing so, Capote seemingly is falling deeper and deeper into Smith's background and becoming quite fond of him.As Capote starts to write his novel he realizes his turmoil. If he finds out what really happened that night in the Kansas household, he could send the two men to the gallows. If he doesn't find out what happens, his book will never get published. His morals are really in question.The movie touches on Capote's homosexuality but actually says it. His lover Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood, I, Robot) also feels the hardship of Capote's novel. It is consuming his life.Hoffman has a difficult job to do in this movie. He has to sound, look, and act just like Truman Capote did. This is the easy part for Hoffman and his performance is stellar. But on top of becoming this character physically, he has to really get into Capote's head. The film shows Capote early on having a great time and 'living it up' after the success of his latest novel Breakfast at Tiffany's, which went on to become an Academy Award winning picture.As the movie progresses, you can see Capote start to become movie involved with the suspect Smith and having his book published. Smith's case is still winning more appeals higher up and a stay of execution. Capote's mood goes bad to worse. His novel isn't finished but is already gaining significant attention. The whole ordeal is eating him alive. Capote is a fantastic movie that showcases why Truman Capote never finished another book after his publication of In Cold Blood.

Tangled," Beautiful animation meets mediocre dialogue
","Tangled is Disney's take on the classic tale of Rapunzel. The story of a princess stolen away from her parents as a baby and locked away in a secret tower. She is kept there by a woman, Mother Gothel, imposing as her mother. Rapunzel is no ordinary girl however, for her hair holds the power to heal those who touch it, and more importantly for Mother Gothel, keep her looking younger. There is a catch: should her hair but cut, the spell would be broken. As we all know, Rapunzel has very, very long hair.Just days before her 18th birthday, Rapunzel yearns to leave the tower, because every year on her birthday there is a strange phenomenon that occurs in the sky; a mass of star like objects float up to the heavens. Rapunzel has dreamed her whole life to see in person where these stars come from. Her dreams are answered when Flynn Rider, a thief, stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower while making a getaway. Rapunzel hides his loot and will return it should Flynn show her where the stars come from.Though not true to the original story of Rapunzel by the Brothers Grimm, the story remains intact for the most part. This is true for the majority of fairy tales adapted by Disney, mainly to appease audiences and to entertain rather than frighten children, something all too common theme in Brothers Grimm fairy tales.That said, you can only go so far in changing a story. The problem with this film is how they start to step on the toes of other fairy tales and films made in the past (and even other studios). One scene that sticks out is between Flynn and Rapunzel in a small row boat in front of the castle. It's eerily similar to the 'Kiss the Girl' sequence from The Little Mermaid, even including Rapunzel's little friend Pascal, a tiny chameleon (Sebastian the crab anyone? At least Pascal doesn't sing). I also found some similarities to Dreamworks' Shrek, simply because we have a damsel in distress, rescued by an unlikely hero, and reluctantly guiding her back to a castle. Just a thought.Another aspect essential to a Disney 'princess' movie is the song selection, something The Princess and the Frog nailed last year, There aren't a lot of musical numbers, only four or five, and luckily they're not terrible. It's not their best work, but it's hard for composer Alan Menken to top his previous work, which brought him home eight Oscars (Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, etc.) It helps that Mandy Moore has the pipes to handle the work load, even though every time I looked at Rapunzel I saw Taylor Swift.What makes Rapunzel special is the animation. This is Disney' Animation Studio's fourth feature done completely with CGI, and their patience paid off. Chicken Little, Meet the Robinsons, and Bolt all had bright spots, but all fell short. Here they finally captured the most important ingredient to properly animating a CGI film: texture and lighting. If you watch the Pixar films, you can see how with each film they get better and better with texture and lighting. As the technology improves, so does the image. It also helps that they are getting more practice with the medium.The Disney artists were inspired by Jean-Honoré Fragonard's The Swing, a beautiful oil painting true to its Rococo style, an art movement that focused on ornate, free flowing designs. Much like Rapunzel's hair the artists on this film truly met the challenge of capturing the style of the painting, creating landscapes that were unique and alive. Rapunzel's tower, the forest leading up to the castle, and the town surrounding the castle itself exemplify this style.Though I enjoyed the look of the film, I wasn't a fan of seeing it in 3D. I found myself looking over the top of my 3D spectacles and see what the film would look like, and I feel like the images would be just fine without it. Though the panorama views look nice, it's not necessary to view them in the third dimension. I understand that the revenue from 3D films is a tremendous boost in box office numbers, but sometimes it's overkill. I felt the same way for Toy Story 3.I recommend this strongly for families. The kids will love it. Those looking for a deep, thought provoking animated film in the same vain as Pixar or foreign animation, look elsewhere. Unless you can tune your ear out periodically to embrace the images, enjoy. It's hard to say no to a Disney movie, but until they can consistently turn out hand drawn features, I must issue a warning. A slight one, but a warning nonetheless.",7,0,6,28 November 2010
The Aviator," Another Scorsese masterpiece!
","Martin Scorsese has been nominated five times for Best Director at the Academy Awards and not once received an Oscar. Raging Bull, The Last Temptation of Christ, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and most recently The Aviator. All of his films have been successes but he has never received credit where credit was due.In The Aviator, Scorsese depicts the millionaire Howard Hughes; a man who is intelligent, rich as hell, and obsessive compulsive. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the director/aviation expert who wants nothing more than to make more money doing what he loves, not what his father got rich off of. Howard wants to make movies...good movies and to design and fly his own airplanes. In his first film Hell's Angels, he had his own air force built to shoot the realistic dog fights and amazing camera shots. This blockbuster hit took a lot out of him, mentally and financially, but he got it all back.With the introduction of Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), he finds a person who is rich, famous, and just the person for someone like him. Cate does a phenomenal impersonation of Hepburn and rightly deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Everything seems to be going great for Hughes. He is becoming more of a celebrity and is having some difficulty handling it.After the success of Hell's Angels, Hughes buys up the majority shares of TWA Airlines. He wants some of his ideas to be made into reality. After breaking the world record of flying speed in an airplane, Howard is ambitious. His ideas for new aircraft and commercial aircraft that are immense are looked at by other rival airlines, such as Pan Am. Everything Howard does is scrutinized by everyone and he starts to crack.After wrecking his new plane and nearly killing himself, Howard must go on the long road to recovery. Howard was always cautious of germs due to his mother's teachings. His little black bar of soap he uses to wash his hands 'clean' is of the same nature of Dr. Mannette's work bench in A Tale of Two Cities. Whenever he uses it, he slowly slips back into a bad mental state. Dealing with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is not an easy thing for him. This movie is a brilliant biopic of a man once thought to be genius and insane at the same time. Howard Hughes is showcased as both in this movie. Scorsese shows how a man tormented in his mind deals with his problems while being in the public eye all the time. DiCaprio is absolutely mind blowing as the millionaire Hughes. His portrayal of the man won him an Oscar nomination. The movie took home five Oscars that night, only one in the major categories (Cate Blanchett).The look of the movie gives it a vintage look from the roaring 20's right up to the 40's. Scorsese directs a gem with The Aviator. It is visually stunning! Scorsese sure can tell a story. This movie is flying high above the rest.",8,1,5,11 July 2005
Léon: The Professional," 'You wanna be a cleaner? '
","Movies about hit men are usually full of a lot of action, not intense and dazzling but just shoot em' up and pull the trigger. There is usually a dark history or a past that catches up with them. Thankfully there are movies that make hit men films fun to watch. Thankfully there is Leon.Leon (Jean Reno) is a professional hit-man in New York City. He is the best in town and in such a big city, there is a lot of work for him. The opening job is phenomenal and really sets the tone for the movie. Reno is very intimidating as the skilled assassin. But how a man who never thinks twice about killing a man could show some tenderness? Well all he needed was little Matilda played by a teenage munchkin named Natalie Portman After her family is murdered due to drug reasons, she must take refuge in Leon's apartment or else she will be found and killed as well. Although she hated her family and thought that she would one day do the same to them, she is distraught over the death over her four year old brother who was young and innocent like herself. Now she wants to know how to get redemption and 'justice' for the slaying of her family.Her number one target is a man by the name of Stansfield (Gary Oldman), a man more vicious than Leon. He doesn't care who the barrel of his gun is pointed at just as long as it hits. With Matilda clinging to Leon day and night, he decides to give into her requests of becoming a 'cleaner' like him. Along with Leon's favorite plant that he calls his best friend, the two learn much from each other. Now we have a Karate Kid interaction with Leon teaching her what seems to be useless things, but in the end they all pay off.Leon is a phenomenal film that takes us on a joy ride through New York City with the best hit-man and his young apprentice. Portman's film debut is a foreshadowing of her career to follow. Her stellar performance is very appropriate for the movie. Her character has had to be tough and smart her whole life and she really opens up to the audience. Reno's character is a complex one and he plays it very well. His foreign dialect and lack thereof charisma create a person that is both likable and mysterious. Oldman's menacing ways make him a despicable character and very powerful. Although he is a lot like Leon there is one difference: heart.Leon is an incredible experience and a great movie to watch anytime. It has action, drama, and comedy. It's not a big blockbuster action film or a depressing drama or a laugh out loud riot. Leon is a key piece to any movie lover's collection. This movie isn't for everyone. Like Leon says, 'No women, no children...'",8,0,1,13 August 2005
Cold Mountain," Zellweger steals the show
","Some movies has great acting that make the movie. This is a perfect example. Without Renee Zellweger giving an Oscar winning performance, this movie would not have been enjoyable. Her portrayal of Ruby Thewes, the tough talking farm girl who doesn't take nothing' from nobody. It was this character that saved the movie.The movie focuses on the journey taken by Inman (Jude Law) on his way back from the Civil War to find his lover Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). On this journey he comes across some unsavory characters and has to tough it out to find his way back to Ada. Meanwhile, Ada must keep try and keep the farm with the help of Ruby. Ada doesn't know much about farming but since her father just passed away, she must make it or break it. Hiding two deserters from the war, one being Ruby's father, doesn't make things easier with the local law enforcement always keeping an eye out on the area for people hiding deserters.This movie isn't terrible, but it isn't unbelievable either. If it weren't for Zellweger's performance, the movie would not be even close to the caliber of greatness. It is a good watch with some thrills and entertaining portions. The journey that Inman embarks on isn't an easy one and does have its surprises. Overall Cold Mountain is worth a viewing but may not be the right choice to buy. This film isn't for everyone but for those who like great acting, this is the place.",7,3,6,21 July 2005
U-571," Direct Hit!
","World War II movies have pretty much become its own genre of film. With everything from beach landings, air battles, and naval skirmishes. Now we get a great look beneath the waves on board a submarine to see what happens when a top secret operation goes horribly wrong.U-571 is the true story of a crew of sailors who are assigned a secret mission: to find and obtain the secret German coding machine known only as the enigma. Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) leads his crew with the executive officer Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) and CPO Henry Klough (Harvey Kitel). Along for the ride are Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) and Maj. Matthew Coonan (David Keith) of the USMC. Along with the crew, they venture out into the Atlantic, disguised as a German U-boat (subamarine). When they surprise a vessel carrying the enigma, there celebration is short lived, those who stayed behind on the boat are blown away by a another German U-boat. Those that were on the boarding party are forced to go into the actual German U-boat they were attacking and use it against the aggressor. With the exception of one German prisoner, they are on there own now and must find a way to get back home or to an ally port. The only problem is they are in enemy infested waters.What this group must do is follow their new commander in Lt. Tyler and try and stay alive through depth charge attacks and other German encounters. Luckily some of the crew speak German so they get by. Through the madness that was World War II, this boat will become a part of history with the recovery of the enigma machine. If the German don't know that they have it, the US and other allies can intercept other German U-boat's signals and search and destroy. If the German's suspect something, they might change the code and make the operation entirely useless. Lt. Tyler has some big decisions coming up ahead.The growth of the crew is tremendous and shows a real change in the relationship between officers and their fellow sailors. When these men are faced with a daunting task, they must come together to solve it. McConaughey is marvelous as the Lt. thrown into the captains role. With his student/teacher relationship with Kitel, he learns how to think and lead and to have an solution for every problem that arises.The movie really does a good job of illustrating the strength of a crew in war fare. Submarine movies are dicey to make. It's a confined space and it can sometimes get repetitive. With a new problem arising every other minute, U-571 will keep you on the edge of your seat. It almost makes you feel like you're in the boat with them. U-571 will cruise right into your movie collection.",8,1,6,18 July 2005
"I, Robot"," I, Robot brings action and science fiction together with a BANG!
","Sometimes, big action movies released during the summer just don't seem to cut it these days. There have certainly been some big flops. I, Robot, however, doesn't apply here.I, Robot starring Will Smith as Del Spooner, a cop in the year 2035, is thrown into a delicate situation. He has been given the case for a scientist who worked at the US Robotics. He 'fell' through a glass window to his death. What makes this case so strange is that there was no motive and his company was about to embark on the biggest Robotic distribution sale ever. Spooner doesn't believe it was suicide after looking at the scientist's office to find one of the new robot models hidden away and almost frightened. He jumps out the window as well. Now Spooner has a new lead...Sonny.There are three laws of Robotics: robots cannot harm humans, they must follow any order as long as they do not conflict with law one, and they must defend themselves as long as not conflicting with law one or two. these three laws come into play when this robot is associated with the death of the scientist. Now there is a great story of how Spooner tries to bring down the company with the help of another scientist for US Robotics, Susan Calvin (Brigdet Moynahan). The two are now involved with quite the scandal and if the robot did commit this crime, then it would be the first time ever a robot has broken a law.For some reason, this movie just works. Smith is very good as the robot hating cop. His character goes through a lot and is a good action hero. The special effects are quite amazing. It was even nominated for Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards. This movie carries itself in a huge sea of action movies.What this film has that other action films don't is a great story and great effects that compliment it, not the other way around. In a not too distant future, this movie brings up a lot of ideas about control and have we gone to far? I, Robot is a winner.",7,1,2,9 July 2005
Duck Soup," Timeless
","The Marx Brothers just seem to have that quality of making you laugh ever five seconds. This movie is nothing different.What we have here is a laugh out loud comedy featuring the Marx Brothers at their finest. Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo star in this film about the fictitious country of Fredonia where Goucho or Rufus T. Firefly is president.This film has some hilarious lines and unforgettable scenes like Groucho and Harpo's mimicking scene...PRICELESS!!! And would it be a Marx Brothers movie if it didn't have music...I think not. There is the music number featuring the cast sing about 'Fredonia's gone to WAR!'. This film has it all...with the exception of sanity.Without question this is one of the funniest movies of all time. With lines like, 'I'll see my lawyer about this as soon as he graduates from law school.' and many others like it, you will be splitting your sides until the final frame. Movies like these don't come around everyday.",10,1,1,30 June 2005
Edward Scissorhands," Edward Scissorhands cuts into your heart
","Living a life unable to come into contact with people must be pretty hard. This is the situation for Edward Scissorhands who has...you guessed it, scissor's for hands. Johnny Depp plays this outcast in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. The story of how a man made man comes out of exile and tries to live in suburbia.Depp as the lovable yet intimidating Edward Scissorhands is triumphant. His character is someone who fears people but also puts fear into people. When Peg Boggs (Diane Weist) attempts to make a sale for the Avon makeup company she works for at the old mansion in her neighborhood, she stumbles upon frightened Edward. With kindness in her heart, she takes him in.In her home Edward meets the daughter Kim played by Winona Ryder. She is at first taken by surprise, unlike her brother who thinks he is an interesting specimen. The father is very accepting. The family realizes that Edward has a gift...cutting. He can erect huge lawn statues out of the bushes and also give the local females a new hairstyle. Edward is used over and over again until the father believes he should make a profit. The story goes off on the contrast between Edward and their society. With Kim's boyfriend played by Anthony Michael Hall always picking on him and forcing him to do things he shouldn't, Edward is thrown into awkward, sometimes frightening situations.This is one of Burton's greatest pieces of cinema and is one for the ages. With great writing, a story that really hits the heart, and a great cast, this movie does well. As Peg Boggs says, 'Blending is the secret!' One of the most interesting and imaginative plots out there, Edward Scissorhand's is a timeless treasure that might bring a tear to your eye.A man cut off from society in more ways than one is a story many can relate to. Not being able to make physical human contact is hard to do and Edward was just made this way so he can't help it. This struggle of his longing for people is one that is showcased beautifully. Burton's mind for great movie making is not wasted on this film. Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece.",10,1,1,5 July 2005
The White Ribbon," The eve of war
","The White Ribbon (Das Weisse Band) tells the story of a small German village and the strange occurrences that happened in the months leading up to World War I. The film begins with an accident involving the doctor. He falls off of his horse and is severely injured. This is the first of several strange and out of the ordinary incidents.There is tension building between the lower class and the upper class. The major conflict stemming from the death of a worker's wife. While the husband tries to look past it his son refuses. Other groups like the Baron's son and other children arise.The film is narrated by the school teacher, telling the story many years after the incidents occur. He lets us know that even he is not sure of what happened, and what he is telling us might not even be true, much like a story passed down should be set up. It's not a perfect retelling, but it is (hopefully) accurate. What a story it is.Each individual character has their own story. The school teacher, the Baron, his wife and son, the doctor,his daughter, the midwife, the preacher, his wife and children, the nanny, and the list goes on with several minor but important characters. Story lines intertwine and combine to construct a complicated web. It's very well written (Haneke penned the screenplay) and paced perfectly. There are several themes and conflicts that arise here. Marriage, faith, loss of innocence, death, abuse, just to name a few.Filmed in stark black and white by Christian Berger (who worked with Haneke on Cache and The Piano Teacher). This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful films I have seen in a long time. There are some hard issues and startling images, but the camera makes each shot look like a work of art. Choosing to film in black and white gives the film an older quality simply because black and white tends to be associated with older films. It also makes light and shadow vitally important in helping to tell the story. There are no colors to help determine emotions and feeling, just white, black, and in between grays. One mistake could render the image unusable. It's a pleasure to watch a film that pays such close attention to each shot.I was very pleased with the end. Throughout most of the film we are trying to figure why these horrible things are happening and in most cases who is doing them. Haneke keeps us guessing right through to the end. I'm not sure how others will fell but I felt very satisfied. I invested a lot of energy and emotion and continued feeling for the characters and thinking about the film long after it was over. That's my favorite part about great films. The ability to stay with you after the credits roll. Haneke succeeds.",10,1,5,25 April 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I come from the land of the ice and snow!
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is certainly one of the more depressing films of the year, but also one of the most enthralling, hard to turn away from films of the year. It follows Mikael Blomkvist (Craig), a journalist who has just lost everything, and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a researcher/computer hacker whose life has been nothing but hardship and misunderstanding since her adolescent years. The two converge on a case surrounding one of the more prominent and dirty families in all of Sweden, the Vangers.Henrik Vanger (Plummer) hires Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his niece. He encounters many problems, the biggest being the disappearance happened 40 years ago. When his research starts getting interesting and more dangerous, he calls upon Lisbeth, who did the background check on Mikael for the Vangers. Together the two try to solve the case, digging up hidden truths, dirty secrets, and encountering some detestable characters along the way. They don't know if they're getting close or farther from the truth, but as the heat turns up, it seems like the answer is rapidly approaching, or is it their impending demise?What stands out most about this film from the original Swedish version of a few years ago is the mood. Yes, both films cover some disturbing material, but the original version looks like it was filmed in the real world. Fincher, however, creates an entirely different world. It looks, feels, and almost smells dirty. There is hardly a white light found in the film. Even the snow is turned grey by the overcast skies. You get the feeling that there is no hope for these characters.There is really only one area where the film lacks. Pacing. There is so much information to translate to the audience. It's the job of the editor and the writer to make sure that the audience doesn't skip a beat. There is montage after montage, intercuts, and Swedish writing thrown about that it's hard to keep track of what exactly a character is doing. We get the gist of it all, but there were moments when I was lagging behind just enough to notice.Other than that I thought the film was a fine adaptation for American audiences. I wasn't sure how the sexual violence would be handled, but Fincher doesn't hold back, much like the Swedish film. Is it important that we see this violence? I hate to say it but yes. We need to like Lisbeth so much that we completely disregard her outward appearance and see her as a survivor. She's extremely talented and fearless. Mara brings Lisbeth to life much like Noomi Rapace brought her to life, only Mara is a letter more brazen and less moody than Noomi, but both are effective with what they do. Craig too gives a solid performance. I was worried that they would try to toughen his character up (seeing as Craig is currently James Bond), but they didn't. They make him likable only because he seems normal and one who stands up for what he believes in.It's a slimy, complex, fast-moving thriller that is sure to turn some heads at times but in the end you'll be holding your breath and hoping for the best. You might go into the movie clean, but you'll come out dirty.",9,3,13,21 December 2011
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," It was worth the wait...
","You can't walk down the street without seeing something that uses sex as advertising. Clothing, entertainment, and everything under the sun uses some form of sex to sell an product. For men it is hard not to notice and start thinking about it. But some guys live they're lives with not a care in the world. That's where Andy Stitzer comes in...In The 40 Year Old Virgin, Steve Carell play Andy, your average nice guy living alone with his action figures, comic books, video games, and his bicycle. He works at a local electronics store where his co-workers are primarily guys. When the guys invite him out for a game of poker, he is all in sort of speak. As the game goes on the topic of sex is brought up. With all this talk about sex and erotic adventures, Andy is a little uncomfortable trying to mask his secret. But eventually the beans are spilled...Andy is a virgin.So what's the big fuss over not having sex? It wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't surrounded by David, Jay, and Cal (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen) who are undeniably infatuated with making Andy into a man. They give him all sorts of helpful ideas like hitting on drunk girls, talking dirty, and getting a full body wax. Andy tries to do what they tell them, but his past sexual encounters have kinda left a scar that isn't easy to heal. His desire has burnt out in a way. He just needs a spark in the form of maybe Trish (Katherine Keener), a woman who runs her own store where she sells stuff on eBay for people. With Andy's situation brightening and his co-worker's love life dwindling the movie really kicks off.Judd Apatow has written some funny material like Heavyweights and the TV series Freaks and Geeks. But nothing compares to this one. Carell is perfect as the humble yet ready for anything Andy. His side slitting humor is fantastic. Rudd does a great job as a man recovering from a hard breakup...two and half years ago. Malco and Rogen both give their take on women and either way it's hilarious. These four men are without a doubt one of the funniest ensembles put together. They rag on each other and push everyone around, but it's just what guys do. Everyone has met at least one of these characters before at work, school, or just noticed one.The 40 Year Old Virgin will have you rolling in the isles and wiping tears of joy from your face within the first two minutes. This laugh out loud comedy is a little too old for young teens so the R rating is necessary. This one perfect for those who like Old School, Wedding Crashers, and all of those recent off the wall comedies. So go out and enjoy this movie. Andy might have waiting 40 years to 'get it on' but you shouldn't wait to see this film.",9,2,6,23 August 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," A story so unbelievable it has to be true
","It's tough to single out the lone factor led to The Men Who Stare at Goats being so hilarious. Was it George Clooney's impeccable comedic timing or the fact that Ewan McGregor played a Jedi in the Star Wars trilogy and was now reporting on how the US government trained soldiers to be just that? Whatever way you look at it, this is one heck of a funny movie.Based on the outrageously true story by Jon Ronson, filmmaker Grant Heslov in his feature film debut brings to life this story about Bob Wilton (McGregor), a young reporter who goes to Iraq during the Gulf War to try and find a story worth telling. He ends up stumbling upon an undercover US military operation known as the Army's First Earth Battalion. This special branch's sole purpose was to create a non-lethal form of fighting enemies using psychic and telepathic means to disarm, interpret, and engage during times of distress and war.The man who shows Wilton the ways of the psychic warrior is Lyn Cassady (Clooney), who tells Wilton that he has been reactivated and is currently on a top secret mission. The two embark on a journey through the desert, small towns, and through the mind.I have to say that without Clooney's performance I don't know if this movie would have made it. His facial expressions and his screen presence are so powerful and outrageous that no matter what he is doing, be it trying to burst a cloud with his mind or locating missing army personnel thousands of miles away. His character is so ridiculous that you just have to go with it.He is not alone though. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges play other members of the 'psychic soldier' unit, both offering their own unique brand of comedy. Along with McGregor's witty comebacks and comments, the group will keep you laughing from start to finish.The one thing the movie lacked was that spark that set it apart from other comedies. Yes the writing was above average and yes, the performances were just as good, but there was nothing that made me say, 'Wow.' The real winner here is the story and the writing and acting give it the spark to make it dance and sing.It's not the funniest movie I've seen, but it's one of the most interesting and intriguing stories that you can't get enough of. You'll laugh, you'll laugh some more, and you'll have a lot of questions to send to your state representative.",8,15,25,29 November 2009
The Machinist," This will leave you speechless
","Thrillers as of late have been rushed and not well made. Gothika, for instance, could have been great, but instead, it was a good idea that wasn't care for. Identity was great, but even that could have had more work done for it. What you need is a great story with a great screenplay=lay, a devoted cast, and a director with vision. This movie has it all.The Machinist (or El Maquinista) is a thriller about a man named Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), a factory worker who seems to be physically wasting away. His weight is getting lower and lower with each waking hour, and that is a lot since he hasn't had any sleep in over a year. His friend, a prostitute named Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), worries that he truly is wasting away and wants him to get better. Soon he meets a man named Ivan in the parking lot at work. Trevor didn't know they got a new guy, but he thought nothing of it. When Ivan distracts him from his work, an accident involving another worker occurs due to Trevor's focus on what Ivan was doing. Now begins the chase of whether or not what Trevor is seeing is real and how the past catches up with you awfully fast.Bale gives a performance that will resonate in my mind, that's for sure. Losing that much weight to play this role must have been grueling. His character is one that you like, pity, and don't understand. His sleeping habits, work ethic, and mental state are all at question. His 'lady of the night' friend Stevie is another character that is likable but one you pity and don't understand. Whether or not what Trevor is seeing is real makes this movie that much more entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The relationship between him and the waitress at the airport diner is one that is interesting. Why would he keep driving all the way out to the airport for a piece of pie and a cup of coffee when he could get one near his apartment. Either way, the story unfolds beautifully and is truly amazing. The whole story just blew my mind.It's hard to say much without giving away the ending but all you need to know in order to see this movie is that it will grab you until the very end. It's not a movie you can watch for a while and come back to. Sit tight because you are in for a great ride.",9,1,1,30 June 2005
Ratatouille," My compliments to the chef
","Fog settles along the bank of the Seine River in Paris. The street lights have an eerie, romantic aura about them. A young man scurries down the steps towards the river's edge from his bicycle, looking over his shoulder every which way to see if anyone is around. With him is Remy who will soon be at the bottom of the river. He approaches the edge, ready to dispose of the innocent victim. By the way, Remy is a rat.The latest Disney/Pixar collaboration Ratatouille brings us through the streets of Paris and into the kitchen of what was once a five star restaurant. This witty and wonderfully put together animated feature is just another astounding accomplishment by the creators and animators who brought us Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles.We find ourselves following Remy, a Parisian rat whose taste buds are not satisfied with the everyday apple core and pizza crusts. His unique ability to create delectable treats that even a human can't resist ends up having him separated from his friends and family, but brings him to the kitchen of one of the most respectable restaurants in all of Paris. After sneaking into the kitchen, Remy rescues a sauce that has been ruined by Linguini accidentally and has the customers in an uproar about how delicious it is. Remy, after being spotted, is taken out by Linguini who must dispose of him but can't after figuring out that Remy can understand him. Linguini realizes that this rat has made the soup and must come up with a way of recreating the soup and keeping Remy a secret.The two must join forces in winning over the chefs, the customers, and the critics in order to keep the restaurant in business and to keep Remy alive. Remy figures out a way of manipulating Linguini's movements to prepare the food and keeping himself out of sight.Since Toy Story's release in 1995, every film since then has been a step up in the advancements that have taken place in the production of these films. The quality of the animation and the attention to detail is unbelievable. Every shot and every movement is a carefully drawn out plan with many levels. There is the lighting, the action on screen, the movement of the camera, sounds, and a wide spectrum of minute things that we don't even notice but are essential in creating a scene.Take for instance the city itself. The film mainly takes place in the kitchen, where Remy's family lives, and where Linguini lives. All of the in between scenes that are only on screen for a few seconds give the film this grand scope. The Eifel Tower is a a prominent piece of the Paris skyline. But the lights and cars and trees that surround it give it much more depth.One thing that has made all of these films successful are the ingenious stories and their characters. The writing for all of these films has always been solid and in tune with the message that is trying to be sent with each story. The glue that holds the story together is certainly the characters. The cast of voices include Patton Oswalt, Brad Garrett, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehey, Peter O'Toole, and a host of amazing voice actors who bring to life these lovable and at times characters. Pixels become actors.Anyone can cook. That is the motto of the great chef Gusteau. But what this really means is anyone can do anything. Even if all of the odds are against you like a rat trying to be a five star chef, you can do it. The film is easy to understand but it works for all ages. There is something here that everyone can enjoy. That is why these films have worked for so long. They make an impact on all age groups.You don't have to be a food connoisseur to appreciate Ratatouille. Even if you have never had ratatouille in your life, this movie will go down smooth and easy, filling you up with satisfaction and delight.",9,1,3,12 July 2007
District 9," Harmony has a price
","District 9 is Neil Blomkamp's feature film debut as well as his writing debut. With the backing of Peter Jackson, whose films have grossed something in the billions, District 9 has a modest budget but tackles something more complex and unique. Something you don't need hundreds of millions of dollars in CG effects to show. We see a truly modern look at what could happen if aliens came to Earth and tried to live with us.The aliens live in a slummy refugee camp called District 9 in the South African city of Johannesburg. Their ship hovers overhead motionless since the first encounter back in the 80s. These creatures look like a cross between a cockroach and a crayfish. They are tall, rigid, and very cautious of the humans, often leading to violence.What is so unique about these creatures is not the way they look but how they act. Some are willing to comply with the humans, often engaging in activities with smugglers for food, weapons, and sometimes sexual intercourse. Both humans and the aliens understand each other's languages for the most part. It's refreshing to see a very foreign race of intelligent life interacting with humans in a non-hostile way, at least for some of the time.When tensions grow high, MNU comes in, an organization who is trying to relieve the tensions between humans and what they call the 'prawns' by evacuating them to a distant camp outside of the city. What ensues will ultimately change the course of history and future relations with the race.The film starts out with an almost entirely documentary style approach, using interviews as well as footage from in the district. We follow Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the man put in charge of handing out the evictions. Copley puts on a great performance as a man pushed to the limit and facing the greatest challenge of all: survival.Where the film differs from most as I stated earlier is the point of view we are given in regards to the aliens. They are hostile and dangerous, but for the most part they are terrified and in some cases defenseless. Are we supposed to support an alien race while our own is being shot up and killed? The way it is presented, yes, but only because of what we are shown in the film.There is also a heavy theme of race and equality, something that is all too familiar for this country and around the world. People of so called 'lesser' races and creeds are often lumped together in these grungy communities/camps, only to suffer greatly. These aliens are going through the exact same thing. It gives the film another touch of realism. This is not something that is so far-fetched for us to do.One thing I wish the film stuck with was the documentary style. I think it drifts too far from it after the first 20 or 30 minutes, but in order to tell the story I assume we have to. I think it could have been a little more seamless instead of being so abrupt. We literally jump from the cameras used by the characters in the film to the unseen cameras of the films production. It was unexpected.Had I not known this film was supposed to be amazing I probably would have liked it more out of sheer surprise. Still, I was very impressed with Blomkamp's story, camera work, and overall production. It's also nice to see a film shot in a place other than New York, Los Angeles, London, or something as recognizable. District 9 is a very intense, climactic, and unique viewing experience.",8,2,4,17 September 2009
Batman Begins," Batman is BACK!!!
","When it comes to Batman, the four movies prior to the release of Batman Begins have had different interpretations. Michael Keaton played a Batman that was great. He was smart, funny at times, and had the right voice, just didn't look the part. Then there was Val Kilmer who looked great at Batman and Bruce Wayne, but didn't have the voice. George Clooney was great for Bruce Wayne, but that was about it. Now, the next Dark Knight, Christian Bale, has hit a Grandslam.With his suave appearance, Bale seems to be right at home in Wayne Manor. His background is clouded by the death of his parents and he sets out on a journey to explore the mind of a criminal. Eventually, his calling is found in his fear...BATS. The soon to be caped crusader must help Gotham City overcome the most powerful of adversaries...fear itself. Thanks to Gotham's new villain Scarecrow, the streets of Gotham are flooded with fear, literally. It is time for Bruce Wayne to become who he was always meant to be, Batman.As Batman, Bale is dark, mysterious, intimidating, and everything else Batman was supposed to be. With a voice that would make a tiger cower in fear, Batman controls the crime wave and begins his mission to save Gotham from fear and soon to be total destruction. With the help of some old friends, his butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), and his supplier of 'gadets' Luscious Fox (Morgan Freeman), Bruce is ready to take on the night. The city of Gotham rests in his hands.Director Christopher Nolan of Memento fame delivers a stunning spectacle that showcases what Batman is supposed to be...Batman. Hopefully he won't stop with Batman and continue making the sequel or other movies of this splendor.Gotham's protector of the people is back and better than ever!",10,0,1,30 June 2005
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Merry Cruise-mas!
","Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a fun, exciting, and one of the coolest films of the year. It has guns, gadgets, explosions, sex appeal (for men and women), stunning locations, one of the best stunt performances by an actor of all time, and a finale that is so ludicrous it's hard to dislike.Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, IMF's top agent. After breaking out of a Russian prison, he and his team (Paula Patton and Simon Pegg) are sent into the Moscow Kremlin to search for nuclear launch codes. When their plans are botched by another party (codename: Cobalt), an explosion in the building points all fingers at the US. Hunt and his team are deemed terrorists, though the Secretary of State gives them some 'incentive' to continue their mission and find Cobalt before the launch codes are used.Hunt, Jane (Patton), Benji (Pegg), and newly acquired Brandt (Jeremy Renner) search the globe for Cobalt, intercepting messages, causing chaos, etc. There's a lot of running around (this is a Tom Cruise movie, right?) and a lot of jaw dropping stunts (honestly jaw dropping) to help keep you engaged. The climax of the film is so intense you will really start to believe that this mission is without a doubt impossible. Just when you think things will work out, the stakes get higher.I guess I forgot how impossible the missions really are. I was skeptical when they said 'nuclear launch codes,' at the beginning of the film. That might work for a cold war era James Bond movie, but this far off from that era makes it sound a little corny. After a while though I bought into it. The REAL winner of this film is the action.Nothing goes to waste. There isn't a punch, kick, or jump that is thrown in just because it looks cool. Every fight, every sprint, and every explosion happens for a reason. To aid the action is a fantastic effort by stunt choreographers, performers, and yes, Tom Cruise himself. After watching some behind the scenes featurettes, I can assure you that what you see is pretty unbelievable. I thought Tom was sorta crazy for a number of reasons, but this film puts him over the edge (only this time in a 'Oh my God did he just do that/that was totally awesome!' sort of crazy).The locations are fantastic, the action intense, and the drama over the top. I thought I was going to have a hard time buying into the impossibility of the mission, but I totally bought it. There were a few moments when I honestly thought, 'How are they going to get out of this?' You'll have to see it for yourself. It's outstanding. Quite possibly the most exciting film of the year other than Rango.",8,1,2,21 December 2011
Drive," Just drive.
","Calm, cool, collected. There are a ton of characters who fall under this description, but there are only a handful that stand out above the rest. Rick Blaine in Casablanca. Jef Costello in Le Samourai. Jack from The American. These characters are methodical. They don't lose control easily, but if they do you would never know.It's safe to say that the Driver from Drive can be added to that prestigious list.Drive is the cool, smart, festival favorite of the year helmed by Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Valhalla Rising, Pusher). Based on the book by the same name, Drive follows the Driver, played by Ryan Gosling in a tour de force. He's a nameless, mechanic who does a few jobs on the side. Sometimes he's a stunt driver for Hollywood movies. Other times he's a getaway driver. Regardless the setting he works with efficiency and composure.His handler Shannon, played by a fantastic Bryan Cranston, extorts his talents at the shop and with other jobs, but the driver doesn't mind. Shannon is a guy with the best of intentions just trying to get luck back on his side. His problem is associating with gangsters, played by Albert Brooks in a surprisingly nasty performance and Ron Perlman, his nasty partner in crime.The driver, with his tough exterior and cold stare, has one soft spot; his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio. Her husband is currently doing a stretch in prison and the driver takes it upon himself to keep her safe, even when things start to get really ugly.Drive is a samurai type story set in Los Angeles. The driver has morals that he stands by. He doesn't take advantage of people, he isn't concerned with material things, and if you wrong him you better run. Gosling plays the role with a certain grace rarely seen on the big screen. He speaks with his facial expressions. A glance, a twitch resembling a smile. When he does speak you listen. His words are selected carefully. No small talk, just enough to get his point across. He does the rest of the talking with his hands.The rest of the cast does an excellent job. Mulligan continues to shine as well as Breaking Bad's Cranston. Cranston especially had a certain quality about him. The way he carried himself made me feel like he knew exactly who he was playing and what he had been through. It was interesting seeing Brooks in a tough guy role, seeing as he seems to nab the slightly neurotic and always comical characters (Finding Nemo, The In-Laws, Defending Your Life), and Perlman continues his string of rugged performances.Refn's style carries over from his previous films, an impressive feat considering he's used three different cinematographers on his four major films. There's violence when there needs to be, there's an excellent musical selection, and there's fantastic camera work. The angles, the cutaways, all perfect. He manages his action scenes with extreme care. We get an excellent dose of action with character decision and reaction. He doesn't bog us down with a heavy musical score or a plethora of shaky cam cuts. We get nice, smooth shots, showing us the craft of the chase.This film is going to be a slow mover for some viewers. If you're looking for a high octane thrill ride, I would either prepare for a bit of a wait, or go see something else. There's a lot of waiting, but if you can handle the wait it is well worth it. It's more violent and more intense than The American, which might have been the most underrated movie last year, but it shares in that less is more quality.A big win for both Gosling's career and Refn. With his last string of movies Gosling has really stepped up his game. He's more than just a face. This role allowed him to look good and kick some ass, all without taking his shirt off, something a standard Hollywood action flick would require. Expect this film to maintain it's headway heading into award season. I'm basically guaranteeing at least Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor nods, with the possibility of supporting actor nods for Cranston and Brooks. Who knows, it could be a double nod year for Gosling who's co-starring with Clooney in Clooney's The Ides of March.",10,2,9,17 September 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," So you don't want to be a mutant...
","Who wouldn't want the ability to walk through walls or fly away into the sky? Who wouldn't want to be able to lift cars hundreds of feet into the air or turn a cloudy day into a gorgeous sunny afternoon? For some this is a dream come true. For others than can't function without destroying their natural way of life, it is a curse. The premise for the latest installment of the X-Men saga is just that.X-Men: The Last Stand goes deeper into the mutant versus human controversy. All of the favorites are back with the addition of some needed support. The main focus of this film is the introduction of a vaccine that can rid a mutant of its powers. It is called, 'The Cure'. Magneto, played once again by Ian McKellan, gathers his Brotherhood for a war on the mankind once more. His eyes are fixed on the one person who holds the answer, a small, innocent child with a gift so powerful, Magneto will risk everything for it.Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) upon hearing gathers his group of X-Men to stop the menacing Magneto. He is short a few of his troops from the last film. Cyclops is still lamenting over the loss of his dear Dr. Jean Grey. When he can't take it anymore, he drives out to where he last saw her. Her voice has driven him to the edge until she appears. Who he meets isn't Jean, but her true self; Phoenix. She is Jean's alter ego, the most powerful mutant Charles or Magneto ever encountered.Director Brett Ratner of Rush Hour fame delivers an action packed, special effects driven adventure. His style is unlike that of the previous X-Men films. His version is more along the lines of a regular action flick. A lot of explosions, stunts galore, and a so-so script. What made the other films enjoyable was the emphasis on the characters. This film has almost too many to include. Although some weren't present and some don't make it, there are too many side stories going on than are needed.The mutants are always a blast to watch. Hugh Jackman returns to his old guns, relying on witty remarks and vicious attacks on unsuspecting victims. Somehow it doesn't get old. Kelsey Grammar is introduced as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known as Beast, a blue skinned, blue haired genius who wants nothing more than this war to cease. Also introduced is Angel, who sadly doesn't play too much of a role. On the other side of the battle is Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones). A one man wrecking crew whose momentum is unstoppable to the strongest of obstructions. Beside him is Callisto, a speedy little devil whose impact is virtually just filler. There is more emphasis on characters like Kitty, the girl who can walk through walls, and Collossus, a metal strongman, and less emphasis on Rogue and Mystique.Without these characters in play, the film is special effects driven. Impressive CGI graphics and and intelligent use of the mutants powers go a long way in the making of this film. Characters like Storm (Halle Berry) rely solely on the effects provided by Ratner and his team or visual effects artists.As far as summer blockbusters go, this film isn't one to be trifled with. It presents a lot of aspects that a blockbuster should have: a lot of big name actors, reliable story lines, stunning effects, and most importantly, an appeal to a large audience. The movie might be a little bit mature for children, but comic book fans and fans of the films will thoroughly enjoy this. The only remaining question left is; will there be another?",7,198,367,26 May 2006
The Lives of Others," The Walls Have Ears
","You enter your room. Everything is fine and where it should be. Your coat is on the rack, your partner in the shower, and your cigarette still smoldering in the ashtray. Behind the walls and under light switches there are microphones and wires running into someone's headphones. You are not alone.Neither are the people of East Germany. In Das Leben der Anderen, we get to hear what goes on and who is doing the listening. Translated, The Lives of Others is exactly what it says: it's about the lives of others, someone's life other than yours.Throughout East Germany in the 70's and 80's, wiretaps and surveillances were placed amongst civilians considered to be a threat to the government. They would interrogate these targets until deemed necessary or when the information they wanted was acquired.Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is a member of the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany. He and his colleagues suspect a local writer Georg Dreyman of conspiring against the government. Georg and his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland, an actress in Georg's play, live together in harmony. Behind Georg's back, she has been seeing a high ranking government official to keep her name and her husbands 'hush-hush' so they may live peacefully. All is heard through Wiesler's headphones.After a 20 minutes sweep of the apartment, all areas of the home are covered. Wiesler's men work swift and efficiently. It is obvious that this is not something new but very routine. In 20 minutes they have managed to find all the necessary locations for their equipment to be placed, work correctly, and be unseen to the untrained eye. Wiesler finds a perfect place for his operations to be located: right above the cozy apartment.Everything is in place, the pieces aligned, and mikes turned on. Operation 'Lazlo' as it has been dubbed is ready to go. All they need is to hear one mention of treason and they storm the building and take them away. Easier said then done. Wiesler's friends get involved and so does Wiesler. One element wasn't accounted for in the briefing: compassion.There are several moments in the film where you feel bad for the people involved. Wiesler is spying on people who he comes to admire and wants to help them. In the opening of the movie, we see him teaching to a class explaining the proper technique to interrogating a person. His ruthless tactics and harshness towards his comrades make him seem almost inhuman. As the film progresses we see more of a compassionate and touched person than before.Georg and Christa have their own problems and to top it all off, their friends who have been black listed and spied on realize the danger that everyone is in. Their are eyes everywhere and no one knows where, except the only place that is considered a safe haven is Georg's place which ironically is the one being monitored.Technically it is very sound and very well put together. The editing is flawless, going from the attic with Wiesler listening to Georg's apartment and the actions going on inside. What really makes this fantastic story work is the acting. Brilliant performances from Ulrich Mühe (Wiesler), Sebastian Koch (Georg), and Martina Gedeck (Christa) boost the intensity and drama of the story to a new level. Another standout performance comes from Wiesler's friend, coworker, and overseer of the operation Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz played by Ulrich Tukur.The power and energy of The Lives of Others stems from the time period that it takes place in. The people are cautious and aware that they might have some unwanted visitors listening in. What is one to do when they can't leave the country but if they stay they are in danger?",9,5,8,25 March 2007
Hellboy," Hellboy...Hell No!
","Some movies just don't live up to the hype. Hellboy falls into this category. With a story line that is way out there, this movie really just doesn't work. Being a fan of comic book superheroes, I enjoy a plot that is at times...out there. But this was just too weird. The idea for Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) the character is kinda neat, but the other characters, especially the villain, aren't good.The character I speak of is none other than Grigori Rasputin, a man who is dead...but not. So he's sort of a zombie, but he has human qualities...like fighting. The man with no eye lids, lips, and a couple of other body parts missing, he hides behind a mask and body suit. After a couple of spins on the heart winder (his body is run by a special device that when turned...gets him going), he is ready to go. This is absolutely the most ridiculous character ever conceived.Hellboy must save the earth from the wrath of Rasputin. With the help of Ape Sapien (voice of David Hyde Pierce), an amphibious, intelligent, cross between a human and a frog/fish, and a girl who lights on fire named Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), these 'freaks' show up to save the planet from of course, total destruction.My advice is to stay as far away as possible from this picture. The sequel Hellboy 2, directed by the same director as Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro, hopefully won't be as bad, but will probably be like it's predecessor...bad. Hellboy should go back where he came from!",5,0,1,5 July 2005
The Incredibles," Not your ordinary CG-animated movie
","Animated movies are tricky to make. You have to write a great story that is compatible with animation. Then you need good animation. Lastly, you need the right kind of voice actors for your characters. As of late, the CG-animated movies have been flying into theaters and have been doing really well. This movie far above all the Shrek's, Ice Ages', and all of the other contenders. This movie is incredible.The Incredibles is Disney/Pixar's latest achievement in CG-animation. The story follows a family of real super heroes. Mr. Incredible or Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Elastigirl or Helen (Holly Hunter) have three children. There is Dash, Violet, and baby Jack-Jack. Jack-Jack is the only one without a super power at the moment. The others have some interesting talents to compensate. There is Mr. Incredible's astounding strength, Elastigirl's ability to stretch to mind boggling lengths, Dash's lightning quick speed, and Violet's cloaking ability and the power to create force fields. The problem with their powers is that they cannot use them due to a ban of all super powers back before the family was together. All super heroes were forced into retirement and kept secret with relocation and the government making sure they stay hidden. But all of this is about to change.When a menace in the jungle rises up, Mr. Incredible is contacted by a secret agency to remove the problem after being spotted on saving people with his buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson). Mr. Incredible's feels that this is just the jump-start for superheroes to make a comeback. What he doesn't know is that his past is about to catch up with him.This isn't just an ordinary CG-animated film. This film was nominated for four Oscars, winning two for Best Animated Film and Best Achievement in Sound Editing. It was also nominated for Best Achievement in Sound and even Best Original Screenplay which is quite an honor. Obviously, this means that not only was the animation great and technical aspects good, but the story was good enough to contend with live-action movies like Eternal Sunshine or the Spotless Mind (won Oscar for Best Original Screenplay), The Aviator, Hotel Rwanda, and Vera Drake. This movie was a contender with the 'big boys'. This is a huge step for animated movies of all kinds.Along with the story and the awards, there is a great cast of vocal actors. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible making him sound macho, tough, and also concerned about his family. Hunter is flawless as his wife who's worried that her family is slipping farther apart. Jackson is funny as Frozone and Jason Lee gives his voice to Syndrome and makes him quite convincing.The Incredibles is a must-see movie and should be in everybody's collection. This movie is above phenomenal and vent way beyond my expectations. Who expected this to top Finding Nemo? The Incredibles is an instant classic. Super hero movies will be around for a long time, but none will be like this.",9,2,4,28 July 2005
The Hurt Locker," Addicted to war
","The Hurt Locker is a brilliant examination of the war in Iraq, in particular a bomb squad unit faced with the task of replacing their bomb technician.Jeremy Renner is SSgt. Williams James, the replacement bomb specialist. He knows that the unit lost a valued member, but he makes it clear that he is no ordinary bomb diffuser. James is a renegade, adrenaline junkie set on doing the job his way. He has some regard for his unit members, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), but when it comes to him performing his job, he doesn't let them get in the way.The three members form a bomb unit that go around encountering all sorts of situations to suspicious automobiles to possible suicide bombers. James wears the bomb suit while Sanborn and Eldridge are his eyes and ears. They rely on each other to stay alive, whether they like it or not. Much like a chain, each link depends on the other to stay together.I have said this several times, but it is the originality of a story that makes me interested. War is a popular genre. For a movie to interest me, I need to be invested in the story, the characters, and the technical aspects. A good filmmaker focuses on one or two of these. A great one makes the package complete. Kathryn Bigelow, who before this film was probably more well known for being the ex-wife of James Cameron, has established herself as a very gifted filmmaker. In the opening scene she shows her ability to build suspense, releases it, and follow through with intensity, action, and fantastic camera work. Great tracking shots and impressive slow motion effects help make this a very memorable opening sequence.Bigelow wasn't the only person to impress me. Renner takes a big step in the right direction with this role. There is something about him that is so interesting. We know nothing about him other than he is the unit's new member. After seeing his renegade approach to the job, we assume he a nut job, someone who doesn't care about whether he lives or dies. As the story moves along we learn more about him and his family back home. He develops a friendly relationship with one of the kids that hangs around the base. Renner slowly peels back the layers of his character through little interactions with those around him. We see he is a true, blue collared soldier who wants nothing more than to serve his country.At the beginning of the movie we are given a quote that ends with, 'war is a drug.' Renner's character exemplifies this statement, being virtually the only person who wants to be where he is. It's a perfect way of setting the tone. A movie called The Hurt Locker is not going to be about sunshine and lollipops. It's going to be gritty and powerful. Bigelow presents some intense and moving images. This is a movie that stays with you. It's a movie that opens your eyes. That's exactly what a war movie should do.",10,53,81,18 January 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," It's a Wonderful Life
","Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.",10,583,832,21 December 2008
Transformers," Batteries not included
","Explosions, computer effects, guns, global annihilation. If a film has any or all of these parts it is most likely costly and will reel in a hefty load at the box office. But outside of the cinema gross and DVD sales, the film is most likely lost in the mix of the action-adventure genre. Sometimes, a film breaks out of the jumble and gets noticed.Michael Bay is known for big explosions, CGI effects throughout, big and nasty looking weaponry, and of course, the threat placed on our planet of total and complete destruction. After six films using and abusing all of these elements, it was time for a change. He found his answer in the unlikeliest of all places: A toy.Transformers have been a kid favorite. The ability to make a car or a helicopter 'transform' into a alien robot has dazzled the minds of youngsters for years. Now this concept, this world of alien robotics has made its way to the big screen in a big way in Bay Transformers.The battlefield is Earth and the humans are caught in the middle of an intergalactic war between the Autobots (good guys) and the Decepticons (bad guys). Each side is after the All Spark, a cube that contains the power to transform a machine into a fierce warrior robot. Megatron, leader of the Decepticons, wants to use this power to take over Earth and create the army that he needs. Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, wants to destroy the All Spark before it gets into the hands of Megatron.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the new owner of an old Camaro which just so happens to be Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. His plan was to impress Mikaela (Megan Fox) but ends of bringing her into this ordeal. Sam and Mikaela are dragged into the thick of things because Sam holds the key to finding the All Spark in his relative's belongings. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and the rest of the Autobots, vow to protect Sam and to find the All-Spark before it gets into the hands of the Megatron and his gang of Decepticons.The film right from the get-go starts off with a 'BANG!' and doesn't let go until the final frame. The action in this film is comparable to few films that I have seen. Transformers interact with the real environment and wreak havoc everywhere. Cars are tossed aside like used tissues and the ground is as soft as butter where this metal goliaths roam. Destruction is unavoidable with these guys around. Bay's blend of real-time explosions and effects mixed with the power and awe of the transformers is stunning to say the least.One thing that films of this caliber usually lack is weak acting due to a weaker script or just plain old bad acting. The cast seems to fit nicely in their roles and the dialogue isn't too unpleasant. Action films are full of clichés to begin with but Transformers has a nice balance of action, story, and comedy.From start to finish, Transformers just won't ease up. It is a joy ride that will leave you dumbfounded and simply amazed at what Bay and his team have created. This is more than an action film. Be careful, these toys could be hazardous...",8,2,6,4 July 2007
Children of Men," The essence of hope
","Thinking about the near future is not the best way to cheer yourself up nowadays, with depictions of social and political unrest, rampant drug use, and all of the other 'downers' that add up to paint a bleak and dreary picture. Suddenly out of the darkness comes hope.Based on the science fiction novel by P.D. James, acclaimed director Alfonso Cuarón brings to the screen Children of Men. The story of how one man, one teenager, and one miracle can potentially bring hope to a world that is filled with fear, struggle, and war.The year is 2027. The world has been struck with a terrible phenomenon. Women across the globe cannot procreate. To add to the chaos, the world's youngest living person has just died at the age of 18. Hope is a thing of the past and panic has replaced it.A man who had hope once, Theodore Faron (Clive Owen), has just been reunited with her ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) but some rather drastic circumstances. He is made aware of a group of people called the Human Project whose main goal is to help better the quality of life and to somehow find a way to continue the world's population. All he is asked to do is to gain access across the isle with a girl so she can reach the Human Project.Skeptical at first, he decides to go along with it after realizing what is afoot. The girl, Kee, is pregnant. The first child in over 18 years is about to be born and only a handful of people know about it. Theodore must travel past mounting obstacles, past all of the lies and deception, and try and help this girl and her soon to be born baby to reach her destination.A very original plot for a much abused genre of film and literature. Of course, there are some aspects that are not too original like the government watching over everything and the military battling terrorists. Perhaps the most startling aspect of the story is the time in which it is taking place. There are no hover cars, no space cities, and no hologram projections. Much like Steven Spielberg's Minority Report, the world is very similar to today.Cuarón's direction is powerful and oozing with emotion. At times, the camera is a character in the film. It moves amongst the characters as if a person were there along side, ready to jump in at any moment and contribute to the action going on. The shots are carefully constructed to show not just the main characters but also the devastation that is surrounding them.Color in the film is practically missing. Clothes, buildings, environment, and people seem to blend in to this dreary and godforsaken world. A lot of earth tones and dull colors fill the screen, with the exception of those objects that are meant to be happy or important, like Jasper's home, and blood.One aspect of today's world that is very important in the film is human emotion and the power of trust and friendship. The bonds that these people have to create to keep this girl alive show true human strength. Kee must trust Theo with her life and that of her unborn child. Theo has just met this girl but is willing to do what it takes to ensure that this baby is delivered into the world without harm, not just for Kee, or even himself. He must do this in the hope that the world will wake up and end this suffering.What Cuarón has created is a perfect balance of emotions with an above average story. Children of Men is the kind of movie that sticks with you long after you leave the theatre or turn off the TV. Its power is felt not just during the film, but after, and therein lies its beauty.",10,10,19,14 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," David and Goliath
","Senator Joseph McCarthy sought out to bring down communism in the United States in the 1940's and 50's. To rid our nation of people whose ideas could hurt our way of life and well being. The only problem was that anyone could be a communist, you just had to fit the criteria.In Good Night, and Good Luck, a team of journalists working for CBS News went on a mission to bring down Senator McCarthy. The driving force was broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow (David Strathrain, L.A. Confidential), who believed that what McCarthy was doing was completely unfair. Luckily he had a staff of journalists to back him up. The network reluctantly did so, too.The movie opens with an award ceremony in Murrow's honor. Because of his dedication to finding out the truth and his journalistic integrity, he was one of the first to stand up for what he thought was right and what was right for the American people. Then the movie goes back to when Murrow got involved with the McCarthy trials.Murrow gets involved when a man is accused of having communist ties. The evidence is concealed in an envelope that no one is allowed to see. A great scene is when Fred Friendly (George Clooney, Ocean's Eleven) is talking to the military about the contents of the envelope and who has seen what is inside. This conversation just adds fuel to the fire for Murrow the CBS News staff.In March of 1954, Murrow goes after the primary target, Senator McCarthy himself. He goes right for the throat. Using file footage and documents associated with McCarthy, Murrow comes out saying that McCarthy is a fake and shouldn't be doing what he is doing. It is a disgrace and telling McCarthy, 'We will not walk in fear, of one another'. Soon after McCarthy sends a message to Murrow saying that someone who is against what he is doing is probably a communist himself. The battle wages on between these two and the rest of the media world.This is Clooney's second attempt at directing. His debut was Confessions of a Dangerous Mind starring Sam Rockwell as the television game show producer Chuck Barris. Both films have very interesting and unique qualities. Good Night, and Good Luck was filmed entirely in black and white. This gave it a nostalgic look. The camera shots used were particularly exquisite, especially during the news broadcasts. You would see Strathrain speaking to the camera at an angle and off set you would see what the television camera was recording. It was a brilliant shot. Cinematographer Robert Elswit is no foreigner when it comes to shooting a picture. His prior works include all of P.T. Anderson's films and some other notables like Runaway Jury and Heist.The Acting was exceptionally good by everyone. Strathrain gives a lustrous performance as Murrow. Clooney as Friendly is at his best. Robert Downey Jr. (Wonder Boys), Patricia Clarkson (Pieces of April), Frank Langella (Dave), and Jeff Daniels (Pleasantville) all give great performances to compliment the others.Good Night, and Good Luck is a great picture that delves into a dark period of our history, the 'Red Scare'. The title of the movie is Murrow's sign off line, one of the best in television history. It is especially necessary for the time period he lived in. When the world was covered by darkness, he was the voice of security.",8,2,4,13 November 2005
Paranormal Activity," Scary is scared of this movie
","Before tonight, I can say that I have never seen a person run out of a movie screaming. After tonight, I can say I have.I think that sums up the feeling of Paranormal Activity. This film follows in the same style of film-making as Cloverfield and Quarantine using hand-held cameras by the actors themselves to give the audience the feeling that this is actually happening. To say that this film didn't scare me would be a lie. I wasn't the one running and screaming out of the theater, but I was among the vast majority of the audience who was on edge ready to jump at the fall of a hat.The film takes place in 2006 (it was probably filmed around this time because it was entered in some festivals in 2007). The main characters Micah and Katie live together in a nice home where for a while they have been experiencing strange occurrences in the night like footsteps, banging on the walls, and voices. Micah gets a video camera to document the situation. This is where we jump right in.Katie has been troubled by this since she was a little child. Apparently it has followed her back. It is quite evident that whatever has come into the house is not welcome. Every night Micah sets up the camera in the bedroom and records to see if he can catch the 'haunt' in the act.Little by little we see this happy couple become pestered, tormented, and pushed to the limit. Micah's camera is our only source of evidence (and the only camera filming) and we see it all. This film really does crawl under your skin. Micah and Katie act as realistic as possible given the circumstances they are presented with. The actors names are actually Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston. They are really the only people in the film with a few friends and the help of a psychic.This film succeeds mainly because of the mood filmmaker Oren Peli creates. We are given a nice back story for these characters and we feel for them. It's almost like watching a home movie. This realistic effect enhances the supernatural aspect of the story, making every bump in the night and strange occurrence that much more believable.Even with the low budget, guerrilla style film-making, the effects are excellent. There is no music in the film, one thing that most good horror films don't use. Silence is the ultimate suspense enhancer. If you can cut the sound, make your audience lean in a little, and then blow them away with a scare, you have won them over. There are several times where this is achieved either by showing something or not showing something. Anticipation and just the waiting for something to happen makes the scare element extremely potent.Some parts of the film lag a bit, but it only adds to the home movie aspect of the story. It can't be scary the entire time otherwise the suspense wouldn't be there. We are never sure where we are going to go. Every time we fade to the couple in bed we know that something is going to happen. We see the bed, the door, parts of the dark hallway, but other than that we are given very little and we have to wait and see what happens next.Writing about this film is giving me the chills. I would be lying if I said I haven't looked over my shoulder once or twice. This was a good old fashioned scare-a-thon with a lot of thrills and plenty of chills. I am very impressed with this first feature by Peli. Tremendous job and a complete success. He achieved exactly what he aimed for: to scare the pants off of people.",8,0,2,9 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Roald Dahl would be proud!
","Children's author Roald Dahl has written some of the most enjoyable and most memorable books of all time. Many of which have been made into motion pictures. Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, and currently in progress, under the direction of Wes Anderson, The Fantastic Mr. Fox. Probably one of his most famous stories is that of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This novel was made into Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory back in 1971. Now comes Tim Burton's attempt at recreating the classic story of how a poor little boy becomes one of the luckiest children in the whole world.In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton has his friend Johnny Depp to play the role of Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder in the original, a man of mystery and imagination who operates one of the most successful candy companies in the world. After many long years of seclusion, Wonka has decided to open his gates once more. He has put five golden tickets into five chocolate bars to be sent around the globe. The five lucky winners will be given a grand tour of the enormous factory. One of the five will be given a prize that is unbelievable. A boy that lives near the factory by the name of Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) wishes so much to find a golden ticket. He and his family can barely afford to put food on the table. They too want Charlie to win a trip to meet Mr. Wonka. When all but one of the tickets have been discovered, Charlie's chances are looking grim. By chance he finds money on the street and buys a Wonka chocolate bar. All out of luck and his previous two attempts looming over him, he opens the bar to find the last golden ticket!The next day is the day of the tour. There he meets the other four winners: the portly Augustus Gloop, the spoiled Veruca Salt, the must-win Violet Beauregarde, and the malicious Mike Teavee. These five all seem self absorbed compared to the humble Charlie Bucket. These five are taken on a whimsical journey into imagination, adventure, and of course...chocolate.What this movie has that its predecessor didn't was more comparison to the story. The movie doesn't focus on the outside world's craving for the golden tickets. It focuses mainly on Charlie's view from the bottom trying to scrape his way to the top. Their is more of an in depth look into the past of Wonka and how his life is impacted by his father (Christopher Lee). But what this movie lacks is a little sanity! Depp is at times a little too zany, and the Oompa Loompa's song and dances get out of control. Although they might seem childish, these parts to the movie are actually good. The compliment the crazy atmosphere of the factory. The songs are quite well done. The score of the movie and music to the songs is done by none other than Tim Burton's music man, Danny Elfman. A magnificent display of wacky music with a combination of heartwarming melodies.Tim Burton's wacky style is ever present and his over the top display of color and direction are a plus. His creative way of telling a story is what keeps him at the top directors around. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was much better than anticipated. It's just like a chocolate bar; it is sweet, gets better with every bite, and leaves you satisfied...",6,5,11,17 July 2005
The Insider," Crowe and Pacino are magnificent!
","Whenever someone hears about the big tobacco industries, they think big money and not to be meddled with. But in 1994, one man changed all that. One man stood up to this giants of industry and told them off. In 1999, director Michael Mann retold this story in grade A fashion.The Insider deals with the CBS 60 Minutes special involving the tobacco company Brown & Williams and their former researcher Dr. Jeff Wigand (Russell Crowe). 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) will go to great lengths to get this man to talk about his work with the company. What he has to get around is the confidentiality agreement that Wigand signed. Now that he has been fired for a bogus reason, he wants to get back at the company that now threatens his family. Bergman tries to bend the rules and go around every corner to get this man to testify in a court of law so that his testament will not be liable with the confidentiality agreement.With B&W watching every move that Wigand makes and checking everything that has happened to him from birth up to this point in time, Wigand is ready to do anything. Before he even appearers in court, he records an interview with 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). This interview may not go on the air at all if certain things aren't made right. What Bergman must do now is protect Wigand and still air this special without causing any trouble because he knows that this will be the biggest case in US history.Crowe and Pacino both give breathtaking performances. Crowe was nominated for his portrayal of Wigand and was well deserved. Wigand is an interesting character. He has to make the right choices without hurting his reputation, his family, and without breaking the deal with his former company. The decisions he makes are both life changing and have an impact on those around him. Pacino as Bergman is the perfect fit. He is an explosive actor and very passionate with his work. His work in this movie is incredible. He combines a soft heart with a hard-nose attitude that gives him a very powerful presence. These two men are great and even Plummer as Wallace gives a great performance. His character is both working for the people so they are informed, and working for CBS, making sure they don't go under with this story. All together, there is a great cast with smaller parts even shinning, especially Bruce McGill as Ron Motley, one of the lawyers working with Wigand.The Insider is a must see. This political thriller is a great watch and showcases two of today's top actors doing what they do best. Director Michael Mann is no stranger when it comes to good movies. His hits like The Last of the Mohicans(1992), Heat (1995), Ali(2001), and most recently Collateral(2004). The Insider is one of his best films to date. The Insider is a great film...and that's the truth.",9,1,2,30 July 2005
Annie Hall," Celluloid Memories
","Whether a relationship is good or bad it is almost impossible to forget. There are those that leave lasting impressions and those that hardly scratch the surface, but all leave something behind. There are memories of the good times, memories of the bad times, memories of the times you wished you did something different, and memories of the things you want to take back. If only there was a way to revisit the past.Woody Allen uses the best tool available: film. Through film, Allen shows us what happened prior, during, and after his relationship with Annie Hall in the film of the same name that turned Allen into a real film maker. Allen wrote, directed, and starred in this odd romance. Allen and Diane Keaton star as Alvy and Annie, a couple living in New York City. Alvy is a fairly well known comedian and Keaton is a singer. This isn't a linear storyline by any means. The film begins with the end and Alvy saying what is going on and how he got there. From there it is a glimpse at his childhood and the events leading up to his relationship with Annie.Allen's witty, neurotic sense of humor makes the smallest of difficulties seem monumental. Cooking lobster or trying to have sex becomes of war of words with the wise cracking Alvy. Unlike a normal storyline, this is all a flashback. Allen is telling the story as a narrator, but not in the usual way of narrating. In the midst of a scene Allen will pull away from the film and talk to the audience, as do other characters on the street.Allen's performance is superb. Keaton, who received an Academy Award for her role, is a free spirited, strong willed companion for Allen. Coupled with Allen's knack for writing, the two comic giants feed off of each other's energy to present a wonderful, dynamic couple. No clichÃ© conversations, no unnecessary scenes, just what is needed to tell this modern love story. Allen stays away from the standard formula of making a romantic comedy, instead breaking the mold for the genre.Annie Hall works on many levels. Its unique presentation of the story, the Academy Award Winning screenplay, its timeless characters, and of course, Woody Allen, for whom this film wouldn't be possible. Without Allen's inspiration, Annie Hall would have fallen in line with all the other love story's and become just another title in the sea that is cinema.Winner of four Academy Awards (actress, screenplay, director, picture), Annie Hall has made it's mark on the art of film making. It continues to be hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, including this critic. Allen has directed over 40 pictures, all with there own unique style and flare. Annie Hall, without a doubt, is the film that will be remembered. It gave the world something to laugh at and understand.",10,0,1,28 July 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," 2001: A Cinematic Triumph
","Great movies always have great quotes. Gone With the Wind has, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn', Casablanca has, 'Here's looking at you kid...', and The Godfather had, 'I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse...'. All of these lines show emotion and give the movie it's tempo. Yet one of the most famous lines of all time comes from a movie that has very little dialogue. 'Open the pod bay doors, HAL...' This is the line from 2001: A Space Odyssey that made AFI's 100 years...100 Movie Quotes list, enshrining all of those lines we keep saying long after watching the movie.In Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick takes us on an incredible voyage from the dawn of man to space age. We see how man has evolved and keeps evolving. The movie starts out with an overture and then we enter a barren landscape. The only life appears to be a few boars and the creatures in focus...the apes. When a black monolith appears in the middle of their clan, they begin to evolve ever so slightly just by discovering the first weapon...the club. From here Kubrick zooms us to Earth's orbit.Here we meet up with Dr. Heywood Floyd, a man who's mission is to see what is going on at the lunar. What they discover is another black monolith like the one the apes came into contact with. Figuring out that it came from Jupiter, we now climb aboard the vessel heading their with Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole. Also on the ship are more scientists and explorers. They are in hibernation, being kept alive by the on board computer, HAL 9000. HAL is everything a ship needs. It guides the crew, helps them, talks with them, and even connects with them. It can conduct interviews and just about anything a ship and its crew needs. The HAL 9000 series is a foolproof machine that seems to be the perfect unit for the job. The only problem might be that it is too smart and can actually...feel. When a piece of equipment malfunctions due to unknown causes, Dave and Frank question HAL's method for solving the problem. They feel as if it is working against them and the mission. It seems that HAL knows something that they don't. This is the start of a whole different problem for Dave and Frank.This film is a standout in a genre that is full of gems. 2001: A Space Odyssey shows incredible achievements in Special Effects, winning and Oscar for Best Effects in 1969. The quality I most admire of the film is how real it appears to be. The flow of dialogue, of which there is very little of, sounds like something you'd hear if you worked on a space station. It sounds at times like everyday life. The cinematography is fantastic. Much like all Kubrick films it has the Stanley Kubrick quality in the way it is presented. It is very original and fresh.Kubrick's direction is so well crafted. This is by far one of his best pieces of work. He has 9 movies on IMDb's Top 250 list which is more than half of all the films he has made. 2001: A Space Odyssey will open your eyes in a way you can't explain. Kubrick's camera direction, musical selection, and overall timing of the movie is perfect. It's a movie light-years ahead of it's time.",10,0,2,20 August 2005
Singin' in the Rain," Hollywood Melody
","A man and a woman stand at the top of a stoop in the pouring rain. After they kiss and embrace, the man walks down the stairs and waves off his driver. The stage is now set for one of the most legendary sequences in cinema history.MGM's Singin' in the Rain (1952) has dazzled audiences for over 50 years. It's a movie about singing, dancing, and movie making. Gene Kelly (An American in Paris) stars as Don Lockwood, a silent film star who along with everyone else in the movie making industry is trying to make the transition from silent's to talkies in the 1920's. He is part of the duo Lockwood & Lamont, the other half being Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). The unseen member of the threesome is Don's right-hand man and best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor, Francis). One night after a successful premier of the latest Lockwood & Lamont feature, Don finds himself in trouble with hardcore fans and jumps into a passing car. The driver, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, The Unsinkable Molly Brown), is startled to find out that it is Don Lockwood, and continues to hurl a barrage of insults to his profession, 'If you've seen one, you've seen the all,'. Later that night at the after party, Don finds Kathy is one of the dancers who ends up getting herself into quite a mess with Lina.When the movie The Jazz Singer, the first full length talkie, debuts it's a smash hit. All the studios must make the change to compete. This brings production to a halt and the need for a new screenplay. Their current work in progress The Dueling Cavalier is a travesty and needs to be revamped. The only problem is Lina can't sing, dance, or act 'the triple threat'. Now they must find a way to make a winning picture.Directed by Kelly and Stanley Donen, Singin' in the Rain only received two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Jean Hagen) and Best Score. This movie was ranked 10th all time on AFI's 100 Greatest Movie list. How could it only receive two nominations and no wins? Most likely it was due An American in Paris, released one year prior to Singin' in the Rain by MGM, winning a total of six Oscars and eight nominations.Today's cinema has changed dramatically since Singin' in the Rain. Movies have incredible special effects, the cost has gone up considerably, and the values have changed. Kelly worked like a dog to make this movie all it could be and he did that and more. The movie is filled with color and sound using a well crafted style.One of the most intense sequences in the film is the 'Make em' Laugh' number performed by the incomparable O'Connor. He showcases his dancing abilities and acrobatic stunts. The scene involves Cosmo trying to cheer up Don. The only way he knows how is to make him laugh. The scene was so tiring that after filming O'Connor was in bed for three days straight. Reynolds also endured a lot on set trying to keep up with Kelly and O'Connor.To truly become a masterpiece a film has to have survived through many years and Singin' in the Rain has done just that. It's truly a work of art that will be cherished for years to come.",10,1,3,21 December 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Nothing short of perfect...
","Have you ever wondered what it feels like to forget everything? It seems like it would be weird, not remember what you know. Like a favorite movie that you bought and watched over and over again. What if all that was gone when you woke up? What if someone has you erased from their mind completely without you being aware? In Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jim Carey plays Joel Barish, an average Joe trying to survive. When Joel finds out that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him and all the times they spent together erased completely from her mind by a doctor who specializes in the field, Joel gets very upset and has the exact same thing done to her. Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and his three employees, Mary, Stan, and Patrick (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah Wood) go to work on Joel's memories. Howard is the man in charge, Mary is the secretary, Stan is Howard's assistant, and Patrick is sort of Stan's assistant and gets himself into quite the pickle when he decides to date Clementine using Joel's memories as a guide to her. Now the process of erasing Clementine begins.Once inside Joel's memories we discover how this whole mind erasing duel started. Joel went to see Clementine at work and she didn't recognize him whatsoever, but she certainly was familiar with the boy at the store, whom she kisses, and remains anonymous. The thing with memories is it is hard to see things from a different point of view. The mood is the same, the emotions are the same, and the situation is the same. When Joel realizes that he doesn't want to forget her, he tries to hide her in different memories. Anything from childhood to random embarrassing memories. Stan and Mary don't know what to do...except smoke pot and fool around in Joel's apartment. When they lose Joel in Joel's mind, meaning that Joel has hidden Clementine in a different memory and his subconscious is doing the hiding, they call Howard over to take a look. What follows is a cat and mouse game in Joel's head all the while realizes what a great person Clementine is and how he wishes he con't forget her.Michel Gondry's vision is one that boggles the mind. This is one of the most original ideas made into a film in a long, long time. Along with the help of writer Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), this story of how love can exist between two people on opposite ends of the spectrum harmoniously. Carey is great as the subtle yet obnoxious Joel and gives the character a great boost of comedy. Winslet received an Oscar-nomination for Best Actress for her portrayal of Clementine, the exuberant, spunky woman of Joel's dreams. She makes him feel excited and adventurous and just plain good. Her performance is stellar.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is an instant classic. It's a league all on it's own. It has comedy, drama, romance, and a science fiction background. Gondry delivers the goods with this movie and I anticipate his future releases. Eternal Sunshine is a must own movie that any collector would be sad to miss out on. You can watch it 30 times and still find something new to appreciate every time. It will blow your mind...",10,2,5,21 August 2005
Alice in Wonderland," Alice in Blunderland
","Alice in Wonderland is one of several adaptations based on Lewis Carroll's books about a girl who wanders into Wonderland, a place filled with strange, comical fellows and some nightmarish creatures. We find Alice (Mia Wasikowska) on the brink of engagement to a man she does not like. Instead of facing her fears, she runs away. She comes across a hole, almost like a rabbit hole. She falls in and is thrust into the twisted world of Tim Burton, I mean Wonderland, or as the inhabitants call it, Underland.She is confronted by several characters, including Tweedledee, Tweedledum, the White Rabbit, the Dodo bird, and the Blue Caterpillar. They are excited because they believe that she is the same Alice who had been in Wonderland before and has returned to slay the Jabberwocky. Alice doesn't remember being there before except in her dreams. In fact, she continues to believe that she is still dreaming. Things get real for her when the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) sends out her minions to find Alice. She seeks help from the Cheshire Cat, who leads her to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp).Without going too far into the story, Alice is faced with several challenges dealing with her belief in Wonderland and her role in restoring order to the land. The Red Queen has brought bloodshed and tears to the once harmonious land. Her sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) willfully waits in the wings until her champion (hopefully Alice) will take on the Jabberwocky.Wow. That was a mouthful. And you know what, I don't really mind the story. Much like the Disney animated classic, the story is so bizarre, outlandish, and colorful that I can handle almost anything as far as bizarreness and an over the top story. What I don't like is bad film-making and storytelling. That is where the film goes horribly awry.Starting with the character of Alice, I never felt like she really cared enough. Yes, she is proper and holds a sense of dignity, but at the beginning of the film she seems so headstrong and opinionated. She never questions what happens to her, only saying here and there that it is all a dream. What bothers me even more is how much she says she cares about others like the Mad Hatter, whom she barely knows! I don't understand.The look of the film might be my least favorite aspect. A filmmaker like Terry Gilliam can get away with a film like this. Take for instance The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. It has a lot of special effects and green screen work, but there are actual sets and tangible things, as well as bizarre creatures and settings. Burton goes almost completely green screen with the exception of a couple of the actors. It's very fake looking and very forced. Things that should be somewhat natural are distorted. Yes, I understand that Wonderland is a very strange place, but that doesn't mean that a horse has to be CGI. Horses can be used in movies.The colors in the film were too saturated and gloomy looking. The animated version and other remakes include vibrant colors as well as dark, and gloomy ones. Here we see very dark blues, bloody reds, and jungle greens. A lot of overcast skies and grey looking sets. The real world looks more vibrant than Wonderland.The acting too was a bit off as well. Depp's character is supposed to be crazy, but I think he goes a little too far with the accents. I liked his enthusiasm, but was not completely sold. The White Queen was a confusing character. She was almost floating around, holding her arms above her hips like a fairy. I was never sure what to make of her. She seemed so fake. As I mentioned before I thought that Mia as Alice was a bit boring. Her face did not have much emotion, though she looked perfect for the part. I wanted more out of her.Had I watched this film in standard 2D I would have probably given it a much worse review. The 3D visuals do help make the film look better, but it should make it look amazing. The colors popped a slightly, but were I to watch it in 2D the foreground and background would almost certainly blend together, creating a very flat and uninteresting surface.I didn't have high hopes for this film and still I was disappointed. I wanted more from the actors (though the voice acting was pretty good, especially Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat) and I was hoping for a more pleasant looking Wonderland. A word of warning for those planning on taking young ones to the film: the PG rating is very lenient. There is a lot of disturbing and frightening imagery that could upset children. There is some eye plucking, head rolling, and some scary looking creatures. It could be too much to handle. I'm sure Disney pushed hard for the friendlier rating, but don't be fooled.",4,12,21,27 March 2010
Avatar," The dawn of a new era in entertainment
","Avatar is James Cameron's science fiction epic that has broken the mold for movie making. For years we have been hearing great things about the progress and set backs for this film. Since 1997, Cameron has yet to release a feature length film, excluding some of his work with IMAX and his documentary/3D films like Ghosts of the Abyss. 12 years after he broke all of the box office records with Titanic, the most successful film of all time, Cameron has come back with a bang. A big bang. Possibly the biggest bang in cinema history.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic Marine, is sent to a distant planet to follow up in his brothers footsteps. The planet is Pandora. A world filled with strange, magnificent fauna and flora. It's a world filled with vibrant colors, breathtaking landscapes, and a tribe of intelligent life called the Na'vi. Underneath their village lies a rich deposit of a very rare and profitable metal. In order to avoid a hostile takeover, the military has permitted Dr. Grave Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her Avatar program to try and persuade the locals through education, compromise, and good will that they are not to be feared. The program takes the DNA from the Navi and humans and combines them to create Avatars. These Avatars allow those whose DNA is in the Avatar to plug in andDr. Augustine's science department is at wits end with Colonel Miles Quatrich (Stephen Lang) and Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), the forces driving the drilling and military presence. They share one thing in common; an interest in Jake Sully. Sully and has his hands in both pots. He is the only person who can operate his brother's Avatar and he has an obligation to serve his military superiors. Sully is put in the difficult situation of making contact with the Na'vi and giving information to both Dr. Augustine and to Colonel Quatrich.I don't want to go into too much detail about the plot and the characters. That was the one part of the movie I wasn't too excited about at the onset of the film, but as the story played out, I became more and more involved and grew to accept and understand the story. It sounds and looks almost too ridiculous, but trust me, it works.I have seen a lot of science fiction movies. I have seen a lot of 3D movies. Never before have I seen a movie like this before. The clarity in the depth of vision Cameron creates is astounding. A friend of mine compared it to looking through a window, rather than the movie popping out of the screen towards you. I couldn't agree more. Needless to say, Cameron waited just the right amount of time to make this one.What make the visuals so outstanding is the attention to detail on each individual effect. Everything from the mountains and tree tops in the background all the way through the foreground is so clear and detailed. It's astounding! From the very first moments of the film when Sully is lying down and water droplets surround him, every scene has something to wow the audience.The cast has a wide variety of actors, the biggest of which is Weaver. I expected a solid performance from her but I was surprised by Worthington, whose only screen credit I had seen prior to this was Terminator: Salvation. Lang and Ribisi too give excellent performances. Even Michelle Rodriguez does a fine job. The actors that we can't see, like Zoe Saldana and Wes Studi, do a fine job as some of the the Na'vi leads.I felt a certain enjoyment that I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was like watching Batman or Jurassic Park again for the first time. A kind of thrill that you experience on a roller coaster. There is so much to fall in love with here. I would have no problem saying that this is the best movie of the year. It's almost in a class of it's own. Avatar is the dawn of a new age in cinema. Where we are not bound by the constraints of technology. It's proof that if you can dream it, you can do it. James Cameron sought out to create a mesmerizing, groundbreaking film and he accomplished just that and more. The doubters who thought he would fall on his face are now the ones picking themselves off of the ground.The future looks bright for big budget movies. With this new technology and new way of story telling, audiences can expect more high quality entertainment. James Cameron goes all in with each movie he makes. His next movie is called Battle Angel, another futuristic tale about a female cyborg rescued by a scientist. Sounds crazy. I can't wait.",10,22,34,8 January 2010
Up," Pixar soars to new heights
","Up is everything you could ask for in a animation film and more. This is Disney/Pixar's first film in 3D. I have been a bit wary about the use of this technology, but I can't deny that it looks breathtaking here. There are no cheap effects and it is only used to make the film look better, giving it more depth and character. It's not just eye candy and it doesn't take away from the story.The story follows Carl Frederickson, an elderly man who has had a dream for most of his life to fly to South America to see Paradise Falls, the place where his favorite explorer, Charles Muntz, last visited. When life pushes him to the limit, he decides to take matters into his own hands. Being a Balloon salesman, he transforms his house into an air ship, tying on hundreds if not thousands of balloons to life him above the landscape and off to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately for him but fortunately for us, he has a tag along. Russell is a young Wilderness Explorer (like a Boy Scout) who happens upon his house just as he lifts off. The two are stuck together until they reach the falls.Along the way we encounter a strange bird of paradise Russell calls Kevin as well as a dog named Dug who has a collar that allows him to talk. All distractions and annoyances for Carl but friends to Russell.This is a wonderful story that makes you truly happy when it's all over. I thought WALL-E had some deep and profound messages like staying 'green' and the dangers of obesity, but Up talks about fertility, life and death, companionship, fatherhood, as well as the generic loyalty, the importance of friendship, and having fun.Like all Pixar films (especially lately), there is always one aspect of the animation that is constantly being tested and glorified. In Finding Nemo we see how the water effects the objects in it as well as the light. Ratatouille showed how fog and shadows can create mood. Monster's Inc. focused a lot of attention on texture and interacting with the environment (like Sully's fur). In Up we get a lot of depth perception and panoramic views thanks to the 3D technology. There are times when I caught myself practically drooling over how beautiful a shot was. They really do a fantastic job in animating.Another big aspect of the production that has great importance is the voice acting. I think Ellen DeGeneres's voice acting for Dory in Finding Nemo is one of the greatest on screen performances of all time. The voices in Up capture the feelings of the characters perfect. Ed Asner voices Carl. He is grumpy, determined, but there is a lot going on under the surface that slowly rises up as the film progresses. Jordan Nagai voices Russell and gives exactly what we could possibly ask from a child actor: to be himself. Even the co-director and writer Bob Peterson does a great job as the voice of the dog Dug (also the voice of Mr. Ray in Finding Nemo). Other talents like Christopher Plummer, Delroy Lindo, and John Ratzenberger, the only actor to have an appearance in all 10 of the Disney/Pixar feature films.Like most Pixar films, so much relies on the music. My least favorite of the 10 films is Cars, a film that have a heavy modern soundtrack. I like it when they stick to their creative guns and fire off something new and fantastic. They were much better about it with WALL-E, mixing in original with with existing tunes like the Hello, Dolly! soundtrack. A very nice touch. Here with Up we have a brand new score that is inspirational and fitting to the story. There is a sort of waltz like we are floating across a dance floor. It fits quite nicely.Where Up falters is...nowhere. I have seen the film twice already and both times I left completely satisfied. The animation is some of their best and the story is tight and perfect. It stays the course and carries you the entire way. It's beautiful, poetic, and uplifting. Expect to be dazzled and wowed by this one.",10,2,6,5 June 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Two Guns Up!
","A director's first feature length film can make or break their career. If the film is successful and looked at as a nice first piece, the director must keep it going and make an even better picture. But the real test is the first picture's appeal to audiences. It can't be dull, boring, and have a bad ending. It has to be great all the way through to the last frame. One director created a whole new type of movie...a Quentin Tarantino film...In Quentin Tarantino's film debut Reservoir Dogs, we follow a group of men who attempt to steal a shipment of diamonds. Joe (Lawrence Tierney), the organizer of the group, has hand selected each of the six men who will perform the robbery. Each is given an alias except for Joe and his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) to hide identities in case of someone getting caught and to cover up tracks. There is Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), and much to his dismay there is Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi).The job appears to be simple, get in, get out, and get paid. There are eight men total and not a single one of them could ever expected what would happen. After a nice opening in a small diner and what would become the 'Reservoir Dogs March', we cut to Mr. White and Mr. Orange driving away really fast to the ware house where they would all meet. Mr. Orange has been 'tagged' in the gut and is bleeding quite a bit. Mr. White has given him his real name, Larry, to comfort him. When Mr. Pink arrives shortly after them, he gives his side of the robbery gone wrong. They both agree that there is definitely a snitch in the group. During the heist, the police appeared out of nowhere almost anticipating what would play out. Mr. Blonde in a state of panic/craziness decided to start shooting innocent people, fearing someone triggered the alarm. When the dust settled, cops were dead, civilians were dead, Mr. Orange was shot, Mr. Brown was shot in the head and believed dead, Mr. Blue was MIA, Mr. Pink and Mr. White are trying to solve everything, and Mr. Blonde has a surprise for them...a cop in a trunk. The movie takes an interesting turn as Mr. Blonde's sanity is in question and the cop is 'interrogated'.Tarantino's unique style shines with his camera angles, music selections, and of course...his dialogue. Tarantino's writing is phenomenal and incredibly brilliant. As soon as the movie starts he thrusts us into the middle of the eight men having a conversation of breakfast. The conversation being Madonna's hit single 'Like a Virgin'. The meaning of the song and how it was derived is brought up. Not your average movie talk, but it's just like real life. The flow and the reactions from everyone make it very real. This is by far Tarantino's strong point. He takes a great story and writes an incredible screenplay. The cast is phenomenal fulfilling their roles as tough guys out to do another 'job'. Keitel is the tough talking, heart of gold bad-ass who will help you off the ground and shoot the guy in front of him at the same time. It's as if his conscience takes a break every now and then. Buscemi and Madsen earn respect for their deliveries as Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde. Roth does is impressive as the rookie and shows his strengths at acting. Even Penn and Tierney deserve credit for their roles as father and son. They might not act like family but put a gun in one of their faces, the other will be at your throat. All together this a magnificent ensemble.Reservoir Dogs will go down in movie history as the gateway to a new generation of film making. Tarantino brings us one of the most unforgettable movies of all time. Thankfully he didn't let this movie go to his head too much and made more great films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and both of the Kill Bill movies. This movie will quickly become one of your favorites. You will not be disappointed...",10,1,3,27 August 2005
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Nightmare Italian Style
","The title of this movie is straight to the point. The film is about a group of Italian fascists who round up a group of young men and women, bring them to a mansion away from the rest of society, and basically do whatever their sick hearts want. There is everything from the eating of feces, walking people naked on leashes, and of course sodomy. As graphic and appalling as some of the scenes are, this film could have been a lot worse. Some of the dialogue here is excellent, bringing up some interesting conversations that have much to do with the story. It's basically a group of people who have unlimited power, playing out their twisted fantasies because they can without repercussions. Pasolini has some beautiful shots in this film as well. This is not for everyone.",8,1,3,10 June 2009
Don't Breathe," Don't mess with the blind man
","Don't Breathe is a tight, thriller that doesn't let up. There were several parts of the film where I was convinced we were nearing the end, only to be grabbed by the throat and dragged back in. Three young criminals are trying to get out of Detroit and onto bigger and better things. In order to do so they need cash, and lots of it. After receiving information on a potential big score, the group decides to go for it. The target is a blind, Iraq War veteran who is rumored to have $300,000 somewhere in his house. What looks like a cake walk turns into a nightmarish game of cat and mouse that will leave you truly holding your breath until the very end.Alvarez reunites with Jane Levy, his leading lady from Evil Dead. Levy really wowed me in that film and I was excited to see her in a new role with new scares. While some actors are remembered for their screams in horror films, it's Levy's eyes that stand out. They convey so much emotion, and given that a good amount of this film requires her character to remain silent, she pulls it off brilliantly. Accompanying Levy is veteran actor Stephen Lang as The Blind Man. Lang's screen and stage presence is well documented in productions like Gettysburg, Avatar, and as Col. Jessup in the original stage production of A Few Good Men. His intimidating physique makes him the perfect choice to play this role.Alvarez assembled a great team of actors, but his best selection might have been behind the camera with cinematographer Pedro Luque. He was the cinematographer for La Casa Muda, (The Silent House) a film that almost doesn't deserve the genius camera-work from Luque. He shot the film to appear like one continuous take and the result is truly unique. He didn't disappoint here either with some great tracking shots and an unforgettable chase scene in the basement.Luque's images are made even creepier thanks to brilliant sound design. Sound ups are common in horror films, and there are plenty to jump at in this film. While those work great they can be tiresome. I prefer the quiet moments. The shuffling of feet, creaking floor boards, and muffled breathing not only intensify the mood, they force the viewer to fill in the silence with their own imagination. It's like when you here something in your own home and you don't know what it is. You run through every possible scenario until you find the source.When the credits starting rolling I felt like I myself had spent the night in the house. With a run time of just under 90 minutes, they really jam packed every second of it. While the dialogue isn't anything to write home about (especially the first act), it doesn't detract from the story (I watch for scares, not for the conversations). A fine job all around and hopefully just the beginning of a long career for Alvarez. With two big films under his belt already, I can't wait to see what he has in store for us next!",8,6,14,26 August 2016
The Red Violin," Tainted Melody
","Corruption, fortune telling, lust, and revolution. Not exactly what is expected from a movie named The Red Violin (Le Violon Rouge).Writer/director Francois Girard's dark tale takes us on a journey following Nicolo Bussotti's masterpiece known only as 'the Red Violin', named for its unique red varnish. The Italian violin maker's wife, Anna, is soon going to be giving birth. The mother, wanting to know the future of her baby calls upon a servant to tell its future with the help of her Tarot cards. When the mother and baby die, Bussotti is left with nothing but his unfinished work. The most perfect violin in the entire world.The violin makes its way around Europe into the hands of an orphanage where the children all learn to play the violin. One boy in particular, Kaspar Weiss, is considered a child prodigy. He is taken in by Georges Poussin who hopes to make him into the next Mozart. The journey of the violin does not end here. The violin travels across Europe once more and eventually ends up in China. What was meant to be a gift has become In present-day Montreal, the violin that was once going to be the prize possession of Bussotti's baby is now up for auction. Several violin connoisseurs and enthusiasts are present to witness the unveiling of the magnificent stringed instrument, including Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson). A person from the violin's past is represented by family or organizations to claim it.It is rare to find a film with the main character being an inanimate object that travels so much. All of the characters are linked by this one instrument through one way or another. The violin's itself is steeped in mystery right until the very end of the film. Everywhere it goes there is one thing it carries with it: the ability to enchant, dazzle, and endanger those who come into contact with it.The film excels in all areas. The cinematography is extremely tasteful and compliments the Academy Award winning score with its flowing movements and well thought out shots. One scene in particular the violin changes hands several times yet it remains in the same part of the frame with each person. It almost appears that the world is revolving around the violin.The one part of the film that stands out has to be the story. The chopped up storytelling much like that of 21 Grams and Pulp Fiction (although not as chopped up and graphic) is incredibly hard to do. It can't be too hard to follow or too easy to figure out. Girard perfectly executes what it should be. The story is easy to follow but keeps you guessing the whole way through. Unlike some directors, Girard uses the languages of the countries that the violin travels through. Some would have had English all the way through. This story seems too real to be fiction.The Red Violin is an absolute joy to watch. It isn't one genre. There is mystery, crime, romance, drama, and scandal. The senses will be delighted with colors and sounds from all time periods and places. This is truly a great movie going experience.",9,2,3,16 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," This is fiction, understand?
","Ever look at a painting, see something, and have someone else see something completely different? This is important to comprehend before delving into the mystery and controversy that Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code takes you through. Whether it is Da Vinci's painting of The Last Supper or different geometric shapes around the world, just about anything you want to believe can be twisted and turned to fit a certain belief.Ron Howard's take on the book that has sold the most copies second only to the Bible, The Da Vinci Code is a fictional journey to figure out what the Catholic Church has been hiding for thousands of years. It is a thrill ride, uncovering secret societies that were believed to be nonexistent and exposing the untouchable. Mistaken identities, incredible theories, and astounding character revelations create the tip of the ice berg for The Da Vinci Code.The movie opens with the death of a man at the hands of what appears to be a derange monk. Following this murder is the introduction of Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), speaking at a Religious Symbology seminar for his new book. While signing autographs, the French authorities come to take Langdon to the murder. While there, he encounters Sophie Nevou (Audrey Tautou) who tells him he is in grave danger and Captain Fache (Jean Reno) is not one to be trifled with. From here on out, the duo rely on Langdon's capability of memory and decoding and Nevou's own history to guide them through a sea of madness, leading only to the truth about one of the most astounding questions in history: did Jesus have an offspring?To accompany them on their journey is Sir Leigh Teabing (Sir Ian McKellan), a Grail enthusiast bound to find out the truth behind Jesus's divinity, or mortality. The troublesome monk Silas (Paul Bettany) and his mentor Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) provide much needed suspense to the plot of the story. They are apart of the secretive order Opus Dei, portrayed at a murderous creed sprouting from the Catholic Church, trying to protect the world from something they need not know about.Again, this story is fiction. This must be understood before reading the book or in this case seeing the movie. To think that this is an attack at the Church and all of its teachings would mean the Indiana Jones trilogy is also trying to bring down Catholicism. Just because a story involves real groups doesn't make it true. Certainly, there are people who might take offense to what this film deals with. The film is meant to entertain and tell a riveting story.Without a doubt this is not just an ordinary film. It isn't groundbreaking or instrumental to cinema history. What it does, just as the book did, is grab hold of the audience and stays with them long after. Questions about the Knights of Templar and the truth behind Mary Magdeline don't just stay in the theatre, but stay with the person long after the credits roll. The film works on many levels other than the story. Howard's direction is right where it has been all these years; stellar. His mixture of real time, flashbacks, and even the thoughts the characters have are a delight for the senses. Accompanying his direction is Hans Zimmer's breathtaking score. Much like his other works, this is a spine-tingling soundtrack that is a perfect match with the film. On top of this is the acting. Although Hanks has had better characters, he does what is needed for Langdon. McKellan and Bettany truly shine in their roles as well.Movie goers alike can't deny the fact that this is an entertaining movie. Who is to say what is true and what is not true? This is the premise of faith. Faith is being able to believe in something and no matter what people say or what is presented your faith remains the same. The movie isn't a brainwashing tool, it is different way to tell a story. Entertainment. That is what this is.",8,1,3,21 May 2006
Zombieland," Zombies never learn
","Zombieland is exactly what it sounds like. Zombies are everywhere and they are hungry. In his feature film debut, director Ruben Fleischer presents an Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead, only this is more about the zombie killing. It stars of Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus. He plays one of the few remaining non-zombie humans left. He is methodical in his survival tactics and rarely takes chances. When he decides to head out of Texas and towards his hometown in Ohio, he encounters Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a Twinkie loving, zombie killing fanatic. The two team up and head on out of Texas.Along the way they run into more zombies and more non-zombies, including Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin). These presumably innocent little girls will stop at nothing to survive. They give Columbus and Tallahassee more than they bargained for.The theme of the film, like almost every zombie/post apocalyptic story, is survival. The characters don't give their real names, only their home towns for fear that they might become too attached to another person. Loneliness is part of the life when trying to survive a zombie epidemic, but having someone to talk to doesn't hurt, just as long as you're okay with killing them should they become infected. I though Shaun of the Dead dealt with this more than Zombieland did.Dealing with a zombie infestation means that you will more than likely have to kill someone. There is plenty of that here. The blood and gore is more on the comic side of the spectrum. It's over the top, very red, and not discreet whatsoever. It's cartoonish at times and never really grosses you out, unless that kind of stuff really bothers you, but I think for the most part the humor and the story will overlook it.For a movie about zombies this is a pretty smart film. There is a lot of physical humor, i.e. killing zombies, but it is wrapped up with funny dialogue and outlandish situations. Harrelson in particular is right on target here. Even Eisenberg does a good job. He is a more emotional Michael Cera, which is a good thing. There is a cameo by one of my favorite comedians, but I won't say who for fear of taking away from the surprise. Needless to say, I was in hysterics.I was surprised how invested I became with the characters. I knew this was a completely ridiculous plot and that zombies aren't real (at least this kind) so I expected just to go along for the ride. The characters are very well drawn out, each with a distinctive personality and back story. It made the film a little more enjoyable.",8,1,5,8 October 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," My friend's name is Optimus Prime, what's yours?
","The highly anticipated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has come out, and what a coming out it is. Bay delivers a 150 minute spectacle featuring a wide array of shiny cars, military vehicles, and of course, giant, transforming robots. Even though the film lasted two and half hours, I felt like my sensory receptors had been fried beyond repair.The film picks up right where the last film left off. For those who haven't seen the first film, it is of some importance to see it prior to Revenge, but it is not completely necessary. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is off to college to try and lead a normal life. Mikaela (Megan Fox) stays behind and tries to maintain their long distant relationship. They might be ready for a normalcy, but they aren't quite out of the woods just yet.Meanwhile, the Autobots have been working with the military to try and stop the Decepticon's from taking over the planet. Lead by Optimus Prime and Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the secret squadron stumbles upon a new plan to take over and could result in the destruction of the Autobots as well as the entire planet. The Autobots call for Sam's help once more, for he holds the key to Earth's safety and the destruction of the Decepticon armada. The answer has been imprinted onto his brain (don't worry how, it just was).The following is a wild goose chase that spans the globe. When we're not watching giant robots destroy everything in sight, there are only a few things left to do. Bay has mastered the art of distraction. He uses his characters and settings to fill up the gaps in between the action scenes. Fox's character in particular has a number of shots that have nothing to do with the scene or even the entire film. We all remember her pose looking under the hood of Sam's car in the first film. Well, there are about a dozen or more of those here. Yes, Megan Fox is attractive, but we can see her in magazines and on the Internet if we want pictures like that. The movie should be restricted to what is most important.Another distraction and time waster Bay uses are the car and military vehicle transitions. Whenever the transformers are driving around, it looks like a commercial for Chevy or GMC. All that is missing is a disclaimer on the bottom of the screen in regards to the low APR financing. These shots pale in comparison to the military shots. I know Bay has connections with just about ever branch of the armed services. He wants us to make sure we know it, too. He uses virtually every possible piece of hardware the military has to offer from ships to planes to tanks. There is even some water/hovercraft here. Why? Do we really need to show off what our country has? One or two might be okay, but we see a new one every time we change locations or start a new mission. It is a bit ridiculous.These distractions aside, there is a glaring flaw with the film and it lies within the screenplay. The story is too strung out and goes on way longer than it should be. This film doesn't have to have the greatest of plot twists or things like that. It needs to take us from one robot fight to the next. Let's face it, Transformers is not about the humans being saved but about the giant robots who run around blowing each other up scene after scene after scene. In between those scenes needs to be decent filler, something the first film had. The in between scenes here are annoying, poorly written, and could be condensed.With all of that against the movie, there is one major upside (that saves the movie) and it is the Transformers. They are big, loud, and full of energy. Here is an example of a film where slow motion is used positively. It's fun seeing Optimus Prime headlock and gut an enemy Decepticon. It's even more fun watching it in slow motion. What Bay accomplished in the first film was a sense that these fights were taking place in real locations with real people and environments interacting with the robots. He applies the same conditions here and on a much more epic scale.So it's not a great movie. It's too long, too cheesy, and confused at times. What it does offer is some guaranteed entertainment that just might make up for the near eleven dollar ticket price. If you don't expect a masterpiece and are looking to see some giant, killer robots wreak havoc on the world, enjoy.",2,3,9,24 June 2009
Crazy Heart," Whiskey and women; the life of a country music star
","Crazy Heart stars Jeff Bridges as Bad Blake, a country music singer whose glory days are behind him. He plays bars and bowling alleys, drinking and smoking his way into oblivion. At a two day stint in Santa Fe, Bad meets Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), an young reporter trying find her story. Just like a country song, the two fall for each other.Not all is well in the life of Bad Blake. His drinking and smoking habits have him on the ropes and he is always reminded of his former apprentice, Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell), and how successful he is. The two had a falling out and went their separate ways. Every day seems to be a reminder of what was and what could be, but might not be. Instead of sitting down and writing some more tunes, Bad finds solace in his never empty bottle of booze.Bad gets a shot at something special both in his career and in his love life. Jean offers some stability and Bad gets an offer to perform as Tommy's opening act, a sort of slap in the face to Bad, but it's a paycheck. He and Tommy reminisce about the old days of singing and drinking. With Jean and her young son, Bad finds a nice home, at least for a little while. Things go from better to worse when his drinking gets him in more trouble than he can chew.The story is a reminder of embracing the moment. Bad goes through his life mostly or partially intoxicated, missing a lot of good things and passing up on some potentially beneficial situations. Bridges gives his best performance in years. He is almost a serious Jeff Lebowski, a character he made famous in the 90s in Joel and Ethan Coen's The Big Lebowski. We sympathize with Bad Blake, though we never really feel sorry because it is his own fault really for being the way he is.Gyllenhaal gives a solid performance, as do Farrell in Robert Duvall, both taking smaller less significant roles. The real winner of this movie isn't the acting (though without Bridges, the film would not be nearly as good). The far and away best part of this movie is the music. Original tracks by T-Bone Burnett, Stephen Bruton, Ryan Bingham, Gary Nicholson, and Greg Brown. In These men put together a fantastic collection of well written and musically enticing tracks. The theme from the film entitled 'The Weary Kind' is one of the best original songs I've heard in a long time. Bingham and Burnett wrote it and Bingham performs it. His voice is crackly, as if he has been singing for 30 years or so. In reality Bingham is in his late 20s, but his voice is that of a veteran singer. It's a beautiful song and a perfect addition to the film. Other tracks like 'Fallin and Flying', 'Gone, gone, gone' and 'Hold on you' are fantastic.Overall a very good film. Bridges takes care of the acting portion and the rest is taken over by the music. Not that the rest of the film is particularly weak, I just think that those two pieces of the film are the strongest and stand out the most. It's a great story that people who are fans of country music will devour. I hope those people out there opposed to country music will give this film a shot. It will be well worth it.",9,1,3,18 February 2010
War of the Worlds," Dazzling effects give War of the Worlds an edge...
","In Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel War of the Worlds, Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a divorced father who has his kids Rachel and Robbie, played by Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin, over his home in New York. Suddenly the world is attacked by 'tripods' as they are called and havoc breaks loose. The sheer terror in the faces of people give the movie realistic qualities, even though it seems like this could never happen. When these visitors attack, people run, like any other 'When aliens attack' movie. What makes this movie so different from Independence Day and all others of this genre is the realism, the 'What is...' factor. M. Nigght Shamylan's Signs is another film that comes to mind, a movie that shows what would happen if regular people are thrown into an extraordinary situation. If you are in the mood to be dazzled, scared, and entertained, go see War of the Worlds.",8,1,6,30 June 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," The First Great War Movie
","Ever since Saving Private Ryan, the genre of war films has been changed for good. They all put war in full perspective, focusing on the special effects like explosions, gun shots, and their results on soldiers. But, some movies just use that to carry the film. For the most part, war has an impact on the mind. 'Shell shock' and other mental breakdowns are the result of warfare.All Quiet on the Western Front focuses on German Soldiers from recruiting in schools right up to fighting in the trenches. This war is not fought not just on the field of battle but in their heads. With their teachers influencing them to fight the good fight and die for your country, the boys think it is gonna be fun and exciting. Boot camp is a wake up call and they don't like it. They despise their commanding officer and play tricks on him. Soon it is time to go to the front, the Western front. Their they meet other soldiers, much older and war savvy. The battle there is to find food. Constant bombardment from shells by the French force the German's to stay in their trenches and try to wait it out. This could go on for days but for these men, they have no choice.Through the course of the movie, the men talk about why they are fighting and how nobody knows. Women, good food from home, and the small luxuries they left behind are all tossed aside to fight a war they don't even understand. When the war gets to the men, they make rash choices. Men are dying all around them and all they can do is sit and talk about something else. This piece of anti-war propaganda really does a fine job of illustrating the hardships and harshness of war. The first world war is turned into the first great war movie.",10,3,5,15 July 2005
Downfall," The Last Days of Adolf Hitler
","When we think of World War II, we think of epic battles and storming beaches. There was the naval battles in the Pacific and the land warfare in Europe. One of the most infamous people of WWII was Adolf Hitler, a man that brainwashed an entire nation into believing in his cause. Considered one of the most powerful evil geniuses in history, his final days were not so cunning. The last days of Adolf Hitler can now be seen.In Oliver Hirschbiegel's epic Downfall (USA title), we see the end of WWII for the German's. Berlin is surrounded and Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is running out of options fast. He and his staff of experienced commanders are now faced with a huge decision, stay in Berlin and try to fight off the Russian's, or surrender and try to make a peace treaty. Hitler will have no talk of surrender, for he would rather commit suicide than see his country beg for mercy. His newly acquired secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is caught up in the mess of things. The Russian's are closing in on the city and the morale is fading fast amongst Hitler's commanders.In the streets, there are those who are loyal to the Nazi party and Hitler's reign. They fight till they have no bullets left and then end their life. There are those who hide in the ruins of the once prosperous city. Hitler and all of his cabinet are stationed underground to avoid any bombings from the invaders. It is here that the commands are sent out and the roots of treason are mended. One by one some of Hitler's 'top dogs' start to open negotiations with the US, England, and Russia, issuing the surrender of Germany due to Hitler's incapacity to continue his rule. Upon hearing the news of his commander's treachery, the Fuhrer is enraged, wanting them arrested and executed. Soon, everyone in the bunker is feeling anxious of Hitler's next move.Hirschbiegel's film is a masterpiece, delivering on many levels. What is shown on film is a powerful portrait of one of the most sinister men to walk the earth. He is scene as the Fuhrer, a man who with order can kill hundreds and thousands of innocent people...because he can. Then there is the side people don't see, the real Adolf Hitler. This is what Traudl sees and what Eva Braun has come to love in him. His spirit almost broken, Hitler looks as if he has aged way beyond his years. Ganz is brilliant as the Fuhrer and gives him human qualities when he is usually looked at as a monster.Downfall is a stunning account of the last days in Adolf Hitler's bunker. The final battles between the Russian's and the German's are coming to an end. This is the downfall of the Nazi Regime, and the entire globe is waiting for the biggest war ever to come to an end...",9,2,5,6 August 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," How can you not love this movie???
","Will Ferrell in my mind is the new face of comedy. With his 'out there' style and non stop, joke a minute attitude, he can make anyone of any age give a chuckle. This movie is one of the funniest movies ever and should be ranked up there with Dumb and Dumber and Duck Soup.The setting in Sand Diego during the 1970's is perfect for Ferrell so he can flaunt a perfectly trimmed mustache and burgundy suit. He is out there and loving every minute of it.Along with Ferrell is his News Team consisting of Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and David Koechner. Individually you have funny, but together, the five create comedy that is so funny you just might wet your pants!With Christina Applegate as the rival female reporter/Ron's lover, there is a plot going on, but it is overtaken by the endless lines dished out from this team of jokesters.Of course, where there is Will Ferrell, there are his friends. Cameo's by Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, and even Tim Robbins make up the rivalry news teams.It's hard to miss with a Will Ferrell movie, although I saw this movie opening week, it still brings me to tears when Ron Burgundy warms up for the evening news...",8,0,1,30 June 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Literature meets Life
","The narrator is a very important component of literature. In order for a story to be told, there has to be someone telling it. It can be an outsider, the person involved, or someone known only as 'The Narrator'. Life, however, doesn't have a narrator. People have the power of free will.For Harold Crick, life isn't as care free. His life is being told to him. In Marc Forster's film Stranger Than Fiction, Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent, has lived his life in solitude, to the tick of his wristwatch. For no apparent reason, on what seemed to be an ordinary Wednesday morning, Crick can hear a woman narrating his life on while he brushes his teeth.This voice that only Crick can hear is of acclaimed writer Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson). Eiffel hasn't published a book in nearly a decade. Her publisher sends Penny Escher (Queen Latifah) to her rid her of 'writer's block'. All of Eiffel's troubles rest on one predicament: how to kill Harold Crick.It seems like Crick is just going to have to deal with this 'voice' when all of a sudden while waiting at the bus stop, the voice tells Crick of his 'imminent death'. When looking for help, he is placed in the lap of literature theorist Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Like everyone else, Hilbert believes that Crick is crazy, but is willing to give his literary advice to Crick to see whether or not that his life is a comedy or a tragedy. In other words, will Crick end up dying or 'getting hitched'? To make things more complicated, Crick must audit an anarchistic baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whom he becomes attracted to. She becomes his obsession and a way of finding out whether or not his life will end up being a comedy or a tragedy.Director Forster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland) along with up and coming writer Zack Helm deliver a heartfelt film. The film itself looks really nice. Crick's life is surrounded by routine and he sees and does things that a normal person wouldn't. Forster's makes his world look like it is filled with diagrams and timers like a futuristic touch screen. Slow motion shots and fantastic dream sequences make this a visual feast.The cast is perfect. Ferrell's performance is original compared to his other characters in Old School and Elf. His timing is perfect and his delivery, delightful. This could be his Lost in Translation. Along with Ferrell is Hoffman, who together deliver some of the funniest dialogues on film. The cagey veteran Hoffman has such a wide range in his acting from The Graduate to Rain Man, and it shows. He is always spicing up the screen with his characters.The leading ladies deliver superb performances. Thompson is paranoid and jittery, perfect for the troubled author. Also a veteran actress, Thompson's composure and presence gives more substance to the film. Gyllenhaal's 'fight the power' attitude along with her tattoo's make her the perfect love interest for Ferrell. She can be so nasty and still be desirable. Latifah's performance, although a minor role, is a step back in the right direction for the Oscar nominated actress (Chicago).All it needed was a great script. Helm's fresh style of writing is a breathe of fresh for the screen. The story itself is very original and exemplifies his unique way of thinking. The future is bright for Helm.There is a lot of buzz surrounding the film. The Oscar season is just beginning with many highly anticipated releases coming up. Stranger Than Fiction is a hopeful at the 2007 Academy Awards in several categories. With some many variables not yet accounted for, it is too early to decide.There are laughs across the entire spectrum of comedy from the blatantly funny to the more complex jokes. There are even some heavy moral issues that provoke some thinking for the audience. Stranger Than Fiction is guaranteed to strike a cord.",9,0,2,14 November 2006
Ray," Jaimie Foxx Brings Ray Charles to Life!
","Every now and then, a film comes along and shows a talented actor doing an impersonation of some one famous or not, and really hits home with it. The movie Ray. starring Jamie Foxx (Collateral, Any Given Sunday) as Ray Charles Robinson, has set the bar to an unreachable height.Ray shows the rise and near fall of the musical entertainer Ray Charles Robinson. The film depicts Ray as a musical genius who is haunted by memories from his childhood. His struggle to rise to the top and to keep from losing fame is hard on his wife played by Kerry Washington (Save the Last Dance). She has to deal with his drug addiction to heroin and his love affairs on tour. Regina King (Down to Earth) plays one of his 'Raylet' background singers who he winds up having an affair with.Academy Award® winning Director Taylor Hackford (Devil's Advocate, An Officer and a Gentleman) incorporates the sensational music of Ray Charles with the controversial issues of the era like drug abuse, civil rights, and 'devil lyrics'. The flashbacks to his childhood are used to get a point across like not using handicaps and showing how he became blind.Jamie Foxx started out as a comic on the TV show 'In Living Color' and has recently been appearing in serious dramatic roles. His uncanny resemblance to Ray Charles adds to the effect given off by his Oscar® worthy performance. His delivery makes this his best performance to date.Ray is one of the best pictures of 2004 and will be talked about for years to come. Foxx's win for Best Actor was well deserved. Hopefully this is just the beginning for Foxx and Hackford.",9,3,5,1 July 2005
Inception," What dreams may come
","Inception will no doubt make Nolan an untouchable in the pantheon of filmmakers. Inception knows no boundaries and asks you to leave all preconceived notions of storytelling behind you. This is a gravity defying thrill ride.We follow Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man who can enter a person's dream and unlock their deepest secrets, or plant an idea that could potentially transform the person. Haunted by his past, Cobb is forced into exile in Europe where he and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon- Levitt) work as a team in attempting to crack other people's dreams. When they come across a very powerful man, Saito (Ken Watanabe), Cobb is given the opportunity to regain his previous life and return to his family. All he has to do is pull off a nearly impossible job.Cobb assembles a team of architects, forgers, and chemists. Fueled by Saito's money, the team attempts to crack the mind of one of Saito's leading competitors and persuade him to dissolve his company. Due to time constraints, the job must be planned relatively quickly and without delay. This is Cobb's last shot at a normal life. He doesn't want to lose it.To explain the full mechanics of the film wouldn't be such a terrible thing to do to you, the reader, but it would take away from the joy of figuring it out. How this task of cracking dreams and inserting ideas (called inception) is complicated and involves many levels. I assure you that you will not be completely lost. Key aspects of the film are easily picked up as it progresses. What I love about this story is that Nolan doesn't take a concept and over analyze it. He just tells us briefly what it is and then moves on. Rather than having a character go on and on about one particular piece of information, we are given almost all the information needed in a short span of time, allowing for more plot development.The story doesn't succeed by itself. Thanks to fantastic performances by the entire cast, we are given a marvelous film. DiCaprio leads the way with a strong leading role. He is supported by one of my favorites in Gordon-Levitt, whose career is really taking off in a big way. I was glad Ellen Page did not play a Juno type role and broke her adolescent shell. Watanabe was solid (as always). The rest of the cast including Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Michael Cane, and Tom Berenger performed beautifully. I especially loved Hardy's character who was a major contributor in the action department.Speaking of action, this film is riddled with special effects, the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan uses a lot of special effects in his films both CG enhanced and live action. It's when he makes the CG special effects look real that I get excited. Through an intricate use of wire stunts and trick photography, Nolan gives us one of the most complex and visually astounding fight sequences put onto film. It reeked of Kurbrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, defying the laws of physics and creating laws of his own to follow.Nolan's right hand man since Menento has been Wally Pfister, his cinematographer. The way the camera moves effortlessly through each shot, utilizing lighting and the space of the frame is outstanding. Nolan and Pfister have made some of the more beautiful films in recent memory from the grungy streets of London in The Prestige to the always sunny and sometimes foggy shores of Alaska in Insomnia, not to mention Gotham City in both Batman features.Another aspect of Nolan's films that I have come to expect great things from is the score. He again employs the help of Hans Zimmer whose outstanding work ranges from the light and family oriented The Lion King to the much more serious and adult Gladiator. His talents can suit almost any need. Nolan has used him on three films including Inception, and this one by far takes the cake. It takes on a life of it's own. Although the story virtually consumes you so you can't focus on anything else, if you take a second and drag yourself back to reality you can hear his wonderful score heightening the action (I strongly recommend purchasing/downloading the soundtrack).I undoubtedly will talk about this film more and more as the months go on and especially as award season approaches, but for the time being I will conclude by giving my highest recommendation for you to go see this film. Not once, not twice, but as much as possible. You will not be disappointed. The ending will take your breath away.",10,3,8,21 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Ritchie continues to impress
","Guy Ritchie has made three fine action/comedy films since 1998, starting with Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, and RocknRolla (I still need to see his 2005 film Revolver). He has a distinct style of film-making using slow motion, flashbacks, pauses, heavy British, Scottish, and Irish accents, and like many fine filmmakers of the day, a very strong musical soundtrack. With the exception of Swept Away, he tends to focus on the British underworld of gangsters, hit men, and junkies. He is quite good at telling these stories and one would naturally think that his next venture would be along those same lines.Then came Sherlock Holmes.I wasn't completely on board with this one. After seeing the film, I can confidently say that I am on board for this one.Robert Downey Jr. plays the famous British private detective. Along with him is his faithful sidekick Dr. Watson, played by Jude Law who steals the movie for me. He was by far the biggest surprise. I wasn't all over the idea of changing the somewhat reserved character of Dr. Watson into a rough and tough soldier turned doctor. I couldn't have been more wrong.We find Holmes and Watson fowling up the plans of Lord Blackwood, a powerful man who dabbles in the dark arts. Following his execution, Dr. Watson decides it is time to leave his partner and settle down with his wife to be. Sherlock has his qualms about the separation from his faithful assistant, but those are brushed aside when reports of Lord Blackwood rising from the grave start circulating. With Holmes back on the case, he does everything he can to get Watson back on the job with him.Like I said, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I didn't think Ritchie's modern style would translate well to this story. What makes it work is his use of modern camera techniques and special effects to help bring to life the legend of Sherlock Holmes. The fight scenes are backed up by some period inspired music and the costume design, art direction, and set design all contribute in creating the right atmosphere for the story.Like I said earlier, Law played a very different yet favorable Watson. Downey Jr. was not perfect for the role but his accent was first rate and I especially liked his voice overs when he would play out a situation in his head before it would happen (although some of the credit goes to Ritchie and the editing department). The rest of the cast was fine, though I wasn't completely sold on McAdams in her role.There isn't anything groundbreaking about this one, just a fun movie with a cool story. It's blatantly obvious that Ritchie intends to make a sequel regardless of the box office revenue (which should be enough to call for a sequel), though he set up RocknRolla for a sequel and I'm not sure if that is going to happen any time soon. I hope it does, but I think he needs another Sherlock Holmes movie to go through and then take some time to work on a good story for a RocknRolla sequel.",8,1,2,4 January 2010
Rango," The Ballad of Rango
","Rango, director Gore Verbinski's (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, The Weather Man) first foray into animation, is a mesmerizing display of both animation and storytelling. We follow a chameleon, voiced wonderfully by the talented Johnny Depp, whose life is turned upside down when he finds himself stranded in the desert. After an encounter with a hawk, our chameleon friend runs into another critter of the desert, a lizard named named Beans (Isla Fisher), who brings the chameleon into town.In the town of Dirt we meet an array of strange looking characters, all of which seem to be confused and curious about this newcomer the chameleon. Now, our friend who remains nameless up until this point, is an actor by trade, though I guess you could call it desire, who is in search of finding his own identity. When approached with the question of who he really is, he quickly comes up with the back story for...Rango.Rango quickly becomes the town's new hero/sheriff. His first task is to settle the unpleasantness surrounding the towns water supply, which dwindles day by day. With the help of Beans and some of the other locals, Rango gets a posse together to find the missing water. Should he fail, the future of Dirt looks mighty grim.This movie had the potential to be a cheesy, kid-joke infused, chaotic romp and a poor excuse of a western. Yet just the opposite happened. The jokes are witty, it is very controlled, and it is an excellent western, certainly one of the best since the millennium. The very opening scene with the soon to be named Rango is so clever and unexpected that I thought Nickelodeon had never even screened the movie before being released. There are so many one liners and visuals that go completely, and I mean completely over the younger audience's still developing head. There are some laugh out loud moments for them, but I don't think they will really understand what is going on for most of the movie.There are guns, explosions, and chases to keep them busy, not to mention a fair dose of falls, whacks, and kerplunks. The kids will be fine. It's the adults that really get to enjoy this movie. I would go so far as to say that adults should call a babysitter to forgo any questions their children might have like, 'Why are you laughing?'Depp's performance, and I do mean performance, is remarkable. My brother said that he didn't even think it was Johnny Depp. Depp, whose face and on screen persona is so hard to dismiss, is hidden well behind the uneven eyes of his reptilian persona. His talents along with the entire cast, whose voice acting turned into real acting behind the scenes (I strongly encourage you all to watch the featurettes online) turned out stellar performances similar to those from Wes Anderson's 2009 masterpiece Fantastic Mr. Fox.Verbinski's animation team deserves a great deal of praise as well. The textures and attention to detail rivals that of Pixar, who invented the process of CG feature films. The landscapes, dreamscapes, and everything in between is second to none. The most important part of the animation and perhaps the whole movie is the work done on each individual face. Each character pops off the screen. Usually such craftsmanship is reserved for the main character, the villain, and a few secondary characters (i.e. Carl Frederickson, Russell, Dug, and Charles F. Muntz from Pixar's Up), but here each character, regardless how much screen time they are allowed, is given their own unique features. It's some of the best animation I have ever seen, and that is not an exaggeration.This tightly woven animated movie is a sight to be seen. Need I forget to mention, you don't have to break the bank to see it in 3D. Would it have looked nice, maybe, but this is sure proof that 2D is alive and well in the land of animated films. Will it fluff up those box office numbers, no, but will it win over the hearts of millions like me, starving for some real good animation outside of Disney and Pixar, you betcha.",10,2,5,13 March 2011
Despicable Me," It's so cute you might die
","Despicable Me is the latest animated film in what appears to be an endless assault of 3D cinema. Luckily for us this movie actually does a fairly decent job of utilizing the 3D technology in creating a pleasant looking and functional 3D landscape. Here we follow a master villain named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) who aims to become the worlds most notorious super villain. Along with the help of Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) and a host of little, yellow creatures known as the 'minions' (though Gru knows each one by name), Gru finally gets his shot when he attempts to steal the moon. The only problem is he doesn't have the weapon needed or the money. Not to mention he is being out-hustled by Vector (Jason Segel), a young, upstart of a villain with more money and one big heist already under his belt.In order for his plan to succeed, Gru requires the help of three orphan girls, which he adopts, and misleads them into helping his evil cause. What appears to be a simple plan turns out to be disaster and ultimately leads to Gru connecting with the girls and distracting him from his master plan.There's a point during this movie where I just gave up analyzing the story and how it makes sense and just sat there and watched, taking each joke one line at a time and then moving on to the next one. It kind of worked. The story and the logic doesn't really matter, like where the minions come from, why Gru became a villain, or why he doesn't try to go after something easier.The crowd favorite was without a doubt Agnes, the youngest of the orphan girls that Gru adopts. She looks like a bobble head doll with puppy dog eyes and an obsession with unicorns. She is the punchline in just about every scene she is in, but that works. As far as moving the story along, she does nothing to that effect. To be quite honest there really only needs to be one girl, but having three personalities gives us some variety. Even though there could probably be a solution that doesn't involve using the girls, it is necessary for the girls to try and change Gru into a better person.In regard to the voice acting, this is a pretty solid performance all around. Carell does a pretty decent job while the others almost go out of their way to not sound like their real selves, which is refreshing. Unlike Dreamworks films which is basically just hiring big name stars to talk into a microphone with some feeling, just some. Brand does a nice job as well as Segel, but I was very surprised to see others like Will Arnett, Kristin Wiig, and out of left field...Julie Andrews! All of which did a sufficient job.After looking past overwhelming cutesy nature of the film, this is actually a pretty well made film. I would absolutely recommend seeing this in 3D. The 3D isn't as fluid as Avatar, but nothing will be for a while (except maybe Toy Story 3, but that's a different story entirely). The characters are so disproportionate in all physical areas, which can be amusing, but after a while you don't even notice. The big winner here is the depth. I feel like every time I talk about 3D movies this is my number one concern, but it helps so much. It makes an average scene look great and a great scene look spectacular. There are examples of both in this film. Some parts had hints of genius, only to be followed by a slap of cuteness that almost ruins the moment. Almost.This is just a fun film that kids and adults can go see together and not sit in agony. I would fork up the money for the 3D if you can to really give you the full experience (especially during the end credits). I wouldn't go too out of my way to see this one, but I wouldn't avoid it either.",7,5,9,14 July 2010
Mary and Max," An animated life
","In 2004, Adam Elliot took home Oscar gold with his animated short film Harvie Krumpet, a film about the life of a simple man named Harvie Krumpet who tries to learn as much as he can about life. He used stop motion animation, a form of animation that is most commonly linked with TV Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. The film is somewhat grim, funny, and heartfelt, something that this type of animation is rarely scene with.Five years later, Elliot comes back with his first feature film Mary and Max. As impressed as I was with Harvie Krumpet I was doubly impressed with this one. He uses the same style of animation only this time his skills are much more precise, detailed, and effective. He tells the story of Mary Daisy Dinkle, a young girl living in 1970s Australia who has no friends except for her pet rooster and favorite television show. One day she decides to reach out across the world to someone who might be her friend. She finds a New York City phone book picks out a random name: Max Jerry Horovitz.Max lives alone in his apartment with his one eyed cat and pet fish (who he needs to constantly replace). He is an overweight, middle aged man with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism. He too has no friends and is in need of some companionship, although he is somewhat afraid of the outside world and strangers. He finally decides to write her back, and the two begin their friendship across the sea.The film is comprised of narration, by Barry Humphries, and voice over from Mary and Max reading their letters, voiced by Bethany Whitmore as younger Mary, Toni Collette as older Mary, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Max. Their letters and the in between narration is hysterical and incredibly clever. I like the little tidbits we are given like the way Mary's mother drinks her sherry and how Max eats chocolate hot dogs, his own recipe. They make the characters more interesting.Elliot creates a vivid world filled with right and wrong. He uses colors to define the two different continents, giving Australia brown and earthy tones while New York is black, white, and everything in between, with the exception of a red pompom that Mary sends Max. Much like their separate worlds, they both blend in as if no one else would notice them. These characters are simple, average people who go the distance to make their lives a little more comfortable. It's sublime to see these characters grow up through the years and age and learn. We become so attached.There is so much to love about this movie. The quirky little one liners to the incredibly detailed and well done stop motion animation. Each character has clearly defined features, unique movement, and like so many stop motion pieces, there is nothing jumpy or out of place about the animation. It is smooth, coherent, and compelling to watch. As impressive as it is the writing is just as good. You really get a feeling for these characters through the narration and their writing. If there was some way you could help them out you would. They are just so lovable.This is one of the best films I have seen this year. It's a wonderful film aimed at a more mature audience. I don't know if it can compete with Disney and Pixar's Up, but I wouldn't be surprised to see this at least get a nomination from the Academy, as it has already been honored at this year's Berlin International Film Festival. It's a great achievement when a film can make you feel so happy the entire way through.",10,22,41,29 October 2009
Vanilla Sky," So much to say, but I am speechless...
","Cameron Crowe has written and directed some pretty good movies over the years. Starting with Say Anything in 1989, Jerry McGuire in 1996, and Almost Famous in 2000. But these movies don't compare to the complexity and splendor that is Vanilla Sky.In this American version of Abre los Ojos, Tom Cruise stars as David Aames, a rich publisher, thanks to his father, who has it all. His 'buddy' named Julie (Cameron Diaz) is a little jealous about him meeting this girl at a party named Sophia (Penelope Cruz), who he was introduced to by his client and best friend Brian (Jason Lee). Brian is falling for Sophia but is sort of OK with Daivd making the first move. Julie becomes jealous and crashes her car with David in it. She dies and David is left disfigured. Basically, David's entire life is starting to turn upside down and doesn't even know what is real and what isn't. Intertwining throughout the movie is David talking to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) in prison, awaiting his sentence for a crime he doesn't think he committed. What happens next is hard to explain, and also would ruin the movie.This movie couldn't have been written any better. Cameron Crowe is on the top of his game. This smart, entertaining story of what happens to a man when reality seems to slip away is magnificent. The five main characters are phenomenal. Cruise, Cruz, Diaz, Russell, and Lee all give some of their best work to date. Although the plot seems to be confusing at times, Crowe does a nice job of explaining everything so it all ties together nicely. Vanilla Sky is a masterpiece. The screenplay is reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Everyhthing put together makes Vanilla Sky one hell of a ride. 'This is a revolution of the mind...'",7,1,2,11 July 2005
Tombstone," Justice is now in session...
","When you think of the 'Wild, Wild West', saloons, sheriffs, shoot-outs, and cowboys are some of the things you might think of as essential to painting a portrait of the old west. Well, this movie shows just that, but not in a cheesy, run of the mill sort of way. This is the story of Tombstone.Tombstone stars Kurt Russell as the legendary Wyatt Earp, the U.S. Marshall known for 'keeping the peace'. He and his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton) decide to head out to the town of Tombstone. It's a place where you can make it rich and quick, too. Wyatt decides to grab a share of the local saloon/casino called The Oriental. Making all of this money and having a good time is all they want to think about. They just want to leave they're past behind them. Doc Holiday (Val Kilmer) wants to do the same thing. With his lung condition worsening, he is trying to live life to the fullest...that is gambling, drinking, smoking, and doing his 'marital duties' with his wife Kate. A traveling group of actors and performers roll into town put on a show for Tombstone. Josephine Marcus (Dana Delaney) and Mr. Fabian (Billy Zane) sweep the town off of their feet with their charm and talents. Josephine is attracted to Wyatt's ruggedness and mystery. Wyatt tries not to be tempted even though his drug addicted girl friend doesn't help his cause much. With all of this going on in Tombstone it seems like it will be easy sailing for Wyatt and his crew...until they have a run in with the Cowboys.Led by Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe), this gang has been terrorizing the west for a number of years. They are the law in the town of Tombstone. They influence everything from the sheriff to the saloons. When the local marshal is shot by Curly Bill, Wyatt locks him up this is when the cowboys start to make trouble. Virgil and Morgan soon sign up as the new Sheriff's in town and Wyatt doesn't want any part of it. Doc has become enemies with one of the quickest and skilled guns in the west named Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn). When Wyatt is forced into help keep the peace, there is the showdown at the O.K. Carral that would just become more of the legend of Wyatt Earp and his band of law men.Tombstone is a great film with a lot of action, drama, and even some comedic moments. The screenplay is fantastic with Wyatt Doc having some great conversations. Russell, Kilmer, Elliott, and Paxton all give good performances. Kilmer especially shows his range as an actor with his charm and charisma not scene in this way before. The ailing Doc Holiday is an interesting character to portray and Kilmer nails it. Along with Doc, Wyatt couldn't be just another law enforcer. He had to have a soft side and a mean streak as well. Russell give Wyatt a feeling of accomplishment, like he has done what he has set out to do. But when things go wrong, he is the first one you want on your side.Fans of westerns, have no fear because Tombstone is hear! This magnificent film is worth more than one viewing and I'm sure you'll agree.",7,4,5,21 August 2005

We are led to believe that Sunnyside is a sort of retirement home for toys where they will have nothing else but endless days of being played with. Everyone is on board but Woody, who feels it is his duty to return to Andy. Before he can return home he is found by a girl named Bonnie, who take him home with her.While Woody tries to get back to Andy, things aren't as smooth as they should be at Sunnyside. Rather than being played with they are mishandled and abused by toddlers. It appears that they were lied to. Now everyone is in the wrong place and it is only just a few days before Andy leaves for college.I was blown away by the quality of the story. Aside from Up this might be Pixar's most adult film. There are a lot of allusions to the previous films with catchphrases and mannerisms, but this movie hits home in a big way. I think we all have had a moment where we have come across a toy that was once so highly regarded and prized but has fallen away due to maturation and time. There is a moment where you realize that this toy has had its run and it will either be passed down, passed on, or thrown away. In real life it might not be as hard, but when looking at it through the eyes of these toys, it's heartbreaking.This film and the two previous have all been a focused on identity. In Toy Story Woody can't handle not being the number one toy in Andy's life so he tries to eliminate the competition, only to realize that he is not being forgotten, just that he is a piece to a bigger puzzle. In the second film Woody sees what his past was and how important he is to other people, but what truly matters is who loves him the most, and that is Andy. Here Woody refuses to let go of Andy because he isn't ready. What he learns along with the rest of the group is that they have fulfilled their duty and they must let go.Thematic elements aside, this is an extremely well done film. I can't say that the animation is better because they are using the same characters in the same world, but compared to the previous films in the series, this looks the best by far. In just their second attempt at making a 3D film, they have succeeded beautifully, though I don't think it is necessary to see it in 3D like how I felt about Up.The new characters are a lot of fun. Lotso, Ken, Trixie, Mr. Pricklepants, and Buttercup have great personalities are are voiced by excellent actors (Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Kristen Schaal, Timothy Dalton, and Jeff Garlin respectively). Like all Pixar films, they choose the right voice for the character, not the right choice for the marquee. Granted, these are pretty much all well established actors, but it's their talents that make them worth it.I had mixed feelings going into this film. Toy Story is one of my favorite films and I hate to see a good thing turned into a bad one. I am happy to say that I feel so happy knowing that they took they're time in turning out a great film as well as a perfect ending for a great franchise. For those on the fence about going, do yourself a favor and see this one. It's worth it, but don't feel like you need to see it in 3D. I think it would work perfectly well in regular 2D.",9,1,2,20 June 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," The rebirth of a dying franchise
","The first sequel to 20th Century Fox's Ice Age, Ice Age: The Meltdown, was awful. There was nothing redeemable about the film. The writing was bad, the animation hadn't improved, and the story along with it's characters were rushed and predictable. The franchise was virtually dead in the water.This summer brought Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, the company's first 3D endeavour. Since most animated films coming out nowadays are heading towards the third dimension, it seemed necessary that this would follow suit. After seeing a few of the 3D films this year this was nothing spectacular, but it was definitely on par with the rest.The film starts off with Scrat (the squirrel) finding another female squirrel and the two of them fighting over the beloved acorn. Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) are expecting their first child and Manny is not handling being a father very well. Diego (Dennis Leary), sensing that his time with the 'herd' is almost up, is on the verge of leaving for good. Meanwhile Sid (John Leguizamo) tries to start a family of his own by swiping some idle dinosaur eggs. This opens up a whole can of worms, resulting in the mother dinosaur stealing her babies along with Sid and venturing back home to her world under the surface.The remaining members of the herd follow him below the surface to a Journey to the Center of the Earth type realm where the meet their guide, Buck (Simon Pegg), a lone weasel whose cunning is almost as great as his madness. It is up to him to bring them safely through the jungle without being eaten by the dreaded monster Rudy.The story is nothing out of the ordinary but it doesn't disappoint by any means. Where the film excels is in the writing. There are jokes here and there for the kids, after all it is a children's movie, but for the most part an adult will feel pretty satisfied on the whole with the humor. The problems the characters face are not that uncommon for most adults. There are family issues like pregnancy, fatherhood, and other issues like finding a sense of belonging and whether or not you can still keep up with the rest of the world.The animation compliments the story quite nicely. There are some cheap gimmicks with the 3D effects but they aren't over the top. The layering of the objects in the background and foreground are excellent, giving the film great depth. There are some neat motion shots and point of view shots throughout the film that give it a cool feel.I'm not really promoting you see this film but if you have the chance to I would say don't be scared. It's a cool little film that has a lot to offer for all ages. I don't think they should make another one, but after all the money this film is making tallies up I think they might have to. That could be very bad. Or not. We'll see.",7,0,3,19 July 2009
Before Sunrise," Seize The Day
","Do you ever wonder how many people we meet in our lifetime? Not just the people whom we converse with, enjoy their company, absolutely loathe, and even the ones you wish you never knew. But the people we walk by, take a glance at, and stay on our path. What if by some chance you stopped and actually struck up a conversation with one of them? Where would it lead you? It could be a dead end conversation that last no more than 30 seconds. It could encourage a heated conversation, argument, or just spontaneous chatter going off in all directions.It could lead to a whirlwind romance that will change your life forever.A man and a woman meet on a train for the first time and without even exchanging each others names they decide to spend the day together. Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise is that time spent by Jesse and Celine in Vienna. A chance meeting that would alter their lives in such a drastic way.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is finishing up his tour of Europe and is a day away from a flight back home to the states leaving from Vienna. On the train to the city, he sees Celine (Julie Delpy) who is returning to Paris from visiting her Grandmother. Once 'chit-chat' develops into a heartfelt conversation, the two realize that this is more than what it seems. There is a vibration between them that is more than the train car.Jesse pops the question. Not 'the question', but asking her if she would like to spend the day with him in Vienna. She thinks, and thinks, and grabs her things and the two walk off the train not knowing where they would end up going.These two complete strangers decide to break off from their paths and go off into uncharted territory. They don't even ask each others names until they have stepped off the train. Those words passed down from parent to child through the generations forbidding children to talk to strangers must have slipped passed these two. What is so radical and provocative is that they have no idea about the others background or intentions let alone their name. This train sequence could have been over dramatic and had the two linked somehow by a distant relative or were in the same high school and didn't even know it. Two different countries, one train car, two lives that would never be the same.Linklater showcases the beauty and seduction of Vienna using a number of angles and techniques depending on the area. Fountains, bridges, river ways, and even the train cars have a romantic essence about them. It is the perfect setting for two strangers to go gallivanting about for a day to get a taste of a new foreign city, but more importantly to build up an everlasting friendship.At first their day starts off awkward and almost turns into a big mistake. They overcome this through snappy and intelligent dialogue that isn't just about past memories of friendship and relationships. Linklater delves into the realm of how things work on a grander scale. God, dreams, love, and family all are thrown into perspective.Can a relationship last a day? No. It can take place in a day but it lasts a lifetime. Jesse and Celine are forever together no matter what continent they live on. Before Sunrise is the time they have together until their departure. One day can fill up a lifetime of memories. Are you willing to try?",10,1,2,27 February 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Anderson strikes again
","When a director whose films have taken on a steady fan base decides to change direction with an entirely new genre, it's a risky move. None as risky as Wes Anderson's latest work Fantastic Mr. Fox, his animated feature film debut. I can't think of any filmmakers going behind the camera of an animated film having been this successful in live action.Well, his risk has payed off and I am confident in saying that Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the year's best. It is based on the classic children's book of the same name by famed writer Roald Dahl. It's the story of a fox who gets the idea of stealing from three of the meanest local farmers: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. It has been many years since I have read the book, but it was an excellent read when growing up.When I saw that Anderson was making this film, I was as anxious as ever. Then I saw the trailer and all my worries went away. Anderson is able to transfer his style to animation flawlessly. His use of tracking side shots, symmetric division of the screen with his characters, colorful sets, and his amazing soundtrack with both original tracks and carefully selected tracks from other artists like Burl Ives, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones.Rather than just getting a bunch of big name actors in a sound studio one at a time, Anderson devised a system where he actually the recorded the actors acting out what their characters are doing. Be it eating, rolling, or digging, the actors performed their actions along with their lines. The film features some of Anderson's stars from other films like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wallace Woldarsky, and Michael Gamdon, as well as two important lead performances by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. I love the casting Anderson chose for each character. I don't think it could have gone any better.Anderson uses stop animation wonderfully here. It gives the characters a certain edge to them and it makes them wacky enough and serious enough so that kids and adults can enjoy the whole production. It's rated PG and I think that parents will agree that some of the film just isn't for kids, and that is not a knock against the film. I just don't think kids will really get what Anderson is trying to accomplish here. It's not too graphic or inappropriate but some of the humor is a little over their heads. No worries though, kids will love it and will not be harmed by it in any way.There is so much to enjoy here. The clever writing, the beautiful sets, and the, I hate to say it, fantastic story, all add up to an impressive film that shows Anderson is a filmmaker capable of doing whatever he wants. Perhaps a black and white, silent film starring only dogs. On second thought that might be right in his wheelhouse. I have to think of a real challenge for him.",10,0,2,10 December 2009
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Let's enjoy this while it lasts
","Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is without a doubt the greatest piece of Star Wars content to be released by a major studio since Return of the Jedi. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best science fiction films to be released in that time frame as well. J.J. Abrams, the creator of Lost and more recently the man who revived an aging Star Trek franchise, outdid himself. Forget all of the hoopla surrounding George Lucas' distaste for the new film. He had his time, and when he was called upon to continue the saga he disappointed the fans. J.J. answered the call and hit a home run.The film starts 30+ years after Return of the Jedi. A new darkness has taken hold of the galaxy in the form of The First Order. The group is picking up right where the Empire left off. It's sole mission: total domination of the galaxy, destroying anyone who stands in their way. Like the Empire, conformity is their model. Standing up to the school yard bully are the familiar rebels, this time in the form of the Resistance, allies to the Republic. I don't want to go too far into the plot as I think it best that you go in as fresh as possible (I was so close to making it!), but I assure you that this new crop of characters are the best since the original trilogy.Abrams introduces us to several characters that within the first few minutes of screen time have more character and range than any and all of the prequel characters. Poe Dameron, Finn, Kylo Ren, Rey, and BB-8 have gone from faces in a movie trailer to household names virtually overnight. My brother said it best that BB-8 has more personality than all of the prequel characters combined, and he's right. These new characters have goals, ambition, emotions we can relate to, AND these characters fit in the Star Wars universe. At the end of the film I was genuinely curious about what would happen to them in the next film.Characters aside, there's a lot to love about this film. My one wish going into the film was to have a fair amount of in camera effects and a plethora of aliens actually walking about. While it's unreasonable to expect there to be a Star Wars film completely void of major CGI characters and effects, boy did Abrams do right in my book. The film is full of great costumes, animatronics, and in camera effects that fans of the original films will get weak at the knees over. It felt like being back in a place with living trees, dry deserts, and frozen plains, not just a green screen with actors wearing sensor suits (though the film is not void of that).So with great characters and living breathing aliens on distant planets, what else does this new film offer that the prequels were lacking? Story. The prequels had a lot of issues in regards to story. Pointless sequences that went on far too long to achieve very little, details that were both boring and disappointing to hear, and the atrocious display of lightsaber fights showcasing stunt choreography instead of the characters emotions. Lightsaber duels were representative of the struggle between two characters. Obi Wan and Darth Vader in A New Hope, and then Luke versus Vader in both Empire and Return. Those fights stood for the struggle against good and evil, an externalization of their feelings. The prequels had double sided sabers, acrobatic Jedis, and the coup de grace of lightsaber atrocities, the spinning quad sabers of General Grievous. This was my main gripe with the prequels, and I was really hoping would be corrected in the new film, and thank the maker it was. Without giving too much away, there is a lightsaber fight in the new film that is possibly the best in the entire series. It's full of emotion and representative of the struggles inside the characters.There is an endless stream of outrage over what was done with the prequels, so I won't go into great lengths. There is one thing that couldn't be helped, regardless of who was writing or directing, and it's something J.J. did not have to deal with. One of the problems the prequels had to deal with is that the audience knows where the films needs to take us for Episode IV. That's the problem any filmmaker faces when making a prequel. Suffice to say J.J. and legendary screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan had virtually free reign about where to take the franchise. This film strikes the perfect balance of acknowledging the original trilogy while not being afraid to take it in a new direction. Upon my second viewing I noticed a few more nods to the original films. They were subtle and didn't take me out of the story.So here we are, entering 2016 with our seventh Star Wars film in the can, and lord knows how many more Star Wars iterations will be released in the coming years. I wouldn't be surprised if in 10 years times we have twice as many films in the Star Wars catalog to talk about. I don't know if that's a good thing, but only time will tell. For the moment, let's take a moment and enjoy what we have. J.J. has given us a wildly entertaining film that will be torn apart, raised up, and talked about for years to come.",9,3,38,6 January 2016
Rear Window," Neighborhood Watch
","Murder is not one of the words that comes to mind when the talking about a neighborhood. A neighborhood is supposed to be a secure, warm, and inviting place that a person can come to after a hard days work and know everything will be alright. In the world of Alfred Hitchcock, it's everything but.Rear Window is the story of L. B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart), a photographer who is currently incapacitated due to a broken leg. He must stay at home and wait until it fully heals to get back out into the world. The only pleasures he has is talking to his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter), spending time with his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), and looking out his window into the courtyard of his apartment complex.Even though Jeffries can be considered a 'peeping Tom', his motives are simply out of boredom and curiosity. All he has are the lives of the other tenants and watching them play out. There is the dancer he dubs Miss Torso. There is also the ever depressing Miss Lonelyheart. The Songwriter and the Newlyweds also live their lives outside Jeffries window. The apartment that particularly catches his attention belongs to that of Lars Thorwald. He suspects that he has killed his wife.All of his accusations are simply based on what he sees, not what he hears. Stella and Lisa both think he is crazy and should stop snooping before it consumes him entirely. Before long he has his friend Detective Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) investigate what is going on over at Thorwald's apartment. The stage is set for a thrill ride through a pair of binoculars.Hitchcock's use of the camera is some of the most creative to date. Almost the entire movie is filmed in Jeffries's apartment. TO make the shots look like what Jeffries is seeing through the binoculars. This same type of shot is used in Roman Polanski's Chinatown. It's an excellent first person perspective. It gives a more realistic quality, like someone could actually be seeing this.Hitchcock also uses a lot of sounds that would be heard in an urban area. The sounds of the street, the other tenants, and what elements of nature remain. The music is used to enhance a shot or a feeling that is trying to be given off.Stewart and Kelly's performances are mirror images of what a couple would be like. They fight, love, and go through the motions of just everyday life. As Stewart's character gets more and more involved with what is going on, so do the other characters. Their mood changes from concerned for Stewart to concerned for Thorwald's wife. This film takes a real setting, real people, in an extraordinary situation. Invasion of a person's privacy working towards the common good is a very peculiar subject to be shown, but Rear Window does it. It's a roller coaster of emotions where the suspense is enough to lift a person out of their seat. Each frame more engaging than the previous. Hitchcock proves that a fascinating story and a little imagination can go a long way.",10,1,3,23 January 2006
The Truman Show," Tru(man)ly remarkable!
","Have you ever thought you were being watched? Like you life was possibly a Television show? Well, Truman Burbank never did and this movie tells of how he found out his life was a TV show.Quite possibly one of the most imaginative plots ever, Peter Weir's The Truman Show shows how one man's vision (Ed Harris) of having someone's life be on TV (that being Truman played by Jim Carey)...without him knowing it. A totally real show that has no boundaries except the walls of the enormous set. With actors playing the roles of the townspeople in this perfect community, as it seems.Jim Carey is brilliant as the confused insurance salesman who just wants the truth about his life. The death of his 'father' drowning at sea has given Truman a reason to stay in his town and not venture off. But the urge to see the woman of his dreams is all to much. She was moved to 'Fiji' because of some problems. Laura Linney plays Truman's wife. She isn't only his wife but is a walking commercial. Whenever there is a product she brings home, it seems like she is telling the world how great it is. Noah Emmerich plays Truman's best friend Marlon. This always uplifting character brings comic relief for Truman when he needs it most. When Truman's world seems to be falling apart, he's there. When Truman just needs a friend, he's there. Marlon is the one part of his life that makes it seem so real when everything else seems so fake.What makes this movie so enjoyable other than the story is how the people act in this 'town'. The way they make sure Truman stays there and doesn't leave. How everybody has a routine and even the weather is controlled. In the opening scene Truman wakes up and heads off to work to have a stage light fall right in the street. Where it came from?...he doesn't know. But doesn't worry about it because life is going great...for now. Ed Harris's character Cristof a.k.a. the Creator is genius and maniacal. With his people working around the clock to make sure all is well, this world he has created is now a world wide phenomenon. He is on top of the world with millions of people watching his creation unfold.This sensational film about a man trying to find his way in the world is incredible. When everything seems like it doesn't add up, it just keeps getting more complicated and giving the viewer one hell of a good movie. The Truman Show is in a league of it's own.",10,26,33,3 July 2005
Casino," Goodfellas in Las Vegas
","When a director makes a fantastic movie, sometimes there will be a follow up movie that has a similar idea and story. This isn't a sequel, but it is pretty much the same movie with a different location and list of characters. This can be done by the same director or a different one. In this case, Martin Scorsese made Goodfellas in 1990, creating one of the greatest movies of all time. In 1995, he came back with another movie of the same caliber as Goodfellas.Casino is the story of the rise and fall of a casino in Las Vegas called the Tangiers during the 1970's and 80's. Casino operator Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and his friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) try to make this casino the best there is while making a huge amount of money for themselves, their wives, and for the 'bosses' back home. They use some interesting methods of persuasion for cheaters in the casino so they never come back, and of course there are payoffs to police, security, politicians, and anyone else who needs to be 'taken care of'. With so much corruption in this town, they fit right in.Sam's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is the woman of his dreams, or at least that's what he thinks. Together, the two of them go on a roller coaster ride through everything. Just when things are looking great, the whole operation falls apart. The Tangiers is running smoothly, no one is ratted out, and they are becoming kings of the Las Vegas strip. Little by little things crumble down into oblivion. Snitches, FBI agents, and all sorts of trouble rain down on this paradise in the desert. Scorsese does a nice job of illustrating the rise and fall of this casino. It is very reminiscent of Goodfellas, the story being the rise and fall of the crime family. Casino the same idea with a different story. The good thing is that there isn't a problem with that because the movie itself makes up for it. Scorsese brings back De Niro and Pesci from previous movies like Raging Bull and Goodfellas to make this movie worth watching. The addition of Sharon Stone, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for her performance as Ginger, gives the movie more of a reason to watch.The only problem with this movie is that is really long, running just short of three hours. Some parts seem to drag on, but with the changing storyline, it's always something new. Scorsese does what he does best and that is tell a great story. His use of narration throughout the whole movie by De Niro and Pesci is very well done. The transition from the 70's to the 80's is noticeable in the equipment used in the casino, the clothing, the music, and the lifestyles they pursue. Whether it's watching the casino floor or taking some guys out back to 'talk' with, there is a lot to watch and be entertained by. The hard work put into running a casino and all of the in's and out's are exposed. It's a hard life out there, but when a problem arises, all they have to to is dig a hole in the desert and let the pistol do the talking. Casino is a great story that is definitely worth a viewing at least once. As the saying goes, 'What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas...'. Thankfully this movie got out for us to see.",7,1,2,29 July 2005
300," Spartan Law
","It is written that 300 Spartan men stood up against a horde of Persian warriors, one of the greatest armies ever assembled. These 300 soldiers fought valiantly and without hesitation to the throng of enemies before them. This would be there finest hour, a period of history that would be glorified for centuries to come. Frank Miller (Sin City), whose graphic novels have won critical acclaim the world over, shares his retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae with us in 300. The story of how few stood against many and changed the course of history and warfare. Director Zack Snyder makes his second film since his remake of the 1978 cult-classic Dawn of the Dead. The year is 480 B.C. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) lead his small band of the bravest and most elite troops in all of Sparta. They all had a wife and children to fight for and carry on their name. They were more than soldiers; they were Spartans. The 'God-King' Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) of Persia was on the war path, snatching up all the land he could. Leonidas would sit back and watch as his people were turned into slaves. They would meet at Thermopylae. Unlike most societies of the day, Spartan's hailed their women and considered them sacred. They believed a true Spartan woman could give birth to a Spartan man. Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is as tough and strong-willed as her husband. She is more than just a wife but a voice. She plans to sway the politicians to send more troops to help fight with her husband. Theron (Dominic West), who has the power of the council in his hand, tries to thwart her plans because he believes what Leonidas is doing is unjust. In the meantime, how about a nice, hardy helping of Spartan brutality? Leonidas and his band of cut, lean warriors fight off wave after wave after wave of Persian assault. Everything from the common foot soldier to elephants armed to the tusk. Masked attackers and monstrous beasts try to take a slice out of the Spartans. Their will is relentless and their feet planted firmly on the ground as their cause for battle.History aside, Frank Miller's interpretation of the event is more or less; gruesome. The battle scenes are epic and not choppy like most action films of today. You don't have to keep guessing who is in what shot or what is exactly going on. The camera is steady and smooth. Swords ablaze and shields shimmering, the Spartans move around the battle with fluid movements as if this were practice for them. The camera zooms in on some shots, emphasizing a slash, chop, or impalement.Speaking of battle scenes, the fight choreography is hard to match anywhere else. Some shots last for several attacks and don't cut away for a moment of the action. There are some one-on-one shots but most have a foreground action and a background action creating this feeling of being in ancient Greece. Another important thing to mention: this movie is not for the faint of heart. 300 goes beyond hack and slash. Limbs, heads, and gallons of blood cover the field of battle. Spartans show no mercy.Like his previous work on the big screen, Sin City used a lot of harsh lighting and dark shadows to present a certain mood. 300 has a lot of earth tones; dark, dull, and aged colors. Certain colors stand out like the red robes the Spartan soldiers wear and the golden chains Xerxes wraps himself in.If any other film had speeches as uplifting and energized as this does, I would probably laugh. After listening to Leonidas talk of honor, glory, and death in battle, I myself wanted to take up arms with him. The dialogue isn't mesmerizing but it certainly does the job.300 is not your typical film. Do not call it a comic book movie (because a graphic novel is completely different) or a war drama. 300 is unique and has redefined the graphic novel genre. It is technically and visually brilliant. Don't take the kids to see this one. Prepare yourselves for an awesome spectacle of valor, courage, and chiseled abs. To Victory!",8,2,6,11 March 2007
Apollo 13," Survival Story turned Cinema Gold
","In April of 1970, three men were sent into space to walk on the moon. Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert are true survivalists of what could have been a complete disaster. They would be the infamous crew of the Apollo 13 space mission.In Ron Howard's 1995 release of Apollo 13, Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon play the crew that would be launched from Cape Canaveral and into history. The flight that went wrong and had Lovell (Hanks) utter those famous words, 'Houston, we have a problem'. When a routine task aboard their ship goes horribly wrong, these three men are thrown into a life or death situation.In the shadow of the 1969 lunar landing, the first ever, these men were nobodies to the general public, until 'it' happened. With media flocking the Lovell's home, wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) must muster up all the courage she has and make sure her family keeps it together. She and the whole world waits for the three men to return home safely.Flight director Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) also has the difficult job of finding a way for these boys to come home. He and his team of experts work around the clock for nearly a week to ensure the safe return of the crew. Every time something seems to be going right, there is another problem. CO2 levels run high, exhaustion, power, and the troubled heat shield are all problems the crew at Houston the crew thousands of miles above Houston confront.With so much stress and a problem arising every other minute, tension grows on board with the crew. The fact that Jack (Bacon) is replacing what would have been Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) makes the other crew members a little cautious of his skills and his performance levels. They trusted Ken, but Jack is new and since he performed the task the caused the problem, they are very suspicious of him. The men must keep it together if they went to get home in one piece.This movie shows true courage in one of the worst space accidents the world has ever seen. Howard does a great job of preserving this unbelievable story of bravery and survival. So many times movies about something that actually happened get caught up in computer graphics or try to hard to appeal to everyone when this movie uses better acting, directing, and does have good computer effects as a bonus. This movie lifts off the ground and clears the tower.",10,0,2,4 July 2005
The Thin Red Line," The Battle Within
","It is hard to imagine for those who were not there the emotions that were felt during combat in World War II. The harsh realities of going form civilian life to dodging bullets, hiding in abandoned buildings, and ambushing your enemy while they are waking up are difficult to grab hold of. The times have changed, but the attitude towards what these brave soldiers went through has not. What really happened lies only in the minds of those who were on the battle field, not in a history book or some television special. Director Terrence Malick hopes to change your view on the men and who gave their lives so we might live ours in peace.Malick's intense war epic The Thin Red Line is a look into what the men were thinking about during and after the blood was shed. It is the behind the scenes look of the American and Allied forces in the Pacific Campaign. The film opens with Private Witt (James Caviezel) enjoying his 'vacation' from the military, living amongst the islanders of the pacific. Before the military finds that he is AWOL, Witt enjoys living in a society where war is nonexistent and peace is everyday life. His life is quickly going to be changed when Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn) finds him and brings him back to his 'family'.The Battle of Guadalcanal was a brutal campaign. The men weren't getting the supplies they needed and the enemy had the advantage of the territory. With the anger of missing home, wanting to win, and sheer courage, the American's pushed through. The struggle of officers with one another is evident with Lt. Col. Tall (Nick Nolte) who wants to run the show and make sure credit is given where it is due. Pressure from above forces him to push his troops to the limit and overcome the Japanese forces.What Malick incorporates into this story alongside the war aspect is the ripple effect the war has on the surrounding area. Machine gun fire tears through the jungle. Wildlife is forced to adapt to the intruders. The camera is almost an observer, neutral to the outcome of the war, just overseeing the devastation this war is having on everything. At one point Witt returns to the tribe he had come to love and become a part of only to find that hate and fear had entered the village. A settlement void of struggle now is engulfed in it.With not as much dialogue as most war movies, The Thin Red Line relies on voice over to convey the characters feelings motives. There is the usual war language, but during the times of rest or searching, the soldiers reflect on memories past, friends and family left behind, and what is going to happen next. What seems to be a talking journal to go along with the film, the audience can really get in touch with what the soldiers are going through. Not being able to feel remorse for fallen comrades and enemies is considered 'bliss' for Sgt. Welsh. The reality of seeing you friends who you have been together with for months and seeing them shot in half is all too emotional to comprehend.Where The Thin Red Line prevails where other war movies don't is the connection made with the soldiers. Other films like Saving Private Ryan, although epic and stunning in its own respect, rely on the war itself and not the war within the men. Granted, the war was terrible and should not be forgotten, the struggle the men went through and what their families endured is paramount.",9,3,7,8 May 2006
Fantastic Four," Comic Book Fans...UNITE!!!
","Marvel Comics have been shelling out the comic book based movies for a while now. Spiderman, The Hulk, The Punisher, all have been transformed from paper to film. Their latest selection is the Fantastic Four.Director Tim Story (Taxi, Barber Shop) has taken on this project of making Marvel's classic comic book, Fantastic Four. The story starts with Prof. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) go to talk with Reed's old friend Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) about his Doom's helping Reed's project. His idea is to study the affects of cosmic radiation on DNA in space. Sue Storm and her brother Johnny (Jessica Alba and Chris Evans) are also on the mission into space.Due to a freak occurrence, radiation mutates the five's DNA while in space. Each now possessing their own unique power. Reed can bend his body like rubber with little effort. He is Mr. Fantastic. Johnny's body temperature is incredibly high and he can create fire and even light himself on fire. Johnny also can fly. He is the Human Torch. His sister Sue can become invisible and also create force fields for keeping things in or out around her. Sue is the Inivisible Woman. Ben is now The Thing. He is totally covered in solid rock...inside and outside. He also has incredible strength. He cannot turn his power off like the others. Lastly, Doom, like Ben, is totally covered with an element. This time it is a super hard metal. He also can absorb and use electricity. Doom goes the way of the villain while the other four join forces to figure out what happened.The movie is very much like a comic book. The dialogue between characters is written to sound like a comic book. Johnny, the hot headed character (literally), brings comedy with his quick witty remarks. Ben brings drama with his depression of losing his wife due to his mutation. The contrast between these two characters is fun to watch. Johnny is always trying to get under his skin. Even though he is solid rock, it's not hard to do. He has the hardest time adapting. With a relationship in the past for Reed and Sue, they have their own little story as well, just like a comic book. Doom, being the rich bad guy, wants nothing more than more power.Although the script gets cheesy at times, it works. There isn't as much action as I had anticipated, but when there is, there is a lot of it. Great effects make Fantastic Four an enjoyable movie for fans of the comic book, children, and adults as well. Fantastic Four is a good movie for the genre. Ben says to Sue, 'You have no idea what I'd give to be invisible...', but I'm sure that is not the case for the movie. I'm sure a lot of people will see this one.",7,10,17,8 July 2005
The Great Escape," Tunneling at it's Finest
","Who hasn't been caught whistling the theme song from The Great Escape? I know I have. It's one of the many great qualities to the movie. Along with the catchy song, there is a gripping plot, a great cast, and everything put together makes for one memorable movie.Our story starts as new POW's, American and British, enter a new Nazi POW camp. The new 'campers' include Roger Bartlett (Sir Richard Attenborough) or the 'Big X', Bob Hendley (James Garner) 'The Scrounger', and of course Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) 'The Cooler'. Along with others like Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Donald Pleasance, a group of about 250 men are determined to escape this Nazi hell hole.An intricate system of signals and distractions keep the goons off of their backs. The plan is to tunnel out of the camp into the nearby wooded area. From their they will disguise themselves are German citizens and make their way back to their respective countries. This will require clothing, paperwork, acting, and other supplies needed to blend in and look normal to a German Officer outside of the camp.This true story of how soldier's tried to outsmart the German's is one that is fascinating and amusing. The little things like hiding supplies, the tunnels, and the immense amount of dirt is incredible and quite ingenious. Imagine trying to tunnel deep enough underground so no one knows what you're doing and keeping it undercover. Not to mention sneaking 250 people out at once. It's quite a challenge.This war drama is one of the best of it's era and genre of all time. What sets this movie apart from the rest is a riveting story added with some Hollywood magic to bring it back to life. Although some parts of the movie are stretched from the truth, it still tells a true story in an entertaining fashion.Director John Sturges does the story of the 'Great Escape' a lot of justice, showing it to a wide variety of people. The Great Escape is timeless!",10,8,15,4 July 2005
Jackie Brown," Jackie Brown is another Tarantino classic!
","Quentin Tarantino has written and directed some of the best movies in the last 25 years, starting with Reservoir Dogs and all the way up through the Kill Bill movies. Each of his films has a distinctive quality about it, whether it's the violence or the harsh language, but the thing everyone remembers most is the dialogue between characters.In Jackie Brown, Tarantino takes us for a ride as we follow Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), a flight attendant helping an arms dealer named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) get money where it needs to be. After a flight, she is pull aside by two cops, one being Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton), who find the cash she is smuggling in for Ordell. Now she faces jail time and Ordell must get rid of somebody who might snitch. What happens now is the bail bondsman Max Cherry(Robert Forster) and Brown team up to mess with Ordell and his two pot smoking companions, Melanie (Bridget Fonda) and Louis Gara (Robert De Niro). Now it's a nice plot of how Ordell wants the half a million dollars he has coming to him with these arms deals and how Jackie Brown is the only connection between Ordell and the police and Cherry.Tarantino once again delivers the goods with this film. The movie starts off with a great dialogue between Jackson and De Niro about guns. The rest of the movie is very entertaining. Whenever Grier and Jackson talk, it's a good scene because the two have no idea what the other is about to do to the other one. They are both a little stressed out over the fact that the money isn't in the right place and are trying their best not to get each other pinched.This movie received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Forster) and many good reviews. Forster isn't the only one giving a great performance. De Niro, Fonda, Jackson, Grier, Keaton, even Chris Tucker who is in the movie for probably less than five or ten minutes gives a notable performance.The whole ensemble is incredibly well casted and deserves to be recognized.Jackie Brown is vintage Tarantino. This film is over shadowed by his other giants (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2), but still is a great film. Tarantino is one of the best writers of recent cinema and this piece shines. Another great script from Tarantino, a fun plot, and an incredible cast give this movie something to be proud of. Quentin always delivers the goods, and this sure lives up to that. Jackie Brown is a great film, and don't you forget it!",8,1,3,1 August 2005
Sin City," Courageous, Smart, and a Hell of a Good Time
","Before I saw this movie I had never heard of Frank Miller's Sin City and after the first time I saw it I am a fan. The characters grabbed me with their sleek way of going around town their dialogue...OH THE DIALOGUE!!!It is read just like a comic book. It's perfect! The combination of narrating and actually speaking to one another flows beautifully. The three stories intertwine slightly and leave nothing behind. The three characters in focus are Hartigan, Marv, and Dwight played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen respectively. The three men have run ins with others notables like Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Elijah Wood, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and many more. All with qualities that define themselves, just like a comic book or graphic novel character in this case.The color choices are interesting. The majority of the movie is filmed in black and white, but certain items or features are colored in. Marv's pills are in color, as is the sky at one point when it becomes blood red. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez did the stories justice.What makes this movie stand out ahead of all other comic book movies is the fact that it is set up like a comic book. The way the characters seem invincible and don't fear anything except to fail in their quest. These guys aren't super heroes either. They are just some of the people of Basin City, a town where anything goes...for a small price.With so many memorable characters and lines from this movie, there is no telling how much of an impact it will make. Hopefully sequels will come with new plots and characters with just as many great speeches and narratives.'An old man dies, a young girl lives... a fair trade...I love you, Nancy...'",10,2,4,1 July 2005
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day Lewis is Robbed of an Oscar
","The scene is set as two groups stare across an intersection in the mid 1800's. On one side is the Irish, led by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). The 'Natives' as they like to be called stand opposite them with their leader Bill 'The Butcher' (Daniel Day Lewis). Each side holding a wide variety of 'cut em up' weapons. Everything from clubs to machetes are present. The battle is just beginning.Martin Scorsese's film Gangs of New York depicts the early years of New York City and the Irish immigration, specifically in an area called the Five Points. The 'natives' as they so liked to be called, who's ancestors have lived there for many years, despise the Irish. They feel like it's not an immigration, but an invasion. An invasion of there land.The Irish don't like the welcome they have received from these so called 'natives'. They as Priest Vallon puts it, 'Plauge our people...'. The son of Priest Vallon is Amsterdam played by Leonardo DiCaprio. As he grows up, Amsterdam hates the natives and most of all, 'The Butcher' for what he has done.What makes this movie stand out is the acting, most memorable is that of Daniel Day Lewis as the horrible, merciless, and down right nasty Bill 'The Butcher'. Bill oversees everything that goes on in the Five Points. 'Mulberry Street... and Worth... Cross and Orange... and Little Water. Each of the Five Points is a finger. When I close my hand it becomes a fist. And, if I wish, I can turn it against you,' is what he says to Boss Tweed, just a politician trying to get in on the action of the Five Points.Lewis's character is one that is both respected and feared by everyone in the Points. His sometimes violent behavior brings pain and suffering to those on the other end. All kneel to Bill, even Amsterdam who befriends him.The great thing about this movie is that you can see it over and over again and still find something interesting about it. Whether it be the actual historic value it shares, or the bloodshed and violence that rivals that of Braveheart. It's a shame that this movie won nothing at the academy awards with 10 nominations. Daniel Day Lewis especially was robbed by Adrian Brody (The Pianist). Movies like Chicago, The Hours, and The Pianist beat it out. But still, this movie will have longevity and become a classic.",10,1,2,2 July 2005
Moon," The dark side of the moon
","When I think of the word moon I don't just think of our moon, the Moon, but a distant body floating along, slightly disconnected but close enough for contact. That is more what Duncan Jones' debut film Moon is about.It stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, the one man crew of Lunar Industries energy base located on, you guessed it, the Moon. He is alone with the station's computer/robot Gerty (voiced marvelously by Kevin Spacey) for three years and is only two weeks away from his return trip home. He has a wife and child he has yet to hold back on Earth. Everything seems to be going well.Then it happens. An accident while checking one of the harvesters. He wakes up back in the base and is bombarded with tests by the computer. His memory of the incident is gone and all that he knows is there has been an accident and he is not allowed back outside. He is determined to get outside.What happens next I don't want to get into. Watch the trailer to try and get an idea for yourself. What ensues, at least to me, is one of the best psychological science fiction stories of all time. It asks so many questions about what is right and wrong, the value of one's life, and how far is too far for science to go. This film shows what happens when a man is pushed to the limit in a place where the limit is very confined.This is Rockwell's defining moment as an actor. His characters up until this point have been surprisingly good (especially in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), but this is the one. You can read his face and know exactly what he is feeling. There were times when I wanted to tell him everything will be alright, even though I wasn't sure. I can only imagine what three years in virtual isolation can feel like.The real winner here is Duncan and his spectacular approach to this genre. He uses very recognizable technologies tied in with futuristic advancements that are a stretch, but not by much. From a visual standpoint you will be hard pressed to find a more realistic looking sci/fi film. I'm guessing he used a combination of green screen, models, and some CGI to create such a realistic lunar landscape. It gives the story an added boost.From start to finish this is an impressive film from both a technical standpoint and a stylistic one. Moon is that rare piece of science fiction that tinkers with the way you look at the world we live in and not just the future. There is a good amount of deep thinking that can be dredged up from watching this film. Some people might find that annoying. I think that is what makes film so enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie before it leaves the theaters. Waiting for this one to be released would be a mistake.",10,3,5,19 July 2009
Her," There doesn't seem to be anyone around
","Spike Jonze's latest feature film Her tackles the subject of being alone. Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore Twombly, a man separated from his wife who spends most of his time working, checking emails, playing video games, and talking to his computer. He is not the only person partaking in this ritual. The majority of the characters and extras in the film are talking to their ear pieces and interacting with their computers, or OS (operating system). Things change when OS-1 comes out, introducing the world's first artificially intelligent OS. Shortly thereafter we are introduced to Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johnansson). This first encounter will forever change Theodore's life.What is so wonderful about Her is the world that Spike creates. It's a world exactly like ours. The key for me is how nonchalantly his characters use their tech. People walk around with tech sticking out of their ears, talking to themselves, and going about their business completely oblivious to what's happening around them. We have, 'interactions,' and, 'connections,' with other people through our devices. We walk past strangers who are using the same tech and having the same experience. We rely so much on these devices to go through day to day living.Spike ingeniously takes this obsession with tech and gives it a personality. Instead of talking to Siri about a new email, listening to music, or taking a picture (because you may never see a sunset again!!!), Theodore partakes in all of these rituals with Samantha. So he's not just listening to music. He's listening to a song Samantha picked out (or composed) just for him. He's not just taking a picture of a sunset. Instead he and Samantha can experience it with him. They converse about what they're doing instead of just mulling about aimlessly.By giving the tech a personality and the ability to think, it makes the experience of being alone not so lonely. Theodore and Samantha overcome many obstacles in their relationship, the first being that Samantha isn't just an OS. Samantha is, well, Samantha. A free thinking, super inquisitive mind that has wants and needs and can be happy and afraid all at once. It's brilliant how the outside world views their relationship. In short, it's perfectly okay to have this relationship. Not everyone agrees and those people who are hesitant cause some doubt to creep into Theodore's head, but don't all new technologies have people that oppose its use? Let's face it, 10 or 15 years ago the idea of meeting a person online seemed pretty ridiculous. Nowadays not only is it acceptable, it's become a primary alternative to meeting someone new.This near tangible relationship with a non tangible being is, at first glance, odd. There is a scene where Theodore can't find Samantha. His connection to the server isn't going through. He frantically searches for connectivity, like a parent looking for a lost child at Disney. We don't look at this as crazy. We can sympathize because we do the same thing, like when we search for free wifi or that elusive 4G bar we desperately need for a phone call. Heaven help us if for one minute we can't receive an update or check our email, for the alternative is...alone time...The inability to spend time by ourselves could be brought on by the pace at which we live our lives. Faster, stronger, newer, and bigger. Think of how long it took mankind to develop boats, then trains, planes, and rocket ships. Now think about how quickly we move today, both in physical and mental space. We are constantly, 'progressing,' because our technology allows us to do so. So when we have a lull in activity, our minds start to wander, and that is not natural for today's standards. When Theodore can't connect to the server, he is left alone, and the thought of being alone scares the hell out of him.In the end that's what Theodore is looking for. In a way so is Samantha. We are constantly looking for distractions and a companion so we don't have to be alone. No matter how many friends, likes, retweets, pins, or subscribers we have, there is always that fear of being alone. I know this doesn't necessarily include everyone. There are people, fully functioning people, who don't require these needs, but for the most part, we can all agree that our world will never be the same because of our technology.The connections that matter most are not the ones made by circuits, microchips, and displays. They are made with each other. They are made by communicating face to face. They are made with our senses. They are made with our memories. Spike could have taken this film is a variety of directions, and the one he chose couldn't have made me happier. You should experience it on your own. You just might learn something about yourself.Tonight when I take the train home, I'll throw on my ear buds and play melancholy music, just like Theodore Twombly. I'll flick through my news feed or maybe take an Instagram of a cool angle on the railway. Or maybe I'll just sit there instead. I'll let my mind wander, drifting in and out of rational and irrational thought. I could revisit a memory or plan out what to eat for dinner.With my iPhone, only so much is possible. With me, anything is possible.",10,0,2,26 March 2014
The Breakfast Club," Essential
","In John Hughes' classic 80's film The Breakfast Club, five people from five different clicks of the high school realm are forced to sit together for one Saturday due to their reckless behavior. The group consisting of, 'a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal,' learn what it is like living in their shoes.The brain is Anthony Michael Hall and his character Brian is one of the more complex. He needs to keep his grades up so he can survive his home life. All seems fine in his world but little does the Breakfast Club know it is anything but.Andy is the athlete played by Emilio Estevez, is the person who always can fight his way out of a situation. If something needs to get done, he can do it. This pressure is poured onto him by his father. The wrestling team needs him and this Saturday session is the key to continuing his quest for college.Ally Sheedy plays the part of the basket case named Allison. She is the oddball of the group. With her secretive, quiet, and sometimes disturbing attitude, she is the one who must truly find out what she really is and what she wants out of life.The princess is played by Molly Ringwald. Claire is so self absorbed that even if she became friends with someone there she wouldn't tell anyone because it would ruin her reputation of being perfect and popular.Last but not least is the criminal played by Judd Nelson. As the smart-ass of the 'club', John Bender (just called Bender) feels like he runs the show. Always nipping back at Principal Vernon (Paul Gleason) who runs this Saturday detention. Nelson delivers a mind blowing performance as this trash talking, punk dressing, and domestically abused teenager.Director John Hughes could not miss with any of his pictures in the 80's. Sixteen Candles, Ferris Buehler's Day Off, PLanes, Trains, and Automobiles, and Uncle Buck. All done within 5 years. All are priceless. This picture stands out among them.What makes this movie so memorable is the dialogue shared between these characters. They would have never met if it wasn't for this detention on a Saturday. They never would have shared so many deep, intimate thoughts that otherwise might have stayed locked up in 'the vault'. Each person tells their story of where they come from and why they are there giving us a feeling of relief in the end.With all the pieces put together, you get one hell of a movie and one that will be remembered for generations to come. Who could ever forget Claire's lipstick trick?",9,0,1,2 July 2005
The Social Network," Not everything is private
","In The Social Network, we follow Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a sophomore at Harvard University who is looking for a way to make his mark on campus, but more importantly to get himself into one of the elite Final Clubs at the prestigious institution, but that is easier said than done. After creating a website that allows users to rate how 'hot' a female is compared to another, he turns the heads of some of the club members. Two in particular approach him in regards to an idea they had about social networking for Harvard. Mark agrees to help, but along the way realizes that this idea is much bigger than they all realize. Thus, Facebook is conceived.Mark's aim is to put the social experience of college online. With the help of his good friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and his computer programming friends, they make a model for what will eventually be the most popular site this side of Google. As the project gets bigger and bigger, the network needs to evolve in order to stay alive. Enter Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the man who created Napster. Sean shows Mark the possibilities of his website, while Eduardo is looking to make money instantly. Mark, who clearly doesn't see eye to eye with Eduardo, decides to move on without him, creating a divide between the two that would never be repaired.The film is cut up between the story and development of Facebook, and the lawsuits that Mark found himself in following his massive success, one suit coming from the Harvard club members who claim Mark stole their idea, and the other from Eduardo, who accuses Mark of cutting him out of Facebook unfairly.The movie revolves around the character and motives of Mark. Jesse Eisenberg gives a career defining performance, really embracing the role and giving it everything he has. His dialogue is so snappy, making him sound so smart, clear, and ready for anything. The writing by Sorkin is outstanding. He doesn't wander about the story. He gets right to the point, highlighting the major incidents that occurred during the early days of this Internet phenomenon.The supporting cast around Eisenberg couldn't have been better. Garfield as Mark's friend has great presence on screen, much like Timberlake who surprised me with his somewhat straightforwardness about Parker. It was clear that he was trying to play the character, not like his over the top performances from SNL. He is doesn't steal the show, and he doesn't have to. What I like so much about the casting is how nobody has really proved themselves before on the big screen. Timberlake is a superstar, but hasn't proved until now that he can handle a serious role. Eisenberg and Garfield are just starting to get their feet wet and the rest of the cast is for the most part unknown or in the same boat. It's because of this that we accept them as the characters they play, instead of watching someone like Seth Rogen. I was able to watch this movie and just focus on the story, not who was up there.When I first heard that Eisenberg and Timberlake were slated to star in this film, I was a little uneasy. When I heard David Fincher was directing, I thought it was a joke. How could someone like this direct a movie with two actors who primarily do comedy (or music videos for JT's sake)? After watching the trailer, I was bought into it. This has Fincher written all over it. Like his other films (Fight Club, Se7en, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), this has a dark, sometimes grimy look to it, like a cloudy film was placed over the camera lens, creating a dingy, often muted look. It compliments the old fashioned campus of Harvard perfectly, and also creates a much needed dramatic tone. If this were shot with bright, popping colors, it would be a confusing film. With the help of Sorkin's script, Fincher creates a fast paced drama that really opens our eyes to the world around us.What this film does an excellent job of is instead of focusing on college and it's rules and regulations, we focus on the impact of this website on all scales, from campus to global. We see that the power one website can have is astounding, but more importantly how rapid an idea can surface, be put into production, and impact the world.For those who aren't familiar with Facebook, this is still a movie you can enjoy. This isn't a love ballad for the now multi-billion dollar company, but it's an examination of what happens when friendship meets business, when desire becomes creation, when innovation turns into a nightmare.By the end of the film we don't know what exactly to make of Mark Zuckerberg. Granted this film isn't totally accurate, but it's clear that this is a man who knows what he wants, and understands the risks of acquiring it.There are a lot of things to like about this movie, and not too many things to hate. I would undoubtedly expect great things to come from this film during the award season. It rules on all fronts; acting, directing, writing, cinematography, production design, music. This one has it all. The one thing I hope doesn't come as a result of this movie is 'The Twit Flick.' Let's keep it to one social networking film for now.",10,2,5,1 October 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," Why not?
","In life, there are certain moments that when you look back on them a smile plays around your lips. For Chris Gardner, looking back at 1981 will bring a smile and a tear.The Pursuit of Happiness stars Will Smith in his most sincere and serious role since 2001's Ali. Here we find Smith as Chris Gardner, an out of luck salesman who is desperately trying to support for his son Christopher, played by his real life son Jaden Smith, and his over worked wife Linda (Thandie Newton).One day while on his way to try and persuade some doctors to buy a portable bone density scanner, Chris runs into a well-to-do stock broker who seems to have it all. The car, the job, and the happiness Chris is searching for. From that moment on, his determination cranks up higher than ever to try and land a job as a stock broker.All the while Linda is slaving at work while trying to deal with their debt and her husbands failing sales career. Fed up with his far out dreams, she needs to get closer to reality by leaving all of this behind and starting a new in New York City, even if it means leaving behind the husband she once loved and the son she can't care for. Chris and Christopher now must fend for themselves against the harshness that is life.Italian director Gabriele Muccino had not directed a movie in the states previous to Happiness. With the help of writer Steve Conrad (The Weather Man), the film was pointed in the right direction. Inspired by a true story, there is no better person to fit the shoes of Chris Gardner than Smith, someone who is not shy on letting his emotions spill out onto the film.First timer Jaden Smith is a blessing for the film. One of the main characters, Jaden had to take on a demanding role, at times emotionally stressful. I'm sure having his papa there was a big help. The two have the perfect on screen chemistry that is intense, memorable, and down to earth. There is a definite bond, for obvious reasons, and it shows on screen.Although the story is one that is not so foreign, it is still uplifting. Like last years Cinderella Man, Happiness takes on the 'underdog' genre cleverly and passionately. It is a heart melting tale of one man trying to survive in an urban jungle that is just waiting for the cards to fall in his favor for once. Certainly there are a handful a year that aim at pushing this message of 'never give up' and 'keep on dreaming'. Some just don't quite succeed be it the acting or a weak and over used story. Happiness fits the mold, not breaking it, but certainly filling it to the brim.Happiness works on an emotional level. Smith carries the picture from beginning to end. Never once breaking character or going over the top. You won't find groundbreaking filming techniques, but that's not to say that the film doesn't look nice. The music too goes right along with the story, seemingly bringing out the emotions of the characters.In a world where people can be so cold and so harsh, there are those who survive and thrive amongst us. Not everyone has there life story told on film. Some with the most incredible stories go unnoticed. But there are those that don't and these are the stories that inspire and keep us believing in ourselves. This film, this story, answers the question, 'Why not?'",7,0,2,17 December 2006
Cinderella Man," Hope of a Nation
","Boxing movies have been around for a while. The Rocky collection of movies really kicked things off for the genre. Raging Bull came after and Ali followed suit. All have great stories and show what it means to be a contender. Each has they're own style that works. Ali had intense fighting scenes and Rocky utilized the montage to perfection. Director Ron Howard has expanded on the genre again.Howard's Cinderella Man starring Russell Crowe as the boxer Jimmy Braddock is one of his best films so far. With great acting and a story that really hits home, movie goers will not be disappointed. Crowe's performance is breathtaking as the working man's fighter. His Jersey accent and presence on screen is astounding. His acting is complemented with his leading lady Mae played by Renee Zellweger. The chemistry between these two shows real compassion during what is one of the darkest times in US history, the Great Depression.Braddock is trying to find work and a fight with the help of his trainer Joe Gould, played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti. Gould isn't a rich man but he doesn't do too badly either. He supports Braddock whenever he is in trouble. He gives him a knock about something else to take his mind off of something troubling. These two men will ultimately be apart of one of them most inspiring and compelling stories in all of sports. of Braddock's rise back to the top has left its mark on the boxing world forever.Along with great acting comes great film making. The cinematography especially, during the fights, is extremely realistic. Sometimes it feels like the audience is taking the punches. Outside the ring Howard uses a lot of symbolism to convey the feelings and emotions only those who lived through the Great Depression could feel. Stealing wood from a fence just to heat your home is one of the desperate measures taken by the Braddock family.The score is impressive as well. Thomas Newman (Road to Perdition) mixes period music with the music Newman composed for the movie, depending on the situation, to emphasize the emotion Howard tries to pass onto the audience.What Howard creates isn't just a boxing movie. He paints a portrait of a man who is feared by bigger, stronger men and loved by people of all creeds and upbringings. Jim Braddock is a great person to look up to for inspiration and with the world the way it is, everyone can use a hero. That's what made Braddock so likable. He struggled to support his family during the Great Depression, just like everyone else. He fought not only for his family and his dignity, but for every hard worker out there. They wanted they're man to win. Howard, along with the great cast, have brought a legend back to life.",9,0,0,30 June 2005
The Simpsons Movie," It's a hell of a town!
","The Simpsons have broken records, broken boundaries, and have kept us laughing for close to two decades. It paved the way for animated programming geared towards an older audience. Without The Simpsons, there would be no South Park, no Family Guy, and the word 'D'oh!' would not have been entered into the Oxford English Dicionary.In that span of time they have had a slew of awards, video games, board games, fan clubs, clothing, but never a movie. It took Matt Groening and his team of creators 18 years and nearly four hundred episodes before The Simpsons Movie lit up the theatre marquee.Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and all of the citizens of Springfield, USA have taken the big screen by storm and in a big way. We find America's favorite dysfunctional family in the midst of an environmental crisis. The town lake is being polluted to the brink of ecological collapse. Only if the town bands together will the problem be solved.Of course, it doesn't work out. Homer inevitably puts the entire town at risk of total destruction and the EPA along with President Schwartzenegger must come in and solve the problem so as to not disturb the rest of the country. The usual 'Simpsonian' plot ensues where Homer thinks he does the right thing but actually doesn't. Bart loses faith in Homer and looks for guidance elsewhere. Lisa has fallen in love with someone who fights for what she believes in. Maggie sucks her pacifier. Marge must bring everyone back to reality so the family can save the day.So what is the big deal? Other than the fact that it is the first Simpsons movie, the story is decent enough and entertaining enough to sit down and enjoy. It doesn't go on too long and the writing is really funny. It seems that the writing staff really took there time on this project, seeing as they didn't have to do it for next Sunday's FOX lineup. The jokes are timed perfectly and the material is fresh.One thing that I was afraid of was that the film would be overrun with cameo appearances seeing as it would be cool to do a voice in The Simpsons Movie. Fortunately, there are only a few, and those few are well placed and well executed.Whether or not there will be another Simpsons movie or not, who knows. There are some elements of the film that make it seem like this would more than likely be the end of the series, but what will life be like without the Simpsons? They can't just live in syndication and DVD sets, can they? That day will ultimately come, but it doesn't have to be right now.The Simpsons Movie puts the charge back into the series. From start to finish, it's a heck of a good time. You'll laugh until you cry. Besides, how can a movie with Spider-Pig be bad?",7,3,8,26 July 2007
The Fighter," You are Micky Ward
","In David O. Russell's The Fighter, we are given a glimpse at the life of Micky 'Irish' Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and his climb into the world of boxing. Micky, the brother of Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), a former boxer whose claim to fame being his knockdown of 'Sugar' Ray Leonard. Dicky trains Micky in their home town of Lowell, Massachusetts, under the management of their mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo). Micky is looking to get his fair shot at legitimate fighters, only his mother's managing skills go so far, landing him in smaller matches, and sometimes getting out matched. Micky's window is closing.His brother Dicky, whose life has gone nowhere since his bout with Leonard, wanders off away from the gym, to one of Lowell's many crack houses. His love of boxing and family is only outweighed by his drug addiction. Micky's family matters outside the ring are killing him in the ring. He finds confidence in his new girlfriend, college drop-out Charlene (Amy Adams), a brazen, young vixen who is not willing to let Micky squander his gifts in the ring for a family he can't rely on.This aptly named film is not just about boxing, let alone just about Micky Ward. It's about fighting to survive, fighting for love, for honor, and family. This is a film about the bond between brothers, between mothers and sons, husbands and wives, boxers and trainers. There are so many levels and ways to look at this film. Micky's struggles to achieve in the ring, Dicky's struggles with drug addiction, the list goes on.One thing that is clearly evident here is the painstaking attention to detail that Russell takes in creating the world that Micky Ward boxed in. Filming at the very same gym Micky trained at, using the same cameras and crews that HBO Boxing used to film Micky's fights, and even casting one of Micky's trainers Mickey O'Keefe to play himself. It reminded me of Gus van Sant's Milk where van Sant used many shots from the documentary The Times of Harvey Milk and other television segments to recreate the feel and especially the look of Harvey Milk's San Francisco. Russell takes it even further with Dicky's life and includes the HBO documentary made featuring Dicky in the early 90s. (I won't give the title, but you can view it on snagfilms.com)To back up this realism you need real, raw performances from the entire cast. For me, the success of the film lies on Wahlberg, without his commitment to the physical component of Micky's character and also his personality, the film would fail. He is supported by an incredibly cast, all of which give Oscar worthy performances, especially Bale. Bale's transformation into a wandering, drug addicted delinquent is something to see. His uneasiness on camera fits his character so well.The two supporting females both surprised me from the start. I knew of Leo from Frozen River, an indie darling two years back garnering her an Oscar nod. Adams I had known from several films, including one of my favorites of two years back, Doubt. They both take off the gloves and get real dirty for this one. Leo looks like the poster child for 90s hairdos while Adams thick, nasty accent comes straight from the North Shore of Mass. Watching the two go at it on screen is fantastic. They really hit their marks.At the end of the film we are shown a glimpse of the real Micky Ward and Dicky Eklund, following the shooting of the film. As if we needed more of a reason to love their performances, here we see exactly where Wahlberg and Bale drew their inspiration from. Their acting is spot on, another tribute to their devotion to the film.",9,2,4,4 January 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," Butler brings down the system
","It stars Butler as Clyde Shelton, a man who survives a home invasion only to lose his wife and daughter in the attack. When his attorney Nick Rice, played by Jamie Foxx, decides to make a plea bargain due to some questionable evidence, Butler is completely destroyed. The man who killed his family gets a 3-5 year stretch while his accomplice who didn't do the killing gets a death sentence.Flash forward ten years and the man sentenced to death finally meets his fate, only during his lethal injection something goes wrong, and what is normally a painless death turns into an excruciating and incredibly violence execution. Suspects are pursued, including the man who got the lighter sentence. When he runs he winds up in Shelton's hands. Shelton has big plans for bringing down the system that left him by the wayside.One of the trends with thrillers lately has been the idea that one man or group is killing people without being there, much like the Saw movies. The idea that a person is so intelligent that they can not only kill without being there, but also predict what other outside forces will do to interfere. It's a scary idea, and a fun one to watch unfold on screen.As far as story goes this one is somewhat predictable. Although we want Butler's character to have his revenge, the things he does we cannot support, making Foxx the unlikable and likable hero. In order for us to like him he has to learn a lesson, such is the purpose of these killers. Like the Saw movies and even David Fincher's Se7en, the heroes are meant to learn something or realize what they are doing and who they really are/should be.As I said earlier, Butler does a surprisingly good job here for a film of this caliber. It's not a fantastic performance, but his delivery is just right for his character and the story. Foxx does an adequate job in playing the inquisitive attorney and the supporting cast fills in nicely. The action and the suspense is the driving force of this film, but it's nice to have something else to like.The film is entertaining, doing just what it needs to do. It doesn't go too far to try and wow you with a story. Sometimes movies like that fall flat on their face, like Gothika. I try to limit myself to a small amount of films like this as they tend to copy one another and offer very little except a tired, old storyline with star power thrown in to try and boost up the box office count. I think most people will enjoy this, though there is some nasty violence at times. Still enjoyable.",7,0,2,23 October 2009
High Fidelity," The Perfect Comedy
","Music and movies are like white on rice. It's the perfect blend of sight and sound that can make or break a film. Even when sound wasn't available for pictures, music was still played when people saw them. Movies about music have been produced and music about movies have been recorded. Sometimes, one of these films just stands out...High Fidelity is a comedy about Rob Gordan (John Cusack), a record store owner/operator who has recently split with his girlfriend Laura (Iben Hjejle) and now is trying to get it all together. The movie opens with her leaving and Rob giving us his top five list of the most painful breakups. At work, his two 'employees' Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black) share his passion for music and to tell people that what to listen to. The top five motif is present throughout the entire movie, giving it a unique take on life. Rob cheated on Laura, borrowed money from Laura and hasn't given it back to her, and caused Laura to have an abortion. He pretty much feels like a jerk, but it all goes away when he finds out that she is living with Ian Raymond (Tim Robbins), his former neighbor known as 'Ray'.When Rob realizes that he is miserable from thinking about his breakups from past years, he has an epiphany. If he just confronts each one individually, the pain will go away. To just see that they have moved on so he can move on as well, but the anguish over Laura resonates due to the fact that she keeps coming over to get her stuff. Now Rob must figure out if he should just move or try to make amends with Laura and get back together.Stephen Frears directs and his style is perfect for the story. Going from flashback to reality to dreamworld and back to reality effortlessly is quite an accomplishment. He takes Nick Hornby's book and makes it into something amazing. Cusack is fantastic as the funny, sometimes self loathing music enthusiast. He narrates just about the entire movie and some of the dialogue he gives us is priceless. Black and Louiso seem to be on opposite ends of the rock and roll spectrum but they come together to appreciate the art of making music even with their sometimes totally different styles. Black is very energetic as the self-proclaimed 'know it all' of rock music and Louiso is the calm, quiet rocker. Even Hjejle and Cusack's sister Joan give great performances. All together the cast did incredibly well.High Fidelity is one of the funniest and most creative comedies to hit the big screen. It is a perfect movie to just pop in one night and enjoy. It's a great date movie, buddy movie, or anytime movie. This movie will have you making 'top five' list's in no time...",10,2,4,22 August 2005
Up in the Air," The meaning of life on the road
","George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a man detached from all commitments and relationships in Jason Reitman's brilliant film Up in the Air, based on the novel of the same name by Walter Kim.Bingham is a man hired by other companies who are too afraid or lazy to fire their own employees. Bingham is trained to handle those employees who may be disgruntled, emotionally unstable, or just plain let down. In this harsh economic climate, Bingham and the company he works for is booming. Bingham spends on average about nine months of the year in the air and away from 'home' or Omaha, Nebraska. Life is good for the man who has more frequent flyer miles than one could even think of having.Everything seems to be going great until he is called back to the office and is introduced to Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), a young, Ivy leaguer who proposes that using video conferencing instead of face-to-face confrontation to fire people will save the company a large chunk of change. Bingham sees that his livelihood is being threatened, demands that he be left on the road. His boss, played by Jason Bateman, sees this as an opportunity to show Natalie the ways of the business and tells Ryan that he needs to have her tag along. Seeing as this is his only way of staying on the road, he reluctantly agrees.Bingham shows Natalie a fast paced world of concierge service, minibars, and how to manage people. What Bingham didn't expect was to see what his life has become and how he is going live out the rest of his days; alone. Unless he changes it.Clooney and Kendrick are fantastic together. Clooney's smooth talking and confident screen presence is balanced nicely by Kendrick's emotional and slightly neurotic tendencies. Along with these two is Vera Farmiga, whose relationship with Clooney's character blossoms out of their love for the road. They are an unconventional couple, but they would never admit that they're together.This is a truly remarkable story. This film has been described as 'the film of the moment,' and it is just that. There are many films coming out about the Iraq war and the impact it has on the soldiers as well as at home, but here we have one of the first films other than Michael Moore's documentary Capitalism: A Love Story, to show the economic downfall that this country has faced. It's a startling look at what is going on out there across the country. It's a poignant reminder that there are a lot of people out there suffering and have little to comfort them.Reitman does an excellent job not just selling the characters and their story but the time and space that this takes place in. We are shown office buildings void of workers, yet here comes Clooney and Kendrick to lay off even more from a business that has already been hit hard. Each lay off we witness is almost like a real testimonial. We see the sadness, the despair, and the anger that people exude when they realize their lives have been turned upside down by someone they don't ever know.There are a lot of powerful images in this film, especially where we can see how alone these characters really are. Each airport terminal starts to blend together to form this artificial, sterile, and uninviting environment that no person could truly ever love. As we delve into the life of Ryan Bingham, we see how truly alone he really is, and how he is a truly remarkable person to be able to deal with a life like this. His story is unlike any other.",10,1,6,13 December 2009
