The Blair Witch Project," Strange and different...
","The subject of the film is really good and the idea is excellent too.. But there is a very big mistake, the story is written very badly and poor. U never feel scared even if u feel that they are very scared. I am sure that if the story was written better it would be more than a film made by 3 young men..It would change the face of horror films..",Null,0,1,3 October 1999
