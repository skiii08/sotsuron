Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas takes us to worlds we could only previously imagine.
","The original Star Wars movie broke new ground in the genre of SF movies. Nothing before it had come close in terms of scope, grandeur, and enjoyment. 'Phantom Menace' continues that tradition of providing SF entertainment on an order of magnitude above the competition.  It is a stunning achievement in imaginary filmmaking.  Sure, George, it's only a movie, but man, what a movie!",10,0,0,2 July 1999
Pride & Prejudice," A great movie, but rushed for time
","The problem is, we were spoiled by the excellent BBC version which in five hours time was able to follow the book rather closely. Thus, the dialogue in this new movie version feels very rushed and condensed, as though the script had been written for the Readers Digest. It just seems that in their hurry to get their lines in, the actors' elocution in many scenes is clipped, and thus difficult to understand. Aside from the two older sisters, the three younger sisters have little opportunity to distinguish themselves or to develop their characters. There simply isn't time. I kept waiting in vain for my favorite conversations and confrontations to take place. Most were there, but shortened almost beyond recognition.Two other problems: The propensity of the Bennet family members to eavesdrop together on private conversations was extremely annoying. Also, the casting of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was a bit misguided. He seemed, at 70, more like their grandfather than their father.However, one of the many redeeming features of this movie (the beautiful locales being one of them) is the casting of Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. She was superb and radiant throughout. Her scene with Mr. Darcy at the end of the movie, where they meet by chance at dawn outside her home, has to rank as one of the most romantic scenes in cinematic history.",7,2,5,16 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Visuals 10, Plot 2
","SW3 Revenge of the Sith is the most visually stunning and graphically satisfying movie I've ever seen. It was an immense cinematic achievement to get all those incredible scenes on the screen. Yet, the plot bothers me no end. Yes, I understand that George had to connect all the dots, fill in the storyline gaps, and portray how the arch-villain Darth Vader came to be. Still, what a great movie it COULD have been - if George's hands hadn't been tied to that downer of a plot.Just one of the deleted scenes on the DVD, where Obi-Wan and Annakin escape the lair of General Grievous, gives us a teaser of what a marvelous treat this movie might have been. An involved and appealing plot concerning the adventures of these two powerful daredevils, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses while overcoming the most nefarious of enemies throughout the galaxy, could have been a classic of science fiction movie-making to rank with the best. (And at least once in the script, one would have to say to the other, 'I have a bad feeling about this.') Their chemistry, as depicted in that one deleted scene, was the stuff great movies are made of.But it was not to be. We had to stolidly sit through what we all knew was going to happen anyway. Annikin would be seduced by the Dark Side, Padme would die while giving birth to Luke and Leia, and Obi-Wan would leave his friend and apprentice in agony on the lava flows of Mustafar. What a shame. Still, as Emperor Palpatine might have said, 'It is inevitable.' But I still wonder if it would do any good to petition George Lucas to make a new movie based on the very appealing adventures of Obi-Wan and Annikin. I'm sure we could thoroughly enjoy their swashbuckling light saber battles throughout George's galaxy without contemplating what lies in their future.",10,2,6,13 November 2005
Casino Royale," This Turkey Marks the End of an Era
","As a long time James Bond movie fan, this stinker is a real letdown. Yes, there's plenty of running and acrobatics, a high body count, and collapsing buildings, but that's where the 'fun' ends. The ridiculous script with its incomprehensible dialog also subjects us to a boring interminable European poker session, total confusion where people who are supposed to be on your side aren't, and stoic resistance to torture, the latter scene being an overlong and disturbing paean to sadists and masochists. As for Daniel Craig, he is not nearly as good-looking, suave, witty, charming, debonair, and sophisticated as prior Bonds. However, he is certainly more muscular and athletic - as though that makes up for it. I just don't think the producers understand who Bond is.Also, must M always be angry and upset with our Mr. Bond? Can't she just once say, 'Hey, Jimmy, nice work, you saved the world again.'Some critics have actually praised this turkey, calling it 'darker' and 'more sinister' than prior Bond films. Talk about understatement. Where is Q with his gadgets, where is Moneypenny with her flirting, where is the charm, appeal, and finesse of prior Bond movies? Alas, gone forever I fear.",1,14,31,18 November 2006
