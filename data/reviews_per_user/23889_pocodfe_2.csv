Changeling," Gripping drama
","When not one person leaves the theater for almost two and a half hours, that speaks volumes in my book, and just show how completely gripping this film is. If you like a drama that quickly engages you and takes you to some very dark corners and even gory corners, then you will enjoy this.Beautifully set, and well told without all the confusion so typical of today's films, almost every detail is presented and cleared up concisely. I'm not ordinarily one to focus in on camera angles, lighting, etc., but the opening shot is just gorgeous, and the film is very well lit, not overly colored, and just seems to really portray the right mood and feeling. Stellar acting on the part of everyone--and their are a number of characters--really bring this film home.This is the single best film I've seen in years. It's about time we were presented with an engaging, sad, and very shocking drama, as opposed to boring remakes, sequels and lame animated films that go nowhere. This is a must see film.",7,6,10,2 November 2008
Cloverfield," Dreadful...to put it mildly
","There is no way anyone can tell me that this movie was even remotely worth seeing. They 'shaky' camera effect for the ENTIRE movie was absolutely, PATHETIC. The storyline...boring. The creature...never explained. Then again, that's the premise of the movie. Fortunately, my friend let me borrow his DVD, and after she told me she loved it, I was like 'you've got to be kidding.' Sure, people are talking about it now, but in a year, it will be totally forgotten, thank goodness. This is one reason I've stopped going to movie theaters, and probably another reason why so many theaters are closing. When exactly was the last time a really good horror movie came out?",1,1,3,8 July 2008
