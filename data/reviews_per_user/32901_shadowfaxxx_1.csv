Requiem for a Dream," Contemporary masterpiece
","This is a film that will live in you long after you've walked away from it. Cinematic innovation at it's finest - Darren Aronofsky pushes the envelope of his medium astutely and masterfully.  The performances of his actors (in particular Ellen Burstyn) are defiant, indeed revolutionary.  Artistry like this is rare - embrace and treasure it!",10,0,0,5 March 2001
