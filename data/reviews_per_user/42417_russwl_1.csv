Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Checked It Out From Our Library - Thankfully
","My wife and I could not even get through this 'film'. In reality I'm still trying to get rid of the slimy film left on my brain from taking in the 30 minutes or so we could get into.The only redeeming quality of the whole experience is that we didn't pay any money directly to see it. On the flip side, we'll never get those 30 minutes back and indirectly, I guess our tax dollars bought it. That makes me feel good...Thinking this was going to be a creative political satire was our first mistake. The humor isn't. Period. Just disgusting, vile, and flat out awful.",1,4,9,5 November 2007
