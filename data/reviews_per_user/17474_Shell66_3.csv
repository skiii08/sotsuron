Black Swan," Extraordinary movie!
","Yes, it's all true. The movie is a real masterpiece, which comes as no surprise, knowing that Aronofsky directed it. I haven't had a doubt in my mind that this was going to be a great film. The visual effects were great, the plot, the script. Everything. Except Natalie Portman. Wow. This girl is a real looker, but is a perfect example of 'beauty before talent' rule in Hollywood. Portman is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. And in 'Black Swan', she proves it once again. There wasn't a single moment in this film where I didn't think that Jennifer Connelly would have been a much, much better choice for Nina. Yes, Connelly is a bit old for the part, but she could, without a doubt, wipe the floor with Portman's wooden acting. After Portman won the Oscar for this role, I finally admitted to myself that the Oscar's really are all about commercializing. But, in the end, even Natalie's lack of talent didn't spoil this little gem. A perfect movie experience with less than perfect leading actress.",9,0,3,19 May 2011
Taken," Stop overrating mediocre films!!!
","A 7.9 stars rating on IMDb??? Are you f-ing kidding me?! That's higher than 'Girl Interrupted' and 'Vanilla Sky', though neither of those films have anything to do with 'Taken', but I'm just using them as an example of greatest movies ever. 'Taken' was OK. Very enjoyable, but, non the less, terribly, and I mean TERRIBLY clichéd and completely predictable from start to finish... Acting was horrible, especially from Famke Janssen and the princess of clichés- Maggie Grace. Wow, that girl seriously can't act. It's impossible for her, I think! In every scene (except the ones where she's drugged)she's jumping around like a total moron, to display a 17-year-old-girl type of behavior, I guess. In my opinion, she fails miserably. Totally unconvincing. Liam was good, as always. Though his lines were probably the most clichéd thing about this whole movie. 'Now is not the time for dick-measuring!' and other lines like that were just...dumb. Now, on the bright side, there ARE some cool, fast paced, typical Luc Besson chasing and fighting sequences, which were also clichéd, but still enjoyable. My main point is, people - Stop. Overrating. Mediocre. Films. PERIOD!",5,6,11,8 May 2011
Toy Story 3," Cried like a baby! Well done, Pixar!
","Oh, boy... How do you explain the excellence of this masterpiece to the new-age-hannah-montana-justin-bieber-facebook-addicted retards? You just can't I guess... So I'll try to explain it to those of you who actually HAD a normal childhood. First of all, let me just say that I wasn't a huge fan of the first two 'Toy Story' movies. For me, the first one was too short and the human animation was too...fake. The second one was a bit, well, slow. But, this one... Is a true work of art. There were scenes where I laughed so hard, my ribs started to hurt (especially in the monkey scene, I SCREAMED out of laughter for straight ten minutes!). But, what I found to be most compelling about 'Toy Story 3' is that it really made my whole childhood flash in front of my eyes. It just brought back so many memories, which I did not expect at ALL. By the end of the movie, I was crying like a baby. Pixar people have truly outdone themselves with this sparkling gem. Here's hoping for more movies from Pixar like this one in the future.",10,0,0,5 May 2011
