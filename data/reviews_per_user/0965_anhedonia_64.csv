Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Brilliant storytelling - stands on its own & superior to 'Vol. 1'
","Not being a fan of 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1' - it seemed pointless and lacked great dialogue - I was awfully apprehensive about 'Vol. 2.' And what a wonderful surprise 'Vol. 2' turned out to be. THIS is the film the first one should have been. Tarantino, again, offers a pastiche of genres, but, this time, packs it with a thoroughly engaging story, delightfully dark humor, dialogue that crackles and some inspired storytelling. 'Vol. 2' isn't as violent. Not that I am averse to violence. But, unlike in 'Vol. 1,' where it just became tedious, here, the bloodletting is handled with great aplomb and makes perfect sense.There are some marvelous moments in this second installment - a sensational trailer scene between Daryl Hannah (who hasn't looked this sexy in a movie in years) and the uncommonly gorgeous Uma Thurman; a terrific (and horrifying) sequence where the screen goes completely dark; a very funny Bride-Karen scene and some touching moments toward the end, made all the more believable in a movie of this sort because of an utterly convincing and captivating performance by Thurman.She's fantastic as the vengeful bride. And this time around, she's given some brilliant dialogue to play with. It's typical Tarantino and a pleasure to listen to, especially when delivered by the likes of Thurman, whose timing is immaculate, Hannah and David Carradine.Robert Richardson's cinematography is spectacular. The early black-and-white shot of Uma Thurman framed by the doorway of the Two Pines Wedding Chapel would have made John Ford proud. And, stick around to the very end. After all the end credits have rolled. You'll be rewarded with a nice surprise.'Kill Bill, Vol. 2' is superb storytelling. From the very first frame to the last. If I had to sit through a disappointing 'Vol. 1' to get to this, so be it. Because the payoff was truly worthwhile.",9,1,2,17 April 2004
Miracle," Blatant jingoism aside, it's an effective crowd-pleaser
","This film succeeds solely because of a sensationally good turn by Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks. It's easily Russell's best performance. He so thoroughly embodies Brooks' persona that it's easy to forget we're watching an actor.There's also wonderful supporting by from Patricia Clarkson as Herb's wife, Patty. Russell and Clarkson have tremendous chemistry together and create an utterly believable relationship on screen. And Noah Emmerich turns in a nicely understated performance as Craig Patrick.The film doesn't delve too much into the players themselves. Which is a pity, because they come off an interchangeable. But, then again, the filmmakers and Disney weren't going for a piercing study, they were aiming for a crowd-pleaser.Of course, since the game with the Soviets was 'more than just a game,' the film ratchets up the jingoism to give us an idea of what those 20 young men were playing for. So we're treated to the customary cornball moments - the flag-waving, the repeated chants of 'USA!' and the exhausted player who, during a grueling workout session after a game in Norway, yells out with nationalistic pride.The film's about 20 minutes too long, but the excitement builds well in the third act. The 'Miracle on Ice' game takes 21 minutes and they're exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping moments. Although we know the ending, it's impossible not to get drawn into the game, thanks to some terrific editing. When I saw this film in a theatre, many patrons literally were on the edge of their seats, biting their fingernails and, then, cheering when Al Michaels exclaimed, 'Do you believe in miracles?''Miracle' is one of those films that aims to make you feel good about yourself, fellow man and the country. If that's the kind of entertainment you're looking for, then this film definitely is for you. It doesn't challenge the viewer in any way, shape or form. But, dammit, the film is entertaining for the most part.Unfortunately, now that professional players have bastardized the Olympics - is it really exciting to watch the Jaromir Jagrs, Mario Lemieuxes, Kobe Bryants, Michael Jordans and Jennifer Capriatis in the Olympics? - we know we'll never experience another moment like this again.As Russell's voice-over at the end aptly points out, 'Now that we have Dream Teams, we seldom get to dream anymore.' And that's a real shame.",7,0,3,15 June 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Where's the fun in this?
","First let me say I have not seen either 'Lost' or 'Alias.' I've caught maybe a total of five minutes of both shows on the telly. However, that doesn't mean I am not a fan of J.J. Abrams. 'Joy Ride' (2001), which he co-wrote, is one of my favorite actions films. It's just a lot of fun.And that's what seems to be lacking in 'Mission: Impossible III.' True, the story isn't as cryptic as Brian De Palma's first film in this series, but that really doesn't mean anything to this film. The story apparently just serves as a means to get from one explosion to another. In fact, you could switch the special effects action sequences around and it would not matter a whit.I have no doubt that Tom Cruise's irritating behavior played a part in how people viewed this film. But Ethan Hunt's just not an interesting person anymore. As a plus, this film does have some stellar supporting players. Philip Seymour Hoffman relishes his role as the despicable Owen Davian. Too bad Abrams didn't see fit to give him more screen time and also provide Owen more time with Ethan. If you really want to see what a poor actor Cruise is, watch Ethan's scenes with Owen. Hoffman makes it look so easy. He acts circles around Cruise and you're awfully tempted to root for Owen against an incredibly dull and tepid Ethan.Michelle Monaghan is, in my opinion, a wonderful actress. But she's truly just window dressing here, a reason for Cruise to get all intense. You want to see what Monaghan really can do? Watch her in 'Winter Solstice' (2004) or, better yet, in last year's 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang.'There is a good cast - too good, in fact, for this film - peppered throughout - Ving Rhames, Keri Russell, a very sexy Maggie Q, Laurence Fishburne, Billy Crudup, Simon Pegg and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. But their roles are relegated to less than minor and they're given little or nothing to work with. This is a Tom Cruise picture - make no mistake about that. Of course, if Cruise were smart, he would've allowed the other, more talented, actors to play bigger roles. The film's biggest disappointment is that the action sequences have no zip. They're simply one loud explosion after another. There's no fun in them, nothing crazily giddy about them. And they're not inventive. Watch what Shane Black did with 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang' and you realize how much fun action sequences can be. But Abrams lacks Black's cleverness and wit. There's nothing cheeky here; everything is handled too seriously. Someone forgot they were making a summer action film.I don't doubt Abrams' talent. I now just wonder how impressive this film would've been under Joe Carnahan's guidance.",4,0,0,11 June 2006
The Hangover," A genuinely funny movie
","'The Hangover' is boorish. Vulgar. Brash. Crude. Offensive. Twisted. Politically incorrect. And it is unexpectedly and, often, side-splittingly funny, and one of the best comedies to come out of Hollywood in a long time.Here's the thing about Todd Phillips' movie: It has no pretensions about what it is. Phillips' directorial credits include 'Road Trip' (2000), 'Old School' (2003), 'Starsky & Hutch' (2004) and 'School For Scoundrels' (2006). But this is clearly his best and most consistently funny movie.Who gets the credit for this film working? Phillips or screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who, let's face it, didn't exactly hit home runs with 'Four Christmases' (2008) or 'Ghost of Girlfriends Past' (2009)? What are the chances they happened to strike gold with this one? And much has been written about how Phillips rewrote the script for 'The Hangover.' How much of that is apocryphal is unknown.What makes 'The Hangover' work - other than a welcome change of not seeing Will Ferrell - is the cast of 'relative unknowns.' We've seen them in movies before, but they tend to fall more into the category of 'that guy' than anything else. It's unlikely they remain unknown, given how hugely successful this film is.But no one in this cast - at least among the main leads - is hamming for the camera or acting as if they know what they are doing is funny. The trick here is that Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis play much of it dead pan, taking the situation they find themselves in very seriously. There is a reason why we find Frank Drebin of 'The Naked Gun' films so funny: Because Leslie Nielsen plays all his lines straight.That's exactly what Cooper, Helms and Galiafianakis do. (Compare what they do to what Ferrell did in, say, 'Old School,' and you'll see what I mean.) Just watch how Galifianakis treats a line about the Holocaust or what condiments Tigers like. They are both good lines, but what makes them very funny is that he says them so matter-of-factly.I have been a fan of Galifianakis for years. His stand-up routines are awfully funny and, most recently, I have discovered his 'Between Two Ferns' online talk show that is funnier in two minutes than most 30-minute TV sitcoms. (If you haven't seen 'Between Two Ferns,' do yourself a favor and seek it out online.) In fact, that show is a fine example of how to do comedy well. Talk about playing it straight!'The Hangover' should rightfully make Galifianakis a sought-out figure, as popular as Seth Rogen, except he's a better actor and more tolerable than Rogen. Galifianakis deserves all the success this film should bring him. He brings a certain naivet√© to his role of Alan Garner, the bride's brother. He isn't shy, but there's a sweet charm to him that makes him awfully endearing.When 'The Hangover' stumbles, it is because supporting actors Ken Jeong and Rob Riggle play their roles for laughs, over-acting and trying too hard to sell their jokes. The story bogs down when it gets too wrapped up in exposition: A needless sequence involving Jeong's Mr. Chow. Too bad, because his introduction is absolutely hysterical and the writer(s) could have included the expositionary stuff right there when we first meet Mr. Chow. The bit with Riggle seems unnecessary and too forced. His shtick works in sketches on 'The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,' but, here, it falls flat.Frankly, I was (pleasantly) surprised that I so enjoyed 'The Hangover.' The concept of bachelors heading off to Vegas for a bachelor party replete with strippers is so tired that I thoroughly expected another routine boys-will-be-boys movie. But Phillips wisely never shows us the revelry the boys got into. Instead, what we see is the aftermath as the guys try to reconstruct the previous night's events.Much is left to our imagination as the guys try to solve a mystery. They find clues, some more enticing than the other, some more revelatory than the others. Along the way, they meet a physician, Mike Tyson and a hooker (Heather Graham), who is more than a mere hooker with a good heart - she wants to meet Mr. Right. It's lovely to see Graham in a movie like this, though she isn't given much to do. She deserves to be in a hit film, considering some of the junk she has done for the past few years. Truly, clunkers, such as 'Cake' (2005), 'Gray Matters' (2006) and 'Miss Conception' (2008), do not do this woman justice. Give her good material and she shines. Her too-brief appearance on the TV show, 'Scrubs,' proves that. I hope she shows up more in 'The Hangover 2.'The humor is often rude, coarse and can be offensive. But the thing about Phillips' movie is the humor - visual and verbal - is grounded in character. We care about Alan, Stu and Phil and what happens to them as they try to find their buddy, Doug. We root for them, because, despite their boorishness, their characters have heart.'The Hangover' is funny from the very beginning. It stumbles occasionally, especially in the third act, when some of the lesser characters try too hard. But those are forgivable sins, considering how hilarious the rest of the movie is.However, if you are one of those people who frowns at low-brow humor - and some of 'The Hangover' stoops low - or is easily offended by myriad foul jokes, then might I suggest you skip this film and go see, say, 'My Life in Ruins,' a wholly insipid movie brimming with thoroughly inoffensive milquetoast characters?But if you enjoy genuinely funny movies that earn their R rating because they go for broke with their jokes, then I heartily recommend 'The Hangover.' I might be hard-pressed to see a funnier film this year.",8,1,2,17 June 2009
United 93," Compelling, tough to watch at times, though Greengrass takes license
","'United 93' is not a film you can tell your friends you loved, or even liked. Sitting through it is a tough proposition. Nevertheless, given the circumstances, writer-director Paul Greengrass made the best film possible out of this story.Is it too early? Has our psyche healed? Are we ready for films about 9/11? Well, that's what we're going to find out this year, not only with this film, but also with Oliver Stone's 'The World Trade Center.' And someone's adapting the book, '102 Minutes,' into a movie, too.Just as Greengrass did in 'Bloody Sunday' (2002), he gives 'United 93' a quasi-documentary feel with hand-held camera. It's about as close to cinema verite in fiction as we're going to get. Greengrass is awfully good at shooting hand-held films - I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Bourne Supremacy' (2004). And, truly, there is no other way he could have shot 'United 93.'Unlike 'Flight 93' - the made-for-TV film that first aired on A&E in January - 'United 93' doesn't simply concentrate on what happened aboard the plane that crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pa. Greengrass fits the hijacking of the airliner in the context of that entire, crazy day. He runs two parallel stories - the panic on the plane and the utter confusion on the ground. And unlike 'Flight 93,' Greengrass doesn't immerse his film in any sort of sentimentality. Yes, we see passengers calling their loved ones, but the conversations are all one-sided and Greengrass really doesn't stay on them for any length of time. What we get our snippets and they're more than adequate to convey the passengers' emotions.It was a smart move on Greengrass' part not to cast well-known actors in these roles. There are a few recognizable faces, but the names don't spring to mind and that unrecognizable quality lends more credence to the actors. Greengrass also doesn't bother with trivialities such as back stories and this also helps immensely. He doesn't want to spend time on typical hijacking-movie clich√©s - passengers spending time with their families, the odd coincidences, the chance meetings, all that nonsense. He gets right to the point - this day was chaotic on the ground and in the air and that's what he wanted to capture.The film also does well to grasp the chaos on the ground as military personnel and air traffic controllers tried to figure out what was happening and how they could mitigate the situation. It is obviously clear that this nation was not prepared for this and, although Greengrass doesn't go out of his way to make this point, it's abundantly clear this administration had no idea how to react. Our leaders' incompetence continues to this day and anyone who actually believes that our illustrious leader has made this world safer is positively delusional.Greengrass takes license with the story. Much has been made about how this film was made with the cooperation of the families and from thorough research of countless documents, including the official 9/11 Commission report.But clearly Greengrass' film is based on supposition. And, frankly, some of it was tough to swallow. I have no doubt everyone on board was petrified, but this film makes it seem as if the flight attendants were of no use, completely incapable of doing anything because they were so distraught and frightened, and that the passengers did pretty much everything. Also - and I have no idea who this passenger is supposed to be - but Greengrass takes a huge leap when he clearly implies one passenger not only does not approve of what the others are planning, but tries to impede them.There are also other bits - dealing with the hijackers' target, some of the goings on in the cockpit etc. - that are based purely on conjecture.The final sequences are tough to watch. However, I wish Greengrass had a bit more faith in his storytelling ability and the story to avoid relying on a pounding musical score to accompany the chaos and drive the emotion.Considering 'United 93' to be the definitive story of Flight 93 would be a mistake. It tells the story of what might have happened. And kudos to Greengrass for avoiding any sort of rah-rah jingoism in favor of a gritty, unrelentingly disturbing and uncomfortable telling of the story.I am glad I saw 'United 93,' though I honestly don't know whether it is exploitative or not. It certainly is not without its flaws. I would like to see filmmakers tackle more 9/11 films. However, it would be encouraging to see them not only handle the events of that day and how it impacted people, but also how this nation and our government has dealt with it, the changes that have taken place in our lives, the stripping away of some rights, the callousness with which this administration operates, the nationalistic rhetoric that only isolates us even more.ADDENDUM: I changed my rating for this movie after seeing Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center' only because that one made me appreciate Greengrass' film more. I still believe Greengrass took a few too many liberties, but his lean, efficient storytelling is deeply under-appreciated.",8,2,8,30 April 2006
Finding Neverland," More subtlety, less schmaltz and this could have been great
","Two performances - by Kate Winslet and young Freddie Highmore - save 'Finding Neverland' from plummeting into a routine tearjerker.You have to admire Winslet. Here's a young woman who could have had her pick of any huge Hollywood movie following 'Titanic' (1997). Instead, she decided to take on gutsy roles, women with real depth and feeling, in smaller films that took chances. 'Hideous Kinky' (1998), 'Holy Smoke' (1999) and 'Quills' (2000).These movies might not have been financial hits or even complete cinematic successes. But Winslet made them memorable and proved what a genuinely talented and versatile performer she is. Even today, she avoids blockbusters for substantive roles in quirkier films, such as 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.'In 'Finding Neverland,' Winslet plays Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, a young widow whose four young sons inspire J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) to write 'Peter Pan' after they befriend him in a park. Barrie, recovering from a critical lambasting of his latest play, finds succor in their friendship, which also is the fillip he needs as the boys and their mother revel in his wild imagination.Depp fits Barrie well. He's so chameleon-like we forget we're watching Depp. He and a radiant Winslet, who could create sparks with anyone, complement each other perfectly. The boys are delightful, but young Highmore grips us with a raw performance as young Peter. It's no wonder Depp recommended him to director Tim Burton for 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.'In many ways, 'Finding Neverland' is old-fashioned storytelling, using cinematic conventions of yore to politely show a character's declining health.The film looks beautiful. Wonderful cinematography. What bothered me is that director Marc Foster and screenwriter David Magee cop out when they had a fascinating story to tell. It's as if they know what to do to make the audience cry, so that's all they do. True, it works. Because at the screening I attended, several women were sobbing.Foster and Magee are so wrapped up in their film's magical aspect they don't bother with anything having to do with the reality of these people's lives. The supporting roles are weak. Superb actors - Radha Mitchell as Barrie's wife, Mary; Julie Christie as Sylvia's mom, Mrs. Emma du Maurier; and Dustin Hoffman as Barrie's backer, Charles Frohman - are entirely one-dimensional and given barely anything to do. Especially Mitchell's Mary, whose potential for passionate conflict is grossly underused. Foster and Magee make short shrift of these characters.Subtlety apparently is not Foster's forte. His over-rated 'Monster's Ball' (2001) would have been more powerful were it less heavy-handed. In 'Finding Neverland,' Foster treats his audience as fools. He does everything but superimpose 'This is symbolic' in some scenes and goes to great lengths to point out the obvious about how Barrie thought of certain ideas. The boys leaping on their beds gives Barrie the idea to make his 'Peter Pan' characters fly. We get it. There's no need to then actually show the boys flying. We're not that stupid.As a good-looking three-hankie tearjerker, 'Finding Neverland' succeeds, I suppose. This film very likely will win awards. But this story deserved better than what Foster did with it.",6,1,3,11 December 2004
Friday Night Lights," Well made, but nothing we haven't seen before
","There's a very good, if not great, film simmering just beneath the surface of this one. It's a story that tackles the reasons behind and the subculture of high school football, its fanaticism and why it's seemingly so essential to the survival of many communities.Be it West Texas, upstate New York, western Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, high school football breeds an enthusiastic, at times rabid, fan base more zealous than anyone who dresses up for NFL games. Their passion spreads into the social fabric of their communities, which often quite willingly spend millions of tax dollars refurbishing or building new football stadiums, but are loathe to dole out money for classrooms, libraries or books.That's what Peter Berg's film wants to capture. Unfortunately, Berg, who co-wrote the script with David Aaron Cohen, based on a nonfiction book by former Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and Berg's cousin H.G. 'Buzz' Bissinger begins well, but rapidly falls into the trap of almost every other high school football film and eventually gets mired in derivative clich√©s.I've not read Bissinger's book chronicling the 1988 season of the Permian High School Panthers in Odessa, Texas, but I can't believe it would've received so many accolades were it filled with such conventional characters and scenes as this movie.Berg and Cohen play loose with the facts - crucial moments in the film are made up - and wind up giving us something we've seen before in content, if perhaps not in style, in this genre. The writers obviously thought the changes made for better drama, but actually they wind up looking awfully conventional, if not downright hokey. Berg gives the movie a documentary feel - grainy, eye-level shots, hand-held camera for a sense of urgency. But, from what I've read about Bissinger's book, Berg might have been better served had he adhered more to the novel.Clich√©s abound in Berg's film. There's the cocky star athlete who dreams of riches, alcoholic father living vicariously through his son, relative who ignores medical advice to further an athlete's dreams, improbable come-from-behind victory. None of this seems original no matter how slickly filmed it is.Berg and Cohen don't spend enough time with the characters for us to truly care about them. We see plenty of Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), but his wife, Sarah (Connie Britton), is quite possibly the most underwritten role I've seen in a movie in years. It's essentially a nonspeaking role - she appears in several scenes, but doesn't get her first line of audible dialogue until about 80 minutes into the film, which is when we also find out the Gaineses have a young daughter. Britton's merely window dressing.What's really interesting about this story are the underlying issues of racism among the citizens of the predominantly white town, their obsession over high school football and the pressures it puts on players and coaches.Speaking of racism, I can see why some might be offended by the depiction of black people in this film. The Dallas-Carter football players, most of whom are black, are portrayed as brutes, their coaches as eager to play the race card. Also, the only questionable, and clearly bad, call made on the playing field in the important game is made by the black official.The most interesting story element are the older men in Odessa, former high school football stars, who still cling on to their glory days, still wear their state championship rings, because those were the best days of their lives. Frankly, all this makes for much more gripping and intriguing fare than the gridiron and there'd be a lot going for 'Friday Nights Lights' had Berg and Cohen cared to dig a little deeper. Instead, they opt to skirt juicy issues to concentrate on tired football-movie moments.",5,0,2,30 October 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Very funny until it runs out of steam
","There's no doubt this entertaining British comedy has all the makings of becoming a cult hit, much like the George A. Romero horror films that it pays homage to.Writers Simon Pegg (who also stars) and Edgar Wright (who also directs) clearly have a lot fun with this story. There are several moments of truly inspired comedy and understated wit. Much of the comedy here works because the actors take themselves seriously. They treat as very real the situations in which their characters get thrown into.What's clever about this film is that it doesn't come off as a pure spoof of horror films. That would be easy. Too easy. Instead, this is a horror film, but comes packed with laughs.The best jokes, actually, have little or nothing to do with the zombies and everything to do with Shaun and his friends.Pegg's ideal as Shaun, a lumbering, clueless twenty-something who works at an electronic store where he's quite possibly the oldest employee. His best friend Ed (Nick Frost) lives on Shaun's couch and plays video games all day. Which is what Shaun would love to do, too, but he can't because his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), wants him to do more with his life.Some of the comedy is very inspired. Some comedic moments actually have layers to them. For instance, when Shaun and Ed throw Shaun's LP record collection at the zombies. That scene would have worked as it is. But Pegg and Wright add another layer by having the two chaps take time to discuss which records are worth tossing.And then there's the moment when Shaun, hungover, walks through his neighborhood oblivious to what's happening around him. He's such a creature of habit that he doesn't notice obvious signs of something gone horribly pear-shaped.Unfortunately, Pegg and Wright can't sustain their comedy throughout. The film falters in the final act when Pegg and Wright literally write themselves into a corner. The film suddenly turns into a straight zombie-horror film right out of Romero's handbook. By placing their characters in an untenable situation, a place from where there's little chance of escaping, the story falls into all the conventional traps of the genre. And it's nothing we haven't seen before, right down to characters standing by windows just waiting to be yanked away by zombies.The flaw in the third act is that Pegg and Wright forgot they're making a comedy. Frankly, zombies aren't all that interesting as movie characters. Shaun and his buddies are. But turning the film into a standard zombie film wasn't the right thing to do. Not only does it bring the comedy to a screeching halt, it also makes the film drag. Even at a mere 99 minutes, this film feels about 10-15 minutes too long.However, the first two-thirds of the film are awfully funny. It's dry, bold and inventive. Too bad, Pegg and Wright just didn't have enough for a better denouement.",7,3,7,15 January 2005
Public Enemies," A muddled mess
","Why is it that anyone who is critical of Michael Mann's 'Public Enemies' is promptly branded as a 'hater' on this Web site? I don't hate this film or the filmmaker, I just believe it's not a very good film.I've enjoyed some of Mann's films in the past. I am a fan of 'Thief' (1981), 'Manhunter' (1986) and 'Heat' (1995) and thought 'The Insider' (1999) and 'Ali' (2001) were interesting. But, as far as I am concerned, 'The Last of the Mohicans' (1992) was over-blown - it is not, as one poster claimed, one of the five best films ever made; it's not even one of the 5,000 best films ever made - 'Collateral' (2004) started off intriguingly before turning into an utterly conventional thriller, and 'Miami Vice' (2006) was rubbish.But I went into 'Public Enemies' with much optimism, given that it stars Johnny Depp and Marion Cotillard. And the subject seemed thoroughly suited for Mann.What a tremendous disappointment 'Public Enemies' turned out to be.There is absolutely nothing special about this film. The best it can be called is middling. It is hum-drum, run-of-the-mill and certainly not something I expected from someone of Mann's caliber.For starters, this film is not about public enemies; it's about a public enemy. Blink and you will miss Pretty Boy Floyd. And you have no idea who Baby Face Nelson is until someone in the film points him out.The film began promisingly with the exciting breakout from an Indiana penitentiary. The cinematography looked terrific in that opening shot and there was something delightfully visceral about that sequence.But then came the rest of the film.The story moved from one tedious set piece to another. Roger Ebert, whose criticism I respect, lauded Mann for his 'meticulous' research for this film. I wonder if Mann's meticulousness included killing off Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter *before* Dillinger when, in real life, they all outlived Dillinger. And Van Meter was *not* gunned down along with Baby Face Nelson.I realize Mann's fans claim this is a movie and Mann was taking artistic license to enhance his story, as is his wont. But I wonder whether these fans would have echoed similar sentiments if Mann, say, had Muhammad Ali fight Joe Frazier in the Rumble in the Jungle in 'Ali' or had Ali lose the fight to Foreman in that film.Historical inaccuracies aside, 'Public Enemies' is just dull. Mann wants us to believe that Dillinger and Billie Frechette were soul mates. But the only word to described their relationship - as Mann shows it - is bland. Which is a shame considering he had two fine actors in Depp and Cotillard and completely wastes them. They are given very little to work with and their dialogue is, at times, downright embarrassing.Depp has oodles of charm and charisma, but he plays Dillinger solely as cool. There's nothing more to his persona, and when Depp has to be mean on a few occasions, it just doesn't work. Christian Bale, on the other hand, is entirely forgettable as Purvis. It's a nothing character and Bale plays him exactly as he has all his other recent roles. This is a somnambulist Batman and John Connor playing Purvis, mumbling his lines and showing next to no emotion. You learn nothing about Purvis throughout the entire film.I felt sorry for the wonderful Cotillard because her relatively minor role is made even more minute because her character has no depth and she gets little help from a wanting script. In fact, none of the characters has much depth, if any, and so Mann wastes a talented cast of supporting players that includes Stephen Dorff, Stephen Lang, David Wenham, Matt Craven, Giovanni Ribisi, Jason Clarke, Leelee Sobieski and James Russo.Then there's the cinematography and I really don't know if one can blame Dante Spinotti for this. I realize Mann is in love with digital technology and while that might have worked on 'Collateral' and 'Miami Vice,' it does not here. With the exception of a few lovely shots, the rest of the film looks like it was shot on someone's cheap holiday camera. I have seen home movies that looked crisper, brighter. The night-time scenes look thoroughly washed out and sans any contrast and the infamous shoot-out in Little Bohemia - which is terribly choreographed - looks like a lousy video game.I am not averse to shooting in digital. There are countless films that look terrific shot on high-definition digital. Take a peek at 'The Lookout' (2007), for instance. It looks spectacular shot on high-def. I personally believe that period pieces should be shot on film, but even granting Mann's decision to shoot digital, why on earth didn't he use, say, Panavision's Genesis or the Red One cameras? He certainly wasn't constrained by the budget.I realize Mann could take a crap at Hollywood and Vine and his fans would consider it a masterpiece. But it's still crap and just because it came from Mann doesn't turn it into gold.'Public Enemies' is simply a disappointing movie. It lacks any depth, the characters are boring at best, insipid at worst. The film ambles along without any sense of how to tell a story or put that story into the context of American history and, after a while, all I could think of was how much better Arthur Penn fared with 'Bonnie and Clyde' (1967), how much more I wanted to see that film instead and could we please get to The Biograph already.But Mann even managed to screw up the grand finale by adding an unnecessarily hokey and sentimental coda.",1,99,149,11 July 2009
Spider-Man 2," An enjoyable summer flick
","(WARNING: SOME MINOR SPOILERS)Peter Parker's having problems. Being Spider-Man isn't easy and not nearly as fun as it used to be.Peter can't keep his day job delivering pizzas, has trouble paying the rent on a hovel and could be on the verge of flunking out of Columbia. To make matters worse, he can't follow his heart and woo his true love and even his Spidey skills are waning. What is a superhero to do?It's exactly because Peter's having human dilemmas that 'Spider-Man 2' is one of the year's most entertaining and one of the best superhero films in a long time. Sam Raimi again is having a lot of fun. If you're familiar with the director's other work, you'll get a kick out of the snotty theatre usher cameo. There's even a humorous musical interlude. And how many superhero films do you know that emphasize their main theme by quoting Oscar Wilde?Unlike many sequels, this one does not simply rehash the original, though some themes are repeated. The opening credits masterfully illustrate what happened in the first film and then 'Spider-Man 2' takes off - funnier, smarter, more exciting and more imaginative. What makes it work is that Raimi never loses sight of the humanity of his characters, even the villain. Of course, it helps to have an Oscar-winning writer (Alvin Sargent) penning a script from a story by three others, including Michael Chabon.We relate to Peter's personal problems. He may be a superhero, but still has to wash his clothes at the local laundromat. And, in a nicely underplayed, yet funny, scene, we learn the Spidey outfit might not be all that comfortable, either.It's these little human moments that make 'Spider-Man 2' so thoroughly enjoyable. Tobey Maguire's a terrific young actor and makes Peter's angst utterly believable. He also has good comedic timing. J.K. Simmons returns to play J. Jonah Jameson with great comic aplomb and Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is a man conflicted by his own viciousness. He's a good man dealing with badness forced upon him.This time around, the CGI also is much better. Spidey doesn't look computer-generated when zipping through the air, leaping from building to building. But what stand out are Doc Ock's sensational arms. They have their own personalities, doffing Doc Ock's hat, handing him cigarettes, removing his sunglasses and reacting as if they were disparate characters unattached to him. They snarl, snake, do double takes, glare and even peer menacingly at him when he questions his villainy.The film drags in the second act, partly due to a surprisingly lacklustre turn by Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Her performance lacks passion. Mary Jane's scenes with her fianc√© and Peter ring hollow; there's a blandness to them that's not evident elsewhere. The film turns occasionally corny, but never campy. And somehow Raimi always manages to make it fun. Let's hope this movie franchise doesn't go the way of 'Batman' and wind up with different directors and actors. As long as Raimi directs and Maguire plays Spidey, this promises to be an exciting movie franchise.",8,0,0,9 July 2004
Alexander," And you thought Hollywood quit making epic clunkers
","Oliver Stone finally did it. He made a boring movie.Any screen writing book will tell you the first basic rule of writing a good script is show, don't tell. But Stone decided the best way to tell Alexander the Great's life was tell, don't show.No matter want you thought of Stone as a filmmaker and storyteller, his movies never were dull. Even his lesser works, 'U-Turn' (1997) and 'Any Given Sunday' (1999) had energy. Not 'Alexander.' Clumsy, overblown and leaden, this three-hour exercise in banal, mind-numbing exposition should have been an exciting and intriguing epic adventure about one of history's most fascinating and enigmatic figures. Instead, it's a tedious, laborious soap opera.Stone reduces Alexander's exploits to Ptolemy's (Anthony Hopkins) narrations and shows us just two battles - at Guagamela and India. We hear of Alexander's other advances, but see none. The two battles aren't spectacular. They're so disorganized and confusing that Stone relies on Ptolemy to tell us what happened after one battle. When we get to the film's big moment - Alexander facing up to a warring elephant in India - it has no impact because we've lost interest in this clunker. We're then treated to what seems like an acid flashback.'The film takes a bold, honest look at Alexander's life,' its Web site boasts. Poppycock. Stone wants to emphasize Alexander's bisexuality, yet doesn't have the guts to give us an honest depiction. The love affair between Alexander (Colin Farrell) loves his commander and childhood friend, Hephaestion (Jared Leto), is limited to laughable glances, an occasional shoulder rub. Give me a break! Not once do these lovers even consider a peck on the cheek. They do hug a lot, though. That's about as bold as Stone gets.Vangelis' overbearing score gives the film more dramatic weight than it deserves. From its opening - a 'Rosebud'-like moment - 'Alexander' plods along, never once finding the right mood or tone. The story whizzes all over the place, jumping from one scene to another without clarity or purpose. There's no passion or pathos anywhere. Instead of being touching, a scene where Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer) teaches a young Alexander about Greek legends - Oedipus, Achilles, Prometheus - drags on because neither actor can summon any enthusiasm.Colin Farrell does not make a convincing Alexander. He's more Alexander the Adorable than Alexander the Great. He whines and mopes rather than inspires and threatens. Though, Alexander never seems to have a bad hair day.Farrell makes no attempt to hide his Irish brogue and, with an international cast, the sm√∂rg√•sbord of accents quickly turns absurd. At one point, when Alexander argues with one of his commanders, one actor sounds Irish, the other like Sean Connery. It's priceless.Farrell's woefully miscast. His Alexander lacks passion. There's no madness to his method. Farrell's limited acting range becomes clearly evident in a scene when Alexander rallies his troops before a battle. Stone means to draw comparisons to Shakespearean Prince Hal's famous battle cry. But watch Farrell fall flat and then go watch Kenneth Branagh's mesmerizing Crispin's Day speech in 'Henry V' (1989), and you'll realize Farrell's limitations as an actor.Leto proves yet again what a wooden performer he is. Though, the poor chap's given little to do other than to make goo-goo eyes at Alexander. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers barely registers as Cassander, and Kilmer staggers about as if he's still playing Jim Morrison. With various accents pummeling the screen, it's surprising Angelina Jolie decided Alexander's mother, Olympias, should have some weird, mock Transylvanian accent. It makes it impossible to take anything she says seriously. Never mind Jolie's just a year younger than Farrell, she never ages even though Alexander, at one point, ages from 4 to 19.Just when you thought you couldn't hear a more ridiculous accent, along comes Rosario Dawson as Roxanne, Alexander's Bactrian wife. The first time we hear Roxanne speak, she stumbles on to a 'tender' moment between Alexander and Hephaestion - they're about to hug, again - glares at Alexander and asks, 'You luvf heem?' These women's accents make Kate Beckinsale's preposterous Eastern European tone in 'Van Helsing' seem genuine.If a silly accent wasn't embarrassing enough, poor Dawson then engages in a love scene where Alexander actually growls. At least, she looks magnificent in the nude. Too bad there wasn't more of that and less of everything else.Of course, no Oliver Stone film would be complete without conspiracy theories and allusions to contemporary politics. Alexander conquers Persia, part of which is now modern Iraq, because, he says, people want change and to live free. There's also mention - because showing us would make sense - of a guerrilla war the Persians waged after Alexander took Babylon.The film's packed with so many pointless scenes you wonder if Stone left anything on the cutting room floor. There's an unbearably long, terribly written shouting match between Alexander and Cleitus, needless cuts back to an older Ptolemy and a superfluous moment involving Aristotle (Christopher Plummer).A prime example of Hollywood excess, this dud cost $150 million. Just think of how many wonderful, worthy smaller-budget films could have been made, instead. And don't tell me there aren't countless terrific scripts floating around Hollywood not being read because the writers don't have the right connections.Greeks shouldn't be upset that Stone depicted Alexander as bisexual. They should be outraged he turned Alexander into a gargantuan bore.",1,5,7,27 November 2004
Troy," Crouching Trojan, Hidden Greek
","My fear is the younger generation that will undoubtedly throng to see this film will come away thinking it's an accurate depiction of Homer's epic poem.Wolfgang Petersen, whose films I usually enjoy, has made a swords-and-sandals picture, along with all the conventions that come with that genre.'Troy' is the second blockbuster of the summer of 2004 and the second disappointment. The film takes great liberties with Homer's work. In fact, the funniest bit is during the end credits when it states, 'Inspired by Homer's 'The Iliad.'' If only Homer could sue.Screenwriter David Benioff essentially only uses the basic premise of Helen being taken by Paris to Troy. From there, he veers wildly from the great work. Characters who didn't die in the Trojan War are killed off; warriors who shouldn't be in the Trojan Horse appear inside; Achilles' relationship with Patroclus is altered - no doubt to appease the thousands of women who adore Brad Pitt; and the decade-long war is reduced to a mere fortnight, as if the Greeks are enjoying an excursion on the beaches of Troy. Those are just some of the changes. There isn't enough room to list all the ways in which Benioff ignores Homer's work.Granted, some license is allowed, but surely Benioff could have stayed a bit more true to the source material. Imagine, for instance, writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell killing off Robert E. Lee at Little Round Top in 'Gettysburg' (1993).There are two good moments in 'Troy.' The first, the fight between Achilles and Hector lasts about four minutes and is well choreographed (though, a bit anachronistic, because, at times, the fighting tends to look more like Asian martial arts); the second, Priam's (Peter O'Toole) scene in Achilles' tent, where he begs for the return of Hector's body. O'Toole never overplays the scene and brings such pathos to the moment that he offers a glimpse of what this film might have been had it better, smarter dialogue and stronger characters.The dialogue, at times, is downright laughable - there's Achilles calling Agamemnon, 'You sack of wine' (I suppose, 'Saracen pig!' and 'Spartan dog!' had already been used years before) and Helen telling Paris, 'Last night was a mistake.' (Yeah, but she'll always have Paris.)Pitt is terribly miscast as Achilles. Pitt spends much of his time being utterly expressionless. Orlando Bloom, who delivers every line with overwrought emotion, is way out of his league in this picture, and Garrett Hedlund fails miserably as Patroclus, who apparently is Achilles' cousin.On the other hand, Eric Bana, his pathetic dialogue notwithstanding, shines as Hector and Brian Cox gives Agamemnon some meat. And O'Toole still has one of the most expressive faces (and eyes) ever put on film. The rest of the cast - Saffron Burrows, Diane Kruger, Brendan Gleeson and Rose Byrne - are mere window-dressing. And the lovely Julie Christie shows up for a barely a minute.At 163 minutes, 'Troy' is heavy-going, at times, tedious when it's not supposed to be. There's no real excitement in this film. The battle scenes are nothing spectacular and, often, have a bit too much CGI.I have no doubt 'Troy' will make a lot of money. It's one of those critic-proof films. But given Petersen's previous efforts, I went in expecting to be awed and thrilled, and came away dejected and disappointed.",4,2,5,18 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Good, but Best Picture material?
","For the sake of full disclosure: In case my diatribes about the Bush administration's incompetence, atrocious behavior and fear-mongering aren't an ample indication, I am a liberal. I'm pro-choice and pro-gay rights. I see no reason why homosexuals should not be allowed to wed and enjoy the same privileges married couples do. The whole protect-the-sanctity-of-marriage argument from the right comes from sanctimonious politicians who have no qualms about keeping mistresses.That having been said, on to 'Brokeback Mountain.' This is a good film. But it's also rather flawed and, frankly, undeserving of a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Of course, with all the accolades being tossed on it, instead of better, more compelling films, it appears Ang Lee's film will walk away with the top Oscar prize next month.'Brokeback Mountain' doesn't get cooking until Michelle Williams shows up as Ennis' (Heath Ledger) wife, Alma. However, this doesn't happen for about an hour into the story and that's just one of the film's myriad problems.Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana - and director Lee - take about an hour to set up what they easily could have accomplished in, say, 20 to 30 minutes, if that. Lee spends so much time trying to introduce us to Ennis and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), but neither he nor the writers do anything substantial with that time. We're treated to gorgeous views of vistas, shepherding - yes, these cowboys herd sheep - and shots of Ennis and Jack spending the hours together in the hills, seemingly bored.Trouble is, there's nothing compelling about these scenes or the characters in these initial moments. And despite all this time together, there's never any sense of Jack feeling any closeness to Ennis. They chat - OK, Jack chats, Ennis mumbles. Often unintelligibly. (If you thought Marlon Brando mumbled his dialogue, wait 'til you get a load of Ledger.) At some point we had to feel a sense that these two connected, that there's deep feeling for one another. That never happens. Come the seduction, it's more lust appeal than any sense of budding love. By the time Jack utters the film's famous line, 'I wish I knew how to quit you' - you just know this one's going to be spoofed soon - you have to wonder if he really means it. Because the characters, especially Jack, never express any sense of genuine love. These guys just have the hots for each other. It's as if the writers and Lee wanted to make a social commentary, but didn't have the guts to show us anything.The film's most interesting and exciting characters are the two women - Alma and Lureen (Anne Hathaway). Williams takes a lousily written role - you get the impression the writers simply wrote, 'She mopes,' 'She mopes again,' 'She mopes yet again' - and turns it into something special. Williams makes Alma a thoroughly convincing person, a deeply complex woman grappling with alien issues she can't quite comprehend or know how to handle, a woman with an incredibly personal moral crisis. She truly deserves her Oscar nomination.Hathaway, like Williams, gets saddled with an underwritten role. After a topless romp, the writers relegate her to a role that's not even marginal; though they do sport her with some creative hairstyles. Hathaway does her best, but she's not quite of Williams' calibre, yet, and even a stronger actress would've struggled with this lackluster role. Lureen could've been a fascinating woman and provided the plot with exciting possibilities. But that was not to be.The lead performances are palatable, but Ledger and Gyllenhaal remain so aloof, it's downright impossible to be drawn into their love affair. This film also needed tighter editing. There's an utterly superfluous flashback toward the end that does nothing for the story.Criticizing this movie shouldn't make you a pariah. That's just political correctness run amok. The filmmakers clearly wanted to make a socially relevant film. And this is as much about societal prejudices as it is a love story about two men. But the writers never delve into anything in any real way. They begin with a stupefyingly dull first hour and skirt the message and love story.There've been many other much better, more moving gay-themed films that never got any attention. The wonderful Australian film, 'The Sum of Us' (1994), starring Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson, springs to mind. There's more humor, genuine emotion and love in 10 minutes of that film than in all 134 minutes of the over-hyped 'Brokeback Mountain.'Subject matter alone should not automatically make a film good. Which seems to be the case here. Had this been about a man and a woman, viewers would see how humdrum it is.Interestingly, I saw this comment in Rolling Stone from Heath Ledger about the first time he saw the film: 'I understood that it flowed, it was presented well. But whether it was good, whether it was bad - we walked out not knowing what we'd just watched.'What's ultimately infuriating about 'Brokeback Mountain' is that this story deserved to be told, only more compellingly and movingly. 'Millions,' 'A History of Violence,' 'Match Point' or 'Junebug,' deserved Best Picture Oscar nods before this one did. Goes to prove what a ton of hype can do to a fairly pedestrian movie.",5,5,36,20 February 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Hokey, but entertainingly enjoyable
","Surely no one's walking into Roland Emmerich's 'The Day After Tomorrow' expecting to see a neorealist masterpiece or some profoundly moving epic about the human condition.The man loves to blow things up on screen and that's exactly what he does in 'The Day After Tomorrow.' Of Emmerich's last four pictures, I enjoyed the 'Day' films - 'Independence Day' and this one. The other two - 'The Patriot' and 'Godzilla' were crap.'The Day After Tomorrow' has some terrific visual effects - the destruction of the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles, the tidal wave in New York City, the west coast twisters.Of course, the story is conventional. You have the customary protagonist who needs to rescue his family, the cute animal, the love interest, the people who ignore common sense and set out on their own because they know better and, of course, the self-sacrificing supporting character.The dialogue is hokey at times, the plot a bit like Swiss cheese and the performances nothing out of the ordinary. Though, British actor Ian Holm manages to bring a semblance of depth to his small role, proving yet again how good he is at his craft.Question the film's science, if you must. The filmmakers don't try to mask the identity of who the vice-president and president are based on. Though, the most preposterous thing in the film is that our veep would actually show up at an environmental conference.'The Day After Tomorrow' has all the requisite ingredients for a summer blockbuster. And it delivers. Thankfully, without an overbearingly loud or obnoxious musical score. Are there unprovoked chuckles? Yes. Predictable scenarios? You betcha. But is it fun and entertaining? Absolutely.",7,0,0,1 June 2004
Match Point," Absolutely engrossing - one of Allen's very best
","We hear Nola Rice before we see her in 'Match Point.' Scarlett Johansson poses an enticing query in a low, husky voice that promptly establishes Nora's persona. The scene that follows between Nola and Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is just one of the many joys in Woody Allen's new film, his best in years and one of the finest in his remarkable oeuvre.Critics have said that if you knew nothing about his film and walked in after the credits, you'd be hard-pressed to recognize it as a Woody Allen film. They're right.Although there are some familiar touches that fans of Allen would recognize - how many filmmakers would have a character looking for his 'Strindberg book,' after all? - this is quite possibly the most un-Allen like film he's made.There's no schlemiel character or even an Allen surrogate here. No excessively neurotic people - although I'm a huge fan of his neuroses. Although Allen's stepping into English society for the first time, he doesn't seem out of place one bit. Though I doubt very much a London cop would say, 'Schmuck.' But such a trivial faux pas can easily be forgiven considering what a gem Allen's created.Having seen all of Allen's films - most of them several times - I must admit I never would've pegged him to make a masterful thriller that raises important philosophical questions, places his characters in moral crises and creates tense moments and a delicious twist that would have made Hitchcock smile.I know some have complained that Allen dealt with similar moral dilemmas in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' (1989). True. But surely that doesn't mean he can't tackle those issues again. F.W. Murnau dealt with good vs. evil in 'Sunrise' (1927), but that hasn't stopped countless filmmakers from delving into that topic ever since.Allen assembled a superb cast. I've never been a fan of Rhys-Meyers because I've always viewed his performances as being somewhat affected. As tennis pro Chris, however, Rhys-Meyers is convincing as a man working himself up the social strata and enjoying the luxuries that come with it. The moral crisis he faces is dealt with honestly and it's to Rhys-Meyers' credit that I actually found myself rooting for him.The story's great moral complexity is that you also find yourself desperately not wanting to see his wife, Chloe (Emily Mortimer), hurt, either. Mortimer's so absolutely lovable and charming that Allen toys with our emotions as we envision her world collapsing.But the film's bright, shining light is the glorious Johansson.'I'm not beautiful,' Nola says at one point in the film. 'What I am is sexy.' Johansson has never been better in a film - the Best Supporting Actress Oscar should go to either her or Amy Adams for 'Junebug,' unless Johansson snags a Best Actress nod - as she completely captivates us. It's a subtle performance that captures every nuance of Nola's complex and confused character.Johansson also has never looked sexier on the screen. Cinematographer Remi Adefarasin's camera adores her, much like how Nestor Almendros' camera loved Meryl Streep.Adultery and obsession are not novel ideas to cinema or Woody Allen. Yet, he's drawn utterly believable characters - albeit in the upper class - and his film succeeds on many levels.After a few stumbles, Allen's found his touch, his fine touch, again. With 'Match Point,' he proves why he's a cinematic genius, someone who can almost 40 years after directing his first film still surprise us and show us what a unique filmmaker and storyteller he is.",9,1,1,29 January 2006
Hotel Rwanda," A brilliant movie that deserved a Best Picture Oscar-nomination
","At one point in 'Hotel Rwanda,' our hero Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) asks an American TV reporter (Joaquin Phoenix) how the western world could not intervene after seeing scenes of women and children being hacked by machete-wielding Hutu militia.How could they not, indeed! As we all know, the west didn't intervene. Not surprising, really. After all, this was Africa and Rwanda had no oil reserves. The people being killed were innocent men, women and children, but they were poor and black.A few years ago, former President Bill Clinton apologized to Rwandans for not intervening during the 100-day massacre that saw about one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus slaughtered in the most barbaric manner. It was gracious of Clinton, but a fat lot of good his apology did to the people who were killed and their families.The Rwandan genocide - that's what it was, though western leaders split hairs over the meaning of genocide ¬ñ also was a black mark on western nations, which simply got their citizens out of Rwanda and then remained indifferent to the senseless killings.Terry George's film gives us one story about the Rwandan genocide, of one hero, Paul, a savvy, clever and cunning manager of a swank, four-star Belgian hotel in the capital, Kigali. When the massacres began, Paul, a Hutu, sheltered more than 1,200 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in the hotel and saved them from the wrath of the bloodthirsty mobs.Working from a smart script by Keir Pearson and George, 'Hotel Rwanda' contains gutwrenching and emotionally trying moments not seen on the big screen since 'Schindler's List' (1993). But whereas Spielberg's masterpiece was more arty and artistic - and I don't mean that pejoratively - George's film seems more immediate. Maybe it's because we now see a similar slaughter of poor, downtrodden people in the Darfur region of Sudan and, again, western nations aren't doing much other than threatening to rap the knuckles of the bad guys like angry teachers. This crisis gives 'Hotel Rwanda' a sense of urgency.As visceral as this film is at times, George handles everything in muted fashion. We never see the horrors firsthand. There's brief news footage of people being killed and one particularly searing scene when Paul and his bellhop Gregoire (Tony Kgoroge) find themselves on a bumpy road. The moment's made more horrifying because George unveils it quite matter-of-factly.Making a PG-13 film about genocide requires numerous compromises. Putting most, if not all, of the violence off-camera is one such bargain George made. True, a closer look at the massacre would have rightly tortured us. But the film, nevertheless, works without gruesome moments. Pearson and George set out to make a story of heroism, survival, love and compassion amid the madness. And they succeeded.Cheadle carries the entire film. There isn't a false note in his performance. For years, he's turned in one superb performance after another. He's one of those actors who never hits it wrong and whose performances always stand out even if the films themselves aren't all that memorable. Here, he's in equal measure the smooth manager, man with a conscience and frightened husband and father. You can sense Paul's frustration, though Cheadle rarely displays any vulnerability.He gets great support from Sophie Okonedo as Paul's Tutsi wife, Tatiana, and Nick Nolte doing his best work in years as a Canadian United Nations officer, Colonel Oliver. Okonedo and Cheadle are utterly believable as a couple. They have one traumatic scene on the hotel roof, a quietly powerful moment that tugs at our heartstrings as we watch two people who love each other try to deal with what could happen. Okonedo conveys anger, fear and pain without ever turning the moment sentimental or needlessly overwrought. That's why the moment's shattering.'Hotel Rwanda' isn't flawless. George doesn't harshly indict the west for its indifference. Also, some scenes, especially one near the film's end, seem staged for obvious dramatic effect, to play with our sense of sympathy and dread. But minor faults can easily be forgiven because the rest of the film works so well, never sensationalizing any moment. The film's straightforward approach gives it more power, makes it more trenchant and meaningful.I would like to believe that we learn from history and the more powerful western nations will always come to the aid of oppressed people everywhere. But we're doing little in Darfur and although President George W. Bush openly touts his vision to spread liberty and democracy to oppressed peoples everywhere, I doubt he actually means it. After all, this freedom doctrine was something he created only after his initial justification for waging an unjust war - Iraq's supposed stockpiles of WMD - proved to be wholly without merit or fact. I doubt he actually considers bringing liberty to places like Zimbabwe or Burma. He speaks of the need for people to be free, conveniently ignoring some dictatorial nations - Pakistan and Turkmenistan, for instance - because they happen to be our allies. And so the dumb foreign policy continues.I can only hope the success of 'Hotel Rwanda' will prompt other gutsy screenwriters and filmmakers to tell us more stories about the horrors that took place and the complacency of industrialized nations that could have helped and chose not to.",8,50,59,16 February 2005
We Were Soldiers," Daddy, what is a good movie? Not this one, honey.
","This movie truly is a huge disappointment.The first 45 minutes or so are awful and riddled with dreadful dialogue. When the movie finally shifts to the battle, it really doesn't click either. The characters are all cardboard and clich√©d. Pardon the pun, but you can start picking off the guys who are going to die in battle minutes after we are introduced to them.Who knew that the John Wayne-esquire protagonist would make a comeback? There he is, Mel Gibson, standing tall, ignoring bullets whizzing by, nonchalantly knocking off enemy soldiers as if they were mere nuisances.And there's even a ridiculous deus ex machina moment in this film that is laughable.The women in this movie are mere decorations and even in those scenes, you can predict what's going to happen. And Madeleine Stowe had to pick this film not to shed her clothes, which would have been a small bonus.I realize the need to make a film that honors those who fought and died valiantly in this battle. But this film is not the one to do that. I don't mind that the film never questions why we were in Vietnam or whether we should have been there.This film - like 'Black Hawk Down' - wants to simply tell the story of the battle and those who participated in it. But surely not every soldier who fought was a clich√© from almost every war picture that was ever made. The only character missing was that young, late teen-age soldier, nicknamed with the state he hails from, sitting in the trenches looking at the picture of his childhood sweetheart Betsy, telling his buddies that when he returns stateside, he's going to go back to the farm and raise a family with her and then...wham! - a sniper's bullet slams into his skull. And his buddies get really angry now because this time the bad guys killed Wisconsin.And in case you were wondering whether Randall Wallace has gotten over his penchant for slow-motion, fear not. This movie's got plenty of those shots, too, in case the audience was just too dumb to realize the significance of the moment.If you want to see a good movie about the early days of Vietnam, rent 'Go Tell the Spartans,' starring Burt Lancaster.",1,16,28,4 March 2002
Ocean's Twelve," Soderbergh's slumming
","About 80 minutes into 'Ocean's Twelve,' there's a rather clever joke involving Tess. If you pay attention, you'll realize it's set up much earlier in a quick conversation between two characters. Even though you know it's coming, the joke's pretty funny. And it's made funnier by the novel use of a cameo appearance. This is not just a cameo for cameo's sake, but actually using a person to play with the plot. A nice touch, it is.Unfortunately, that's about as interesting as director Steven Soderbergh's dull film gets. Reuniting the cast from the original remake, 'Ocean's Eleven' (2001), this one finds Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his band of thieves running to Europe to pull of heists to pay off Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), the hotelier they ripped off in the first film.Trouble is if Terry didn't intimidate them the first time, why would they really get worried this time around? Ah, but that's thinking too much about this fluffy, airy film that simply tries to float on occasionally amusing riffs and star power. And why not? Consider the stars. Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Vincent Cassel.The last two are new this time. Zeta-Jones shows up as Isabel, a Euro cop and former lover of Pitt's character. And Cassel gets thrown in to the mix as French master burglar Fran√ßois Tourlour, who challenges Danny to a contest to see who the better thief is. Yes, that's actually a subplot in this film; one of a few superfluous subplots, including one about Isabel's father.One wonders why Isabel is in this movie at all. Talk about adding a character simply so it can be played by a movie star. Too bad, the star happens to be untalented. Sorry, pretty she might be. But Zeta-Jones quite possibly is the most over-rated actress working today. Sure, she may have won an Oscar for 'Chicago,' but clearly any of the other nominees - Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep, Queen Latifah or Kathy Bates - actually deserved it that year.Zeta-Jones couldn't generate sparks with rocks if she rubbed them ceaselessly for hours. What passes for chemistry between Zeta-Jones and Pitt is laughable. She has one expression and she sticks to it.Since the story's set in Europe, Soderbergh apparently felt the need to give his film a European feel. In fact, the music and camera work gave me the impression Soderbergh was trying to emulate or, at least, pay homage to the films of the French New Wave.Problem is, Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol and others had no qualms about something bad happening to their protagonists. But 'Ocean's Twelve' is pure Hollywood flash. And with this kind of star power, do you really wonder whether any of these characters would be sacrificed? With none of them under any real threat and the ending a foregone conclusion, all you're left is with actors trying to look and sound cool and charming. But George Nolfi's script - initially written for John Woo and then reworked for this sequel - thinks it's smart, when it isn't.Occasionally, the film wins a chuckle. But there's nothing genuinely exciting or even vaguely suspenseful about this story. In Soderbergh's breezy, but fun, 'Ocean's Eleven,' the dialogue crackled, characters made us laugh and the story had some grit. Not even the bumbling Malloy brothers can save the sequel. We can only hope that Danny Ocean and his crew will not find the need for another outing.",4,3,4,20 December 2004
Crash," A bit preachy, but still thought-provoking
","Twenty minutes into 'Crash,' I realized none of the characters we'd been introduced to was all that likable. Not one person. They were all racist on some level - from the gun store owner who spews xenophobia in true post-9/11 fashion to the LAPD Detective Ria (Jennifer Esposito), who gets rear-ended at the start of the film by a Chinese driver; from LAPD Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), who has one of the film's most unsettlingly creepy moments during a bogus traffic stop, to the D.A.'s hysterical wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock), who clearly has race issues.And I wondered what exactly writers Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco were trying to say. By the end of the film, their message is clear. This is a movie about the ridiculousness and stupidity of prejudice and intolerance. It doesn't matter whether you're white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Persian, Muslim, Christian or Jew. Prejudice is within all of us and, in this case, comes out in all its ugly glory. This is life in the 21st century melting pot, except our irrational fears and prejudices don't really allow for much melting.But it's also more than that. 'Crash' also is about getting beneath the surface. People are not what they seem. Just when we think we've encountered a slimy S.O.B., he turns around and does something good. And when we meet a wholesome, righteous person, he turns around and shocks us with abhorrent behavior.Maverick American filmmaker Robert Altman clearly influences Haggis' storytelling style. Haggis weaves all his disparate tales together in Altmanesque fashion. This film borrows its style from 'Nashville' (1975) and 'Short Cuts' (1993), and even the other Altman-influenced movie, Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Magnolia' (1999). And Haggis does it smoothly. He picks up stories just when they're fading from memory. He ties it all together very well. And, you could argue, a bit too well. Because some of the transitions from one character's tale to another depends a lot on coincidence. In this case, sometimes it's a bit too coincidental that one character would run into another. But it's a conceit I'm willing to buy. Because despite this movie-flaw, 'Crash' still pulls us in quite remarkably.There's nothing needless or wasted in this film. True, you're being pulled in by coincidences, but that's also the film's charm. The stories occasionally get overwrought, but Haggis also pulls a few surprises, a few moments that completely jolt the audience.What surprised me were some of the performances. Yes, we know we're going to get a great one from Don Cheadle. The man never disappoints. Here, he again proves why he's one of the best. Dillon plays a despicable cop to perfection - his initial scene with Thandie Newton will make your skin crawl - but he doesn't turn Officer Ryan into a one-dimensional monster. It would have been easy to do so, but Dillon's adds great depth to his persona and, to his credit, makes us care about this person. Surprisingly, Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges turn in performances that I honestly never thought they had in them. After 'Crash,' why on earth would Bullock ever return to making crappy romantic comedies?Haggis and Moresco also deal with our nation's post-9/11 intolerance of anyone who even resembles an Arab and our collective ignorance about other cultures. In one telling moment, an Iranian woman washes away racist graffiti and wonders, 'When did Persians become Arab?' I don't think the film's anti-gun message is coincidental, either. Haggis makes it clear that our easy access to handguns clearly ignites or exacerbates tense situations. The film's virtues outweigh its less-than-stellar moments. Despite its flaws, including being less than subtle about being preachy and one too many contrived coincidences, this film makes you think. How many modern American movies can you say that about?",8,3,9,21 May 2005
Closer," Love bites, truth stings and it's all very good
","'Why is love not enough?' a tearful Alice (Natalie Portman) asks her boyfriend Dan (Jude Law) at a crucial point in 'Closer.'Her question is at the crux of Mike Nichols' brutal film about love, lust, lies and the lengths to which human beings go to make themselves happy, even at someone else's expense.Be warned: If you go to movies to be entertained and feel good about life, 'Closer' isn't for you. It's not a fluffy romantic comedy, despite starring Portman, Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. It's a disquieting film that frankly and bluntly discusses sex and human relationships. Also, if you believe, say, the execrable 'The Bird Cage' (1996) was Nichols' finest work, you'd be better off staying away.'Closer' recalls Nichols' best work very early in his career, when he made two great movies about relationships - 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' (1966) and 'Carnal Knowledge' (1971). He didn't quite rekindle the same magic in 1986's 'Heartburn.' This time, he comes closer. The characters in 'Closer' aren't quite George and Martha, though you can certainly picture Larry (Owen) and Anna (Roberts) turning into Edward Albee's famous wedded pair when they get older.What makes 'Closer' absorbing are two terrific performances by Portman and Owen. Law's acceptable. Unfortunately, Roberts is the weak link. She's a pretty woman adept at playing spunky, lighthearted comedic roles. Even her Oscar-winning Erin Brockovich (Laura Linney should have won that year) was more comedic than dramatic. When it comes to drama, however, Roberts can be downright awful. 'Mary Reilly' (1996), anyone?Roberts' dramatic range is about as wide as Patrick Swayze's. She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. In 'Closer,' she's out of her depth. Whenever she's on screen, you can feel the story sputtering as she struggles with trying to make her role real, something it desperately needs. You see her bland and expressionless Anna - especially during a critical scene with Larry - and wonder how much better actresses with real dramatic talent, say, Cate Blanchett or Natasha Richardson (who played Anna on Broadway), would have been. And how much sharper and more potent 'Closer' would have been.Portman, on the other hand, is sensationally good as young Alice. Her two performances this year - in 'Garden State' and here - might just be enough to wash off the bad taste of the next 'Star Wars' film, if her stiff turns in 'The Phantom Menace' (1999) and 'Attack of the Clones' (2002) are any indication of what to expect.Her Alice has the ideal amount of charm, perkiness, vulnerability and confidence. She warms our hearts with her giggle, breaks 'em with her tears. This beautiful young actress has one heck of a career ahead of her.Owen is deliciously smarmy as Larry, a man who simply revels in playing mind games with people, and Law's wimpy enough to be convincing.'Closer' isn't so much a love story as a chilling tale about what happens when couples lose their spark, when they start tiring of each other and find new people more attractive. People usually lie to keep the harsh truth from a loved one. Not here. These people tell the truth no matter how hurtful it might be. But they also lie. 'Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off,' Alice observes. 'But it's more fun if you do.'These characters aren't being cruel only to be kind; they're being cruel for the sheer pleasure of it. They may not be completely familiar with one another, but they know which buttons to push. And they do it with such glee. Especially Larry, whose final words to Dan don't simply cut to the bone, they saw right through. And the smug expression on Owen's face is priceless.Patrick Marber's smart script, based on his hit play, often bristles with ferocious honesty. Watching these people prey on each other's vulnerabilities can be painful to watch, yet it's compelling. One particularly candid moment between Larry and Alice stings because neither knows when to stop. That scene would have absolutely sizzled with Blanchett, by the way.The characters are unsympathetic; yet, rotten as they are, there's something awfully interesting about them. Not everything about 'Closer' rings true. But there are many more true moments than false. 'Everyone loves a big liar,' Alice tells Larry, and nothing in society today seems to suggest otherwise. Just take a look at who our elected leaders, pop icons and sports heroes are.Genuinely adult films are rare these days. So it's refreshing to watch a film that isn't dumbed-down or pandering to the lowest common denominator. As much as romantic-comedies and action-adventure yarns should be made to keep the masses happy, American cinema would be so much the richer if Hollywood made more films like 'Closer.' The film deals with harsh issues bound to unnerve many because much of it looks and feels real.",8,7,13,11 December 2004
The Bourne Ultimatum," Redefining edge-of-your-seat
","How refreshing it is to sit in a theater and be thoroughly engrossed and excited by an intelligent, brave, adult thriller that actually makes the audience think. Forget 'Star Wars,' 'Indiana Jones' or even the over-hyped 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogies, the 'Bourne' films might very well be the most entertaining and thrilling trilogy made.'The Bourne Ultimatum' begins a few minutes after 'The Bourne Supremacy' (2004) ended. And from the opening foot chase through the streets of Moscow (with the former East Berlin substituting for Moscow), 'The Bourne Ultimatum' turns into a relentless and smart thrill ride as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) tries to figure out what happened to him.True, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is essentially a chase picture. But thanks to director Paul Greengrass - what a brilliant move it was to bring him back for this film - Damon and some crackingly good editing by Christopher Rouse, the film is never dumbed-down. Some of it does seem preposterous, but the filmmakers and the actors - and there are some good ones here, including the always wonderful Joan Allen, David Strathairn and Julia Stiles - we are drawn into Bourne's predicament and find ourselves taken for one delightfully, pulse-pounding ride. The New York chase and the scene at Waterloo Station are two of the most tense, exciting sequences I've seen in a long time. Damon truly has grown into this role and has quietly turned into a fine actor. Greengrass seems to get the best out of him. So it isn't surprising that the two are teaming up for 'Imperial Life in the Emerald City,' about our illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq. I've always been a huge fan of Strathairn's - see some of his terrific work in John Salyes' movies - and in 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' he brings such quiet venom to Noah Vosen that you can just imagine the menace lurking under his persona. As for Allen, someday she'll win an Oscar, and it would be a well-deserved award. She is truly one of the best out there. And, this time, Stiles gets a juicier bit, but proves worthy of her expanded role.As for the cinematography. I realize there are countless complaints about the use of hand-held shots and Greengrass certainly loves dong that. In fact, he seems to specialize in that. I didn't think it caused motion sickness. And I didn't find it distracting in the least. Greengrass' approach actually works very well for the story he's telling. It worked well on 'The Bourne Supremacy' and it does even better here.What's ultimately most satisfying about the 'Bourne' movies - and especially 'The Bourne Ultimatum' - is that it shows that you can make an adrenaline-rushed action film, but still make it clever, snappy and entertaining. In an age when Hollywood likes to turn pro wrestlers into stars and give them action films with dumb dialogue, films such as the 'Bourne' movies are rare and should be appreciated. Here's hoping we get more of this kind and less of, say, 'The Condemned' (2007) or 'The Rundown' (2003).",9,0,1,30 December 2007
The Aviator," Good, not great, Scorsese
","The first 10 minutes of 'The Aviator' are more exciting and emotionally gratifying than the entirety of Martin Scorsese's previous epic, 'Gangs of New York' (2002).You gotta hand it to Scorsese. The man learns from his mistakes.After casting the pretty, but talentless, Cameron Diaz in 'Gangs of New York' and watching that turn into a wretched film - sorry, Daniel Day-Lewis' commanding performance aside, that film's positively dull - he thought better when it came to casting 'The Aviator.' Yes, he cast beautiful women in this, too. But he found beautiful women who are also incredibly talented. Cate Blanchett and Kate Beckinsale.Not that 'The Aviator' doesn't have its attractive actress with unproven talent. Scorsese cast singer Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow, but then wisely gave her just two lines of dialogue in the entire film.'The Aviator' actually seems like two films. The first part deals with Howard Hughes' (Leonardo DiCaprio) obsession to make movies and with gorgeous women. The second part delves into Hughes' fight with Pan Am and Congress, and his better-known obsessive behavior - collecting and storing his urine in jars, for instance - that turned him into the world's most famous recluse.The first part is interesting. The second is not.After a brief, rather Oedipal prologue that foreshadows Hughes' odd behavior later, writer John Logan gets right into the Hughes' adult life. Scorsese cuts to the chase, showing us the first year of the filming of 'Hell's Angels' (1930).The entire sequence about 'Hell's Angels' is not only fascinating but also breathtaking when Scorsese takes to the skies to show the filming of the WWI dogfights in the film. The spectacular aerial fight alone proves what a master filmmaker he is.About 30 minutes into the film, we meet Katharine Hepburn, played marvelously by Australian actress Blanchett, and the film takes off. Blanchett completely dominates the screen. She captures every nuance of a young Hepburn. Her Hepburn's got spunk, attitude, charisma and you forget you're watching Blanchett. Hers is one of 2004's best performances.Later, we get another pleasant surprise - young Beckinsale as screen siren Ava Gardner. After the wretched 'Van Helsing,' it's good to see Beckinsale putting her talent to better use. She may not be physically built like Gardner, but she carries off the role with poise and panache. She's thoroughly believable as the legendary actress.'The Aviator' would've benefited greatly had it concentrated more on the Hughes-Gardner relationship and less on Hughes' eccentricities.In fact, it's those two women who keep the film interesting. When they leave the story, the film falls flat. The other characters are not nearly as interesting as these two women and it's to these actresses' credit that they so completely take over a film that's not about their characters.There are some fine supporting performances. Alec Baldwin's turned into a good character actor and the always-brilliant Ian Holm makes it all look so easy as Professor Fitz. There's a sensationally funny bit when Hughes forces Fitz to pose as a mathematician to prove to movie censors that Jane Russell's cleavage in 'The Outlaw' (1943) isn't all that revealing.Chances are, Scorsese will win the Oscar. He deserves a nomination, but I don't know whether he deserves to win for this movie. If he does, I'm certain it would be because Oscar voters were too dumb not to reward him for directing 'Raging Bull' (1980) and 'GoodFellas' (1990).My enjoyment of 'The Aviator' boiled down to one person - Cate Blanchett. Oh, what a tremendous difference real talent makes.",7,5,9,15 January 2005
The Village," Here's the twist: This film's a terrible bore
","Someone forgot to tell writer cum director M. Night Shyamalan that creepy, horror movies should be creepy and frightening.Despite an intriguing premise, 'The Village' is one of the most tepid, slow-moving, humorless and uninspiring horrors I have seen in a very long time. Forget being scared; you're likely be snoozing during the few moments that pass for scary in this film because much of it's such a yawn.The blame falls squarely on Shyamalan. He might be a skilled director, but he needs to hire a talented screenwriter to pen his stories. He's obviously so enamored by his own writing that he fails to realize his script's flimsy drivel, at best. Apparently none of his actors - and there are some good ones (William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and Brendon Gleeson) - bothered to point out the script's weak construction and incredible banality.I don't mind Shyamalan taking an hour or so to set up his story. But did that hour have to be so tedious and not contain anything truly unnerving? He's a one-trick pony and proves it, yet again. Everyone knows his movies have a major twist at the end. That's all there is to his work and he lacks the courage to change. Then again, why should he if audiences keep admiring his work not realizing it's the same, stale formula over and over again?He aims to prey on our fear of the unknown, to evoke eeriness much in the vein of Hitchcock or Henri-Georges Clouzot. Great idea. But Shyamalan's become so obvious, there's little point in our investing anything in his characters. Why should we? We know what's coming. Hitchcock and Clouzot toyed with our feelings and emotions; they gave us stories and monsters to believe in and we bought into their premises. Their films were genuinely creepy and suspenseful.Shyamalan's found a formula that worked in 'The Sixth Sense' - I wasn't a huge fan of the film, but it showed promise - and now simply retreads the same tired blueprint that essentially destroys any suspense in his stories.Here, he telegraphs the twist so early, you'd be hard-pressed not to figure it out. Even if you don't, it's so terribly ho-hum you're astonished he's that shallow and unoriginal a writer. There's his customary cameo, a la Hitchcock, and Shyamalan even gives himself a line of dialogue to justify his story's horrendously hokey premise.Young Bryce Dallas Howard brings an honesty to her performance that, frankly, is unwarranted and wasted in this movie. Don't spend much time thinking about Brody's character. He completely defies logic.The true mystery here is what possessed Hurt, Weaver and Gleeson to star in this film. Hurt does his best somnambulist impression, while Weaver and Gleeson get to do nothing substantial. Extras could have played their roles without diminishing the film any.'The Village' contains nothing spine-chilling or suspenseful anywhere. There's one honestly surprising moment - not frightening, but dramatic and well executed. Another scene promised much, but Shyamalan doesn't have faith in his actors to let it to linger a few seconds longer. It's a shame because Howard's vulnerability hooked us. Shyamalan deflates the moment by cutting away too early, promptly pumping up the overwrought violin score and resorting to pretentious slow-motion photography.Shyamalan's teetering on being tagged a hack. I don't doubt he's a talented chap. But if he wants to prove he's a good suspense filmmaker, not someone who simply recycles a hackneyed formula, he'll have to make a scary film that doesn't rely on humdrum storytelling techniques and cheap tricks that have long since worn out their novelty.",2,1,7,4 August 2004
"I, Robot"," Lackluster blockbuster
","A dry, unimaginative and derivative futuristic thriller that, despite a running time of less than two hours, makes for laborious viewing.Scripted by Jeff Vintar (from his script, 'Hardwired') and Akiva Goldsman, 'I, Robot' borrows from Isaac Asimov and steals plenty from 'Men in Black,' 'The Terminator' films and 'Star Wars.' A fight sequence could very well have been an outtake from 'The Terminator' (1984), and an early chase sequence seems awfully reminiscent of Will Smith pursuing an alien in 'Men in Black' (1997).The landscape director Alex Proyas and his production designers create looks impressive, but there's nothing in the story to keep us hooked. This is simply another Will Smith vehicle. Again, he's a smart-talking, wisecracking cop, except the wisecracks aren't any good. And he's chasing robots, not aliens. The straight sidekick falls to poor Bridget Moynahan in a thankless, terribly underwritten part as robotic engineer cum shrink Susan Calvin, whose sole purpose is to be there when Smith's Del Spooner needs access to high-security areas. Also, I have no qualms about nudity in films, why exactly do we need to see shots of Smith and Moynahan showering?This is one of those films where when the hero needs to get into a secure area, there's someone there to help him. Even when it appears he might be foiled, voila, someone knows exactly how to get in through an area that isn't monitored.Moynahan and Smith generate no sparks. They fizzle when they should sizzle. With absolutely no chemistry between the stars, all we're left with are two good-looking actors spouting horrible dialogue.It's awfully hard to respect a film that actually revels in product-placement. As insidious as it is to blatantly place products in films, it's unconscionable that screenwriters would stoop so low to actually include product-placement in the dialogue. There are times 'I, Robot' feels like a commercial for Converse Shoes.I don't know if both Vintar and Goldsman should be faulted for the pedestrian plotting and dialogue, but this is hackwork. Goldsman might very well be the most over-rated screenwriter in Hollywood. He's prolific, but seems to pen clunkers - 'Silent Fall' (1994), 'The Client' (1994), 'Batman Forever' (1995), 'Batman & Robin' (1997), 'Practical Magic' (1998) and 'Lost in Space' (1998). True, he won an Oscar for adapting 'A Beautiful Mind' (2001), but that was an overpraised film and consider writers who should have won that year - Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clowes for 'Ghost World' or Rob Festinger and Todd Field for 'In the Bedroom.'The setting's Chicago 2035, but 'I, Robot' is a conventional cop film complete with the iconoclastic cop, his black commander, a smarmy entrepreneur, good scientist, and the pretty aide who works for the entrepreneur but helps out the hero. The film is heavy on CGI, but surprisingly devoid of novelty. Even the robots seem mundane.That Spooner is a black cop who's biased against robots should make for great drama. But Proyas cares not for irony or nuance in his characters. He's so wowed by the advanced technology that he and his writers forgot there was a human story. It's almost as if this is exactly what Asimov warned us about.",4,0,0,23 July 2004
The Alamo," Lumbering yawner
","Good grief, this is a dull film.Director John Lee Hancock, a Texan native, obviously wanted to create the most authentic film of 'The Alamo,' but in his attempt to be so reverential, he forgot that he had a story to tell. Along with two other screenwriters - Leslie Bohem and Oscar-winner Stephen Gaghan - Hancock created a film where none of the characters is all that interesting.Part of the problem is that none of the main characters is fleshed out. Be it Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), James Bowie (Jason Patric), Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) or William Travis (Patrick Wilson), every major character is thoroughly one-dimensional.Thornton's the only one who gets a role with some bite. But Crockett, too, is underwritten, and at the end of 137 minutes, we still know very little about the man. As for the others: Houston's essentially a cameo starring a well-known actor and Bowie seems to be in the film only because the real character happened to be at the Alamo for the 1836 standoff.Hancock's film runs about 25 minutes too long. There are too many peripheral moments that don't add up to anything much, including Bowie's dreary flashbacks and delusions. There's even a flashback within a flashback. Hancock seems so intent on getting the period details right, that he completely ignores that a film should first tell a good, compelling story. Yes, the story of the Alamo is such a tale, but this film slights all the major players by making them poorly written characters.The only exciting aspect of the entire film is the novel use of the Spydercam. This camera, hung on high wires and propelled by computer, swoops, swooshes and gives us aerial shots in lieu of cranes or choppers. It's used very effectively, especially in the battle scenes.This is a film you should watch on DVD or video with your finger on the fast-forward button so that you can zip past all the tedious stuff - and, believe me, there's plenty of it - and get to the well-done battle scenes. But the film lacks grit and, honestly, I couldn't have cared less about any of the people in 'The Alamo.'I have no doubt as to Hancock's earnest desire to make a factually correct film version of the events at the Alamo. But sincerity does not mean the film automatically will be good. This one's a lumbering, ponderous attempt to tell an exciting true story. It's no wonder this film was plagued with production problems and that Disney delayed its release by several months.",3,2,7,8 October 2004
The Patriot," What a waste of time
","Along with 'Battlefield Earth,' this is one of the worst films of 2000.The dialogue is downright hokey - 'Stay the course/I have run my course' - the acting is awful except for Chris Cooper and the film is nothing more than overwrought melodrama.Funny that it took a German to make a purely corny American film. There are moments in this film that are so cornball, it's hard to imagine the filmmakers were not laughing hysterically as they shot those sequences. For instance (SPOILER WARNING)... When Mel comes galloping along with the American flag his son was sewing to rally the forces; or the boy laying dead with the wooden gun his father had given him inches from his hand - please, this is supposed to be dramatic?",1,10,22,30 July 2000
Van Helsing," It's all about the special effects, nothing else
","'Van Helsing' opens with a highly entertaining black-and-white homage to the old Universal horror films. It's gloriously tongue-in-cheek, but, alas, only a tease, because the rest of the film fails to live up to the promise. The joy lasts only about six minutes or so. After that, the film turns into a noisy, boisterous, occasionally fun, special effects extravaganza.This is a monster film where none of the monsters is scary. In fact, there isn't a frightening or suspenseful moment anywhere in this film. Just a couple of standard shocks, that's all. Then again, these monsters - Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Frankenstein Monster - quit being scary long ago. Every time I saw the Frankenstein Monster in 'Van Helsing,' my mind flashed back to Peter Boyle getting his finger lit on fire by Gene Hackman in 'Young Frankenstein.' If only 'Van Helsing' had even an ounce of the humor of that classic. Director Sommers keeps things moving at a frenetic pace, from one action sequence to another. But the dialogue is awful and he really cares little about his characters. Instead, he seems captivated by the visual effects and, frankly, they can only take a movie so far. The vampire babies, which look more like gargoyles than bats, seem to be an amalgam of 'Aliens' and 'Gremlins.' The brides are fun, but they're certainly not as sexy or titillating as the three in Coppola's 'Bram Stoker's Dracula.' Granted, there's a gleefully campy sense to Richard Roxburgh's Dracula,
Sommers treats his story too seriously. This film should be played with tongue firmly planted in cheek. But, unfortunately, due to some truly bad dialogue, I found myself laughing when, I am certain, Sommers did not plan on eliciting laughs. There are some well-placed bits of humor - most of them courtesy of David Wenham. The good: a) Wenham providing delightful comic relief, proving how much better this film could have been had it adopted a lighter touch; b) Kate Beckinsale, her laughable accent notwithstanding, looking terrific in a bodice and knee-high boots; and c) Someone finally coming up with a line of dialogue to take care of the cinematic convention of the talking killer. And there's one funny throw-away line from an extra when Wenham sets off a tiny explosion in his lab.One huge problem is Alan Silvestri's headache-inducing musical score. Sommers cranks up the volume so loud that the score not only becomes a distraction, it's awfully annoying, too. The film runs about 25 minutes too long and Sommers just doesn't know when to end his film.After the film ended, the person I went with said, 'Well, it's better than 'The Matrix Revolutions.'' That's not saying much, but, I suppose it's something.",5,0,0,9 May 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," So this is what passes for comedy these days?
","The trouble with watching 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' is that you know Steve Carell is so much better than the awful material in this film. Because I've seen him be much funnier on 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.' Then again, he was working with some of the funniest writers on TV on that show and had the luxury of playing alongside the likes of Rob Corddry, Stephen Colbert and my pick for the funniest woman in America, Samantha Bee.What's most surprising about 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' is that it was co-written by Carell. It's the reason I went to see the film. And what a tremendous disappointment it turned out to be.Critics gushing over this film and tossing accolades at it must so starved of good, genuinely funny comedy, that they quickly to embrace anything with even a modicum of humor. The same critics who thought this year's terrible 'Fever Pitch' was funny stuff.But this is a one-joke film and the joke runs out of steam within 10 minutes. And from there on, the writers, Carell and Judd Apatow (who also directed this embarrassment), simply keep regurgitating the same joke over and over and over and over again. Notice how many times the opening visual joke gets played in one form or another throughout the film. It doesn't get funnier simply because you keep playing it again. I don't mind scatological humor, even juvenile laughs. But the jokes need to work. They need to be funny. They just aren't here.I sat there utterly bewildered during this film, wondering why on earth no one involved in this mess realized the film wasn't all that funny. Yes, it's sweet, at times. It tries to be heartwarming, too. But those things don't necessarily make the film good or funny.But Carell and Apatow's idea of great humor is to have a man film his derri√®re or have a couple of chaps toss back and forth why they think the other is gay. The trouble is their put-downs aren't even remotely funny in the least. They're juvenile in the worst manner.The film is riddled with interminable lulls where the story just doesn't move along. The film's sole saving grace is watching Catherine Keener try to rescue it with her inimitable charm. Unfortunately, she's not working with sub-par material; she's working with execrable material. Frankly, Keener could make the afternoon traffic report on radio sound interesting, and she does a brave, but, ultimately, wasted, attempt at trying to salvage this film.Wasting a talented actress of Keener's caliber on material like this is a travesty. You want to see Keener in a good film? Watch 'Being John Malkovich' (1999). Heck, even her small role in the Sydney Pollack political thriller, 'The Interpreter,' makes for better viewing than this awful picture.Carell's a funny man. A very funny man. I loved him in 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (2004) and his bit in 'Bruce Almighty' (2003). As he's proved so often, he's good as a supporting player. 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin' is his first shot as a leading man. He doesn't make a convincing one. And he won't. Not until he works with stronger, funnier scripts.This purported comedy not only doesn't have good laughs, it's also an utter bore.",1,9,20,5 December 2005
Jarhead," There's something happening here, what it is ain't exactly clear
","It is impossible to watch 'Jarhead' and not think about the current Gulf War. I realize the film takes place solely in the context of the first Gulf War, but you can't help but think about what's going on now.One of the most salient points this film makes - and I don't know if it was intentional - is a rather subtle one. Throughout 'Jarhead,' director Sam Mendes and screenwriter William Broyles Jr. point out how many days these soldiers have spent in the desert and how many of them there are. For much of the film - as we very well know from facts from the first war - they readied themselves for the invasion of Iraq. When it finally comes, there's a title imposed on the screen telling us there are 575,000 troops on the ground.I'm not a fan of President George H.W. Bush, but, at least, he knew how to properly carry out an invasion. He listened to his military commanders. Cut to Gulf War: Part Deux, run by his not-too-smart and incompetent kid, and you realize how incredibly botched and poorly planned this Iraq War was and is. We went in with fewer than 200,000 troops. Thanks, Dubya.The point of 'Jarhead' seems to be not that war is hell so much as that war can be downright boring, too. These are guys who are just itching to see some action, to blow some crap up. Instead, they're forced to wait, causing much frustration. In hindsight, of course, the waiting game seemed to make us better prepared. We, at least, seemed to have a plan then. And we didn't manufacture false WMD evidence or say that we needed regime change to oust a brutal dictator who, true, killed thousands, but was also one of our biggest allies and buddies when he did most of those killings, something no one in this administration or in the media ever points out.The trouble with 'Jarhead' is the soldiers' frustration can't really carry the whole film. Jake Gyllenhaal is awfully good as Anthony Swofford, waiting for his first sniper kill, and Peter Sarsgaard, again, turns in a wonderful low-key performance. This chap truly is fast becoming one of our finest film actors. But the rest of the cast, including Jamie Foxx and Dennis Haysbert, wind up in mostly throwaway roles. And many of the supporting characters seem cookie-cutter.The film delves into the daily grind of the soldiers and their commanders' plans to keep the boys busy while awaiting the invasion. It's all about doing something to prevent from going stir crazy. But I really don't know if it makes for captivating cinema.As beautifully shot, well acted and competently directed as 'Jarhead' is, there were many times I wondered why exactly Mendes wanted to make this movie. If his point, indeed, was that war is boring, that is made abundantly clear early on. But there needs to be something more to a movie, too, and this one just didn't have it.I'm glad I saw this movie, but I wanted more. I didn't want to be as bored as the soldiers were and, often, that's exactly how I found myself.",6,0,1,7 December 2005
Collateral," Mann, what a crime! 'Collateral' comes apart with wimpy, formulaic climax
","[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]After making one of the dullest biopics in recent memory, 'Ali' (2001), director Michael Mann returns to his crime-drama roots in 'Collateral,' looking to rekindle some of the brilliance of his last thriller, 'Heat' (1995).Unfortunately, 'Collateral' is no 'Heat.'Despite an eye-opening dramatic turn by former stand-up comic, Jamie Foxx, 'Collateral' promises much, but doesn't quite live up to its potential.Mann's thrillers take time to unfold. He revels delving into aspects of characters' lives rarely, if ever, seen in the fast-paced world of Hollywood crime dramas. That's what made 'Thief' (1981), 'Manhunter' (1986) and 'Heat' such good films.His films also take place in a visually stylized urban milieu. Mann's films may be noirish, but his asphalt jungle is sleek, glossy; its inhabitants slick, urbane, even though some of them might very well be slimeballs. Here, Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron's striking cinematography makes nighttime Los Angeles look sexy.The premise of 'Collateral' is basic: Cabbie Max (Foxx) gets unwittingly engaged for the night by Vincent (Tom Cruise), a hit man with five targets in one night. But 'Collateral' feels like two disparate films. On the one hand, there's the intriguing mind game between Vincent and Max. Their conversations are thoughtful and utterly convincing. They develop an almost morally uncomfortable intimacy. On the other hand, there's everything else in the film.Mann's films usually give us interesting supporting characters we get to know well. That's not the case with 'Collateral.' There's one splendid supporting role - a jazz club owner played superbly by Barry Shabaka Henley, who was the best thing in Spielberg's 'The Terminal,' earlier this year.But there aren't many moments like this in 'Collateral.' Instead, we get entirely forgettable supporting characters, including two police detectives, played by Mark Ruffalo and Peter Berg. They're worked into a superfluous subplot and given the film's most stilted dialogue. Excising them would have cost nothing.'Collateral' begins promisingly. Before Vincent hops in the cab, Max picks up Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). They flirt, talk about their lives, their dreams. The dialogue flows well, there's believable chemistry giving scene a pleasing rhythm.Cruise and Foxx hold this film together. Villains always are more interesting than heroes and Cruise, playing against type, almost pulls off the killer without a conscience, someone Jeff Bailey might have referred to as 'awfully cold around the heart.' Foxx proves he's not to be pigeonholed as a comedian and turns in a surprisingly good performance.Where this film fails miserably is in its plotting.With most other filmmakers, we could anticipate who Vincent's final target will be. But since this is a Michael Mann film, we expect something different. And this is where he disappoints. He sticks rigidly to formula and gives us exactly the gutless denouement we'd expect to see in any other conventional thriller. Mann and writer Stuart Beattie create scenes that begin fascinatingly, but end hackneyed. There's a traffic stop that builds slowly and intensely, only to conclude with one of the most overused cinematic clich√©s.Any sense of reality gets obliterated in the final act, starting with the Felix scene. And there's an unbelievable nightclub sequence that could only take place in the movies. Apparently in LA, people will continue dancing even if the person next to them has his neck snapped by an assassin and gunfire erupts in the club.Then there's the ending, complete with a cell phone that's running out of power, a victim who waits too late to call 9-1-1 and the requisite foot chase. It seems so horribly tacked on, not what we expect from Mann. 'Collateral' isn't necessarily bad. Given the talent involved, it's merely one of the huge disappointments of the year.",6,0,0,9 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The darkest of the bunch...and the best, so far
","(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS)Amazing what happens to a franchise when a talented director takes over. Instead of a Hollywood hack taking the directorial reins yet again, this time the film was given to Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuar√≥n, whose films include the brilliant 'Y tu mam√° tambi√©n' (2001) and the under-rated 'A Little Princess' (1995).What refreshing about 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' is that Cuar√≥n does not dumb down the story. As Harry and his friends mature, so does the story.The film begins with the customary scene at the Dursleys, where the story stretches to get laughs. But then the film takes a good turn when Harry leaves his relatives' home and Cuar√≥n laces the rest of the story with a sense of dread throughout. Even the game of quiddich, which thankfully is brief, no longer has that playful, colorful aura about it. This time it occurs during a rainstorm and remains dark and dangerous.Hogwarts, too, has changed. For the better. Now, you get the feeling that danger lurks everywhere, that something terrible might indeed happen when we least expect it. And that's the fun of this film.The three main actors - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint - have matured well, though I doubt they'll be around for Harry Potter's seventh installment. They might look too old for the parts then. But, for now, they're fine. The surprise is young Miss Watson, who is blossoming into a terrific actress. Her Hermione has spunk and proves a fine role model. It's fun watching Miss Watson take control of her scenes. Once she's done with the Harry Potter series, there's little doubt a rewarding acting career as an adult awaits her.The supporting cast does a fine job, too. Michael Gambon slips nicely into the role of Albus Dumbledore and David Thewlis (as Lupin) always is fun to watch. Gary Oldman relishes every moment on screen as Sirius Black, but it's a pity we don't see enough of him. In fact, the same could be said of the great Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman (surely screenwriter Steve Kloves, who is one of the best in the business - if you doubt it, see 'Flesh and Bone' and 'The Fabulous Baker Boys' - could give Prof. Severus Snape more scenes.), Emma Thompson and Julie Christie, whose appearance is too brief for such a radiant actress.Some scenes seem superfluous, especially a CGI werewolf-wolf battle that seems to be from another movie. This must be the year for computer-generated wolves - we've seen them in 'Van Helsing,' 'The Day After Tomorrow' and now this film. The scene isn't needed because it comes at a time when the plot should focus more on Sirius. Though I liked the CGI tree, especially when it shakes off some snow and the snow hits the camera lens.'Harry Potter' is an international phenomenon and it matters little what critics say. J.K. Rowling should be commended for creating characters that children (and adults) the world over adore. And anyone who can get kids nowadays to read a 1,000-page book deserves to be championed.Cuar√≥n was ideal for this film. He's taken a mature approach to the story and gives us a beautiful, entertaining and enjoyable film. It might be a bit too dark for very young children, but anyone older than 12 should thoroughly enjoy this film. Under Cuar√≥n's direction, the film is creepier, more sinister, sophisticated and fresh. And that's always a good thing.",8,1,2,9 June 2004
Mamma Mia!," Take a chance ... just for the sheer fun of it
","As gratifying as it is for me to see, say, a deeply meaningful foreign-language or independent film about the nature of man or the fundamental questions of life, there is something to be said about seeing a movie that makes absolutely no pretensions about what it is.'Mamma Mia!' is made for the sheer fun of it all. True, it is banking on the immense popularity of the stage musical, which I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed. (For the sake of full disclosure, I grew up an ABBA fan. You couldn't turn on the radio from the mid-1970s to the very early '80s without hearing one of their songs.)I am giving away no secrets here - the plot of 'Mamma Mia! is flimsy at best. If you can call it a plot, that is. The basic premise - a young girl trying to find out who her real dad is on the eve of her wedding - is merely an excuse to string along a whole number of ABBA songs. It was so in the stage musical and it is the same in the movie.The film relies on the charm of the songs - let's face it, ABBA was a genius at linking simple lyrics to catchy tunes. And once their songs get into your head, it's awfully difficult to get rid of them. Try listening to 'Dancing Queen,' 'Take a Chance on Me,' 'Waterloo' or 'Mamma Mia!' on the radio without finding yourself humming the tune or singing the song just minutes later.The film takes a bit to get going. But it does settle down after the initial screech-fests when Sophie's two friends and Donna's two friends are introduced. The film's thin plot unwinds and all the actors gamely throw themselves lustily into the musical.What surprised me about the movie was the filmmakers managed to find some pathos, some real emotion, if you will, in the midst of this disco nostalgia. Much of the credit goes to Meryl Streep, who carries this film. She brings such exuberance to her role that it's downright impossible not to be utterly charmed by her Donna. She is a marvel here and her rendition of 'The Winner Takes It All' had some women in the audience reaching for their tissues at the screening I attended. Streep knows how to belt it and her take on the song is as emotionally potent as it was when Agnetha first sang the number in the waning days of the musical group.The rest of the cast is good, too, though with their shortfalls. Pierce Brosnan singing 'S.O.S.' might be the cringe-inducing moment of the year. But I suppose it's forgivable to look beyond his vocal shortfall because the others make up for it and the music takes you along for a wonderful ride. Stellan Skarsgard clearly is having fun and if you ever had any questions about his talent, watch his reaction when he speaks to Sophie during 'Gimme, Gimme, Gimme.' That alone might be worth the price of admission. Though his vocal talents might be on par with Mr. Brosnan. Christine Baranski is a fine comedic actress - and the role is tailor-made for her - and a sensationally good singer. She brings so much sass to her role, I couldn't really envision anyone else in it - okay, Bebe Neuwirth perhaps - and winds up having the best musical scene in the movie. If her number on the beach doesn't get you toe-tapping, I suppose nothing will.Christine Johnson's screenplay doesn't exactly sizzle; her dialogue serves as mere transitions to the next song. But you aren't really going to see this movie for its crackling dialogue, are you? The film also would have benefited from more inventive choreography, especially during the initial moments of Streep's rendition of 'Mamma Mia!' While watching 'Mamma Mia!' it occurred to me that I was actually having fun. That's one of the wonders of movies and certainly is one of the film's many charms. Sometimes it's refreshing to sit in a darkened theatre and just have fun watching a movie. I have no doubt ABBA fans will love this film. But others should enjoy it as well because it actually is a surprisingly engaging piece of entertainment. True, it's silly popcorn entertainment. But given how much mediocre stuff Hollywood puts out yearly, it is nice to have some truly entertaining, goofy fluff. Frankly, the last time I had this much fun watching a movie was Shane Black's 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' (2005).",8,5,8,12 July 2008
Before Sunset," Restores my faith in American cinema
","It's been nine years since Jesse and Celine kissed and parted ways at that train station in Vienna, vowing to meet again in six months.
Director Richard Linklater's premise for the sequel to his delightful 1995 film, 'Before Sunrise,' is simple: Jesse's now an author pimping his book in Europe, while Celine's making the world better in Paris. As chance would have it - or, is it truly chance? - Jesse's signing books at Celine's favorite Parisian bookstore.Linklater and his actors, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, take us on an indisputably charming, funny and poignant journey as Jesse and Celine reconnect in the few moments Jesse has before flying home to the U.S.
Hawke and Delpy are now nine years older and it shows. After Linklater lets us glimpse the younger Jesse and Celine in a few quick flashbacks from 'Before Sunrise,' we realize Hawke's marital problems seem to have taken their toll and Delpy might have lost that celestial loveliness, but still looks beautiful.And like Jesse and Celine, we, too, have grown older, though not necessarily wiser. Jesse's edgier; Celine's slightly more neurotic. These days, their views on life, love and the world might not be as Panglossian as before, but more rooted in reality.'Before Sunset' is all about the what-ifs in life, something most, if not all, of us can identify with. And about getting a second chance at correcting a mistake.Linklater shoots Jesse and Celine's stroll through Paris in lengthy, unobtrusive takes. Hawke and Delpy are so relaxed in their roles and with each other that we easily believe they're two soul mates seeing other again for the first time in nine years.Hawke and Delpy might have helped write the script, but several moments seem improvised. There's the initial awkwardness as Jesse and Celine skirt around what they really want to know about each other. Then, as they invade each other's personal space, the emotional walls come down. They chat about their lives, loves, coincidences that well might have led to something else for both of them. Both actors are sensationally good in this picture. This might very well be Hawke's finest performance. He and Delpy have terrific chemistry; their emotions are genuine; they play off each other as if they're two old friends awfully comfortable in each other's presence. And the writing's authentic, especially during two scenes - on a water-taxi and, later, in a SUV. There's nothing about this film that rings false. And just when we're wondering how Linklater will end the story this time, he produces a sublime conclusion to a masterful, magnificent movie.",9,0,0,4 August 2004
Hero," Beautiful film, ugly propaganda
","[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' possesses some of the most gorgeous sequences I've seen on screen in a long, long time. It's a visual feast that often awes you with its beauty.'The Spider's Stratagem' (1970) boasts possibly the most dazzling display of color in a film in the last 40 years. In 'Hero,' Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle comes close to emulating what Vittorio Storaro did for Bernardo Bertolucci.With nods to Akira Kurosawa and, a lesser extent, Sergio Leone, Zhang unravels 'Hero' methodically as the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) starts to take apart Nameless' (Jet Li) claims of vanquishing three assassins - Lone Sky (Donnie Yen), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). Each of Nameless' stories and Qin's interpretations are brought gloriously to life with some spectacular display of martial arts and brilliant use of color.Two sequences in particular are thrilling - a swordfight among autumn leaves between Flying Snow and Moon (Zhang Ziyi) bathed in yellow and red as leaves whirl like tornadoes and people sail through the air; and a duel over a lake with Nameless and Broken Sword gliding across the water, their feet skirting the surface, their swords occasionally piercing the lake as if they were calligraphy brushes drawing intricate designs on the water. Wuxia films have been around for decades, but the supernatural martial arts were made popular in the U.S. by Ang Lee's 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' (2000), which set the standard as far as American multiplex audiences are concerned. Wong Kar-wai, Lee and Zhang Yimou are doing to wuxia what Sam Peckinpah and, later, the likes of John Woo and Ringo Lam did to gunplay.Its vibrant, rich palette notwithstanding, I wasn't as entranced by Zhang's film as I was with Lee's Oscar-winner. The pacing's a bit too slow and you get the impression Zhang's trying to outdo Lee by taking wuxia to new heights. Which poses a bit of a problem. Zhang's fight scenes are choreographed so fantastically, he runs the risk of them losing their charm, not to mention believability. Suspension of disbelief has its limits and Zhang's inching terribly close to the edge in 'Hero.' We're too aware of the technical aspect of it all - the digitally excised wires, over-reliance on CGI and, of course, excessive use of slow-motion photography. At least three-fourths of the film is in slow motion. More of this and the magic of wuxia will soon plummet from the fantastically splendid to the laughably ridiculous.And despite all its beauty, 'Hero' leaves an awfully rancid taste in the mouth, especially when the true meaning of the film's title and the movie's central message become abundantly clear. The final titles scroll exalting the titular character's brave act and Qin's greatness as a unifier. And you realize exactly why 'Hero' comes to us with the blessings of China's current rulers.I have no problem with nationalistic themes in films. And the idea of self-sacrifice has been explored in every film genre. But considering whom Zhang is talking about, his argument is vapid. He's venturing into Leni Riefenstahl territory here. At least, we knew her movies were propaganda.The trouble is Zhang's not trying to be ironic here. He's plainly kowtowing to the Chinese leaders. He's turned from a bold, courageous filmmaker who made provocative and defiantly daring films - 'Ju Dou' (1990), 'Raise the Red Lantern' (1991), 'To Live' (1994) - to an artistic and artful propagandist for a ruthless regime. Through his protagonist Nameless, Zhang seems to argue that Chinese unity is a noble cause no matter who has to suffer. Zhang's arrogant to so blindly tout national unity, not when China, under the guise of that national unity, brutally oppresses Tibetans, stifles democracy in Hong Kong, threatens Taiwan with missiles, imprisons dissidents, massacres its own people at Tiananmen Square. Zhang's jingoistic call for unity, unity, always unity is na√Øve at best, repugnant at worst.Imagine the exact story set in a Taliban-led Afghanistan. In Pol Pot's Cambodia. Or, in 1930s Germany and the filmmaker embracing the 'greatness' of the Third Reich and Hitler's desire to unify the Fatherland. That's when bile rises, when I get that acrid taste in my mouth and sickening feeling in my stomach.",6,2,4,30 August 2004
The Hurt Locker," Taut, exciting, thrilling - one of the year's best
","I can now forgive Kathryn Bigelow for making 'Strange Days' (1995). Legions love that sci-fi film, but I found it to be an unpleasant experience.She certainly has redeemed herself with 'The Hurt Locker,' a taut, thrilling, at times suspenseful film about a group of soldiers who risk their lives trying to defuse Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Iraq. This is a thinking man's action film.I believe the reason 'The Hurt Locker' will do better than the other Iraq War films - 2006's 'Home of the Brave' and 2007's 'Redacted,' 'In the Valley of Elah,' 'The Situation,' 'Grace Is Gone,' 'Lions for Lambs' and 'Battle for Haditha' - is because you can't quite pinpoint the film's politics. And that tends to go over better with American audiences, who apparently cared not that their government leaders lied to them or didn't wish to be reminded that they were lied to or felt there was too much war saturation on cable news. Also, many of the films so far about the Iraq War haven't been very good, though I do believe 'Battle for Haditha' is superb. It's just that next to no one saw Nick Broomfield's wonderful film.The thing about Bigelow's terrific film is that it really doesn't need to display its politics. I don't have the foggiest idea whether Bigelow supported or disagreed with George W. Bush's invasion and occupation of Iraq, but the filmmaker's take on the war is not needed here. Because this is a film about soldiers who like to stop things from going 'Boom!' and you get the feeling that Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) would be just as happy defusing these things in Los Angeles, Des Moines or anywhere else. It just so happens that Iraq is where action is, where he gets his adrenaline rush.'The Hurt Locker' is a nerve-wracking thriller, held together by a brilliant performance by Renner - he truly deserves a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for this - and some sensationally choreographed sequences. Mark Boal's tight and lean script - he also wrote 'In the Valley of Elah,' which was a bit more on the preachy side - helps immensely, but Bigelow and editors Chris Innis and Bob Murawski know exactly how to wring the most suspense out of small moments. (Of course, Innis and Murawski had plenty of footage to choose from given that Bigelow chose to shoot four hand-held cameras simultaneously, a strategy that certainly helps actors and works perfectly for this film.)The best of these moments is a lengthy sequence in the desert involving snipers. I had problems with some moments in this sequence - the gun jamming, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) being unable to hit a stationary target, but then nails the target when the Iraqi is running - but Bigelow turns the screws so slowly that you being feeling as antsy as the soldiers as we see flies land on James and Sanborn as they wait patiently. What makes this scene work is that Bigelow refrains from using any overblown musical score to heighten the tension. Instead, she is smart enough to know - and I wish other action and suspense directors will take a cue from her - that the situation is tense enough and that she can draw the viewer in by calmly prolonging the sequence and preying on our anxiousness to ratchet up the suspense. There's another moment involving an impetuous taxi driver and, here again, Bigelow squeezes every drop of suspense.Renner's James is at the core of this film. He's cocky, brash and even arrogant, though not in the same way that made some of John Wayne's characters unbelievable. Renner's James has the same sort of bravado Wayne's characters sometimes did, but there's something beautifully authentic about Renner's performance.He's a terrific actor - thank you ABC for proving you know nothing about good TV and canceling the series, 'The Unusuals,' in which Renner was awfully good - and you can sense the wheels turning in his head as he balances James' action junkie with the cool precision of a fine craftsman disassembling bombs. There is something creepy about Renner's coolness here. He gets fine supporting performances from Mackie and Brian Geraghty, both of whom try to make sense of this man James as the film is told through their eyes.The film is not without its flaws. A vigilante moment in a subplot involving a young Iraqi boy who befriends James seemed a superfluous attempt to make him seem more heroic, and there were times I seriously questioned the bombers' motivations or rationale for why they did or didn't do certain things.'The Hurt Locker' could be viewed by some as a paean to America's derring do spirit. I am not entirely sure that is Bigelow's aim. She and Boal do raise some interesting questions: Yes, these chaps are courageous, but at what price? What is this addiction to this action and what are its consequences?If you are expecting a wham-bam action film, you will be disappointed. 'The Hurt Locker' is essentially a character study set in a war zone. It just happens to be a damn fine character study of obsessive people.The film opens with Chris Hedges' assertion that war is a drug, an addiction, and then Bigelow goes to prove that point with James. This is his job. Then again, for James, it's not just a job, it is an adventure and watching Renner bring James to life makes you understand his character, though you might not quite appreciate some of the decisions he makes.",8,2,5,29 July 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood is a national treasure
","At first glance, 'Million Dollar Baby' seems like it should be pedestrian fare. An aging boxing trainer and his old sidekick take in a poor white girl who dreams of becoming a champ and, together, they work to get to the top. It's the sort of pulpy stuff the likes of Jim Thompson and Charles Willeford might have reveled in.So why does 'Million Dollar Baby' work? One reason: Clint Eastwood.At 75, Eastwood might very well be the best American filmmaker working today. A true auteur, it's evident of his amazing talent that he's taken a generally conventional story and turned it into a rich, deep, insightful character study.As for conservatives enraged by the film: Get real. They're all for promoting free thought and expression so long as it doesn't differ from what they believe, their worldview. 'Million Dollar Baby' is a movie. What the characters do, the decisions they make fit with what makes the story work.There's no great conspiracy or agenda at work. It's good storytelling and conservative hosts should worry more about having an administration that fabricates evidence and seems quite keen on stifling due process and expression in the name of security. Now, that's a frightening agenda.What propels 'Million Dollar Baby' are three spectacular performances. Hilary Swank, as the young wannabe champ Maggie Fitzgerald, proves beyond any doubt that her Best Actress Oscar for 'Boys Don't Cry' (1999) was no fluke. She imbues Maggie with grit, determination and courage; and when the story requires her to change focus, she makes Maggie vulnerable without ever making her weak. After watching Swank in this film, you'll understand why she's winning all the awards for her performance.Eastwood as the trainer Frankie Dunn and Morgan Freeman as his assistant Eddie Dupris rarely have been better. Not only is he a great filmmaker, Eastwood's also turned into a fine actor. Frankie, like many of Eastwood characters, is a man of few words. He struggles with his own dilemmas and remains emotionally distant. Yet, there's real depth of feeling in Eastwood's portrayal. He conveys more genuine emotion with his craggy, weathered face than most actors can with superb dialogue and Actor's Studio training.Watching Eastwood and Freeman work together is a treat. There's tremendous chemistry between them. They play off each other with supreme ease like an old couple very familiar with each other's idiosyncrasies. They're good friends, old pros whose riffs go down smoothly like a glass of great scotch.Despite directing many films, Eastwood always was known primarily as an actor. But in the last several years, he has emerged as one of America's great filmmakers with work such as 'Unforgiven' (1992) and 'Mystic River' (2003). Heck, Eastwood even turned that horrible novel, 'The Bridges of Madison County,' into a good film in 1995.True, 'Million Dollar Baby' works with numerous cinematic clich√©s. But Eastwood still creates visual poetry, from his choice of camera angles to eliciting tender, effective and moving performances, from his superb use of his own musical score to creating the perfect mood.The film's flaw perhaps is the over-use of Freeman's voice-over narration. Telling an audience what to think, how to feel, the real emotion of a particular moment are something the actors must convey through their performances; Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis shouldn't have to rely on narration. Narration is an easy way for screenwriters to cheat and, more often than not, I got the feeling that's exactly what Haggis was doing.Freeman's voice isn't the issue here. That's amazing. But, at times, his narration is obtrusive. The reason for the narration's made clear at the end, but I wish Eastwood had limited its use, that he'd used it as cleverly as he did his music.Nevertheless, 'Million Dollar Baby' remains touching, funny, poignant, powerful. It's a superbly acted film made by a master craftsman.",7,1,2,16 February 2005
Garden State," Portman sparkles in Braff's offbeat charmer
","[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]In a recent Washington Post online chat, writer/director/actor Zach Braff said Natalie Portman called her agent soon after meeting with Braff and announced she wanted to do this movie. After seeing it, I understand why.This is Portman's finest adult role and her juiciest part since Marty in 'Beautiful Girls' (1996). In 'Garden State,' she enchants us with a performance that should, though likely won't, garner her a supporting actress Oscar nomination. Oh, if only she didn't make those wretched 'Star Wars' movies.Portman captures Sam's every nuance, turning her into a complex, intelligent, delightfully weird young woman. When Sam laughs, our world brightens; when she cries, our hearts shatter. Sam is the core of this film and Portman holds together the story and our attention with a gem of a performance. Watch Portman in just two scenes - in front of a fireplace and at the bottom of a flight of steps - and you'll see why this remarkable actress is in a wholly different class than her contemporaries.Braff's Andrew 'Large' Largeman is a far departure from his J.D. on TV's funniest sitcom, 'Scrubs.' Large's appeal comes from Braff wryly underplaying him, never allowing his scenes to become overwrought. Even an emotionally pivotal moment in a bathtub concludes beautifully with a clever comedic touch involving a paper cup.Peter Sarsgaard gently transforms Large's friend Mark from somewhat of a jerk to a generous, real person. Sarsgaard's a gifted actor with an uncanny ability to give great depth to his characters with minute gestures and expressions.Along with a bouncy soundtrack, the film boasts truly inspired moments. Despite working within the basic framework of romantic-comedies, Braff creates something oddly amusing and memorable in almost every situation, be it the opening shot of Large in bed, a lovely moment in Sam's backyard or a visit to a construction site. He also devises one of the more novel meet-cutes in a romantic-comedy and lets Portman's natural radiance make that moment shine.As a writer and director, Braff finds a deft balance between quirky comedy and poignant drama. He never hurries his story and shows a splendid eye for detail. From a stuck gas pump nozzle to automatic faucets in an airport restroom to dusted fingerprints on the TV set in Sam's living room to Mark's mother's boyfriend, Braff smartly allows the moments' eccentricities play out without drawing attention to the details.Not that 'Garden State' is flawless. Braff occasionally tries too hard to be wacky and also loses his way in the last 10 minutes. The awfully conventional ending seems tacked on, like an afterthought, as if Braff suddenly felt the need to adhere to some screenwriting guru/hack's rules on how a movie should end. Given Large and Sam's budding relationship and states of mind, a less formulaic denouement would've been more convincing, fitted the tone of the film better. Braff, admittedly a Woody Allen fan, perhaps should have heeded Tracy's climactic words of wisdom in 'Manhattan' - 'You have to have a little faith in people.'There's little doubt Braff's a gifted storyteller. 'Garden State' is one of the most assured directing debuts in years. Braff needs to learn how to tighten his stories a bit and have the courage to be slightly more atypical. But this is a sensationally good start to what should be a thoroughly promising and rewarding filmmaking career. I eagerly await his next work.",8,0,1,27 August 2004
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," An important allegory for modern times
","Expertly directed, superbly crafted and well acted, 'Good Night, and Good Luck' is as much an allegory about what's going on today regarding civil liberties as it is about journalist Edward R. Murrow's fight against Sen. Joseph McCarthy's communist witch hunt in the 1950s.George Clooney and Grant Heslov have crafted an engrossing story that - in this day and age - dares us to recognize the importance of questioning our leaders; that doing that is not only ethical, moral and responsible, but also patriotic.The film masterfully transports us to a time and place when HUAC frightened Americans and politicians and the courts were too fearful to take on McCarthyism. (Funny, isn't it, that a simple query from Joseph Welch - 'Have you no sense of decency?' - finally exposed McCarthy for who he was.) Journalists and producers of the caliber of Murrow and Fred Friendly are rare these days, if not extinct. Today, we have an administration (aided by a bullying 'news' channel) that questions the patriotism of anyone who criticizes its decisions or policies and vulgarly suggests its critics give succor to the enemy. After all, just see what our leaders named the anti-terrorism law after 9/11. Who would dare vote against something called the Patriot Act? We have leaders who consider the Geneva Conventions antiquated, have no qualms about torturing prisoners or shredding the Bill of Rights.And, instead of Murrow-like dogged journalists, we are inundated with sycophantic, gutless reporters cowed by our leaders, simply buying into any malarkey fed to them by elected officials and bureaucrats. I'm sorry, but the New York Times' and Washington Post's apologies that they did a lousy job in the lead up to the Iraq War doesn't absolve them of their shame. Imagine what the last two years might have been like had our journalists done their job and questioned claims of WMD, being welcomed as liberators and other crucial issues.Clooney's film is studded with brilliant performances, starting with David Strathairn as Murrow. Just as Chris Cooper was finally recognized by Oscar - for 'Adaptation' (2002) - perhaps the always wonderful Strathairn also will be honored soon.Also, look for a wonderful turn by Ray Wise as Don Hollenbeck. With all the accolades going to Clooney and Strathairn, it's easy to forget Wise's beautiful, understated performance.Filming this in black and white was a bold move; color would have spoiled it. Also, it was a very wise decision to use real footage of McCarthy, as opposed to having someone play him. What Clooney and Heslov do effectively is make us realize through a 1950s event what exactly is happening today. It's akin to Andrzej Wajda using the 1793 drama, 'Danton' (1983) to expose Polish politics in the Soviet era.It's easy for leaders to simply justify their questionable behavior and policies by hiding behind the excuse that they can do anything because we're at war. They prey on our (rather obscene) obsession with patriotism to further their fear-mongering.This film shows that occasionally a few strong, principled, brave, patriotic people stand up to say no against all odds. And they're right. If only we had similar examples in our media to point to today.",8,1,2,22 December 2005
Shrek 2," The novelty's worn off a bit, but this is still pretty good
","The novelty of 'Shrek' has worn off a bit this time, but 'Shrek 2' still delivers plenty of laughs. And I'm thrilled that Disney still gets skewered. I don't understand why people feel those animated films shouldn't be ridiculed. 'Shrek 2' takes a while to get cranking - maybe we're spoiled because the original was a clever send-up from the beginning. The opening's a bit too mellow this time. But once Puss-in-Boots (voiced wonderfully by Antonio Banderas) appears on the scene, 'Shrek 2' turns into a thrilling story.Kids will no doubt love the slapstick humor and fart jokes, but there's plenty in 'Shrek 2' to keep adults laughing, too. Granted, even some older teens might not get some of the post-modern references - there are riffs on 'From Here to Eternity,' 'Flashdance' (it's very funny), 'The Fabulous Baker Boys,' 'Ghostbusters' and 'Alien.' The film pokes fun of Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' and even takes shots at Disney World's penchant for spotless sidewalks and streets. And just see what happens to the Little Mermaid!There are some priceless moments in this film. The scene where Pinocchio's truth is revealed is hysterically funny and there's some mild adult humor tossed in for good measure in a scene involving three maidens.
The film occasionally strains when it tries being a bit too clever and the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming aren't as funny as they could be.But at a time when Disney churns out tiresome animated films, it's good to know there's 'Shrek 2' not only giving Disney a well-deserved send-up, but also providing solid animated entertainment that doesn't insult the intelligence of adults.",7,0,0,24 May 2004
World Trade Center," National tragedy as formula storytelling
","Something surprising happened while watching Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center' - I realized how much more I appreciated Paul Greengrass' 'United 93.' Greengrass' film was lean, stripped of any backstory for any of the characters. Very simply, it told what happened that horrible day on the plane - though he used some license - and didn't wallow in needless sentimentality.Stone, on the other hand and rather surprisingly, seems to have gone out of his way to make something that would be so palatable and inoffensive that it would turn out rather bland, above anything else.The 45 minutes of 'World Trade Center' are terrific. After offering us quick glimpses into the lives of Port Authority cops John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), Andrea Berloff's script gets us right into the attacks on the Twin Towers.The crumbling of the towers, which still is incredibly difficult to watch, let alone fathom, is handled with taste, but also is awfully gripping. We get a real sense of the terror and panic and then Stone gets the claustrophobic atmosphere right. With close-ups of Pena and Cage amidst the ruins, he gets us so close, we can almost taste the rubble and concrete dust.But that's the last time we really see or feel any sense of genuine, gripping storytelling in this film. I realize criticizing a film about 9/11, especially one that displays its American stars and stripes so blatantly, is tantamount to treason these days. After all, as this administration and its minions love to point out, if you disagree with them, you're not only unpatriotic, but also an appeaser of the villains. It's poppycock, of course. Dissent is undoubtedly American, but these chaps so love draping themselves in the flag that jingoism overwhelms all reason. Why bother with rational thought when you can scare people?What struck me while watching the film is realizing how much goodwill was channeled toward the United States after the attacks and what's ultimately sad is how this president took all that goodwill and squandered it by launching an utterly pointless war in Iraq. We could have done so much good in the world, instead of now being one of the most hated nations in the world. And Bush has now turned 9/11 into a political slogan for political (and personal) gain.The problem with Stone's film isn't so much the story, but how Berloff chose to tell it. According to Berloff, cops, rescue workers, even family members tend to enjoy speaking in exposition. There are moments that surely someone of Stone's calibre should have realized needed to be rewritten because the dialogue seems mediocre at best.Where the film suffers is when the story cuts between the two trapped men and their families, especially their wives. Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and the always wonderful Maggie Gyllenhaal as Allison Jimeno never get much to do with their sorely underwritten roles. It's a true testament to Gyllenhaal's talent that she turns a rather sour role into a passionate, moving performance. Poor Bello, on the other hand, isn't that fortunate. She's relegated to spending more time than she should weeping.The trouble with these scenes is not that Berloff tries to wring some emotion out of them, but that they come off as unabashedly sentimental. And the emotions are entirely unearned.Pena proves, just as he did in 'Crash' (2005), that he's able to be something special on screen. His character is far more engaging than Cage's; Pena's emotions come off without any artifice.I can't help but feel that 'World Trade Center' could have been the gut-wrenching experience Stone intended it to be had he and Berloff approached the story much in the way Greengrass did 'United 93.' Stone's movie is far from lean. It's padded with needless sentimentality and moments that just try so hard to earn some emotion, any emotion, that they come off as utterly false. And that's unfair to the people whose story is being chronicled here.Watching Cage and Pena trapped should be gripping stuff. But even their dialogue is reduced to exposition. And when Berloff finally leaves the two men and their families, we get Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a man so moved by what he saw that he came down to the Twin Towers and proved to be McLoughlin and Jimeno's miracle. We all know Karnes is a real person, but I very much doubt that he speaks in bumper stickers. But that's exactly what Berloff has him do.The first 45 minutes of the movie showed what Stone truly is capable of doing. The rest is rather tepid. And unbelievably forced. Who knew that Oliver Stone, of all people, would resort to formulaic storytelling. Perhaps he's been so stung by conspiracy accusations and was so keen on appeasing his critics and forgetting the execrable 'Alexander' (2004) that he opted to make the kind of movie Ron Howard would make. That's not a compliment.",5,131,220,2 September 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Unforgettable
","'If I had to live my life again, I'd make the same mistakes, only sooner.' - Tallulah BankheadWhy do I love 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?' Because it's refreshingly unique, funny and the most inventive love story made in a very long time.Charlie Kaufman proves once more he's quite possibly the most original screenwriter working today. 'Being John Malkovich' was ingenious, and even Kaufman's lesser work - the first two-thirds of 'Adaptation' had some of the best writing in recent memory, but the film fell apart in a ridiculous third act - is better than much of what Hollywood churns out regularly.Buoyed by two fine performances by Jim Carrey as Joel Barrish and (an outstanding) Kate Winslet as Clementine, and Ellen Kuras' vibrant cinematography, 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' dares its viewers to ponder hard about the story and to try and work out the plot in their minds. Kaufman eschews the genre's clich√©s and conventional plot points, which often are albatrosses around writers of romantic-comedies and -dramas.Despite a mind-boggling narrative and dizzying visuals, Kaufman and director Michel Gondry make us care about Joel and Clementine. Which is more than can be said of many conventional romantic films these days. Kaufman's story disorients us, but does make sense. It might seem as if Joel and Clementine are simply meeting endlessly but, as the story unfolds, what you thought was senseless becomes perfectly clear. The film seems to insist we're bound to repeat the same mistakes when it comes to love and relationships. And given the emotional trauma we often endure in love, who wouldn't want to erase sour memories? But erasure also excises all the good stuff, which often is what makes the bad stuff so tolerable anyway.Carrey's an ideal Joel. He brings the right amount of whimsy and confusion to the part. It's a sensationally good breakaway from Carrey's slapstick work. Winslet captivates us as Clementine. Her quirkiness, coupled with an intense lovability, makes her utterly enchanting. And superb supporting turns by Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood help enormously, too.'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' could only have come from the mind of Kaufman. Despite its unconventional approach, the film makes a very basic point: that it's natural for human beings to have a tremendous capacity and desire for romance, love and relationships, no matter the pitfalls. And so, as Joel might say, all we can do is, 'Enjoy it.'",9,0,1,20 August 2004
National Treasure," If only they tried a bit harder
","The frustrating thing about watching a film like 'National Treasure' is knowing that had writers Jim Kouf, Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley, and director Jon Turteltaub tried just a bit harder, they might very well have made a fun, exciting adventure yarn.Occasionally, they manage to squeeze out a moment that hints of fun, when they might have got the tone right. But such bits of pleasure are so sporadic. And they seemingly paid no attention to their story.True, 'National Treasure' is a popcorn film, a movie where you leave logic behind and expect to get caught up in the excitement, no matter how outlandish the story is. But even mindless entertainment still needs some magic and heart. This one is worse than watered-down Indiana Jones stuff.Kouf and the Wibberleys make everything too easy. This is one of those films where the heroes uncover little clues as they go along. But the clues placed apparently by our Founding Fathers are so incredibly cryptic, they never could have expected anyone to solve them. Yet here's Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) reading a preposterously enigmatic riddle and within seconds figuring out the answer is the Declaration of Independence! Don't even ask how easily he finds a crucial secret in the vast, barren expanse of the Arctic. And for us to buy even a smidgen of this story, we have to believe that some of our more important buildings - the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and Independence Hall in Philadelphia - have some of the most lax security in the world.The problem with 'National Treasure' is its script. Which, I suppose, shouldn't surprise anyone. Kouf's more recent screenplays include 'Snow Dogs' (2002) and 'Taxi' (2004), while the Wibberleys' contributions to the world of cinema include 'The 6th Day' (2000), 'I Spy' (2002) and 'Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle' (2003).'National Treasure' is uninspired, lazy storytelling. The action scenes provide little excitement and are too infrequent. As good an actor as Cage is, he might be getting just a bit too old for these parts and really gets nothing to work with. No clever one-liners, no witty comebacks. Diane Kruger as National Archivist Abigail Chase has a better role here than she did earlier this year in 'Troy.' Then again, that isn't saying much. At least, she doesn't have ridiculous dialogue like, 'Last night was a mistake,' this time around.Justin Bartha gets to play the comic relief as Ben's sidekick, Riley Poole, but the jokes aren't all that good. Harvey Keitel's stuck in a winless role as an FBI agent, while Sean Bean gets to play the bad guy - again. However, unlike in the Indiana Jones films, the bad guy here isn't really all that villainous. He wants the treasure, but there isn't an evil or nasty streak in him. He's just a greedy rich guy.And, of course, the big question no one in the film bothers to answer is why is this treasure so important that it had to be hidden away for so long? Its discovery certainly wouldn't change the course of the world in any way. And this lethargic story doesn't change adventure movies for the better, either.",4,1,2,1 December 2004
Inside Man," Spike goes conventional
","Here's my biggest problem with 'Inside Man' - why does Spike Lee start it the way he does? Without giving away anything, I have never understood screenwriters and filmmakers who decide to start films this way as a means of being unconventional. The trouble is, when you pull something like this, especially in a thriller, you take away any sense of danger from the protagonist. The audience is already in the know a couple of minutes into the picture, so it's rather pointless to put your hero, or in this case, anti-hero, in any danger throughout the rest of the picture.'Inside Man' still remains an intriguing picture with some good performances. But after the heist takes on a pleasantly unexpected turn, the writer and Lee don't really go to any pains to hide from us the ugly details of someone's past. Given the character and circumstance, it really isn't too hard to figure out what the big secret is. And once that is done - and, believe me, the secret can be found out very quickly, even before Jodie Foster figures it out - the rest of the film loses much of its edge.There really is no suspense here and you're simply waiting and wondering how the filmmakers will end this.And, therein lies another problem. This film does not know when to end. Like the Energizer Bunny, it just keeps going and going and going from one denouement to another.The performances are good. Then again, with Owen, Foster, Denzel Washington, Willem Dafoe, Chiwetal Eijofor and Christopher Plummer, how could they not be? But Washington, at times, seems to be going through the motions without much conviction and Foster - who's role is never quite explained, but that's alright - gets to be juicily cunning.Lee's touches are unmistakable. Ever the political filmmaker, the best moments of 'Inside Man' are the slight ones, the ones you quickly forget. Lee, in passing, makes subtle, yet potent, statements about police response in a post-9/11 America (and New York) and also how Americans continue to confuse Arab with Muslim, Sikh with Arab or Muslim or just about anyone who looks different with Arab or Muslim.'Inside Man' is an enjoyable, albeit slight, escape into a heist film that is not as taut as it thinks it is.",5,2,5,17 April 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Over-rated hype
","Unfortunately, Russell Crowe likely will win as Oscar for this one. Sad, because Tom Wilkinson deserves it for 'In the Bedroom.' Actually, Crowe shouldn't have even been nominated. Anthony LaPaglia was so much better in 'Lantana,' a film that was completely ignored.If not for Jennifer Connelly's performance, 'A Beautiful Mind' would have made my worst films of the year list. She was the best and only thing about this film. The other characters, especially Nash, as played by Crowe, were thoroughly uninteresting. I couldn't care less whether he was delusional or not - he was a boring person. I don't believe a film needs to have sympathetic or likable characters to be good. But there was no one - other that Connelly's character - I cared about. And *****SPOILER ALERT*****is there anyone in the audience who did not see that pen scene coming a mile away?This was truly one of the most disappointing films of 2001. How it got so many Oscar nods is beyond me.",1,13,23,26 February 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Coasting on star power
","Take a generous helping of 'True Lies' (1994), add a hint of 'The Thin Man' (1934) and toss in a dash of 'Prizzi's Honor' (1985) for good measure and what have you got? Why, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith,' of course.I can't remember the last time I saw a film that depended so completely on its stars' charisma to carry it. Luckily for director Doug Liman and screenwriter Simon Kinberg, they have Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, both of whom have undeniable screen presence. But as well as they click, even Pitt and Jolie have to overcome a script that loses its way in the third act and a story with enough holes to drive through several convoys of trucks.One critic said this film contains a level of sophistication, a la 'The Thin Man' films. The Smiths are no Nick and Nora Charles. Make no mistake about it. The banter between Pitt and Jolie doesn't even come close replicating the Charleses' repartee. 'Come to daddy,' Mr. Smith says during a fight. She decks him and replies, 'Who's your daddy, now?' Simon Kinberg's script really doesn't go beyond this level. You want sophisticated comedy? Watch an Ernst Lubitsch movie.All that being said, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' still remains enjoyable for the most part. Much of the enjoyment comes from watching Pitt and Jolie play off each other. There's undeniable chemistry between these two stars and they know how to use it. They make their dialogue - however preposterous it may seem - to sound natural. You get the feeling these are two people awfully comfortable in each other's space and that helps a great deal.Director Doug Liman knows how to shoot action sequences. He's proved it before. Here, again, the action scenes are exciting, pounding and fast-moving. But where the film comes apart is when, for some inexplicable reason, Liman and Kinberg abandon their characters and turn 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' into an excuse to blow things up and nothing else.True, this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door film. There's no doubt about that. But the story had potential and the film gets off to a terrific start. But it really gets too caught up in the action and forgets about its two very interesting protagonists.On 'Inside the Actor's Studio,' Jolie said that the film's stunt coordinator looked at the script and added plenty of action, turning essentially a half-page of action into several weeks of shooting. And that very well could've been the problem.The film gets more ridiculous as it goes along, culminating in an outrageous shoot-out that defies belief even for a film of this nature. The sequence also isn't done that well, either. For a good example of how to make such moments taut, tense and thrilling, watch the Italian film, 'The Nest' (2002), which essentially takes place inside a warehouse.'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' ultimately has more bluster than it ought to. There are two tremendously talented stars and one awfully capable director. But somehow they get so wrapped up in the film's cacophonous action that they ignore this story's most important aspect ¬ñ its charming characters.",6,1,2,1 July 2005
Man on Fire," Over-indulgent mess
","The first 50 minutes or so of this film are pretty decent as we see Creasy (Denzel Washington) getting to know Pita (Dakota Fanning), the kid he's guarding. The excessive direction by Tony Scott is tolerable until then because the Creasy-Pita story is engaging.But then the film unravels completely. Scott, who apparently has no interest whatsoever in maintaining a shot longer than a few seconds, over-directs to the point of it being utterly annoying and ridiculous. The excessive jump cuts and flashy cinematography (which really doesn't work here) become more than mere distractions. Scott might be trying to prove he can evoke the film-making styles of, say, '21 Grams,' 'City of God' or even Soderbergh's 'Traffic,' but here it just comes off as over-indulgent. What exactly is Scott trying to prove or express when he not only provides English subtitles for Spanish dialogue, but also has English subtitles when the characters speak English?It's hard to imagine Brian Helgeland, who did such a terrific job adapting Dennis Lehane's novel 'Mystic River' for Clint Eastwood, penned this adapted screenplay, too - another revenge story. But whereas 'Mystic River' packed an emotional wallop with believable characters, 'Man on Fire' just has characters going through the motions. There's nothing here to keep us hooked. That might be Scott's, not Helgeland's, fault. Under the guidance of another director, someone who cares more about story and less about style, this might have turned into a gripping film.Washington tries hard to rise above the thin material with which he's working. Fanning does an admirable job, too. She's cute, likable and definitely clicks in her scenes with Washington. Giancarlo Giannini and Rachel Ticotin build a nice chemistry between them, but none of the actors in this muddled mess is able to overcome the rather tepid story.The film is about 50 minutes too long. Toward the end, this film really begins to drag. There are twists to the plot, but many can be anticipated long before they happen. As for one very crucial twist, not only is it predictable, but it doesn't make much sense if you think about it carefully, especially if you consider how parents might normally behave.'Man on Fire' just winds up being a nasty, noisy exercise masquerading as stylish filmmaking. If you want to enjoy Washington, you're better off renting 'Glory,' 'Much Ado About Nothing' or 'Malcolm X.'There must have been something in this script that attracted Washington to this movie. What that is, I haven't the foggiest idea. He might want to be a bit more discriminating about the roles he picks. Though, the trailers shown at the screening I attended included Washington in 'The Manchurian Candidate.' What would possess someone, Jonathan Demme included, to remake that masterpiece and set it in contemporary times is beyond me.",3,5,13,24 April 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Silly, goofy and very funny in spurts
","Although 'Anchorman' lacks the inspired lunacy of, say, 'Airplane!' (1980) or 'Hot Shots!' (1991), I found myself laughing more than I expected and probably more than I should have.This is an amiable comedy that, when it works, does so because of the earnest performances by Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Fred Willard and Steve Carell, who almost steals the film as Brick Tamland, the world's dumbest weatherman.This is essentially an extended comedy sketch. Even at a mere 90 minutes, it seems stretched a bit too much. The comedy that works is the satire on TV coverage, when the film parodies the news business. The news bits and the TV station's promos are funny because, although the film is set in the 1970s, local TV stations even today resort to corny promos to win over their audiences.The humor clearly is lowbrow and that's fine. There are as many hits as misses, but when the comedy hits, it's hilarious. The love scene's pretty funny, and there's a hysterically funny awkward moment when Ron offers to take Veronica on a tour of San Diego. Too bad the actual tour doesn't prove to be funny.When writers Ferrell and Adam McKay, who also directed, go for broad sweeps, the comedy just isn't there. They're straining for laughs and the scenes don't work. An all-out brawl seems utterly pointless and an impromptu jazz flute scene is sporadically funny. It goes on for too long, as does an a cappella sequence by the news team. The cameos are interesting, but do we really need to see Ben Stiller in every movie?Ferrell throws himself so enthusiastically into Ron Burgundy that it's tough not to like this chap. I wish they had more fun with the teleprompter or had him bungle real news. On the other hand, Fred Willard makes deadpan comedy an art form (watch his hilarious turn as Buck Laughlin in 2000's 'Best in Show'), yet the writers don't give him enough funny stuff with which to work. His one-sided phone conversations were ripe for terrific comedy, but they fall flat.An intermittently funny film, 'Anchorman' comes apart at the end in an unfunny bit set in a zoo covering 'the greatest story in the history of the world.' I realize I might be in the minority here, but I found nothing humorous here. It had the potential to be sidesplittingly uproarious but, instead, seemed awfully forced. The film called for a stronger, funnier denouement. But, by then, the writers apparently had run out of ideas.",6,2,4,12 July 2004
Stranger Than Fiction," Kaufman-lite, but Forster's best film is charmingly good
","I saw 'Stranger Than Fiction' because the trailer made the film seem awfully intriguing and, despite Will Ferrell's appearance, it also starred Emma Thompson and Maggie Gyllenhaal.I realize the studio decided to sell this film as a comedy. And it is. But also is much more. It's heartwarming, fantastical and maintains a certain sweetness that, as cynical as I am, I found incredibly appealing.The story's hook: Renowned author Kay Eiffel (Thompson) is penning her latest book in which her protagonist is a chap named Harold Crick (Ferrell). However, unknown to her, Crick is an IRS auditor in real life and can hear her narration in his head and that drives him bonkers.What follows is a wonderful film that unwinds unexpectedly and slowly, allowing us to know and appreciate not only Kay and Harold, but also supporting characters, including a literature professor Jules (Dustin Hoffman) and a bakery-story owner Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), who proves to be Harold's object of desire.It is inevitable that Zach Helm's screenplay would draw comparisons to Charlie Kaufman's works, 'Being John Malkovich' (1999), 'Adaptation' (2002) and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' (2004), which is one of my favorite films. I suppose it is unfair to compare Helm to the incomparable genius that is Kaufman.So, though Helm seems like Kaufman-lite, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is helped immensely by four superb performances and it's premise: The responsibility of at. How many good films could you say you've seen about that topic? Ferrell - who is best in small doses, which is why I've never really enjoyed his starring roles all that much - is finely subdued as a man slowly becoming unhinged as he realizes his fate. Ferrell never overacts - I know, that's shocking to believe, but true - and his goodness and kindness serves the story very well. I wish he'd take on more roles like this and fewer Ron Burgundys.Thompson makes a welcome return to the screen - I know she was in 'Nanny McPhee' (2005) and 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' (2004) - but she's back playing a normal person. Kay's a woman with writer's block, desperately trying to figure out how to end her novel. She knows how it will end, but doesn't know how exactly, if that makes sense.But the star of the film is Gyllenhaal. She truly is one of the most gifted and talented actresses working today, someone who completely takes over a film with her charm and uncommon beauty. Here, she's Ana who's being audited and turning Harold's love life upside down. She wins us over with a minor role.The questions Helm raises in his film are intelligent ones about art, love, life, responsibility. If there's a flaw in the film, it is the ending. The ending is a compromise. And I couldn't help but think it felt something handed down by a studio exec. I don't know. Or, perhaps, Helm, realizing that he needed to make his film more appealing to the masses, compromised at the very end. He does seem to make it work, though the other possibility would have been excitingly intriguing, trying to see if the characters could get out of that one.However, the compromise aside, 'Stranger Than Fiction' works beautifully. Despite it's fantastic ideas, it never seems forced or false. We buy the premise and are taken along for a delightful ride. I always thought Forster's other, better known, films, 'Monster's Ball' (2001) and 'Finding Neverland' (2004), were a tad over-rated. With 'Stranger Than Fiction,' however, he proved me wrong. He's made one of the best films of the year.",8,0,1,7 December 2006
The Wrestler," Terrific performances, but the story is pretty formulaic
","There is no denying that Darren Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler features two tremendous performances by Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei. But there's also no denying that former The Onion editor Robert Siegel's screenplay is rather conventional, plot-wise. And that does hamper this film.Which is perhaps why Academy Award voters decided not to nominate 'The Wrestler' for Best Picture or Siegel's screenplay. If you look at the other original screenplay nominees - Courtney Hunt for 'Frozen River,' Mike Leigh for 'Happy-Go-Lucky,' Martin McDonagh for 'In Bruges,' Dustin Lance Black for 'Milk' and Andrew Stanton and Jim Reardon for 'Wall-E' - conventional or formulaic they certainly are not.This is not to say that I didn't enjoy 'The Wrestler.' It is great to see Rourke back and acting to his fullest potential. Not only is this a juicy, meaty role - though some might argue he really isn't acting but simply being himself - but it is such a far cry that some of the crappy movies he came to be known for.Perhaps it is because Rourke finds such a personal connection to Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in 'The Wrestler' that he is able to truly tap into the character's deepest fears and insecurities. Rourke is completely convincing as the once-famous, now washed-up wrestler peddling his talents at dingy venues and trying to eke out a living at mediocre autograph sessions. There's genuine angst in Rourke's performance and it is one that certainly propels the film forward.Tomei, too, turns in a stunning performance as Cassidy, a stripper more by circumstance than by choice. It is a bravura turn by this one romantic-comedy lead. She has matured brilliantly as an actress and there really isn't a false note in her performance.But then there's Siegel's screenplay. I realize there are tons of people who absolutely adore this film and my reaction to the movie isn't by any means meant to demean their adoration.'The Wrestler' starts out well and, for the first 30 minutes or so, kept me wondering where it was heading. It had a few genuinely nice surprises. But then comes the scene in the dressing room after a match. When that happened, I immediately knew how a conventional writer would unwind the plot. I hoped this film wouldn't, but it did. Everything I expected would happen happened. The twists, the turns, the character revelations - nothing that came after surprised me and that was a huge disappointment.I would have expected something novel from Aronofsky, but he clings to Siegel's formulaic script and provides us with nothing that we couldn't have anticipated. I kept waiting for something to change my mind, but nothing did.So what we're left to marvel at are Rourke's and Tomei's remarkably honest and, at times, brutally so, performances. And what I was left wondering was how much better, more trenchant, this film could have been with a more original screenplay.",6,6,9,16 February 2009
Hitch," Adds nothing new to the genre
","In 'Hitch,' a predictable script and some surprisingly uninspired acting bog down an interesting concept.For starters, this film runs way too long for a romantic comedy. It overstays its welcome around the 95-minute mark, but then continues on for another 20 minutes or so. And those 20 minutes aren't anything spectacular; in fact, they're rather mundane.Romantic comedies, by their very nature, are utterly predictable. Occasionally, you find one that goes against the norm, that tosses in unexpected twists and ends unconventionally. But those tend to be independent films; Hollywood surely won't risk making something as daring as an original idea.This is another film that attempts to get by on its stars' charisma. And Will Smith and Eva Mendes have enough screen presence to pique our interest. But together, they fall flat. Smith's trying way too hard to be funny and you know this film's in trouble when Kevin James' overacting gives us the funniest moments.Of course, I didn't watch this movie expecting Hepburn and Tracy or even Allen and Keaton. But apparently everything that's even mildly amusing already was in the trailer. The rest of the film just sort of ambles along at a leisurely pace, occasionally making us smile. There aren't any huge laughs, any unexpected moments, anything even remotely original.Smith and Mendes surely deserve better material than this.Hollywood keeps lamenting that box-office receipts are down this year. There's a reason for that. The movies Hollywood studios are churning out don't make me want to rush out and seem them. If studios put out better product, maybe we will be keener on seeing those movies.",5,0,1,1 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Much better than the last two, this motion picture is
","I realize there's a whole generation of American moviegoers who erroneously believe American cinema - or cinema itself - didn't begin until 1977 with the release of 'Star Wars.'The reason the 1970s is the greatest decade for American films is not because of 'Star Wars.' Those of us who remember when 'Star Wars' was first released know that most of America's best films were made before we heard of Luke, Leia, Han Solo and Obi Wan. Just look at some the remarkable movies released before Lucas unleashed 'Star Wars' - the first two 'The Godfather' films, 'The Conversation,' 'Brewster McCloud,' 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller,' 'Nashville,' 'Badlands,' 'Network,' 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,' 'Taxi Driver,' 'The Parallax View,' 'All the President's Men,' 'Sugarland Express,' 'Dirty Harry,' 'The Man Who Would Be King,' 'Five Easy Pieces,' 'Klute,' 'Fat City,' 'Lenny,' 'Chinatown,' 'Mean Streets,' 'The Last Picture Show,' 'Deliverance,' 'The Sting' and Lucas' own, 'American Graffiti.' One could easily argue the decline of greatness began with 'Star Wars.'Nevertheless, I enjoyed Lucas' initial trilogy. Never considered them to be the greatest works of cinema, but they have their thrilling, popcorn quality. And I was quite satisfied with those three.Then, he went and spoiled it all with the second trilogy. I know ardent 'Star Wars' fans consider all the films masterworks, but 'The Phantom Menace' (1999) and 'Attack of the Clones' (2002) were garbage. They might have looked good - and several renowned critics fell over themselves trying to praise the films as if they were obliged to do so because the great Lucas directed them - but the films were crap. The stories were dull, the acting atrocious (even with the likes of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman) and they were utterly needless exercises in excess.Of course, the biggest joke was Lucas calling himself an independent filmmaker a few years ago. John Sayles in an independent filmmaker. George Lucas is an independently wealthy filmmaker backed by a huge Hollywood studio for his mega-million dollar, f/x-laden movies. Let's see, who's 'Revenge of the Sith' peddling these days? A burger joint, chocolate and soft drinks. Independent filmmaker, indeed! I still am not convinced the world of cinema needed the second trilogy. That doesn't mean I didn't like 'Revenge of the Sith,' the third (and, we hope, final) installment in the 'Star Wars' saga. This one's certainly better than the first two in the second trilogy. Then again, Lucas would have been hard pressed to do worse than those two films.'Revenge of the Sith' has two things going for it. It's sufficiently dark and more cynical than its two predecessors and Jar-Jar Binks doesn't show up until the very end and only for a quick glimpse. That alone makes this one far superior to 'The Phantom Menace' and 'Attack of the Clones.' By tapping into Anakin's ugly nature, Lucas is able to explore the intricacies of human nature. His story takes on a much more grim view of his characters, not just Anakin, but all of them. Too bad, he has Hayden Christensen playing Anakin. I'm sorry, but this chap's terribly wooden as an actor. He's incapable of expressing any emotions honestly or convincingly - it's always evident he's trying too hard. This guy makes Mark Hamill seem like a master thespian. Of course, this time Lucas gives Portman nothing to do other than to stand around looking pregnant and stilted. This enormously talented actress gave her three worst performances in this trilogy.Whether intentional or not, Lucas seems to draw parallels to a post-9/11 America. The Senate votes to give Chancellor Palpatine (played rather well by Ian McDiarmid) broader powers for the sake of security and when he chooses to expand his empire to the cheers of the senators, Padm√© (Portman) laments, 'So, this is how liberty dies - with thunderous applause.' And later, Anakin-turned-Darth seems to channel George W. Bush to advise Obi Wan about taking sides.As much as those little digs are fun, the film's biggest problem is the writing. Lucas might be a talented filmmaker, even a visionary artist. But the guy cannot write good dialogue. He suffers from James Cameronitis. There's a reason the screenplay for 'Titanic' (1997) wasn't nominated for an Oscar - it stunk.Why the heck didn't Lucas call in a talented screenwriter to fix the dialogue? I thought Lucas would be smart enough to realize how putrid his dialogue was when he read his script. Watching talented actors, such as Portman, Samuel L. Jackson and McGregor, deliver some of the lines made me cringe. Good thing their payday was so big.Lucas doesn't spend a lot of time showing the elimination of the Jedi, who crumble rather timidly. There's also a huge plot hole at the end involving Obi Wan. I realize why Obi Wan does it; if he'd acted logically, the whole story comes apart, as does the first trilogy. But given what a smart fellow Obi Wan is supposed to be, his actions make little sense.'Revenge of the Sith' is critic-proof. It's definitely the best of the more recent bunch. The special effects are downright spectacular and the story moves along at a sufficiently robust pace. But, for me, the magic wasn't there. It was an enjoyable diversion, nothing more. I realize that offends those who worship at the feet of George Lucas. But one thing this film proves is that the likes of Jackson, Portman, McGregor and Christensen are just no match for the likes of Ford, Fisher and Guinness.",5,2,4,10 June 2005
Ray," One great performance does not make a masterpiece
","There's no doubt about it. As Ray Charles, Jamie Foxx is downright brilliant. But one great performance doesn't necessarily make a great film, let alone a masterpiece.Taylor Hackford's 'Ray' definitely remains an interesting film filled with sensationally good music. But more often than not, the film feels more like a series of greatest hits clips strung together than a cohesive, moving narrative about the great artist's life.True, the film doesn't merely stick to the good parts of Ray's life. It delves into his darker side - his drug addiction and womanizing. But we really don't need to be told this repeatedly for us to get a good understanding of the man. Unfortunately, Hackford, working from a script by James L. White, doesn't seem to quite get that point.As courageous a film as this might seem, there's something awfully familiar about it. Much of 'Ray' unwinds like a generic biopic, hitting all the customary marks, emphasizing all the clich√©s; the sort of stuff you might expect to see in a retrospective docudrama on VH1.Hackford and White obviously are reverential of their subject, yet they don't mask the ugly bits. However, whenever the story veers into Ray's unseemly behavior, the film flashes back to his childhood struggles, his guilt over his brother's death, his blindness at an early age. It's the requisite overcoming-adversity story and, after a while, gets redundant. Hackford keeps drowning us with the water motif, imagery that turns terribly heavy-handed as the film wears on.That 'Ray' succeeds at any level is due entirely to Foxx's riveting performance. He deftly captures the great man. It's a performance fueled by creative intelligence, brimming with energy, humor, pathos, charm and swagger. Foxx gets everything right, from the genius musician's gentle swaying at the piano to his irresistible charm.Foxx's remarkable turn aside, the rest of the film seems rather mundane. The writer saddles his actors with pedestrian dialogue and much of the film has a sense of d√©j√† vu. Record executives often are seeing smiling and congratulating each other over their discovery, Ray repeatedly falls under the spell of heroin, has problems with his personal life and composes yet another amazing song.There are some wonderful moments in the film. We learn why Ray wore those iconic sunglasses and why, early in his career, he insisted on being paid in $1 bills. Kerry Washington provides the story's moral center and brings a fine sense of strength, dignity and vulnerability to her Della Bea. Her early scenes with Foxx are especially touching. Regina King gets one well-done scene when her Margie and Ray break out into an angry rendition of 'Hit the Road Jack.' As exciting as that moment is, it, too, like another when Ray creates an impromptu session with 'What I'd Say,' rings more like a best-of moment, as if every one of Ray's songs stemmed from some tumultuous event.Ray Charles was an extraordinary musician. He was unique, blending gospel, blues and country to create some of the greatest songs ever written. He deserved a biopic that also was unique, not conventional, in its approach to telling his story.Don't get me wrong - 'Ray' is worth seeing. If not for Foxx's performance, then simply for the sheer pleasure of listening to some of the best music you'll ever hear. Foxx certainly deserves his Oscar nod. But I don't believe the film deserves its Best Picture Oscar nomination. There were other films in 2004 - 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' 'Hotel Rwanda,' 'Before Sunset,' 'Kill Bill, Vol. 2' and 'Maria Full of Grace' spring immediately to mind - more deserving of that honor.",7,2,4,16 February 2005
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Flawed, a bit clich√©d, even manipulative, but still good
","Clearly inspired and influenced by 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), 'Tae Guk Gi' is, in many ways, the film Steven Spielberg's war epic wanted to be and should have been. Kang Je-Gyu's often brutal film about the Korean War owes much to that visceral WWII film, but I found it more engaging, moving and emotionally powerful than Spielberg's highly praised movie.'Tae Guk Gi' isn't perfect. But its attributes outweigh its flaws.What works are its two main characters. Jang Dong-Kun (as Jin-tae) and Won Bin (as Jin-sock) are utterly believable as two brothers who dote on each other and find themselves in an untenable situation.Director Kang Je-Gyu knows how to orchestrate action sequences, as he proved in 'Shiri' (1999). Here, again, he fills the film with terrific action. He gives the film a sense of grittiness that would make Sam Fuller proud and choreographs a shoot-out sequence that clearly pays homage to the great Sam Peckinpah. And Peckinpah would have been proud. The battle scenes are as graphic and emotionally devastating as one could get in a movie.What's interesting is that 'Tae Guk Gi' doesn't take sides. Kang Je-Gyu depicts the insanity of war and how innocent people can get sucked up in its vortex. Here, the South Koreans are as ruthless and vicious as the North Koreans. He also takes great pains to show how patriotism can warp people's sensibilities - a lesson for all of us in these jingoistic, warmongering times in the U.S., where critics of the Iraq War and this administration are quickly dubbed as being unpatriotic and war hawks wrap themselves in the American flag and excuse unconscionable behavior.The flaws of 'Tae Guk Gi' could easily be linked to the film's Hollywood trappings. In his attempt to emulate 'Saving Private Ryan,' Kang Je-Gyu adopts some of that film's storytelling techniques, such as a framing device.The trouble with framing devices such as this is that when a film begins with a central character at a later age and then flashes back to his youth, it's impossible to put us on tenterhooks when that character is in danger. We know he survives because we've seen him as an older person. 'Tae Guk Gi' would have worked fine without the prologue. The director should have just kept the coda, which is moving and believable.In fairness to Kang Je-Gyu, he doesn't tell his story from the wrong person's point-of-view as Spielberg did in 'Saving Private Ryan.' Also, unlike in that film, the characters in 'Tae Guk Gi' don't come off as conventional stereotypes. We care about the two brothers and what happens to them, even though one brother's character arc seems abrupt and a bit too convenient.If 'Tae Guk Gi' proves one thing, it's that Hollywood's influences stretch worldwide and infuse themselves into the work of foreign filmmakers, too. The flaws of 'Tae Guk Gi' are that some moments represent the hokey trappings of war films, clich√©s we've seen in countless other war movies and ones we hope filmmakers would eschew.I'm sure every battlefield had its sitting-around-the-fire moments of camaraderie. But anyone who's seen war movies knows exactly what will happen in those moments. We know who will survive, who won't. And in these moments, 'Tae Guk Gi' doesn't do anything differently than a typical Hollywood war movie.Even though the film runs about 10 minutes too long, 'Tae Guk Gi' has much going for it. Thanks to the characters and some sensationally well-done sequences, the film manages to overcome most of its clich√©s and soap opera moments to give us a strikingly powerful film.",8,9,12,26 March 2005
The Terminal," Unrealistic scenes from an airport mall
","As the end credits rolled I wondered how much of Andrew Niccol's original idea remained in the final cut. I maybe wrong, but something tells me Niccol's vision might have been sharper, edgier. Because 'The Terminal' comes off as just too fluffy for something he'd devise.Although the film's inspired by the true story of an Iranian immigrant who's lived at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport since 1988, Steven Spielberg's made a slight comedy that doesn't contain an ounce of reality. It's occasionally amusing, if 25 minutes too long.Tom Hanks' Viktor is a lovable lug. He waddles through the international terminal at JFK Airport and ingratiates himself with the people. Hanks fits the role well - then again, he could play these earnest guys in his sleep. It's nothing we haven't seen from him before.Catherine Zeta-Jones does capably as Amelia Warren, a flight attendant who keeps bumping into Viktor. The problem with Zeta-Jones is that whatever role she plays, be it a cat burglar or a musically inclined jailed murderess, the audience is always aware that it's the Zeta-Jones on the screen. She never wholly envelops a role.Throughout 'The Terminal' I kept wondering what another actress, one with more dramatic depth, say, Michelle Pfeiffer or Uma Thurman, might have done with Amelia, how much more resonant and engaging the Viktor-Amelia relationship might have been.There's some fine supporting work from Kumar Pallana as Gupta, the Indian janitor, and Barry Shabaka Henley, as an airport security officer.Despite some giant plot holes, the film works when it occasionally delves into the other world that exists within the airport - this subterranean netherworld of baggage handlers, construction workers, food service people, janitors, customs officials and late-night poker games.But there aren't any moments in this film that feel real. This is all fantasy - from improbable romances to lapses in logic to the 'Oh well, aw shucks' denouement. (By the way, this film has too many endings.)This JFK airport doesn't seem as frenetic a place as it should be; the only bit of anguish is early in the film when Viktor rushes from one TV screen to another looking at war footage from his homeland and being unable to find out what's happening.Spielberg gives the film such an airy feel that he misses golden opportunities to comment about how airports have essentially turned into malls where planes fly out and land, as well our treatment of immigrants these days, especially if they're Arab. There's absolutely no sense of a post-9/11 America in this airport. One line of dialogue briefly hints about the issue: Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the acting chief of airport security, says, 'They've detained so many people there's no room anywhere' when he fails to get Viktor sent to a federal detention center.'Compassion is the foundation of this country,' a character tells Dixon. We know that's not always the case post-9/11. But this film is so enraptured by its manufactured whimsy that it doesn't care to probe the issue any deeper, even in the background.One thing you will notice: how prominently Burger King, Borders and United Airlines feature throughout the massive set that was built. Ya gotta love product placement. (Maybe it will help United crawl out of bankruptcy.)This comedy doesn't pack huge laughs. Instead, it opts for occasionally amusing vignettes that might make you smile. It's not a terrible way to spend time ('Connie and Carla' anyone?), but it could have been much more rewarding and less disappointing, considering the tremendous talent involved in front of and behind the camera. A bit more reality and a little less fable would have worked wonders without losing any of the story's magic.",5,1,3,23 June 2004
Music and Lyrics," It's all about chemistry
","Despite it's cheesiness and inevitable predictability, this one's all about chemistry. You really have to be incredibly dense and daft not to know how a romantic comedy's going to end, so you hope the pleasure of the film is going to be the journey the actors take us on.What makes 'Music and Lyrics' work are Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant. The two of have charm and comedic timing to spare, but they also supremely click together as an on-screen couple.Alex Fletcher seems tailor-made for Grant. There's a certain charming arrogance that Grant exudes as Alex, a man who knows his place in pop culture, if you will.Barrymore's an absolute darling as Sophie. Though, frankly, she could play these roles in her sleep. She breathes life into Sophie - and the film. She mines wonderful comedy from relatively ordinary moments. The fact that she also has one of cinema's most radiant smiles doesn't hurt, either.I know why Barrymore takes on these roles. But I would now love to see her in a truly dramatic role.The film's loose bit of casting is Kristen Johnston as Sophie's sister, Rhonda. Hr character is a clich√© of the genre - the sidekick - but wasn't Joan Cusack available? Seriously. Johnston's way too over-the-top. Subtlety has never been her forte and she plays everything so broadly that her shtick gets a bit annoying after a while.'Music and Lyrics' is a typical romantic comedy. Plot wise, there are no surprises. But it's a pleasant deviation from most of the tripe Hollywood usually churns out. And the reason for that? Grant and Barrymore.",7,0,0,20 May 2007
The Queen," Why Helen Mirren is one of the greats
","From the opening scene of Queen Elizabeth sitting down for a portrait to the final moments of 'The Queen,' Helen Mirren completely holds Stephen Frears' film together.If Mirren is not nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award - in my judgement, she also should win it - the Academy will seriously have to reconsider whether the Oscars honor the year's best.Making a film about the Royals in the days after Diana's tragic death in 1997 might seem like an odd choice. But Frears and screenwriter Peter Morgan - who incidentally teamed up three years ago for 'The Deal,' which featured Michael Sheen as Tony Blair - have turned what could very easily have been a trashy tabloid story into a compelling, moving and utterly enthralling political drama.Yes, we know Frears and Morgan are merely supposing what happened behind close doors at Balmoral. But their imagination seems to have concocted an awfully good tale of intrigue and political maneuvering, while raising interesting questions about the British Monarchy and whether such a traditional institution can exist in a society that changes almost daily.This is a story of Blair vs. ERII. The question is not whether Diana's death should have created the worldwide outpouring of grief that it did or why, but what the British government and QEII were going to do about it. Whether the grief was warranted or not, it happened. It is understandable that the House of Windsor didn't quite understand why it was happening or how to react. After all, they were more familiar with the British stiff upper lip response, which is what they expected.The conflict between Blair and Elizabeth makes for exciting viewing. Morgan's script is smart, literate and works in small scenes. His characters are all incredibly well developed. He creates intrigue by carefully calculating the give-and-take between the palace and Downing Street. At times, 'The Queen' works as an effective political thriller, something I was not expecting and extremely and pleasantly surprised to see.Frears directs the film expertly. He never over-directs any scene, allowing his film to work in small moments rather than grandiose scenes. He never opts to turn his film into a maudlin and trite story - which could very easily have happened - and many a filmmaker could learn from Fears' use of music. He never lets the score overpower a scene - something American filmmakers should learn how to do - and those moments are more poignant and trenchant because he lets his actors and the situation dictate the emotion.But the film belongs to Mirren. Frankly, I can't ever recall seeing Mirren give a bad performance. She's been in some films that haven't exactly been brilliant, but Mirren's always shone.She so completely gets into Elizabeth's persona and - thanks to some terrific make-up, too - there were times I forgot I was watching an actress play Elizabeth. Mirren's performance isn't only regal and elegant, never once betraying her character's stoic or sturdy center, but it also is beautifully understated. She conveys more in just a suggested look on her face than many actresses can with hundreds of lines.Whether 'The Queen' defends the monarchy or repudiates it is up to you. But the film is not really interested in that issue. It attempts to provide a fictionalized glimpse into a guarded institution at a time when the British people seemed desperately in need of a leader to guide them.",9,0,1,21 November 2006
Shrek," This film is funny.
","This is neither a politically correct film nor is it directed solely at kids, a la another animation company that has churned out crap in the past few years.'Shrek' is a funny, very irreverent piece of film-making that spoofs Disney films (what, they are sacred?) and spins a good yarn, too. The postmodern references are a hoot.Someone didn't like the Gingerbread Man torture sequence. Why not? It was hysterically funny. And *SPOILER ALERT* The Gingerbread Man's return at the end of the film is a hoot. Yes, there is some bathroom humour in this film, but there are some rapid fire jokes that are howlers. The dialogue crackles and it trusts the adults in the audience to know what is funny.The kids will like it because although much of the real humour will be way beyond them, the story and the slapstick antics will keep them glued.This is one of the freshest animation films to come out of Hollywood in years. Of course, you will not like it if you thought 'Pocahontas' and 'Hunchback' were masterpieces.",7,0,0,20 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Good, but certainly not best of the year
","This was much better than I expected and definitely better than 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,' which was an excruciatingly dull (not to mention, seemingly endless) film.I realize Tolkien's book wrapped up everything in the end, but, as a film, 'The Return of the King' has way too many endings. But the action sequences are well done (although CGI is clearly evident in some battle scenes) and this time the film was engaging.But it certainly is not the best film of 2003, though I am sure the Academy will laud it with numerous Oscar nominations and many would feel the film deserves Best Picture simply for the scope of the trilogy. But, this year, there are far better films deserving Best Picture nominations: 'American Splendor,' 'Blue Car,' 'The Station Agent,' 'Swimming Pool,' 'Lost in Translation' just to name a few.",5,2,4,1 January 2004
Munich," Doesn't quite pull it off
","Steven Spielberg was never going to make anyone happy with 'Munich.' Pro-Palestinian factions would find it offensive because the film never delves into why those Arab men took the Israeli athletes hostage (and ultimately killed them), and Jewish groups would find the Jewish characters doubting themselves and their philosophical dilemmas offensive, too.One of my earliest memories of world events was what happened at the 1972 Munich Olympics. I've always been fascinated by what happened and the aftermath. So I was looking forward to this film.I tried to view 'Munich' as a film, not as a political treatise on Arab-Jewish relations or anything else, though it's tough not to see it in that light. I tried to see this film as a thriller loosely based on facts about the Israeli response to the events at the 1972 games. 'Munich' would make a great double-feature with the 1999 documentary, 'One Day in September,' which raised questions also about the hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner that led to West Germany releasing some of those who held the athletes hostage.As a thriller, 'Munich' works in spurts. It's a hit-or-miss film. Spielberg is a terrific visual artist and knows how to frame his shots. But the script by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth is so loose - and I don't mean with the actual events; that is a given - that this thriller never comes close to being as taut as it should.Spielberg's working with a hugely talented cast. But, with the exception of Eric Bana as Avner, the others in his group seems awfully wrong for their parts. Most glaring is Daniel Craig's character, Steve. You're never quite sure what ethnicity he is. In one crucial scene, he's passed off as South African, yet his accent is anything but.Spielberg's decision to handle the hostage-taking and subsequent botched rescue at the airport as flashbacks Avner sees don't really work, especially the final scene. What was he thinking? It's almost as if Kushner and Roth realized they hadn't shown the assault at the airport and so decided to tack it on in an incredibly odd manner.As far as being a political treatise, Spielberg tackles the Palestinian issue, but also seems to use the Israeli response to Munich to discuss life in a post-9/11 America. Golda Meir's comment that even democracies have to compromise their principles for the so-called greater good seems to be a clear allusion to the Bush administration's attitude since 9/11.But that's where it seems to end. Spielberg doesn't seem to be taking any stand. He's neither admonishing nor endorsing anything. And this middle-of-the-road attitude doesn't seem to quite work. It's as if he's trying to be as inoffensive as possible while making a political thriller.Characters also chat about the morality of what they're doing, especially when they're asked to assassinate people based solely on the word of their intelligence agency and they get to see none of the evidence. They wonder where the evidence is. And the answer they get from the higher-ups is that they don't need to know. (Much like this administration not bothering about trivial issues such as due process since it believes holding even U.S. citizens incommunicado, without charges or allowing them to see their lawyers, is perfectly alright.)Where 'Munich' ultimately disappoints is that - rather surprisingly - Spielberg, Kushner and Roth fail to create a compelling story out of what should be riveting stuff. Their plot turns tend to get redundant, even predictable, though there's one well done sequence in the rain. The film needed more of that.'Munich' is by no means an awful film. It runs too long - cutting 30 minutes would have done wonders. The characters also seem strangely aloof. We're never drawn into their predicaments, moral dilemmas and anguish. And, in the end, they just come off mostly as talking-heads.",5,1,3,15 January 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," A stunning achievement: The best film of the year and one of the most exhilarating film-going experiences
","I won't see a better, more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire.' If Academy voters have any sense, they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.Boyle has taken what is essentially a story about a young man on India's version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' and transformed it into a gritty, realistic, powerful and, at times, gut-wrenching fairy tale. It's a Dickensian picture about a world rarely, if ever, seen in mainstream movies, a film that grabs us from the opening frame and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.This is why I love movies. Films like 'Slumdog Millionaire' are rare. They are things of beauty, works of art that make me fall in love with movies all over again. Boyle has done it twice. First with 'Millions' (2004), which also, coincidentally, was about a young boy and money; and now with 'Slumdog Millionaire.' This is Boyle's masterpiece - a stunningly original piece of film-making.Every once in a while there is a sleeper film, usually an independent movie, that comes along, takes everyone by surprise, then gets terrific word of mouth and becomes a huge success. 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' (2002), 'Little Miss Sunshine' (2006) - though I did not care much for it - and 'Juno' (2007) are such films. But, frankly, those films can't hold a candle to 'Slumdog Millionaire.'What might surprise many viewers is that a third of the dialogue is in Hindi. (And Boyle's placement of subtitles on the screen makes such good sense!) Please do not let that dissuade you from seeing this marvelous film. Do not let the R rating prevent you, either. What was the MPAA thinking? Honestly! There are far more offensive, vulgar and violent movies that are rated PG-13. 'Slumdog Millionaire' should never have received an R rating. (This film should be mandatory viewing for young people, especially those in industrialized nations.) Simon Beaufoy's script was originally entirely in English, but Boyle's decision to have the Indian kids speak in Hindi, instead, is the right call. Having the children speaking in their native tongue makes perfect sense, especially because Boyle and Beaufoy depicts the realism of the kids' lives.That's what incredible about this film. Boyle and Beaufoy do not shy away from showing the squalor of Bombay. These kids live in deplorable conditions amid the grime, sewers and trash dumps of the slums. And, yet, thanks of Boyle true ingenuity, he creates uplifting and even humorous moments in the slums. There is one moment - and I shan't spoil it for anyone, but you will know it when you see it - that very well might be my favorite film moment in the last five years.Boyle doesn't do a thing wrong here. From his choice of actors to the music to his choice of colors, Boyle works his magic.The performances are uniformly good. Irrfan Khan finds the right balance between a tormentor and a quasi-father figure as the police officer. There's young Dev Patel as Jamal, playing with confidence, bringing a wonderful swagger to his role, as well as a sense of fear that we completely understand. Freida Pinto as the love interest is superb. And, of course, there are the three young 'uns. Perfectly cast, they actually make the film work. Their performances as Jamal, Salim and Latika are so utterly convincing that they completely draw us into the picture and make the jobs of the older actors playing them much easier.'Slumdog Millionaire' is, I suppose, a dramatic comedy at heart. But it is also much more. It is a film about friendship, gratitude, love, betrayal, poverty and hope. It makes you laugh, weep and cheer as you can't help but marvel at Boyle's sheer genius.The film moves along at a breakneck pace, yet none of the cinematic flair - and there is plenty - seems superfluous. Everything Boyle does, including the Bollywood touches, makes sense. There's such a brilliantly kinetic energy to this film that it is impossible not to be enthralled by it.What Boyle has done is truly miraculous. He has turned a film about street life in Bombay into a visceral, genuine crowd-pleaser. And you will walk out of the movie theater feeling inspired and hopeful, knowing you've just seen something very special.'Slumdog Millionaire' is not to be missed. It is the best movie of the year. And it is, without any doubt, one of the ten best films of the decade.",10,451,748,3 November 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," The most entertaining blockbuster of the year, so far
","Intelligent action-thrillers are so infrequent these days that when a film like 'The Bourne Supremacy' comes along, I savor the moment.Honestly, I don't know what critics who were confused by the plot of 'The Bourne Supremacy' were braying about. If you pay attention - and this is a film that requires us to actually do that, oh the horror! - the plot is anything but confusing. Is it possible audiences have become so numbed by mindless summer actioners that when a film actually requires them to fit together pieces of the plot, many are promptly confused?I also expected to be seasick given the numerous complaints on this site and by critics about director Paul Greengrass' decision to shoot plenty of handheld scenes. Granted, some of the action's jerky, but I didn't find it distracting in the least. In fact, it only added to chaotic nature of Jason Bourne's life.He skillfully uses the handheld method during an absolutely sensational car chase. It's not conventionally shot, that's for sure, and proves to be a refreshing - pardon the pun - change of pace. We don't get the customary shots of each driver behind the wheel, then the steering wheels, then the long-shot down the tunnel, then the points-of-view of each driver, then the spinning car wheels, then back to the close-up of the driver. There was nothing graceful about Greengrass' filming of the chase and that's exactly how it should have been. He brilliantly captures the mayhem of that moment and turned it into an adrenaline rush.This is a thinking-person's film. Screenwriter Tony Gilroy (who also penned the script for 2002's 'The Bourne Identity') trusts his audience and doesn't dumb down the story.Instead of giving us standard wisecracking characters, outlandish visual effects and people we couldn't care less about, Gilroy wrote a terrifically efficient script, giving supporting players like Joan Allen, Julia Stiles and Brian Cox small, but juicy, moments. True, he plays within the conventions of the genre when it comes to villains, but that fact hardly diminishes our enjoyment.Gilroy's made Bourne cool, smart, quick-thinking. I loved how deftly Jason improvised to get out of jams, finding novel uses for a toaster and rolled-up magazine and a speedy way to tap a cell phone.
Matt Damon proves to be an ideal Bourne. He's calm, emotionally restrained. There's nothing flashy about him. Damon humanizes Bourne and brings a level of depth to this character that's rare in contemporary spy/action films. With this film, Damon shows he might be a better actor than many believe.Having been pleasantly surprised by Doug Liman's film two years ago, I was hopeful the sequel would be equally as good. I wasn't disappointed.
'The Bourne Supremacy' is tense, action-filled and, above all, thoroughly entertaining. In a summer that gave us bombastic, bloated, boring blockbusters, such as 'Troy,' 'Van Helsing,' 'King Arthur' and 'Catwoman,' this film proves that a well-told story, bright writing, fascinating characters and electrifying storytelling always trump even the most eye-popping special-effects wizardry.",8,3,4,28 July 2004
The Proposal," It ain't great, but I liked it more than I thought I would
","Boy meets girl. Girl meets boy. They hate each other. They are forced to spend time with each other. Despite a few obstacles, boy and girl realize the other isn't as bad as they initially thought. Boy and girl grow to like each other in an unrealistically short amount of time. Just when they are about to be together, another obstacle is tossed in their way. Boy and girl overcome obstacle and kiss. The end.That is essentially the formula for pretty much any Hollywood studio romantic-comedy and 'The Proposal' is about as Hollywood studio as it gets.The trouble with romantic comedies is that even before the screenwriter can type 'Fade In' on his script, he knows the audience already knows the ending to his story. So he has to make the journey enjoyable and, more often than not, the journey doesn't quite work or fails miserably, as is the case in 'My Life in Ruins,' for instance. True, 'The Proposal' is not nearly as disastrous or dull as the Nia Vardalos film, but that isn't saying much now, is it?The journey in 'The Proposal' is awfully clich√©d and unwinds almost exactly how and when one of those hackneyed screen writing gurus would want the plot to unfold. However, what eventually saves 'The Proposal' are its two stars - Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Together, they don't have much chemistry - you wanna see real on-screen chemistry in romantic comedies, watch Carole Lombard and William Powell in 'My Man Godfrey' (1936) or Lombard and Fredric March in 'Nothing Sacred' (1937) or Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in 'Bringing Up Baby' (1938) or Grant and Rosalind Russell in 'His Girl Friday' (1940) - but, individually, Reynolds and Bullock have charm, charisma and an innate ability to keep us interested.This material is beneath Bullock. She can play these roles in her sleep and, I suppose, the lack of success of her more dramatic films - some have been utter duds and 'Crash' (2004) does not count because she was just part of a huge ensemble and not the lead - forces her to continue seeking romantic comedies. After all, she is the woman who turned down 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004) so she could star in 'Miss Congeniality 2' (2005).Bullock has a nice knack for comedy and does admirably here, given the limitations of the script. It's nothing we haven't seen from her before and perhaps it's that familiarity that brings about a semblance of charm to this picture. Reynolds tends to be a bit of a one-note player but, here again, it's an engaging little note. In his defense, he does have a fine sense of comedic timing and can turn an otherwise conventional line into something funny. Malin Akerman shows up in a throw-away role that she tries valiantly to make bigger.You are not going to see anything in 'The Proposal' that is unpredictable or you haven't seen in countless romantic comedies before. But Reynolds and Bullock bring an energy to the film that made me like it much more than I thought I would. It made me cringe in some places, when I saw screenwriter Pete Chiarelli trying so desperately to eke out laughs because he couldn't drum up anything original.There's plenty of terrific comedic stuff to be mined here - immigration, older woman-younger man, workaholic bosses and much more - but Chiarelli is thoroughly content on sticking strictly to convention. And, given the lack of sizzle between Bullock and Reynolds together, he entrenches his script in formula. So we are treated to forced-funny moments - a 'remedy' screenwriters seek in romantic comedies that rarely works - of seeing the wonderful Betty White doing some sort of American Indian tribal dance in the woods and Bullock hamming it up, and the over-use of Ramone (Oscar Nunez), making him the film's most annoying and unfunny character. We also get needless subplots, including a father-son conflict. I told you: It's as if Chiarelli kept referring to some screen writing handbook. Anne Fletcher's direction is an uninspired as her previous effort, '27 Dresses' (2008). On the other hand, 'The Proposal' is a more enjoyable film than '27 Dresses.' What's ultimately disappointing about 'The Proposal' is that despite having essentially smart characters, it gives them nothing smart to do. What a pity. It was, however, refreshing to see an older woman-younger man relationship on film. After sitting through Catherine Zeta-Jones falling for Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage in bed with Jessica Biel or Harrison Ford romancing Anne Heche or Clint Eastwood hooking up with Rene Russo, it's about time we saw the flip side. And as for the well-choreographed - and much talked about - nude scene in 'The Proposal,' there's one thing you can certainly say: Bullock: has one heck of a body.",4,5,8,27 June 2009
Cinderella Man," Hackiva Goldsman strikes again
","How on earth does Akiva Goldsman continue to get work as a screenwriter in Hollywood? The man's a hack, responsible for such unforgettable masterpieces as 'Silent Fall' (1994), 'Batman Forever' (1995), 'Batman and Robin' (1997), 'Lost in Space' (1998), 'Practical Magic' (1998) and 'I, Robot' (2004). When you watch such tripe, what can one say but Akiva Goldsman! Yes, he won an Oscar for 'A Beautiful Mind' (2001), when Academy voters went completely bonkers and decided to honor claptrap over quality.I wonder how much of what Cliff Hollingsworth wrote made it into the shooting script. Because this film has all the trademarks of yet another hackneyed job by Goldsman. He doesn't have a clue how to find grey areas in his characters. They're either good or bad. That's it. He hasn't seen a cinematic clich√© he doesn't embrace. That's what's wrong with Ron Howard's film, 'Cinderella Man.' Apparently, boxer James J. Braddock's life was nothing but a series of clich√©s. That this film remains partially interesting is due to Russell Crowe's uncanny ability to disappear into a character and Paul Giamatti's sensationally terrific performance as Braddock's trainer, Joe Gould. Ren√©e Zellweger gets a poorly written role as Braddock's long-suffering wife.'Cinderella Man' is the ideal film for the George W. Bush administration. It's shamelessly manipulative, alters reality to suit its needs and comes with such jingoistic fervor that you feel like a pariah for not liking it. Not liking this film could be downright un-American. And, as we all know, these days, being called unpatriotic is worse than being called a pedophile.'Cinderella Man' is the kind of film so seeped in its own sense of righteous goodness that it seems destined to be embraced by Academy voters next year. At least, that could very well result in Giamatti finally getting an Oscar nomination, something he was shamefully denied for his performances in 'American Splendor' (2003) and 'Sideways' (2004).In this film, Braddock doesn't just pull himself up by his bootstraps. The guy's too poor to own boots. So he pulls himself up on borrowed bootstraps! I've no doubt the real Braddock was a decent chap who boxed to save his family from dire straits. But I doubt he was as uncomplex a person as Goldsman made him. Also, Max Baer wasn't the ogre Howard and Goldsman make him out to be. In this film, Baer (Craig Bierko) is an obnoxious, insensitive, womanizing brute who gloats about killing two men in the ring.There've been some great boxing films throughout history, including 'Body and Soul' (1947), 'The Set-Up' (1949), 'Fat City' (1972) and Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, 'Raging Bull' (1980). 'Cinderella Man' isn't one of them. Though, there were times during Howard's film when I was convinced I was watching Scorsese's movie. Not because 'Cinderella Man' rekindled the brilliance, but because Howard clearly borrowed so heavily from 'Raging Bull' for his boxing sequences.Incidentally, while much of the art direction capturing the Great Depression is impressive, what happened when it came to recreating Braddock's ramshackle apartment? Quite frankly, it looked like the set of an amateur theatrical production, and a bad one at that.'Cinderella Man' could've been a trenchant, powerful, gritty film about an honorable man's fight to remain true to himself and his family and his struggle to overcome great adversity. But every momentous occasion - and this film's riddled with them - is telegraphed so broadly and blatantly that it's difficult to be wowed by any of it. You know promises will be broken, 'important' scenes of families coming apart will be shown, flashbacks to hammer home sledgehammer-like what Braddock is fighting for will pop up at the right moments. Goldsman even goes so far as to have a pre-fight meeting between Baer and Braddock where, you guessed it, one guy will be positively rotten and the other charming and humble.Just think what a genuinely good and talented writer could have done with this story.",5,2,4,10 June 2005
The Island," A good example of what's wrong with Hollywood
","Hollywood studio execs bemoaned the loss of revenue this summer. Every weekend, they kept coming up with new excuses, new reasons, new explanations as to why box-office receipts were low. They blamed the weather, proliferation of home theaters, DVD sales, rude movie patrons. Very few, if any, were willing to admit that the main reason fewer people went to movies this summer was because the most of the films stunk! 'The Island' is a great example.Here's a film with an intriguing idea and two very attractive and talented stars. In fact, the first 15, 20 minutes of this film were exciting and refreshingly good for a Michael Bay film.There's was something awfully Kubrickian about the whole set up. The clinical atmosphere of the place, the entirely aloof attitude among the people. Knowing this was a Bay picture, I was pleasantly surprised. This story actually had some substance, something to say. The characters were interesting, their situations and dilemmas intrigued me.Then the whole film went completely berserk. Michael Bay took over. And the likes of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson are relegated to saying dumb things you normally expect to see in a bad Will Smith movie as they're thrust into one inane action sequence after another. All those action scenes could've been jumbled and thrown back into the film and the plot would not have suffered one iota.It's almost as if there are two films in one here. The first half creates an exciting world, raises probing ethical questions and seems intelligent. The second half is loud, obnoxious, unoriginal and a total waste of the early build up.In the end, it's all bluster and thoroughly unsatisfying.'The Island' is yet another example of the dumbing down of America. You can't tell me there are no good original stories floating around Hollywood. It's just that execs are gutless, without vision and keep insisting on churning out the same garbage.Of course, this time they were helped by loads of product placement. There are times when 'The Island' seems like nothing more than a commercial, albeit an expensive one, for some product or another. The number of product-placement shots in this film is beyond vulgar, it's downright obscene.I suppose the one reassuring thing about 'The Island' is knowing that in the mid 21st century, Amtrak still will be running.",1,68,124,5 December 2005
