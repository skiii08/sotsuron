Ali," A truly remarkable interpretation
","And not because it was filmed in my home town, or because the interpreters graced the halls of my hotel.   I had heard both good and bad comments of the film and of Will Smith's interpretation, so I made a point of keeping an open mind when I sat down to see the movie.  And I was truly transported and excited from beginning to end.   I believe Will Smith's interpretation of Muhamad Ali was riveting and true to coverage I have seen over the years of the man he sought to portray.  I could quite easily see Ali over and over again.  I also believe Will Smith is ideally suited to portray the charismatic and serene Nelson Mandela. Although Mandela is larger than life, I am sorry to hear he considered the role too daunting.  Will Smith is very charismatic, and possesses an aura of serenity about him that makes him perfect for this role. If he was very good as Ali, he would excel as Mandela.",9,0,0,25 April 2002
