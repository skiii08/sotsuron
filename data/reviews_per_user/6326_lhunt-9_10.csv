Blade Runner 2049," Blazing new ground, despite the (now obligatory) dystopian vision
","Well, Blade Runner 2049 certainly lives up to the hype, and did anyone mention the soundtrack? Wow. I should, however, expand a little on my recurring critique of dystopian science fiction, since it's about the only kind of scifi you can find at the movies, and Blade Runner 2049 falls into the genre like almost everything else in the scifi category these (unimaginative) days. Dystopian visions of the future abound, but overlook (1) that a lot --- if not most --- of our present problems will be solved --- even in the intermediate future a few decades hence, and (2) that the problems of the future (apart from human nature, which basically never changes) will most likely be substantially different than the problems of today. It's hard to see how a fusion-powered, robotics and biotech-enhanced future is going to be characterized by poverty and homelessness, just for example. Overcrowding? Yes. Few jobs for unskilled workers? Quite obviously. Human nature? The same as ever, as mentioned above. So, despite its slipping into the #dystopiaasusual category, Blade Runner 2049 may possibly be the greatest science fiction film ever produced. Surely there has never been another soundtrack quite like this one, and I'm ready to award the set designers every prize on the shelf. Ryan Gosling is talented enough to carry the lead, and he was very well- supported, including by a re-energized Harrison Ford, who has pulled himself back from the edge of the abyss. Denis Villeneuve has now established that he can do anything (he's now talking about revisiting the Dune narrative; and somebody should actually introduce him to Heinlein and Asimov if he's drifting towards the classics in the genre). So, despite some caveats, this production burns so much new ground that my call is 10/10.",8,13,28,12 October 2017
Captain Phillips," Much more than a drama. Viscerally and emotionally engaging --- and never lets go.
","In the trailer, Captain Phillips comes across as a drama. That's what I was expecting, and it is certainly that. And Tom Hanks, in the lead, does what he so often does. You will totally forget that he is Tom Hanks. Surprisingly (to me, at least), Captain Phillips is also loaded with action and suspense. Once it gears up, it runs nonstop to the end and never lets up. Add to that one of the best recent soundtracks I've come across (you cannot appreciate this film without theatre surround --- it takes place on the open sea, and it's NOT a small screen movie). Finally, Captain Phillips makes an honest effort to tell all sides of the story. We understand exactly why the pirates do what they do, and their story is told as well as that of anyone else. This is a really, really good movie.",10,0,2,1 February 2017
Wind River," Jeremy Renner Excels as a Craftsman in the Lead Role --- including allowing the other actors to stand out on their own....
","It is hard to criticize this movie, with one caveat. We are still in that place where movies about First Nation people have to have white people in them as a principle focus. That said, the film is 'inspired' by actual events, so this may very likely be the way it went down. The film explores the theme of missing and murdered indigenous women, and makes a direct comment about that still-neglected subject at the end. Jeremy Renner plays a fascinating character with huge emotional depth, awareness, respect and sensitivity. Renner's character's skillset is fully developed, and is critical to the film. The fact that he is alert and knowledgeable makes everything else work. I thought Elizabeth Olsen did fine, and the First Nation actors were outstanding --- and could very easily have been more developed than they were. While this film didn't really have to work so hard at building a white character in a First Nation setting, my esteem for Jeremy Renner has nonetheless bumped up a couple more notches. He is really deep and versatile, and in this case, he did not intrude on the space, despite being the film's leading actor. In fact, he had a knack for backing off, and allowing the other actors to shine in their respective roles --- a mark of a very fine craftsman. I'm not sure who else could have played the role if Renner had not been there. One more aspect --- there was no point at which suspension of belief was difficult. I was roped in from the very first minute, and the emphasis on Renner's role as a wildlife tracker was allegorically so much on the mark. That is, the film was about tracking both figuratively and literally, and the themes were intertwined almost perfectly, in my opinion. Kudos to all involved.",8,7,12,7 December 2017
Concussion," Not what I expected
","I work professionally with individuals with concussions, including carrying out post-concussion assessments. Thus, this film was on my must-see list, but it felt a little bit obligatory for that reason. I was expecting kind of a dry, medical progress sort of story, with the scientific hero establishing new insights (and, of course, being recognized, sooner or later, for doing so). While that's kind of true in the final analysis, the story is actually about power and belief, including the struggle to change a system in which the very behaviours that create devastating brain injuries are glorified, celebrated --- and commercialized. That truth has few champions is a recurring story in every field of human endeavour, not just at the junction of science, healthcare and sports. But it is easy to forget how unpopular and unwelcome truth so commonly is, and the many reasons why this is so. On an additional note, Will Smith outdid himself in exhibiting his capacity to portray a character who is obviously not a mere variation of 'himself.' He succeeds at placing himself imaginatively into a character who is somewhat distinctive and, more than that, not at all a North American stereotype --- that is, a successful immigrant who had established much of his success before he ever got here, and was then stymied in the United States by cultural forces whose nature, ultimately, is alien to his own background and experience. In short, this was not a dry, scientific progress story; rather a gripping drama of struggle and hard-won victory --- and still only partially-won.",9,1,2,9 September 2017
Nightcrawler," The beast inside all of us
","This is a brilliant if chilling movie, and Gyllenhaal is sufficiently capable in his role as a totally self-interested opportunist that he is able to recruit his fellow actors and engage them at his level. The film is chock-full of insights into how the media world works in the background --- for example, even 'news' is not about news, but ratings, and bottom dogs may bend or trample the rules in order to gun their ratings. Gyllenhaal is so calculating in the role that he clearly crosses the line into psychopathy, so this is also an opportunity to gain insight into how an antisocial personality might accomplish his objectives while simultaneously pursuing a career path. I was most struck by how Gyllenhaal never once lapsed even slightly or momentarily from his 'reptilian' character. While psychopaths can often be charming, Gyllenhaal's character is probably better described as smooth, quick, unflappable and calculating, as he uses intimidation much more readily than say, flattery or charm (which are also common tools in the psychopath's armamentarium). However, the film is much more than a character study of the psychopathic personality, as it also has much to say about the media business, and about human nature generally. Special credit to Rene Russo for matching Gyllenhaal beat by beat as he escalates into increasingly unsavoury tactics and behaviour.",7,2,3,2 August 2015
Pitch Black," True science fiction
","There are so few true science fiction movies made, this is one of the very few that passes the bill for me. This is not a disguised horror film, though it certainly drifts that way quite a bit. It is certainly not a science film - much is implausible - what do those tens of thousands of indigenous creatures eat when there aren't a handful of humans on the planet and mass extinction is obviously in progress? Let along how do three suns revolve around a group of planets (Newton would shudder in his grave)? But this film does the one thing science fiction is supposed to do - and does it well. It creates an alternative reality and lets you imagine real humans living in it. The alternative reality works, and the psychological elements of the drama are icing on the cake. As a lifelong science fiction fan (in written form), my disappointment at the weakness of science fiction in film is nearly endless. This film encourages me. It is part way there. I'm looking to seeing the sequels (and probably will soon). I would also rate movies such at 13th Floor, Contact, Mission to Mars (and of course, Forbidden Planet) in that class - true science fiction films, as well as the more popular and mainstream original three Star Wars movies and the Alien series.... but not a great deal else.... (perhaps that is why I find Mars Attacks! the most workable ultimate compromise???)",9,0,0,24 September 2006
Avatar," Dated/wrongheaded social commentary, and without any real technological imagination....
","I was honestly very disappointed by Avatar, and this reaction is despite my enjoyment of the homage to Philip Jose Farmer and some other very well-executed scifi flourishes. My problem is that, as a social commentary, Avatar One was entirely misguided. I am a huge James Cameron fan, but he is at his best when telling stories, which he does quite well. So blowing up 'evil' corporations is the way to save the world? How about looking at how it really is? These days, miners spend decades working out agreements with indigenous peoples, providing job training, repairing environmental damage, etc. Avatar is about 100 years out of date in its social commentary. In my own view of the long-term future, we will have unlimited fusion power, and raw materials will be derived primarily, perhaps entirely, through robotic recycling. So maybe we will leave the era of mining the earth entirely behind us (maybe we'll mine asteroids instead - space travel looks different when energy is virtually free). But Mr. Cameron is not telling us ANYTHING about what could make it better in future. He has no real technological imagination, and Avatar spells that out in spades. There are many brilliant failures in science fiction, and unfortunately, Avatar is yet another of them.",4,5,7,22 August 2014
Life," Scifi at the movies is weakest where it should be strongest --- in prompting us to stretch our imaginations further
","There was nothing wrong with this film technically. There was some great acting, and just about everyone will have told you about the plot twists (more than one). Apart from the usual aspect of 9 channels of noise in (actually silent) space, 'Life' does a great job of putting us in a realistic, futuristic extraterrestrial environment. My one complaint --- enough to bump Life from a 4 to a 3-star rating --- is that it has once again decided to portray alien life as evil and scary. Fair enough, it may well turn out to be, and no less a scientist than Mr. Hawking has warned us of that. So my objection is really more than just that --- that for almost as long as there have been science fiction movies, they insist on being (1) dystopian, (2) apocalyptic, (3) quasi-military or (4) horror stories dressed up in science fiction garb. I'm sorry, but back in the golden age of science fiction, the stories were more inclined to be (1) space operas (more recently, The Expanse has got that right) which portray how great human dramas might play out in technologically transformed future worlds; or (2) stories of daily life against a transformed backdrop --- not horror, not utopia, just different (Heinlein excelled at this, though his wonderful stories of daily life and imaginable futuristic adventures never made it to the screen, rather, his least-interesting stories are the only ones ever produced). So, back to the current topic.... Life is, unfortunately, entirely caught up in the current dominant themes in contemporary scifi, and in the end is unable to break free to engage us in the way science fiction ultimately should --- to stir our imaginations by challenging due to visualize the non-obvious implications of technological evolution and change. On that count, despite its many technical and narrative strengths (it is, mostly, a gripping narrative), 'Life' falls back to the tried and tested stereotypes, and has, unfortunately, nothing new to add.",3,1,3,9 September 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Best of its genre... and it might be a new genre!
","Kingsman is just a little over the top, as it's laced with comic book violence, but somehow, that manages to stay in the background. So, start with a little bit of the Matrix, add in a big helping of 'JB' (James Bond, Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer, your pick), and finish, maybe, with Mars Attacks and exploding heads (sorry about that part!)... and wrap it up in a Saville Row suit. How does that sound? Samuel Jackson is a smashing (eccentric) bad guy, newcomers Sofia Boutella and Taron Egerton look to be on the rise, and then you have the dependability of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and a couple of other familiar names. In summary, a suitable evening's diversion. I hope they do a sequel... I have a soft spot for underground lairs and high tech gimmicks, etc., etc.",8,1,7,1 April 2015
Alien: Covenant," A brilliant disappointment
","Alien Covenant is arguably the most imaginative and best-realized film in the Alien series since its genre-defining first chapter (and James Cameron's worthy sequel), an achievement for which Ridley Scott deserves full credit. There are so many points at which the film is original and stunning in its ability to imagine future worlds, realize advanced technologies, depict extraterrestrial landscapes, explore human-android relationships, and more. As always, the aliens themselves are stunningly well-developed. Further, the plot unfolds with similarly skilfully-crafted twists and turns. Who are the aliens? What is their origin, their purpose? Why have we encountered them? All of that is much clearer now. The progression of the story won't surprise any die-hard Alien franchise fans. One by one, the aliens do their damage to the vulnerable and exposed humans, who fight back fiercely and courageously against these acid-blooded killing machines given life. However, as the narrative evolved, I found that I reached a point of disappointment with the story that has become all too familiar while watching science fiction presented on film. While science fiction literature is diverse and often instructive, science fiction at the movies tends to revert to just four overworn themes, that is, they are, de rigueur: (1) dystopian, (2) apocalyptic, (3) quasi-military or (4) horror stories dressed up in science fiction garb. Well, in fairness, Alien has fallen into literally all four of these categories since the beginning, and yet transcended them, perhaps because human pluck and courage has always mattered, no matter how indestructible and relentless the aliens have always proved to be. Avoiding spoilers, I'll refraining from fleshing out my final disappointment in detail. It's not that the film is 'dark.' That is true of every film in the series, and I fully accept that as part of the package (and despite the fact that scfi film is lopsided with dark stories of all of the above- described types). Rather, I'm a science fiction fan and not a horror fan because I'm optimistic, at core, about where technological change is taking us (without, I think, being oblivious to technology's many shortcomings and counterproductivities). I believe Alien Covenant could have maintained its dark, even grim, thematics and still offered some rays of hope for its technologically optimistic followers. I think I understand why the Alien films take so many of the dark turns that they do, and that in itself is not a problem at all. However, in the end, when faced with pursuing fresh ideas or nipping down the first available dark path, Alien Covenant chose the dark pathway reflexively --- really carelessly, when far more interesting and imagination- bending themes could have been explored instead. I wish Mr. Scott had spoken with me first, before finalizing the script!",6,1,4,9 September 2017
