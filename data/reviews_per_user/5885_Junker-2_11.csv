Ali," Details, details, details
","They get the details right.When Will Smith/Muhammad Ali is knocked down at the end of the first Frazier fight, Smith has the details down almost exactly. The way he slowly gets up and then puts his right hand on the ropes is exactly they way it happened in real life. This movie gets the details right.So what is wrong?They say the mood in Ali's locker room before the Foreman fight was one of deadly gloom. Not even Ali's corner men really thought he could beat George Foreman. Not only was he facing the end of his career, but Ali's men were extremely worried that Foreman might seriously hurt their man. It was Ali himself, the one man in that locker room who really thought he could win, that lifted the mood. 'Are we gonna dance?' He kept shouting to Bundini Brown. Soon Brown was answering: 'All night long!'This scene never makes it into the movie 'Ali.' And that is precisely the problem. While director Michael Mann was so intent on getting the details right, he forgot about the mood. The overwhelming odds that Ali faced, not only in the Foreman fight but in the first Liston fight, the fight with the Supreme Court and in so many other instances in his life, are glossed over. Instead, we are only given the facts.Wham. He beats Quarry. Wham. He wins in the Supreme Court. Wham. He faces Frazier. All the scenes are presented, but we never feel their impact. Ali in the course of this movie goes from the most hated man in sports to the most loved. But we never feel the change. Again, we are only given the details.See this movie if you want to see a great performance by Will Smith. Heck, you'll even forgive Smith for 'The Wild, Wild West' based on his marvelous performance here.But if you really want to learn about Muhammad Ali and what made him one of the most incredible figures of the 20th Century, you are better off looking elsewhere. In fact, the documentary 'When We Were Kings' is a far better place to start.",Null,0,0,23 June 2002
Training Day," Two thirds of an excellent movie
","I have very mixed emotions about 'Training Day.' I want to say it was one of the best movies of 2001. However...Denzel Washington is great, very much deserving of the Academy Award he won. And Ethan Hawke is quite good as well. Not to mention Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Cliff Curtis and so on and so on. For the first 70 minutes, I was loving it. However...About 70 minutes into the movie the movie takes a wrong turn from which it never quite recovers.But those first 70 minutes! Wow! What a movie! Jake Hoyt (Hawke) is a young LA policeman who has just transferred into the narcotics division. His first day on the job, a training day, he is introduced to and will serve with Alonzo Harris (Washington). Hoyt knows he must make a good impression on Harris or he will be washed out of the department.Hoyt quickly discovers, however, that Harris is a very unconventional policeman. Hoyt does things 'by the book.' Harris does not. Hoyt knows there are certain lines a policeman must not cross. Harris doesn't care what lines he has to cross as long as he gets the job done. So who is right and who is wrong? Is a little bit, maybe even a lot, of rule breaking okay for the police as long as they are succeeding at their job? In the narcotics division, do the ends justify the means?If the movie had stayed at this level, 'Training Day' could have been one of the best cop movies ever made. However...70 minutes into the movie it takes that wrong turn. And for the last half hour it devolves into just another Hollywood Good Guy vs. Bad Guy movie. A very stylish and well done Good Guy vs. Bad Guy movie to be sure. However...See it for Washington's performance. See it because, whatever its faults, it is a very well made movie. However...it could have been so much more.",Null,0,11,12 August 2002
Iron Man 2," All spectacle, no substance
","'Iron Man 2' suffers from an all too familiar problem these days. Hollywood has become so good at giving us great special effects that this is what they are content to do. Plot? Dialog? Bah! Who needs them! We've got great special effects!Take this as an example of the supposedly funny dialog in this movie: 'Where are you going?' 'New Mexico.' 'Land of enchantment.' 'So I'm told.'Whoa! Zip! Bam! Bing! Move over Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn! Honestly, was anyone really laughing at dialog that lame? The deeper problem isn't just that the dialog is bad, it's that the makers of the movie didn't care! Everything would be forgiven, they felt, because of the wonderful special effects.I pray that Hollywood soon moves beyond our current 'can you top this?' phase and returns to the basics of good film making: Plot, characters, dialog.",3,2,6,1 November 2010
The Beach," The journey is more exciting than the destination
","I really enjoyed the first 40 or so minutes of 'The Beach.' Richard, Francoise and Etienne's journey to The Beach is full of fun, adventure and romance. Unfortunately, guess what happens about a third of the way into this movie? They find The Beach! And we quickly realize that, as is often the case, the journey was far more exciting than the destination.Once at The Beach we find too many characters with too little to do. And while the movie focuses heavily upon Richard (Leo, of course) the other characters are largely forgotten. Even Francoise (played by the lovely Virginie Ledoyen), who is so vital to the first half of this movie, is largely forgotten in the second half.The main failing of 'The Beach' can be summed up by the character of Sal, the leader of The Beach. Without giving away the climatic moment of the movie, Sal becomes the pivotal character in that climax. However, we have learned so little about her up to that point that we simply have no emotional attachment to her character. The climax which should have been a 'Wow!' is instead a 'Ho-hum.'I suppose there are attempts here to make some political and social comments in regard to this utopia the characters have found, but I'm afraid this ain't no 'Lord of the Flies.' I wish the makers of this movie would start over from the top again. This time, have Richard and his friends keep searching, maybe come close, but never actually find The Beach.",6,0,0,29 October 2000
LÃ©on: The Professional," Good acting, bad acting, big plot holes...
","It is a mystery to me why 'The Professional' is rated so high here on the IMDb...#62 as I write this. To be sure, there is much to admire here. But for everything director Luc Besson gets right with this movie he seems to get something else quite terribly wrong.Let's start with the positive: Natalie Portman as Mathilda is a revelation here. Young, beautiful and very, very talented, it should come as no surprise after watching this movie why George Lucas wanted her to play a major role in his second 'Star Wars' trilogy. And Jean Reno as Leon is her perfect counterpart. Reno underplays his role beautifully and the two stars develop a true screen chemistry.Oh, but now the negatives. Gary Oldman, normally a wonderful villain, is way, way over the top as the DEA agent Stanfield. He 'chews up the scenery' to quote other reviewers I have read. (That's not a compliment.) And Oldman's lunatic rantings lead me to the main problem I have with the movie: Plot holes.In order to fully believe the events of this movie you must accept that Stanfield is at least somewhat capable of behaving in a normal manner in society. After all, he holds an important position in the DEA. And he must have a supervisor or two, doesn't he? Could the raving lunatic we see here really function in that role without raising a dozen red flags? I don't think so.Of course, Stanfield has a merry band of followers. Dozens, it seems. One has to wonder if every cop in the city is as corrupt as he is. How in the world do they burst into someone's apartment, kill his wife (in the bathtub!) as well as his teenage daughter and four year old son...again all without raising any red flags?And speaking of that pivotal scene, it is also hard for me to accept that Mathilda's father, knowing what is coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by Noon.The biggest plot hole, however, is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. As well acted as it is, the lone wolf hit-man deciding to 'adopt' a 12 year old girl just does not ring true. It is far too clearly a mere plot device.While watching this movie I was often reminded of the film 'Taxi Driver' which deals with many of the same themes. 'Taxi Driver' is a movie that deserves a high ranking in the IMDB top 250. 'The Professional' does not.",6,27,47,20 December 2004
Resident Evil," From Dusk Till The Ghosts of Mars
","'Resident Evil' follows the all too familiar path of a couple other recent movies: 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and 'The Ghosts of Mars.' All three start with an interesting plot but end up just being about zombies instead. (Or vampires. Or whatever.) It's as if in all three cases the writers got bored halfway through and said 'Oh, heck. Let's just throw in some zombies.'  (Or vampires. Or whatever.)I don't mean to suggest that 'Resident Evil' is terrible. It's okay. But the frustrating thing is that, like those other two movies, it could have been so much more.In fact, the initial plot is rather intriguing: We are set in a secret, underground facility where biological weapons are being created. But something has gone seriously wrong and the computer that controls the facility has started killing off the people who work there. Now an outside team must penetrate the facilities defenses and attempt to take control of the situation.And then...! And then...! Zombies!Milla Jovovich stars as a helpless female who needs protecting at first but soon becomes a tough chick with moves that would do Jackie Chan proud. Okay, her transformation is explained by a memory loss that is slowly regained, but it seems the producers wanted it both ways: Helpless and tough at the same time. Michelle Rodriguez is at least consistently the tough chick throughout. But her constant 'I'm tough, get out of my way' routine gets old quickly.In fact, it is interesting that Rodriguez is second billed in this movie. This seems to be the case only because there was no one else to give second billing to. The male characters are all poorly drawn and very difficult to keep track of. I kept forgetting which one was supposed to be the bad guy.Sure, some of the action sequences will keep your interest. Milla's battle with some zombie dogs make the movie worth giving a chance if you have nothing better to do some evening. Still, the next time I decide to watch a zombie movie I think I will pick one that is a zombie movie all the way, and not one where the zombies were thrown in because the writers got bored.",5,0,0,22 September 2002
The Elephant Man," 'And who needs it more than us?'
","Despite the fact that 'The Elephant Man' is about a grossly deformed man, it is truly one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Director David Lynch has peered into the souls of both the 'outcasts' and those considered 'normal' in our society. Lynch has never been better, and the same may also be said about actors John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.Bytes is a would-be circus man who puts The Elephant Man/John Merrick (Hurt) on display in the freak show, attempting to profit from another man's misery. Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins) 'saves' Merrick from the evil Bytes, but what does he do with Merrick? Puts him on display in another freak show of sorts for a panel of doctors. Treves has again stripped Merrick of his dignity and tried to to profit from his misery. So who is worse? Bytes or Treves?And this is only the first 15 minutes of the film...What eventually saves Treves is that he actually gets to know Merrick. Behind the deformity he discovers a human being.There are so many beautiful and touching moments in this movie: Merrick's awe at watching the play, Merrick removing the pillows from his bed so he can sleep like a normal person and, of course, Merrick trapped at the train station and shouting out 'I am not an animal!'But my favorite moment comes when Merrick's fellow 'freaks' in the circus help him escape. As they put him on a ship so he can hopefully find his way back home, the dwarf (Kenny Baker) says to him 'Good luck, my friend. And who needs it more than us?'Filmed in gorgeous black and white. They don't come any better than this.",10,2,2,29 December 2000
Moulin Rouge!," Lots of razzle-dazzle, but where's the plot?
","I was totally enthralled by the first half hour of 'Moulin Rouge.' It's a pure razzle-dazzle, whiz-bang, spectacular spectacular with so much going on in each frame that your eyes scarcely know where to look. I began to think I was watching what would turn out to be my favorite movie of 2001.But razzle-dazzle can only hide the lack of a plot for so long. 45 minutes into the movie I began to look at my watch. And for the last hour I was reduced to simply hoping the movie would hurry up and end already.Oh, sure. It does have a plot. I guess. Unfortunately the plot is only a sappy love story that we already know the ending to. How do we know the ending? Because we are told it in the opening minute of the movie. Why are we told the ending at the beginning? That's a very good question.Still, 'Moulin Rouge' is a spectacular looking, well acted bit of razzle-dazzle that almost swept me away. Oh, for a real plot! Oh, for a real villain, instead of the non-threatening Duke who we are supposed to hate and fear! Oh, for an ending that could have kept me guessing! Had 'Moulin Rouge' had those things, it may very well have been picking up Oscar after Oscar come March.Instead, for me at least, it will remain only an intriguing curiosity.",6,0,1,27 December 2001
Life Is Beautiful," Pssst. Guess what? It's not supposed to be realistic!
","I'm surprised no one else has pointed out how 'Life is Beautiful' compares to 'Titanic.' (Okay, I haven't read all the reviews, but...) In both cases we have the proper woman who is supposed to marry the very proper man. Instead she falls for a vagabond; someone who is far from 'proper' but someone who definitely knows how to enjoy life. And in both cases the story is told against the backdrop of disaster.'Life is Beautiful,' however, is a fantasy. No, it could never really have happened. Yes, the Holocaust was far more horrible than this movie shows. But guess what? It's not supposed to be realistic! We already know how horrible the Holocaust was. That is not what this movie is about.Instead, this movie is about a father's love for his son, and how that father will do anything under any circumstance to protect that son.So Roberto Benigni, I say 'Bravisimo!'",Null,1,2,11 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Don't let the negative responses fool you, this film is incredible
","Instead of checking IDs at the theatre or the rental store when someone wants to see this movie, they should really ask the person the following question: Can you define what the title 'Eyes Wide Shut' means? If the person is able to give a sensible answer, then they should be allowed to see the film. If they can't, then they should be told 'Sorry, this isn't for you.'What 'Eyes Wide Shut' means, of course, is what we choose in life to ignore. Things we know darn well are true, but make us so uncomfortable that we ignore them and pretend they don't exist.When I was in college, there was a professor who everyone knew  demanded sex in return for good grades from some of his female students. No one would do anything about the situation. The truth was too uncomfortable. Everyone from the top administrators on down had their eyes wide shut to the problem.Homeless people are only homeless because they choose to be. Women who are raped were probably asking for it. People working in sweatshops for 50 cents a day really don't need that much money anyway and are doing just fine.Oh, yes. The movie. Tom Cruise's character has his eyes wide shut to many things in his marriage and in the world around him. A stray comment by his wife opens Tom's eyes for a while. He sees things in the world around him that he'd really rather not see. Will he keep his eyes wide open? Or will he shut them again?That is what the movie is about. And what an incredible movie it is, too.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
300," Trying way too hard to be an epic
","Movies are made in the spirit of their times. I always felt the original 1962 version of this story, 'The 300 Spartans,' suffered a bit too much from a forced cold war, communists vs. free world analogy. But then, it was 1962.'300,' on the other hand, is made with that modern day Hollywood belief that better special effects make better movies.This is a movie trying too hard to be an epic. No one can simply say lines, they have to make pronouncements. No shot is finished until some (needless) computer generated graphics are used. No character development is needed, just give this guy some lobster claws for hands and call it good.The tale of the 300 Spartans is classic and some of the magic of that story makes it through here. But modern day Hollywood has become so good at creating special effects that they forget about the basics of storytelling: plot and character. Give me the original 1962 movie, faults and all, over this over-wrought remake any day.",3,11,19,27 October 2007
