Requiem for a Dream," What shall we use...
","This movie is not about drugs. It is not about addiction. It is about the empty spaces in our pointless and meaningless lives and the things that we use to fill them. You see, our minds do not like emptiness and we are desperately looking for something that might help us to get rid of that emptiness along with the guilt and pain associated with it. Something that gives us the right to say 'I know who I am. My life has a purpose. I am here for a reason'. Whether they realized it or not, the people in the movie chose something to fill those spaces. Something they needed. Something that for a short period of time made their pain go away. Something that gave a meaning to their existence. In the end, they paid a terrible price for it. Sooner or later, we all do. The difference between us and the characters of this movie is that unlike them, we understand the consequences of your actions. At least we convinced ourselves so.  Do you think that your way to achieve happiness (or chemical balance in your brain) is the right one? See this movie. You will regret it though because it will make you face the reality for a moment. It will make you look at the choices that you made and reevaluate them. May God have mercy on your soul.",10,1,2,13 June 2001
