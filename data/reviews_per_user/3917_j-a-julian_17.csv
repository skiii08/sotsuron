Ford v Ferrari," This is a very Weak Year for Hollywood
",Well F v F is better than 1917 or Parasite but it's still a very ordinary movie. Worth watching but worthy of no awards. What a poor year for the film industry.,6,3,6,22 January 2020
The Equalizer," Another Mess by Antoine Fuqua
","First of all I made the mistake of seeing The Equalizer 2 before this film. #2 was terribly misdirected and virtually impossible to understand. Now that I've seen #1 I understand a bit more about #2 BUT sequels should be able to stand on their own and Fuqua totally failed on that point.Of course Denzel's performance is excellent as always but in general this, and #2, are simply not worth your time to watch. I cannot understand how Antoine Fuqua gets directing gigs.",3,1,4,2 March 2019
Hereditary," Total Waste of Time
",Terrible movie. Bad script. Poorly acted. Only redeeming factor is that Mallory Bechtel is hott.,1,2,6,11 January 2019
A Star Is Born," Two Movies in One
","This was quite an experience. Two movies in one. A great feel good movie about music. Constant great performances, really a feel good piece. Then it transitions. Dark. Frustrating. With about 30 minutes to go the end became obvious. My viewing was colored by the fact that my 20 year old daughter committed suicide after four year of intensive treatment by a multi-disciple medical team. It was so painful to see Jack slide down that slippery slope.Very well acted. Gaga was great. The direction was pretty good. It slowed in the middle of the movie and probably would be improved by a little editing. All in all a wonderful movie ... bring some tissues.",9,0,4,23 January 2019
Alexander," Terrible ...
","I just wasted more than 3 hours of my life. Because I respect film makers, I always watch the entire movie. I was greatly disappointed in this one.The MOST irritating aspect was the jumping time line. I don't know what Stone was trying to accomplish but it was extremely distracting. The second most irritating aspect was the length. The version I watched was about 3+15, waaaay too long.Very little character development ... maybe some for Alexander and his mother but virtually zero for the rest of the characters. Endless battle scenes that didn't add much.Potentially a great story and a huge budget ... Oliver blew it big time.Don't waste 3 hours of your life on this turkey.",1,0,2,9 May 2020
Aquaman," Major Disappointment
","CGI = 10
Plot = 1
Character Development = 1This is eye candy, not a movie to be respected. Likely a box office success because of all the hype. Disappointing ...",2,81,154,30 December 2018
The Doors," So Sad
","I'm a HUGE fan of the Doors. Jim and Ray were musical geniuses.Val Kilmer's performance is unbelievably excellent. It's a travesty that he was not nominated for an Oscar.I was a bit disappointed in the way Oliver Stone put this movie together. It's hard to place my finger on specifics, but I would have expected better.The movie made me so sad. Jim and I were born in the same year. I was in California in the 60's. I understand that time ... yet it makes me very sad. Such a great talent, totally consumed by alcohol and other drugs. Pam is not well developed in the film but her story is equally sad, killing herself with an overdose 3 years after Jim killed himself.I'm a forever fan of the great, but foolish, Jim Morrison.",8,1,1,8 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Boring ... the Franchise is Dead
","Not in the same league as the first few 'episodes' of Star Wars. Tries to evoke some of the old magic but fails miserably. Utterly boring. I almost always watch the whole movie, even the bad ones. This was one of the few I quit about an hour in. Don't waste your time.",1,10,20,15 February 2020
Saving Private Ryan," Hard to Rate ... been there
","The first 23 minutes of this film is rated at a 12.My good friend and I took our sons, 17 at the time, to see this in a theater. I am a senior military officer who experienced combat in 1967 - 68 - 69. We wanted the boys to see the horror of war, the slaughter.I have had to pack up the personal effects of my comrade to send back to his mother after he was killed in the Viet Nam war. Those of you who have not done this cannot even comprehend.After the opening combat scenes the film was an 8. Well done.War is hell and to those of us who have been there ... well I don't know what to say.Neither of our sons joined the military ... thank God.",10,20,23,31 December 2019
1917," Ponderous
","Ponderous and trite. Poorly directed, totally predictable. Hard to understand the buzz. I forced myself to watch the entire movie as I always do when I review. Recommend you skip this one. Totally panders to the PC anti-war Hollywood lefties ... don't get drawn in.",1,22,51,21 January 2020
Snowden," Well Done, Seriously Flawed
","It's Oliver Stone so of course it is a brilliantly crafted movie. That said, it's a powerful leftist propaganda piece that is likely to influence low information Americans. It depicts a well meaning young man who lacks perspective. Snowden is a criminal, but it's a great movie.So to meet the infantile ten line minimum ... I will repeat.It's Oliver Stone so of course it is a brilliantly crafted movie. That said, it's a powerful leftist propaganda piece that is likely to influence low information Americans. It depicts a well meaning young man who lacks perspective. Snowden is a criminal, but it's a great movie.",8,0,6,26 November 2016
12 Strong," What are these People Reviewing?
","As usual after I've seen a movie I check it out on IMDb. I was a little surprised to see the average review sitting at 6.6 so I started reading the reviews. The reviews are largely polarized with just a few in the middle. When you look at reviews under 5, and particularly the 1's and 2's, it's obvious that these lower reviews are, to a large extent, politically based. They tend to focus on negative portrayal of Afghans I didn't see that), overly positive portrayal of the special operators and cast doubts on the reliability of the plot. In other words, this movie, based on actual events, doesn't match the reviewers world view and therefore it must be a bad movie.Don't be taken it by this. It's actually a well done war movie that does a pretty good job of portraying the down in the dirt reality of war. The acting is straight forward and the characters are pretty true to life based on military folks that I know. I really recommend it. Now let's see if this review actually gets published ...",8,4,8,19 June 2018
Parasite," Seriously Flawed
","It is incomprehensible to me that this film is acclaimed and possibly heading for an Oscar.The primary flaw are the subtitles. The dialog has been translated by a poor cousin of Google Translate and NEVER reviewed by someone who speaks English. Grammar is out the window. Literal word translations miss the meaning. Subtitles are often flashed up so quickly that a native English speaker doesn't have time to read them.The result of this subtitle travesty is that the plot is very hard to understand, particularly the mid-movie plot twists. The overall plot is clear by the movie's end and decidedly unremarkable.The cinematography is excellent. The actors seem competent but reminiscent of Jackie Chan.Overall rating a one ... of course the Hollywood sophisticates will disagree. Don't bother watching this unless you understand Hangul.",1,22,84,20 January 2020
Wonder Woman," Terrible

The Silence of the Lambs," One of the few films that is a true ten
","Script, direction, performance .... impeccable. It's been more than 20 years since I've seen this film. Well worth watching again.",10,0,0,2 January 2020
Life," Well done with brilliant ending
",I am amazed at reviewers who say the ending is predictable and can be foreseen 30 minutes into the movie. Poppycock!The characters are well developed and each of the crew gives a reasonable to great performance.The ending is brilliant ... no spoilers here. Watch it!,9,5,9,1 February 2018
Goodfellas," Terrible Movie
","I just finished binge watching The Godfather trilogy and my expectations were high for Goodfellas. Goodfellas is not even in the same league as The Godfather Trilogy. Big names ... terrible acting. In need of a major edit to cut pointless material. The bits and pieces of the prime events are not connected in a cohesive manner. The movie just is not interesting and is vastly overrated. My advice, don't waste your time, the underrated Godfather 3 is a much better film.",2,0,10,19 September 2019
