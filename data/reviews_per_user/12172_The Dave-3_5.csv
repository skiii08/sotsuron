Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Force will be with us... ...maybe later
","I am happy to say that I was one of the privileged few out of the country to have seen this film the morning of May 19th (12:01 to be exact), without having to stand in line for more than 30 seconds.  I must say that the experience alone of seeing such a huge film with the crazed fanatics and the die-hard fans was more enjoyable than the film itself.Lucas has surely captivated the masses with his work, but I'm afraid that this one does not measrue up to the scope and raw power of the originals. There are THREE redeeming factors to this:  the spellbinding effects, Darth Maul, and John Williams rousing score.  The effects successfully encapstlate the audience into the rich, magical lands of the film.  Darth Maul is without a doubt (in my opinion) the greatest 'Star Wars' character of them all.  He is fast, furious, and a presence to reckon with on screen. Maul's light-saber fight with our heros is heightened greatly by John William's rendition of 'Duel of the Fates'.  Darth Maul's presence, William's music and superior choreography in the fight makes it the undisputed highlight of the film.Unlike Episodes 4, 5, and 6, the main characters of 'The Phantom Menace' are 2-dimensional and seem to have no REAL visible and tangible passion for what is unfolding in their lives.  While watching the movie work itself into the 'Star Wars' mold, it didn't quite seem to fit the rest of the saga.  The moments that foreshadowed the futures of the characters came off like a satire or a parody, and had no real visceral impact.All in all, Lucas is going to make more money from this excursion than Donald Trump wishes he could ever obtain.  If you are going into this film thinking it's the second coming of Christ, you are going to be disappointed. Although, if you want to be entertained in a way that only George Lucas can accomplish, and are a fan of the series, go see it.Note:  If you want to enjoy this film, tuck your inner-critic under your seat, and let the child within come out and play.",7,0,1,19 May 1999
Apocalypse Now," The Greatest Film of All Time
","This is not only the greatest WAR film of all time, but it is (in MY opinion) the greatest film EVER made.  So monumentally gargantuan in scope, this picture effortlessly handles the taboo topic of the hidden, dark side of mankind.  Each character is a pleasure to watch from Duvall's over-the-top 'Col. Kilgore', to Brando's broken, life-weary 'Col. Kurtz'. They all demonstrate a facet of humanity that sometimes brutally displays the utter beast that lies deep inside of all of us.  As far as a 'War' film goes, it is TOTALLY untouchable.  Films like 'Deer Hunter', 'Full Metal Jacket', and 'Platoon' are all great, but fall short of the greatness that 'Apocalypse Now' has acheived.  'Full Metal Jacket''s first half (the Marine training at Parris Island) is stunning and flawless.  Soon after though, it treads into territory that damn near noone can relate to.  Not everyone is a killing machine like 'Joker'.  You may say that noone can relate to 'Kurtz' but I seriously doubt that given the same circumstances, you would not be questioning the very fabric of humanity the way he does.  In 'Platoon' we are faced with incredible force, and great story, but muddled dialoge, and a sense of aloofness in our main character leave us at bay.You would also be hard-pressed to find a motion picture more beautifully filmed than 'Apocalypse Now'.  I've seen the cream of the crop as far as cinematography is concerned, and nothing comes close to Vittorio Stararo's breath-taking view of warfare.  This film is just candy to the eye for those who can appreciate quality filmmaking.  Many say that the film was 'incredible... ...up until Brando came in'.  To be honest, that is when the film came to its hightest point.  This is when the film REALLY challenged your REAL views on mankind.  I'm no pyscho, but I felt as though many of the declarations Col. Kurtz was making on humanity were right on.  Also, Dennis Hopper's eccentric, burnt-out photo journalist is a real treat to witness as slowly, Martin Sheen's 'Cpt. Willard' realizes he isn't all that different from them.Coppola declares himself that he didn't care for the ending very much.  It was the ending that will stay in my memory forever.  Talk about true power in cinema, NOW you have it.  I've never seen anything like it.  Even the breath-taking introduction of 'Saving Private Ryan' can't come close to the ending that Coppola didn't even intend to make.  Amazing.There are plenty of classic moments in this picture (the helicopter invasion to 'Flight of the Valkiries'; the 'mini May Li massacre' aboard the PBR; Willard's spiritual darkside in the hotel room at the beginning...) the list goes on and on.  Only in a film this great can people truly see themselves and the dark, remorse-less nature that we embody.  There is nothing that I have ever seen that will come close to this spellbinding movie experience.",10,0,0,24 March 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The Greatest 27 Minutes in Film History
","The first time I laid my eyes on this film (I have seen it about 10 times now), I was filled with awe and inspiration.  The 'transitional' wide-angle shot of the grunts being torn to peices just as the higgins boats reach the beach are the most horrifying (and at the same time) the most beautiful images I have ever seen on film.  The half-hour that follows (and I don't think that many will disagree with me) is flawless filmmaking. Unfortunately, that is the problem.  The first half-hour is SO damned strong in fact, that it is in MY opinion that the momentum of the rest of the film suffers in comparison.  Like 'Braveheart' and 'All Quiet on the Western Front', Speilberg showed his ideas through emotions and feelings rather than words.  I believe that was all accomplished in the first act of the film, leaving the rest of the picture to fend for itself.  What turned out to be a very intelligent move by Robert Rodat and Speilberg was to use each member of the squad to express an intruiging symbolic idea.  To me, that made upfor the lack of any solidity to the story-line that may have existed.  The level of violence and arbitrariness are without a doubt maxed out here, but at good cause.  ANYONE who knows ANYTHING about what unfolded on Omaha Beach that morning knows that it was a collosal bloodbath full of blood, guts, vomit, and death.  If you would read Steven Ambroses' 'D-Day' novel, you would actually realize that 'Saving Private Ryan' was just an edited version of what occurred that morning on the different sectors of Omaha Beach. Never-the-less, this film is a true repreasentation of raw power and gritty realism, that I am sure, will not be passed up for a long while in scope.",10,0,0,23 March 1999
Titanic," A 'Titanic' disappointment
","Only once in a great while, does a film of dynamic magnitude and power, grace the silver screen.  Unfortunatly, this is not one of those.  I can sum up the entire film with just ONE word: PRETENTIOUS.  The special effects are among the best I've seen, along with the cinematography and technical poise. This COULD of been a film of immense glory and scope, whisking us away on a beautiful journey, showing us humanity's undying spirit in the face of ultimate disaster.  Instead, James Cameron tries to replay 'Gone With The Wind' on a ship.  His efforts could have turned it all into a success if the characters weren't about as interesting as cardboard, and if the story was written by someone who didn't flunk 7th grade english.  The on-screen chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet was laughable at best.  I didn't believe for one second that they even LIKED each other, much less LOVE each other (they were both victims of an over-powering score by James Horner). They just didn't even look right for each other.  Maybe they should have 'beefed-up' DiCaprio so that he actually weighed over 100 pounds, or just found a different actor all together.  I just want to know what happened to the Leonardo DiCaprio from 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', or 'Basketball Diaries'.  While watching this film, I was wondering if Cameron was holding up cue cards behind the camera by the way he acted.  Kate Winslet was carried by her looks throughout the entire film; she IS gorgeous, but she could have put a little honest energy into the role, instead of it feeling forced out.You have to give it to Cameron, though.  He is a hell of a talented technical director (see 'Aliens', 'The Abyss', or the 'Termanitor' movies), and when it came time to sink the ship, he gave us one hell of a show. All in all, the 45 mintue climax couldn't float this sinking vessel.  How a film like this can win 11 Oscar's, and films of a much higher caliber (like 'Saving Private Ryan', and 'L.A. Confidential'), get snubbed? Sniff-Sniff...  ...I smell politics.",1,34,176,1 April 1999
Blade Runner," One of the greatest films of all time...
","From the start, when the somber score of Vangelis begins to thump in the backround, you are already being sucked into its thick atomsphere.  Then, the opening titles and prologue come to a close, to reveal in large print: Los Angeles November 2019. Then you are hit with it:  one the most stunning, incredibly elaborate, and dazzling visions of the future.Plagued with acid rain, fog, topless skyscrapers and endless advertisements we are now into the horrendously beautiful world of retired blade-runner unit Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford).  He is forced from retirement to hunt down 5 replicants (android units that incredibly resemble humans).  His mission:  to exterminate them.  The underlying theme here is the slow, methodical, destruction of ourselves (it has not been determined whether Deckard is a replicant as well).  That being the case, the film slowly molds itself into your psyche, where it will NEVER evacuate.It might as well be the most visually staggering motion picture of all time. To this day, I have NEVER seen any movie come close to the eerie reality of it's special effects (it got robbed that year by E.T.--which was one of the biggest mistakes in a long-line of mistakes that the academy has made). The visuals, writing and cinematography, EVERYTHING whisks you away into a gorgeous, harrowing world full of our own numbness to life and humanity.There are two different versions availible.  The standard cut and the Director's cut.  I strongly recommend the Director's cut (widescreen, of course), because it eliminates the original voice-over (making the film more quiet and menacing), and gets rid of the 'happy' ending (creating an amazing ominous feel to it).  I've said enough; I'll leave all of the characterizations for you to decide what you think...",10,0,1,25 March 1999
