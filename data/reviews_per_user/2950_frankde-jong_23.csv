The Sound of Music," A perfect double bill with 'Mary Poppins' (1964)
","Classical musical. The surroundings are a little to 'Milka' to my taste, but the songs are really evergreens.By accident I saw 'The sound of music' (1965, Robert Wise) and 'Marry Poppins' (1964, Robert Stevenson) a few days after each other. Both films obviously have much in common.
Both are from the mid '60s.
Both are musicals.
Both are about a nanny.
The nanny is in both cases played by Julie Andrews.
There are however also differences.The father has no time for his children in 'Marry Poppins' and perhaps too much time in 'The sound of music'.
The nanny is shy (at least initially) in 'The sound of music' and self-conscious in 'Mary Poppins'.
'The sound of music' is more about songs and 'Mary Poppins' is more about dance / choreography.
'The sound of music' has a political context whereas 'Mary Poppins' is Disney amusement.
Both films are good in their own way.",8,0,2,5 August 2019
Wind River," The chemistry between the two cops is a little paternalistic
","Taylor Sheridan likes to combine the Western genre with actual social engagement. In 'Hell or high water' (2016, David Mackenzie), for which he wrote the scenario, the film is situated in Texas and its theme is the banking crises of 2008. 'Wind river' (for which he wrote the scenario AND was the director) is situated in Wyoming and its theme is the difficult position of native Americans.Through the films of John Ford we identify Westerns with locations such as Monument valley. Personally I do like Westerns situated in the North of the United States very much. Think of films such as 'McCabe & Mrs Miller' (1971, Robert Altman) and 'The revenant' (2015, Alejandro Inarritu). 'Wind river' is one of those films, and the landscape is really beautiful. Good work of cinematographer Ben Richardson, who also shot 'Beasts of the Southern wild' (2012, Benh Zeitlin).The theme of the difficult possition of native Americans is illustrated by the case of the rape and murder of a young girl. The sheriff of the indian territory can only act as both the victim and the offender are native Americans. Against offenders from outside the territory he is powerless and needs the assistence of the FBI. Because of this a lot of crimes against native Americans remain unresolved.In 'Wind river' the assistence of the FBI comes in the form of an inexperienced female agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen). Her cooperation with the experienced local guy Cory Lambert (jeremy Renner) is the weak point of the movie. In many detective movies the tension between the experienced (local) cop and the inexperienced (but often better educated) cop from outside is one of the driving forces. During the movie not only the crime is solved but there also grows a mutual understanding and appreciation (for example 'In the heat of the night' (1967, Norman Jewison) and 'Mississippi burning' (1988, Alan Parker)). In 'Wind river' Jane Banner proves that she is brave, but she never really contributes to the solution of the crime. Combined with the fact that Jane is a woman, the film tends to a kind of paternalism.I already mentioned 'McCabe & Mrs Miller' (1971, Robert Altman). Only after seeing 'Wind river' one can value the utility of a brothel in such a lonely town in the North.",6,0,2,17 January 2020
Se7en," The seven sins of a serial killer
","'Seven' features a psychopath who is at least as convinced of his moral superiority and his mission to combat moral decay as Travis Bickle is in 'Taxi driver' (1976, Martin Scorsese). On top of that he structures his murders along the Biblical lines of the seven sins from the Apocalyps. In doing that he is not entirely consistent. In some cases the sinner is his victim (gluttony), in other cases he forces the sinner to be the murderer (lust).In search of the psychopath is a couple of detectives. This couple consists of, as in so many films before, an ambitious rookie and an old hand just before his retirement. This maybe a cliché, but 'Seven' nevertheless succeeds in giving it an original form. The rookie is looking for the usual evidence while the old hand is studying literature in the library in an attempt to unravel the twisted mind of the psychopath.",8,0,0,11 June 2019
The Fifth Element," A feast for the eyes
","On the continuum between form and substance 'The fifth element' stands firmly on the side of 'form'. Something not to be surprised of by a a director (the most successful director) of the 'Cinema du look' movement.The plot is paperthin but the images are terrific. The visual language looks very much like a comic book ('Kuifje' or 'TinTin), and I later read that this is indeed one of the sources of inspiration for director Luc Besson. The, often very strange, costumes were designed by the famous French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier. This was not the first time that this fashion designer contributed to a movie. Earlier examples are 'The cook, the thief, his wife & her lover' (1989, Peter Greenaway) and 'The city of lost children' (1995, Jean Pierre Jeunet).The film has hints of classic science fiction films such as 'Metropolis' (1927, Fritz Lang) and 'Blade runner' (1982, Ridley Scott), but takes itself less seriously. There are comic characters that in my opinion are a little silly (certainly after a while). Brilliant are the visual gags such as McDonalds and the Chinese take-away in the 23th century.According to Rogert Ebert the film is a bit to long, and I agree with him. To avoid this is in principle the job of the editor. One can imagine however the objections of director Besson when she cuts away very expensive scenes.",7,0,1,7 June 2020
Ed Wood," Making a film about the worst director ever is remarkable. Not ridiculing him and treating him with respect is great.
","It is possible to look at 'Ed Wood' as a sort of 'Sunset boulevard' (1950, Billy Wilder). In this case not Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is the actress in her final days but we are witnessing the end of the career of Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). Indeed, Martin Landau is one of the gems of 'Ed Wood' and rightly received an Oscar.It is also possible to look at 'Ed Wood' as a sort of 'Freaks' (1932, Tod Browning). It is hard to believe that the collection of eccentrics in 'Ed Wood' really were the casts of films such as 'Bride of the monster' (1955, Ed Wood) and 'Plan 9 from outer space' (1959, Ed Wood).Possibly the best films to compare 'Ed Wood' with are films such as 'Being there' (1979, Hal Ashby) and 'The hudsucker proxy' (1994, Ethan and Joel Coen). In all these films a man whose naivity is only surpassed by his enthusiasm is the main character. In 'Being there' this man rises to a responsible position by accident. In 'The hudsucker proxy' this man is (unsuccesfully) used as a strawman. In 'Ed Wood' the main character doesn't reach a responsible position at all. Instead Ed Wood has the dubious honor to be elected as the worst film director ever.The strongest point of the film is that it never ridicules its main character. Director Tim Burton treats Ed Wood really respectfully. He does so by emphasizing his enthusiasm above his incompetence. The film is also an ode to films of the 50's. Look at all the posters on the wall that come by during the film.In 'Ed Wood' Tim Burton proofs that a respectful treatment can be funny too. Look at the body language of Ed Wood and the 'no shaking' gradually morphing into a 'yes nodding' if a financier ones again makes impossible demands (such as asking the main role for his son or insisting that the film ends with an explosion). Look also at the meeting of Orson Welles (standing for the best director ever) and Ed Wood, both complaining about the way the Hollywood system treats them.",8,0,0,3 March 2020
Youth," Far more than dirty old men looking at naked young women (as the poster seems to imply)
","'Youth' (2015) is the second film of Paolo Sorrentino about old age and decay, after 'La grande bellezza' (2013). Both films make use of Fellini-esk extravaganza.'Youth' is an ironic title because the film is about a luxurious spa with a predominantly old clientele. Among the visitors are Mick Boyle, director of films (Harvey Keitel) and Fred Ballinger, composer of classical music (Michael Caine). Both men have different apporaches to the diminishing of their strenght and capabilities. Fred has fallen into apathy and abandons all activities. Mick is in full denial and swears that the best is yet to come. Michael Caine and Harvey Kietel both make the best out of their roles, contributing a lot to the quality of the film.Around this central duo various secondary characters are circling. In this respect the film has a resemblance with 'Magnolia' (1999, Paul Thomas Anderson), although there the central character was a man on his deathbed, a stage that Fred and Mick have not reached yet.The link between old age and decay and the character of Maradona (Roly Serrano) is obvious, but there are other secondary characters for which this link to the central theme is far from obvious. I am thinking about the silent couple and the masseuse with dental braces. The story line for the central couple is wafer-thin and actually a bit banal. The storyline for the masseuse does not exist at all (despite the fact that she reappears a couple of times in the film). This way these characters are reduced to set pieces and in this respect 'Youth' falls short of 'Magnolia'.",8,1,2,31 July 2019
Alien," Praise for director Ridley Scott but also for monster designer Hans Ruedi Giger
","In the wake of 'Star Wars' (1977, George Lucas) Ridley Scott made a science fiction film (his second film) situated in the cosmos. The story however has much in common with 'The thing from another world' (1951, Christian Nyby/Howard Hawks). Does it really matter if a group of people hunted by an alien life form is locked up in a spaceship ('Alien') or in an arctic outpost ('The thing from another world')?One of the strongest points of 'Alien' is the design of the monster. This design, a curious mixture of living creature and machine, was made by the Swiss artist Hans Ruedi Giger. Given this fantastic design it must have been a temptation for director Scott to show the monster as much as possible. Fortunately he managed to resist this temptation. Like Jacques Tourneur ('Cat people', 1942) Scott knew that suggestion can be as scary as explicit images.In 'Alien' relatively slow scenes are alternated with rapid action when this is least expected. To be specific I shall describe a couple of (famous) scenes. Unfortunately spoilers could not be entirely avoided in this descriptions.Scene 1: In the beginning of the film we get acquinted with the crew of the spaceship 'Nostromo'. The director takes time to introduce each crew member. The science fiction degree of the film is somewhat lessened by the ordinary way the crew has breakfast together. All this increases the bond the viewer has with the characters.
Scene 2: The expedition to the abandoned planet
is very beautifully photograped. It takes a long time before the nest with alien aggs is discoverd and out of one of these aggs a creature jumps on a crew member (Kane played by John Hurt) and sticks on his face.
Scene 3: The crew does not know how to remove the creature from the face of Kane. One day the creature has gone. The crew searches the sick bay (suspense) but nothing happens (Hitchcock principle). They only find the dead corps of the creature. This seems to be the end of this storyline but see what happens in ...
Scene 4: Maybe the most (in)famous scene in the film. It turns out that Kane has been iimpregnated by the creature and he gives suddenly birth to the alien. There is a lot of blood iin this 'birth scene' and because Scott had not told his actors about the details of the special effects not only the viewer but also the actors are (visibly) shocked.
Scene 5: Last but not least the attack on the crew member (Brett played by Harry Dean Stanton) who is looking for the cat of the spaceship. Brett s wandering through the spacecraft when he is surprised by the monster. The spacecraft is very big (it is a commercial vessel, a sort of space truck) and during the opening scene we have been watching how big it really is. Its interiors have an industrial outlook and during this scene there is water dripping from the ceiling. The scene thence gets a sort of Tarkovskian look and feel.Up till now I have mentioned the design of the monster, the design of the interiors of the spacecraft and the alternation between slow- and action scenes as the gems of the movie. Also the cast is very good. They succeed in creating credible characters and not mere astronauts. Special mention for Sigourney Weaver who plays a rather male like role as officer Ripley. She is formal, detached, status sensitive and in the end the only one to survive.",8,0,0,18 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," The last masterpiece of Francis Ford Coppola
","'Apocalypse now' is a film with a great reputation and a big influence. Many people know the sentence 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' without ever having seen the film. This reputation is partly due to the production history (a hell in itself) and the financing (Coppola financed the film himself and put the entire capital he had earned with the 'Godfather' films at stake). A diffucult production history however does not make in itself a good film.'Apocalypse now' has many facets, but in my opinion this is more a weakness then a strength of the movie.
As a Vietnam movie it is (in my opinion) surpassed by 'The deer hunter' (1978, Michael Cimino).
You may object that 'Apocalypse now' is not a pure Vietnam film and that the book on which it is based ('Heart of darkness', 1899, Joseph Conrad) is situated in Africa. True, 'Apocalypse now' is also an odyssey with a river as a metaphor, but also in this category I can think of a better movie ('The night of the hunter', 1955, Charles Laughton). Well done is the cinematography of Vittorio Storaro who makes the movie darker when it progresses.
In the third place the movie is about sinking into madness, but in this respect I can refer to a film like 'Aguire, der Zorn Gottes' (1972, Werner Herzog). By the way some characters are already very mad at the beginning of the fim (e.g. colonel Kilgore), it only makes one more curious after the madness of colonel Kurz and if this is the only reason why the US army is so interested in him?
Last but not least the film is about pagan religion. At the end of the film the book 'The golden bough, a study in magic and religion' (1890, J.G. Frazer) appears briefly on the screen. In this facet the movie outperforms a movie like 'The wicker man' (1973, Robin Hardy), but that is not a very hard thing to do. Regarding this respect I admired the brilliant close ups of the face of Marlon Brando very much. It was a bit of a disappointment to learn that one of the functions of these close ups was to keep his big belly of the screen.Above I criticized the film as a whole. The film however contains a couple of scenes that are indeed brilliant. Below I shall mention the scenes that striked me the most. 'Apocalypse now' has been released in three different versions (Original (1979), Redux (2001) and Final cut (2019)). This was possible because Coppola (as mentioned earlier) had financed the film himself, and was thus owner of the copyrights. Not al the critical scenes appear in all versions.
The most well known scene is without any doubt the helicopter-attack on the Vietnamese village with the 'Ride of the Walkure' music. The fact that Walkures take dead war heroes to Walhalla but do not kill them theselves makes the scene no less effective. 'Apocalypse now' is also the film (together with the popsong 'Good night Saigon' from Billy Joel) that makes the association between helicopters and the Vietnam war the most explicit (also 'The Doors' are mentioned in both film and song). What amazes me the most in this scene is that it really is beautiful when one sees the helicopters take off. The horror strikes only when the camera cuts to a Vietnamese schoolyard with playing children.
Also worth mentioning is the scene where all of the inhabitants of a Sampan are killed, just because a 17 years old American boy from the Bronx (that we have come to know as rather sympathetic) loses control of his nerves.
A second scene with the playmates was introduced in the redux version and again skipped in the final cut. The reason was that it would be too woman unfriendly, which is true. The remaining scene with the playmates is really revealing. Isn't it male unfriendly to sexually arouse adolescent boys so much that they forget that they are only cannon feed?
The final scene I would like to draw your attention to is the scene on the French plantation (only in the redux and final cut). Some find this scene to slow, others interpret the French inhabitants of the plantation as ghosts but I would like to draw your intention to the following quote of the French padre familias (ghost or human):
'We want to stay here because it's ours - it belongs to us. It keeps our family together. I mean, we fought for that. While you Americans... you are fighting for the biggest nothing in history!'In Vietnam the Americans confused a north-south conflict for an east - west coflict. They fought for the biggest nothing indeed.",7,1,2,30 December 2019
The Pianist," The most personal Polanski possible
","That the Second World War was cruel and barbaric is nothing new. A movie about this war with only battle scenes (how spectacular they might be) is therefore 'middle of the road'. To become a real classic war movie the film needs something special.This something special can be an 'extra', for example an unusual story line. Think of 'The best years of our lives' (1946, William Wyler) about reintegration of the soldiers in civil society, or 'Der Untergang' (2004, Oliver Hirschbiegel) about the last few days of Hitler sinking into (ever deeper) madness in his shelter in Berlin.In 'The pianist' the special element is the leaving out of all heroism. Pianist Szpilman (Adrien Brody) survives pure by accident. He is not a hero but a spectator. Polanski, who survived the Holocaust himself, knows what he is talking (filming) about. He refused to co-operate in 'Schindler's List' (1993, Steven Spielberg), a film in which heroism is an essential element.In 'The pianist' (piano)music is a powerfull antidote to barbarism. In his performance over the First World War the Dutch comedian Diederik van Vleuten tells the story of the French composer Maurice Ravel who writes a piece of pianomusic that can be played with the left arm only for the German pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in the First World War. In both wars pianomusic therefore softened the damages that the war has done.",7,0,1,10 June 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson at his best
","'The Grand Budapest Hotel' has the rather peculiar narrative structure of the double flash back. In the beginning of the movie we meet an old writer who remembers an interview he has hold when he was still young (flashback 1). In this interview an old man tells the story of his life (flashback 2).Just like in 'Moonrise Kingdom' (2012, Wes Anderson) the story seems an adaptation of an exciting boys book, but it is (even more) over the top. Wes Anderson likes his films to be artificial. In his opinion everybody knows that a film is fake and artificiality does not preclude identification.Being over the top the film has also something of a persiflage. The character of Jopling made me think of Anton Chigurgh from 'No country for old men' (2007, Joel and Ethan Coen). That was a persiflage of a Western but of what genre is 'The Grand Budapest hotel' a persiflage? At first I thought of Agatha Christie adaptations, the disagreement about the heritage of a person who was murdered being at the core of the plot. At second glance I think 'The Grand Budapest hotel' is a persiflage of Max Ophuls films, glorifying a society that definitely belongs to history.The world I am alluding to is the Habsburg double monarchy. This world is personified by monsieur Gustave, the hotel concierge who anticipates on the wishes of his (female) clients before they themselves are aware of them. Anderson himself has indicated that 'The Grand Budapest hotel' was not written but was certainly inspired by Stefan Zweig ('The world of yesterday, 1942). Maybe the writer in the film is Stephan Zweig?.Given this references to the Habsburg empire it was a bit of a surprise to me that the war in the film is not the First- but the Second World War. To give his actors a hint of the ambiance of the film he was aiming at Wes Anderson mentioned 'To be or not to be' (1942, Ernst Lubitsch), so it really is the Second World War. One of the others film he mentioned was, not surprisingly, 'Grand hotel' (1932, Edmund Goulding).In the present tense after flashback 1 (the time when the writer is still young en when the narrator is telling his story to him) the Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely in decay. The design is seventies at its worst and makes one think of that other famous film hotel': the Overlook hotel from 'The Shining' (1980, Stanley Kubrick).",9,0,0,28 December 2019
The Game," One of the best performances of Michael Douglas
","The beginning of the 'The game' is very stong. We see Michael Douglas as the self righteous, grumpy, egocentric (in short nasty) rich businessman Nicholas van Orton. Nobody likes this guy and that becomes extremely clear when he celebrates his 48th birthday all on his own in his big house watching CNN and eating a hamburger.A day later he gets a present from his brother. It is a ticket to a tailor made game. From then on the film tells the biblical story of Job, learning a rich man humility (apart from the fact that Job was rich but good from the beginning). The life of the control freak Van Orton is turned upside down and he seems to lose all his money. It is no coincidence that on the film poster his face disintegrates in the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.Director Fincher tells the Job story in a spectacular way. The fact that a crime element or a crime possibility is always lurking on the background maintains the tension. As a viewer you forget that the story is highly unprobable. The organisation of the game seems capable of 100% predicting the reactions of Van Orton. It almost seems like the detective Dupin in the Edgar Allan Poe story 'The murders in the Rue Morgue'.",7,0,0,13 December 2019
Cold War," The beautiful black and white photography is the main attraction of this film
","The romance has much in common with 'The unbearable lightness of being' (1988, Philip Kaufman). The political component does not equate the East - West contrast with evil versus good.Beautiful black and white photography from cinematographer Lukasz Zal.In comparison with 'Ida' (2013, Pawel Pawlikowski) 'Cold war' was for me a slight disappointment.",7,1,2,24 August 2019
The Graduate," Still a great movie, after all those years
","When 'The graduate' came out in the sixties it was a real sensation. In the first place in was the second noteworthy film of director Mike Nichols (after 'Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf' (1966)). Subsequently Nichols would fall back to a more mediocre director. In the second place it was the breaktrough of lead actor Dustin Hoffman. Finally the music of Simon and Garfunkel.At the moment 'The graduate' is viewed more critically. Was the acting of Dustin Hoffman really that great? Is the movie not terribly dated?With respect to the way that Dustin Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock there is a grain of truth. In retrospect Benjamin Braddock seems to be a Raymond Babbitt light ('Rain Man' (1988, Barry Levinson)). It is also difficult to understand why both Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) succumb to the (non existent) charms of the socially awkward Benjamin.I do however totally disagree with the opinion that 'The graduate' is a dated movie. The 'graduate' is not a hippie film (like for example 'Easy rider' (1969, Dennis Hopper)) but a coming of age movie, and as that not bound to a particular decade. It is a good coming af age movie thereto. It is not about a main character craving for sex. In stead of that Benjamin Braddock is fascinated by sex, fear forming an integral part of that fascination (seducing scene). Benjamin Braddock does not have definite ideas about his future, but he knows for sure it is not the future his parents are planning for him. In the end Benjamin Braddock and Elaine Robinson are sitting in the bus, riding towards a completely unknown future. This open end is both beautiful and in harmony with the ambiance of the rest of the film.There are other beautiful scenes, like for example the first date of Benjamin and Elaine. Benjamin feels very embarrassed about this date. It is forced upon him by Mr Robinson while at the same time he is having an affair with Mrs Robinson. He cools down his anger by taking revenge on the innocent Elaine. He takes her to striptease bar, not out of habit (such as Travis Bickle with Betsy in 'Taxi driver' (1976, Martin Scorsese)) but purposefully being rude. When Elaine asks him why he hates her so and starts to cry, the scene becomes very discomforting and beautiful at the same time.All in all, 'The graduate' is still a great film after all these years. Maybe it is time to recalibrate the contribution that respectively Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft have made to this greatness.",9,0,0,16 March 2020
Pretty Woman," A modern fairy tail
","'Pretty woman' is a modern fairy tail evidently based on the story of Pygmalion (1913, George Bernard Shaw) c.q. the film 'My fair lady' (1964, George Cukor).The film thanks much of its success to the chemistry between arrivÃ© Richard Gere and rising star Julia Roberts.Much of the charm of the Pygmalion story lies in the mutual influence of refined gentleman and woman of the street. In the first half of 'Pretty woman' the influence seems rather one sided, nemely from gentleman to streetwalker. The reverse influence only gets going in the second half of the film.Even then the story is not wholly unambigious. Is the softening of the tough businessman Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) really attributabe to Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) or has he found a stepfather in the general manager of the company he wants to buy and strip?",7,1,1,2 July 2019
Some Like It Hot," Billy Wilders has a perfect command over the screwball genre
","In my review of 'Parasite' (2019, Bong Joon Ho) I said that mixing crime and comedy is best done by Joel and Ethan Coen. Now I have to admit that also Billy Wilder understands this job.In 'Some like it hot' the mix is heavily tilted towards comedy, the role of crime being limited to giving an inducement. But that does not diminish the achievement of Wilder in any way. I have long evaded this film because I am not a great lover of comedy's with men in women's cloth. They tend to be rather silly ans insiped. Think of films as 'Tootsie' (1982, Sydney Pollack) and 'Mrs Doubtfire' (1993, Chris Columbus) not to speak of a play like 'Charlie's aunt'. It is the merit of Billy Wilder but also of his main actors that they make such a funny film out of such an antiquated concept. When the story moves from Chicago to the seaside of Florida it almost becomes a naughty version of 'Les vacances de Mrs Hulot' (1953, Jacques Tati).I already mentioned the main actors. They all did a splendid job. Jack Lemmon was at the peak of his career and would make 'The apartment' the next year (aslo with Billy Wilder). Tony Curtis, often casted for his good looks in the beginning of his career, had proven his ability for serious acting in 'Sweet smell of success' (1957, Alexander Mackendrick) and 'The defiant ones' (1958, Stanley Kramer) in the previous years. For Marilyn Monroe it is one of her last appearances. She is still sexy and innocent at the same time, as if fully unaware of the effect that her body has on men. In 'Some like it hot' she sings 'I wanna be loved by you' in a very sensuous way, dressed in a robe that shows (almost offers) her breasts in the most advantageous way.During the film two relationships evolve. One is between Jack Lemon as Daphne and Joe Brown as an old millionaire. In this relationship Joe does not know that Daphne in reality is a man. This relationship is hardcore screwball, but on a very high level. The other relationship is between Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane and Tony Curtis playing a fake milliionaire. In this relationship Marilyn does not know that Tony Curtis in reality doesn't have a dime. This relationship outgrows the screwball character and even becomes a real romance. Especially poignant is that the Marilyn Monroe character says she always falls in love with the wrong men and is finally looking for a serious and quiet one. Just as in real life one is inclined to think.",8,0,0,31 December 2019
The Witch," An horror movie with gives much attention to period details
","When 'The lighthouse' (2019, Robert Eggers) came out I intended to see also his debut film 'The witch' (2015). When 'The lighthouse' turned out to be a disappointment I began to doubt if I would still see 'The witch'. After all I am glad I have done it. 'The witch', which has much in common with the Estonian film 'November' (2017, Rainer Sarnet), is a more subdued and a better film than 'The lighthouse'.'The witch' has been carefully made. Much effort has been put in getting the period details right. One example of this is the use of antiquated language.This attention for period details has made 'The witch' into a multi layered film. Layer 1 has to do with the extent to which the events are shocking for the viewer. Layer 2 concerns the extent to which the events are shocking to the main characters. With respect to layer 2 one has to consider that the main characters are deeply religious people for whom there is no real difference between the natural world and the supernatural world.The fear for the devil is for them very real. Because the devil can appear in various manifestations (including taking possession of a human being), this fear gives rise to a growing sense of distrust within the family. This fear and the resulting distrust in layer 2 makes the film more tense in layer 1. One can see the same effect in science fiction films in which an alien can take on a human form. See for example 'The invasion of the body snatchers' (1956, Don Siegel) or 'The thing' (1982, John Carpenter).",7,0,1,13 March 2020
There Will Be Blood," A film reminding of Citizen Kane
","'There will be blood' is about the rise of the oil industrie in America (like 'Giant' (1956, George Stevens)) and about the rise and fall of a tycoon (like 'Citizen Kane' (1941, Orosen Welles)). So the film can be compared with not the least of films in film history. Nevertheless it withstands this comparison rather well.Central to the film is the conflict between the tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) and the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). This is however not a conflict of principles. Eli Sunday is also interested in money and for Daniel Plainview oil is a holy substance. This is illustrated by the way he baptizes his stepson H.W. with oil. The conflict is rather a powerstruggle in the course of which the two combatants mutually humiliate each other.H.W. is the stepson of Daniel Plainview. They have a rather curious relationship. For Daniel his stepson is a way te present himself as a family man (a necessary condition to do business in this very religious part of America), something he definitely is not. H.W. made me think of Oskar Matzerath from 'Die blechtrommel' (1979, Volker SchlÃ¶ndorf), although he does grow up. As a grown up he disappears however from the scene.Both Daniel and Eli have 'the gift of speech', and they use it to cheat on the farmers of the neigborhood. The voice of Daniel is so confidence inspiring that it can only belong to a crook. The film starts with a long silent opening, after which there is a speech of Daniel trying to buy the land of farmers in order to drill for oil.The cinematography is very beautiful, in particular in the scenes of wide landscapes. Landscapes who will be damaged forever by the activities of Daniel Plainview. Coincidentally the Coen brothers filmed in the same part of Texas as Paul Thomas Anderson for 'No country for old men', a film from the same year (2007).The score sounds very much like a Philip Glass score, but is actually by Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead. There are dissonants in the music by uncomfortable scenes in which the hard selfishness of Daniel Plainview is revealed.In 'Citizen Kane' there is some sort of redemption at the end. In 'There will be blood' there is only madness.",9,2,2,15 February 2020
Jaws," Two great stories in one film
","The film 'Jaws' actually consists of two story's.The second story is the story of the hunt. This story builds on 'Moby Dick' (1956, John Huston). In effect the character of Quint in Jaws resembles to a great extent that of Captain Ahab in Moby Dick. The attraction of the second story is the interaction between the totally different old sailor Quint (Robert Shaw), Brody (Roy Scheider) as the local sheriff who is afraid of water and the scientific Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss). Spielberg takes his time to introduce these characters to us. The best scene in the second story is the one in which the three of them sit slightly drunk in the cabin of the boat, bragging about their scars and the heroic stories behind them. This scene is also a well timed interlude between all the actions scenes in the second story.The first story is the story of Amity Island, and how the local tourist industry does not want to face the facts about the shark. For the mayor of the city the interests of the local economy far outweight the risks for the tourists. After the first casualty he succeeds in convincing the sheriff to not shutt down the beach and only after the second casualty action is taken. The best scene of this story is between the first and the second casualty. The sheriff knows the danger, the beach guests do not. The sheriff tries to be as alert as possible, the beach guests are whining about details.In this scene at the beach Spielberg shows his mastery as a storyteller. He uses striking swimwear to draw our attention to specifc beach guests. He uses a cameratechnique of zooming out / tracking forward when the inevitable accident finally strikes. I only know this cameratechnique from 'Vertigo' (1958, Alfred Hitchcock), in this film to illustrate the fear of height of Scottie.'Jaws' was the breakthrough-film of Spielberg. It was also the breakthrough of the summer blockbuster (summer was up till then considered a lukewarm filming season). During the production stage of Jaws the mechanical shark was not functioning well. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Spielberg decided in a lot of scenes not to show the shark directly but either indirectly or not at all. That suggestion is often more effective than images is known since 'Cat people' (1942, Jacques Tourneur), 'Jaws' reconfirmes this 'film law' ones again.In the end 'Jaws' is in my opinion the film of Sheriff Brody. In story 1 he succumbs under the pressure and does not take the necessary actions. For this he is reproached by the mother of the second casualty. In story 2 he overcomes his fear for water and is ultimately the one who eliminates the shark.",9,2,3,26 April 2020
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Disneys ultimate classic
","Disney classic and great leap forward in animation.Snowwhite and Prince charming maybe the main characters, they are to perfect to be interesting. The seven dwarfs, with al their (all too human) imperfections are much more fun to watch.Just like in the fairy tale of Little Red Riding Hood Snowwhite contains symbolism that stand for the awakening of a young girl. Think of the magic sleep and the kiss of the prince that breaks the spell. We also see the same symbolism in the Wagner opera 'Ring des Nibelungen' (Brunhilde = Snowwhite and Siegfried = the Prince).",8,1,1,27 July 2019
Parasite," A strange mix of genre styles (social drama, thriller and comedy all in one)
","The appreciation for 'Parasite' is I think partially dependent on the expectations that you have in advance.I expected to see a movie in line with 'The handmaiden' (2016, Chan Wook Park) or (an older example) 'The servant' (1963, Joseph Losey) where the servants gradually take over the power. My expectations where also rather high given the ecxellent South Korean thriller 'Burning' (2018, Chang Dong Lee) that I saw recently. Both films share the same cinematographer (Kyung Pyo Hong).My expectations where not fulfilled. There is no slow change in the power balance between masters and servants but the cunning servants overwhelm their naive masters in a breathtaking tempo. In this stage the film has a caricatural / comedy element in it that was not to my taste. It is rather difficult to combine the crime and comedy genres, and only the Coen brothers (for example 'Fargo' 1996) are able to do this job well.One can also see the film in an entirely different way, namely as a social drama about the gap between rich and poor. In 'Parasite' the rich and the poor are geographically seperated. The poor are living downhill and the rich are living in the upper parts of town. In film such a setting has ancient origins. Think about a classic as 'Metropolis' (1927, Frits Lang). The subject of the gap between rich and poor is however still actual (think of the writings of the economist Thomas Piketty). At the same time as 'Parasite' the latest film of Ken Loach was released ('Sorry, we missed you'). In 'Parasite' the underdogs of society are not so honest as in 'Sorry, we missed you' and (controray to the combination crime / comedy) the combination social drama / comedy works well. It makes the film less moralizing.I like to mention one element in the film that is easily overlooked but has for me a symbolic meaning. At a certain point in the film the masters notice that their servants all have the same stuffy smell. This smell comes from their damp apartment downtown. The symbolic meaning for me was that the servants are judged after their origin and not after their capabilities. In this way there is no upside social potential and the society becomes static. Success is inheritable.The youngest son of the masters is a bit strange and likes to be in the garden when the rain is pouring. Visually this gives rise to some scenes that made me think of 'Prejudice' (2015, Antoine Cuypers).",7,2,6,8 December 2019
Ran," The last great film of Kurosawa
","'Ran' was made by Kurosawa when he was already 75 years old. It is his last great film.
Kurosawa had a long career, but it was interspersed with difficult periods of 'writers block'. Therefore finding funding for his films was noy always easy, especially in the second half of his career. 'Dersu Uzala' (1975) was financed with Russian money and 'Ran' (1985) with French money.From the three great Japanese directors after the Second World War (Ozu, Mizoguchi and Kurosawa) Kurosawa was the most Western one. The cultural influence went in both directions. Kurosawa had an influence on Western filmmaking. 'The magnificent seven' (1960, John Sturges) was a remake of 'Seven Samurai' (1954, Akira Kurosawa). On the other hand Kurosawa was inspired by Western literature, most notably by Shakespeare. Stange as it may sound Kurosawa is one of the most prominent Shakespeare adapters under the film directors. He brought MacBeth ('Throne of blood', 1957), Hamlet ('The bad sleep well', 1960) and King Lear ('Ran', 1985) to the screen.King Lear is a pessimistic story in which a father is cheated by his elder sons. Only his youngest son remains faithful to him. In 'Ran' the difference is visualised in the landscape. When the father is with his youngest son, the landscape is green. When the father is with the other sons, the landscape is black and consists of a volcanic type of sand. This black landscape is ideal for the fighting scenes because it provides a perfect background for the colorful banners of the different armies.The last scene is mindbogling but also not easy to forget. A blind man is all on his own, staying on the edge of a cliff. In essence he can't make another step.",9,0,0,10 May 2020
All the President's Men," A piece of old fashioned journalism in a time of fact free social media
","The film starts with the burglary in the Watergate building (head office of the democratic party). After this piece of action the rest of the film is all talking and dialogue. It is a miracle that director Pakula has made the film nevertheless so thrilling (given the fact that we all know how the Watergate scandal will end).The film is really about two subjects: (1) The Watergate scandal and (2) journalism as a profession.To start with the second subject. Despite the fact that the two journalist are played by the stars Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, they are never portrayed as hero's. Journalism is hard work with many false clue's and silent witnesses. I remember one scene in the Congress library where Woodward and Bernstein are sifting out al the requests (on paper, we are talking about the pre computer era) for books by a person they suspect. It reminded me of a library scene in 'The day of the jackall' (1973, Fred Zinnemann) (although in that scene a contract killer is doing research on his next victim). On top of that is the ever lasting fight for the big scoop. A fight that is fought between Woodward and Bernstein (at first), between Woodstein and the rest of the eidtors of the Washington Post and last but not least between the Washington Post and the New York Times. All in all valuable to see this piece of old school journalism in times of fact free social media.After the arrest of the burglars in the Watergate building the Watergate scandal was not immediately front page news. It was more a peat fire maintained by Woodward and Bernstein. The film is about the first stage of the Watergate scandal. The period from june 1972 (the arrest) to january 1973 (inauguration from Nixon for his second term). It was not until august 1974 before Nixon would resign. In 'All the presidents men' we learn about 'deep throat', but we hear nothing about the White house tapes. I always asked myself the question why Nixon needed the faul play in the election of 1972. After all his opponent was George McGovern, who had really no chance (also without faul play). The reason maybe be sought in the character of Nixon (see 'Nixon' (1995, Oliver Stone)). 'All the presidents men' gives however a different answer. The Watergate burglary was part of a broader program of interference with the Democratic primaries. So was Edmund Muskie (an opponent who was far more dangerous to Nixon than George McGovern) discredited a few years earlier by a fake letter. The Watergate scandal and what it has to say about campaign financing is still relevant in the Trump era.Up till now I commented mainly on the content of the movie. A movie who was also beautifully made. A already said something about director Pakula (made dialogue thrilling), about the actors Redford and Hoffman (made rightfully no hero's of their characters). Let me end with saying something about cinematographer Gordon Willes, which we all know from the 'Godfathers' movies. Gordon Willes nickname is 'Prince of darnkess' and that made him the right person to shoot the 'deep throat scenes'.",8,2,2,7 August 2019
The Wizard of Oz," An all time classic
","A fairy tale American style. The moral of the story is 'East West Home's Best'.It seems to be that the characters in Oz are enlarged equivalents of persons that Dorothy knows at home, at the farm in Kansas.It is for sure that the wizard of Oz turns out to be a charlatan. Although the director will not have intended it that way, anno 2019 the comparison presents itself with the numerous populist politicians, promising a better and above all more simple world.",8,0,1,4 August 2019
