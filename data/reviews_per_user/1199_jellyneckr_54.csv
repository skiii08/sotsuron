The Benchwarmers," The best baseball comedy since Major League!
","It all started in 1999. Adam Sandler, at the hieght of his popularity, decided to help old pal Rob Schneider out by producing DEUCE BIGELOW: MALE GIGOLO. That film was surprisingly a hit so Sandler took the next logical step and produced a film for another SNL buddy, David Spade. JOE DIRT, while not the commericial success 'BIGELO' was did great in DVD sales and has since gained cult statuts. Sandler has continued to produce projects for both Schneider and Spade over the years so it seemed inevitable that the two would end up starring in a Sandler produced film together. THE BENCHWARMERS teams Schneider and Spade with Jon Heder, best known for starring in the worst comedy of the 2000s NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. The three play pals who after beating a bunch of little bullies at a baseball game discover that they could make a living doing so while standing up to bullies in the process. The plot and most of the characters are secondary to the rapid-fire slapstick and gross-out gags, 85% of which hit. When the gags do fail, it's due to Heder. He does well in his role for the most part, but at times it seems like he's still in Napoleon Dynamite mode. While some more backstory into his character's life and Ritchie's (David Spade) life would have made the movie more filling, they still aren't the usual one-dimensional characters the audience is used to seeing in most flicks these days, which is ultimately why I recommend it. 8/10",Null,16,33,22 April 2006
Alien 3," Could have been just as good as the first two had it had a better director
","In my comment for ALIEN, I referred to ALIEN 3 as awful. After re-watching the film a second time, I now have come to realize that is not awful like I once thought, it's horrendous beyond belief. It ultimately suffers from a poor choice for director. David Fincher has his fans, but I have never quite warmed up to his style. Like Tim Burton, his style is an acquired taste. His style certainly doesn't fit ALIEN 3. In his feature film debut, Fincher directs as if he was directing one of his music videos, which damages the picture beyond repair. It comes across as if MTV was behind it. There are those who will say I am being unfair to Fincher since he walked off the project before editing even began and the production was an extremely troubled one, but regardless of how much studio interference comes into play, he ultimately was the man behind the camera and its his directing that makes ALIEN 3 the worst in the series. Fox should have put a more experienced director at the helm. As much as I hated the directing, the script is actually okay. In fact, had Walter Hill directed from the script he co-wrote, I have a feeling ALIEN 3 could have been just as good as the first two in the series. There are some good lines, and some intelligent ideas. It's a case where the script is better than the movie itself. 1/10",Null,296,310,12 January 2006
The Longest Yard," Peter Segal's best film since TOMMY BOY
","In 1994, Peter Segal made his feature film directorial debut with NAKED GUN 33 1/3: THE FINAL INSULT, the hilarious concluding chapter of the NAKED GUN series. His follow-up was the even funnier TOMMY BOY in 1995, one of the best comedies of the 1990s. His next film, MY FELLOW Americans, was pretty funny but failed to generate the same number of laughs as his two previous films. Still, it seemed like Segal was destined to become one of the next great comedy directors. That is until 2000's NUTTY PROFESSOR II: THE KLUMPS, a lame rehash of the 1996 remake. Since then, he's continued to direct pretty mediocre comedies like ANGER MANAGEMENT and 50 FIRST DATES so I had low expectations when I heard he was to direct the THE LONGEST YARD. Luckily, THE LONGEST YARD, his latest movie, is his best film since TOMMY BOY thanks to Segal's great comedic direction. In addition to handling the comedy well, he also does a fantastic job with the football scenes. In fact, I think it is safe to say that because of Segal's direction, THE LONGEST YARD is the best football film of the 2000s so far.Anybody that knows me knows that if there is one type of movie I hate, it's remakes. There is no reason for them, making them pointless. However, for whatever reason, I actually enjoyed this one. From the great opening shot of a beautiful girl swimming in a pool to the very last shot of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) getting Gatorade poured all over him, I found myself having a ball. It's just an all around fun film. Everyone does a great job with their roles (especially Sandler and Rock) and for an almost two hour movie, THE LONGEST YARD is fast-paced.Still, THE LONGEST YARD has its fair share of problems. The rap sound track doesn't seem to fit the picture very well, some of the jokes fall pretty flat(i.e. most of the gay jokes), and there's not nearly as much character development as there was in the original. Despite these flaws, THE LONGEST YARD remains one of the highlights of 2005. Recommended.",Null,22,47,28 May 2005
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Absolutely terrible
","Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter has one of the most absurd concepts of all time. The entire plot is goofy, dumb, and almost impossible to get behind. Yet somehow the novel managed to be an interesting if not entirely successful story that was way better than it could have been. It was also written very cinematically so it wasn't hard to imagine how a solid adaptation could have been produced. Unfortunately, the resulting film version is such a colossal mess that it's almost indescribable, mainly due some mind-bogglingly atrocious editing. The editing is amongst the worst I've ever seen in a studio production. Every scene is borderline incoherent as if the entire picture was cut together in a matter of days. I don't know if director Timur Bekmambetov had the right to final cut so I'll avoid placing blame on any one particular person. However, it would not surprise me at all if the director eventually reveals that the movie was released not completely finished. It's the only possible explanation for why everything is astonishingly sloppy. Each scene seems to be truncated to the shortest length possible, resulting in an extremely, extremely rushed pace. I doubt there are more than a few scenes that last more than a minute, making the entire film seem like one disjointed montage. Characters appear in scenes and disappear within seconds (this is especially true with Alan Tudyk's Stephen Douglas, who is probably on screen for 75 seconds at most). Even usually solid performers like Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln and Jimmi Simpson as Joshua Speed are reduced to probably less than ten minutes of screen time despite the fact that they are supposedly two of the most important characters in the story. Needless to say that because of the disastrous editing, there is not a single cast member that is able to leave much of any impression, including Benjamin Walker himself as Abe Lincoln. Unfortunately, the poor editing choices also sabotage the action sequences. Looking like the worst possible version of a Zach Snyder movie, each 'action' scene is filled with non-stop slow motion/fast motion nonsense, too much emphasis on over-stylization, and more instances of horrible CGI than any movie in recent memory. All this renders the scenes completely ineffective with barely a moment of genuine excitement despite all the vampire-slaying on display. Those hoping for gore will be disappointed to know that despite being R-rated, there is hardly any blood and the blood that is visible looks less convincing and scary than cough syrup. Honestly, there isn't anything very positive that can be said about the flick. As an adaptation, it's unfaithful and lifeless. It also doesn't fit into a particular genre: it doesn't even try to be scary enough to count as a horror pic, it's too inert to be considered an action-adventure, and the tone is so humorless that in no way can it be considered a comedy. While Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is not the worst I've ever seen, it's certainly one of the very worst of 2012 and definitely not recommended. 2/10",Null,3,7,31 October 2012
Wayne's World," PARTY TIME! EXCELLENT!
","Although not nearly as funny now as it was when it was first released in 1992, WAYNE'S WORLD is a definite classic and is one of the funniest movies of the 1990's. The comedic performances by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are brilliant. Dana Carvery is one of the wittiest stand-up comedians ever, and that is shown in his ad-lib in the scene when they are on top of the car watching the airplane overhead, which is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. WAYNE'S WORLD is a party-hard movie filled with memorable lines. It may not be the best movie based on a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch (that would be THE LADIES MAN), but it still is one of the better comedies to come out in the past fifteen years. ***",Null,0,3,16 June 2004
Underworld," One of the coolest and stylish films of the 2000s so far!
","As much as I love vampire and werewolf movies, I had my doubts about seeing UNDERWORLD upon its release in the Fall of 2003. It had a first time director, a writer whose only credit was an episode of 'The Outer Limits', and Kate Beckinsale in the lead role, who hadn't exactly won me over with her performance in PEARL HARBOR. It certainly seemed like it could end up being a total stinker. To my surprise, I found myself loving UNDERWORLD when I got around to seeing it on DVD. I had been wrong about everything. Director Len Wiseman proved to be an excellent director, bringing a strong visual and kick-ass style to the picture that made it seem like a spin-off of BLADE. Danny McBride's screenplay is smart and extremely interesting. But what I was really wrong about was Kate Beckinsale. Wow! Here she proves not only is she sexy, she can actually act as well! Some of the other performances aren't up to par. Scott Speedman is okay, though didn't seem particularly right for the role he was playing while the less said about Shane Brolly's performance, the better. The other main flaw of the film is that it runs too long. What should have been a fast and exciting 90 to 100 minute seems padded and is dull in spaces. Thankfully, these flaws don't completely ruin UNDERWORLD. It remains one of the coolest and stylish films of the 2000s so far! Hopefully the upcoming sequel will be ever better. 8/10",Null,2,3,19 January 2006
Blade," Good vampire movie
","From the previews, BLADE seems like just another violent gore fest, but it is actually more than that. It is an extremely entertaining action/horror movie that is full of jaw-dropping special effects, good performances, great directing, (due to the fabulous Stephen Norrington), and a fascinating plot. It isn't your average vampire movie. It's a comic book movie geared more toward adults than kids and it's a very bloody one too. The blood didn't bother me, but the two hour running time and the terrible acting by N'Bushe Wright did. Highlights include the opening scene, the final fight scene, and any scene with Donal Logue. 7/10",Null,1,3,18 July 2005
Creed," Best film of 2015
","By all accounts, the Rocky series came to a satisfying conclusion with 2006's Rocky Balboa. Critics called the film one of the best in the series, there was a higher box office total than one should have expected, and fans (myself included) were, for the most part, generally happy with the picture as a final chapter. When Creed was announced, it seemed likely that the final product would be little more than a cash crab, or a desperate attempt to bring back a series best left in the past.To almost everyone's surprise, Creed is just as great, if not even better, than Rocky Balboa. It may even be the best in the series. If nothing else, Creed is, without a doubt, the best seventh installment of any film series. Everything from the writing to the production design is impressive, made with love and care for a franchise that is almost 40 years old at this point. It would have been easy for co-writer/director Ryan Coogler to essentially remake the first Rocky with a new character, but he's too smart to just shoot a lazy sequel. Creed may share a few story beats from the original Rocky here and there, although 90% of the film is an original boxing story that just happens to feature Stallone as an aging, tired Rocky Balboa.Stallone gets a lot of criticism for some of his acting and career choices, and some of it may occasionally be justified but there's nothing to criticize in Creed. Stallone is as impressive here as he's ever been, delivering an absolutely knockout performance as the legend who has seen almost everything good in his life disappear. It is a sad, at times beautiful performance that makes Rocky feel like a more realistic character than ever before. Stallone has nice chemistry with Michael B. Jordan, playing Adonis Creed, Apollo's son. Even taking a backseat as a supporting character, Stallone could have completely overshadowed Jordan--it is, after all, still a Rocky movie--but both share the screen and are electrifying to watch together. Jordan has to display a wide arrange of emotions throughout: sadness, anger, grief, and they are done in such a way that he always remains a sympathetic character even when he's being a less than likable guy.Creed is so great that the only real disappointment is that it doesn't run slightly longer, which is something that I never say about a film. It's an amazing accomplishment from such a young director, and an absolute delight for anyone who has ever been a Rocky fan. Creed is by far the best movie to have come out in 2015. 9/10",Null,1,5,14 January 2016
Hot Fuzz," The best movie in years!
","It must be stated before all else that I am not a fan of British entertainment. I never have been. It's nothing against the British, I guess I among those who just don't get it. The distinction between this particular piece of British entertainment, a satirical action picture brilliantly titled Hot Fuzz, is although the production may be British, the target of parody is something uniquely American: the big-budget, loud, and often times not very good action picture.Like most guys in the 18-29 demographic, I find almost nothing as fun as watching a bloody, explosion-filled, and for some, headache-inducing testosterone-driven ninety minutes of excitement in a dark movie theater (although with DVD these days, it's almost just as much fun at home). Unfortunately, there's often more brains being blown up on screen than brains being put to use behind the camera. Hot Fuzz is perhaps the first action extravaganza in years to have thought, story, and characters to go along with the mayhem. Those not familiar with the staples of the genre will most likely be lost, but for those who have grown up on a steady diet of Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and the other action franchises of the last twenty years will probably be left breathless. Even my mother, who is not a fan of violent action, found it to be brilliant satire. A big part of what is be satirized is the unintentional romanticized buddy conventions of action epics, so Hot Fuzz like Edgar Wright's previous masterpiece Shaun of the Dead, often plays out like a romantic comedy. Use that logic with your girlfriend and you may have a date to the best movie in years. 10/10",Null,2,4,22 April 2007
The Mummy," Not as good as the sequel, but still pretty entertaining
","While THE MUMMY is not nearly as good as THE MUMMY RETURNS, it is still pretty entertaining with its dazzling special effects and action sequences, great acting, witty dialogue, and occasional humor. Though not particulary gory, THE MUMMY does have tons of violent scenes that I think should have earned it an R rating so you might want to see it first before showing to young children. Besides the large amount of violence, THE MUMMY was one of the best movies of 1999.",Null,0,1,24 May 2001
Aquaman," A win for DC
","Aquaman always seemed like a character that wouldn't translate well to the big screen. A bit over a decade ago, HBO's 'Entourage' did a season-long storyline about the ridiculousness of the concept of an Aquaman movie. Even before that, the character had routinely been a punchline to many, even comic fans. That's why it was pretty surprising that Jason Momoa's portrayal of Arthur Curry/Aquaman in 2017's Justice League was one of the highpoints of the film. For those who enjoyed Momoa's performance in Justice League, his solo movie is more of the same, if not better.Director James Wan's greatest decision with Aquaman is in the fact the tone is kept relatively light and fun. Wan is smart enough to realize that a dark, brooding Aquaman just would never work. Wan doesn't overload his film with too many jokes, but keeps the dialogue snappy and occasionally tongue-in-cheek. Complementing the tone is great use of color to match the beautiful ocean cinematography. A lot of comic book adaptations have a very similar look to them, but Aquaman is infinitely more colorful and distinct in its color palette. The only real problem with the look of the film is that a lot of the CGI resembles a video game. This is the most common problem with blockbusters today, as even pretty good CGI is still obvious CGI, which tends to take me out of the movie a bit.Despite the overuse of CGI for the costumes, none of the actors come off as ridiculous. Jason Momoa gives a charismatic, fun performance. Amber Heard's performance has received some criticism, but I found nothing wrong with it. Dolph Lungdren makes the most of his small role, though it's weird to see Lungdren in a role where he doesn't punch anything. Patrick Wilson comes the closest to almost crossing the line between silly and foolish, though that's due more to the dialogue he's given more than anything else. Wilson still makes for an effective villain. The scenes with him and Momoa going against each other are amongst the more interesting, although the final confrontation is slightly disappointing.It's unclear at this time whether an Aquaman sequel is in the works as Warner Bros. seems unsure about what to do with their DC series right now. Despite minor problems, Aquaman is the most entertaining DC film released this decade. What could have been a disaster is an absolute blast from start to finish and James Wan's strongest film yet. Recommended to even those who don't particularly love the titular character. 7.5/10",Null,1,1,2 January 2019
Scary Movie 2," A mess, but hilarious at times
","There's no denying that Scary Movie 2 is a bit of a mess. The film, put together in less than year to make its targeted release date, is full of bad and mildly confusing editing, uneven performances, careless writing, and lazy repeat gags from the first movie. At the same time, I can't sit here and that the movie isn't hilarious at times. Just as with the first Scary Movie, the film is absolutely stuffed with non-stop jokes. There isn't twenty seconds in between where one joke ends and another begins. It's hard not to admire the commitment in that sort of comedy. Despite the fact that there are a few scenes that are painfully unfunny and forced, the number of solid, hilariously funny scenes far outweigh the terrible, laughless ones. Scary Movie 2 is about as lowbrow as one can get, but it also has the good sense to mostly spoof bad horror movies that deserve to be mocked. Even the scenes that spoof masterpieces like The Exorcist work better than they probably should. I won't defend Scary Movie 2 as a well made comedy since its rushed production schedule is obvious at every turn, though Scary Movie 2 is well worth watching for fans of the first installment. 7/10",Null,0,2,4 July 2001
Final Destination 2," One of the worst sequels ever!
","It is common knowledge that sequels are almost never as good as their originals. However, few look as bad when compared to their originals as FINAL DESTINATION 2 does. The first FINAL DESTINATION was an intelligent and well done horror flick that had an interesting premise, clever death sequences, and good performances. None of that is to be found in this sequel. This one is all about horrible acting, atrocious writing (listening to the dialog is painful to the ears), and lazy directing. *SPOILER* But my biggest beef with the flick comes with the fact that Clear is killed off towards the finale. I have often said that it is a clear indication (no pun intended) that a series is in desperate need of retooling when all or most the main characters from the original are dead. Hopefully FINAL DESTINATION 3 won't be as stale. 3/10",Null,4,8,19 January 2006
Knocked Up," Most overrated of the year
","It seems that I was one of the people in America who did not enjoy The 40 Year Old Virgin, popular comedy writer Judd Apatow's directorial film debut that launched the film careers of stars Steve Carell and Seth Rogen. There were some chuckles in it for sure, but I found it to be too long and meandering in tone. The best part of 'Virgin' was co-star Rogen who definitely upstaged Carell. With Rogen in the starring role this time around, I decided to give Knocked Up a shot.Unfortunately, the results are similar to that of 'Virgin'. Rogen is hysterical, it's the rest of the picture that's the problem. From an incredibly predictable script to questionable direction, Knocked Up is surprisingly less enjoyable than Apatow's previous effort. However, it does suffer from his debut's biggest problems: tone and length. I don't know what makes Apatow think comedies should be required to be over two hours, though he needs to become more familiar with the process of editing. Every scene goes on at least 30 seconds longer than they should. Whether a scene is relevant to the plot or not, it becomes such a point of excess that I half expected credits at the bottom of the screen to appear and say 'this is a joke, laugh now' or 'make sure you took in what this character is saying.' It doesn't help that the tone is all over the place. The switches between comedy and drama are jarring. Rogen actually handles himself quite well with the dramatic material, its love interest Katherine Heigl who isn't always convincing when she needs to be. Heigl is a good actress when given the right material, she just seems out of place here. To be fair, her character isn't very well written. Neither are the roommates in the picture. The roommates are all one-dimensional stoners that get all the best lines yet little character development. Anyone expecting well-rounded characters is advised to see something else. In fact, anyone expecting anything of actual quality is advised to see something else. Without Rogen, Knocked Up would be more painful than child birth. 2/10",Null,11,24,15 June 2007
Alien," Very good, but overrated
","Very good but overrated science fiction film stars Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, a member of an intergalatic crew invaded by an alien, hence the title. What may have seemed in cool in 1979 now seems a bit dated and at times even boring. The film tries to take its time to build up tension, which is a good thing but unfortunately it also makes the beginning seem slow, and the padded running time doesn't help matters. Unlike STAR WARS, ALIEN does not quite stand the test of time. Still, the film stands out as one of the best of the 1970s. The movie was followed by four sequels: ALIENS which was far superior, ALIEN 3 which was awful, ALIEN: RESURRECTION which was just as bad as ALIEN 3 if not worse, and ALIEN VS. PREDATOR which was just simply okay.",Null,1,2,22 May 2005
The Devil Wears Prada," Hathaway and the audience deserves better
","I'm not a chick flick guy. That may seem like an odd statement, considering they are called chick flicks for a reason, but there are some guys that actually find something to enjoy in the endless reign of female oriented films starring Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts, or the new queen of the genre, Anne Hathaway. With two Princess Diary movies under belt, Hathaway continues her foray into the world of chick film with this adaptation of the best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger. Hathaway plays Andrea 'Andy' Sachs, a wannabe journalist who gets a job working as second assistant to Runway fashion magazine's editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). Priestly is the stereotypical mean and nasty boss seen in just about every film made in the past two decades about working. However, Devil Wears Prada is too light hearted to really dive into Priestly's black heart and instead of dark humor to capture Andy's pain working for her, director David Frankel chooses to settle for lame put downs, such as insulting the way Andy dresses. Maybe there's humor to be found in that for women, but it's hard to imagine any guy finding the jokes here humorous. When jokes aren't failing left and right, the filmmakers throw montage after montage at the audience rather than focusing on character development and telling an interesting story. All this makes 'Prada' impossible rubble to sit through with no fun or wit in sight. Worse, the performances are generally annoying and/or dry. Hathaway, a great actress who has been in more bad films than any actress in recent memory, is given little to do but sound whiny and self-centered.

American Pie," A bad 'Pie'
","Any movie that's main gag is a kid doing sexual things with a pie is guaranteed to be a pretty bad 90 minutes. Not only is it bad, it is also more disturbing than funny (the pie scene that is). This movie shouldn't be as popular as it is. The plot is stupid, the characters are completely uninteresting perverts, the humor is appallingly lame, and the acting is just terrible. While I could see a version of this movie working, the overall desire to be as gross as possible without the benefit of having solid jokes or characters ruins any chance of success. I'm not against crude humor, but here the crude humor is used as an excuse for not having much else. The film simply goes from one crude comic set piece to the next without any sense of rhythm, reason, or relevance to the overall story. In the end, the whole thing just comes across as a disjointed mess. 3/10",Null,11,23,17 April 2001
North by Northwest," Good, but overrated
","NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a wonderful film. It's not as good as REAR WINDOW or PSYCHO, but it's still very well made. The directing is top notch. Hitchcock builds up tension like no other director can, except maybe for John Carpenter with some of his earliest work like HALLOWEEN. Almost as impressive as the directing in NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the editing. The film is cut almost perfectly. Editing in thrillers is key. Without proper editing, a movie is no good. Editing can make or break a film. Editing is what keeps it alive. The editing here never appears choppy. It's always clear. While the editing and directing is certainly admirable, I still feel that NORTH BY NORTHWEST is overrated. It's not Hitchcock's best. That would be PSYCHO. The problem with this one is that it has not aged as well as Hitchcock's other masterpieces. In fact, this is the one that has been hurt the most by age. It seems a bit dated and is not as suspenseful as it once was. For that, I can only give it 8/10. It's still good, just not great enough to be on the top 250 here on IMDb.",Null,1,3,31 July 2005
"I, Robot"," Besides some cool special effects and action sequences, this is nothing special!
","Despite the fact that I, ROBOT had one of the worst theatrical trailers in recent memory, I decided to see it anyway since I am a big science fiction fan. As expected, it was nothing special. There are some cool special effects and action sequences, but other than that, the movie really has nothing go for it.The main disappointment in I, ROBOT is Will Smith. Smith is normally a good actor, often quite charming and charismatic with his roles. However, Will Smith's performance here is laughable. Overacting on several occasions, Smith seems somewhat uncomfortable in the role given to him. Smith is not the only actor that comes out looking foolish. Co-star Shia LaBeouf also seems to be a wrong choice for his role and in the end, gives another weak performance. Perhaps I am being too hard on the actors. Perhaps if the screenplay was in the hands of more talented screenwriters than Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, the actors would have done a better job.Who knows how such a promising concept for a movie got this messed up? What is known is that between this and the remake of THE STEPFORD WIVES, 2004 has yet to deliver a decent sci-fi flick. 2004 has been one of the worst years for movies in a long time.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," An animated movie for everyone
","Given the success of the Saturday morning 'Spider-Man' cartoon in the 1990s and the character's ongoing popularity with kids, the fact that it took until 2018 for an animated Spider-Man feature film to get released is kind of shocking. Out of all the Marvel superheroes, Spider-Man seems like the most obvious choice for an animated film franchise. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is likely to launch that franchise, as it smartly appeals to both children who love the titular web-slinger and adults who still love the Marvel universe.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse gives fans not just one Spider-Man, but a number of them including a middle-aged Spider-Man (Jake Johnson, giving the film's greatest voice performance), a film noir Spider-Man appropriately named Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), and a pig version of Spider-Man, Spider-Ham. The inclusion of Spider-Ham is a testament to just how well the film works. Spider-Ham is a really dumb idea for a character, but one that that is perfect for both a children's picture and the sci-fi nature that 'Spider-Verse' fully embraces. What could have been an embarrassing comic relief side character instead is one of the most amusing comic book characters put onscreen in a long time.Unfortunately, before Spider-Ham and the other weirder characters are introduced, the film takes its sweet time getting going. For its target audience of young kids, it's odd that a movie with 'Spider-Verse' in the title takes a good half hour before the Spider-Verse is introduced. Around ten minutes could have easily been excised from the runtime without losing anything important. Once the Spider-Verse itself takes over the plot, there is plenty of enjoyment to be had, but the story kind of drags until that point.
Long-time fans of Spider-Man aren't likely to find much to hate about this animated version. Visually and thematically, the films is faithful to the comics that inspired it. The action sequences are just as exciting as any of those in any of the live-action motion pictures, the story is effectively told (if a bit cliched), and it sets the stage for future installments in ways that don't feel unnecessarily forced. For viewers 12 and under, this is probably a 9/10. For adults, this is a solid 7. Recommended.",Null,0,3,4 January 2019

We're the Millers," Disappointing but watchable
","In the history of 'Saturday Night Live', very few have made for strong leading men. With the exceptions of a handful of names like Chris Farley or Eddie Murphy, most SNL cast members that try to become movie stars inevitably end up failing. Jason Sudekis has unsurprisingly found himself in a number of high profile studio features the past few years. Although he certainly stole the show in films like Horrible Bosses and Hall Pass, We're the Miller is arguably Sudekis first real starring role in a studio comedy. Wisely, the screenplay largely offers Sudekis the chance to play in the two modes he does best: smarmy and charming. Playing David Clark, a small-time drug dealer who hires a group of loners to pose as his family so he can smuggle marijuana into Mexico, Sudekis is perfectly suited for the role and the first act indicates that his character is going to make We're the Millers the comedy of the year. Unfortunately, just as the film should be picking up, the script and direction slow everything down. As a road movie, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. It's simply part of the formula. But the sheer obviousness and predictability of We're the Millers ultimately kills the comedy. Maybe it's because I've seen too many comedies of this ilk, but I saw almost every big gag coming a mile away. What could have made for great character-orientated comedy becomes situation-oriented at every turn and what should come across as funny simply comes across as inevitable. Some of the over-the-top situations seem to have the potential to be hilarious, but ultimately end up being groan-worthy or disappointing in execution. To its credit, while the sight gags are fairly lame, there are enough memorable lines in the picture to keep it from being a waste of time. Whether most of the lines were scripted or improvised are anybody's guess, though this is one of the rare cases where dialogue almost completely saves a film. Every time I laughed was the result of a funny line of dialogue as opposed to something that actually happened on screen. It helps that both Emma Roberts and Will Poulter, playing the fake children, can deliver raunchy dialogue naturally without the lines sounding forced. As the fake mother, Jennifer Aniston isn't giving nearly as many good lines as she probably should have been. The potential for her character in particular seems like something that was never fully realized during the production stage. On the other hand, the role is certainly different than the others roles Aniston has played recently so at least she's able to do something else here. The rest of the cast, from Ed Helms to Luis Guzman, is generally wasted in roles that could have been cut down without any effect on the overall story. At almost two hours, the running time is about ten minutes longer than necessary for a silly comedy. At the very least, the ending is interesting enough and not a complete and total cop-out. Given the extreme success of We're the Millers at the box office, there is no doubt in my mind that a sequel will be on the way shortly. Given a bit more originality and less obvious plotting, there is the potential for a better sequel. It's possible I may grow to like We're the Millers more with another viewing. However, for now the flick stands as a disappointment given what could have been. 5/10",Null,4,6,19 December 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Solid entertainment
","Perhaps the most disappointing movie of last year was Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, a totally inept action period piece that had all the potential in the world to be an exciting B-movie style extravaganza. Instead, the film was undone by its complete inability to have an ounce of humor or fun to the proceedings. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, which looked quite similar in style to 'Vampire Hunter', plays out exactly the way that movie should have: a fun, absurd, bloody, and comical adventure that never takes itself too seriously and knows exactly the type of movie it is at all times. Director Tommy Wirkola gives Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters a very specific tone from the first scene, enabling audiences to know exactly the type of film to expect. This important tonal distinction is one that is refreshing in an era full of studio tent-poles filled with tonal inconsistencies that often come across as desperate attempts to hit every potential demographic at the same time. Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters makes no attempt to hide what is: an R-rated horror/action pic aimed at people who don't mind if things are goofy or a little dumb. It has decidedly low aspirations, but it achieves what it sets out to do: entertain for 80 minutes with plenty of fights, mayhem, and humorous nods to the original Hansel & Gretel story.The teaming of Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as Hansel & Gretel is the reason that everything works as well as it does. Despite the notable age difference between the two, there is great chemistry between them that elevates the material even when the characters aren't quite as developed as they could have been. Both Renner and Arterton deliver one-liners like pros, taking dialogue that could have been absolutely eye-rollingly bad and making them greatly amusing. It also helps that both are believable as action heroes and luckily the action sequences are devoid of the shaky cam work that is the norm for studio pictures these days. If there's a downside to the action scenes, it's that so much of the movie takes place during the nighttime that occasionally it can be hard to see in key parts, especially the finale which seems rushed. The very last scene leaves the door wide open for a sequel, which has the potential to be even crazier and more out there than this one. Even if it doesn't lead to a franchise Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is an entertaining and original stand-alone flick that is one of the better times I've had at the movies in 2013. 8/10",Null,1,3,19 August 2013
Hardball," This is NOT a comedy! [spoilers]
","Even though the trailer and commercials on television make this look like a comedy, but it isn't. There are only a few spots are funny [some of them are meant to be funny and some are funny because of Keanu Reeves' bad acting]. Though, it is not a comedy, it still is predictable. There are no surprises and nothing in this movie is even slightly moving or touching [no matter how hard the filmakers try]. For a movie about baseball there isn't a lot of baseball. All the baseball scenes are pretty brief and there is almost no description about what happened in the games or anything. In the baseball scenes, we see a couple of kids running, throwing a ball, or hitting a ball while a song plays on the sound track. I don't know what is with movies today. First, we get THE SPECIALS, a superhero movie without any action scenes and now we get a movie about baseball with baseball scenes that only last about a minute.",Null,0,0,26 September 2001

The reviews made this sound like an awful movie, but the truth is it's one of the better movies of 2002 [so far].

Batman Begins," The coolest movie of the summer!
","I've been a Batman fan essentially from the moment I was born so like most Batman fans out there, I was pretty psyched at the idea of a fifth Batman film. However, I was not so psyched to hear that the filmmakers would be starting from scratch and that BATMAN BEGINS would be a stand alone movie. I was also quite disappointed that Joel Schumacher would not be back to direct. Despite what most fans say about him, I think Schumacher did a good job with both BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN & ROBIN. When it was announced that Christopher Nolan would be the director of BATMAN BEGINS, I was not too pleased. The guy who directed INSOMNIA does Batman? It didn't sound that enticing to me and it made me a bit nervous about how the film would turn out. I became even more nervous when I saw footage from BATMAN BEGINS. None of the footage I saw of BATMAN BEGINS had impressed me. Everything I had seen from the Batmobile to the casting of Katie Holmes had just seemed so wrong. To my surprise, I liked the movie. The look of the Batmobile (as well as the Batsuit) and the casting of Katie Holmes still bugged the hell out of me, but I was able to put those two things aside most of the time and just enjoy the flick. Although it starts off a bit slow, the pace quickly picks up around the 45 minute mark and from there on out, it's quite a ride. Christian Bale makes the best Batman out of any of the actors that have played him so far. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, and Cillian Murphy are all equally impressive in their respective roles even though some of them underused. As I said before, Katie Holmes' performance is quite weak. It doesn't help that her character is completely one-dimensional. Other than the flimsy character development of Katie Holmes' character, the writing is for the most part very good. David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan wrote a nice solid script Hopefully, they will return to write the sequel if there is one. 7/10",Null,1,4,15 June 2005
Ghost Rider," A must see for comic fans
","I stated in my comment for last summer's X-Men: The Last Stand (a movie I loved the first and second viewings, and found many flaws with the third time around) that with 'Stand' and the preview for Ghost Rider that 'This could be the beginning of a long line of great Marvel pictures.' It seems that I was one of the only fans that thought so as the anticipation for Ghost Rider was lukewarm at best. Critics and moviegoers took notice of the delay from its summer release date and lambasted the unfinished special effects as well as the story. Still, I always maintained that the picture would be nothing short of great. It met my expectations. Taking cues from the underrated and brilliant John Landis, Ghost Rider mixes comedy and elements of horror perfectly, combined with over-the-top action and an occasionally unusual sound track to form a truly different and highly entertaining motion picture. Simply put, it's the best John Landis-esquire film not to be directed by Landis himself. Writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, almost always reliable in the story department (with the exception of 1998's Jack Frost), provides the audience with the right amount of character development, back-story, and exposition to keep the two hour running time from getting bloated. Directing with attention to detail, Johnson has managed to make a comic book flick seem like an art form as opposed to just a blockbuster extravaganza. However, credit must also be given to the amazing cast Johnson has put together. Nicolas Cage IS Johnny Blaze. There could have been no substitute. Eva Mendes as love interest Roxanne Simpson, is actually a character as opposed to just eye candy (although there is some of that). Wes Bentley makes for a fantastic villain. Last but not least, is Donal Logue, an actor who despite almost twenty years in the business, has yet to become the gigantic star he deserves to be. As a fan of the comics, I was not disappointed. My only nit-pick is there were times when it was painfully obvious the filmmakers were forced to stay within the limits of the PG-13 rating (I don't remember a drop of blood in the whole picture). Rest assured, this is nowhere near being the cinematic atrocities of Fantastic Four and Hulk, which are two of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is a must see for comic fans. 9/10",Null,5,10,24 February 2007
Driven," The best racing movie of all time!
","I didn't see DRIVEN when it was in the theaters for two reasons. The first was because it wasn't in theaters for very long and the second was because a lot of my friends told me that it was horrible. Despite my friends warnings and the fact that it bombed at the box office, when it came to video I rented it anyway. The movie started out a little slow, but it got better as it went along. Sure, the movie is a little long, yet if it had been shortened some of the great things about the movie would be missing. It's unusual for a movie like this to have good character development and a fairly decent plot, which is one of the reasons I recommend this. Besides the excellent racing scenes, the movie is kind of like ROCKY except it's about racing in stead of boxing. This movie is a must-see for people who think Sylvester Stallone can't act because this movie will definitely prove them wrong. Racing fans [like me] will get a kick out of the superior car chases and everyone else will just be amazed at how good a movie about race car drivers can be.",Null,1,3,17 November 2001
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Marvel's worst production yet!
","Rise of the Silver Surfer begins with a seemingly never-ending sequence that takes place in deep space. The credits roll while nothing happens. The camera looms on the computer-generated setting for what feels like ten minutes. I'm sorry to say as a Fantastic Four fan, this is one of the most exciting moments in the whole picture. For the first thirty or so seconds, I was thinking to myself that something amazing was about to happen, that this sequel would actually be cool. Then I got bored. Nothing was happening. The audience with me waited during a excruciatingly long set-up and then...nothing happens again. There were groans throughout the theater. During the next hour and half, many more groans were let out and four audience members left. By the end, I was wishing I had left too. Despite its alright box office, the team beyond Rise of the Silver Surfer has made another completely limp, uninvolving, terribly disappointing motion picture that will likely share the same legacy as the first: a total misfire.Everything that made the 2004 abomination what it was is present here. There's cringe-inducing performances by leads Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd, flat and all around boring direction, a shoddy script with elementary school dialogue and humor, and not an ounce of faithfulness to the original comics when it comes to the Silver Surfer. I don't mind if filmmakers change the comics as long as there are justified reasons (budgetary, location problems, etc), but when the changes have no aspect of creativity or intelligence, that's when I get put into a nerd-induced frenzy.Surprisingly, I have a few positive comments about the film. Micheal Chiklis, Chris Evans, and Julian McMahon all have the right looks and attitudes for their parts. Unfortunately, the script calls for dialogue and actions that make them look foolish. However, there are a few brief moments where their performances outshine the writing. There are two or three quick scenes (mostly lasting no more than thirty seconds) where the duo appeared to actually be their characters. Then came about a bad joke or awful line to destroy the mood.I'm not going to call Rise of the Silver Surfer the worst flick of the year, or even the summer. I'm sure kids will enjoy it. The kids in the theater I was in did. Nobody else was expressing enthusiasm though. Count me out for a third installment. This is definitely Marvel Comics most unwatchable production yet. 1/10",Null,11,23,16 July 2007

The gags are crude and tasteless, the comedic performances by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are great, the music is excellent, the dialogue is sharp, and throughout the entire 101 minute running time, the laughs never stop. It's part buddy road movie, part crime comedy, and part slapstick all rolled into one. Despite all these different elements, the film never feels uneven.

Carl is a goofy groundskeeper that is obsessed with killing a mischevious gopher. Some of the funniest parts in this movie are Murray's ad-libs. Unfortunately, the plotline of the caddies is overlooked by the outstanding performances by comedic stars such as Dangerfield, Murray, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight.

The Evil Dead," One of the best horror films ever made.
","The 1980s was the best decade for horror films. There was AN American WEREWOLF IN London, CHILD'S PLAY, POLTERGEIST, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and lastly there was THE EVIL DEAD. What made these horror movies so great was that they were very creative pictures that were cleverly directed and had generally impressive writing. Out of the five films mentioned above, THE EVIL DEAD is easily the most shocking and disturbing. We see a woman get raped by tress, hacked up limbs, and gore galore. Still, for those people with strong stomaches, THE EVIL DEAD is considered a classic and rightfully so. It contains all the key elements a well made horror flick should: a believable performance from the lead actor (Bruce Campbell), effective music, fantastic camera work, genuine suspense, and excellent (albeit dated) special effects. On the minor downside, the aforementioned tree rape scene goes a bit too far. Sam Raimi has said himself in interviews that he regrets the way he shot the scene and if he could go back and change it, he would. Too bad he didn't think about changing the scene earlier otherwise THE EVIL DEAD would be the perfect horror motion picture. As it is, I give it 9/10. Highly recommended for all horror fans.",Null,3,6,4 June 2005
Jurassic World," A great addition to the franchise
","From its very first frame, there is no denying that Jurassic World is an absolutely enormous movie. The Jurassic Park films have always been big-budget affairs, but the size of Jurassic World takes the series to a whole new level in terms of scope. Every single scene looks hugely expensive with massive sets, tons of extras, endless special effects shots, and lots of attention payed to even the smallest of technical detail. This easily could have been one of those sequels that falls apart from being bloated by its own excess (like almost every other big budget sequel of the past decade or so), but director Colin Trevorrow keeps the movie together. The balance of story and spectacle is kept in check. Given that this is only Trevorrow's second feature film, this is no small accomplishment. In his first foray into big-budget filmmaking, Trevorrow has crafted a picture that is way more impressive than anything put out by the major action directors in years. The movie is an absolutely breath-taking visual feast, almost (but not quite) equaling the sense of wonder present in the first Jurassic Park. Of course, all the great visuals in the world don't mean a thing if the acting isn't up to par. The Jurassic Park series has always benefited tremendously from great casting. The casting of actors like Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill made the two previous Jurassic Park sequels better than I think they get credit for, and the casting in Jurassic World makes this particular installment far more engaging than it should be. Chris Pratt is on his way to becoming a major movie star, and his performance here shows why. His natural charisma carries the film. Scenes that could have been just plodding exposition are elevated by his screen presence. It says something about an actor when he can sell an emotional relationship with CGI dinosaurs. With the wrong special effects or the wrong actor, certain scenes could have been disastrous. However, since they are effectively performed and directed, these scenes are surprisingly touching. Pratt really helps sell the man-and-nature aspect that has been prevalent in the whole series. On the human relationship side of things, Pratt has nice chemistry with Bryce Dallas Howard, and their romance is thankfully not nearly as forced as it could have been. I've read some criticism about Howard's performance, all of which seems pretty unwarranted. I think she's solid in the role, though it's true that if there's any character in the film that's underwritten, it's her character Claire. The film spends so much time on the child protagonists, which at this point is quite tiresome in the franchise, that there's not quite enough emphasis placed on making Claire the three-dimensional character she should be. One could argue Jake Johnson's character Lowery is also underwritten given the role he plays in the finale of the picture, but seeing as his primary function is being the great comic relief, it's easy to let that slide. I know some people might find Johnson's character annoying or unnecessary to the story; I personally loved the character. It's not hard to see which characters will be coming back for the next sequel as the end of the film makes it pretty obvious who the returning characters will be. Jurassic World has already become a massive success, so there's no doubt there will be a fifth installment sometime within the next few years. Jurassic World is such a a rarity--a fourth installment that is almost as good as the original--that it's possible, but unlikely, that another sequel could work. For now, the Jurassic Park series remains one of the most entertaining and exciting movie franchises of all time. 8/10",Null,6,17,21 June 2015
The Mummy Returns," 'The Mummy' is better than he was before![minor spoiler]

There are better action sequences and a better relationship between Rick and Evelyn. They are married in this one with a young boy named Alex. Alex gives the movie a few laughs, a scene of slapstick, and a sub-plot about him being kidnapped. This sub-plot makes THE MUMMY RETURNS a little longer than it needs to be or should be.

Total Recall," Most worthy of the Philip K. Dick adaptations!
","Although his name and stories have been known to genre fans worldwide for years, it hasn't been until recently that the work of Philip K. Dick has gotten the attention of Hollywood. Much of the credit has been given to Minority Report director Steven Spielberg. While Spielberg should receive a portion of the credit, the majority of it should to two others: Ridley Scott for Blade Runner, the first Dick film adaptation, and Paul Verhoeven for proving with Total Recall that Dick's ideas can translate into highly successful and highly profitable storytelling on the big screen. Reportedly going through as many as 50 drafts before shooting began, Total Recall was in pre-production for somewhere around two decades. Final writing credits go to Ronald Shusett & Dan O'Bannon and Gary Goldman, who managed to turn out the most well written the most worthy of the Philip K. Dick adaptations. Shusset and Goldman were constantly on set, according to Verhoeven on the DVD commentary, which may explain why Total Recall is one of the few Dick adaptations that doesn't suffer from the constant feeling of having too many writers aboard. Verhoeven knows how to tell a compelling and intelligent story like no other director can, which is obvious here with his complete understanding of the material. Second to Robocop, this Verhoeven's best. His direction is flawless alongside Jost Vacano amazing cinematography. Also at his best, is Arnold Schwarzenegger in his strongest performance. Sharon Stone and Ronny Cox are also memorable in their supporting roles. From every angle, this is a solid film. The only real flaw lies in the choppy MPAA required cuts evident throughout certain moments.

Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Unwatchable
","The highlight of the terribly titled Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny comes before the New Line Cinema logo even appears on screen. In a cartoon animated by John K of Ren & Stimpy fame, Jack Black and Kyle Gass fly off the force of their own flatulence. It's stupid, it's immature, and surprisingly funny. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just the first two. Once the live-action begins, the quality declines at an unstoppable rate. Jack Black and Kyle Gass, capable of being hilarious in small doses, have managed to create a motion picture so juvenile and limp that one would expect it was assembled by putting together ideas the duo came up with while in seventh grade. Their performances also are of middle school quality. Neither of them show any of the charm they have shown in previous works.

Sausage Party," Ridiculous in the best possible way
","The R-rated movie for adults is a rare treat. While Ralph Bakshi made a name for himself with a series of adult animated movies (some of which were actually rated X) in the 1970s and 1980s, very few film directors are willing to produce such crude material in an art form that is most commonly viewed as for kids only. This may be partly due to fear over what the impact such a project could have on the trajectory of one's career, but it probably has more to do with the fact that R-rated feature films don't make any money at the box office, with the exception being amazing South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. With a budget of only $19 million, the Seth Rogen produced Sausage Party may not be an expensive endeavor, though it certainly seems like it could have been a risky one for his career. Lucky for him, the results are a pretty strong success. An absolutely filthy, incredibly juvenile, and intentionally offensive romp, Sausage Party is just about as bizarre and bold as any movie released by a major studio this year. But more importantly, it's also very, very funny.Sausage Party is not a ground-breaking comedy classic like the South Park movie, but it's also unlike anything one is likely to see in the next decade. Sausage Party can be seen as a not completely subtle satire of the Disney/Pixar pictures of the past two decades, though even for someone who has never seen a Disney/Pixar film, Sausage Party is probably guaranteed to create hysterical laughter at least a few times, especially for fans of any of the cast members. Seth Rogen voices somewhat of a typical Seth Rogen character, albeit one that is a sausage. As one might expect from a Rogen picture, Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are put in as the best friends, also sausages. James Franco is Druggie, whose character name is pretty self-explanatory. Meanwhile, Kristen Wiig is Rogen's romantic interest, a hot dog bun. All of this is twice as outrageous and stupid as it sounds. However, it's also more clever than it should be most of the time, and always fun to watch, even during scenes that are rather gross and violent. Those scenes, as much as they might seem be in the film for shock value, are also highly effective. I never knew what was coming during Sausage Party and frequently found myself surprised by what would happen next, which is something I can almost never say about studio comedies.As great as Sausage Party can be, it unfortunately can't sustain itself completely for its short 89-minute running time. While never a chore to watch, the last 15-20 minutes aren't quite as good as what came before it, and the movie kind limps to its conclusion. The ending could have been a lot better, although it by no means destroys the overall enjoyment of the film. Just like most animated features these days, the end of Sausage Party hints at a sequel. Sausage Party will no doubt be successful given its small budget, though I hope there isn't a follow-up. There is no way Sausage Party 2 could feel as fresh and surprising. Sausage Party itself may not hold upon repeat viewings as so many of the jokes are based on shock value. But based on my one viewing so far, Sausage Party is ridiculous in the best possible way, and one of the most entertaining movies of the summer. 7/10",Null,17,36,13 August 2016
Wedding Crashers," The best comedy of the summer!
","The premise behind WEDDING CRASHERS is one that surprisingly has never been made into a movie before. Two guys (Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to pick up chicks. It's such a simple and fun premise, which could have quickly got old fast had it been in the hands of the wrong director or screenwriters. Luckily, director David Dobkin and screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher proved to be just the right filmmakers for the job. That's not to say that WEDDING CRASHERS is perfect. It's far from it. What starts off as a throwback to such raunchy classic R-rated comedies such as ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY'S soon becomes entangled in becoming a romance where towards the end it becomes clichéd predictable, and overly long. Still, I'm giving it a high ranking due to the chemistry of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. The duo of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in WEDDING CRASHERS is so inspired and brilliant it's amazing that no one thought of pairing them up before. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson go together like peanut butter and jelly. I would love to see them do another movie together. Hopefully WEDDING CRASHERS will be a big hit at the box office and there will be a re-teaming of the great duo. 7/10.",Null,1,4,15 July 2005
Scream 2," A pretty good sequel
","In addition to becoming the first major box office hit for Dimension Films, 1996's SCREAM also became the horror film that would set the tone for the other horror films of the late 1990s. It was a phenomenal achievement in the horror genre so of coarse a sequel was just around the corner. The most common rule with movies is that sequels are terrible and while that is normally always true, that isn't the case with SCREAM 2. It should be noted that SCREAM 2 came out just a year after the original SCREAM. Most often when sequels come out a year after their predecessor, they turn out to be pretty bad (CHILD'S PLAY 3 for example). SCREAM 2, while not as good as SCREAM, manages to be an effective and well made sequel that surprisingly is just as clever as the first one and it contains the same kind of great dialogue the first one had as well. It helps that SCREAM 2 has most of the same cast members as the first one too. I think it's safe to say that SCREAM 2 was one of the better sequels of the 1990s. I'm giving it 7/10.

Arrival," Best sci-fi movie in years

Released at the end of the year without a ton of promotion and publicity, the film has nonetheless had tremendous staying power and has continued to build its box office gross through word of mouth, becoming one of the surprise hits of the past year. While not a mega Blockbuster like Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (also a solid recommendation), the success of Arrival proves that audiences still respond to stories that aren't dependent on wall to wall action and explosions. Some may see Arrival as boring. The marketing, after all, made the film seem more action-packed than the final cut actually is. But even if the movie isn't always super fast paced, it's always at least interesting and intriguing to watch. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner give probably the best performances of their careers, giving life to characters that might not have seemed completely three-dimensional on the page. Renner and Adams share great chemistry and absolutely sell moments that could have come off cheesy or schmaltzy. The selling point of Arrival may be the alien story line, but Renner and Adams are the movie. This is really an actors' movie. However, my only one complaint about Arrival is there could have been one or two more scenes developing Renner's character and his motivations/relationship with Adams. Doing so would have been the finale slightly stronger, even it still an extremely effective ending. There are those who will be split on the ending of Arrival. Some will love it, others will absolutely hate it. I found it to be the most memorable ending of any movie of 2016. The ending begs audiences to rewatch the movie again, something I'll have no problem doing in the near future. Arrival is the best sci-fi film to come out in years. 9/10",Null,2,10,16 January 2017
Halloween," The second best horror film of all time!
","The two best horror films of all time came out in the 1970s: THE EXORCIST in 1973 and HALLOWEEN in 1978. There's no denying that both movies are absolute masterpieces. However, I have always preferred HALLOWEEN over THE EXORCIST. In terms of camera work and overall style, HALLOWEEN is the better of the two. It is masterfully directed and has very well written dialogue, a great score, and the best opening sequence of any horror film ever made. No review of HALLOWEEN would be complete without mentioning the performance by Jamie Lee Curtis. She is fantastic! She gives the best performance out of anyone in the whole movie. The supporting cast is also excellent. Donald Pleasence gives a truly memorable performance as Dr. Loomis and P.J. Soles, while annoying at times, also does a good job with her role.A brilliant motion picture that changed history, HALLOWEEN is the one film every horror fan must see. There's nothing else like it. I give it 10/10.",Null,0,4,14 August 2001
1408," An impressive summer surprise!
","The 2000s have not been a good to horror fans. While some people love torture porn such as the Saw and Hostel films, I find them to be utterly repulsive and pointless and this is coming from a guy who loves gore (when used correctly). The alternative to these snuff films is not much better. The political climate over the years has drifted to such a PC state that almost all other horror flicks have been neutered down to a PG-13 rating, cutting out all the elements fans want to see in the process. It was with that in mind that I went to see 1408, based on the Stephen King short story I'd read when it first came out though had mostly forgotten about by the time the feature went into production. My one reason for going was the fact the adaptation was co-written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, the duo responsible for writing such smart and underrated classics like Man on the Moon and People vs. Larry Flynt. It was my hope that despite the PG-13 rating, there would still be a great story. As always, Alexander and Karaszewski (along with Matt Greenberg) came through. This is the first straightforward horror picture in years to have a story and characters worth giving a hoot about. The best part of 1408 is the set-up, taking up about half an hour in the beginning to establish the lead character well played by John Cusack. Director Mikael Håfström is able to build suspense and tension with these scenes long before the frights even begin. That takes talent. Håfström makes the rest of the film visually impressive. More importantly, he is able to do so with little to no CG work. Cinematographer Benoît Delhomme has done amazing job here. Although I doubt he'll be nominated, he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for what he has accomplished. With a near perfect look and a solid story, 1408 is recommended watching for horror fans even if the PG-13 rating is a bit of a letdown. 8/10Director's Cut note: The extended director's cut contained on the two-disc DVD is a superior version with more depth and a much better ending. I give that version a 9 out of 10.",Null,1,3,16 August 2007
The Wolverine," Great until the third act
","The 2013 summer movie season has been filled with films that have relied heavily on action and relied very little on an interesting or original story. This should come as no surprise as the studio blockbuster mentality the past few years has been that movies should be loud, brainless, and should depend on action over character. Going into The Wolverine, I was expecting the film to follow this same model. To my surprise, for the first two thirds of its running time, The Wolverine is the absolute best film of the summer, a big-budget spectacle that actually pays attention to characters and tells an interesting, compelling, and intense story. Director James Mangold sets a very distinct tone from the other X-Men movies right off the bat with great opening sequences that set aside any notions that will just be another dumb action picture. Mangold takes the material seriously, allowing for a few fantastic jokes when necessary, but otherwise maintaining a strong sense of solemn atmosphere. He also knows how to direct action without resorting to choppy editing or fast motion and slow motion nonsense. Mangold perfectly mixes thematic elements involving Wolverine's depressed state in a mature and thoughtful manner with the necessary fight set-pieces. Additionally, Hugh Jackman gives his best performance yet as Wolverine. This is certainly the most dramatic of any of the installments of the X-Men series and Jackman cranks up the intensity, rage, and sadness of his character to degrees not seen before. Jackman's performance was the main reason I was convinced by the 90-minute mark this was the best X-Men production yet. But then, just as the film was reaching absolute greatness, came the last 30 minutes.While the last act of The Wolverine by no means ruins the film entirely, it does make me question what went on behind the scenes. The third act shifts the flick into dumb summer movie mode and the serious, intense tone established so well by Mangold is thrown out the window for a series of plot twists and action sequences that become increasingly more ridiculous. To make matters worse, one of the plot 'twists' is eerily similar to one that was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (it wasn't a good idea there either). The last 20 minutes really do feel like somebody made the decision that there needed to be scenes that resemble Iron Man or Transformers because, well, those made a lot of money. While the action that preceded this point is rather nicely woven into the overall plot, the action in the finale is simply there for the sake of action. Fights drag on and on, characters fall down only to get up again repeatedly, and the pace is slowed down as a result. The film eventually recovers enough to have a satisfying final scene, but by then The Wolverine as an overall motion picture feels slightly cheapened, compromised, and less satisfying.Even with the very disappointing third act, it's hard to deny that there are very powerful scenes in The Wolverine. Mangold's direction and Jackman's performance is absolutely fantastic. It seems unlikely that there will be another solo Wolverine adventure based on the U.S. box office performance of this one, though with what Mangold and Jackman accomplished The Wolverine, there has finally been a mostly solid Wolverine outing that does the character and the audience justice. This is, by far, Mangold's best effort yet and the best best of the summer. 7/10",Null,1,3,29 July 2013
Casino Royale," Don't believe the hype. The worst Bond film of all time!
","I was going to wait until a second viewing of CASINO ROYALE before writing a comment for it since my opinion on a film occasionally does change the second time around, but I am absolutely stunned at the positive rating of the picture so I feel I must get my two cents out while my grips are fresh in my mind. Since there are so many of them, the following will read more as a complaint this than a coherent review, which is appropriate since coherency is definitely not something that CASINO ROYAL has, surprising given the ridiculous two and a half hour running time. Poorly adapted by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and (groan) Paul Haggis, is the perfect example of one too many cooks in the kitchen. There are two screenplays fighting for screen time here, and the two mesh horribly. The action aspect, which I am guessing is Purvis and Wade's screenplay, is fine. The ideas behind the action scenes are incredible. The execution-not so much. Then there's the so-called character development and horrid romantic sub-plot that feel like they were tacked right after shooting began. No doubt that was the work of Haggis' trite, pain-inducing screenplay, overwrought with some of the corniest dialogue of all time delivered by the seemingly medicated Daniel Craig as James Bond. Neither charming nor slick, Craig plays Bond as if he doesn't care. There is no coolness factor to Bond here, especially when the film turns into THE NOTEBOOK in the last act. Yes, this is not the Bond we all know and love. This is a sensitive, weak, and all around boring Bond. The exact type that should not be in an action movie. To make matters worse, there is no chemistry between Craig and leading lady Eva Green. In fact, their romance seems downright creepy. Green was 25-years-old when 'ROYALE' was shot, Craig was 38 and looking over 40. I could buy them as father and daughter, but as a supposed couple, it was just a major turn off.Perhaps the biggest cinematic crime CASINO ROYALE makes is throwing the continuity of the series out the window. Granted the Bond series has never been about continuity, but what's done in 'ROYALE' is a giant slap in the face to anyone who has been following the franchise for even the past few installments. A supposed prequel to the series, the story takes place in 2006. With a budget of over $150 million, the filmmakers couldn't have set in another decade? It's just one of the many examples in CASINO ROYALE that shows film-making at its laziest. Don't believe the hype. This is the worst Bond picture of all time. I never thought I would say this, but Bond is dead. Worst of the year. 0/10",Null,129,251,17 December 2006
A Night at the Roxbury," EMILIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I have seen this movie dozens of times and it gets funnier each time and it never gets old! Although the humor is not very sophisticated, and the target audience is 12 year-old boys, it is still a very funny. Based on an old SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skit, A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY stars Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan as brothers Steve and Doug Butabi. Steve and Doug are always out 'clubbing' and partying, but they are never successful with women. Their goal in life is to get their names onto the list of the famed 'Roxbury' nightclub. Most of the movie is just Steve and Doug head-bobbing to 'What is Love?' by Haddaway. Although the plot runs very, very thin and is not backed up by a very strong supporting cast, it is a very funny movie, and is great to watch over and over.",Null,22,36,18 June 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," There's simply nothing else like it!
","I have often said that the 1980s was the best decade for horror films. There was AN American WEREWOLF IN London, CHILD'S PLAY, THE EVIL DEAD, POLTERGEIST, and of coarse A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. One of the many great movies of 1984, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is the brainchild of Wes Craven, a genius filmmaker who knows how to create suspense and fear like few directors know how to do. With 'NIGHTMARE' Craven not only proves himself as one of the world's most talented director, but he also proves he is a skillful screenwriter as well. The screenplay (which can be read on simplyscripts.com) is smart, scary, and at the time was original. It is also unlike any slasher flick one is likely to see in their lifetime. It holds up quite well today. Some parts feel a bit dated and Johnny Depp's extremely wooden performance hurts most of the scenes he's in, but the film remains in my top 5 horror movies of all time thanks to Craven's unique directing and script, the performances from Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund, and the special effects. It's a must see for horror fans. 9/10",Null,0,0,16 June 2005
300," Overrated, but still fun
","Clearly the most popular R-rated flick of 2007, 300 proved to be one of the biggest hits of the year as well as a definite career booster for stars Gerard Butler and Lena Headey and director Zack Snyder. In less than twelve months, the sword-and-sandals epic has already cemented a place in modern day pop culture. It's not very hard to see why the picture became a monster hit. For starters, it was based on a popular graphic novel from Frank Miller, a name that became mainstream once the Sin City movie proved golden at the box office a few years ago. Plus, the fact that R-rated action films (or any R-rated films) are getting harder and harder to come by definitely got a few more people into the theater. Perhaps the biggest reason the theaters filled up for 300 were the visuals. Visually, 300 is ground-breaking. It may look similar in some ways to Sin City, but this is much more fascinating and colorful to look at. Judging from a visual standpoint, 300 is practically perfect. Unfortunately, from a writing standpoint, there is a lot left to be desired. The changes made to Miller's graphic novel were unnecessary and mostly completely gratuitous. The dialog, whether intentional or not, is extremely cheesy, taking away any emotional impact from scenes that are supposed to be dramatic. While the ineptness of some of the writing makes for a fun viewing, it doesn't provide the audience with strong characters. That said, 300 isn't a complete failure. It's just not a particularly good movie, certainly not deserving of the 8.0 IMDb rating it currently holds, especially with all the unintentional comedy ('This is Sparta' always get a huge laugh in addition to cheers. 5/10",Null,0,1,31 December 2007
The Nice Guys," Instant classic!
","If I had to pick my favorite screenwriter of all time, I would probably have to pick Shane Black. Despite not being nearly as prolific as he once was, every time a new Shane Black penned film rolls around, it's always a treat. The trailer for The Nice Guys made me hopeful that the film would be the kind of comedic action flick that used to be made in the 1980s and 1990s, one where the plot actually mattered. As it turns out, while the very action-heavy trailer for the film is somewhat misleading, The Nice Guys is still not only a great surprise, but also my favorite movie of the past decade.Those expecting non-stop gunfire and constant jokes may be disappointed by the fact that The Nice Guys is, first and foremost, a period piece mystery. Set in 1977, the story follows hard-drinking private detective Holland March (Ryan Gosling) and hard enforcer Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe in his most entertaining performance ever) as they try to find Amelia Kutner, a missing young woman who may be in way over her head. This may sound like a plot that would be full of clichÃ©s, predictable story beats, and characters that have been seen over and over again. While it's true that The Nice Guys does lean on a few staples of the genre, it's also consistently surprising, completely fascinating, and even unexpectedly touching in a few places. This being a Shane Black film, there's still plenty of hilarious lines and comedic elements, but it's a bit less jokey and quip-filled than a lot of his previous work. The story and the characters come first here. When the occasional action scene does happen, it feels purposeful rather than just thrown in to be cool or keep the audiences' attention. Black's direction in these scenes is better than ever, as the shoot-out that concludes the film is the most entertaining action scene I've seen in at least five years.The biggest surprise for me is how great Crowe and Gosling are together. I've never loved or hated either one of them, as I've always been kind of indifferent to their respective careers. But here, Gosling and Crowe are absolutely perfect in their roles. Funny, sad, mysterious, and cool at times, both their characters are ones that are great to spend the entire screen time with, even when they aren't necessarily, as the title puts it, nice guys. They are insanely well written, damaged, and completely compelling characters throughout every scene. In supporting roles, Kim Basinger, Matt Bomer, and newcomer Angourie Rice shine in parts that could have been stock characters. Every person in this movies so amazingly good that it's hard to pick a favorite.If there's one flaw in The Nice Guys, it's that the very end, while totally in line with the type of story being told, is a minor letdown. The ending is an appropriate one for the film, but it could have used a bit of punching up. The ending leaves things open for a sequel, one which will never happen due to the low opening weekend numbers. There's no movie I would rather see than The Nice Guys 2. The characters lend themselves to the possibility of a great franchise.I can't overstate what a blast The Nice Guys is to me as a movie fan. I won't go as far as to call it flawless, but it is as close to perfect of a film as I'm likely to see the rest of 2016. I loved almost every second of it, and would gladly sit through a longer cut in a heartbeat. The Nice Guys is an instant classic, one that I will definitely be watching over and over again. Highly recommended. 9/10",Null,5,11,23 May 2016
The Wedding Singer," A great romantic comedy, a stand-out in its genre
","I've never been a fan of romantic comedies. There's a very small number of them that are both romantic and funny. I can count the number of memorable romantic comedies on one hand. On that hand is THE WEDDING SINGER, one of the biggest surprise hits of the late 1990s. Released just before Valentine's Day in 1998, the film went on to gross over $120 million worldwide. Generally box office successes are short lasting ones. A picture may make money, but few are remembered by many after the year of their release. THE WEDDING SINGER has continued to be remembered and love eight years after its theatrical release. It is a constant fixture on VH1, and its popularity as only increased with the Broadway musical version released earlier this year. Both the movie and the play are better than they have any right to be with all the clichés, though the movie is definitely better. What the play can't top is the almost perfect cast. Adam Sandler gives the best performance of his career as Robbie Hart, the title wedding singer who has his heart broken after his fiancé (Angela Featherstone) stands him up and dumps him on their wedding day. Drew Barrymore, playing waitress Julia Sullivan, has undeniable chemistry with Sandler, even if her delivery is off at times. Matthew Glave is perfect as Barrymore's sleazy fiancé. The real standout for me, however, has always been Allen Covert as Sandler's friend Sammy. Covert is able to bring sympathy to a character that initially is a loser with a very believable performances. Of all talented actors and actresses on screen, only Christine Taylor isn't give enough time to be seen as a fully developed character. While this doesn't really damage the film, it is a noticeable flaw.All things considered, THE WEDDING SINGER isn't high art, though it remains a genre favorite among both men and women, which is saying something. Highlights include the spectacular finale, Sandler's rendition of 'Love Stinks', and the great appearances by Sandler buddies Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nealon, Robert Smigel, Peter Dante, Steven Brill, screenwriter Tim Herlihy, and Steve Buscemi. Fans of 80s music must pick up the amazing sound track featuring Idol, Lionel Richie, Hall & Oates, Culture Club, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, Madonna, and J. Geils Band, among others. Highly recommended, romantic comedy fan or not. 9/10",Null,0,2,18 December 2006
