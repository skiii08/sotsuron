Requiem for a Dream," A MUST see for those who are big in films
","My first Darren Aronofsky film was Pie and immediately i was hooked with this guy.  He is an amazing film director and for those of you who don't know he is going to direct Batman year one.  Requiem is an incredible movie and Darren's cinematography in this film makes it one of the all time greats.  If you like quality movies that aren't just spending millions to make millions, you wanna see this movie.  For those who can connect with this film, I'm pretty sure you wont want to be by the end of it.  This is one of the most impressive uses of camera shots i have ever seen.  If you are a film major i wont be surprised if your professor shows you this film as an example of achievement.  Just watch the movie and you will understand.",9,0,1,23 February 2002
