The Lobster," A Creative Stepping Stone for a Brilliant Director
","Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster opens spectacularly, inviting your imagination to explore the grand dystopian future it presents. It proceeds to dole out sharp commentary on society's pressure to find and maintain a relationship at any cost, even by introducing a child to the dysfunction. However, all this goes to waste as The Lobster overstays its welcome. Without much more to say, the film drags along, promising a grand revelation in its finale. Alas, the final scene was telegraphed long ago to anyone paying attention, and lingers in the air like rotting shellfish.",6,1,4,2 August 2019
Knives Out," Time to Go Dust off Your Detective Caps
","Knives Out is a great time through and through. Rian Johnson expertly weaves his mysterious threads to create another fantastic addition to the whodunit genre. The cast joyfully embrace their roles, radiating a playful energy throughout the entire film. Just enough structural changes are made to the classic formula to make Knives Out feel fresh and new. A few flat jokes and one minor limp reveal cannot ruin what is otherwise one of 2019's most enjoyable films.",8,2,8,1 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Concluding the Skywalker Saga at Lightspeed
","Director J.J. Abrams attempts to use The Rise of Skywalker as both a conclusion to the Skywalker Saga and as an apology for The Last Jedi. In doing so, Abrams forces the film to rush through much of its runtime and story, simply due to the bloat. If you are on board for the story and in-universe changes then the last third of the film still has something to offer. A few spectacular moments and nostalgia hits make the climax an enjoyable sendoff for the saga, but the pacing and patchwork nature of much of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth.",6,1,2,30 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Quentin Tarantino's Longing for Times Past
","Quentin Tarantino depicts 60's Hollywood in a way only he could. All of the staples of his filmmaking appear, but in a much more restrained fashion. The vast majority of the film lacks the grandiose swagger of his more recent films, but it successfully draws you into the atmosphere all the same. What some may view as bloated actually plays an essential role. Without letting the audience simmer in the magic of Tinseltown, Tarantino's signature explosive finale would lose its thematic punch. You may not get as much out of repeat viewings of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood compared to the rest of Tarantino's filmography, but the first time is exceptional enough.",9,21,40,26 July 2019
The Lion King," Chasing Visual Perfection, but at What Cost?
","The Lion King (2019) perfectly encapsulates Disney's new wave of soulless remakes. A one-to-one retelling of the same story cannot escape comparisons to the original, and when the original outperforms the newer model in every way, what is the point? Abysmal voice-over performances, characters lacking any form of defining traits or emotion, and musical showpieces that forget to show anything plague the film. No reality exists where someone chooses to watch The Lion King (2019) over the 1994 classic after this release window closes.",3,25,39,19 July 2019
1917," Failing to Live up to the Expectations Set by Its Own Efforts
","Sam Mendes' 1917 delivers some truly awe-inspiring set pieces with the aid of its one-shot effect, but fails to take advantage of it when trying to bring stress levels back down to Earth for its quieter scenes. Not only does it not take full advantage of it, but at times the one-shot becomes truly distracting and out of place due to wonky camera work. 1917's spikes of gorgeous tension make it a must-see film, just one that does not live up to its potential.",7,0,2,25 January 2020
A Clockwork Orange," A Real Horrorshow
","Stanley Kubrick's controversial masterpiece stands the test of time. Diving deep into themes of rehabilitation, incarceration, morality, and the corruption of society, A Clockwork Orange forces the audience to come to their own conclusions. Kubrick sets the stage for self reflection through expert cinematography and a number of brilliant performances. The film presents a complex question surrounded by many possible conclusions, and refuses to spoon-feed the audience. Like the hands on a clock, not much progress has been made by the time the story is over, but that is entirely the point.",10,0,0,22 July 2019
Parasite," The Best Film of 2019
","Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019.",10,16,25,6 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," It's Definitely Not a Good Time to Be a Nazi
","Jojo Rabbit's wit and heartwarming message come together to form a fantastic film. Taika Waititi, while playing (an imaginary and flamboyant) Adolf Hitler, uses Jojo Rabbit to look at the indoctrination of the emotionally vulnerable and what can be done to save them. Encapsulating this message are legitimately hilarious moments, deconstructions, and political satire. With such a sensitive subject matter, any attempt at comedy needs to have a point and needs to actually be funny; Jojo Rabbit sticks the landing.",8,0,0,24 February 2020
