","James Mangold has directed two of my favorite movies: Logan and 3:10 to Yuma and it's safe to say, he has done a tremendous job with this one!
It's a straightforward drama but at times, to my surprise, the movie is downright hilarious! There are two scenes where I couldn't stop laughing. Those low angle wide shots will give you eyegasm.
Bale and Damon's tempestuous friendship on screen is the real highlight of the movie made believable by their wonderful performances. Movie drags out for a while in the middle but it picks up as fast as a race car coming out of a pit lane. Bale's Brit slags are on point! Even if you don't know or care about cars I guarantee you'll enjoy this one.",8,0,1,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This is the end of Skywalker saga even if it is not a fitting one.
","After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I had little to no hope from The Rise of Skywalker. Still I became a little optimistic knowing JJ was going to direct it. It is very clear that Disney had no idea from the get go that what they are actually going for. JJ and Rian both had different visions and it shows.
There are so many WTF questions in this movie that I stopped thinking about 'how and why this just happened' in the middle.
To correct the mistakes that the last Jedi made, JJ have made some questionable choices and very few of them have paid off.
The plot holes in this movie are so big that you could fit an entire star killer base through them. How can a master planer like Palpatine, who is plotting for 70 years suddenly does things off the cuff. There are so many things that don't make sense. There are some editing mistakes too.
Now to the good stuff:
Adam Driver's Kylo Ren really shines in this movie. He has given a brilliant performance. Even though Carrie Fisher is dead, they have done a good job showing her on screen using previously unused footage. Cinematography is spectacular, as expected form JJ backed by equally spectacular John Williams score. Some of the lightsaber battles and force 'miracles' look so freaking awesome that I unknowingly let out a loud cheer. Speaking of new force powers, I would recommend you watch 7th episode of The Mandalorian to get a better sense of it all. There are so many scenes and callbacks and easter eggs deliberately added just for fanservice and it works. Lets just say everything from canon can be found if you look closely enough. I really liked that.
This is the end of Skywalker saga even if it is not a fitting one.",7,0,2,22 December 2019
