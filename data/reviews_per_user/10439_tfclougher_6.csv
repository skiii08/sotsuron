Despicable Me 2," Follow-up invites high expectations
","I thought the shift from domestic to adventure was a stretch. But I enjoyed the voices/characters. I thought it seemed less than the original. But I went along for the ride. I gave it seven but it is easily an eight. It was a work of love, obviously, and it showed. I had a bit of a cold which added to my attitude of stepping back to see what appealed to my six-year old granddaughter. There was a plot to carry you along with the romance that Gru felt compelled to resist. The children were laughing and so were the adults. Good fun for the whole family. Can there be a DM3? Sure. You cannot say that you will never see a dark day again in your life. There is always another call for Gru's skill set.",7,0,0,8 August 2013
Glory," The youth and class of Colonel Shaw
","I did research on Robert Gould Shaw. His greatgrandfather formed Gouldsboro, Maine, with Robert Gould and one other. Mr. Shaw was a merchant in Boston. Two of his sons settled in Maine, dying in their forties. One was the grandfather of Robert Gould Shaw. His family moved to Staten Island and Robert at age 12 did a miserable stint at St. John's College, West Hills Farms, Westchester, the future Fordham University, The Bronx, New York. After one year there, he travelled with his family through Europe, being taught by tutors. In 1856, he entered Harvard University, graduating in 1860. The family still lived on Staten Island, NY, and the censuses for 1840, 1850 and 1860, show several servants.The South saw hypocrisy in the North. Immigrant labor was exploited for cheap labor and unions were suppressed. The term 'wage slavery' was applied by slave owners to this Northern aberration. The household servants were certainly well-treated and cherished. But their Irish, German and Polish relatives lived in slums and exploded in 1863 in the Draft Riots. Their people were fighting for the black man whom they saw as competitors for their jobs. This competition was used by the upper classes to maintain their profits. It was their homes that were ransacked during the Riots. It was New York militia men who put down the rioters after returning from Gettysburg. Irish killing Irish.The war was a fight for freedom. The fight continued after for everybody.Blacks and poor whites were held back in the South, and Labor in the North was seen as a threat. The fight goes on even today with different immigrants. But instead of cheap labor coming here, companies find it in the Third World.Unmentioned is Andre Braugher who played the bookish intellectual soldier whom Denzel Washington picked on. The moderate, thinking brains of the future offset by the impulsive, reactive orator goading people to action. Two sides of a movement. John Finn was the Irish drill sergeant who called the troops 'ye bloody Hindoos'. Shaw wanted discipline and pride in the ranks, and his sergeants hammered it into them.",10,1,2,28 January 2011
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Universal Frenzy
","This was a bit of a shell game, quick changes, shifting focus, frenzied light show on top of scientific jargon to draw us into believing that something was accomplished. 'Timeless' had the same conceit: go to the past to change it so that your wife and child would return. But history was present to provoke thought and I-didn't-know-that moments. I felt sorry for the gangster who produced the fantastic machine: he loved his wife and child. Sometimes death is death. The saving grace is that we miss the dead and remember them. as in Coco. Also a fantastic animation. So, on that basis, the cartoon worked. Marvel is over the top. I loved Peter Parker as paunchy. His wife missed him because he dove into his rescue work. A death of a marriage, each rescue escapade was another nail in the coffin. The visual jokes were good. The 'heart' was there. Stan Lee was there as usual. We miss him, but his 'heart' lives on. A bit much for the preschoolers. Cool for the older ones. Narrative lacking cohesiveness for the retired. Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' confused me at the time. I suppose I was supposed to 'get it' but the visuals for his entry into whatever he was entering were cheesy. But, like this Spider-Man, some visuals just danced, like the Blue Danube playing while the ships docked. Swinging through a forest? Superb.",5,9,44,16 December 2018
Coco," Pagan stereotypes
","Some feel that COCO honors pagan holdovers. The 'genius' of Christianity of the Roman Catholic sort was to adapt what people had to teach a lesson. Look at the Chinese. Missionaries, Catholic and Protestant, saw ancestor worship as idolatry. Now they say it is merely remembering the past, learning the good from it and letting go of the failures. Christmas came from the Saturnalia. During that time, Romans were ordered to be cheerful and generous. On one of the days, servants and masters reversed roles, getting back to the golden age when men were one and in community. Besides who lets anyone freze or starve during the deadliest, darkest time of year. All Saints Day took over Samhain, the Druidic first day of winter when the boundaries between the worlds went down. Saints have always been those who are 'with God', doing good, being human beings, mensches. Some are declared to be with God and 'worthy of imitation'. The idea of the soul is a pagan construct. The Hebrews believed that you did not worship God from the grave. But God is abstract, no dimension or measurement, Being itself, not a being among other beings. God is present where there is Truth, Justice, Charity. And the dead are still 'with God' if they were with God in life. They are with God in memory. As the elder Muslim said in a Town Called Alice, 'Who cares for women and children has God not far from him,' when asked to help wandering mothers and their children in Japanese-occupied Malayia in 1942. All Saint and All Souls teach that: remember the good that your family did and follow it. They loved you. Love others. It is an ordinary concept for ordinary people. It is not some ritual performed at a High Mass in the Cathedral for the rich hacienda owners or the capitalist elite. It is Francis of Assisi, pedestrian, barefoot, not a priest, not in the hierarchy, looking for the man or woman who needs help or a helping hand, who works alongside the men and women in the fields or the factories, who dresses in overalls. So there. COCO has that kind of heart.",10,1,7,30 November 2017
Wonder Woman," WW and WWI
","There might be a spoiler here I give ten out of ten to anything that 'holds together' meaning 'has integrity'. This movie had something to say and said it. Wonder Woman was the creation of Professor Marston, a feminist. There is a whole book about it, him and his creation.World War I (The Great War, The War to End All Wars, what irony) was only the first act of a twenty-year truce. The Treaty of Versailles and related treaties set up all the problems that we face now. Think of France and Great Britain dividing up the Middle East with no regard to ethnic and religious interpretation boundaries. Bad choices were made. And choice is a matter of love, which is what Wonder Woman is about, which is neither male nor female. That and kick-ass fighting skills. Both require being attentive. Humans are flawed but are known by their choices. In Existentialist terms, 'Man is known by his projects.' Think of the Flood. Mankind had become so bad that the gods (the Flood story comes from the Gilgamesh and is in Genesis) wanted to destroy it. But He, They, won't do it again. According to Jared Diamond, societies 'choose' to fail or succeed. Some people choose to blame God, Allah, the gods, the devil, whatever. Events overwhelm them rather than what they think of events. This movie has that philosophical vibe without losing the tension. That's enough. Well done. WWI has always held a fascination for me. My Irish immigrant uncles left Great Britain only to end end up fighting to save them from their bad choices.",10,3,12,6 June 2017
The Martian," Smarts
","Brendan the Navigator once prayed, 'Oh, Lord, your ocean is so big and my boat is so small.' That 'fear' and awe did not stop him from sailing across the Atlantic in his 'curragh' (Gaelic word, like a kayak)covered in pitch and balanced for buoyancy. He did not presume on some outside agency to do it for him, but went with the flow and paid attention to realities. Matt Damon's character did that as did Sandra Bullock's in Gravity. The people in Interstellar were more 'what if' and changed the outcome by changing the input. Listen to those voices in your head and do the math and get to work. Pay attention to what is, avoid wishful thinking, be in the moment. Who said it, 'Solve one problem at a time. Then move on to the next'? This movie was one at a time each with it's anxiety that maybe it wouldn't work. Sometimes it didn't. Back to the old drawing board.",10,2,6,10 October 2015
