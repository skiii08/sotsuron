10 Cloverfield Lane," Psychological Sci-Fi Suspense Drama
","At first glance, I probably would not have taken the time to watch this movie; I am not the type that cares what actresses/actors are in a movie, and the title was somewhat deceptive...since anyone who has seen the movie Cloverfield and didn't really care for the nauseating video camera effects, might think that it is related to that movie.
I watched the trailer and it still didn't produce any wow factor, but I decided to watch it anyway. At first the movie starts a little on the slow side and but it quickly gets interesting. Character development is lacking, but what information is given; actually is the perfect amount for this type of movie.
I think one of the best ways to describe the movie, with giving too much information; is that if you liked the movie 'Misery', you will enjoy this movie...there are several similarities between the two movies. Main character held against their will, what appears at first to be a psychotic captor - who in reality is extremely intelligent, suspense from not knowing what will happen next; overall I definitely think that it worth watching.",9,0,0,4 November 2018
Bird Box," Disappointing from such a great cast
","I am honestly not sure what, if anything; people would possibly find interesting about this movie. This movie was as bad as the horror/thriller movie, in which people were getting killed by their cellphones; that was made fun of in several spoofs like Scary Movie. Character development is absent. The kids are called boy and girl, partially mimicking the director of Mother! Their is no explanation as to why the birds even matter. It is almost a replica of the movie The Happening, except with blindfolds on. The 'transmission' of the psychotic episodes is unrealistic. The wind is the cheap thriller to let you know that something is supposedly near the people. Just all around a terrible movie.",1,9,14,7 January 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Why couldn't they just let Jeff Goldblum get eaten in first movie.
","The movie was quiet frankly disappointing out of the entire franchise. The acting was terrible. Jeff Goldblum was annoying in the first movie and just continued to bore in second movie. With the Independence Day: Resurgence being a mega flop; one would expect that Jeff Goldblum would not be casted in any of the Jurassic World sequels, but unfortunately it looks like he is going to be in Jurassic World 2. Just my opinion, but both films had and have potential; but they really need to focus on keeping the top talent around. Additionally keep us surprised at what may happen and introduce the latest technologies, and ones that are in progress; one of the captivating things about the original Jurassic Park, was the technology that was displayed...that was just barely starting to be used and tested in the real world.",5,110,185,1 April 2018
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A great representation of one of England's most powerful queens.
","Unlike most movies and television series that tend to focus on palace intrigue, more than history and turbulent times for the monarchy; Elizabeth: The Golden Ages takes us back to a time in which the England and the monarchy were genuinely in threat of being taken over. Cate Blanchett does an amazing job playing Queen Elizabeth, showing her vulnerability and self-doubt in more private situations; but showing her strength and perseverance as a true leader in public. Overall, an amazing film to watch.",10,0,0,1 December 2018
