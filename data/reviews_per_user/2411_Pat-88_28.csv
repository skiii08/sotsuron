The Blair Witch Project," The Best Movie Of 1999
","This is without the doubt the best movie of 1999, there's not much great movies came out this year. And this is only one that did. This is also the best horror movie I've ever seen too.You don't need to add a lot of blood and gore to make a great scary flick. This movie was so real. The noise is so creepy.****",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty good
","Not as good as the old Star Wars films, but still a great movie to watch. I didn't think that Jar Jar is that annoying and not racist. I didn't have a problem with him. Lucas put him in the movie for little children to enjoy.The special effects were good too. I didn't understand some of the plot pretty much. I understood some of it. This movie is still pretty good, if you want to have a great time.***1/2",Null,0,1,26 June 1999
Wayne's World," THE BEST TEEN MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!
","This movie rocks!!!! Its better than every teen movie ever made. And the funniest. Mike Myers is the king of comedy! He didn't make a bad movie since except that god-awful 54 movie. Rent this movie today, you'll laugh at this film so hard. Much better than both of the Austin Powers films.
****",Null,0,2,1 August 1999
Kickboxer," The Same Ol' Crap
","What a big rip off of 'Bloodsport'; This movie confused me with Bloodsport. This movie should have been called 'Bloodsport 4: The return of Jean-Claude Van Damme' because the movie have the same actor and plot as Bloodsport.It's the same thing; Van Damme fighting with other people in the ring is pretty much the same thing as 'Kickboxer.'This is not Van Damme's worst movies (Knock Out was), but not a very good one. The acting is weak. This movie is still worth the rental, but if you seen Bloodsport. This movie will fell short. ** out of ****",Null,1,4,21 April 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Funny but true!
",The funniest movie ever made. Some people didn't like this film because it cuss so many times. Guess what... that's what the movie is all about. cussing and r-rated movies. This movie blows me away and it much better than the television show. And a lot funnier too. ****,Null,0,0,29 August 1999
Blade," Pretty cool
",Blade is an much better vampire slayer than Buffy. This film got amazing special effects. They're so cool!This movie may have a lot of blood. But its very entertaining. Blade is the best movie which based on a comic book yet. I'll recommended this movie to anyone who love to collect comic books.***,Null,0,1,30 July 1999
The Mummy," One time is enough
","This movie was great to watch only once, if you watched it again you will get bored of it the second viewing.This film does have some great special effects, but not something that I've never seen before. There wasn't a lot of action in this movie to make me want to view this movie again.The Mummy isn't a bad movie, but an okay one. I heard some rumors there will be an Director's Cut version. I hope that will be better, if there is one.**1/2",Null,0,0,26 June 1999
Home Alone," Painfully Unfunny
","Funny Movie Ever Made? Yeah, if you think breaking every bone in your body is a laughing riot. Everything about this movie and it sequels is not funny. Only people keep on getting hurt by wired booty traps which isn't a funny thing, if it did happen to you. I only recommend this movie to anyone who think falling down is funny.*",Null,1,3,6 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Ed Wood Look Out!
","This is the most god awful unfunny piece of crap I've ever laid my eyes upon. This trash doesn't even deserve to be called 'Shakespeare'. If Williams Shakespeare saw this movie, he would have sued the director of this film. The movie didn't have any jokes that made me want to laugh, instead it bored me to death.I don't know why some people loved this trashy movie. If you people want a real comedy, watched 'Austin Power: The Spy Who Shagged Me'. This film is much worse than any Ed Wood movie ever produced.No Stars",Null,0,0,27 June 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Boring
","Varsity Blues, Carrie 2 The Rage, Never Been Kissed, Can't Hardly Wait, Idle Hands, Dead Man On Campus, She's all that and 10 Things I Hate About You. What all those films have in common? They're all the same old boring Teen flick with the same things when kids get drunk and fall in love with each other. Then go to an high school prom.Election, that's an teen movie for you. An adult falling in love with a teenage girl is something that didn't happen in a teen movie before.Movies like 10 Things I Hate About You doesn't do much instead having some teenage actors that do the same dumb things that other teen flicks already done before is pretty dull. It gets old after awhile. Don't you think? Isn't it time to make an movie about something else than dumb teenage kids doing the same things over and over again.What about an movie about some teenage kids go to some strange fantasy world. And have to battle huge monsters and demons. That's better than some boring kids doing nothing at all except going to some dumb dance/or prom and getting drunk.I want something else. PLEASE!!!!No Stars",Null,0,0,24 June 1999
American Pie," It's okay
","This movie was okay, but a little bit too over-rated. Almost all of the funniest scenes been shown on the commericals on T.V.  It ruins most of the movie for me. The movie's still funny, but not as much as the people say it is.**1/2",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
American Pie," Too Over-Rating
","American Pie is funny, but this movie was way too over rating. Critics treat this movie like it was funny as There's Something About Mary. This movie wasn't that funny.They show so much on the tv commericals which ruined most of the movie for me. Don't believe the hype, this movie wasn't as funny as the people said it is. Its not a bad movie overall, but not a good one.**",Null,0,0,30 July 1999
BASEketball," BASEketball sucks!
","No wonder Trey Parker & Matt Stone didn't liked their own movie BASEketball. This movie was terrible. All this movie is about two morons who creation their own sport game. The only problem  is... there's wasn't a single part in the movie, I didn't even smile at.The thing that I don't understand is, Trey & Matt keep on getting into the other team's faces to try to make them miss their shot. Huh? Isn't that cheating? Thats an outrage and unfunny. I won't recommend this movie to anyone, you'll have better luck with Trey & Matt's other film 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut' this movie is just trash. The nude scene of Trey Parker & Matt Stone make me wanna puke too.1/2*",Null,4,10,3 August 1999
Independence Day," Yawn
","Why did Fox remove The Simpsons  this sunday because of this crappy movie? What a waste of time; There's less aliens in this film. The movie got mostly talking than aliens.There only a couple of scenes that showed you the aliens, they mostly ride in their little dumb space ships.A spaceship covered almost the entire sky, ohh please. You people, can do better than that!The title of this film should have been called 'Dumb Day'I'd rather have watched The Simpsons and Family Guy than this.1/2*",Null,0,1,20 May 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," This movie is not bad
","Why everyone hated this film? This is a fun movie to watch.First of all, Movies like Godzilla (1997) and Sergeant York (1941) are the ones that are bad movies, Not The Lost World: Jurassic Park. I have to admit that the story is kinda weak, but at least you can understand it unlike some movies.I liked this movie the same as much as I liked Jurassic Park, Believe me there are way much worse sequels out there like Batman & Robin and Superman IV.I will give this movie **** out of **** (The first movie gets the same rating)",Null,0,0,19 March 1999
The Evil Dead," Not good
","This movie isn't the worst film, but it is bad compared to Evil Dead 2. I didn't enjoy this movie as much as that movie. Even Army Of Darkness is much better than this movie. This movie doesn't have the humor that the other Evil Dead movies  have, which make this movie the worst of the series.There still some nice scenes in the movie, but not enough to recommend this movie to the fans who loved the sequels. You will be much happier with Evil Dead II.** By the way, check out my reviews for 'Evil Dead II' and 'Army Of Darkness'.",Null,0,1,27 June 1999
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," STILL, painfully unfunny as the first movie was
","Yes, Kevin's quest continues again with the same old dumb booty traps. Yep... such like the first dumb Home Alone movie. People keep on getting hurt by some more booty traps, which isn't a funny thing. If you think getting hurt is funny. Things keep on getting much worse on Home Alone 3....*",Null,0,1,6 August 1999
Castle in the Sky," James Van Der Beek's best
",Forget that godawful Varsity Blues movie-- James Van Der Beek's acting is 1000 times better than that movie including Anna Paquin's. This is simply the best film I've ever seen. If you're a fan of Japanese Animation. This is a film for you. It rocks!***1/2,Null,3,4,16 July 1999
The Godfather: Part III," The Worst Of The Godfather movies, but not as nearly as everyone says it is.
","This film is pretty good, if you don't compare this movie with the last two movies. Okay, the plot in this Godfather movie isn't great. But some of the acting is. Come on people! Give this movie a chance.***",Null,1,2,20 July 1999
Hercules," Disney can do a much better job than this
","One of the worst Disney animation movies ever; the animation is horrible. Disney can do much better than that.The music wasn't really good too. This movie is great for small children to watch, not for teens and adults.**",Null,1,2,25 June 1999
Scream 2," Scream 2 (1997)
","This was a good teen horror flick, better than most teen horror films out there. This movie have a original plot and the acting is great. Scream 2 is much entertaining than the first movie because there more blood/and gore, but that doesn't make the film great. I give this movie ***1/2",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
Halloween," True Horror Classic
","This is one of the best Halloween movies. Watch the first movie and the 2nd movie, skip all the other sequels. There's some great killing in this movie. Much better than both of the Scream movies (I liked those too, but not as much as this one). Go out and rent this movie and Halloween 2 Right NOW!!!!!!!Please don't rent Halloween 3 to H20 because they SUCKED!!!!!****",Null,0,0,16 May 1999
Paths of Glory," it was a good movie, but it wasn't Stanley Kubrick's best
","This was a good movie, it sure blows that god-awful Sergeant York movie away. Its not one of Stanley Kubrick's best movie. He'd made much better movies than this one before of course.I give this movie, ***1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," Night at the Suckbury
","This movie almost received the award for worst comedy of the millennium. But luckily for them, Chairman of the Board been released. Again, there wasn't a single funny moment in the entire picture. You can't even crack a smile, yet again there was some funny scenes at the beginning of the movie. But it will repeat them again and again later in the film which make you fall asleep so fast.                            1/2*",Null,0,5,21 August 1999
Back to the Future," Not as good as Part II. But still a good movie
","This movie was cool, great special effects for a 80's film. But this film was a little bit too over rated, don't you think? It's not one of the best movies I've ever seen.This movie is still pretty good. I thinked that Part II is much better.***",Null,1,3,26 June 1999
The Birds," One of the best horror movies of all-time
","Don't listen to all the bad comments about this movie, they don't know what they're talking about. This was a good movie, It's much better than The Birds 2 which is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen.***1/2",Null,3,5,24 June 1999
Evil Dead II," What a movie!
","Evil Dead II is much better than the first movie, I really didn't like the first Evil Dead movie much. Evil Dead II is one of the best horror movies that I've seen.This movie is a must-see, if you are an big horror fan. This film was pretty weird too.***1/2",10,0,1,23 June 1999
Evil Dead II," LOL!!!!!
",This movie rocks!!!!!! THIS IS THE BEST HORROR MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Forget all those teen horror movies of the 90's like 'Scream 2' and 'I still know what you did last summer'. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE. This film is da bomb. I don't care if this film didn't have a plot. All I care about how is funny the movie is.Rated:A+,10,0,1,1 January 1999
