The Blair Witch Project," Amateur theatrics with real sense of horror looming in the distance.
","A terrific sense of horror looms over this amateur production.  I loved the design elements, from the series of twig bundles to the abandoned 'cabin' at the end with the bloodied hand prints on the walls.  However, the amateur level of theatrics and ad-libbing take a major leap of imagination to overcome.  Michael Williams comes off best in the least showy role, with Heather Donohue and Joshua Leonard coming across as sophomore college drama students left too long to their own devices.  I understand it would be very difficult to develop any sense of plot and script when you leave it to the improvisational skills of untried talent, but perhaps a real script with improv touches would have resulted in a truly interesting horror flick. Also the conceit of having Heather NEVER give up her camera really breaks the believability in moments when no person would realistically keep filming.",1,1,4,9 July 1999
Cast Away," Overblown, bloated, with a completely insulting ending!
","SPOILER ALERT!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!This is the kind of moviemaking that makes you sad to be alive.  Somewhere hidden inside this overblown Hollywood 'DRAMA' is a lovely little film begging to be let go.Zemeckis once again proves that he was at one point a minor director with major assets, and now he is a major director with rapidly diminishing assets.  The special effects are wonderful, the photography is good, but the cast reaches soooo desperately for dramatic intensity, it practically makes you cry.Helen Hunt has captured the crown of 'Queen of Unwarranted Pauses' in the Cinema Pantheon.  Either she or her directors believe that simply keeping the camera on her while she purses her lips and widens her eyes is something akin to acting.  It is not.Tom Hanks, perhaps the luckiest actor in the history of film, (don't get me started on his TWO Oscars) does a fine job throughout the island portions of the film, but falls completely on his face in the God awful last half hour of the film.Here comes the spoiler.  Although anybody who has sat through the preview has seen it by now!! (nice marketing in Hollywood nowadays!!) Once he returns to the mainland and attempts to reconcile with Hunt's character, we are reminded how mediocre a film this truly is.I continue to be shocked that Zemeckis would actually have Hanks 'standing in the crossroads' of his life!!  This kind of blatantly stupid visual metaphor, not only insults the audience's intelligence, but is simply laughable!I would have been content with Hanks' travails on the island, clearly the most interesting and believable portions of this film.  I can't help but wonder if this would have been a much better movie with less known actors, and at least half an hour less screentime.This film aims squarely at the lowest intellect in the audience, and by that standard, it wins.A sad waste of celluloid.",4,2,4,28 December 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Beautiful, Majestic, Powerful Martial Arts Saga!
","Yes, this film is indeed a saga.  Ang Lee has described it as Jane Austen meets Bruce Lee, and he is obviously right on the money! 
The design elements are majestic and the visuals linger in your memory long after you are finished watching this wonderful film.  I'm sure this movie is way above most audience member's heads.  First and foremost, it's in Chinese, which must scare away about 99.9 percent of U.S. audiences.  Too bad, for they are missing the best film so far this year! 
I loved the way the script handled so many characters and subplots without once losing control or interest.  The acting was uniformly good, but it is the beauty of the shots and the powerful wizardry of the martial arts scenes that really transcend the medium.  This film completely elevates you along with the magically endowed characters flights above the rooftops.  It is amazing how Lee manages to balance the supernatural elements with the period drama.  I'm sure this film will not please everyone.  It belongs in the pantheon with such beautiful works as Metropolis, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even The Wizard of Oz.  It is pure FILM MAGIC!  It surpasses the genre of Kung Fu Flicks, practically rewriting the genre.  You have to be a true cinephile to enjoy work this beautiful, and this rich in film imagery.The ending is truly beautiful, and perfectly closes the chapter on the many subplots involved in the film.  Ang Lee is truly a film genius.  He is the descendant of Howard Hawks and William Wellmann, who managed to direct many different genres of film and succeed admirably well in all of them.  I can't imagine any other director alive today who could excel in the films Mr. Lee has chosen to direct. 
If you love movies, truly love them for their visual poetry and storytelling, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",10,0,0,12 December 2000
The Sixth Sense," Most Overrated Film in the Past 25 Years!
","****CONTAINS SPOILER****WARNING!****WARNING!***** Where to begin?  I'm not usually surprised at the bad taste of filmgoers, making such colossal hits out of Home Alone and The Lost World, however this film takes the cake.  I enjoyed the performances, particularly Toni Colette, Haley Joel Osment, and the vastly under-appreciated Bruce Willis.  However, as much as I admire some aspects of the film, the denouement is so predictable and frankly, insulting to any thinking adult, that the success of this film astounds me.  If the film had been like 'The Crying Game' where the 'surprise' twist is interesting, but more importantly,  a mere plot device to further the film in it's storyline, I might have had less problems with this movie.  I was shocked that anybody would have been fooled for a moment about the health of Bruce Willis' character.  If American audiences are dimwitted and unobservant not to notice the THOUSANDS of obvious hints that preceed the unveiling of the truth, then this is the film for them.  It was insulting to have to sit through the final minutes of the film, being forced to relive earlier scenes that any intelligent moviegoer should already have noticed.  The mere fact that Willis doesn't change his clothes ONCE should have tipped off everybody!Well, my comments certainly won't stop those people that make hits of such movies as this, but I must raise my voice in protest since the last year has seen such incredible  movies as Three Kings, Magnolia, Election, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Boys Don't Cry, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Topsy-Turvy, Eyes Wide Shut, The Straight Story, Sweet & Lowdown, All About My Mother, and underappreciated gems like The Limey and Go, and a half dozen more that will be remembered much longer than this slim piece of celluloid.",2,1,2,8 March 2000
