Requiem for a Dream," A powerful, must see flick
","I saw this movie on my one year sobriety birthday from drugs and alcohol and I left the theater red faced, snot dripping from my nose, tears mixed with mascara, smeared all over my face. I was an absolute mess. I cried for about 40 minutes after the movie ended too. This movie truly captures the darkness of addiction and the pain caused to all those afflicted and all those associated with. Its a powerful, must see flick. Ellen Burstin did an outstanding job. It doesn't get much better than that. She knocked it out of the park!! She deserved an Oscar for that performance. Darren Arnofsky has created a fine, fine piece of work that will last a lifetime. Job well done!",10,1,2,21 December 2005
