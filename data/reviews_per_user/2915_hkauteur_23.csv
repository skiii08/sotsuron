Captain Phillips," HK Auteur Review - Captain Phillips
","The most noteworthy aspect of Paul Greengrass' canon is his ability to create immediacy, which is the key ingredient in Captain Phillips. The surface explanation behind Greengrass's crackling visual style is simply that he shoots hand-held. The truth is much more complicated than that. What's behind Greengrass' method is not merely the shaky cam, but his ability to create reality and punctuate immediate tension in his dramatic filmmaking. He understands that people receive information in fragments all the time and has found a way to incorporate that human reflex into a cinematic experience. So even with the fast cuts and shaky photography, the audience is able to follow what's going on. It is emotionally connective.The set pieces in the first half of the film are visceral and tense. They feel like they're happening right before us and we are immersed into the crew's helpless dilemma. There's a significant genre shift in the second act, as the film becomes a rescue mission procedural. It goes on a bit long by the end. The first half is definitely more fun than the second half, if only because the crew members become less active in the latter portions.Tom Hanks plunges into the title role in a way I haven't seen in years. The trademark Tom Hanks movie star charm is removed and what remains is Hank's everyman quality. Captain Richard Phillips comparatively is a relatively colder character compared to Hank's past roles, which frees him up to embody the role. The last few moments of Hanks' Captain Phillips in shock dealing with the aftermath is breathtaking. It's a great human moment, though overall the entire performance is probably not Oscar worthy.The Somali pirates are well casted. It's baffling how the filmmakers found these actors in a casting session in North Carolina. They rise above their skinny appearances and rough-hewn looks and each individually play dimensional characters. Greengrass builds an interesting group dynamic between them and gives them a backstory that suggests that they are not intentionally evil people.Something noteworthy is how Greengrass depicts the military in a cold neutral fashion that doesn't take political sides. They aren't glorified like they are in Michael Bay films. The military here is functional and follows procedures to get the job done. There's a lot of room for audiences to bring in their own views about the response time of the coast guard, the military's handling of the rescue or the harsh circumstances of the Somali pirates. Although interested in world issues in a journalistic fashion, Greengrass isn't overbearingly preachy in any sense. His focus is the drama and fully delivers on that.",8,0,1,8 November 2013
Gravity," HK Auteur Review - Gravity
","In my opinion, the key to making special effects convincing on screen is designing the effect to look somewhere between real and unreal. When the audience can't figure out what's real and what's not, they will believe it. This is what happened to me during Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity.Since Children of Men, Alfonso Cuarón takes his love of the long take and brings it to new levels. I couldn't figure out how these long shots were accomplished. The camera floats freely around the astronauts in space in long takes, occasionally shifting from third person perspective to first person. The camera loops, twirls, corkscrews around space, completely forgoing the human sense of up and down. It looked like the cameraman was really floating around with the actors. I knew that wasn't possible. But eventually I tapped out and let the movie spectacle just wash over me.As science fiction thematically explores the extreme potential of mankind, awe is an important component to every science fiction story. I was in sheer awe through the entirety of Gravity. Firstly, outer space and the beauty of Earth from a distance awed me. Then there was the solemn beauty of witnessing the space stations being decimated in space. I began to marvel at the destruction and momentarily thought deep thoughts. It was as if for a second I was watching waves wash ashore on a beach while reading J. Krishnamurti. Finally, I was awed by the fragility of human life. After all, all astronauts are just little fishes trying to survive out of their own habitat. The experience was otherworldly, self-reflective and dangerous all at the same time.I walked into Gravity mistakenly thinking it was a George Clooney vehicle. To my surprise, it's a Sandra Bullock movie. Sandra Bullock has always had a natural personable quality on screen. Whether it was pining for her crush to awaken from a coma in While You Were Sleeping or driving a bus that's primed to explode in Speed, she's always able to draw the audience into her plight with vulnerability. Bullock's characters never feel above the audience. Often this quality of hers get overlooked from having to play cheerful funny characters in romantic comedies.In Gravity, that quality is used to its full extent. We watch as she struggles to survive a series of obstacles. Her performance is as immersive as the special effects. She draws you in completely into her plight. I wish more depth were given to her character. By the beginning of the third act, the film starts to run low on its spectacle and it came to the moment where more character was needed for a bigger statement. Gravity elected to stay with its spectacle and jetted for the finish line. It had a good ending, but it was missing that final thematic punch that answers, 'What is this story ultimately about?' and 'Why am I watching this?'And for that, Gravity is a great gem and one exhilarating thrill ride. I am even happy that it was a great role for Sandra Bullock. I just do not know if the thrills will be as compelling on subsequent viewings. So in the end, it is not a masterpiece, but a very awesome movie nonetheless.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8,8,11,24 October 2013
This Is the End," HK Auteur Review - This Is The End
","First off, I want to say I am a fan of the Judd Apatow team. Before Judd Apatow made The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up, I wasn't really into the American comedies that were dominated by Ben Stiller, Will Ferrel and Vince Vaughn. The improvisational nature of Apatow's comedy and the crude sophomoric jokes infused with a heartfelt message hit me on a deeper level. As a lover of buddy cop movies, I'm also generally a sucker for bromance movies, of which I would argue is a close relative. Most of all, I like Apatow's cast of actors. Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Michael Cera, James Franco... they're all funny in their own idiosyncratic way and seem to have free reign over their own personas.This brings me to my first critique of This is the End. The central gag of having the actors play themselves isn't as funny as the film thinks it is. For example, This is the End's version of Michael Cera is a foul-mouthed cocaine addict. Why? Because the filmmakers thought it'd be funny to do a total reversal on Cera's real life persona. That gag is only truly funny if we know what Michael Cera is like in real life. Most of us, unlike the filmmakers, can only drawn upon Michael Cera's timid on screen persona. That creates enough of a contrast to elicit laughs and it does. However, the filmmakers are ultimately more connected to the joke than the audience can ever be, and that is problematic on some level. I get the feeling I should be laughing harder than the film is making me.Just to reiterate, I did laugh. There were times when the celebrity gag won me over. I liked how the character relationships were set up and they all have great chemistry. Jay Baruchel plays the audience's avatar and reacts to all colors of obnoxious behavior exhibited by the other actors. Actually, the film even takes it one comedic step further. When Danny McBride enters the film, he does his brand of obnoxious behavior that happens to be so overwhelming, the other annoying actors call him on it and ask him to stop.When the film doesn't rely on the celebrity gag and gives something for the characters to do to survive the Apocalypse, it's much more creative and funnier. I liked the graphic novel-like style that went into the world creation of the apocalypse. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg deliver some surprises to what's going on outside James Franco's house. The parts in between that didn't pertain to surviving the Apocalypse are strung by improvisational dialogue scenes and they stick out as the weaker moments. I recognize the ability to improvise scenes and be funny on camera, but watching the cast react to the fantastical elements was more interesting than watching the celebrities react to each other. As the audience's avatar, Jay Baruchel ends up being outnumbered as he is the only genuine likable character in a cast of six. So for somebody isn't already warm to these actors, they easily come off as very unlikable. And that can get taxing rather quickly. The writing isn't doing enough to build enough character for the cast and the film is completely reliant on what we know of these actors and their past works.Due to its leaning towards it's own self-referential quality than being a apocalyptic survival film, This is the End is ultimately a fan film for the Judd Apatow audience. (Think Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back for Kevin Smith's Viewaskew Universe) If you never liked any of the comedies from the Judd Apatow team, this movie isn't going to convert you. If you don't like none of these actors, I'd tell you to just skip it altogether. I am part of the Apatow audience and like these actors, and even with that, it felt like watching one gigantic inside joke.",7,1,4,14 October 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," HK Auteur Review - Star Trek Into Darkness
","The crew of the USS Enterprise meets an unstoppable force of terror from within Starfleet, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction.The central relationship between Kirk and Spock is the most compelling element out of the entire Star Trek canon. My peers frequently debate me about Star Trek: The Next Generation but my viewing experience of TNG has only been the movies. Unfortunately I missed it as a television series. For my money, there's been nothing nearly as compelling and iconic as Kirk's hot-blooded brash instinct versus Spock's cold logic and the temperamental humane Dr. McCoy caught between them. I love what they each represent and their eternal triangular quarrel. They want to work together to solve grandiose problems but they all see different on the approach. Never does one of them ever solve the solution completely with their own philosophy and often it's a varying combination of all three that saves the day. It's about hearing people out, being unassuming and adapting to new ideas. When Star Trek: The Original Series debuted in the mid-60's, Gene Roddenberry intended the original show to have a major political agenda and aimed to present an optimistic version of what man can be at their very best.Much of the essence from Star Trek: The Original Series remains in Star Trek Into Darkness, it contains themes about colonialism, political intervention, foreign policy and terrorism. But it is there only if you want to read it. These themes are expressed in a muted fashion as the thematic discussions are always running parallel to major action set pieces. As if the material was like a shark that had to keep moving at breakneck speed or it will risk dying of boredom. Personally, I never minded those thematic discussions in the previous Star Trek films. A few more quiet moments wouldn't have been bad either. Just saying. Now that J.J. Abrams is helming the next Star Wars movie, the 'Star Wars vs. Star Trek' geek war that existed when I was a teenager might very well be over now. A Star Wars influence is present in the film and I ponder what elements Abrams will bring over.The script is workshopped to an inch of its life. Heck, it's indicative in the film's 'no colon' title. The fact that the writers have been quoted stating that 'There's no word that comes after the colon after Star Trek that's cool.' has been clearly spent way too much time pulling their hair psychotically, obsessing over every detail and perfecting the story over coffee-spilled paper. Seriously, is there really a group of people out there that feels negative about colons after the movie title? Does that really justify warping (yes, pun intended) English grammar? This sounds like ranting but I really mean this as a compliment to their supposed geek madness.The cast delivers as they did in the previous installment. I do think having watched the previous installment helps immensely as there are not a lot of character building moments for everybody. But the actors are all well casted in their roles and fortunately every crew member still has something to do. Zachary Quinto shines as Spock and his friendship with Chris Pine's Kirk is a believable one. Their friendship is the heart of the movie. Simon Pegg gets to do something new as Scotty. Benedict Cumberbatch is a great villain. He owns the audience. One minute he is savagely evil, the next minute we slightly sympathize with him and then he shifts again. On that note, I can't wait for Sherlock season 3.This is a very ambitious film that has a lot of things to accomplish. It's trying to deliver a story with multiple characters, please both the non-fans and the fans, go to new territory but also honor the spirit of the original series. The film essentially wants to have its cake and eat it too but it accomplishes it really well. If J.J. Abrams' gave any more pop culture nods as he does in this film, his head would fall off. I cheered at the spectacle of the action scenes, laughed at the in-jokes, and almost cried at the film's climax. It doesn't go to new territory as much as the first one and I hope they do go somewhere new for the next installment.I want to see it again and look forward to the third installment. Hopefully it won't take as long as this one.For more reviews, please visit my blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",9,4,8,21 May 2013
About Time," HK Auteur Review - About Time
","As a story that involves time travel, About Time doesn't even follow it's established time travel rules. The most impressive part of it is, the movie is so charming with human warmth, none of that even matters.I found myself not even caring about the broken rules. In fact, to be honest, I was so charmed and immersed into the story and characters I did not notice the rules were broken long after the movie was over. Plot hole zealots will have a ball nitpicking this film to oblivion but those who do will completely miss the film's point. Curtis' interest doesn't lie in science fiction spectacle; the time travel explanation itself is as unscientific as it gets.Curtis' priorities lie upon human matters, which brings me to the characters. The film is well casted. As a romantic lead, Domhall Gleeson has an everyman quality that believably would have struggles dating women. That's a common complaint I have with a lot of romantic comedies generally. Glesson seems like a normal bloke whose charm needs time to grow on someone as opposed to being immediately charming with practiced swagger. Rachel McAdams is adorable and shows good comic timing. She's played a similar role before in Morning Glory, which was one of my favorites that year. Again, unlike a lot of romance stories, McAdams' allure doesn't hang solely on her beauty. The Mary character is smart, funny and an interesting person. More importantly, she is the type of the girl one would marry and take home to your parents.Bill Nighy is Curtis's secret ingredient and is the heart of the film. It's a subtle minimalist performance, as if Nighy played the scenes as honestly as he could without adding any character quirks or anything an actor would do to purposely chew up the scenery. Nighy is an amicable presence, is effortlessly hilarious with his deliveries and inflections of every piece of dialogue he's given.There's also a great cast of supporting characters that cover a variety of character quirks that I don't even want to spoil here. They all have their little arcs and I think it's probably a better experience to discover them while you're watching the film.The main point is that Richard Curtis used time traveling as a metaphor to say something profound about life. He captures moments of life's joy and sadness. In doing so, the film is more than the sum of its parts. I was warmed by Curtis' optimistic view of life and the sincere message he conveyed in About Time. For a guy that doesn't cry at movies, I can say that other people will by the film's end. Heck, I probably would have enjoyed it more if I could roll a tear.This is probably the one of the best movies I have seen this year. If it doesn't stay on my top ten by the end of 2013, it would be very surprising.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",9,2,4,22 October 2013
Don Jon," HK Auteur Review - Don Jon
","Don Jon marks as the debut film of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is the writer, director and star of the film. What's most praiseworthy about JGL's direction is how he puts the audience into the world view of his lead character Don Jon. It makes a good cinematic explanation of how Don Jon prefers pornography over bedding real women, a character trait that can easily be viewed as unlikeable or disgusting if mishandled. We never really venture outside his world, but yet Don Jon's views seem logical enough to keep the audience invested in what happens to him.Directing duties aside, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's ability to transform himself amazes me. Having seen him in Inception, (500) Days of Summer and The Dark Knight Rises have familiarized me with the sound of his real voice, but I was still astounded by Don Jon's macho New Jersey-accented voice. I was carefully listening to Don Jon's dialogue and couldn't detect any hints of Gordon-Levitt's real voice underneath. It is artfully consistent and was the core element that sold me on the Don Jon character.Scarlett Johansson has been said to be a wooden actress in the past. I think this was probably one of her better performances. This character felt like a real person to me. I have met and dated girls like Barbara. Furthermore, the allure of Scarlett Johansson is cinematically ramped up to eleven. She hasn't been filmed to this level of sexiness since Match Point. For fans of the Black Widow, I'd even argue that this tops that. This is probably more to the credit of the direction. We feel Don Jon's hunger for her. And like Don Jon, she too mesmerized me. And not just cause of her looks. She seemed like the ideal girlfriend at first and couldn't really see her character flaws till late in the film. When I realized her character flaws, I was surprised I didn't see them before. That was a very compelling moment for me in the theater. Honestly, Johansson's character distracted me so much, I would need a second viewing to tell you anything about the Julianne Moore character.Seeing Tony Danza as Don Jon's father Jon Sr. takes me back to my childhood. He was the only man on TV who can make my dad cackle like a fiend in the English language. Danza's presence adds warmth and makes for a convincing father. Brie Larson gets to do a Silent Bob type gag that is quite amusing.The film's brutally truthful display about the realities of men and women as a source for comedy, while handled tastefully with charm by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, hits a little too close to home. I have had discussions like this with a girlfriend similar to the Scarlett Johansson character. It accurately captures why it's hard for men to explain the joys of pornography to the opposite sex. As Louis C.K. once put it, men just need to release so they don't go out and murder somebody. That's really it, but it's not a pleasing satisfying statement to convince a girlfriend with. I'd argue that any girl that needs an explanation wouldn't be convinced anyways because they probably have double standards. The film seems to take the same stance. All that said, the film managed to end on a poignant tender note.In the end, Don Jon is somewhat of an odd animal. I wouldn't personally recommend it as a date movie with your girlfriend, for the very fact that it might just open the awkward discussion of 'How much pornography do you watch?' with your girlfriend. I still think people should see it as it is a competent debut film.So on a more politically neutral note, I'd say guys would have more fun with it watching it with their guy friends and likewise with girls and their girlfriends. It's probably better to be charmed by it separately than leaving the theater together primed for an awkward argument.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8,8,13,9 October 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," HK Auteur Review - Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy
","I cannot fault you for not liking Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. It demands that you keep up with it wholeheartedly with 100% undivided attention. Once you put in all the work the film is demanding and fully immerse into its hypersensitive world of subtleties, it becomes a rewarding experience. A blink feels like a gunshot. A facial tick becomes a car chase. Everybody is looking behind their backs.Director Tomas Alfredson does nothing to make it easy either. Let's list the things: 1) The story has a non-linear plot structure that the audience needs to piece together. 2) There is no explanation for the spy lingo. 3) The audience must play detective along with George Smiley, tracking who said what to whom, matching it to what was said in a previous scene to deduce if they are lying. Lying is an art form in itself. Are they lying entirely? Or just omitting a detail? What motivates a lie?The film completely functions on a thematic level. Gary Oldman said in an BBC5 interview that director Tomas Alfredson doesn't even think he made a spy thriller, which confirms my point. This is not a story about espionage at all. No, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is about mistrust. It's about these men confined in tight spaces perpetually spying on each other and how it alienates them apart. Humanity is a weakness and compromises their survival as spies. Every character in the film battles with their own humanity to survive. There is a great scene where Gary Oldman's George Smiley lies to another character with a perfect poker face. The bleak coldness that he exudes is intense and shocking. The subplot with Smiley's wife artfully gives insight to the Smiley character. We never get a good look at the wife because she exists as an idea - she is the deal he has to make with the devil. Home is where Smiley is at his most vulnerable and we see the consequences of Smiley's commitment to his cold-hearted profession.Since I'm a Sherlock fan, I loved seeing Benedict Cumberbatch rise through the ranks into films now. He's great as Gary Oldman's younger sidekick who is still wet behind the ears. I look forward to seeing him in the next Star Trek movie. Please don't make him play Khan. It would be a waste. Toby Jones' face screams red herring. Alfredson films Jones in a way that makes him look like an evil leprechaun, similar to how Sergio Leone's penchant for filming faces as if they were landscapes.Speaking of which, this film has great cinematography in that it tells the story. The film is about discovering truth amongst a cloud of lies and the cinematography really serves that idea visually. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema has managed to find layers of shadow in places that I didn't know exist, like the backseat of a car. The camera moves, like the pan shots, really give a sense of place that constructs the moody, smoky, morally ambiguous atmosphere. With the long lenses, the audience is looking into the lives of these spies seated in tight spaces, as if we are watching them suffocate.Something really noteworthy is how they utilized is Gary Oldman's glasses as a plot device. Yes, Hint! Notice George Smiley's glasses in every scene. It's used like Maggie Cheung's dresses in In The Mood For Love. What's genius about is it forces you to look at Gary Oldman's eyes, which both guides your eyes to his performance and immerses you along with his investigation of what's going on as he interviews each suspect.Hands down, Gary Oldman should win the Oscar. I couldn't take my eyes off of him. How does an actor underplay a role to this degree and still manage to be this engaging? Due to the Academy's usual taste of rewarding showy loud performances, it seems unlikely Oldman will win the gold statuette. It's a subtle performance completely constructed around what he's not showing and what he is not saying. But at least the Academy recognized the brilliance of his performance. It's a step, right?For more reviews, please visit my film blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",9,0,2,2 September 2013
Pacific Rim," HK Auteur Review - Pacific Rim
","As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.The fights are the main attraction. You either go along with that premise or not, there's no two ways about it. In reality, it's probably more resourceful to bomb these giant monsters or shoot them with a very big cannon, instead of making giant robots to punch them to death. But where's the fun in that? Suffice to say, the fights are a tense visceral experience and the scale of everything delivers an epic sense of awe. They do everything to up the ante and surprise the audience. Special moves are only used in climatic moments and there's just something about a giant robot using a boat as a bat that's just hilarious and jaw-dropping. These fights run very dangerously to the cinematic equivalent of watching somebody play a video game. That's why I like the drifting mind meld concept, because it solves that problem by it properly adding both physical and emotional conflict to the pilots controlling the Jaegers as well. It focuses to how well these pilots are controlling the Jaegers as opposed to how the Jaegers are fighting the Kaijus.The fights are shot somewhat tightly but for a very good reason. Shooting the fights close holds the tension and injects the sense of jeopardy and stake into every exchange in the fight choreography. I imagine if the fights were covered entirely in long wide shots, it would lose that sense of scale and the fights would look silly. That said, I had no problem following what's going on because emotionally it felt right to be watching them that way. And personally, it was doubly fun that the film was set in Hong Kong.There's been a common complaint that the characters lacked development, I disagree. Basically these people all have baggage and they have to band together as a team or fall apart. The film spends time building arcs for its ensemble cast, and it's sufficient to justify the epic robot monster fights. That's it, so I don't understand that complaint. Adding neat little quirks or oddball idiosyncrasies to these characters would have been overkill.The dialogue is one of the film's weaker portions. However, depending on how well each actor was able to milk the lines, I was still able to have fun with it. I couldn't stop cackling at Charlie Day's fast-paced high-pitched deliveries, who rises above being 'Dr. Exposition' and balances the film with comic relief. Day's exchange with the rival math-based scientist played by Burn Gorman is essentially a cartoon-level quarrel equivalent to Daffy Duck arguing with Bugs Bunny. The math Gorman's scientist applies is is grade-school at best. Ron Perlman facetiously entertains in flying colors as the Kaiju body parts black marketer Hannibal Chau, the most asshole character name ever created. Idris Elba also adds significant weight as the team leader. So for me, the side characters take the cake from the Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi storyline, which was played very straight for story purposes.Guillermo del Toro is aware of current big-budget blockbuster tropes and differentiates himself from those trends in Pacific Rim. There are no homage or geek references to distract or alienate the audience. Rinko Kikuchi's Mako character is not sexualized or filmed through a salivating male gaze; she is a real human character with a story and treated as such. The film doesn't play like a military recruitment advertisement nor has any blatant nationalistic or jingoistic intentions. Perhaps one of my favorite things about Pacific Rim is it tonally divorces itself from post-9/11 sentimentality. The world has its own distinct fictional reality, where destruction is not linked by evoking imagery, memories or emotions from September 11th. Civilians evacuate from buildings, hide in shelters and the streets are clear for the Jaegers to bash the Kaijus. Most importantly, del Toro never dwells heavily on despair or hopelessness and the audience can enjoy the city-wide destruction guilt-free. All those things counted together, Pacific Rim is truly a breath of fresh air amidst current blockbuster aesthetics and a film made with the most earnest intentions.Without an A-list star, a love story or a recognizable established franchise (i.e. Godzilla or Transformers) , it's not hard to see why Pacific Rim didn't score at the box office. As Snakes On A Plane proved at its theatrical release, the geek fan base doesn't represent much of the core population. The geeks merely are just the most vocal. Perhaps other parts of the demographic are alienated just by the material itself, despite that del Toro is aiming to entertain everybody. If there's one underdog movie people should give a chance to this summer, let it be Pacific Rim. It's a passionate earnest film made by a director that loves the material and wants to deliver good clean fun with a positive message for everybody. His attention to every little detail exudes his excitement for the material; that passion rubbed off on me and elevated my enjoyment. It's the most fun I've had watching a movie this summer. Guillermo del Toro, give me a hug!For more reviews, please visit and subscribe to my blog - http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8,6,9,27 July 2013
American Hustle," HK Auteur film review - American Hustle
","David O. Russell's latest caper American Hustle is fundamentally more interested in its characters than doing anything with them.The story is a fictionalized account of the FBI ABSCAM operation in the late 1970s. Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale), a con man, falls in love with Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), and the couple start running a con operation together. Everything seems perfect at first, but Irving refuses to leave his adopted son and wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), who refuses to divorce him. When FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, they are forced to help him make four arrests for their release.What happens with the characters never matches the depth of their characterizations. As the narrative switches perspectives and cross-sections into the inner monologue of several characters, it keeps the viewer perpetually wondering who is the main character of the story. The con, or more specifically the plot, is cast to the side. The joy of watching the construction of the con is not present; O. Russell is not interested in those nuts and bolts.Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are all very good and very free in their parts. Louis C.K. even has a funny supporting role as Bradley Cooper's FBI superior who is frequently bullied. Despite of the nominations, the acting is not Oscar worthy. It just seems like it should be.O. Russell directs like an acting coach running a class exercise, having the actors improvise scenes and go off script to no end. The scenes do feel raw and unrehearsed. At its best, energy is building and chaos seems to be imminent, like a lit fuse burning its way to the end of a dynamite stick that we cannot see. At its worst, it feels plodding and going over information we already know. The inverse effect is it makes the actors, as good as they are in their parts, look like they are playing dress up. So as much as it wants to be an anarchic character study, the final result is oddly shallow.American Hustle does not quite live up to its awards hype. The truth is, it was over-hyped from the beginning, and somehow David O. Russell has everybody believing he has made something good. Or somehow the people just want to believe he has made something good. Good for him, but I really doubt anybody will be talking about this film six months from now when the hype dies down.

Man of Steel," HK Auteur Review - Man of Steel
","The story of Superman, a character created during World War II, is dated by today's standards. The fragility of his dual identity is never touched upon. The supposed smart career woman who he's in love with never sees through his disguise as Clark Kent. He's all powerful, doesn't lie and always does the right thing. Nothing can physically hurt him except Kryptonite. How do you find conflict for this character? How can he grow? What is there for him to learn? This makes Superman a writer's nightmare. The original material has written itself into a corner. It's clear that the filmmakers' goal was to undo many of these trappings and update Superman to a real modern context. Content aside, I'm a Christopher Nolan fan but I have never liked any of Zack Snyder's films. What would be the end result of a Nolan-produced Zack Snyder production? Would they accomplish their goals? This left me going in with an open mind.Henry Cavill makes both a great Clark Kent and Superman. Surprisingly much of it is a silent performance, as he has minimal dialogue and communicates a lot of the inner turmoil through his face. The story gives him a lot to play and watching Clark grow into Superman step-by-step make up for the the most interesting segments. When he makes the choice to become Superman, we feel the gravity of that choice. The film is called Man of Steel for that very reason.Lois Lane is the trickiest part to cast out of all the characters. The career-driven overachieving qualities of Lois Lane, if not balanced correctly, can easily make her into a bitch. She should be a jerk, but a likable jerk. It's in Superman's overwhelming presence where her heartier side slowly surfaces. Amy Adams nails the career woman part of Lois from her first scene. The heartier side she plays out convincingly as well but unfortunately the romance is a bit rushed. I would have liked to see Lois's vulnerable side melt away slower and have it unfold in a sequel.Russell Crowe gives the film an engaging energetic kickstart as Jor-el; he puts an enthusiasm into this role he hasn't in years. Michael Shannon brings a ferocious intensity to General Zod, who's written as more complex and more relatable than Terrence Stamp's version. I believe his motivation and anger. Laurence Fishburne is always a welcome presence and makes a fine Perry White, but what is up with that diamond earring? Is that suitable for work?Kevin Costner is the heart of the movie as Jonathan Kent. He and Diane Lane make really convincing on-screen parents. Both are real-life parents and there's something about how being a parent that physically changes the way carry yourself that's hard to fabricate. That quality is captured effectively here and the values the Kents instill into Clark echoes throughout the film. Martha Kent's first scene with a young Clark at school almost moved me to tears.Hans Zimmer's music punctuates the film's goal by scoring a 'Man of Steel' theme as opposed to a Superman theme. There's no distinct attempt at trying to capture Superman's presence with musical keys, the emphasis is the man himself. This separates it from John William's class original score. The bombastic loud soaring god- like moments are operatic, and the quieter human moments show a lonely man moving from contemplation towards action.Zack Snyder makes good directorial choices. Snyder's held back with his trademark slow motion shots and thank goodness for that. The hand-held cinematography effectively grounds the scenes, particularly the childhood scenes in Smallville evoke Terrence Malick films. The non-linear flashbacks is a great choice as it mixes things up for an origin story that we have seen before. It was more interesting we didn't have to go through it linearly.The finale is too long, partly it's a reaction from all the complaints of no action from Superman Returns. People have been talking about the issue of too much destruction. It's more that a lot of the destruction is caused by Superman himself. He seems unaware of his surroundings and is actively using the surrounding buildings to hurt his enemies. This would have been nullified if Cavill's Superman just saved more civilians between the fights and if the aftermath of the destruction was addressed by the media. Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh's versions had no problem multi-tasking. The only one Superman power that wasn't shown was the super breath, and there were many instances he could have used that power to put out a few fires. Maybe Superman hasn't learned that power yet but he could have used his powers more creatively as well. On a tangential note, I loved the design of the heat vision. There was a destructive 'last resort' quality that looked scary and painful to fire out of your eyes.Finally, some people might feel cheated by or downright reject these changes to the Superman mythos, but these changes properly inject the necessary weaknesses that can set this version of Superman on a journey with enough lessons to learn for subsequent films (assuming they're making at least three of these including a Justice League movie). The new places they go with Superman were ultimately what thrilled me and the quiet human moments were what moved me. Personally I would have traded 10 minutes out of the finale for 10 more minutes in Smallville.I look forward to where they take this version of Superman. Depending on which direction of the next film may affect how I feel about Man of Steel because there are a lot of things that are left unfinished that can be fixed in the sequel (i.e. the romance, the aftermath of the damage, Superman saving more people, how the world is reacting to his presence). It's time to cast Lex Luthor!",8,2,4,21 October 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," HK Auteur film review - Dallas Buyers Club
","In 1985, Ron Woodroff (Matthew McConaughey), an electrician and avid rodeo enthusiast with homophobic views, contracts the HIV virus and is given 30 days to live. His doctor Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), tells him about the testing of an anti-viral drug named AZT – a drug thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. Discovering that AZT is actually harmful, he switches to other non-FDA approved drugs ddC and peptide T and partners with Rayon, a transgender woman (Jared Leto), and creates the Dallas Buyers Club, providing drugs to patients for a membership fee.Making his resurgence this year with a return to dramatic roles, Matthew McConaughey dives into the Ron Woodroff character with an incomparable passion and commitment in years. The monologue McConaughey delivered in the finale of A Time to Kill sent chills down my spine years ago, and since then I have been waiting for years for him to quit doing romantic comedies and now the wait is finally over. Looking dangerously emaciated and painfully frail, McConaughey brings a complex humanity beneath the swindling, trashy, rude exterior in Ron Woodroff. Never in any circumstance would you ever want to hang out with Woodroff, but you feel sympathy for his plight and cheer him on as he rids of his homophobia and starts helping other people. This is McConaughey's career best.From the sparse art-house way he chooses his parts and dividing time with his music career, Jared Leto has gone unnoticed under the radar, most people still only remember him from My So-Called Life. Rayon is the single most compelling on screen character I have seen this year. Leto tackles the role with such love and human warmth, breathing charm and a sense of humor into Rayon, the role transcends from being a flamboyant woman trapped inside a man's body but a human being who desires to be truly loved. As Rayon tells her estranged father in a scene, 'It's not a choice.' I would never presume to know the life experience of transgender people, but after seeing Leto's deeply moving performance I feel much closer. Campaign or awards politics aside, both actors should win the Oscars, period.Director Jean-Marc Vallée adopts a hand-held cinéma vérité style that brings rawness and immediacy, taking its heavy subject matter head-on and naturally lets the characters tell the story. Even with the latter introduction of the FDA subplot, the story never becomes a political debate about whether the law truly meets human needs. Dallas Buyers Club is a fascinating, powerfully moving story and told passionately by its makers. It is one of the year's best films.",9,2,2,2 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," HK Auteur Review - The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
","To start off, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan. I haven't read any of Tolkien's works and only have seen the Peter Jackson's film trilogy once. A friend invited me to a free screening of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug two days before its premiere, so I quickly caught up with the previous installment and read up on the film's production online to prepare for its sequel. So this is going to be a review of the first film too. Let's crack on My biggest problem with An Unexpected Journey is it launched its story retrospectively from Lord of the Rings, starting with an older Bilbo Baggins telling the story to Frodo Baggins just before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring. The Hobbit is not a prequel, it was written first before Lord of the Rings. It's the true 'part one' and yet it's being framed as if it was a prequel to a great trilogy. This effectively echoes throughout the two Hobbit films as I am constantly being reminded about what's to come. It's distracting and by association makes The Hobbit seem less important.Whether it's Peter Jackson's completist approach to expand the story or a corporate decision from the financiers to cash in on the success of the LOTR trilogy, The Hobbit is too long. Often the story takes big steps backwards before being able to move forwards. It took forty minutes in the first film to start the journey and for someone who is not coming in sheer excited fandom, the slow pace is a lot of work on the audience's part.This is the typical pattern of one story movement in The Hobbit series thus far: 1) An imminent crisis or problem faces our heroes 2) Backstory is given in context to our heroes to the crisis. 3) The group tries to persevere and just as they fail or are about to give up, Bilbo does something that solves the problem 4) The group rejoice about the pure spirit of Hobbits and how impressive it is, cue flute music 5) A new problem comes along. Repeat.Throughout both films, I had an internal monologue that kept screaming, 'Let's go! Hurry up!', as if I was watching someone play a video game at snail's pace. Die-hard LOTR fans will say that I am wrong about this but it's why those DVD extended editions exist. Even though we'll never know, Guillermo Del Toro's original idea of directing the The Hobbit as two films sounds better. But this is just something I'll have to accept. That's the extent of my issues because when The Desolation of Smaug is good, it is very good.Martin Freeman is a great Bilbo Baggins. The role requires exactly what Freeman plays best: acting quizzical from being one mental step ahead of everybody but always feels socially awkward about pointing out the obvious. Freeman's reactions are entertaining and overall I find Bilbo a much more engaging protagonist than Frodo; he gets things done.Smaug the dragon is frightening. Benedict Cumberbatch injects an immense sense of threat and power into Smaug's voice, combined with its gigantic size, creates a memorable movie villain for the ages. It was bone-chilling watching the dragon slither around in the dark, with the imminent feeling he can squash Bilbo at any moment. Hands down, the Smaug scene is the best scene in all five films so far.The beautiful Evangeline Lilly as Tauriel is a welcome addition to the series. Despite of being Jackson's creation, she is a well-rounded strong female character that adds a love story. Orlando Bloom returning as Legolas is neither her or there for me. He isn't an interesting character and seems to exist for his fighting abilities. Both elf characters are unnecessary filler material, but make entertaining filler no less. The dwarfs are more fleshed out in this installment, which is an improvement because there was nothing to distinct them apart from each other in the first film.nother minor quibble I had was the decision of using CGI in the action scenes. The orcs are computer-generated and the action sequences look digitally layered and video game-like. They're well designed and are well-paced action scenes. But the LOTR trilogy previously established a real world look with its use of New Zealand landscapes and creature make-up, and I wonder why Peter Jackson decided to go with more CGI as it doesn't match with the previous films.Peter Jackson's deep love for the material is felt throughout both films and this perhaps is the film's most winning quality. After all, Jackson's completist approach isn't self-indulgent or obnoxious, but out of a genuine love, awe and wonder for Middle Earth and its mythology. It's infectious and is probably the primary reason I was able to sit through the long running time.Overall, I enjoyed The Desolation of Smaug more than An Unexpected Journey. There is less setup to be done, hence the story moves along much faster. And for that reason alone, I think I will enjoy There and Back Again even more when things begin to wrap up.",8,1,5,15 December 2013
Django Unchained," HK Auteur Review - Django Unchained
","I'm just going to right into it...The best performance by a mile is Christoph Waltz - he is the heart of the movie. Waltz's Doctor King Schultz single-handedly balances the entire film, evening out the tone between moments of intense horror and humor and mediating the film's internal battle between historical fact and its post-modern aesthetic. He is the Yang to the film's Yin, filling out the missing part of the scenes and even providing a human perspective into what's happening when the audience does not what to feel in certain situations. Whenever Christoph Waltz is not in the movie, it is heavily felt.Leonardo DiCaprio's Calvin J. Candie is a great villain and brings a scary presence. Scary is something we haven't ever seen Dicaprio accomplish so it was quite fresh to see. He sings Tarantino's dialogue, projecting a charming demeanor on the surface while carrying a constant petty evil underneath. It's not Oscar worthy (if anything, he should have won for The Aviator) but a powerful performance nonetheless.Jamie Foxx's lead performance as Django seemed off to me. Particularly his voice threw me off because his inflections sound too modern. Everybody else seems to have an accent from the era, but he does not use a southern accent, or any accent. He just sounds like a black man from 2012. Django's progression of intelligence was unconvincing to me as well. There were times where he seemed dim-witted and other times where he seemed sharp, and it felt unnatural. It is not a screen writing issue, but in how the performance was delivered. It was as if Foxx focused on playing the 'Man with No Name' western genre hero and did not know how to balance it with the historical context of black slaves in America. He just did not carry enough pain in his eyes.I don't have words for Samuel L. Jackson's performance, it's quite the spectacle to behold. Watching it transported me into a weird nether place. Maybe I need to go leaf through a history book on slavery or something. I don't know what to make of it. And on that awkward note...However one may feel about Tarantino's frequent use of the N word, he definitely has a strange obsession with it. As horrible as this sounds, I was surprised how other racial slurs from that era were not spoken in the film. (I am not going to name them here. I will defer you to watch that scene in Clerks 2.) There is a quality in Tarantino's crass, in-your-face direction that suggests that he gets off rebelling against social taboos. That telling him that something is politically incorrect will push him to do it in order to disprove you. That's my speculation anyways.The film is way too long. Simply put, it's ill-disciplined in the sense that Tarantino wants his cake and eat it too. He wants to tell his story and communicate a statement but also wants to amuse himself by inserting things that he enjoys and cannot reign himself in. There is a gag where a major comedy star shows up in a cameo which I found problematic. In fact, it was problematic in the exact same way I found Mike Meyer's cameo was in Inglourious Basterds. In a film where it's trying to balance historical fact and a post-modern aesthetic by mediating film genres, seeing a modern comedic actor show up for a cheap laugh is just one extra layer too many and it took me out. Did the gag make me laugh? No. Did it progress the story? No. Then why is the gag there? Tarantino wants it to be, that's why.A reason that I prefer Django Unchained over Inglourious Basterds is that Tarantino doesn't try to make every scene into a dialogue set piece. The opening set piece in Inglourious Basterds is the best thing Tarantino has written (he says so too), but every proceeding scene seemed like he was trying to recreate that for the rest of the movie and it got tiring. There is a point in the Django Unchained's final act where the story could have concluded but it proceeds for another half hour. I could have cut 20 minutes out of the film and it is that exact 20 minutes that holds the film from being something masterful. Yes, that includes Tarantino's cameo. Tarantino shouldn't act in his own films. Maybe he shouldn't act at all in anything but he was the worst part of his own film.All that said, I enjoyed it much more than Inglourious Basterds ( I am so relieved it didn't end with a character uttering 'Hm, maybe THIS is my masterpiece.') Tarantino fans may love the extra fat, but I would have preferred a leaner steak with more discipline. It's just that little difference, if only Tarantino reigned himself in.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8,2,6,17 November 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," HK Auteur film review - The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
","Typically I am not a fan of Ben Stiller's comedy, whenever he dons a wig and plays a crazy character, it is one-note and awkward. Stiller fares best when he is a normal person reacting to an awkward situation as opposed to being the source of awkwardness and the nebbish Walter Mitty character certainly plays to those strengths. Stiller's other brand of 'costume play' comedy in the fantasy sequences is fortunately reduced to a minimal. Here he is at his most naturally charming and Zoolander fans may disagree, but this is now officially my favorite thing Ben Stiller has directed and acted in.Kristin Wiig is also naturally charming as Mitty's love interest and gets to shine in a musical sequence where she does a cover of David Bowie's Major Tom. Sean Penn has a funny supporting role as artsy photographer Sean O'Connell. Penn's trademark intensity is smartly sourced for laughs in a self-deprecating fashion similar to when Chris Rock quipped at Penn's humorless comeback over Jude Law at the Oscars.The production design is impressive, with its visual compositions practically lifted from hardcover graphic design books and nifty editing transitions accompanied with cool looking fonts, which to some extent owes itself to Stranger Than Fiction. Stuart Dryburgh's photography delivers a true sense of awe for New York's urban cityscape and Greenland's natural landscapes. The story reason is to make Walter Mitty look like an ant in a big world, but that overwhelming sense of the environment towering over man seeps over onto the audience.The reality of the film's own world is suspect, like the logistics of how an employee is able to leave work and fly off to a foreign country, or how much of a jerk the new corporate supervisor played by Adam Scott is being. None of this matters because the story is a fable after all. The viewer may feel in moments they need to give the story the benefit of the doubt. If that moment should occur, go along with it. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is imaginative and humorously made, and even in its weaker illogical moments is ultimately compensated by its charm. The lesson of someone who realizes he is missing out on life from daydreaming is just darn compelling, and it is emotionally cathartic watching Mitty wake up.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8,3,6,14 January 2014
Evil Dead," HK Auteur Review - Evil Dead
","Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of the Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.The three Evil Dead films is a trilogy of inconsistencies. The opening of Evil Dead 2 rewrites the events of first Evil Dead, and Army of Darkness' opening rewrites the conclusion of Evil Dead 2. The sequencing of events has always connected only inside the audience's minds as a complete storyline. My first-ever experience with the Evil Dead franchise wasn't watching the films but instead going to see Evil Dead Musical, which combined the first two Evil Dead story lines together (which in my opinion was much better). So I didn't know what a remake would mean in context to continuing the story or what kind of expectations to have for an Evil Dead remake. So to get right into it...The new Evil Dead... is so-so. I did not find the reason that justified this remake.The major issue with Evil Dead is that there is no X factor. It's neither funny or has a lead performance akin to Bruce Campbell's in the original that raises the piece above the sum of its parts. I'm not asking for either again. The story plays fast and loose with its characters, as a result we never genuinely know who we should be rooting for till it's too late. The typical stupid horror movie mistakes they make are unbelievably stupid. The lack of humor in itself is not a problem but there's no additional layer or emotion contrasting to what's going on. So the audience is left simply moving through the plot points, guessing who's turn it is to die next. That would be okay if we weren't already so familiar with the story. Evil Dead completely relies on its scares to entertain the audience alone, and somehow that falls short.The practical in-camera effects deserve praise, as they add effective weight to the scares and sufficient texture to the gore. The end result is quite cringe-worthy. Practical effects bring more weight to the spectacle than CGI and I applaud anyone who is not letting practical effects die. I suspect director Fede Alvarez would say the X factor is the gore and the scares. But after the Joss Whedon-produced Cabin in the Woods, I'm expecting more now by default. If only this movie was released first....It's been reported Sam Raimi is going to make Army of Darkness 2, which will connect to the events of this remake. He's free to do what he wants, but it's not going to improve this Evil Dead remake by any means. For that, viewers who haven't seen The Evil Dead will be probably enjoy this more. Fans of the original like myself would probably like this remake a lot more if it wasn't called Evil Dead.For more review, please visit and subscribe to my film blog - http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",5,0,9,28 July 2013
Prisoners," HK Auteur film review - Prisoners
","When Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads. But just how far will he go to protect his family?Prisoners has the strongest ensemble cast of 2013 and everybody brings their A game. Keller Dover is Hugh Jackman's most raw and complex role yet, as Jackman plays Dover's wavering belief of the justice system and descending morality to a realistic precision. Things get murky as Dover takes matters in his own hands on an unconfirmed suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) and traps himself between being desperate, angry and helpless.Jake Gyllenhaal, sporting a neck tattoo and facial tics, creates the realistically compelling Detective Loki. The character is a fascinating inward look to how police detectives conduct their investigations, interrogate suspects and how the job centers on being emotionally removed from the crime itself. Loki is even darkly funny at times because he is so distanced from the crime and committed to procedures that normal things seem outlandish to him.Roger Deakins's cinematography brings layers of shades into the perpetually cloudy and otherwise flat-looking suburbia. The moody atmosphere embodies a sinister undertone; whether the location is a forest, a kitchen or a washroom, it feels like someone is lurking behind the corner. Mirroring its main characters, the cinematography impressively supports the story with a growing sense of insecurity.Denis Villeneuve directs ambitiously, as Prisoners juggles between being a character study of two families dealing with a kidnapping, a crime mystery plot and the theme of the institution versus the individual. Retrospectively, in total Alfred Hitchcock-coined 'refrigerator logic' terms, the film does not entirely deliver on all three. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terrence Howard's characters do get sidetracked. The story thematically switches between whatever is the most interesting in the given moment, which in the moment is powerfully engaging.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",9,1,2,23 January 2014
The Departed," The Departed
","I have tried to within my power to show everyone the first Infernal Affairs before The Departed had come out. First of all, I want The Departed to do good. I guess in the long run it does good for Hong Kong cinema. However, it physically hurts me to see the Hollywood machine eating and going to be taking credit for this film much like Quentin Tarantino did for presenting Hero. The film's title is 'Quentin Tarantino presents Hero'. The film, ultimately, is a remake, so how do you critique it? I guess the best way is try not to compare the two films and access how well this film works on its own. Of course that is impossible to do but I went in being as fair as I could to The Departed.The film was really well made. The acting good; Jack Nicholson is insane but he got the part down and is very memorable in giving us another villain. He hasn't played one in a while. I had heard about the dildo story in the theater scene but I did not expect to see it. Leonardo Dicarprio was spot on but it seemed from the script he took a more conventional approach to playing an undercover agent (one who was intensely stressed, anxious and swearing). Tony Leung's performance in IA had a wider dynamic as you see more aspects of his character besides him on his job. Tony Leung has said himself he approached playing the role of Yan of being a very optimistic person as that is the only way (and a fresh way) he can imagine someone can get through being an undercover agent. That is not Dicarprio though. Matt Damon played his role subtly. Mark Walhberg's role as a chronically verbal abusing cop was pretty entertaining and seemed like he had fun playing a role like that. Something really worth mentioning is the editing; it is very scrambled and you jump quickly btw past and present but it all seems to work because it makes sense.The following is what three points that I did not like about the film that makes the entire story weaker, which weakened the ending. So the following would contain spoilers. Do not read beyond this point if you haven't seen the film. Those who don't care, proceed. 1) The role or function of SP Wong in IA has been divided into three characters in this film. The importance of SP Wong in the original film was that he was the only one who know Yan's (Tony Leung's) identitiy. His death was crucial because of this. In this film, you have two character that know the identity of Leonardo Dicarprio's character. One dies falling off the roof, ala SP Wong, but the other survives and disappears till the end of the film. This weakens the protagonist's conflict. At the end, when Damon deletes DiCarprio's identity on the computer, there remains 2 characters (Anthony Anderson and Mark Wahlberg) who are still alive who know DiCarprio's true identity. 2) The two female interests in the first film is reduced to one female interest. The psychiatrist role dates the mob mole and has the cop mole as a patient. This does not harm the film, but deviates and changes the Matt Damon role majorly. In the original, Andy Lau's wife plays a role into his character wanting to be good and hence pushes him to kill the crime boss. Matt Damon's character is not tortured as Andy Lau's character was in the original IA. In TD, Matt Damon kills Jack Nicholson because he's been informed that Jack Nicholson has been exposing his identity as a mob mole to the FBI; which was a very weak reason for their final confrontation. Dicarprio's storyline is less significant but in IA having Kelly Chen had added another dimension to his Tony Leung's character. 3) They replace morse code with text messaging. Matt Damon hides his cellphone in his pocket and types cellphone messages. I do not know why they had to do this. I liked the finger tapping, it seems more feasible as it is more stealthy and in the IA sequels it remained as a motif for sanity/insanity. This change just seemed arbritary. But no biggie.To conclude, I was really engaged by this film and I was in the presence of good film-making. I just think the changes hurt the ending to the film. Nonetheless, the film will entertain you.",7,0,1,8 October 2006
12 Years a Slave," HK Auteur film review - 12 Years A Slave
","Based on the memoirs of Solomon Northup, it recounts the story of Northup, a free black carpenter and musician living in upstate New York, who gets kidnapped and illegally sold as a slave to the south for twelve years.Solomon Northup is the role of a lifetime and Chiwitel Ejiofor delivers it in full, leaving the viewer in moments of shock, fear and awe. Solomon's inner conflict between resisting his new slave identity to the sad eventual acceptance is all communicated through Ejiofor's face and body, as he is forbidden to speak. And it is in witness of terrible things, we see Solomon grasping tight onto his own values and dignity that makes his situation all the more endearing. It is impressive how we can see what Ejiofor is thinking in every moment. There is noteworthy long take where Solomon quietly contemplates his own fate, his eyes slowly look towards the camera and it struck me dead still. Even though Matthew McConaughey is still my pick for the Oscar this year, it's going to be ultimately between McConaughey and Chiwitel Ejiofor. Michael Fassbender's Edwin Epps is one of the most despicable evil on screen characters in recent memory and probably for the ages. Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Sarah Paulson and Benedict Cumberbatch all give fine supporting performances. What dark nether place the Caucasian actors are going mentally to breathe life into playing slavers is unfathomable. It is quite a sight to behold that level of evil being performed.As producer, Brad Pitt didactically shows up in a small part to say the entire point of the story. While good in the part, Pitt's appearance seems for more political reasons than purely for story reasons. It is not big enough of a problem to say he is miscast, but some may find it hokey or jarring. Newcomer Lupita Nyong'o is spectacular as Epp's most prized slave Patsy, capable of picking five hundred pounds of cotton per day, but the achievement brings her more harm than relief. What happens to Patsy is even more heartbreaking than Solomon's situation. Because of this, Nyong'o becomes the heart of the story in the latter half, as she represents the majority of slaves who were never free to begin with and never will be. Nyong'o is my pick for the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. The physical violence is hard to watch. However, the non-violent scenes offer an insight not prevalent in other slave films, answering Quentin Tarantino's proposed question 'Why don't slaves just kill their masters and escape in the middle of the night?' from Django Unchained. Steve McQueen gets beneath of how slavery works psychologically and shows its emotional violence. The way the slaves are sold posed completely naked, shower in groups outdoors like animals, and dance and sing in the middle of the night to amuse their masters, the power of slavery is not the threat of the whip but the overwhelming sense of human degradation that weighs them to the eventual surrender of one's humanity.Needless to say, 12 Years A Slave is an intense and upsetting experience. The story is masterfully visualized by McQueen, showing the horror of slavery through how society deemed it normal and acceptable. The awards recognition it has gained is well deserved and has nothing to do with the fact that it is a film about slavery or playing to the white guilt in Oscar voters. The majority of audiences will probably only be able to stomach the experience once, as the gut-wrenching nature of it may not be friendly to watching it again. My suggestion: go see it once, but see it in full with your eyes wide open and soak it all in for what it is. It is a work of social and historical significance.",9,0,2,14 February 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," HK Auteur film review - The Wolf of Wall Street
","Martin Scorsese's latest is based on the memoirs of Jordan Belfort, a New York stockbroker and founder of Stratton Oakmont, a company which engaged in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street during the nineties. First off, the performances are top-notch. Leonardo DiCaprio has managed to find new depths by playing a character that is even debatably worse than the racist plantation owner in Django Unchained. DiCaprio has done more than enough to win his Oscar, and winning for The Wolf of Wall Street is as good any of his other roles. My favorite DiCaprio performance is still Howard Hughes in The Aviator. Though my vote goes to McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club this year. Speaking of which, McConaughey has a great cameo as Jordan's mentor, who gives Belfort the inspirational push. However, Jonah Hill is the standout as Belfort's psychotic sidekick Donnie Azoff, delivering an even more impressive performance than in Moneyball.At a 3-hour running time, the film is too long and it easily could have been shorter with less party scenes and throwing midgets into giant dartboards at the office. As a rise-and-fall story, it has too much 'rise' and not enough 'fall'. I wanted the story to move on and inform us about the financial damage this all caused and all the lives it hurt in the process, but Scorsese does not seem interested in the forensics. Overall there are some very good party set pieces and funny scenes, but after a while, I was just numb.The story is essentially told from the villain's point of view. Extending this idea to the classic children's storybook The True Story of the Three Little Pigs, which is told from the Big Bad Wolf's perspective. The Wolf retells the Three Little Pigs story and asks the reader to consider his side of the story. The Wolf was simply trying to bake a cake for his grandmother's birthday while nursing a bad cold, and things got out of hand. Therein lies my criticism: there is nothing redeemable from the Jordan Belfort character in The Wolf of Wall Street. Or at the very least, the filmmakers do not seem interested in showing anything beyond the surface. The breaking-the-4th-wall story device of having the villain narrate his story to the audience is raunchy and creative, but Scorsese totally forgets that it is supposed to be ironical. The premise of the black comedy is that we're supposed to laugh at how vile and putrid these people are. But by the nth orgy scene, the characters are matted into two dimensions and we never get beneath the surface. The morality play tips over to the other side and it mistakenly justifies itself. Just because this a tale about self-indulgent shallow people doesn't mean we have to tell their story in a self-indulgent shallow fashion.The bad taste left in my mouth at the end is not the film's self-indulgence, but out of worry that The Wolf of Wall Street is so unclear about its cautionary message, that there are certain viewers that will admire this lifestyle and become inspired to become a stock broker. For the rest of that find the Belfort character repugnant will feel empty wondering what justified the three-hour running time.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",7,7,12,26 January 2014
The Conjuring," HK Auteur Review - The Conjuring
","Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren work to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse.The fact that The Conjuring is based on a true story is competently incorporated into the film's design. James Wan takes his time with his world creation and properly sets up a believable reality. These characters act like real people. Most people wouldn't be quick to jump to the conclusion that their house is haunted and it would realistically take a while for a family to seek help. I couldn't spot anybody making stupid horror movie mistakes. The initial scares did not scare me, but step-by-step the scares put me into the world. As I understood the science and how these ghosts worked, my mental defenses begun to weaken and I began dreading the scares.Wan uses every trick in the book for the scares, but they are effectively scary. Judging it from a pure horror film fan's view, the design of the scares by themselves are probably not that fresh. But it's genetically encoded together with the story in such a way that if you were to show one of the film's scary sequences on Youtube to a friend, the actual scare will be dampened without the context of the story.The best thing The Conjuring achieves is that it properly balances the horror movie genre elements with its dramatic portions. It does so by focusing on Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are fascinating larger-than-life characters and are the heart of the story. Watching the paranormal investigators set up their ghost hunting equipment and explaining how ghosts behave was equally entertaining as any of the film's fright sequences. Where in a typical horror movie that will rely on its scares to entertain the audience, The Conjuring has an interesting real-life story and characters that we can not only be scared by, but also speculate and ponder long after the scares are over. The Warrens are the X factor what will unite horror film fans and a typical movie goer to enjoying this movie on multiple levels. I immediately Googled the Warrens after seeing the film and read about their other real-life paranormal investigations. I am glad the studio has decided to make a sequel with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga playing these characters again.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8,0,2,1 September 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," HK Auteur film review - Saving Mr. Banks
","As a writer, it is my opinion that how authors view the film adaptation of their own work is irrelevant and inconsequential to the quality of the adaptation itself. For example, whether Stephen King appreciates Stanley Kubrick's The Shining fundamentally does not make it a lesser film. This is the central question presented in John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks. The story recounts Author P.L. Travers (Mary Poppins), writer of Mary Poppins, reluctantly meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who seeks to adapt her book for the big screen. As they are collaborating on the film adaptation, Travers reflects on her childhood growing up in Australia with her father (Colin Farrell), revealing her own personal attachments to the Mary Poppins story. Emma Thompson breathes a great inner life into P.L. Travers, humanizing a role that is greatly restrained and otherwise very unlikable. Tom Hanks, combining his star persona and natural ease, gives us a living and breathing Walt Disney. Hanks makes everything look so easy. Colin Farrell turns an affecting performance as Travers' chronic alcoholic father Travers Goff, and also props to Annie Rose Buckley as the young P.L. Travers. The heart of the story lies in the flashback segments, as we see P.L. Travers' past with his father in Australia and it shows that P.L. Travers essentially wrote Mary Poppins as wish fulfillment.Director John Lee Hancock balances the material perfectly. Even though I fundamentally disagree with Travers' persnickety demand of complete faithfulness, I empathize deeply with why she was so overprotective of her own material. It makes for much of the laughs as we watch the gloom Travers single-handedly killing all the child-like enthusiasm of the staff at Disney. It is probably best to see Mary Poppins first to get a more wholesome experience, as seeing the numerous classic scenes and songs that Travers could have prevented from ever being created gives a whole other level of tension. Also, stay for the credits for a surprise easter egg. Despite probably being overshadowed in terms of awards recognition, Saving Mr. Banks is a very enjoyable experience. Audience will find laughs and tears, as it is a well-made feel good movie.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",7,0,1,25 February 2014
Thor: The Dark World," HK Auteur Review - Thor: The Dark World
","Thor: The Dark World properly continues the story after The Avengers (sorry, Iron Man 3) and Thor. It retains the things that I liked about the first installment without repeating them. The plot moves fast and it's intense. Things never gets too grim and has a genuine sense of adventure and awe. Dry witty humor is used again effectively to balance out the ridiculousness of Norse gods walking amongst humans. The fights look tough and grueling, more so than in The Avengers. Partly because everybody's physically melee fighting and the Dark Elves are actually physically challenging to Thor and the Asgardians.The Nine Realms are explored more thoroughly and the audience gets to spend more time on Asgard, which is a much more interesting place to be than Earth. The designs and world creation are impressive, particularly in the disaster sequences. It shows how brilliant an idea it was in the first film to imply that magic is unexplainable science, thereby combining and justifying both.Chris Hemsworth owns the role of Thor with his presence. Thor is a character whose depths are only shown when interacting with other characters, which is that served as a disadvantage in The Avengers. In his own movie, there's an immense cast to give him that depth. I liked his arc in this story. Natalie Portman gets to be the fish out of water this time around and it's an entertaining reversal.Tom Hiddleston again oozes charm as Loki. It's a great actor relishing a great part. He plays the audience like an instrument as we intermittently love and hate him. The writers put a lot of work in designing the twists and turns in Loki's infinite mind games, truly earning the character the title of 'God of Mischief'. Loki fooled me again and again throughout and I kept wanting to trust him.The Warriors Three gets wrecked a bit. It seemed like there was some scheduling problem in which Tabanobu Asano's Hogun had to be reduced. Also, I prefer the Joshua Dallas as Fandral, who had to be replaced by Zachary Levi from Chuck. Levi by comparison seems to struggle channeling Errol Flynn. Both cases are unfortunate.The new villain Malekith played by Christopher Eccleston is buried under a lot of Dark Elf make-up and speaking an alien language in his own scenes, which removes any chance of proper scenery chewing. His presence as a villain is ultimately functional on par with Hugo Weaving's Red Skull. Malekith exists for the main characters to grow and there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it is noteworthy. Marvel seems to be ensuring that their villains never are more interesting than their heroes. The heart of the story is still the central relationship between Thor and Loki. In fact, it's probably the most interesting relationship in the current Marvel cinematic universe. Director Alan Taylor knows this and competently moves their story forward.The numerous Stan Lee cameos is starting to get creepy because it means there are a growing amount of Stan Lee lookalike clones in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And is it me or has Anthony Hopkins been playing the majority of his roles like a Norse god all this time? I am just kidding.Depending where Captain America: Winter Soldier goes with Captain America's story, I wonder how many more solo movies Marvel actually needs to plan out. It doesn't look like they're planning any solo Hulk films and Iron Man seems to be up in the air right now. Who knows how Guardians of the Galaxy is going to turn out. But they can really just start doing more Avengers movies at this point. That said, I do want to see what happens with Thor and Loki in a third installment. Actually, a third Thor is very necessary.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8,0,10,5 November 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Hk Auteur Review - Moonrise Kingdom
","A pair of young lovers flee their New England town, which causes a local search party to fan out and find them.The film has a strong ensemble cast. The two leads Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward carry the film just fine. I believed their romance, connected with their loneliness and rooted for them. It's been a while since Bruce Willis played a character. In America they call it character acting; the rest of the world just calls it acting. Don't ask me why. But it was refreshing to see Willis play someone who functions at a lower volume compared to his larger-than-life tough guy action roles. It was also nice to see Edward Norton doing comedy and playing a klutzier character as well.Perhaps my favorite thing about Moonrise Kingdom was its storybook aesthetic, which acts as the engine pumping a vibrant energy through the story. To list a few examples, the story is set in an enclosed world. A narrator delivers story information straight to the camera in a vocal tone that sounds like he's instructing a child on how to use a toaster. The cinematography, with its camera movements, deliberately flattens the framing, subtly embodying the two-dimensional quality of a children's storybook panel.I liked the world that was created in the film. It was believable and at the same time contained a fairy-tale-like quality and a sense of wonder. As the two lead characters were trying to escape their home like a cartoon character trying to run out of the edges of a page, I could not have imagined what the outside world would have looked like. The world was just that well established. For example, product placement would have completely shattered the illusion of the world. Not that I was specifically looking for it, but I'm glad I do not recall any in the film.There is a real sense of a community that's attached to this place and I like that even the smaller characters all contribute to the action of the story rather than acting as mere background decoration. And for that, the characters earn their quirks.The only other Wes Anderson work I have seen was The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. So I maybe unqualified to say this, but Moonrise Kingdom is probably the most accessible Wes Anderson film. The film is rated PG-13, but I do believe that the film will play well to children (from 9-10 onwards, it does have a few dark moments), particularly as a way to reach children who have been orphaned or have experienced a broken family. It feels as though Wes Anderson made this movie for them.I was entranced, laughed and it put me in a fuzzy warm mood by the end. Moonrise Kingdom proves how simple stories can still be powerful and it does not take complex story structures to engage and move an audience.
