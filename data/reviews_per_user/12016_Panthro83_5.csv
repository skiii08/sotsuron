Lucky Number Slevin," In one word, Good.
","If you're looking for depth, or surprises, this may not live up to its billing. However, not to shoot it down too fast, I found this an enjoyable and entertaining film, with some good performances in an unexceptional script.Full of twists and turns, you'd expect to be kept guessing right to the end, but aside from perhaps some more minor details, most will have it figured out well before the ending sequences.Overall though, it was a fun film, with plenty of good lines, especially between josh hartnett and lucy liu, who brightened up the film no end.I'd recommend it as a good film if you don't want anything taxing, just want something to sit back and enjoy. You never know, you might just like it.",7,1,7,28 March 2006
Hostel," A film that makes you ask Why?
","I got this film on a recommendation, and given that I enjoy horror films in general, I thought I'd rent it and see what I thought.From the outset I was just waiting for the main characters to get killed off, they were bland and banal, and for the first 40-50 minutes the only enjoyment you're likely to get from this film is the several shots of pretty girls, and several of them naked.When the plot actually kicks in, the idea is at first laughable, as these three friends wander off to eastern Europe to find the fabled hostel. What follows I suppose is intended to be shocking, but the set-up is so horrendous that I was waiting for some sort of twist or extra dimension to rescue this film which was already circling the drain.What follows mixes a few stereotypes in with some slightly substandard special effects, and finishes it off with such disdain that you wonder if the screenplay was written in an afternoon.I'm unsure of the intended target demographic of this film, given that it would have appealed more to me if I had been around 14-15, although as far as I'm aware its an 18 certificate.And as for Tarantino, I truly wonder if he has lost the plot a little, and it puts me off watching his future work if he was so ready to plaster his name over this half-baked project.Avoid this if you can, there's a huge range of better films out there.",4,1,2,29 September 2007
Silent Hill," An advertisement against films based on games...
","As a fan of horror films, I rented this title expecting at the very least an enjoyable ride, like resident evil, or perhaps some sort of creepy hidden mystery.I feel I should point out that I have never played silent hill, though I had seen a few screenshots and so forth, so the plot ideas should have been new and fresh to me. Unfortunately this was not the case, as the film seemed to spend a long time posing, and perhaps trying to please those that had played silent hill. Perhaps with that background, I could have found it endearing, but instead, to me, it fell flat on its face.The bulk of the plot was fairly standard, and the acting was mediocre at best, with an amusing turn by the usually strong Sean Bean as the father with an outrageous American accent. Would it have been so bad to have let him speak normally? Would it be so off-the-wall to have a British businessman as the father, instead of an American? or perhaps just hired an American actor, for what was a relatively small role anyway.And finally, the reveal at the end, the part you were waiting for for so long, was a bit of a damp squib, fleshed out quite badly in a full-on recap and flashbacks which were very unnecessary.Not the worst film I've seen, but it certainly had a good attempt.",4,1,3,29 September 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Some scenes may not be suitable for anyone
","I gave this the benefit of the doubt, going to see it despite being disappointed by most modern horror films. This one seemingly had an identity crisis, trying to be everything to everyone, and ending up satisfying only those who were after blood and gore, as well as some unnecessary depravity.As others have mentioned, there are plenty of films that contain parts of this, but done in a better way. Deliverance beats it hands down for suspense and the whole redneck angle. The original Texas chainsaw massacre beats it on a slasher/bloodfest score.The script showed a lack of inventiveness and intelligence, especially when recreating an original film. The dialogue was poor all round, and the ending was bland.Surely if you had multiple tyre blow-outs you might think something was wrong? and why go down a dirt road when you have barely and idea where you are? There were also some unanswered questions, perhaps cut from the final film.When one of the family sees the stolen goods in the gas station, she does nothing, not even uttering a single word about it. Surely you couldn't trust this man's directions? The mutants supposedly survived in the mines for many (dozens of?) years, yet came out to live in the mock village afterwards? Three things they could have done to improve the film if only slightly: one: the beauty and the beast thing would perhaps have added a little if it had been beauty that had gone on the killer rampage, as opposed to the more aptly named beast. (Not that the names we'rent incredibly irritating anyway...) two: at the end, the gas station attendant could be directing another set of brainless people down towards the mutants.three: Just not bothered remaking it at all...",4,1,2,28 March 2006
North by Northwest," Cinematic Gold
","If only all films could be as rewarding to watch as this, I was hooked from start to finish, and would definitely not hesitate in watching it again.This is one of those films that has it all, intricate and well formed plot, likable main character superbly played by Cary grant, and a magnificent all round cast.The chase of Thornhill from place to place, as he in turn is chasing the man he's been mistaken for, keeps you occupied and attentive, waiting for each new problem, new twist in the tale that arrives as Thornhill proceeds.The direction and settings for each scene were sublime, including a fantastic piece of camera work when grant's character gets dropped off in the middle of nowhere by bus to meet the elusive George kaplan. The shot begins with him getting off the bus, and switches to a wide view of the emptiness and bleakness of his current surrounds, as the bus pulls out of view. Then it switches to grant, with the road running next to him, into the distance. The versatility of the direction and camera-work is something sometimes lacking from films, and certainly stands out in this one.The locations were perfectly chosen, from the UN building in new york, to mount Rushmore for the climax. The grandeur of the background only serves to enhance the experience.As far as favourite scenes go, I'd have to go for the dining car on the train, with the banter showing the attraction between thornhill and Kendall, or perhaps the auction room scene, an inspired way to evade capture by thornhill's pursuers.Apart from me being a film geek, north by northwest gives you a fulfilling ride through the frustrations and experiences of Thornhill as he is mistaken for a spy. Wit and humour pepper the dialogue, making you laugh and smile, with Cary grants rough charm accentuating everything.Surely as close to film perfection as it gets. A must see.",10,2,3,29 March 2006
