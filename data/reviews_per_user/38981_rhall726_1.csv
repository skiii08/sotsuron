Sucker Punch," Fantastic...A must see
","This movie was just fantastic. It may not seem like it's good, but do not believe the critics. This is a 100% fantastic all the way through for most moviegoers. Do you want a emotional story? Check. Just want to see some bad ass action girls kill monsters? Check. Do you want a thought provoking make you think kind of movie? Check. In literally the first 30 seconds to a minute, i was already hit emotionally. I don't know why(but i can take a guess what set me off), The first scene got to me in a way no other film has. And it held me there. This movie was just so good, ANY movie aficionado, steam punk fan, action movie fan, deep emotional story lovers, this movie is a MUST SEE.",10,1,3,12 August 2012
