Casablanca," the best film ever
","In my opinion, this is the best film ever. Great dialogue, great actors, wonderful filming, laughs and tears, there is something in this film for everyone. Although it was filmed in 1942, this film doesn't age, and is just as good, however many times you watch it.",10,1,2,23 January 2003
