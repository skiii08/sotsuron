The Devil's Advocate," surprisingly good
","I love this movie. I like the fact that its not preachy, its not a morality tale, and its not one of those annoying 'god vs. the devil' type of movies. Its basically about the devil and his perspective. I love Al Pacino as the wicked devil and Keanu actually acts well in this movie. I especially loved the ending. Its a damn good movie.I'm sure not everyone will love it but I definitely do. I don't think every movie needs to end with a morality tale, I think its great that the movie had fun with the myth of Satan. I love that the movie keeps you guessing towards the end, not everything is tied up with a pretty ribbon and yet the movie isn't depressing either. I was surprised. I'd watch it again.",Null,0,1,21 December 2008
L.A. Confidential," boring
","I didn't even wait until the movie was over. I took it out in the middle. This movie is boring and filled with tripe. I love Russell Crowe but not in this movie. I know it won a lot of awards but ugh I just couldn't take it. The plot is so boring. I hate the old school look, I know its set in the 1940s/1950s or whatever and because its old, I just couldn't relate to it and sit through it.I don't like Kevin Spacey and the tall old guy either. Kevin Spacey is so boring. He has no charisma. He always acts the same in every movie too. I don't even know why he even made this movie. Why Hollywood made this movie? Its so horrible, and boring. I thought I would die of boredom towards the end.",Null,1,11,17 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," cute but only for fantasy nerds
",I know they wanted to tell this great epic of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy but I just felt like they could have made it into one movie instead of making three long movies. I think this movie is more for the fans. Yes its great that the director took the fantasy books seriously but frankly it just didn't do it for me.I tried reading LOTR and couldn't get into the books either. I think you must really either love fantasy or love fantasy and be a fan of the books. I think hobbits are weird. Maybe its just me but yea they're weird. Overall I feel like the LOTR movies are for nerds just like the Star Wars movies are for nerds. I'm not even going to bother watching the other two in the trilogy.,Null,0,0,6 November 2008
Wanted," its hot
","I love this movie. This is a major spoiler but I thought the whole 'loom of fate' bit was ridiculous. That was a major plot hole. Where did the loom come from? What is this fate thing that is running it? Why would fate get involved in the lives of mortals? Why does fate care so much about having a balance in the universe? So there was no logic in it. Also it seemed silly to take orders from a loom. It would have been better if they had just left the whole loom bit out. Overall its a great action movie, it has Angelina Jolie in it and she's great. I like that he left his snarky and horrible girlfriend, she was really annoying and I love how he quit his job. hehe.",Null,1,1,16 December 2008
Gone with the Wind," its okay
","I used to love this movie but not anymore. Scarlett is ridiculous, pining over a guy that is already taken. She's just sad and desperate and pathetic. Also I don't get how Melanie is so naive and stupid about Scarlett. When Scarlett finds out that she can't finally stand Ashley, she loses the one guy (Rhett) who loved her. Even at her worst, even when she was unlovable, he still loved her and tried to understand her and tried to help her and be loyal to her.But I really don't respect Melanie. She just acts like an idiot. The acting by everyone is so melodramatic. Also Ashley is annoying. He's a wimp and a coward. I don't get why Scarlett married guys she didn't love and that she couldn't stand. I like the theme song. I think if they ever remake this movie then they should make the characters less ridiculous. I never want to watch this movie ever again.",Null,2,7,10 November 2008
Twilight," cool flick
","I haven't read the books before seeing it on Thanksgiving. Yes I'm one of those people who goes to the theatres during the holidays. Anyway, I decided to see it on a whim and liked it. I am not obsessed with it like some people are. I've never been like that. I will admit that some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy.I felt some of the romance parts were rushed like when Edward said that Bella was his life now. That's a little intense, especially when Bella is in her late teens and is just introduced to the vampires. Bella doesn't act like a normal person would act to a vampire. She wants to be with Edward but doesn't really take into consideration what a life with Edward might mean.I also have another question. What does Bella want, besides a life with Edward? In the movies, I like it when heroines have their own strengths, their own passions. At least in LOTR, Arwen had her own strengths as an elf princess and I don't even like LOTR. In chick flicks, the leading women have their own passions as well.Bella doesn't seem to have many interests. She also ditches her friends in school for Edward all the time and I don't really like it in the movies when characters are total loners. You need at least a couple of friends in life besides your SO. I would have liked her character to have been more developed.So its a cool movie with its flaws, but I don't get the obsession with it. I'm in my twenties, but even when I was a teen, I never got obsessed with things. I'm not knocking love either, love is important, but so is being able to be a happy person with or without someone.",Null,1,3,30 November 2008
Titanic," decent but too long
","I hate how this movie starts off, the first 20 minutes are boring with the crew looking into the old ship. Even when you're telling a great story through film, 3 hours is just too long. I don't get why she threw the necklace into the ocean. Also its hard to understand why anyone would be impressed by a ship. Its just weird and why people would think a man-made ship couldn't be unsinkable. That's just gullible and that's not the movie, people actually thought the Titanic couldn't sink. Still, three hours? I could watch two different movies within that time span. Overall its a decent movie, and a fun disaster film and yes while I do have my complaints, I do believe its a worthwhile movie overall. I would definitely own it on DVD.",Null,0,2,20 December 2008
It's a Wonderful Life," why its not a classic to me
","So the premise is that one person's life affects dozens of people, far more than we could ever imagine and that all of us have value and purpose, and there are some religious aspects thrown in. I do agree that we affect people even when we don't think we do and even when we don't even want to.I used to love this movie as a kid but I don't love it anymore as an adult. I don't respect George anymore because in my honest opinion, I think there should be a balance between helping other people and following your dreams. Making yourself a martyr at the cost of your life is not altruistic. At least not to me.Also the movie seems to imply that if the right people don't show up to encourage people that people will give up. Like George is shown that Mary would have become a spinster without him being born. I believe that we should always be our best friends, because someone can't always be there to encourage us.We really carry ourselves through life even though we may have family and friends in our lives, but we really do carry ourselves through life and we just can't give up on ourselves and our own lives just because the right person didn't show up to encourage us. Its great when others encourage us but all of us have been through horrible periods in our lives when no one was there.Sometimes you have to be your own best friend. I don't believe that another human can be everyone's martyr and they show that its okay with the character of George Bailey. Sure its wonderful to help people but to be a martyr? I don't think so. No way. Also its implied that rich people are evil.Why couldn't they have shown another rich person that was nice and decent, to balance out the point of view? Its not wrong to want to be wealthy and a lot of wealthy people contribute to charities. I mean look at Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, and others like them. The wealthy contribute far more to charities than any income bracket. Not all of them are evil. There are good wealthy people too.",Null,5,18,10 November 2008
