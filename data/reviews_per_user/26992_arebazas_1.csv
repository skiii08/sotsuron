Hereditary," Great movie. Amazingly acted by everyone.
",Is such a great story and very creepy. I found it more sinister than scary which is better in my opinion. The only thing I would have liked it to be shorter. 30 minutes less would have been perfect. Since it does drag a bit. But still a masterpiece,9,42,90,1 June 2018
