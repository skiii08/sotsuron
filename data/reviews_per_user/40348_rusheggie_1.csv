Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a travesty
","'A special effect without a story is pretty boring thing'. George Lucas said that. Something happened to Lucas sometime between 1977 and 1999. (I personally think it was soon after 1977.) Absolute power corrupts absolutely.Anyway, this movie is a special effect without a story. Sadly, this is also the best thing about the movie. The costumes and make-up are pretty interesting, not much else positive can really be said.And why do people use computer graphics? They look horrible. When effects in movies from decades prior look more convincing something has clearly gone wrong.There is no way that this film deserves a rating as high as a six on IMDb.",1,5,10,10 July 2012
