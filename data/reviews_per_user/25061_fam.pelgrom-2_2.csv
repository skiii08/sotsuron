Antz," Dreamworks rises
","Who says Disney is the only good animator? Move in Dreamworks. Antz was released ahead of schedule to beat Disney's 'A Bug's Life' to it. I have not seen 'A Bug's Life' at this point so I will refrain from making a comment about it.I will comment about 'Antz', because it cracked me up. That movie was so funny. The animations are good to. Maybe not as good as Disney's but they get by.Worth the mention are the vocal talents of Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman & Jennifer Lopez. They make this movie come alive.You want to see a good animated feature? Get this one, now!",8,2,2,23 June 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hot fun, smooth songs
","South Park belongs to those who love it. Many people don't. That's their problem. I love it, so I will write a positive remark.The episodes are great, but the movie is better. Stone and Parker saved the best jokes for the film and it has an intelligent storyline too. Basically the film makes fun of itself. The whole thing about violence and cursing being bad for young children is depicted beautifully. Problem with South Park is that after an episode of 20 minutes you're bound to have enough. That is why they made a number of beautiful songs to break the tension and liven things up. That is what makes this movie so great. And get a load of the special effects. They're amazing. Whoah!",9,0,0,23 June 2000
