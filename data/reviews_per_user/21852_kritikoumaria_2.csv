Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Best Movie EVER!!!
","Kill Bill vol.1 and vol.2 are definitely the best movies(duology) in cinema history. It contains a lot of emotion, agony, thrill, melancholy and feeling of justice and vengeance. It is definitely the best fighting movie ever. Ennio Morricone soundtracks were perfect. I admire Robert Rodriguez and RZA a lot. Itis the first time Tarantino uses Morricone music, children to play in the movie,katana swords. I loved the idea of using sword. It is actually a film with a lot of martial arts, chapters, revenge, violence & love and it has no sex scenes which is very important for the movie. The Bride is not a woman for sex. She is a warrior who wants to take her daughter back.The end scene creates a feeling of justice.Definitely, best movie.",10,4,8,5 February 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Best movie in cinema history!
","It reminded me a bit of Lord Of The Rings, Pulp Fiction and Death Rides A Horse. The best dramatic Tarantino's feminist Kung Fu movie. Also, i loved the cast and the characters, i did not expected Uma Thurman to be such a good actress. She only plays in boring movies with forgettable roles. This time, no. I loved his technique with blood and also i liked the whole case with Pai Mei and Elle. Sometimes, Vol.2 reminded me Karate Kid and also i wanna thank Robert Rodriguez and RZA for Morricone's-and not only-music. I also loved Daryl Hannah villain character and Lucy Liu. He used actors they were really forgotten, like Carradine, Gordon Liu, Hannah etc...",10,2,5,5 December 2016
