Skyfall," An enjoyable film but not a James Bond film.
","Don't get me wrong, I liked this film. In fact I enjoyed watching the film. But somehow it didn't feel right. Even the mediocrities of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace gave off similar vibes to all the other James Bond films we know: the charm, elegance and fun that is the taste of a James Bond movie. However, this film did not feel like this. It did not feel like a James Bond movie. So here we go with a straightforward plot about ex- agent Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) back with a grudge against M (Judi Dench) who cut him loose when he was going about some unauthorised hacking and was captured by the Chinese.There has been a recent trend in big film series that the sequels continue to get darker and darker, as can be found in the likes of Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and the Dark Knight trilogy. This happens also in Skyfall, and although making such films darker can often make films more successful, this simply does not work with James Bond. The uncharismatic role Daniel Craig plays as James Bond does not help with this. In the films (and the novels), James Bond has always been full of charisma, charming and full of witty remarks. Although many of the films have incorporated real-life situations in their plots (such as the Cold War), there have been few that have been too serious (The Spy Who Loved Me, Diamonds are Forever, Live and Let Die). To his credit, he manages to pull a couple off here, but they are very few and far between. Although it was entertaining, it did not seem reminiscent of the others.Unfortunately, although the plot was quite different to what we've experienced in the past, the film itself was quite one-dimensional – the only major plot line was Silva's vendetta against M. That's it. One plot. Few (in fact, one) subplots. It starts off well. Silva is threatening to release all the names of operatives implanted in terrorist organisations of the world. That sounded really interesting. However, everybody forgot that it existed as they dropped it halfway through the film so Silva could pursue M. This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. If you are going to create a plot device, it should be followed through, not binned and hope that nobody realises. So they had to fill in the rest of the film with tons of action sequences (everybody enjoys a bit of mindless action, but that was too much) and by bringing Bond's family into the story was little more than plot-filler, for what could have been a very short film. This subplot (the only subplot actually) could have easily been placed in any other Bond film as it serves no function to the overall plot whatsoever.Most notably, Skyfall has the biggest anti-climax I have seen for a long, long time. All 3 of Daniel Craig's Bond films have ended in a huge anti-climax which has always made the film a huge letdown. There are no henchmen, or 'second-in-commands' to speak of in these recent films, and every major villain has posed little match for Bond. The past 3 films, one was shot unceremoniously by another terrorist, another flailed around with an axe for 15 seconds before being easily disarmed, and now, the villain, Raoul Silva, who was one of the best Bond villains we have seen in a long time – gets a knife in the back. He did not deserve to die in such an abrupt manner, like any one of the grunts James Bond ploughs through each film. It's insulting. Although elements from previous films such as Q, the Aston Martin and Moneypenny were welcome in Skyfall, often they served little function in the film whatsoever but to amass nostalgic favour from long-time James Bond fans. I really think the change to Britain as the backdrop for most of the scenes in the film was very refreshing and enjoyable – the exotic landscapes of far abroad places are not missed in this film. The UK has plenty of natural beauty to showcase itself, and it was nice to see some of that. New additions to the cast like Mallory and Moneypenny I am sure will keep the series afresh for many films to come and made noticeable impacts in Skyfall.As the 23rd film of a series, this film could not relate in any way whatsoever to the previous films. Its plot is one-dimensional and makes little sense in many parts. However, if you were to consider this film individually from the rest of the series, and could ignore the awful ending, it was a decent film.",7,4,7,6 February 2014
Gravity," Gravity. It gets you down. This film certainly does.
","This film is not even worthy of a review, but in protest to yet another railroaded Oscars, I have been compelled enough to write this, to warn people about the dreariness of Gravity, and voice my incredulity how this undeserving film ever got a rating of 8.2. NONPLUSSED is probably the best way to describe how I feel about Gravity, and not I a good way.Taking on the 'stellar' reviews this film has had, I decided to go and see what all the hype was for myself. It now has the unremarkable accolade of being one of the very few films I have ever walked out on in my life. People complain about this film being scientifically inaccurate, but that is besides the point. This film is boring. BORING. Nothing remotely interesting, surprising or thrilling happened at all. Chomping your way through a loaf of plain brown bread is less tedious than this. It is just George Clooney and Sandra Bullock as two astronauts floating in space while being battered by debris storms that they can precisely predict when they are going to happen. Not only is this film tedious, they want to sap away any sense of suspense too. George got bored halfway in and decided to leave, and I took his example, and ejected myself from the theatre too soon after. Sandra reading an instruction manual from a foreign abandoned space station with no effort was the last straw for me.This film left me fuming. Not only was I angry that I had wasted an hour of my life before I saw this film for what is was (garbage), But also I knew that this film would shoot to fame and ubiquity. Gravity does not even deserve 1 star. It probably doesn't even deserve 0. How this excuse for entertainment, how this Gravity has shot to critical acclaim and won a handful of Oscars is completely beyond me. Then again, if a film only has 1 or 2 actors in it throughout the majority of the film, it is automatically and mindlessly showered with praise and awards - see The Life of Pi, 127 Hours and other similar trash. Everything about it is terrible. It doesn't deserve a single minute of your time. At least they were actually bearable enough for me to make it to the end.The list of dubious winners of Oscars from previous years is endless, but even they are better, and that really is saying something. Unfortunately, this year, the Awards have been disgraced by this detritus. I cannot say how indescribably cheated and annoyed I feel about this film. And nonplussed. I just hope you have the sense to give up on it long before I did.",1,3,7,4 March 2014
The Way Back," A beautifully shot film
","An enjoyable film of survival following the miserable days of escapees from the Siberian gulags in the Second World War. The unfortunate group have to brave the elements at their very extremes on their harsh trip to India - the harshest blizzards of the Siberian tundra to the blistering heat of the Mongolian desert are only a few of the torments the group must endure. Acting veterans Ed Harris, Colin Farrell and Jim Sturgess do not disappoint, as well as Mark Strong (although I think he could have had a bigger role) and the talented young actress Saoirse Ronan pulls out a commanding performance that is impossible to miss.The cinematography in this film is breathtaking. The panoramic shots of the Mongolian steppe and Lake Baikal are beautiful. This film gives us an amazing tour of some of the world's less well known scenery but no less stunning, as well as giving a gripping story to view.The criticism I have is that the scriptwriters could have been a lot more creative with the challenges the escapees face, all of whichever were pretty generic. I think they missed an opportunity here, but I guess the film is supposedly based on a true story (although there has been a lot of doubt cast on its authenticity). An enjoyable film nonetheless.",7,0,0,22 February 2014
The Patriot," A film ruined by blatant inaccuracies to target blind patriotism
","Thank you, The Patriot, for compelling me so much to sign up on IMDb after being a long-time lurker. There has never been a historical film that infuriates so much as this one. It is possibly one of the least accurate portrayals of the American Revolution I have ever seen, and this film smacked of attempting to curry favour with the American masses. In fact, American patriots would feel disgusted by how badly the events, ideas and people of the American Revolution were depicted in this film.The fact that this film attempts to target the blind, deep-rooted patriotism in America while blatantly trying to mask the historical inaccuracy and complete bias detracts from what could have potentially been a very good film. The directors didn't even attempt to try to be objective. However, this is what the monitored history in the America education system comes to, so I would expect nothing less. One scene portrays this particularly well. The British Army burning down a church? Seriously? That is just truly ridiculous. Most British people were still devout Christians at that time; they wouldn't dare commit such sacrilege. Such mindless script-writing just proves the film-makers will stoop to any lengths to invoke American patriotism, to make the American people feel that there is no-one else who are as honourable and chivalrous as they. It is as if they didn't commit any sort of atrocities themselves in the American Revolution. Nobody remembers that before and after the setting of this film, the very same people portrayed in this film who brought America to salvation were the same people who also displayed the real extent of American treachery when they butchered, back-stabbed and reneged on their sham treaties with natives in the American-Indian Wars, but we won't dwell on that. I wonder why there haven't been any films of recent years portraying that conflict.Every other character in the film laments how the new American nation will be 'the start of a new world where all men are created equal.' Of course, they fail to acknowledge that America failed to meet this criteria still almost 200 years after the film was set – Martin Luther King realised that. This is all hurriedly justified by the scriptwriters in a 10-second scene where the previously racist white man and the ex- slave make up – an entirely predictable scenario that anyone with a brain could see coming from the instant the two of them met. It is all such poor writing.However, credit must be given that this film was actually quite gripping and had a very workable storyline that was very interesting. The vendetta of Benjamin Martin against William Tavington was a great storyline. The actual portrayal of the battles was fascinating, and quite accurate from what I was watching, and the fight sequences were also plausible.War is not pretty, and it is the innocent that suffer the most. The Patriot actually displayed it very well. I am sick of seeing film after film where after the entire film, surprise surprise, none of the main characters have died, except one of course – the sacrificial lamb who's only purpose is to die at the end of the film. This actually makes the film a lot more gripping and interesting, and makes it a lot more realistic too. In war, not everyone comes out alive. It is rare you see this in film, and I am glad to see this occur once in a blue moon.The story was touching and I could sympathise with Mel a lot. Here was me, thinking that kids were immune from deaths in films! The acting itself was quite good too (apart from Cornwallis, who the writers conveniently decided to portray as a moron, because according to them, British commanders were morons. Things never change I guess!). The action scenes were exciting and enthralling, especially the showdown between Isaacs' skirmishers and Ledger's revolutionaries. The final battle was pretty strong too. It's a shame that what could have been a good film was ruined by such patriotic mindlessness.",4,11,21,5 February 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A decent film that unfortunately grew tired towards the end
","I went into the cinema with high expectations, and though I didn't walk out completely blown away, I wasn't completely disappointed by what I saw either, and if you are thinking about watching Avengers: Age of Ultron, then it is certainly worth a watch. For those dubious about how interesting or fresh a rogue AI out to destroy humanity (done countless times before) can be, the wheel has certainly been re-invented on this one.The new additions to the Avengers cast are arguably the strongest. As expected, James Spader is stunning as Ultron, a very complex and charismatic character with a very generous dose of snarky humour that gives the Avengers' jokes and one-liners a run for their money. From Ultron's very first moments, we can already see hurt and a confusion completely atypical of the usual generic robotic villains that have been churned out of Hollywood in the past. And who isn't envious of the mesmerising (and completely natural) voice of James Spader? I could listen to him talk all day.Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) were also strong additions. Quicksilver sparks life into some of the otherwise vacuous action scenes and The Scarlet Witch works her magic on the Avengers, pathing the way for some interesting scenes as her psychic powers are put into play.Then we have our Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Scarlet Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner) doing their usual Avengers stuff. Charming and humorous performances all round, and great chemistry together carried forward from the first film that plays out nicely and keeps the film engaging.Age of Ultron also gives us plenty of food for thought, with there being plenty of moral questionability that sparks internal conflicts between our heroes. This leads to a more interesting and dynamic film much different from the typical superhero movies where all the in- between is just filler for the next explosive setpiece. Ironically, it is some of the action scenes that lack substance, not the rest, in which the character development and subplots were executed very well.Indeed, the first two-thirds of the film were superb, however towards the end in what was supposed to be the climax, the film felt repetitive, predictable, boring. I mean, there are only so many ways Hawkeye can shoot arrows at robots, Captain America can throw his shield at robots, Hulk smashing robots to pieces - it only made what was probably supposed to be a breathtaking complex seem a bit tedious and agonising to watch, which was a real shame.I've already heard claims that Age of Ultron is simply filler for the next phase Infinity War, however, I don't believe this is the case. Age of Ultron offers more dimensions than just a generic 'Superhero must stop Supervillain' that is expected, though coming with the cost of some bland, repetitive action scenes. Credit to Avengers: Age of Ultron that this isn't your typical mindless shot of adrenaline here. Worth a watch.",7,2,7,24 April 2015
Elysium," The film that didn't have an ending.
","I saw the trailer for this, and I was really geared up for watching the film. Interesting though unoriginal story, dazzling dystopian and utopian views and a stellar cast. Unfortunately though, the film was let down by an all-over-the-place plot and a terrible ending (if that is what it can be called). I can't explain my frustration behind the ending without spoiling it, so read no further if you don't want to be spoiled.The first issue that caught my attention was that I could see absolutely no way how the film could be resolved satisfactorily, and part of the reason why I wanted to see Elysium was because I wanted to see how things panned out in the end. Just breaking into Elysium and cutting the rich people down to size is far from a satisfactory ending.It gives me absolutely no pleasure to say that I was right. The concept of the film was just complete nonsense and a complete oxymoron. Matt Damon runs around gormlessly for the second half of the film because even he knows that what he's doing doesn't make sense. HUGE SPOILER INCOMING. So he goes off on a one-way trip to Elysium to sacrifice his life so everybody on Earth can get citizenship to Elysium. What? What? So, what, these idiot directors believe that we're actually going to just absent-mindedly think 'Everyone on Earth gets free healthcare, citizenship and access to Elysium, happy ending! Yay!' The whole concept of the film was just flawed from the start. Here are the main issues, unaddressed and unsolvable:1.) So everyone gets to join the party now? How do these moron protagonists expect the whole population of Earth is going to get a ticket to Elysium and how would they even accommodate them all? It's as if there were no other people on Earth apart from those in Los Angeles. What about all the other of billions of people?! 2.) Who decides who gets the life-saving healthcare and resources first on Earth? How do they decide? Won't it create conflict? Even Elysium couldn't account for probably around ten billion deprived people all making the same demands at once. How will they re-build and prioritise the infrastructure of Earth? Again, who decides? This is another significant problem. 3.) If the researchers looked into population demographics, population momentum ensures that although better quality of life that is handed to the people of Earth from the revolutionary cancer-curing healthcare of Elysium comes with a lower birth rate. The population would continue to rise at a staggering rate, continue to explode as the planet continues to implode from squalor, overexploitation, in-fighting and population strain. Which was why the rich decided to segregate themselves from the rest of the planet in the first place.So actually, Matt Damon achieves nothing. In fact, he probably creates more problems than they started with.If you thought the film 300 was amazing: 300 Spartans taking with them over 10,000 Persians in the Battle of Thermopylae, you'll absolutely love this. Perhaps 6-7 men (and they were a rabble at that) and one rogue overthrew millions in the absolute fiasco that was the Battle of Elysium. I'm sick of this trash. Where were the robot guards? We saw a few when the ship landed, they got shot and that was it. Elysium's defences were non-existent. I'm sure only a dozen would have been enough to mop them all up.Otherwise, the film was decent. The plot with Delacourt attempting to take over Elysium was clever and interesting (although it would have been nice to see what the citizens of Elysium thought about the whole Earth affair), and as that was reaching its climax, even that was cut abruptly and unceremoniously short. It seemed a habit. Whether it be a character, a plot line or an idea, everyone was quickly driven off a cliff and never mentioned again. Major gripes over, otherwise Elysium was interesting (though flawed) conceptually, and there was some great set pieces and brilliant acting. It was heart-breaking at times, and others had us crying with laughter (robots are not empathetic when telling a person they have radiation sickness and are going to die within days). If they had stuck with the plot lines they had and added 15 minutes on the ending to resolve everything, it would have been an outstanding film.",6,1,1,5 February 2014
Cloud Atlas," An outstanding masterpiece (unfortunately under-appreciated)
","I know all the pedantic writers and proofreaders will be criticising me for my terrible grammar when I say 'outstanding masterpiece' because the word masterpiece already implies that the film is outstanding, but that is how highly I feel about this film. It truly is one of the best films ever to hit the screen. Having seen some of the reviews of Cloud Atlas, I feel sorry for those who fail to appreciate the ideas and complexities of Cloud Atlas, as their complaints are usually dripping with dogma and ignorance.How this film was not nominated for a single Oscar is the most outrageous scandal to plague the film industry. When compared to the likes of The Life of Pi and Zero Dark Thirty, there is now at these films stand up to Cloud Atlas - it makes anyone wonder whether the nominations were rigged. Beautifully shot, outstanding score, and completely original, Cloud Atlas really should have been up contending (and winning) the Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Picture. I truly am lost for words how this film came to be so grossly unappreciated by critics and viewers alike. It is shameful that Cloud Atlas has seemed to have flown under the radar unrecognised and unloved by a thankless audience. This film is both artfully enigmatic and simple at the same time. It feels as if I understand the film inside-out, but also as though I will never be able to fully comprehend it. That is the true beauty of Cloud Atlas, and yet this is the element that goes unappreciated or misinterpreted by the many critics of this film.One of the most original films to hit the screen, Cloud Atlas recounts six stories encompassing a range of characters through six different timelines. From the bowels of an American slave ship in 1849 to the struggling descendants of a post-apocalyptic Hawaii, this three-hour epic evokes deep ideas and issues that you can be sure to be thinking about for weeks to come. Watching this film with family or friends is highly recommended as I know personally it was one of the rare films that incited deep discussion between viewers of the concepts and ideas portrayed in the film. The beauty of Cloud Atlas is that there is enough subtlety that every individual interprets the film differently, and there is no right or wrong.All six stories are delicately interwoven by a common theme - the concept of freedom. Whether they are a journalist in possession of a potent secret being doggedly pursued by a deadly hit-man, or an elderly publisher tricked into a care home and terrorised by a tyrannical nurse (played by Hugo Weaving(!) - this particular story was very funny), all were in some way trapped: physically, mentally or otherwise.The cleverest aspect is that various actors/actresses play multiple characters thought the eras - the idea of them being different reincarnations of themselves generation by generation. Each actor plays a definitive role throughout the film that is their persona, and this only enhances the relationship displayed between each story. The stellar cast of well known names (Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Halle Berry to name a few) pull out faultless performances, fitting seamlessly into each role they are given.Each story performs a unique function of its own: one makes us cry, one makes us laugh, one has us gripping onto the very edges of our seats; a comedy, action, tragedy, romance, sci-fi all combined beautifully and masterfully into one dazzling film. An exceptional and unique jewel of a film, this movie is seemingly incredibly under- appreciated at the 7.6 rating it currently holds. This film mysteriously missed out on a lot of awards and deserved, and does deserve far better. Those who fell in love with the film as I did will look back on it as a truly unparalleled classic for generations to come.",10,5,7,9 February 2014
Spectre," Redemption - finally!
","It's taken 4 films for Daniel Craig to finally find his groove, but it looks like it might be a case of 'too little too late' for him. It's the first film of his era where we've had it all: car chases, gadgets (in a nice throwback to Live and Let Die), evil conferences (think Thunderball), quips, stunning backdrops, larger-than-life villains and their impervious henchmen. And not one, but TWO evil- villain-helicopter-getaways. Life doesn't get much better!In all seriousness though, Spectre is innovative, with a hint of nostalgia, and a powerful modern take on our favourite British spy. Christoph Waltz can do no wrong, as ever, with an indulgent and disturbing performance as Bond's enemy Franz Oberhauser. Cut back to London, where M is thrust into a deep political battle, powerless against C's manoeuvring, which makes for some enjoyable interludes between the next set-piece. Doggedly pursuing James Bond on his globe- trotting trip is the zealous Mr. Hinx, which makes for some brilliant action sequences.James Bond takes itself too seriously these days, but this film did not seem plagued by Craig's stone-faced vapidness characteristic of the first three films and the dark feel that is mandatory for many films these days. For die-hard Bond fans, this is true indulgence, with throwbacks littered throughout near every scene. The plot raised some very contemporary issues in this world of drones and mass surveillance, but it never hit you over the head with it, and you could sit back and laugh at the light-hearted humour and Bond charm that has slowly been eroded over the three films preceding it. Without spoilers, I am interested to see how the Bond films proceed from here. The producers seem to be hedging their bets as to whether Daniel Craig will return. After this brilliant film, I think I actually could stand to see him one more time!",9,15,37,3 November 2015
