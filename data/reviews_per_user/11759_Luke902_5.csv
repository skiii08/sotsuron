Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Review: Vol.2
","Tarantino has done it again. Vol.2 answers all of Vol.1's questions and then some. But you must be warned: If you are hoping to see a spectacular action film like Vol.1, then just don't watch this.So, here it goes.In the end of the first film, we learn that The Bride's daughter is alive. But she doesn't know this... Which raises another question: How will this effect/distract her when it comes time to 'Kill Bill'?This is the film I prefer of the 2. It is because, well, it is brilliant. This film answers questions that were never even asked. Tarantino just let his imagination go to work and we got this. I didn't see it coming. I thought I was in for an exhilarating action experience, and I got an engrossing finish to what was before a some what zany story. It all comes full circle. And it does so flawlessly.In this one, her first target is Budd. In one of the best parts of the film, which is 'Chapter 7: The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz' Budd goes to work, and he is a bouncer. He is late (as always, we learn) and is called back to his cocaine-fueled boss's office. He is fired and told by his boss to not where his hat to work. And that's the beauty of it. We see that underneath this character, a murderer though he once was, he is human. He once got paid a lot to kill people, and now is bossed around by some jerk getting paid bum cash and living in a trailer.So, he goes home, sits in his camper and puts a Johnny Cash record on. The Bride creeps from underneath his trailer and swings the door open, but instead of a getting quick kill, she gets shot. This is a point of confusion for all viewers. She survives because she was shot in the chest, and her breasts acted as a shield, absorbing the rock salt from the shotgun shells.We learn how the Bride got so good at killing. She is trained by quite possibly the most dangerous man alive, Pai Mei. We watch her harsh training.Finally, she reaches Bill and, in another touching moment, sees her daughter for the first time.This was one of Tarantino's most daring moves. The Bride and Bill don't have their showdown for a great deal of time after she arrives at his home. But it gets there. And when it does, it is one of the best scenes ever in film history, not for the violence (because there hardly is any), but because of the emotion. Bill is dying, they say their final words to each over, and he dies. But the Bride is not triumphantly howling now that she's done. She is sad. She is sad because she once loved Bill. The film manages to stay realistic in the human aspects of its characters. Though he had done wrong to her, she had forgiven him. And it's because she's done that that she is able to grieve for him, not as the man who shot her, but as the man who was once very near and dear to her. And when you think about it, it is very touching.Vol.2 is pure genius.",10,2,4,7 April 2006
Silent Hill," Gans and Avary make a good adaptation of a great game
","I am so happy that this movie doesn't suck. With all these other film adaptations of games out there that pretty much blow, especially the ones directed by Uwe Boll, my expectations of ever seeing a good game-movie were, well, pretty low. But thankfully, Boll didn't get his hands on the Silent Hill license. When I first heard that Silent Hill was becoming a movie, I was a little worried. 'Who will direct it? And who will write it?' I thought to myself. Then I found out that Roger Avary was writing it and I was a lot less worried. By no means is he a bad writer. But there was still a lingering feeling that it might suck. It came out in theaters and the response was largely positive. Then it came out on DVD and I rented it. Sure enough, it was good. Being a fan of the games, I was delighted by the story, which has a woman (Rose) looking for her lost daughter in the eerily empty town of Silent Hill. So, it has the first game's story. It also takes a few liberties, but thankfully they are good enough to be welcomed. The story holds up and is appropriately dark.Overall, I was very satisfied with everything in the movie. Why? Because it's all f---ed up in that Silent Hill kind of a way. The creatures, the camera angles, and the plot. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of the games or not, this is a movie worthy of your attention.",9,0,0,18 December 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill Review: Vol.1
","Kill Bill vol.1 is a film that contains many emotions, all of which play an important role at some point in the movie. It is an action film at its core, but it has some very tender moments.We see a woman whom we know nothing about, but in the next hour and 50 minutes, we will connect with her, we will become entangled in her story of brutal vengeance, and we will root for her. When 'The Bride' wakes up from her 4-year-long coma, right off the bat we know that she has lost something very valuable: A child. we know this because she grabs her stomach the moment she wakes up and begins to weep because what was inside of her when she was shot is now gone. The scene truly captures the feeling of loss, and moves the film right along storywise.'The Bride' is in a situation. She discovers that she is pregnant and runs off. When I say 'Runs off', I mean that she is running away from both a life and a man of murder. She is an assassin, employed by a dangerous killer by the name of Bill and part of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. She runs to El Paso, meets a nice guy, and they plan to marry. But on her wedding day, she is visited by the Squad. Everyone is slain, except for herself. And now that she's awake she's going to get her revenge on all 5 of them.She knocks 2 of them right off in the first film, Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii. In the first of the two films, many questions are asked. Who is Bill? What are to become of the remaining 3? What is the Bride's real name? And when she finally makes her way to Bill, what will happen?But, in the meantime, there are many things to marvel about. The great swordplay, one of the biggest and bloodiest brawls in movie history, and the sheer level of fun and depth, and that's only the first half!Vol.1 is pure excitement.",10,0,2,7 April 2006
The Departed," Scorcese Is Back Where He Belongs
","Last night, I sat in a dark theater, thrilled to see the words, 'Warner Bros. Pictures Presents' come onto the screen. I have been a Scorcese fan for as long as I can remember, but this was the first time I had ever witnessed one of his brilliant films on the big screen.For starters, let me say that this is the best film that I have seen this year, and I find it sad that it comes so late. There have been no films that have really blown me away this year, and it's already October.But it was worth the wait. I was blown away by the cast members' performances, especially those of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin are fantastic in their roles as Oliver Queenan and Ellerby, respectively. Jack Nicholson plays Frank Costello the only way Jack Nicholson could play a villain, violent, vulgar and insane. And under Martin Scorcese's direction, he becomes the incarnation of evil.The plot is a basic cops-and-robbers tale that makes itself complex, gripping and amazing all at the same time. Frank Costello (Nicholson) is the one man you don't want to meet if you ever find yourself visiting Boston. He's flashy and dangerous, and keeps all together apparently, as he's never been caught for his illegal activity. And there's reason for that: He has a mole working as a police officer in the State Police (a 'Statie' in Boston street slang). The young man who tips Costello off is Colin Sullivan (Damon), who was just a kid when he began working for Costello.Of course, there has to be a good cop. That's where Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) comes in. He has the task of going undercover as a member of Costello's crew.And so begins the intensity of 'The Departed.' I can not give away any of the plot because it is just too good. Mark Wahlberg and Vera Farmiga also deliver solid performances. Martin Scorcese is back where he belongs directing gangster movies, and it shows: The film is packed with Scorcesean violence, heavy profanity and unbelievabely intense scenes. It's gripping, depressing and beautiful. It's the best film of 2006.",10,0,0,29 October 2006
Sin City," One of 2005's Best
","Frank Miller's Sin City is a film that knows no boundaries and gives no apologies. Anyone who has read Frank's Sin City graphic novels will know that this is one of the most faithful adaptations of all time, maybe ever. The panels were practically lifted from the books and animated with actors. Would this film have worked without green screen technology? No. It wouldn't have even worked without Robert Rodriguez handling it. He knew how easy it would have been to screw this film up and make it some dumb action movie. But he did it the way it should have been done. Differences between the books and the movie are few and far between, from the camera angles to the dialogue. The film is black and white, just like the novels, and some things are colored, such as eyes, shoes, blood, etc. There are maybe one or two different lines, but with Miller directing the actors on what to say, it could hardly be called unfaithful. The film is three stories: -One follows John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) protecting a stripper (Jessica Alba) from the vengeful son-of-a-senator pedophile Junior, also known as that yellow bastard (Nick Stahl).-Another follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), a man who is trying to track down the killer of his love, Goldie (Jaime King).-And the last follows Dwight (Clive Owen) making sure a corrupt cop (Benicio Del Toro) doesn't hurt any of the Old Town Girls, lead by Gail (Rosario Dawson).With brilliant directing, great acting and stylistic violence, Sin City turns out to be one of 2005's best films, definitely one of the most stylish I have ever had the pleasure of watching. This is a must see.",10,2,4,29 March 2006
