Mission: Impossible III," Could have established the M:i franchise, but ends up being more self-serving than anything else.
","I went into this film without any real expectations. I had heard mixed reviews and so I watched it with an open mind, hoping for more of the Mission:Impossible magic which started with the first film and was expanded upon (again, with mixed reviews) in M:i:II.The plot was good, and had enough twists and turns built into it to ensure that the viewer could have been thrown all over their chair as it jinxed it's way across the screen, but, sadly, some of those opportunities seem to have been sacrificed for what I can only guess is self-serving propaganda on the part of Mr Cruise.The idea of Ethan being recalled from semi-retirement into active field duties to recover one of his students who has been captured was an interesting lead-in. However questions are raised regarding the relationship he had with his former student and none of those questions are really put to bed in any comprehensive way. The closest we get is Luther being told that Ethan considered her to be like his sister to which he replies 'Did you ever f**k your sister?', but that's as close to enlightened as we get.The juggling act which Ethan has to do trying to have a normal life an relationship as well as maintain his activities with the IMF is a nice feature in this film too. Even if it is a little close to 'True Lies' in some respects.What disappointed me the most, however, was the conclusion of the film. Davian has Ethan's wife held captive and is threatening to shoot her in front of Ethan. When I was watching this I was sure that they were going to kill her off, a la James Bond, and so establish Ethan as an eternal bachelor unable to maintain a real emotional relationship and instead committing completely to the job and the adventures. Instead, it's almost as those the film changes gears, with it going from a testosterone-fueled boys film to a soft and sappy testimonial by Mr Cruise, trying to show the world that he can be a loving and caring husband rather than a cavalier playboy.Very disappointing. I am all for happy endings in films, but when that results in the main character just about being retired from the franchise, I baulk a little.It's an interesting film, with some funky gadgets (even if, for the nerds out there some glaring factual errors are evident - like using alligator clips on 10baseT cable to hack a data connection), some big explosions and some good fight scenes. But it lacks the depth and substance it could have had if it remained true to the M:i vein rather than the Cuise-promoting bandwagon.",4,1,2,10 May 2006
Saw III," Severely Disappointed
","I was a fan of the first Saw - I found the very tightly knitted mix of horror, suspense and twists, and the unpredictability of a relatively new concept really intriguing.Having missed Saw II, I watched Saw III hoping that the initial formula had somehow been extended and maintained.... I was most certainly disappointed.The first few 'challenges' were nothing more than a gore-fest. The thrill and suspense of the challenges faced in the original Saw replaced with ideas designed to do nothing more than test how well you could hold onto your last meal. There was no rhyme, no reason, and paper-thin plots. Although, I do admit that the plots may have been thicker if I had seen Saw II. But any episode in a good series should be able to stand on it's own without _needing_ the prior episodes to work.After enduring the first 20 minutes of blood and guts the storyline of the movie started to develop, but it was hard to actually connect with it as there was the constant fear that the next second another disembowelment or similar would jar you out of the storyline again.I think that the only real review and punishment for this film would probably be to lock the director/producer/writer into a chair and give them a choice of watching the film continuously or hacking their own legs off. I think they'd lose their legs, if they have any taste.",1,76,129,2 November 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," 'A Tarantino Masterpiece' or 'A Big-budget Film Student Project'
","Having seen a number of Quentin Tarantino's films, and havingbeen caught up in the hype surrounding the release of this film, Imay have walked into the cinema with higher expectations than Ishould have. Although I was intrigued by the changes in film style (switchingfrom mono-chromatic to anime to being saturated with color), Iwas left with the distinct impression that this level ofexperimentation with different techniques was closer to thatexpected of a new film student who hasn't yet learnt to stick to atried-and-true formula. I hate to have to say it, but I think that any martial art film fan, givena few weeks worth of film training, a multi-million dollar budget, acast of veteran actors and a few thousand litres of fake blood couldhave done the same, if not better, a job. If you are looking for an interesting way to spend a couple of hours,then this film is for you. If you're looking for something asstimulating as 'Reservior Dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction' then your moneyis probably better spent buying on of those two films on DVD.",3,2,3,28 October 2003
