The Rock," my big fat obnoxious boss William august
","Alright, i just got it from the trades that William August (a.k.a. Mr. Paul Todd from 'my big fat obnoxious boss') has a cameo role in 'The Rock.' He plays the leader of the squadron of pilots who are in charge of bombing Alcatraz! YEAH!!?? The guy who gives them the instructions! I can't believe those loser contestants on the show didn't recognize him. Just when you think you've seen it all right? For some reason the sight hasn't updated him on their web page yet because he was also in 'Anchorman' and they don't have that listed. We definitely need to contact the server. Also, there's some good shots of Mr. Todd playing b-ball in euro league back in the 80's. Finally, the only problem i see with 'the rock' is that sometimes when I dream that I'm Stanley Goodspeed, I wish I had had more than three weeks of weapons training.",Null,1,1,24 December 2004
