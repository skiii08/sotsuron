Iron Man 3," Bad Movie
","Awful movie. No depth in the slightest. Robert Downy Jr let himself down with this. The whole movie was like a sad sequel to The Avengers than an Iron Man 3 Film. Acting is bad. Script is bad. Directing is bad. Story is bad. Just a jumble of a movie and a surprise considering the previous were good, I found myself wondering whether they'd had the budget cut or something towards the middle of the movie because I couldn't believe Iron Man 3 was that TEPID. Boring wet floppy fish of an Action movie. I was hoping for kick ass action, big effects, a little comedy but instead i got a wet, depressed Downey Jr for 70 minutes of the film before finally we get a little Iron Man action, which in itself was quite disappointing. I never write reviews I felt I had to write this to air my disappointment.",1,2,6,14 July 2013
