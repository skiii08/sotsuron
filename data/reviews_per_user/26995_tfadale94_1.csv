The Blair Witch Project," What the actual...
","Literally the worst movie I've seen thus far, and that includes screening for undergrad film majors. What are you people thinking giving this high ratings? Let me break it down. 'You had to have an imagination/it's all left up to the imagination.' Okay, so yeah, it's supposed to be psychologically scary. It's a little difficult to be lost in your inner fears with Heather screaming like a self-centered crazy woman. Seriously, shut up. If she would have been even a tiny bit less annoying, it'd have been easier to go into the '...what if...''s that my mind wanted to throw out there. Make Josh disappear sooner and perhaps have him scream every night for two nights or more. That's the only part in the movie when I was a little scared. What happened to Josh? Why is he yelling? AH!But we never know, and the mind takes it to the goriest, most painful experience imaginable. Only well-done part of the movie. 'The editing was spot on/first person camera is so immersive!' I'm sorry, but what person jiggles and shakes around that much when walking in the woods? Try it. When you walk, your vision does wobble a bit, but not in the nausea-inducing way the cameras do in BWP. I didn't feel like I was there, I felt like I had a migraine coming on. I get it, it's supposed to be that the viewer found the footage in the woods. But... it didn't feel like that. For that to happen, I would have preferred a police officer or something to introduce us to the footage, not just a black screen and words.'The ending was so scary/the locals built suspense!' It wasn't suspenseful. The moment it was mentioned how the kids were killed, we all knew what was going to happen. Seriously people. NOT SUSPENSEFUL. 'The acting was so honest/believable/ad hoc!' Cut out Heather. Just get a new actor, she isn't believable as a person, an actor, or a character. About as 'deeply sorry' as Hitler. Annoying enough to make me WANT her to die. Incessant talking? No. Just, no. Stop. And the way all the actors sort of faced each other awkwardly like a school play for a good majority of the film? Unprofessional and not believable one bit. They didn't work together one bit. Just burn it, and start over.",1,2,3,21 February 2013
