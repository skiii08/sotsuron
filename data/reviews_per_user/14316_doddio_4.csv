Hereditary," Not bad, for a horror movie
","This is actually a pretty decent family drama, with a few good scares, but it suffers from the 'shrill wife, wooden husband' trope, which drags things down in the second half.Seriously, producers, if your plot depends on a shrill wife, rethink it. No one wants to watch that; it's lazy, sexist, annoying and almost impossible to act well, because it's so contrived. How about a 'strong wife' instead?",6,0,2,18 December 2018
Us," Bungled storytelling yields a vacuous woke thrill-ride
","An interesting premise, great production values, likeable characters, a few good thrills and laughs unfortunately add up to less than the sum of the parts thanks to ham-handed storytelling.When you have to end the movie with a lengthy monologue explaining the entire thing, you've failed as a storyteller. Go back to square one, and start over.Also, surely someone must have noticed that the evil woman's scary voice was embarrassingly pathetic.Overall, seems like Jordan Peele needs some critical feedback earlier in the process so that he can reach his full potential and not end up like M. Night Shyamalan.",5,0,0,31 March 2019
Bird Box," Turd Box
","A lazy, dull and derivative mash-up of a bunch of thrillers and cardboard characters we've all seen before.The basic premise was most notably laid down in Monty Python's The Funniest Joke in the World, except they actually meant to make a joke.",2,3,5,29 December 2018
Green Book," Great movie and a great *Christmas* movie!
","There are very few movies out there that are both great movies and great Christmas movies, and this is definitely amongst the few.Do yourself a favour, and if you haven't seen this yet, save it for Christmas Eve.",9,1,2,25 February 2019
