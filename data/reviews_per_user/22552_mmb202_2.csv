The Sound of Music," A Must-see film for everyone!
","The Sound Of Music is a simple movie. Its plot and how it was laid out is simple in a way that it makes you wonder why it gives out such a great impact on the audience. I found myself greatly inspired by this film. After I watched it, I seem to love life a little bit more. The Sound Of Music truly proves that simplicity is beauty.The songs performed in this film are all timeless classics. The Sound Of Music is a delightful movie for all ages. Everyone in the family of today could relate to the characters in the film even though this movie was made almost 4 decades ago.I couldn't think of a better artist to play Maria than Julie Andrews. Her voice is ever so captivating and her acting is excellent. She's perfect for the role and she gives a performance of a lifetime.The whole cast is amazing, especially Captain Von Trapp (played by Christopher Plummer) and all the adorable 7 children.It's amazing how this movie can touch you. It's one of those movies that you just can't get enough if you loved it the first time you saw it, undoubtedly you'll watch it over and over again! It deserves every award it got especially being the Best Picture in the Oscars during its time, or even more. This movie/musical will remain one of the few best classics ever. And everyone in the world should see it!",10,1,7,3 January 2002
Cast Away," A Wise Film
","'Cast Away' is an interesting film in the first place for a lot of reasons. One being the ever so famous Tom Hanks as the star, 2nd being Robert Zemeckis as the director, 3rd for having an intriguing plot that makes one wonder what really is the fuss behind a Fed Ex guy stranded on a deserted island due to a plane crash.I really enjoyed watching this movie. It's indeed a worthwhile experience. 'Cast Away' is a film with wisdom. It shows a lot of metaphors (sometimes with humor) to the truths we go through in life, and the one thing that it points out couldn't be more clearer to me by the time I finished watching the film. This film made me appreciate what life has to offer for me and eventually taught me more reasons why we shouldn't give up in life.Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis's 2nd collaboration (Forrest Gump being the first one) in this film is an excellent idea. They're both geniuses in their fields. The rest of the cast and crew of 'Cast Away' also did an excellent job.Definitely a worthy movie to buy in DVD. Go watch 'Cast Away' if you still haven't! You'll laugh and maybe you'll cry during the sad scenes, but most importantly, you'll learn.",10,0,0,2 August 2002
