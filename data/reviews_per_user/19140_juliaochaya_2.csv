Requiem for a Dream," Everyone should watch it
","This movie deeply disturbed me. I was thinking of it everyday for about a year after I saw it. It's a heavy but a very important movie that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. Truly hats off to Darren Aronofsky for managing to make such an impressively impactful movie.
Also the acting is truly phenomenal especially Ellen Burstyn!!!",10,0,0,26 June 2020
The Lion King," Why??????
","This movie DID NOT need a remake. All the the new Disney live action remakes has been awful. Obviously just cash grabs, no soul and heart like the originals have. Wish they could just go back to 2D animation. Very disappointed in Disney.",2,0,0,25 June 2020
