Insidious: Chapter 2," Great
","I saw some families bringing small kids for the movie, they kept screaming throughout. My friend was scared too. The 'ghosts' or whatever was a lot freakier than I thought. And the movie was funny too! Lastly, I find it amazing that both the director and the composer acted in the movie. You have to watch this, this is better than all the other horror movies this year. It is better than Insidious 1 and 2 because it had none of the irritating parents. I liked the dysfunctional family and touching drama. And the actors who were really good and young--these are real teenagers portraying teens. So all in all, well done directors!",10,0,1,30 June 2015
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," If I'd wanted to watch people slurp the heck out of something, I'd rather see them doing that to dessert
","Into the first 5 seconds of the movie, Jacob took off his shirt. I am not a Twilight fan, and have only watched half of the first movie. I thought this movie would be delightfully bloody and decided to check this out. With my best friend. Little did I know it would be awkward since every alternate second Bella and Edward are sucking one another's soul. The Vampires are depicted as cool, cultured, impeccably fashionable gods, while the werewolves are 'Black' peasants wearing normal old clothes, and not looking too delicately pretty themselves. I mean, Leah looks horrible. This makes the vampires seem like the pretty princesses and princes in fairy tales and werewolves as the bad guys. Who the heck would choose the werewolves then? The worst part is, when Bella became a vampire, she suddenly got gold eyeshadow and make up, and the whole theatre laughed. Wow, to become a vampire just so you could have colored eyes without contacts and natural makeup? And still only looking a bit better and certainly not as good as some good ol' humans, I think that is an EPIC FAIL. Just like this movie.",1,30,48,30 November 2011
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A for AWESOME
","Let me just clarify, I am not a rabid fan of the book or author. I only knew Abe Lincoln based on his inspiring failures. Being a teenager, I like vampire and zombie flicks, but I was a bit wary of actually seeing a historical figure mash up. So, I decided to watch this movie in 3D since there was nothing else good at the moment. Actually, besides the title, there is nothing funny about this movie. The 3D was actually quite bright (unlike SOME movies) and the medieval settings pretty to see. The actors and actresses were tall and goodlooking. And now that I think about it, it is very possible that Abe COULD be a fighting sort of guy. When the action starts, we get slow motion and close ups of black goo which is quite tense and scary. The good guys are not always good at fighting (look at Speed) and we are all kept on the edge of our seats. My friend guessed wrongly that either Mary or Will are vampires, when actually it's someone else, so this film is so not predictable. Although many answers were not explained, such as how come some people die after being bitten while others turned, it all makes for a mysterious ride. There are many throwbacks to previous things that made sense. Etc the pocket watch, lines such as 'History prefers legends to men', 'a man only gets this drunk when he wants to woo a girl or kill a man', and 'we are all slaves' repeated at the start and the end, all were a nice way to present the continuity. Abe might be dead, but his legacy lived on, there will always be people willing to stand up against darkness. The jokes were also really funny. Of course if you're a history nut you would hate this movie, but if you want BELIEVABLE action (no flying kungfu), mature romance (none of that teenage angst), comedy and, thriller, you should watch this. Much better than other vampire flicks coming up (etc Breaking Dawn Part 2) or 3D films (Prometheus).",10,8,12,6 July 2012
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Bitter taste
","I was just rereading all my Narnia books, starting from 'The Silver Chair', 'The Magician's Nephew', 'The Horse and His Boy', and finally 'the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'. This movie, which I had watched long ago, suddenly make me feel captivated again. The extra scenes do little to distract you from the story, such as war scenes. The actors are also well cast. Some details are observed: like the dead insect in the Wardrobe room. The faun's music is also sad and wonderful all at once. The special effects were rather cool. The music was also excellent. The fox was a weird but welcome addition. However, some parts are honestly weird. Lucy (the Valiant) is hardly the sort of girl to scream when she spotted the faun. Also, the faun's room is not very cozy but scary. When the dwarf attacked Edmund, it is also exaggerated. The argument between Susan and Peter was also abrupt and unreasonable. Also, why were there other frozen beavers? Their escape was supposed to be happy and relaxed, not frightened. Why is Tumnus alive and well to talk with Edmund? And the order of the gifts are wrong, it should be beavers first then Peter then Susan then Lucy. The Beavers got nothing, and the children got no feast ): The part where the wolves took Beaver hostage and caused Peter to act cowardly is retarded, Peter IS a hero, that's why he's High King, and not just because he's oldest. Stop dumbing the kids down! Edmund's journey was also unseen, and that's sad because that is where Edmund is redeemed. All in all, it started out well but ended like crap so we're left with a pretty horrible view of it.",3,0,2,4 January 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America Is My New Hero
","When I first saw the first Captain America movie on DVD, I thought it was OK, slightly boring with the over-the-top Hugo Weaving as Hydra and the mad scientist. Only the last scene had me in tears. So when I said I wanted to watch this movie, many of my friends said it was quite boring, comparing it to Man of Steel. But I was glad that I watched it, because I think it's comparable to Avengers! First of all, the acting. All the good guys can act, Samuel L Jackson (How can he even emote with 1 eye? Marvelous), Sam, Chris Evans, Agent Hill etc. I liked how that the women were given more prominent roles, with Black Widow being the brains of the operation. Although she did have to be romantic with Steve and keep on talking about dates. Luckily, Steve kind of rejected that. He is just the type to love one woman forever! I think that kind of devotion is really the norm back in the 40s, and that is so rare, nowadays movies have a lot of kisses and hugs, more doesn't mean that it is meaningful. Another thing I really like about the movie is how Steve showed us to be true to ourselves. Just because he is a soldier doesn't mean he had to follow orders. It's what we do that matters, not who we are. Lastly, I am so shipping Captain America and Winter Soldier. Well, at the end Steve face a dilemma, whether to kill his friend or be killed. If it were me, I think I'd just save myself. But that is not his style. He just has so much faith in everyone that it just blows me away. He values teamwork and is a really transformational leader. Talking about the movie, it was really funny and the action scenes were great. The plot was really complicated for a superhero movie, but just stick it out and it pays off.",10,5,10,4 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This movie stinks
","Now i know why this movie got remade into an animated flick. it would be less irritating as a result. Where to start? first off, this movie is really boring. ignoring the fact that in space, shootings will make no sound, the spacecrafts are so cheesy and convoluted. cheesy moments between padme and Annie, Yoda saying wise crap, etc. half-hearted attempts made on the senator's life (if people like presidents and singers can get assassinated, much easier a senator can be), its just so clich√©d! Then the acting abilities. Annie is just a pretty face. He screws up his face to act emo and evil. He has no emotions. He sounds fake when talking about how much he love Padme. Natalie Portman doesn't look like she can do yoga, much less fight, she's too skinny. Annie's mother's death scene is so fake! The evil cloner guy's son also can't act, he smiles evilly, but didn't pull it off. The plot is almost nonexistent. In fact, you could fast forward to the last hour and not miss anything. All the best ridiculous action are there. You see Yoda whizzing like a bullet, that's classic! Im not really a star wars fan, but i respect the intense amount of work put into the old movies. But this movie reeks of cheesiness, be warned! P.S. The music is too loud, and the talking are soft. Bad combination. The music also swells cheesily whenever Padme talk with Annie. Plot: 1/10 Acting: 1/10 Music: 5/10 Special effects: 10/10 Overall: 4.25/10",4,0,2,30 November 2008
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Really interesting
","I like how recent fairytale adaptations are more darker and violent then we expected, going back to the middle ages. However, there were 2 flaws. 1 is that nothing is really explained to us leaving us to wonder about the whole mythology of witches in their world. Etc if your blood is supposed to be a witch, then you can choose not to be one? Or is it the other way round? 2 is how the movie is too realistic which doesn't feel like fantasy but more like an action movie with a superpowered villain. Other than that, there were great points. 1. Gemma was the perfect Gretel. She was vicious and smart from the beginning, seeing as how she yelled at the witch in the gingerbread house since she was young. She is also kind, seeing as how she cared more about the children's lives than her own, asking Hansel to save them instead. She also cared for Edward despite his ugly appearance. Finally, she was not afraid to get a little dirty during fights. 2. Hansel is more like the shy, quiet brother. He gets distracted easily by women, but at least he fights well with Gemma. 3. I don't see the point of white witches since they can't even protect themselves or others. 4. The witches are ugly, making it easy for you to hate them. Muriel was really powerful and cunning, a worthy opponent. But I am still confused as to what is a grand witch and how to become one? Finally, just watch this movie. It's really exciting, and it trolls Twilight, as in there is literally a troll called Edward and Hansel is like who the **** is Edward?",8,1,4,1 March 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not so amazing spiderman
","Let's see, I like my action movies fast and furious like any other guy. I even had fun watching movies like Transformers and MI4 for the cool fighting and stuff. But for superhero movies, one should choose selectively. The hero should have values that you agree with, and that is why I only watch Spiderman and Batman movies. Good things first. Uncle Ben was amazing, humorous and strict. Aunt May was fine as Peter was not supposed to be as close to her as Uncle Ben anyway--that was something the previous Spiderman movies didn't do. I'm glad they made her less important here. Also, there is no clich√© 'With great power comes great responsibility' line here, which is good as Uncle Ben was not the one who originally said it. I also liked that the camera focused on small details such as tiny lizards everywhere. Sadly, why was Gwen a perfectly well-adjusted teenager? She's not supposed to have a mother and brothers. Also, Flash was actually half-way decent--Peter became the jerk instead, showing off (in front of paint brush girl at the basketball game). I get that Spidey was quite sarcastic and quipey, but his alter-ego Peter was supposed to keep that in check. He's the nerd that has all the comebacks, but he's too nice to say it. Well Garfield is as far away from nice as the Earth is from the sun, he was more like the violent abusive guy who breaks glass doors. He didn't even have a reason to be that angry. Furthermore, Garfield's version of Spiderman is petty and childish. Why the heck would he not chase after the bad guy just because the cashier did not allow him to buy MILK?! It's only MILK and 2 FREAKING CENTS. The real spiderman should not be so petty and selfish and immature. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. Disappointingly, I see no trace of the 'rumoured' hot and fiery chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Stone is quite pretty as Gwen, but Garfield was a stammering, incoherent and horny mess. All he wanted to do was kiss Gwen, and why the hell did he even tell her who he is? Why would he trust her so easily when they just started talking like a week ago? If you want to watch cool moves, really funny dialogues, then just watch. But if you want something deeper, something about the inner psyche of Spiderman, plus believable romance between leads, then you shouldn't watch this movie. I walked out half an hour earlier because it's just not that interesting. Peter always wins, blah blah blah, you don't even feel any tension, unlike the past movies where Peter is the underdog.",5,4,14,2 July 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," As Good as How Good a Movie Can Be
","I had my doubts whether Peter Jackson would be a 'three-hit wonder', but after watching the Hobbit the day it premiered, I couldn't be more wrong. The story started out slow, gathering momentum. Jackson did some smart moves by purposely not letting us see how the dragon looks like for suspense. After rewatching LOTR, I realised how much effort Jackson made in ensuring continuity. For example, did you know that Frodo and Bilbo were wearing the exact same clothes in LOTR? I mean, nobody would noticed if they did not, but he made them wear it anyway. This shows how good a director Jackson is. In fact, the movie is so good that I watched it twice. I feel that more emphasis should be given on each dwarf, besides the 3 goodlooking ones (Thorin, Kili, Fili), as I can't really differentiate between them. Also, Gandalf exists as a mere deux ex machina to save the day. My favourite moments would be their 'roller-coaster' like battles with Azog (jumping from tree to tree) and trapped below ground. Misfortune seems to find them all the time. Also, I especially liked the riddles between Gollum and Bilbo. The most important thing of the movie is it is much more thrilling with 3D and is funnier than LOTR. This movie also taught me some pretty important quotes. Gandalf said, 'Saruman believes it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I have found. I found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay... small acts of kindness and love.' This practically goes against all the banal Disney superhero tripe that someone 'Superman/Batman' always saves the day, but they don't realise that crap wouldn't happen if the citizens weren't so messed up anyway. All in all, the movie is very exciting and sometimes scary, but the story is deep with beautiful words and ideology.",10,4,14,14 December 2012
Aladdin," Modern Feminist and Value Adding to the original
","Aladdin is what Beauty and the Beast should have been like. Aladdin and Jasmine had great chemistry and Jasmine's singing voice is the best out of all the female leads in previous movies.
People often wonder why they should watch a live-action remake when the cartoon version is already so good. And Disney's live action were often disappointments, copy the original scene by scene. Not this one. Aladdin is the first and only disney princess movie to be named after a male lead, but it is also the most feminist and empowering one.
I was surprised to see that Jasmine is not a damsel in distress but she actually do something. She is the true star of the movie. Aladdin was a lost poor boy until he met her and unlocked his true potential.
The movie is exciting, both visually and in terms of action.",10,6,17,26 May 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Let The Bromance Begin!!
","I was very reluctant to watch this movie because I was disappointed with the 1st movie. But since it was the only movie showing, I decided to watch it. I did not regret my choice. The pros: The villains were really good at their portrayal. Harry not only looked like an emo teenager who whispers and sport a goth haircut, he had a real reason to save his own skin. Max Dillon was very pitiful as a villain and he seems to reflect all the teenagers who want to be seen on social media. Max is like a stalker who had a crush on his hero Peter. But when Peter scorned him, Max turned to Harry, because Harry said he needed him, and all that mushy stuff. Gwen Stacy grew a backbone and became a perfect woman who is smart AND beautiful. The movie was also very action-packed and long. Cons: Am I the only one who thinks Gwen is a hypocrite? If she want to be successful so much, why did she lead Peter on when she''s going to England? She seems very indecisive about whether she want to be with Peter or not, and her death, is purely caused by her wilfulness. She is also dressed really unrealistically like for her interview, which made this movie less realistic. Peter also looked uglier than ever, and selfish as always, because he thinks he is doing what he thinks is best for Harry. Well, what can you expect from these 'non best friends' who didn't talk for 8 years? Overall, if you try to ignore Peter and his whole self-righteousness thing, then focus on the handsome Harry and the pitiful Max, then you will enjoy the movie.",7,1,6,6 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," It's a different kind of marvel
","So I watched this movie because it's Marvel, but I don't know a single thing about the backstory. And also for the good-looking Karen Gillan and Lee Pace (who definitely do not look good here but more like unrecognizable). At first, it is really confusing. Not until halfway through the movie did things start to fall into place. Here are the few reasons why you should watch this movie. 1. Groot. He is really cute but also good at fighting. I reckon he will be as popular as Minions soon. 2. Rocket. He is also cute and really funny with all his puns. 3. Drax. At first you find him irritating. I think he looks like Jeremy Renner (hawkeye). He deadpans a lot. But then he became funnier when he's interacting with Groot. 4. The visuals. I think the city of Zandar look great and all their gadgets is like 'Men in Black'. 5. Karen Gillan. She sounds really smooth and she looks so eerie. Somehow I think Peter's mother look like her. 6. The violence. Although this movie is supposed to be lighter and not so serious, the violence is more than other Marvel movies. Want to see a 'pen' stabbing in and out of people? How about impalements? You can see them here. 7. Anti-heroes. If that's your thing, you can have your fill of them. Only Groot and Peter seems the most heroic. 8. The plot is simple. Just break out of prison and run from the bad guys and get the orb. No multi-layers of intricate plot. Things I did not really like: 1. The alien makeup kind of restricts the emotions of the face? You can't tell from looking at them. 2. Zoe Saldana always plays the stoic action girl like Colombiana etc so it gets really boring. And no idea when did Peter fall in 'love' with her. I'm like in Avengers there is no obvious 'love'. To conclude, if you like simple, funny movies, just watch this. This is the best kind of simple, funny movies. I like these kinds of movies too so I'm quite satisfied with it.",10,1,5,31 July 2014
Jurassic World," I'm an armchair dinosaur expert and I loved it
","Firstly, I would like to establish my credentials. I've been to all the ancient paleozoological museums and dinosaur exhibitions in my country, and I know about the difference between dinosaurs, names ending in -suchus are reptiles and mammal-like reptiles like ischigualastia and chaliminia. I also know that most of the dinosaurs including T-Rex is in the cretaceous period and not Jurassic. And most recently, the dinosaur that appeared in the first scene in Transformers 4 is a scaphonyx, and thus, herbivorous, not eating meat as shown. 1. So we need to get aside the problem of dinosaurs not looking 'realistic'. Well, as long as there is some rational explanation, such as 'filling up the gaps of DNA', then it's OK. So not a big problem. 2. The irritating children. As a 21 year old, I find myself getting touched by the interaction between the boys. The younger one is familiar from Insidious and Iron Man 3--he's cute. I think their sibling dynamic is realistic. I've got a really young sister and I also act like Zack, jerk and rebel. 3. There is hot chemistry between the leads. I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out who Claire was--I kept on thinking Emma Stone then I realized it's the other Gwen Stacy. Chris Pratt looked like Patrick Wilson and Jensen Ackles. They would have made a hot couple. Only problem is how did Claire survive in high heels? And why did her hair suddenly turn curly. 4. The movie is very funny. From helicopter hijinks to flirting dialogue. 5. A lot of foreshadowing. We're shown the mosasaur 3 times, I'm sure there's a reason and not just for the cool factor. It's not a deux ex machina if you're aware of it. Overall, this is an unexpected summer box office hit--don't miss it. You will not be disappointed, as long as you have a sibling, loved Guardians of the Galaxy, or dinosaurs.",10,64,112,15 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Disappointed
","Let's start with the good. 1. Unintentional Taylor Swift easter eggs. Dialogue feature Captain America saying: 'So we're just supposed to SHAKE IT OFF?' And then 'run and hide...'. And finally, Black Widow says 'Nothing lasts forever'. And then Captain says 'except for TROUBLE TROUBLE'. 2. Cool characters like the twins. But weird that they kept on saying 'enhanced' instead of 'mutant'. The bad. 1. WHY?! did Black Widow like Hulk? Since when?! I thought she and Hawkeye were a thing! And suddenly Hawkeye is out of the picture with a family? And I can't believe Black Widow would be so vulnerable about her feelings, or care that she can't have children. She's tough, it's such a 180. 2. No Loki. The villain Ultron was lame and not a threat. He's just a machine. 3. Less funny from Iron Man, who seems like a douche. Overall, I feel that only Captain America and Thor acted as expected. It's OK but too long, too action.",7,2,6,15 June 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," not that bad
","i think this film is better than the first. we get to see more action, and this film is not entirely devoid of character development. pros: more emotion from mikaela who shouts that she loves Sam. also, i like the autobot twins, wheelie and jetfire, and Leo and Simmons are a welcome distraction. cons: really confusing. Sam suddenly became an intellectual, and many things were not explained. the robot girl was disgusting. and utensils randomly turning into robots are weird. sam's mom is weird, behaving like a loony, and his dad is very calm at first but turns emotional later on. overall, this movie is quite exciting, but, like candy, it does not last.",7,5,12,27 June 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Not bad, but...
","If this has any other title, i would think it was a brilliant movie. Funny, action packed, itriguing... alas, it is called sherlock Holmes. When i was young, i was an avid reader of sherlock Holmes books. i read the likes of 'the speckled band', 'the hounds of baskerville', etc. How did sherlock became a pro fighter? And why is he such an asshole? Like always making Mary and Watson mad. Sure, he's a genius, but in no way does he demonstrate his smartness like some obnoxious egomaniac, like how he did with Mary. like, oh, you're a governess, you... then he prattles on and on. Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be a brilliant man, but nice too. And Irene Adler is a slut! Stripping sherlock, kissing him? And the black magic stuff is... weird. that seems out of place in Victorian england. The good points is that there is real chemistry between sherlock and Watson, and the acting is real good. the scenes look real too.",7,6,14,5 January 2010
WALL¬∑E," A Convenient Truth
","Wall E is the most excellent, thought provoking film there is since SpiderMan's (with great power comes great responsibility). It gives us the haunting truth about the 'utopia' life we'll have, if we don't do something NOW to conserve this wonderful planet, to stop pollution. Using actions instead of words, Wall E continues to do his duty though he is the only one left. He is also very humane, caring for the cockroach, and very friendly towards Eve, though she tried to kill him many times at first. He would also sacrifice himself for Earth, and he nearly died. Wall E might tremble at the sight of a spaceship, but he is incredibly brave in rescuing Eve and the shoot. The scene with the couple singing and holding hands really strikes a chord into our hearts. He might be outdated as a robot, but he would do anything to save Earth. Eve was at first a cold robot, but after Wall E touches her, she became more interesting, especially when she thought Wall E had forgotten her, she looked so crushed. She was also cool as a flying supergirlfriend. Also, though she likes to laser many things, she is nice to the cockroach too. The captain is a nice guy, he is willing to do what many generations ahead of him had opted for the easy way, face the damage of earth and do his best, because THIS IS OUR HOME!! He'd rather do the right thing than the easy thing. GO! The idea of humans becoming lazy and dependent on robots is frightening. We would only care about ourselves and dump Earth. Maybe dump the spaceship too if it's got too much trash. I hope we will not end up like this!! Can't even stand, or turn over, relying on a robot and chair. Wall E is great! DON'T MISS THE BEST MOVIE THERE EVER WAS!",10,5,9,4 September 2008
Lucy," Not as good as I imagined
","I wanted to watch Lucy purely because of Scarlett Johansson and the Kimberley Perry hairstyle. Pros: Exciting film Can be funny Scarlett Johansson Korean guys who speak in Korean so we feel the same confusion that Lucy do. It would be good to put in subs when Lucy can understand Korean though.Cons: The director treats us like idiots. Eg when Morgan Freeman talked about disaster, the movie shows clips of hurricanes and earthquakes, like we don't know what is disaster. Nothing is ever explained There is no motivation for the bad guy Lucy suddenly change from wimpish to brave instantaneously without explaining that the drug will cause her to be immune to pain etc. Movie is too shortOverall, just watch if you want to look at pretty images for 1.5 hours.",5,16,37,31 August 2014
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Exciting but Hilarious in a bad way
","So the effects were spectacular--come on, we've all fantasized about how Hogwarts would be torn apart, haha, and how the stone soldiers will fight giants. But it was really funny in an unintended way. 1. Moldy Voldy seems to be a weak doddering old man, with no menacing air at all. 2. Snape makes me want to fall asleep as he talks to s-l-o-w-l-y. But he looked quite handsome when he's in love with Lily Potter, and as a kid. Hehe once in his lifetime probably. 3. Dumbledore looked evil 4. Harry suddenly became really pro at dueling. 5. Ron is a idiot who just states the really obvious 6. Hermione becomes dumber after just one kiss from Ron. 7. Neville suddenly become a hero that always carry his sword around. 8. Prof McGonagall rocks. The funny parts: When Voldy kill Harry, he purposely drag out the 'AVAHDAR KEDAVRA' which he thinks sounds epic but which really sounds hilarious. Bad dialogue. Voldy: 'the boy who lived...' no longer? Harry: 'You-know-who' sucked? Yeah, he sucked. Funny images including baby Harry with the weird lightning scar. When Voldy laughed and kept on repeating Harry Potter's death. seriously the whole cinema laughed. When the death eaters storm into Hogwarts with Harry and giants roll off the cliff--OMG those dumb giants were farming and then they're too fat and roll off, HAHA. When Neville woke up admist the fighting and he looked dazed, really funny. The giant protective sphere being attacked by 'fireworks'--looked like sperms attacking an egg lol. I guess some people will cry because they're sentimental, but to me and my friends, it is just hilariously funny. I love Harry Potter, but to me this seems more like a TV final episode than a stand alone movie.",6,4,8,14 July 2011
Life," Worst Movie of 2017
","My mom told me that she had free tickets for this tonight, and I asked all my friends to see who can make it at such short notice. Firstly, the movie was very boring. You hardly care about any of the characters. So when they die, nobody cares. Secondly, the astronauts are stupid and unprofessional. The spaceship is also very stupid for a $200 billion vehicle. A lot of the things are manual and doesn't work and you cannot press the buttons all at once. Thirdly, the alien is very lucky. It just wouldn't die and it eats everything. It is also impossibly smart like figure out how to use the controls. Lastly, the film is very gory. Why is there a need for so much blood again? Am I watching Saw IX: Space Edition? I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Halfway through I was apologising to my friend for making her watch this movie. We were both hiding in our seats covering our eyes. When Dr North said there was 39 minutes until the spaceship reaches earth, I said: 'There's 39 minutes until the end of this movie?!' And the whole cinema chuckled.",1,18,41,8 April 2017
Spectre," Just ignore plot holes and sexist characters, it will be spectacular.
","Let's have the good first: 1. Spectre is not boring, unlike the other James Bond films. 2. It is thrilling. From walking on high buildings to fighting in a helicopter to watching the bad guy dig someone's eyes. And Bond in bondage 'heh'. 3. The song was nice. 4. I like the side characters, Q, M and Moneypenny. 5. The movie is very funny! Especially Q, and M. C stands for careless. The bad: 1. Weird octopus. So, Spectre has more in common with skeletons and ghosts (hence Day of the Dead) than octopi. 2. James Bond has to sleep with every girl he sees. 3. I hate Madeleine 'Swann'--how come she's not named after her father? Like her predecessors with the same sappy surname Bella and Elizabeth, she is a Mary Sue. Smart, beautiful, and still likes a guy old enough to be her father. Oh, and a hypocrite as well, since I thought she hated James. The more I watch, the uglier she looks with her gap teeth, far-distanced brows, eye bags and high forehead. 4. Monica looks old, but at least she has more chemistry with James... 5. James Bond is too lucky. He fell and landed on a sofa--where did that come from? He found Madeleine at the last second--yeah right.",6,1,4,29 November 2015
