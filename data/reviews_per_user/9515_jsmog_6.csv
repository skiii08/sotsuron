The Blair Witch Project," If you're scared of the woods, this is the film for you.
","I saw this film long after the hype had passed, in December of 2000.  As someone who does quite a bit of hiking, this film hit home.  It has the problems of any low-budget film, but the overriding fear of the strange things that happen in the woods (and every hiker has such a story) really hit home.  Highly recommended.",8,1,2,25 December 2000
Fight Club," Could have been tighter, but brilliant compared to most
","A little darkness in an already dark field, but Fight Club lets it all hang out.  Don't see it with your parents or a timid girlfriend--do see it with the same people you saw Blade Runner with in high school.  Brad Pitt does what he did best in 12 Monkeys, and Ed Norton & Helena Carter both take a turn for the worst in a stylish way.  You might not like it, but you might not forget it, either.",8,0,1,26 October 1999
Pearl Harbor," Who made this stuff up?
","You'd think that in the decades since 'Tora Tora Tora' (1970) and 'Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo' (1944) that there was room for improvement, maybe a more personal story or a more historically accurate one.  Instead comes this monstrosity, one of the worst war movies, or movies of any kind, I've ever seen.  Not only does it take enormous license with the events at Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Britain and Jimmy Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, but the plot centers on a hackneyed love-triangle plot that was worn out even in the 1940s.  Even the highly touted 'special effects' in this turkey look fake compared to the other films I've mentioned...this film belongs in a class with 'Inchon'.",1,3,6,9 December 2003
Pearl Harbor," One of the silliest war films ever made
","If you can't say something nice... What tripe, full of historical inaccuracies and weak special effects (such as the Oklahoma turning turtle).  It tries to capture the horror of Pearl Harbor with 'Saving Private Ryan' intensity, but only mocks itself.  For the real story, get 'Tora Tora Tora' or Ford's documentary.  For the real feeling, go visit the Arizona in Oahu.",1,0,0,18 June 2001
The Pianist," Great exposition on the horrors of war.
","This film was not what I expected...not really a film about the Holocaust, instead it shows in terrible detail the struggle of one man, obviously privileged and famous, who for all his talent and renown barely survives the occupation of Warsaw by the Germans.  The first movie I've seen which shows something of the Polish resistance.",8,0,1,24 September 2003
Donnie Darko," A Wonderfully Made Film with a Flawed Premise
","I want to say first that I really enjoyed this film...for the first 100 minutes, I thought it was the best I'd seen in years. My problem came with the ending. Although there is more explanation in the director's cut of 'Donnie Darko', it does nothing to change the fact that this is three different films, but the ending picks one (science fiction) and renders the other two possibilities (a religious parable or a film about teenage angst) moot. That said, the acting is great, the writing is sharp, the editing is crisp...one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I understand why many younger people feel so passionately about it. I am a few years older than the director (I graduated high school in 1983) so I also appreciate the generational quality of the film.My problem is, for the first 90 minutes of the film, I thought I was watching a really fantastic film about a young man who might be schizophrenic, with all that entailed for his family and friends. I began to wonder if the religious allegories might be more appropriate. Then, with the ending, it suddenly became nothing more than 'Groundhog Day' or 'Memento'...a better-than-average Twilight Zone 'alternate universe story'. I might have suspected this at the very beginning (when the jet engine should have killed Donnie) but thought this was a leading to something grander than the old 'you have a month to get your life in order' scenario. I really did like it, but I have to give a strong negative for this cheated feeling I had after. This is what always results from a 'deux ex machina', which Donnie actually mumbles at the end, his tormentor's knife at his throat. 'What the f**k did you say?' the bully responds, and I groaned to Mr. Kelly, the director, 'thanks for telling me NOW.' Too bad. My complaints are much more eloquent detailed by Lawrence Person, who reviewed the film for Locus: http://www.locusmag.com/2003/Reviews/Person04_Darko.html",5,2,3,27 June 2008
