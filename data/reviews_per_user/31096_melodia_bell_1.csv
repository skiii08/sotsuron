The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Simply Amazing
","Before heading to the theater, I came here to read some reviews and check the rating so that I would know what to expect. After realizing that it had a very low rating and bad reviews, I started having my doubts. However, after watching the movie, I discovered that I should never judge beforehand. It was a total different experience from what I expected to see. Besides, I was not the only one who was impressed. Nearly all those who were attending felt like the movie went beyond their expectations which honestly was a total surprise given that the previous parts where not so good. I will not say anything except that this installment will deliver and is definitely the best one of all--till now. Do not let the bad reviews here influence you. Do not let the rating scare you away. You go, watch and judge. You will not regret it--I'm just sayin!",10,47,99,17 November 2011
