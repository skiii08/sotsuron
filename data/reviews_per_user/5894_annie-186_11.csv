Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Nice swimwear - NOT!
","My husband and I went to see this last night in part being fans of 'Da Ali G Show' and also carried along with the hype with the marketing campaign. My verdict is that this movie is a somewhat mixed bag of great satire, uncomfortable humour, completely crassness and plain bad taste. Some of the scenes had me laughing hysterically, some shifting uncomfortably but still laughing and some shaking my head as too extreme and bad taste to be funny.The film is extremely creative and original, is well filmed and scripted. It is probably a very good case study on social tolerance and opinion across a broad demographic. The most interesting scene for me was Borat making a guest appearance at a rodeo and the crowd reactions to his speech and then to his singing.It is worth seeing in part for humour, but mostly for social observation. How would you react if confronted with those situations? Plus the image of Borat's swimwear is unforgettable! 6/10",6,2,5,25 November 2006
Kung Fu Panda," Kung Fu Pan-dastic
","This beautifully animated movie has the hallmarks of an enduring classic. Cleverly scripted, it follows the Joseph Campbell 'Hero' formula with several twists of individualistic humour, primarily allowing Jack Black's deliberately stilted story telling style to be relayed in the opening sequence (as witnessed in 'School of Rock' and 'Be Kind, Rewind').The movie pays homage to many Chinese greats including 'Enter the Dragon', 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' plus several early Jackie Chan movies.The animation style is predominantly Dreamworks' own with just a touch of Manga.My children (7 and 3) and I were laughing very early on, usually at different scenes, proving once again that Dreamworks has the formula to appeal across the age demographic.In true Chinese food style, we felt sated when the credits started rolling. Ten minutes after leaving the cinema, we wanted to see it again...My 7 year old son gave it 21/10. I'll settle for a more modest 9/10.",9,2,4,2 July 2008
The Aviator," Heavy going
","Too long, too intense. I had a migraine before the film had finished.Reasonable acting: I especially liked Alan Alda's character. Performances by Cate and Leo were also very good.An interesting biography exploring Hughes early career, it left me wanting to know more about the man.One aspect I enjoyed was the exploration of Hughes' character: his creative genius, his determination and his extraordinary ambition. He blew the lid on what was impossible because to him, if you thought it, you could do it.A bit of trivia: both Hughes and his one-time love Ava Gardner had the same birthday - 24th December.I suspect this film was more 'one for the boys'. My husband loved it.",5,2,4,13 April 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Probably one for the boys
","The premise of this story is simple: a shy, nice guy has managed to get to 40 without losing his virginity. He is not a crass, ugly 'loser' as you might expect, but a sensitive soul who has given up even trying with women. His colleagues find out about his 'condition' and go about trying to rectify it post-haste. The lengths they will go to are incredible.I liked the premise of the story and a lot of the situations the Andy (the virgin) ends up in. I was cackling with laughter through many of them. He is the picture of doe eyed innocence in so many scenes.However, what detracted from the movie was the overuse of unnecessary bad language in the movie. Sometimes the swearing was completely appropriate (e.g. a painful scene with Andy at the beauty parlour which had me in hysterics) but a lot of the time I questioned the artistic or comedic value add. The film was also a little slow to get going.Some great characters added some extra dimensions to the movie. I particularly liked Paula, the store manager and her interactions with Andy, particularly towards the end of the film. The sound track was also fantastic and cleverly woven into the movie.Not one to take your Mother to, but definitely a lot of fun for a boys night out.",6,1,3,13 October 2005
The Incredibles," Hilarious - up there with Toy Story
","Excellent! I hadn't wanted to see this and was badgered into it by my 4 year old son who had already seen it 3 times at the movies.As a true fan of the animated film (I have seen the Lion King 50+ times) this has been the best offering since Shrek.Superb animation, excellent and original story, wonderful children's characters. I particularly liked Edna, the fashion designer. A few conversational gems in there for the adults, including Frozones discussion with his wife.Pixars best effort since Toy Story in terms of overall entertainment.One I won't mind watching again and again on DVD with my son.",9,0,1,13 April 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Simple, yet deep
","I went to see this movie only knowing it was about boxing and that it had won the Oscar for Best Picture for 2004. I was glad I knew nothing else as it made the experience all the better.I very rarely give a film 10/10 - I've only done this 4 times, including this picture, in the last 20 years.The story was simple but strong and very moving. Superb acting with credible characters. The 3 central characters all had depth and were total heart-breakers. Maggie's family were so toxic, it took my breath away.Pure poetry in the script writing. It was an easy film to watch: not overdone or heavy going (like 'The Aviator'). It was wonderful to watch such a fantastic film without a typical Hollywood ending.For me it has touched my heart and made me more strongly appreciate my family. Those Oscars were well deserved.Thank you Clint, Hilary and Morgan. I will reflect on this movie for many years and I'm sure will watch it again and again.",10,6,9,13 April 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Right wing hysteria meets intellectual challenge
","As a British born, Australian dwelling citizen, I only knew a superficial amount of the McCarthy years in the USA. This film was an enlightening and educating experience, prompting me to find out more about this era. The core subject matter  freedom of speech; litigation by due process (c.f. the witch hunts that went on in the McCarthy era)  evokes passion in many and is particularly dear to my heart.I enjoyed this film on many levels. I found it intellectually stimulating, engaging and educational. It was well acted, with a particularly memorable performance by David Strathairn as Ed Murrow, delivering deliciously enunciated readings.It is well scripted, in that it is short and sharp; getting the point across without labouring it and assuming that the audience has a reasonably high level of intelligence.I felt it was appropriately filmed in black and white, which gave added realism to the archive footage shown.One small detail I enjoyed was that it gave a sense of a bygone era. Almost everyone was smoking and at every opportunity, including those on camera during filming of the evening shows. I particularly liked the advert for Kent cigarettes  that was a brand that 'intelligent people' were supposed to smoke! How the world has changed Plus ca change, plus c'est la même chose",9,3,5,22 December 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Sweet without being sickly
","As a huge fan of Roald Dahl, I loved this movie. I was moved to tears on a couple of occasions.I had re-read the book a few days before seeing the movie and was pleased to see that for the most part, this movie was faithful to the book. A few additional creative touches were added, which I felt did not detract from the overall story, but gave fans of the book something additional to enjoy.The acting was excellent, especially from the kids, who lived up to their characters superbly. The sets and colour were fantastic and a good Dahl interpretation from Tim Burton. Johnny Depp was suitably eccentric as Willy Wonka, altogether different from what I had imagined, but nonetheless enjoyable.I did not like the original Gene Wilder movie as I felt it too far removed from the story and too Americanised.One aspect that I found disappointing was the Oompa Loompa songs. The music drowned out Dahl's lyrics, so the lessons we were supposed to be learning from the obnoxious kids were somewhat lost in a mumble.Possibly slightly long for the under 6's but perfect in my book. 8/10",8,3,4,11 September 2005
Pride & Prejudice," A first class adaptation
","This edition of 'Pride and Prejudice' is the truest adaptation I have seen of Jane Austen's famous novel. I was surprised that the movie was made in the reasonably recent wake of the very popular BBC TV mini series with Colin Firth's Darcy, but I'm glad it was.The film, like the series, had awe inspiring landscapes and stately home settings. My favourite was a scene in the Peak District with Keira Knightley just standing on some rocks on a hill. The difference between this version of 'Pride and Prejudice' and the others was the faultless acting. Keira captured Elizabeth Bennett's persona as I had read her: highly intelligent, opinionated and with a strong sense of playful mischief. Matthew MacFadyen had Darcy's arrogance, but also a credible sense of vulnerability which made one believe that Elizabeth could have fallen for him. I was left wondering in other versions how on earth Elizabeth could have any feelings beyond gratitude for Darcy because he still remained very contained. Brenda Blethyn was perfect as the mother: a role very easy to overact as Mrs Bennett's character is so crass.Another aspect I liked about this film is that it truly reflected the family in their status of genteel poverty. They have a lovely home, but it is rather the worse for wear. One thing I had to chuckle at though was the state of the farm. I can't believe that anyone would let their yard get into such a scruffy state, no matter how little money they had! A surprisingly good film. My husband enjoyed it very much also, ergo not your standard period drama for the girls.9/10",9,1,5,27 October 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Espresso cup of flicker
","As a major fan of the Harry Potter books and the first two movies, I have to say that this, like Azkaban disappoints. This movie lacks the energy and enthusiasm of its predecessors.Enormous chunks were cut out of the book, including major characters, sub-plots and parts of the main plot. The bare bones of the book plot were left in and even then there was quite a lot of disconnection. A few new story threads were added to make some sense of the overall story post its radical surgery. There was no understanding of time and pacing through the movie; for example the Quidditch World Cup being held in the summer holidays; the fact that the Triwizard champions were supposed to have one task per term. Other characters were cut back to a cameo at best: Sirius, Snape to name but two. I appreciate that a novel needs editing to take it to the big screen - I loved the treatment of the first two movies - but this seemed like butchery.My other criticisms: 1. what was going on with Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon's) accent? One minute he was from South East England, the next from Yorkshire, the next from Ireland. At one point I thought he was trying to impersonate Richard Harris! 2. Daniel Radcliffe really needs acting lessons. He is getting worse with each movie. He seems to struggle with expressing any subtleties of emotionThings I enjoyed: 1. The special effects are superlative, especially the scenes with the dragon. Harry's interaction with the dragon was excellent: very creative and entertaining. 2. Rupert Grint is getting better and better as Ron, managing more subtle humour with his very expressive face. 3. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort and the whole scene in the graveyard. I felt that this was very true to the spirit of the book and the portrayal was suitably sinister.If you are an avid Potter fan, you still *have* to see this movie. Just don't hope for too much or you may be disappointed.",6,0,0,10 December 2005
The Great Escape," Enduring, must see movie
","Based on historical evidence, this film gives an entertaining account of life in a German prisoner of war camp and a planned 'Great Escape' i.e. all the inhabitants out in one hit.I first saw this film as a young child. It was one of my Dad's favourite movies and stars several of our mutually favourite actors: Charles Bronson, Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough among them. Almost every time this movie came on TV, I felt compelled to watch. I finally bought the movie on DVD and watch it at least once a year.There is very little to dislike about this film. It suits male and female; a huge age range; it contains drama, comedy and plenty of action; the acting is excellent on the whole. The music is fantastic and a suitable tempo and mood throughout. Even knowing the story's outcome, I am still taken through the gamut of emotions each time I watch it.One bit of trivia: apparently Steve McQueen did the majority of his motorbike stunts (although apparently they wouldn't let him do the one at 'the border').",8,1,4,19 December 2005
