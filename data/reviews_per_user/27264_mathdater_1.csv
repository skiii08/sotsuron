Sucker Punch," I liked this movie
","After watching the DVD, I actually felt compelled to go online and check the ages of these girls. I liked the movie but again I felt uncomfortable at times. I liked this movie which is kind of weird because at any moment I felt like the movie might pause itself and Chris Hanson of NBC Datelines ' To Catch a Predator' might appear and ask me, Why did I come here and did I know what was I watching? (humor) well sorta... However, I want to believe the movie was trying to reach the Japanese anime devotees but I felt the message of its genre wasn't clear enough. I gave it a 7 but the Chris Hanson fans might statutorily call it more like 5 to 15.",9,5,8,3 March 2012
