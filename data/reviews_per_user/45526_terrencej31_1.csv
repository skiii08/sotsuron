Hereditary," Wow!!!
","This movie really surprise me in so many ways. Starting with the accident. The movie turns dark so fast after. The writer took little key elements from different horror movies. It felt a little like The Last Exorcism, It Follows with a touch of The Witch. The acting was absolutely on par with the exception of the oldest child. But it does not take away from the movie. Definitely a surprise at the end of the film. This movie did not get any hype and exceeded expectations.",10,12,22,1 September 2018
