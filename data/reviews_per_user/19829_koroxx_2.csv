The Avengers," Casual blockbuster
","I'm not really into superheroes movies (however I really enjoyed Batman trilogy of Nolan), nor into comics. But people around me were talking so much about how cool 'The Avengers' was that I decided to buy the Blu ray 3D and give it a try. And... It was a big disappointment ! OK it's entertaining, it's a blockbuster with a lot of budget and special effect and action, but the story is casual and predictable, same thing for the characters ! I really don't get how people could have been so excited for something like that...The worst part ? If a movie so casual has that much success, the directors of the sequels won't make any effort to make a better work on the story... The second Avengers movie did confirms that, it was even worse (but apparently a lot of cuts where made because it was too long otherwise, maybe the DVD/BR version will be a little better).Of course not all the Marvel movies are like that fortunately ! I'm open minded and I love cinema so I did try some other stuff the Marvel studios made, so I can highly recommend 'Guardians of the Galaxy' (I loved it) and the 'Ant Man' that was nice too. The other Marvel movies ? Well, let just say that if you don't watch them you don't miss a lot...",5,4,8,1 September 2015
Ready Player One," Not as good as the book, but a very good movie anyways!
","Spielberg give us a very good movie, full of geeky references - video games, comics, movies (fans of horror movies too will be thrilled) - and more than that, a very good sci-fi movies.All the geeky stuff shown in the trailers are far to be the most important part of this movie. The overall universe is interesting (real world too, not only the Oasis).Being fan of the book, I'm not happy with all the changes made (the first trial to get the first key is now a deadly race, and some characters killed in the books survive in the movie). BUT there is some nice ideas too (The second trial, genius).
And of course they scraped some geeky japanese references that 90% of people won't have understand, but fortunately they kept some of the most famous ones, which brings us an awsome fight!Good job Spielberg, 71years old but still making very good movies for the young audience, way better than most of the blockbusters we see nowadays.",7,25,63,26 March 2018
