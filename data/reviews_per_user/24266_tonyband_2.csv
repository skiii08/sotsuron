Alien 3," Beautifully Bleak Underrated Masterpiece
","Your ass is already on the line. The only question is, what're you gonna do about it? - Ripley Following the escape from the Alien planet, Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver - Ghostbusters II) ship comes crashing down on to a maximum security facility killing Newt, Hicks and Bishop leaving her as the sole survivor. Being the only women in an all male secure facility causes issues but nothing compared to when she learns that there was an Alien aboard her ship and that her crash on the planet may not be the accident she first thought. But that is not Ripley's only problem as she once more has to take battle to the Alien but this time without any weapons to use.'Alien' was brilliant and 'Aliens' was its equal if not better, bucking the trend of sequels usually being poor, but then came 'Alien 3' and simply its a dark masterpiece that takes liberties and risks rather than make it more action blockbuster, it goes for a Gothic tone of pure darkness.it's a good movie and the acting is still first rate and in many ways is the best thing about this third Alien movie.Sigourney Weaver once more creates this powerful woman in Ripley but at the same time gives her insecurities making her fascinating to watch especially when she basically flips the switch and takes the battle to the Alien. And whilst Weaver is the star of 'Alien 3' the supporting performances which includes Charles Dance, Charles S. Dutton, Brian Glover and Pete Postlethwaite do not disappoint, creating interesting characters that whilst may not get a lot of screen time are more than just cardboard cut outs.A iconic climax, all things considered, combining a clever plan, high action, an unexpected twist, and a couple of keen visuals. See the directors cut to appreciate its vision.",10,4,7,1 February 2016
Batman Returns," Batman Returns captures the comic hero's manic depressive state of mind as well as the comic book's Gothic intentions.
","BATMAN RETURNS: As the pitiful, orphaned psychopathic freak the Penguin and the power-hungry capitalist villain Max Schreck (named after the actor who played Nosferatu) plot to gain domination over Gotham City, the Caped Crusader battles an equally fatal distraction... Cat Woman. The discussion topics - in Batman Returns An argument could be made for the value of mental health counselling: All masked characters in the film are presented as emotionally dysfunctional.Batman, director Tim Burton was given free rein with its sequel. Batman Returns is more malignant in its style, atmosphere and feeling. Without a doubt Batman Returns will remain the best movie in the series.Batman Returns was unlike any other film I'd experienced. If I had to think of four words that night to describe it, I'd have chosenBleak The wintry setting made the theater's air-conditioning that much colder.Raw Like chapped winter skin, the character's emotions envelop you in a sheath of exposed nerve endings.Vulnerable From the opening sequence to the final credits, there's an overwhelming sense of sadness that permeates nearly every frame.Personal I'd never felt such empathy for heroes and villains alike. There are no winners here. Even in victory, there is loss.Whereas other comic book films—X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spider-man—have taken the explosive, CGI, Jerry Bruckheimer route, Batman Returns is subtle, grounded, and real. Batman is a human consumed by the desire for justice. He has no super-human abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Batman's arsenal is made up of exceptional observation skills, a sharp intellect, finely honed physical skills, and the innate ability to emotionally detach from a stressful situation. Burton exploits this humanity as the foundation upon which the film is built.The true power of Batman Returns is found in the character relationshipsBefore Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins, Batman Returns was the crown jewel in this hero's filmatic crown. Even now, it stands the test of time as one of Tim Burton's finest films and a character drama all comic book adaptations should aspire to. If you haven't seen it, now's the time.",10,1,5,1 February 2016
