Despicable Me 2," Gru as a good guy and nasty purple Minions!
","People are split between loving it and hating it. It's great fun but nothing like the first one! Gru is a loving father to three 'nauseatingly cute' little girls but you love 'em anyway! Even funnier even than the new 'Minions Movie'! Gru dresses up as the Drag Queen Fairy Godmother of all time when no one shows up at the girl's birthday party. His evil scientist assistant can't stand making bad-tasting jelly so he jumps ship to serve another villain that (yawn) wants to conquer the world. (Still a popular movie subject--look at the new Star Wars) It makes fun of Mexicans, Mexican food, tacky malls and trendy food courts. A send up of 'Get Smart', 'Gremlins' and 'The Hulk'. It certainly isn't politically correct. The antidote to the purple monster-making-goo is Gru's sticky bad tasting red jelly! Too much fun with impossible gimmicks and gadgets, and incredible stylized computer animation. Steve Carrell has a job for life! The 'fat' CEO of 'The Bank of Evil' makes a guest appearance. So does the family 'dog' and Gru's Mama. What can they possibly do in next year's second sequel? I can't wait to find out...",10,1,2,13 April 2016
The Mask," Strill Amazing After 20 Years!
","Cameron Diaz (Tina) and Max the Dog (Milo) steal this picture out from under from Jim Carey, who plays 'The Mask'! 'Tina' was supposed to be a just a live-action 'Jessica Rabbit' but she is sexy, cute, funny and smart, and can she dance! Yes, she is the proverbial 'girl with the heart-of-gold' but so much more. 'Max', I hope, won some kind of animal 'Oscar' as the tricks he does are truly amazing. The story of 'Loki's Mask' is very simple. Put on the mask and you become just like yourself only more so. If you are shy and romantic (like 'Stanley') you become a super-hero 'Ricky Ricardo' impervious to bullets and bullies. If you are an evil monster through-and-through (Like Dorian) you become the devil incarnate. Fantastic CGI from ILM and a long way from the primitive CGI used in 'Jumanji'. The Mask turns into the girl-loving 'Wolf' and several other Tex Avery cartoon characters. Bullets can't kill him. He can leap from buildings, dodge bullets and swallow bombs like Superman. In one of the best scenes, Carey becomes 'Cuban Pete'. Wearing only the green mask, he orchestrates an entire Conga-line dance number with Edge City's Police on his own without much help (if any) from ILM. It's amazing to see. There is a cruel edge to the action, as several thugs are blown away by gunfire in various scenes. Thankfully, also cut, was the Tribune newsgirl's demise (See DVD extras) which wasn't funny at all, but was in early release prints. Fictitious Edge City is only a step away from Gotham City and very 'campy' indeed: The giant piggy bank and costumes at the nightclub. Landfill Park, complete with colorful methane gas clouds. Another milestone: It's the first-action comedy from New Line Cinema, which, previous to this, only made 'Nightmare on Elm Street' horror films. It's a '9', rated-down due to comic violence.",9,0,0,26 January 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Too much of the same with a very confusing plot-But still fun!
","I had to see this one twice in order to fully comprehend it. Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz run away with the film as Jack Sparrow and Angelica, Jack's soul-mate and perfect foil. Great chemistry between the two characters. In fact, she almost outshines Johnny Depp (Jack). On cable with commercials, the film seems to go on forever. What makes the plot so confusing is that Blackbeard and Edward Teague look very similar because both have flowing gray beards. One of the pirates (Barbossa) has a peg leg, so he is more easily singled out. The plot is a jumbled mess of the supernatural,voodoo, zombies and other undead, magical powers, the Fountain of Youth, English and Spanish explorers, and so many swashbuckling sequences that it made my head spin. Want a plot summary? Read it elsewhere as there are over 400 other reviews and a great Wikipedia summary as well. Did I enjoy it? yes. The romance between the Evangelist Philip and the 'good' mermaid, nicknamed 'Syrena', was haunting but almost unnecessary to the story. How she is going to rescue her dying love is unclear, as the mermaids here have a 'taste' for human flesh. She drags him under the sea not to drown him, but to save him. This is never explained. Conquistador Ponce De Leon stops by to destroy the Fountain of Youth, as 'only God can grant eternal life'. Angelica and Blackbeard, both mortally wounded by a poison-laced sword, drink the fountain waters from silver chalices. Angelica lives and Blackbeard dies a horrible death and is turned into a skeleton. A mermaid tear in the magic water makes all the difference! So many questions here. The mermaid's rescue, as mentioned earlier. Jack's ship, The Black Pearl, is bewitched and miniaturized as a ship in a bottle. How to enlarge it, using mumbo-jumbo black magic? Will Angelica ever be rescued from the tiny island where Jack marooned her? Jack's Voodoo doll washes ashore and she picks it up. Fade to black. To be continued? This movie gave me a headache. An '8' because I enjoyed it in spite of itself. Alas, too many plot holes and shortcomings, me matey. Keep yer eye peeled for yet another sequel in 2015? 'Argh!'",8,0,1,21 May 2014
Men in Black 3," An original sequel with great performances by all
","A worthy sequel in the series, but nothing beats the ground-breaking first MIB movie! With obvious homage to both 'Back to the Future' and the 'Mad Max' movies, it has big shoes to fill. James Brolin as the young 'K' is absolutely amazing. More of the same with a twist, of course: There's always a monstrous alien villain who wants to conquer the universe. But this time, it's personal. 'Boris The Animal' wants revenge. 'K' shot off his left arm and Boris was imprisoned on the Moon for 40 years. But Boris also killed 'K' some 40 years ago! To restore K's life, Agent 'J' must go 'back in time' to fix everything. So, he 'time jumps' (literally) off a tall NYC skyscraper using a banned alien gadget and 'lands' in 1969 before all these things ever happened. Fantastic CGI, as always. Like 'Sky Captain', made a few years ago, almost everything is blue screen fabricated, including most of Cape Canaveral. Boris is a real motorcycle riding meanie. He kills his victims by shooting his poisonous quills into their foreheads. A hideous 'crab creature' emerges from his sweaty palm to do his evil biding. It's very creepy and intense. It has a great retro 1969 'atmosphere' with all the right costumes, props,and scenery you would expect from a first-class production. In order to save the Earth, a protective radar 'Sky-Net' has to be launched from an Apollo booster rocket and Boris must be killed this time instead of just captured. A great movie to be sure, but it doesn't seem to have enough aliens in it, for my taste. Definitely worth watching and worth owning. I hope it's a series re-launch.(Will there be a MIB 4?) A surprising and heartwarming ending that fully explains why MIB Agents 'J' and 'K' work so well together.",9,0,1,1 August 2013
Gremlins," A Devil of a good time but not for children!
","'Mowgli' means devil. Do not water of feed this cute little creature nicknamed 'Gizmo' after midnight (EST) or it spawns nightmarish reptilian-mischievous creatures capable of violence and murder. Like all great movie monsters, the rules are simple and these things multiple like crazy. One particularly nasty one is named 'Stripe' and almost kills Gizmo's new owner at the climax as Gizmo comes to the rescue. Many famous nightmarish scenes already well-known including a Gremlin exploding in a microwave and the creatures singing along to 'High Ho' during a screening of Disney's 'Snow White' at the local movie theater. Praised for it's originality and satire but disliked for it's mean-spirited demeanor and nasty, deadly tricks played on unsuspecting humans. Originally billed as a comedy, many parents left with their screaming traumatized children as it turned meaner. Fantastically successful, it spawned a really annoying sequel 6 years later in 1990. A guilty pleasure, to be sure!",9,1,2,5 December 2018
The Incredible Hulk," A Nightmare Inducing Movie
","Let's start out by saying that I do not like either 'Hulk' movie. Also, I haven't seen the 'Avengers' yet so I can't address the Hulk's role in that film.The first Hulk movie had very bad CGI. It was like watching a live action film with animated inserts. In the first movie the Hulk turns into an 'Atomic Bomb'. They should have left him dead. But, like Frankenstein's monster, he had to be resurrected. Anyway, in Hulk #2 (The Search for More Money), his new nemesis is a nightmarish 'lobster-man' that upset me so that I haven't viewed this film in a long time. I am not a coward when it comes to these kinds of films. I have seen: all the original 'Nightmares on Elm St.', 'Jaws', 'Alien' Series and 'Hellraiser' flicks. However, I choose not to watch most of these films ever again. I don't find these films enjoyable. Other films with nightmarish qualities that I do like include 'Van Helsing' and 'What Dreams May Come'. Also, some of the Harry Potter series. But I tend to like sci-fi not sci-fi-shock movies. I'm not into vampires or werewolves these days, although in my youth, I loved them. Your tastes change as you get older and I am over 50. I liked the green guy better when he wasn't quite so tall and wasn't fighting crustaceans. A new TV series would be better than the next Hulk movie which is planned for 2014. Also, a curvaceous 'she-hulk' would liven up things quite a bit, don't you think?",7,0,0,28 January 2013
The Sound of Music," A perfect Musical Film that is practically a work of fiction!
","The cinematography, set design, costumes , choreography, vocal performances are almost perfection! Critics said that Christopher Plummer's 'Capt. Von Trapp' was a weak performance, but he was given a very difficult character role to portray, from a heartsick, callus, widower to a loving father in a short period of time. As history, it is very poor indeed. He actually was a very good father who loved his children dearly. The major events (marriage, romance, escape) are out-of-order and highly fictionalized. However, they did perform in several wartime-concerts and won awards. Also, the Captain was 'drafted' for Hitler's submarine fleet. All the children's real names were different. Alas, the true events would not have made an enjoyable musical. Postulate Maria was originally given the task to tutor one child recovering from the scarlet fever, that killed her mother. The character 'Max' did not exist. Instead, there was a musically-talented Catholic Priest that came with them. Then, a U.S. talent agency almost drove them into bankruptcy. I do agree with one thing that the critics 'said': the portrayal of The Nazis was far too nice. No distributor caps were removed by the nuns at the Abby. All that was 'made up'. The Von Trapp family just took the train (that passed behind their house) to Italy and never hiked up the Swiss Alps, which were nowhere near them. Eventually, they took a steamship to America. The musical score is also a vast improvement with the deletion of two terrible songs from the Broadway version, and the addition of 2 wonderful new songs entirely written by Rogers for the movie: 'I Have Confidence' and 'Something Good'. It may be the most successfully-produced musical of all time, with numerous audio, visual, TV, film and Broadway versions and revivals internationally! If you can ever see this on a big screen, the Oscar-winning cinematography is breathtaking.If you are curious about the true story, Look for 'The Story of the Trapp Family Singers' by Maria Augusta Trapp, (Doubleday & Co. 1949) if it is still available.",10,0,1,16 December 2019
Ghost," Ghost combines both horror and love. Truly haunting
","This was, years ago, my wife's favorite Patrick Swayze film until he actually died. Now she refuses to watch it. Basically, it's a very moralistic story about an unfinished life cut short and revenge following death, at the hands of the ghost that was murdered. Somewhat inconsistent, especially when he meets up with the 'subway ghost' who is a truly disturbing character. Whoopie Goldberg runs away with an 'Oscar winning' performance as the reluctant medium. She injects much humor into an otherwise humorousness movie which is quite terrifying at times and quite graphic as well. The 'pottery wheel' love scene is famous but also infamous as producer Jerry Zucker mocks it in one of his own 'Naked Gun' movies. Great and bad CGI abound, as ILM gets the Heavenly scenes right but bungles the 'Devilish takedown' of the two villains: the white-collar embezzler and the drugged-up, stupid murderer. The 'soul-sucking' evil spirits just don't seem convincing enough. Today, a movie about computers, stolen identity, and off-shore bank accounts is old hat, but it was fresh in 1990. The film is therefore uneven, but fascinating just the same. It's a one-of-a-kind film that can never be repeated. Not quite 'Hitchcockian', but worth your time at least once. Warning: Bloody at times. Not for the squeamish.",8,1,1,20 March 2014
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," One of the most successful and best fantasy films of all time
","A recent Yahoo article stated that my VHS green laser-stamped copy might be worth $2000? How silly! Dozens of VHS copies are currently on the Internet for under $20! 75 million copies were sold the first year and mine shows only a slight amount of wear. Disc copies, likewise, are under $20. I have an original VHS release which shows the doctors wearing guns, not CGI replaced Walkie-Talkies . A great fantasy with so many terrific performances. Drew Barrymore is the best. E.T. camouflaged in the closet with the other stuffed toys is my favorite scene, or is it flying on a bicycle over the moon, on the final parting ('I'll be right here'). I can't decide. Reese's Pieces were used to follow the trail in the woods and M&M-Mars regrets it to this day. Magical, mild and wonderful to behold. I can't wait to show it to my grand-kids who have never seen it!Note: Most clam-shell Disney VHS tapes are worth about $20 and some might be worth $100 at the most.",10,2,2,21 May 2019
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An Amazing Hybrid of live action and animation but not perfect
","To get the various copyright owners to agree to the use of their characters and especially WB and Disney to work together was truly amazing. Note that Terrytoons, Superman, Tom & Jerry, Casper and Wendy are MIA. Most of the film is very clever, including the dropping of a safe and a piano as murder weapons, as Tex Avery and Looney Tunes might do. Jessica Rabbit was drawn without underwear? Daffy Duck swears at Mickey Mouse? Both are somewhat true, as animators can be quite mischievous. I dislike 'Dr. Doom' and his 'final solution' for Toons reminds me of something 'Uncle Adolf' might do. It's cruel and almost ruins the tone of the movie. However the 'dip dispensing' fire hose truck and steam roller is an amazing prop, having seen it at WDW a very long time ago when there it was called the Disney-MGM Studios theme park. Therefore, I can state that I hate the 'end' of Dr. Doom, but basically love (most of) the rest of the movie.",10,2,3,28 October 2018
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Almost a 10. A family favorite.
","Cruella is one of the best Disney villains and wonderfully drawn. If I could just 'cut-out' the short scene where she slaps the two bumbling robbers and once again tells them to 'Kill' those puppies. Otherwise, a joy to behold. No actual violence in the movie and several memorable scenes: The twilight bark. The black Labradors piling into the truck. Pongo considers his owner to be his 'pet' human. Far superior to the (much) later live-action versions. Wonderful talking animals with outstanding voice casting. Stylized animation with simpler backgrounds and no shadows, but still very well animated. A family favorite to this very day. We always watch it with our dog beside us.",9,0,0,7 May 2020
Gravity," Best Depiction of space travel since '2010'.
","Not for everyone and very intense. No BEM (bug-eyed-monster) or alien. Death and fear are the monsters here. She is a 'tenderfoot' astronaut and has to read the plastic cue cards to operate the equipment. She goes in-and-out of consciousness and imagines that her dead partner, 'Kowalski' (George Clooney) returns and saves her. In fact he does, as his hallucination helps her focus on her own rescue. Everything goes wrong after a failed repair of the Hubble telescope, and she becomes the lone survivor from the USA team. The Hubble gets destroyed by space debris, and so does her spacecraft. I actually felt like I was ridding along with her. Everything was so real and vivid yet some reviewers thought it to be long, boring and meaningless? She makes a final leap-of-faith and 'jumps' to the rescue spacecraft-capsule, which almost burns up on re-entry. It's only 90 minutes so try to see it uncut. (With 30 minutes of cable commercials, it does drag.) Warning! viewing it on a large screen/3D/IMAX might cause vertigo!",10,6,9,4 July 2016
To Be or Not to Be," A True Classic in Every Respect. Yes, Jack Benny Can Act!
","I ran into this little film on TCM and spent a good hour finding a reasonably-priced copy on the Internet (WB-2005 slightly used). The Mel Brooks 1983 remake is not as good as the Lubitch 1942 original. A poor Jewish thespian troupe in Poland struggles to continue it's meager livelihood by producing plays, but The Nazis take over Poland and blow up the entire neighborhood. A brilliant mixture of comedy, satire, and melodrama which includes a love triangle between 'ham' actor Josef Tura (Jack Benny) his actress wife Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) and a Polish RAF flier (Robert Stack). The classic line: 'Tura is doing on stage what Hitler is doing to Poland'. Throw in a fanatically-crazy Nazi spy, stupid, bumbling Germans and a bit of cloak-and-dagger action and you have quite a unique production. Probably the inspiration for 'Hogan's Heroes' decades later. While the real Hitler is waiting for the play to begin, the fake Hitler causes a riot, and the entire madcap cast hijacks the 'Fuhrer's' car and airplane and escapes to Scotland. It's both a screwball comedy and a serious comment on the Nazi menace, as it was filmed in 1941, during the war. For the full (and complicated) plot synopsis, go to TCM.com and 'Google' the title. Jack Benny plays his finest movie role of all time and it is Carole Lombard's last film, as she died tragically two months later in an airplane crash near Las Vegas. The running gag: Every time Tura (Jack Benny) recites Hamlet's famous 'To Be or Not To Be' soliloquy, somebody in the audience gets up and leaves.",10,1,3,24 January 2014
Citizen Kane," Highly Over-rated, Like Gone With the Wind
","Citizen Kane is the fictionalized story of William Randolph Hearst, right down to the inherited mine. It is a fascinating yet overly-long film that, just like GWTW, bogs down during it's last half. Too much time is spent on his 2nd wife, a singer of very limited talent, who ultimately leads to the destruction of Kane's life and happiness. Except for the fact that she is a beautiful woman, she is shallow and boring, and I care very little for her life story, which dominates far too much time in this movie. Although Kane wins the governorship, it is curious that very little time is shown with him doing anything while in office. A sterling cast, with Agnes Moorehead playing his first wife, and Joseph Cotten as the chief narrator. Orson himself is a wonderful actor. His aging makeup, while clumsy at times, is remarkably accurate. The movie is at its best when telling the story of Kane's rise to newspaper power as the king of 'yellow journalism'. The photography is outstanding, and it makes full use of what was then-called 'deep focus' with the entire frame from front to back, sharp as a tack. The simulated newsreel footage is outstanding, as is the musical score by Bernard Hermann. Wonderful sets and masterful miniatures and mattes. However, tedious to watch, as I found myself unable to enjoy it in one sitting, almost falling asleep! It's too much like a good murder mystery. Once you know that 'Rosebud' refers to his childhood wooden sled, which was his beloved possession before he became rich and was sent off to an Eastern boarding school, the movie does not require repeated viewing. Once is enough, for me!",8,0,1,28 June 2014
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Star Wars, Nothing But Star Wars. The Search for More Money.
","I didn't like it. Quite unoriginal and obviously for the current young fans. Let's see: 1. Another ominous hidden holographic message. 2. Another plucky young woman similar to Princess Leia except she's not royalty. 3. A really nice robot this time. That's an improvement. 4. Lot's of hand-to-hand combat and mystic alien Kung-Fu. 5. We already knew about 'the weakness' in the Death Star. It's old news. 6. It's almost like the 'Millennium Falcon' once again. 7. Darth Vader yet again. Peter Cushing brought to life, digitally. Again. 8. OK as 'Cable Fodder' but can't beat Episodes 4-6 after decades of trying. 9. Of course most of the EFX are better, but some of them look washed out and fake. 10. More violent than ever. 11. 'Bambi Syndrome' Mom dies first. Dad dies later. 12. An unnecessary prequel and a depressing ending. Walt Disney would turn over in his grave, Force or no Force.Yawn. I'm not impressed at all. I only rate it an '8' out of respect for George Lucas. I rate it a 2 for it's total lack of originality, and that's being generous. Except for a few minor twists, I already knew the ending 40 minutes before it finished.",8,1,8,31 July 2017
Captain Marvel," Confusing storyline
","It plays like an entry in the new Star Trek Series. Uneven. Good but could have been better. Spends a lot of time telling the origin of her life. A very comic book-like plot. Just who the good or bad aliens are is at first a mystery and then reversed. A CGI cat that is really an alien with an attitude. How dumb! Like many Marvel Movies there is a lot of action but the character of 'Carol Danvers' remains an enigma and too Supergirl-like. The alien power source is small like that in Supergirl (1984) and one of the aliens eats it for safekeeping! Very violent, hence the PG-13 rating. The last half-hour finally lives up to the 'hype' about the movie, when I had almost given up on it. Worth seeing again. My 10 year old grandson loves it. Is that the intended target audience here?",8,1,7,13 August 2019
Iron Man 2," A Noisey Sequel Long On Action Short on Thought
","First of all, I tried to watch this on cable channel FX which blew it up to a 3 hr. presentation with far too many 'extras' and commercials. (It's only a 2 hour movie.) Tony Stark believes he has achieved 'World Peace' thru the creation of 'Iron Man' so naturally there has to be a loose cannon; crazy Russian 'Vanko' (played to the hilt by Mickey O'Rourke) who thinks Stark's dad stole the design from his dad. So the motive is revenge. Are you confused yet? So many things going on. Stark is dying from radioactive poisoning. The government wants to create the ultimate drone soldier and a competing corporation wants to steal the contract from Stark Industries. It plays a little like 'Short Circuit' meets 'Robocop 2' with a dash of tin-can 'Cylons' mixed in. Very cartoonish, which, of course, leads to a wonderful mindless climax with dozens of exploding evil drones and tons of action. (Kids ages 6 to 12 will love it.) People running for their lives from a set that looks like Epcot's 'World Showcase' but isn't. The best sequence occurs far earlier in the film at a Monte Carlo race from Hell with race cars sliced in two by 'Vanko' with his pulsating 'laser whip'. It all left me with a big headache. Scarlett Johansson, as 'Black Widow/Natasha' 'kicks butt' and she has better moves than the Iron Men. (Yes, there are 2 Iron Men plus villain makes 3.) Like all the bad sequels after the original 'Superman', it's overblown and sort of a waste of time. In general, I didn't like it, but 'Natasha' is amazing in her beyond skin-tight cat suit. Wow!",7,2,6,7 June 2013
Passengers," A Sci-Fi and Romance Mix with Impresive CGI Effects!
","I wish I had seen this on a bigger screen. Movie critics also panned 'John Carter' which was a great movie as well. It is so obvious that many of the professional critics are not Sci-Fi fans, by the way they battered a very likable film. A bit like 'When World's Collide' and 'Titanic in Space'. It's a little predictable and implausible as well. One passenger on a journey to a new world wakes up 89 years too soon, when his suspended animation pod 'blows a fuse'. Judging on all the skills he has knowledge of, he's not a mechanical engineer, he's 'Scotty' or 'Spock' from Star Trek! He wakes up another passenger on purpose as he appears to need good-looking female companionship and stimulation. The first half of the film is a bit slow, but the 'space walk' and tour of the ship is fascinating. It's certainly a lot better-paced than the slow motion reveal in Star Trek I. In hour 2, everything falls apart including the space ship's power core. First their love affair freezes over when she discovers that he woke her up. One crew member wakes up, just long enough before dying to keep the spaceship 'afloat'. Then as the power core overheats, the power fails, they both turn into 'Astronauts' and go outside the ship to unjam a stuck emergency vent and each other. He should have died, but she revives him using the super-dooper DIY medical machine. (Really!) Also, why isn't he burned (or radioactive) from the engine breach? Why it works for us space movie 'nuts': Great CGI. When all gravity fails, the swimming pool rises up and turns into an (almost) death trap. It's enjoyable and exciting and has a pleasant (yes, predictable) happy ending. On my 'Starz' version the slight nudity might be cable-edited?",10,3,4,23 September 2017
12 Monkeys," Brilliant, redundant, violent, thoughtful, confusing, but not enjoyable!
","Like most time traveler movies, there are several paradoxes where the traveler literally 'meets himself coming and going'. Some are in the form of flashbacks and flash-forwards. An old picture from a World War One history book. The feeling (by several characters) that they have 'been there' before. Like 'Kpax' the 'hero' (Bruce Willis) is thought insane, so much so that he begins to doubt his own sanity. He is from the future but has no gadgets and arrives almost naked. He is yanked back and forth through time and is 'volunteered' to try and stop a madman from releasing a plague that destroys 90% of the Earth's population. It's haunting, but not really enjoyable as we all know that 'you can't change the future', or so we are told. He witnesses his own death though the eyes of a child is the only 'clue' I will give you. I didn't really like it. Rated up as '8' due to apocalyptic views of the future, with great set decoration.",8,1,1,21 February 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," It's Great but hard-to follow
","No movie is perfect, hence the '9'. If you want the complete storyline, read one of the other 700 reviews. (I really miss Roger Ebert.)This review is all about an impression of the movie from an avid Star Trek fan.It's one of the best 'Star Trek' films ever made. More action at breakneck speed and more killer EFX than several old Star Trek movies combined. Never a dull moment, although somewhat hard to follow. The CGI is flawless and everything looks real. Spock is a lot more 'human' and Kirk acts like the school-boy we always knew he was. Carol Markus is amazing (and cut!) and what about those cat-aliens in bed? (At least they're not green.) Lots of humor. Plot holes abound: How was Khan planing on getting those 'Human Popsicles' out of the missiles before they all exploded? Why is Khan the only revived superhuman? Why isn't Christopher Pike in a wheelchair? The director provides very little plot exposition about the main characters and assumes you already know everybody. This is both good and bad, but it saves 15 minutes of time, and that's good. As always, there are hundreds of crew members, but you only see a few of them except when the ship is being blown-up in a great 'dogfight' between starships, in space. I love the alien with the 'glass brain' in his head! A lot of twists on the old 'Star Trek 2' plot. Some familiar lines reused (good). In this version, Kirk takes the massive fatal radiation dosage instead of Spock.(O.K.) The way he is revived and cured, with magic 'Khan' blood via a Tribble, is hokey; but he can't die so early in the series, can he? In this version, Khan is almost a 'Superman'; he's invulnerable, but can't fly. Spock is stronger too, as he chases Khan thru the skies in a fight on what looks like airborne 'garbage trucks'. Please get rid of 'Scotty's annoying alien sidekick'. A far better film than several 'weak' ones in the original series. (Stay away from whales.) Please, Paramount, reopen a new 'Star Trek' museum, at a major theme park!",9,3,6,15 June 2013
The Fifth Element," Makes fun of several sci-fi classics-Campier than Flash Gordon!
","Weird blue aliens? Pigs with machine guns? Bombs everywhere in plain sight? Stupid authority figures? Dumb villains? Good special effects? Entirely 'tongue-in-cheek'. The product of a teenager's imagination? Yeah, it's all that and much more. Bruce Willis is the macho cab driver from the 23rd Century who wins a trip on the most luxurious cruising space ship in the universe. (Like Las Vegas in space.) Chris Tucker plays the gayest newsman of all time and is entirely in drag throughout. It mimics everything from 'Star Wars to Last Starfighter'. A blue singing diva with hidden compartments inside her. What a weird story. Space travelers stop at the Pyramids in 1914 to pick up the 'luggage'. The four elements of earth, wind, fire, and water. They will be needed again in the 23 Century to save the Earth from a killer asteroid. The dumb villain wants to rule the Universe but he has to find the Fifth Element, who is 'Leeloo'. She is 'Pure Love', played by Milla Jovovich with red-ragdoll hair! Wearing very skin-tight clothes and, she looks androgynous. She 'kicks-ass' like 'Catwoman'! Confused? You will be. Fun and very violently silly at the same time. So bad it looks like a 'Carolco' production with Bruce Willis subbing for Big Arnold. I should hate it, but I don't!",8,0,1,23 May 2016
Batman Returns," Catwoman Begins and Steals Batman's Heart
","Perhaps the darkest of the 4 Batman movies (in this series). There is much to like and dislike here. Michelle Pfeiffer is 'purr-fect' as Catwoman and owns this movie. Too bad it isn't more about her and less about The Penguin. Danny DeVito plays a nasty, mean-spirited bird, and while the character is well-executed, it drags down the film to an almost depressing level. Curiously, in this one, no one goes to a cell in Arkham Asylum. Not enough gadgets in this one, although the penguins, which are both very real and clever fabrications, are very well-done. If this didn't win something for special effects, it should have. Max Shreck (Walken) is a weak co-villain, but, as always, he plays his part very well as the evil-greedy Capitalist. More grim and graphic than the last two Batman movies (in this series). Children were seen crying, leaving the theater. I wish the film had been more about Batman and Catwoman, don't you? They need to use her in further adventures. (That Halle Berry Catwoman movie was a big disappointment.) I nominate Scarlet Johannson for the role. Catwoman, of course, does not die, even though she was shot several times. Why is that? Nine lives?",7,0,1,26 October 2013
The Mummy," No need for a 2017 series reboot
","An incredible film that manages to outdo the 1932 Boris Karloff classic. It is pretty gory by my standards, as The Mummy rebuilds his body piece-by-piece and organ-by organ. Then there is the outstanding 'early' unforgettable CGI such as The Mummy 'howling' during a sandstorm of his own creation. They 'sort-of' copy this for the new version. More plagues than even Moses had in his 'bag of tricks'. Finally, it settles down into a very decent swashbuckling Indiana Jones 'knock-off-type' movie with no apologies for stealing that premise. Great and necessary female 'sidekick'. I actually enjoyed 'The Mummy Returns' sequel far more as it is not as gory. The first entry is not for the squeamish. Almost a classic and I don't see the need for a reboot in 2017 by anybody. I feel like watching it right now as it is 98 degrees outside and that's just about right for a Lazy Summer Popcorn Movie! I expect I will eventually see the 'new' version as well, as it looks pretty-good from the previews.",9,0,0,12 June 2017
The Others," A Different Kind of Ghost Story
","A tale of mystery, not horror. This is one of the best performances that Nichole Kidman has ever done. A ghost story of the highest caliber; but if you watch it too carefully, there are so many 'clues' that you will guess the ending long before the final reel. For another version (a similar story) watch 'The Innocents' (1961). The story seems familiar because it is a partial retelling of 'The Turn of the Screw.' I won't reveal the ending except to tell you that this is a ghost story told from the ghosts' point-of-view, which really reveals too much. (The young boy Victor, one of the 'intruders', can see the ghosts.) A handsome production with excellent cinematography and sets. Well directed and very atmospheric but too intense for very young children. The movie mystery starts out with a few huge hints: The mannerisms and dress of the servants. The children are very 'photo-sensitive' to sunlight. Not as much fun on additional viewings, once the viewer knows the secret of 'the Others'.",8,0,1,1 July 2012
Home Alone," A John Hughes/Chris Columbus Masterpiece!
","The basic story seems so simple. Little 8-yr. old Kevin is accidentally left behind when his family jets off to Paris for Christmas. So it's 'riddled' with continuity errors and plot holes. The garage has a separate entrance but is somehow connected to the main house? (Who cares.) There are so many things going on here. It's an incredibly complex screenplay, which pays homage to so many other movies: The burned brass hand-scar ('Raiders of the Lost Ark') The Three Stooges (impossible stunts and injuries that would have killed any mortal man.) 'Angels with Filthy Souls' is a parody of 'Angels with Dirty Faces'. Clips from several Christmas movies. Sure it's totally implausible that an 8-year-old boy could actually execute such complicated stunts, but the 'Micro-Machines' (actually candy) are genius, as is the zip line to the treehouse. It's Maculay Culkin's best performance. John Candy plays a great cameo as the Polka King and the sub-plot of 'Old Man Marley' and his grandchild add much 'heart' to the film. There are so many scenes that I love, but the toboggan out the front door and the stinging after shave lotion are the best. I love Buzz's tarantula and the blood-curdling scream (dubbed) from Daniel Stern! (The tarantula on Marv's face is considerably smaller than the one used in other scenes?) A great score by John Williams with some dusty 1950's carols thrown in for good measure. Of course this whole thing could never really happen. The whole movie is a fantasy, but the dream house that the McCallister's 'live' in is real! Also, magically, most of the mess of the house is cleaned up by the time mom is finally united with Kevin, who is no longer home alone.",9,0,1,14 December 2014
The Terminator," The Story Always Seemed so Familiar-A Guilty Pleasure!
","Somewhat plagiarized and cliché. Another monster-chase movie with a science fiction twist. The scenes from the near-future are understated yet effective. It's kind of low budget as there are only a handful of 'extras' and a few killer machines shown at a time. The matte paintings seem very 'static'. Almost non-stop action for most-of-the-time and Arnold has the time-of-his-life annihilating everything in sight, except the right Sarah Connor and her real big dog. Young Arnold is in incredible physical shape. Warning: 'cheeky' male nudity and one female topless shot during obligatory 'copulation'. Overly bloody and violent? Sure. Do all 'action' movies have to have an exploding gasoline tanker? (yes) I have always considered this to be the 'prequel' for Terminator 2, which I like far better. It's a real 'Ying and Yang'. Here Mr. Muscles is too mean and in #2 he's a bit too nice. I have yet to see all the sequels that follow, as I suspect it's like 'Star Wars' with it's many unoriginal and similar story-lines? Stan Winston Studios crafted a great Terminator 'puppet' and the slight amount of stop-motion animation does not deter the overall effect. The surgical scenes always left me a little queasy, but are very well done. Please pass the popcorn!",9,0,2,1 October 2017
The Adventures of Tintin," Amazing Achievement in Motion Capture and Animation
","So they changed the dog's name to 'Snowy' because the French name doesn't translate! Spielberg and Jackson are releasing a new 'TinTin' in 2016 and I look forward to it. The animation backgrounds alone rival the best action scenes from any live-action film. The story is a bit repetitive, but the action never stops. It's a great family film for all but very small children and exceeds 'Polar Express' which is a statement I thought I would never make. There is a lot of Spielberg influence and it will somewhat remind you of an Indiana Jones adventure. 'TinTin' is a young French reporter, with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and adventure. Of course in this version, he speaks English. Tons of impossible stunts and explosions that work better when animated. So realistic except for the intentional 'comic book' look to some of the characters (The Scotland Yard Detectives and Capt. Haddock have huge noses) that you forget it's animated. The dog is amazing and had to be 'dropped in' fully animated next to the motion capture footage. This is 'Premium Pixar' style computer animation, created by Peter Jackson's WETA Studios in Australia. Basically a classic globe-trotting 'chase movie' kept almost bloodless because it is fully animated. So clean it's barely even 'PG'. However, the Capt. does have a drinking problem and it's a bit violent at times. Lots of broken glass from shattered rum bottles hitting people and huge sprays of bullets that tend to miss their mark. Very few 'bad words' if any. Many plot twists that keep you guessing until almost the very end. Argh! It's all about buried treasure and family honor! If you like Disney's 'Pirates' series you will like this as well, even though it is not live-action!",9,0,2,2 June 2015
Moana," Good Disney Entertainment
","Actually it's 8.5 rounded up to 9. Beautiful breathtaking animation with a good Disney formula story. A pleasant enough songbook but not every song is a 'stunner'. Many Easter Eggs and Disney references throughout. ('If you wear a skirt and have a sidekick, you're a (Disney) princess'.) ('You're not going to break into song again, are you?') Antagonistic villains include war-like Pirate Coconuts that act like Ewoks and magically multiply. A rather pompous giant crab that likes shiny things. A fire breathing monster that 'morphs' back into the Green Goddess of prosperity and happiness and restores the islands after a thousand years. Maui (the Demi-God) acts a lot like a very-large-in- charge 'Elvis'. He is a shapeshifter which comes in handy for fighting all the 'baddies'. 'Moana' does impossible stunts and dives and that's what fantasy animation is all about! All characters are treated with respect and there's no stereotypical nonsense, except for the chicken. I'm sure that the Polynesian 'Gods' will upset a church or two. It's fun-to-watch and almost kept the attention of my two-and-a-half-year-old Granddaughter. Not even 'Frozen' could do that! A bit too long for an animated feature but most enjoyable. The song that gets stuck in your head after the initial trance-like-state Disney Magic induces, is 'You're Welcome'. The story is loosely based on Polynesian legend and set in the ancient past. My three criticisms about the movie: 'Maui' the demigod is very large and in charge which upset some critics as a bad stereotype. There is always at least one dead character in most Disney animations (Grandmother). The angry island goddess is very scary for very young children.",9,0,3,9 June 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Quite enjoyable. An almost perfect reboat this time!
","'Homecoming' refers to the high school dance. I saw the 'Starz version' which may have a few 'tweaks' to it for cable-cast, such as language and excess graphics 'clean-up'? At last, like James Bond, this version isn't compelled to explain the 'legend' and Aunt May (without Uncle Ben) just keeps getting younger and younger. Here Peter is a scrawny 14-to16-year-old kid and no big, bulging super hero-body. Like previous tales, his tormentor/villain is someone he knows very well. It is set in a Queens-NYC high school and Michael Keaton plays the 'Vulture' villain in a super suit. (Similar to 'The Goblin' in another Spiderman movie). He is the dad of 'Liz' whom our hero has a major 'crush' on. A lot of knock down and blow 'em up action but very little body count or graphics in the version I saw. Peter Parker saves everyone in the Washington Monument Elevator (Remember that Superman does this at the Eiffel Tower?) He and the Vulture take apart an invisible plane carrying mega-weapons. As Spiderman is not a 'killer', Vulture goes to jail. Peter loses the girl but Tony Stark drops off a super-enhanced red suit, so now Aunt May knows, (and The Vulture knows), who he is. Stay tuned for the sequel...",9,0,1,27 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," It completed the 'Star Wars Trilogy', yet they continue to make more movies?
","As Mel Brooks proclaimed in 'Spaceballs': it's 'the search for more money'. All questions are answered and all the villains and heroes that need to die, to finish the saga, do so and become immortal. The empire is defeated, and Hans Solo gets his girl. The Ewoks save the day, and manage to do it without upsetting anybody's prejudice. Humans make a tasty 'roast beast'! The 'Special Edition' with added scenes and enhanced picture and sound add a bit of 'snap' to the whole thing. I still think that the Emperor was an unnecessary character and that Darth Vader was evil enough without him. Love those 'AT-AT Walkers' and 'Cycle Speeders'!",10,1,3,31 July 2018
Suicide Squad," 1/2 of a good movie and now an extended version? No thanks!
","Starts out great and then turns into an over-extended parody of itself that plays more like a video game than a movie. Killer Broccoli Zombies on the loose! I only cared for a few of the so-called meta-humans. The women steal-the-show for the most part but project head Amanda Waller 'terminated' her entire staff for almost no reason. That's just cruel. The other females are the Enchantress/June Moore, Zoe, and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She's lookin' good wearing shrunken spanky pants and a tiny t-shirt. She can take over for Wonder Women or Supergirl if they ever get out-of-shape. Most of the characters are unlikable and only a few, such as Deadshot (Will Smith), The Croc, and El Diablio, really stand out. Sick, cold-blooded killers without any remorse for their deadly sins. Why is it called the Suicide Squad? Because these awful misfits are given a suicide assignment (to kill the witch) in exchange for time-off on their lifetime prison sentences. Of course the witch wants to rule the world. What's so wonderful about Planet Earth, anyway? Like most 'stupid-hero' flicks, none of the important people die. The Joker and Waller live on in spite of going down in flames in aircraft. Homage to 'Ghostbusters I', as Enchantress dies after having her heart cut out and June Moore emerges unscathed. The Joker (Jared Leto) saves the squad. Two hours of messy mass confusion that should be 90 minutes. A real 'super' movie: Super violent and Super-stupid.",6,0,0,10 November 2017
Elf," Like 'Santa Claus-The Movie' It's half of a good film
","While at the North Pole, the first half of the film is almost magical, with homage to the Rankin-Bass animations and other Christmas classics. The good supporting cast, including Zooey Deschanel, does a fine job. However, James Caan (as Elf's real father) is a 'cooler' and sucks all the life out of the story, along with the dreadful office scenes. (I found the mail-room and 'midget' book-author sub-plots to be stupid.) Like 'Santa Claus' it's very uneven, and only comes back-to-life at the very end. Both Bob Newhart and Ed Asner are fine as 'Papa Elf' and 'Santa'. Will Ferrell is surprisingly good as a 6 ft. tall 'Elf'. But NYC is not at all magical here, except for Rockefeller Plaza. Please note that Gimbels Dept. Store went out of business about 16 years before this movie was made. 'Zooey' is adorable as 'Mrs. Elf' at the movie's end.",7,1,1,27 December 2014
Tangled," Mandy Moore's best animated performance of all time!
","Better than the more recent 'Brave', in my opinion! Except for the good but not exceptional musical score, I would rate this up there with 'Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast'. There appears to be a blending of animation and Pixar computer techniques, with many of the backgrounds 'drawn' and it works perfectly. Great characterizations and voice casting. 'Flynn' looks a lot like a young Errol Flynn. 'Rapunzel' looks like a Barbie doll, right down to her cute button nose. The pub scene (and song) intentionally make fun of Alan Meinken's own 'Gastons' pub song'. Maximus the wonder horse steals the movie. He is part valiant steed and part bloodhound. John Lassiter has truly saved Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike 'Brave', my family wants to see this movie again and again. Wagner cast iron frying pans are the new medieval secret weapon! Look for Pinocchio 'hidden' in the rafters of the 'Snugly Duckling' Pub! Excessive comic violence, hints of execution, a brief death-scene (magically reversed), plus a 'Barbie Doll' figure on a teenager make this a '9' instead of a '10'. Mandy Moore's performance is an '11'.",9,2,5,30 March 2013
Doctor Strange," Good Special Effects with a Weak Comic Book Premise
","What makes Earth so gosh-darn popular with megalomaniacs and super villains with big heads? Maybe because strange movies are so profitable in movie houses that serve beer and pizza. A planet-sized menace with hairy eyebrows covets the Planet Earth for no major apparent reason and engages a maniacal 'time-bending' mystic to conquer Earth in his name. Yes, there was an old 'Star Trek' movie (#5-Final Frontier') with such a 'large' villain who gets mistaken for our 'Supreme Being'. Yawn. Fantastic special effects that kept several CGI studios busy working. The effects are a bit reminiscent of the gravity-defying angles and buildings used in 'Inception' in 2010. Mystic nonsense. Fortunately for us such effects make for a great 'popcorn movie' that I liked in spite of itself, for the fancy graphic effects alone. It almost made me dizzy on a small(er) 40' screen! Rachel McAdams plays the perky long-suffering female surgical 'love interest'. Best effect: The Doctor split into his physical and astral beings and directing his own ER surgery. Moral: Don't play with shards of glass from magic mirrors and stay away from time portals. Like James Bond, the time-bending Doctor will return in other Marvel Adventures. Whether he becomes another great 'Iron Man' character or the now worn-out 'Hulk' remains to be seen. I am still waiting for the battle of the Muscular Marvel Girls starring female heroines in skin-tight plastic leather, like She Hulk, Spider Woman, Black Cat, and Black Widow (Sigh.)",8,2,2,29 July 2017
Interstellar," A New 'Space Odyssey' with Another Confusing Ending
","Originally a Spielberg project dating all the way back to 2006, it once again tries to answer several age-old questions such as: should mankind continue, why we are here, and what will we evolve into? Set in the not-so-distant future, but in a curious manner. Not written by Arthur C. Clarke. NASA is a secretive organization and yet cars and trucks look similar to today. After we learn all there is to know about Cooper's life and past, we finally 'blast-off' after 43 minutes. Cooper is a former NASA pilot and it drawn back into the program by Prof. Brand and his daughter. Cooper leaves behind his family including his children Tom and 'Murph'. His son remains a farmer and she becomes a scientific genius. As the Earth is now a giant 'dust-bowl' where nothing will grow due to a lack of rain and blight-failing crops. So we journey beyond our universe using a worm-hole provided by what appear to be friendly aliens but turn out to be evolved versions of Mankind. Beautiful images of wonder, space travel, hostile planets. Two astronauts die and a spacecraft is lost. There are robotic lifeforms (like 'HAL') that can 'walk' and remind us of the 'monoliths' from Space Odyssey. Rather than even try to explain it all clearly, Cooper is somehow able to transcend the boundaries of the time-space continuum and communicate with his daughter, Murph, back on Earth. He gives her the gravity equations that allow NASA to move Mankind to another home world past Jupiter. Only Cooper and Brand's daughter return from Space. They are still young while everyone else has aged over 100 years. After saying goodbye to Murph, as she dies of extreme old age, he borrows a transport to rejoin 'Astronaut Brand' as she attempts to establish a new colony. A good cast including John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Mathew McConaghey, Anne Hathaway, and newcomer Mackenzie Foy as 'Murph'. It's not a '10' in my book because the conclusion(s) are very hard-to-follow. The future aliens (us) evolve into Casper-the-ghost-like beings and the two astronauts are sort of 'reborn' but not exactly as Star-Children. Compelling storytelling with beautiful special effects and action but a bit long and we only get to enjoy about two thirds of the entire intended story. The final answer for our existence is all about love and compassion. War ceased to exist because there was no place for it, as everyone was dying of air pollution and starvation.",9,0,2,18 June 2016
Man of Steel," Must be Seen on a Big Screen. Great CGI Movie
","This movie should have been a 10, but it isn't. Very little plot development. The CGI is fantastic, but goes on forever. The spaceship and set design has an Alien/ID4 look about it.The battle scenes are over-extended. Like 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman' from the 1940's, a more appropriate title is 'Kal-El Vs. Zod'. The problem with most of the previous Superman movies was poorly-executed action scenes. In 'Superman II', the battle between Zod and Superman seems puny. They knocked each other thru billboards and tore up a few streets. Big deal. The Krypton and Fortress of Solitude sets were amazingly cheap-looking. Here, thanks to CGI, we get the alien-looking sets and battle scenes that a modern-day Superman deserves. But the movie has very little soul, to speak of. Amy Adams does a wonderful job, but she is too short for the role of Lois Lane and looks like a Hobbit next to Superman, who looks like the Wolverine with all his excessive body hair. Where is Jimmy Olsen? Why is Perry White black? By comparison, however, this 'Zod' is a much better antagonist. He is torn between his love for the Krypton People and his former friend Jor-El whom he paradoxically, killed. The Codex DNA is a wonderful plot-devise. However, as Zod is a scientific genius here and not a mindless villain just bent on revenge, he and his followers discover that it is hidden in Kal-El's DNA, not in it's original crystal-like form. A great battle scene at the end of the movie, but it goes on far too long for my taste. The ending sets us up for the sequel with 'Clark Kent' finally reporting for duty at The Daily Planet. Here, everyone seems to know that Clark is Superman, as several children, including Lana Lang, were sworn to secrecy after a young Clark saved them all from certain death in a horrific bus accident in Smallville, years earlier. 'Clark' looks exactly like 'Superman' in a suit wearing glasses, which he is.The jury is out whether I need to own this one. I am still trying to recover from the mind-numbing CGI! A curious sequel-reboot, to be sure.I wish it had been a little more like 'Superman Returns'. The ending seems to go on forever, and all that CGI gave me a big headache.",8,1,3,11 August 2013
Grease," The Best 'High School Musical' of all time!
","John Travolta and Olivia-Newton-John lead a terrific ensemble cast. Some critics called the sets 'cheap' and the story 'childish' but the movie-going public knew better. Severely cleaned up from the Broadway Musical Version, it boasts several songs custom-written for ONJ by her favorite tunesmith, John Farrar. Great personalities from the old 1950's include Eve Arden, Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes, Frankie Avalon, and Joan Blondell. 'Title opening song sung by Frankie Vallie. The Greasers and their gals were not as clean-cut in real life as they are portrayed in this film. I remember 'rumbles' with knives, but in those days, nobody ever brought guns to school. A stinging parody of 'American Grandstand and Dick Clark' tops off the program with 'Sha-Na-Na' singing their hearts out on glorious black and white TV. The 'graduation carnival' ending is really well-done. Yes, OLJ was sewed 'into her pants' when she 'comes out as a Greaser' in the song 'You'll the One That I Want'. The songs 'I'm Sandra Dee', 'Greased Lightnin' and 'Hand Jive' are often edited for content and lyrics on broadcast TV and cable. Everything looks 'real' to me, even the 'chessy' food commercials at the drive-in. Some outstanding choreography in the dance numbers. The fantasy ending is fun, also. The yearbook cover doesn't match the closing titles! Otherwise, it's pure joy after 40+ years! Unsurpassed!",10,10,10,21 April 2018
Armageddon," A guilty pleasure years ahead of its time.
","I would give this movie a 10, but then nobody would believe me. If you want to see a truly bad end-of-the-world disaster movie, go rent 'The Day After' or '2012' (Or one of the those old 'Volcano' movies.)All recent disaster flicks have outstanding special effects, but the story has to make some sense. I like ID4 but hate the sub-plots. Ditto for 'The Day After' and '2012'. A special effects 'popcorn' movie has to be fun to watch. This one is. The earth destruction scenes work in this one. The disaster camera is not directly aimed at the Eiffel Tower, White House and pyramids (though it comes close). The Army's 'secondary protocol' is logical. With the magic of DVD, it is possible to shorten this movie to a more watchable 2 hour length by skipping the 1/2 hour training and prep chapters. I believe that all the last-second near-misses are intentional, paying homage to Indiana Jones and James Bond films; and most of the humorous scenes are intentional also. Not so in other 'disaster' films,including Titanic. So there is about as much 'Techno-Talk' as the worst Star Trek Movies, and they made several mediocre ones. A bit far-fetched? Sure. Just turn off your brain, make some popcorn, and crank up the sound system!",8,0,2,7 May 2012
North by Northwest," Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint 'own' this movie
","A playful if not implausible story of mistaken identity, espionage, and romance. One of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and far easier to watch than 'Psycho' or the nightmarish 'The Birds'. Both actors are in great shape for their roles, although Eva hardly looks as young as the 26-year-old temptress she portrays. The violence is quite restrained here and it's more of a chase movie than a bloody thriller. The plot is celebrated: a suave and sophisticated advertising man is mistaken for the fictional spy 'George Kaplan' by a smuggling ring headed up by Philip Van Damm (James Mason). Whether Kaplan is supposed to be FBI or CIA is never quite explained by 'The Professor' played by Leo G. Caroll in one of his best movie roles ever. (His worst: The mad scientist in 'Tarantula'). Cary Grant's character almost dies by several playful methods: driving a runaway sports car off a cliff after Bourbon is poured down his throat, shot at by a machine gun from a crop dusting airplane, and falling off the side of Mount Rushmore. Eva's character as a 'kept woman' and secret agent is not quite plausible but she is so 'hot' it doesn't really matter. The Bernard Hermann musical score is outstanding. The Chinese idol concealing the microfilm is a thinly-disguised plot-devise borrowed from 'The Maltese Falcon' and certainly not an original idea. Also, when Jame Mason falls to his death on Mount Rushmore, it looks matted in. The title refers to both Northwest Airlines and the direction the chase takes from Chicago to South Dakota. The somewhat predictable ending on the '20th Century Limited' is humorously punctuated by the train going into a dark tunnel, as Cary and Eve finally get together, for perhaps the 2nd time, in the finale. Most enjoyable to watch and beautifully photographed. Both the forest and Mt. Rushmore are, at times, movie sets! One of my favorite movies and the only one that Hitchcock made for MGM.",9,1,3,22 February 2014
Hugo," A Masterpiece but Not for Everyone - 5 Oscars!
","Some people called it boring. Untrue. It's a cinematic masterpiece. It's beautifully done. Beautifully placed in a magnificent train station 'set', which becomes it's own magical world. Great CGI as it should be used: to enhance, not to 'blow us away' with special effects. Certainly too thoughtful and slow for fans that only like 'action-adventures' such as 'Man of Steel.' (I happen to like both.) It's a fable about purpose. Purpose in life. Purpose in thought and action. Sacha Baron Cohen turns in the best performance of his life as the 'gruff' train station policeman with a heart-of-gold that he is afraid to reveal to others. Great dog actors. Two small dogs and a Dobie. It's a story about a special orphan living in the clock tower of a Paris train station. His purpose is to tend to and wind the clocks because his drunken 'Uncle' cannot do it anymore. He is befriended by a little girl, slightly older than himself, who is also an orphan. She lives with her loving grandparents. She does not know that her grandfather is the celebrated magician and filmmaking pioneer George Melies. He is presumed dead, but he is in seclusion, believing that the world has forgotten him, as he also believes that all of his motion picture films have been destroyed. It is not true. Hugo 're-enacts' the famous Harold Lloyd scene and hangs out the window of the clock-tower on the 'hands' of the great clock, to avoid capture by the policeman. Several clips from silent films are shown including Harold Lloyd's above-mentioned famous scene and George Melies' filmworks. A magnificent movie for film enthusiasts and children who can sit through a wonderfully enchanting but 'slow-moving' film. A Martin Scorses Masterpiece. Should be 'G' rated. Nothing really objectionable. Based on the illustrated book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret'. A bit like 'Polar Express' but not as flashy as the movie and not computer animated. (It is live action with real actors.) Paradoxically, this DVD was released so early after it's theatrical release that there is no mention at all of the 5 academy awards that this film deservedly earned.",10,4,8,12 August 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Too Many Spectacular CGI Showdowns and Terrible Ending!
","It's a Civil War between the Avengers as an International Peace Accord outlaws part of the team, which is then split into two factions. MIA are The Hulk and a few other Superheroes. Of course they can't kill each other, but there is a lot of destruction and mayhem. Innocent people die and that is the reason for the 'Accord'. Bucky Barnes is a 'Manchurian Candidate', both Capt. Steve Rogers 'sidekick' and a terrible assassin. It turns out than he killed Tony Stark's parents while under Russian or Hydra control. That new gal is really quite 'electrifying'! Antman is amazing. Natasha Romanoff (Scarlet Johansson) is a great reason to watch any movie! Now will somebody please explain to me how the 'mortal-but-enhanced' beings keep from getting wounded or dying, like The Black Panther? I suspect that Natasha Romanoff is a female-Russian version of the Captain and pretty-much indestructible. Pretty much non-stop CGI between long stretches of dialog. A terrible and sad ending. Heroes are broken, on-the-mend, or imprisoned. It's all for the revenge of one man for the death of his family during one of the Avengers 'rampages' in Eastern Europe. Bucky Barnes goes back in 'cold storage' as he can't resolve the guilt from all the murders his alter-ego committed. Not for repeat viewing by me. I didn't like it at all. Review lowered to 7 stars due to final outcome. I went away depressed, unhappy and weary. Too much CGI and a two-and-a-half hour flick just wears me out!",7,1,3,28 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Much Darker than The First 'Harry Potter' movie
","Spoiler: Two very unlikable characters are killed off in this first installment of a proposed new series of 5 films. I can't help comparing a 'Dementer' to an 'Obscurus'. Both have evil foreboding and purpose. This film is at-its-best when showcasing the 'Fantastic Beasts' that wreak havoc on old NYC, such as a platypus-like creature that likes shiny things and hangs around banks! They get released on an unsuspecting city by a pastry baker named 'Kowalski' who accidentally switches identical-looking briefcases with a wizard. It's about restoring the balance of things in America with the release of a 'Thunderbird' creature by young wizard Newt Scamander, barely in his 20's. Like Hogwart's, there is a magical school and a Congress of Magicians, but it's all in the U.S.A. circa 1926. As always, great production values. Enjoyable on it's own but I can't possibly go through another '5 Part Series' as the Harry Potter movies just got darker and meaner with more death and destruction as the series progressed. However, I did like this first one and Johnny Depp might make a great 'foil' if he doesn't over-act, which he sure tends to do. 'No-maj' people and wizards in love? Unacceptable! Many other unexpected plot twists as well! I liked the ending as 'Mr. Kowalski' the baker doesn't remember why, but runs a successful bakery because of a magical spell.",9,0,0,24 November 2017
Pearl Harbor," Brukheimer Mis-Adventure is both good and terrible at the Same Time!
","Always there is a stupid love story sub-plot, even in Titanic. Paradoxically, I can love a movie and hate it at the same time. Other cases in point are: '10 Commandments' and 'GWTW' (inane story-lines and a depressingly bad 2nd half of GWTW). So it is here, also. A great Movie Blockbuster, with great digital efx, but a lot of technical and historical errors. E-2 aircraft in the background, (an anachronism) plus right-on recreations of famous newsreel footage, frame-for-frame. Switches color-timing-b/w all over the place. 'Potboiler footage' with simulated sexual situations about fictional (?) heroes and sweethearts. Some really gripping action and dog-fighting but it's just too blasted long! I usually have to watch it in two sessions, which is the 'beauty' of discs vs. tapes! Chapter selection helps also! Some directors don't know how to edit for time. Stanley K. and Jerry B. sure don't! Has 2 distinct endings, as it follows another famous epic warplane-battle, right after Pearl Harbor. That part is almost like watching an entire 2nd movie. It's nice, but unnecessary to the main story. Sometimes I end the movie there, just for that reason.",8,2,2,25 November 2015
Dirty Dancing," A 'one hit wonder' for Vestron! Great soundtrack as well!
","It launched a small studio (Vestron) that never had another hit movie or hit TV show! In spite of it's unusual (yes, semi-biographical) story, It succeeds entirely on it's music, dancing, and the strong animal chemistry between Patrick and Jennifer. 'Baby's' dancing is slightly amateurish on purpose. She is not supposed to be a pro. The sub-plots are both inane and accurate. There was such a summer-hotel in the Catskills, and it was a Jewish Resort because Jews were forbidden in many places, even hotels. Nobody cares about Patrick's original partner being 'knocked-up' except it was the reason for the movie! Jack Weston is totally annoying as the owner-operator of the place. The cynicism of the whole set-up rings true. There is only 'Dirty Dancing' in one scene at a dance party. You can see Jennifers' undies in the 'simulated sex' scene. What a wonderful title for a relatively 'tame' movie by today's standards! As portrayed, the staff was certainly underpaid, lived in tents or cheap housing, and thought the guests were pompous and 'Rubes'. The movie only takes-off during the dancing, so it was always like 'Grease' in the mis-guided critic's minds. Even the 'cheap sets' work, and the old hotel used was real; slightly run-down and in decline. So ABC is going to remake it? Why? It's a great movie, in spite of itself. A lot of humor. The talentless older sister. The senior citizen pickpockets. It's one-of-a-kind and I dare to put it in the same class as 'The Music Man' and the original versions of 'Footloose' and 'Grease'. The 2017 remake was a great disappointment.",9,0,0,9 December 2015
The Princess Bride," Endearing but not quite hilariously funny-filled with beautiful blonde people
","Both the 'Princess' and her true-love are too pretty for words and could have been 'drawn' by Walt Disney! That being said, a triumph for Director Rob Reiner and the supporting characters. Wallace Shawn is annoyingly funny and I would have poisoned him myself. Andre The Giant is terrific and I can't imagine anyone else in his role. He speaks with a pronounced accent and his dialog is hard-to-understand at times! Billy Crystal and Carol Kane probably would look that old today, but 30 years ago it required aging makeup. Like all movies of this type, there are memorable scenes that combine to make a classic movie. Fred Savage and Peter Falk are wonderful together as Grandfather and Grandson. The storybook plot keeps changing to accommodate the boy's 'wishes'. It must have a fairy tale ending! In truth, Andre's pituitary 'Giantism' condition left him rather weak as he aged. Everyone was pulled up the mountain by cables. Everything is as it should be as the villains turn out to be evil, vile liars. Just remember that (according to 'Miracle Max'), there is a big difference between almost dead and completely dead. Also, nothing beats a good MLT sandwich if the meat is lean and thinly sliced! Never in my life have I heard so much dialog during sword fights! Other funny 'touches' include: a mumbling minister. (Is he the same 'minister' used in 'Spaceballs'?) Also, instead of a fiery dragon, the 'perilous dark forest' has a man and woman-eating monstrous-sized rat and a hidden torture chamber in a tree! Great fun. PG-13 at-the-time but probably PG by today's standards.",8,0,0,27 September 2017
The Little Mermaid," One of the best!
","My now grown-up daughters wore out only 2 VHS movies when they were children: This movie and the original movie version of 'Annie'. (It takes between 60 to 100+ 'runs' through a typical good-quality VCR to do this.) Their favorite song was 'Part of Your World' which my (at the time) 11 year-old daughter sang on stage in full costume, at school. I still have this on a VHS 'home movie'. Truly amazing in every respect: Animation, adaptation. original story, songs and orchestration. Great voice actors. Still a favorite to this day; now with my grandkids. Is it a 'girl's movie'? Yes and no. As a (male) adult I thoroughly enjoy viewing it, even today. Their grandmother enjoys it as well. It was somewhat controversial in 1989, with the exaggerated-impossible 'teen-age figure' of Ariel. Buddy Hackett as the seagull and Sebastian the Crab (Samuel E. Wright) steal every scene they appear in. Pat Carroll is deliriously evil as Ursula the Sea-Witch who comes to an explosive end (which some critics deemed too violent.) Entertaining and fun with a beautiful, happy 'Disney Ending', which is far superior to the Hans Christian Anderson tale, which doesn't end well at all.",10,1,1,2 June 2020
Frozen," Right Up There with Beauty and the Beast
","Ten is for excellent, not perfect. Indeed, even 'Snow White' has it's flaws, including a few scenes 'mistracked' as photographed by the multi-plane camera, frame-by-frame. Disney Princesses are present in most of the best animated works. (In '101 Dalmatians' there is no princess, for example.)The last glut of successful recent releases all include red-headed, 'spunky' leads: Tangled, Brave, and now Frozen. I like Tangled almost as much as Frozen, as the story has more 'bite' and has a 'traditional' wicked witch in it. The floating 'lanterns' at the climax of Tangled are quite beautiful. All these Disney Animated Features have one thing in common: they are 'light operas' where larger portions of the dialogue are sung, not spoken. Here, it's almost overdone, as not all of the songs are THAT memorable, are they? The story is a bit watered-down, as I remember the 'Snow Queen' being a lot more evil in the previous mostly-live action productions. Hallmark Entertainment did a good one in 2002. Also, some of the spoken the dialogue is insipid and childish at times. Here, Elsa's 'touch of frost' becomes a King Midas-like Curse, and I don't remember it being quite that way in other versions. The computer-generated illustrations are spellbinding with intricate patterns of ice and snow. 'Sven' the reindeer owes a lot to the talking ones from 'Santa Clause'. Olaf the Snowman looks a lot like a familiar Muppet, and offers comic relief when the plot overwhelms us. The 'Marshmallow Troll' is just scary enough-watch for the 'Easter Egg' about him after the ending credits! Both 'Sven & 'Olaf' are adorable and are meant to entertain little kids while the adults enjoy the movie. Walt Disney himself paid attention to this detail as well. Both Princesses Elsa and Anna look a little Barbie-Dollish, don't they, with 'impossibly perfect' figures? The selfish-cad of a Prince is a clever plot twist. The magical trolls are also a clever stand-in for the '7 Dwarfs'. Anyway, the ending works pretty well here, as 'plucky' Anna is the key to finding the 'love' and melting The Snow Queen's heart. Where's Elsa's hero? She needs a hero too. Beauty and the Beast, also mildly imperfect, beats this one out by just a 'hair', in my book, but it's all so close. John Lasseter has truly saved the Disney Studios, hasn't he?",10,7,23,1 April 2014
Stardust," A Classic Live-Action Fairytale
","Right up there with 'The Princess Bride' and other such gems, yet often overlooked as it came out in a 'busy' movie year and was not well publicized. The classic tale of the peasant and the enchanted princess. She is a twinkling star that falls to Earth and appears to be a human being. She is made out of Stardust! Of course, it is love at first sight. The peasant must cross the barrier-fence and enter the enchanted land, where things are turned around. It's ruled by anarchy. It's like an Alternative Universe. Witches and magic are quite real. Everything 'works' differently. He must find a way to bring her into his Universe. If he does it wrong, she will turn back into a star! Fascinating and beautifully done. Some concepts, such as witches sucking up 'lifeforce' are quite familiar to fantasy fans, so it's not entirely original. Right up there with 'The Lord of the Rings' fantasies. If you have never seen it before, you will enjoy it immensely! Great production values in every category!",10,3,3,22 October 2016
Back to the Future Part III," So Good It Stands on it's own! Great Comic Western!
","This movie stands on its own without Parts I or II. One of the greatest sequels ever! Doc invents several gadgets in 1885 that are both the implausible and impossible. Mary Steenburgen injects a great deal of energy into the film as the 'schoolmarm' and 'sweetheart' of Doc Brown. Her stunt woman-double can really ride that horse! Thomas Wilson also 'runs away with the movie' as stupid villain Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen and shows that he can really act! Everything works here: Great sets, decoration, costumes, Marty's Irish ancestors. Lea Thompson (again) is fantastic. Real old-time Western actors in the saloon! 'Doc' as the reluctant 'sober' drunk! The changing tombstone picture! A winner all the way! 'Mad Dog' commits very little serious violence and the movie is far better because of it! The 'running gag' of the manure dump! The 'riveting' Clint Eastwood 'gag' of the metal stove-plate that saves Marty's life! The almost-mandatory 'gunfight in the street'! The train scenes work seamlessly from beginning to end. The train-wreak and bridge-tracks are all opticals and miniatures. The ending is a real train-wreak as Marty barely misses being run over by a modern-day train when he gets back to 1985 and Doc appears from the past (with the whole family and 'Einstein the Dog') on the most futuristic steam locomotive imaginable! One of our favorite Saturday afternoon movies. Actually better than Part I, but I don't have '11' stars!",10,5,5,21 June 2015
Men in Black II," Enjoyable Sequel with a New Villainess
","O.K. It's not the original. Like 'Ghostbusters II', you either love it or hate it because it's not so different from MIB I. It jumps right in there with very little explanation of the previous movie's setup or plot. Tommy Lee Jones has gone back to New England and, after being 'neuralized', remembers nothing of his previous existence as MIB Agent 'K'. He is the Postmaster at the local post office and acts like a big, dopey boy scout. He is surrounded by aliens to protect him at work and doesn't even know it. There are all disguised as humans. Agent 'J' (Will Smith) must bring him back to fight the evil shape-shifting Kylothian monster who is searching for the powerful 'Light of Zartha' left hidden on Earth. Like in the '5th Element' movie, it ends up being a beautiful girl, (Rosario Dawson) and not an object. Once again, the goal is 'to conquer the universe', and she kills anyone who gets in her way, just like 'Edgar' the bug in the first MIB movie. Laura Flynn Boyle is great as 'Serlenna' the hideous plant-octopus creature with giant tentacles. She disguises herself as a 'Victoria's Secret' model, of all things! As expected, plenty of carnage and sci-fi violence. Great CGI effects.A fairly good sequel and much funnier than I remember it being. (In this movie, we find out that Oprah is an alien.-Big deal.) It is way too short at only 88 minutes without titles. It leaves me wanting to see more, as The MIB characters are so much fun to watch, in action. Ya gotta love those 'alien worms' with that cheesy Mexican accent and 'Frank' the excitable talking Pug dog! Look for make-up genius Rick Baker in a brief walk-on as a MIB passport agent. Also look for 'Michael Jackson' and 'Martha Stewart' (don't blink) in very short cameos.",8,0,0,28 July 2013
Lincoln," Best Picture of 2012. A Spielberg Triumph
","The Academy got it wrong. This is the best film of 2012. This is Steven Spielberg's triumph. At about 2 1/2 hours, it's a bit long, so it is best enjoyed on 'disc' with perhaps an intermission or 2-night viewing, as it does bog down a bit at the two hour mark, but I wouldn't cut a thing. Daniel Day-Lewis IS Lincoln. His performance is beyond amazing. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones give surprisingly superlative performances. Their best ever. As do the rest of the fantastic supporting cast. It's not for children. The war and hospital sequences show the brutality and stupidity of war. The amputation 'dumping' of arms and legs is nightmarish. You must see this film. It is better and far less melodramatic than 'Gone With the Wind.' It only covers the last four months of Lincoln's administration and the passing of the 13th amendment, abolishing slavery. Both Lincoln and Mary Todd-Lincoln portray amazing stress and seem to age 'years'. Great 'sets', make up and costuming. The dialog seems absolutely real and believable . You must buy this video, but wait until the price settles down. It is a haunting and terrible slice of history. Beautiful location cinematography. The Ford Theater assassination is only covered briefly, and only because it is expected to be mentioned in the film. Amazing in all aspects. I actually give it an 'eleven'.",10,2,3,27 August 2013
Dumb and Dumber," Dumb and Grosser-Way Too Much Potty Humor
","Far too much bathroom humor unless peeing like a race horse, diarrhea, and homosexuality are your cups-of-tea. I thought this was a riot two decades ago when I was much younger. Cleaned up slightly for cable broadcast. However, two more gloriously dumb characters will never be found in any other 'screwball comedy'. They even exceed 'Laurel and Hardy'. In it's own perverse way, it beats any classic comedy from the 1930's. A Farrelly Bros. classic. Two clueless idiots start out with nothing and end up with nothing after chasing a rich heiress from Rhode Island all the way west to Aspen, Colorado. Too dumb to take a ride on the Hawaiian Tropic Bikini Bus and be the girl's suntan oil-us-up party guys! Also one of the funniest and dumbest films you will ever see, but not for the faint-of-heart and certainly enjoyed most by young adolescent males. I will probably wait for cable for the new sequel, and like and dislike it just as much. It rates a dirty '8' because, at it's best, it is hilarious. A guilty pleasure but not for children.",8,1,2,25 November 2014
Brave," Disappointing follow-up to 'Tangled'? The Plot is UnBEARable
","'Tangled' was so good we couldn't wait to see what Pixar would do next. Plot is important. All the elements are there: The rebellious princess. The wise mother. Magic and witches. But somehow it doesn't quite add up. The 'animation' seems stiffer than in 'Tangled'. It's just not as funny. Angus the horse has more personality and brains than most of the humans in this story. The women seem better 'drawn' than the men; who appear sub-human and doltish. The scenery and backgrounds are breathtaking, but this doesn't make up for the plot twist of turning humans into bears. It seems to be a bit 'off' even for Pixar. The best 'characters' with the best humor are the witch and her talking crow. The ending doesn't work. I doubt if the little girls in the audience even know what 'marrying for love' means. It's a bit too adult for such a frivolous film and doesn't quite fit.I bet most people didn't see the 'surprise' after the credits (which are 7 minutes long). The crow delivers the enchanted woodcarvings to the castle! Not as bad as other computer-rendered 'sequels' of late, but it doesn't meet the test of ownership: I did not feel compelled to see it again or add it to my video collection. A good rental as long as your kids won't mind seeing the 'villainous' enchanted bear (not the 'good' momma bear) flattened by a tree. If the plot seems somewhat familiar, Disney made another animated film in 2003: 'Brother Bear' where a human is turned into a bear. It didn't do too well at the box office either.",7,1,3,7 December 2012
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Polite '7' Stranger than the First Version! Don't Like it!
","O.K. 'Willie Wonka' had it's faults. The first part of it is boring as heck as the Golden Tickets are s-l-o-w-l-y found, including the bogus ones. Why a chicken gets it's head chopped off in the river tunnel ride is still a creepy mystery, but the songs are better, and the special effects are o.k. considering how old that movie is! Having not yet read the original, I suspect the new version is a bit closer to the Ronald Dahl tale. Orange or East-Indian faces, the Ommpa-Lompas steal the show, but the sound mix makes it hard to understand their new lyrics. Squirrels, nuts, geese and golden eggs? Same garbage chute! A bit more magical (and cruel) ending for the 4 obnoxious brats! A father-dentist for a candy-maker is very clever and that's the only thing I like about the remake. It doesn't matter where the Bucket Family lives. It's a fable about searching for true happiness and purpose! Johnny Depp plays his part well as the spirit of Michael Jackson, but like most remakes, It's merely different. It does not surpass the original movie, which didn't need to be remade!",7,1,2,6 August 2016
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Amazingly Thrilling and Beautiful Garbage
","Great special-effects but not an ounce of originality in the whole thing. We have come a long way from the shoddy special effects in the DC Comic Universe movies of years gone by. As usual, Iron Man and Tony Starks' robots and gadgets are just amazing. 'Natasha' (The Black Widow?) continues to be very charismatic. She must have a bit of Russian 'Black Cat' serum in her because she appears indestructible and has the perfect gymnast abilities of a Spiderwoman. Everybody else is perfectly predictable, especially Thor and the Hulk. I wish I had a dollar for every superhero action movie where the heroes or villains are aliens or mad (or nice) computers. In all the Universe(s) what makes Earth so special that every thing wants to conquer, destroy, or eat the entire planet? I guess I am getting too old for this type of movie? I have seen too much and I haven't been a teenager in decades.",8,0,1,10 June 2016
Annie Hall," Woody Allen is Right!
","Nothing has changed in the 40 years since this film was made. Everyone is still against Jewish people who basically just want to be left alone, judging by the recent idiotic 'rant' by the White Supremacists. Woody Allen's very autobiographical and neurotic self-portrait with his lifetime love Diane Keaton. Her character wants to be a White 'Billie Holiday'. Her Hollywood friends are into lines of cocaine and constant parties. The best 'gag' of all is when Woody sneezes and spoils about $2000 of cocaine. Alvy Singer (Woody) makes love to several neurotic 'skinny' women. He is a stand-up comedian and writer. He has appeared on TV and with Johnny Carson. It features a ton of 'stars' like Paul Simon. Also future stars like Christopher Walken, Shelly Duvall, Carol Kane, and many more, all so very young. Allen carries tons of 'Jewish Guilt' around with him. He eats an Easter ham dinner with Annie Hall's family and imagines himself a Rabbi. A doctor suggests that pork and shellfish might have made him sick (non-Kosher 'forbidden' foods). Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) is kind of a ditzy character and can't get aroused by Woody's character unless she is high. What women find attractive about him remains a great mystery to me! It starts out slowly and builds into a comedic classic. Of course it will not appeal at all to Millennials and Blue-Eyed 'Wasps'. It's a acquired taste, just like The Marx Bros. and W.C. Fields comedies. Either you find it hilarious or ya' just don't 'get' it at all!",9,1,2,9 September 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," An Enigma Wrapped inside of a Riddle!
","Only seen in Super-70MM. I never ventured Downtown to the Cinerama Music Hall in Detroit. I will attempt to review it here without 'spoilers', but there is so much to this movie. It is pretty-much divided into 'chapters' as there is the prologue with the apes which appear to be stimulated into intelligence by the mysterious humming artifacts. The future of commercial and exploratory space travel shown with great examples of models and sets that still hold up today, 50 years later. The future of computers to the point of being an intelligent 'thinking' life-form with both personality and even paranoia. Everything so carefully thought-out including the spacesuits and equipment. On the negative side, there are long passages of plot exposition and detail that border on the mundane and boring. A puzzling ending that I didn't understand until I read the novel, and now it makes perfect sense to me! Kubrick had one fault in most of his movies, and was that he never cut his scenes for time or continuity, and tended to go on too long. However, when you watch it, you will find that perhaps it is more enjoyable in several 'parts'. I often pace it for viewing on disc, this way. Still controversial after all these years. The 15 minute 'star-trip' is still enjoyable , but my 'drug of choice' these days is merely alcohol!",10,2,3,4 April 2018
Men in Black," MIB: A Special Effects Joy-Ride All the Way!
","The term 'Men in Black' refers to the slick black suits and wraparound sunglasses that all MIB agents wear. Like 'Ghostbusters', it's both a comedy and a scary sci-fi movie. The evil alien bug kills seven people: He eats Edgar and then puts on his skin as an 'Edgar' suit to pass as human. He also kills: the 'Zap-'Em' bug exterminator. A waiter and 2 aliens at the sleazy Greek Restaurant, where aliens eat pierogies. The tow-truck driver and the bug-smashing morgue clerk. All because he is looking for the 'universe hanging from Orion's belt', which is hidden somewhere on Earth. Other carnage: An alien jumps off the Guggenheim Museum. 'K' zaps 'Mikey' the bug-eyed alien. The giant cockroach swallows 'K' whole so therefore it gets blow apart; twice. Thrilling CGI by ILM. According to the MIB: The aliens among us include Al Roker, Sly Stalone and Martha Stewart. Elvis didn't die, he just went back to his home planet. Aliens are taxidrivers, pawnshop clerks with heads that-grow-back and tandem bicyclists. Agent 'J' has his hands-full delivering an alien baby squid. The agency's headquarters is a huge complex with Rip Torn as the boss (Agent 'Zed'). Just remember: there are maybe 1500 aliens on Earth at any one time. Most of them live in New York City and Queens. The secret government agency run by 'The Men in Black' is your first line of defense against total chaos and destruction from alien invaders, such as the Arquillians. Terrific alien 'suits' by make up genius Rick Baker. Look for the alien bug suit worn in the movie 'Explorers'. My favorite supporting characters: 'Frank' the talking Pug dog and the sexy 'morgue queen'. 'Don't zap her so much, she'll develop brain cancer and forget half of the classes she learned in medical school.'-Will Smith as agent 'J'. The most perfect example of contemporary filmmaking: Best film editing, cinematography, CGI, musical score, sound editing, scripting and comedy acting that you will ever see. Miles ahead of 'Ghostbusters'. Vincent D'Onofrio (as 'the bug wearing the Edgar suit') gives the most convincing performance. He should have won an Academy Award. Note: The MIB music video is not on the one disc DVD repackaged version. Easily the best of the 3 movies in the series.",10,5,7,28 July 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I hated it. Boring and repetitive
","The reverse of the classic Philip K. Dick story 'We can remember it for you wholesale' (aka 'Total Recall'). Three people, Joel, Clementine, and Mary, are interconnected by the fact that they have all attempted to have painful memories completely erased from their conscious and unconscious memory. The technique is only partially successful. At the end, all 3 remember fragments of their thoughts. The initial device looks just like a beauty parlor hair dryer a la 'The Stepford Wives'. Joel wants to forget Clementine, so he has the procedure performed in the doctor's office and then completed at home. Something goes terribly wrong and he almost can't be 'snapped out of it' as he remains unconscious for a dangerously long period of time. Thus, the viewer is forced to relive the same imperfectly-erased memories many times and for me this became quite tedious and boring. As expected, Joel and Clementine both tried to erase each other, (she first) and Mary almost forgets her love affair with the married doctor where she is office manager. Good effects, as fences and buildings all dissolve metaphorically as the memories shift and change. Almost like the movie 'Brainstorm' but not in a toxic or shocking way. I didn't like it at all and I don't care how wonderful and original everyone else thinks this movie is. The only good thing about it is that in spite of all the odds against it, Joel and Clementine finally reconnect and try to start again, possibly indicating that they really belong together after all. It's not worth 108 minutes of my time for just that revelation. As usual, Jim Carrey gives a good off-beat performance but Kate Winslet is wasted as his love interest. A minor 'sexy' scene as Mary and the technician 'get it on' at Joel's home and accidentally leave him 'plugged in' too long, like a bag of burning microwave popcorn!",3,1,3,7 November 2017
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," A Worthy Sequel. There's More Going On
","Leonard Maltin is wrong. Here's a sequel that almost outshines the first movie. There's a lot more going on in this one. Let's make one thing perfectly clear: The McCallister Family must be filthy rich. They live in a multi-million dollar home and here they go again; jetting off to Florida and then NYC. All the annoying characters are here including cheap Uncle Frank and Buzz. The 'wet bandits' Harry and Marv are here too, but this time the action takes place in NYC not Illinois. Also, Marv seems dumber (if that is possible) and Harry is meaner and carries a gun.There are more memorable characters in this one: Tim Curry and Rob Scheider as the Plaza Hotel manager and bellhop. The pigeon lady. The toy store owner. More scenery too: Rockefeller Plaza and New York City at Christmastime, Carnegie Hall, Central Park. More product 'plugs': The Plaza Hotel, American Airlines, The 'talkboy' toy recorder. Donald Trump and several other 'walk-ons'.The basic plot is similar to the first movie. Again, the family oversleeps and rushes to the airport. Kevin loses his way at the airport and ends up on the wrong plane this time instead of missing it entirely. He is hurried on-board without a ticket check. When the family lands in Florida, mom, once again, spends half the movie trying to find Kevin. He is traced to NYC because he manages to use his dad's 'stolen' credit card to stay at The Plaza. This entire storyline is preposterous today with TSA and airline ticket double checks, but it worked in 1992.So, Kevin is alone again. This time in New York City. He runs into Marv and Harry by accident. They are fugitives from jail. This time, they plan to rob 'Duncan's Toy Chest' which is a lot like the F.A.O. Schwartz Toy store, only more magical. Kevin defends the store and takes photos of the robbers, who chase him to a relative's apartment which is in a state of remodeling disrepair. Again, there is no one home.(Marv's skull is so dense that bricks bounce off of it, only leaving minor dents.) Marv wants the camera's negatives, which is impossible-it's a Polaroid Camera! Kevin creates another 'Rube Goldberg' style obstacle course for the robbers, which seems a bit more tiresome this time. (We've seen it all before, but I love the blowtorch and exploding toilet.) Kevin tricks them into chasing him into Central Park at night. The robbers are thwarted by an unbelievable combination of pigeon feed, hungry pigeons and slippery ice. Kevin shoots off fireworks, and this signals the police to pick up the bandits. Plot holes: Who would sell such powerful fireworks to an under-age kid? How convenient that all the locations are close to each other (?) Somehow, the entire family finds their way to the Plaza Hotel in New York and Kevin finds his way to Rockefeller Plaza. Everyone is together again on Christmas morning, only this time it's in NYC. Another rousing John Williams musical score. It's a bit long with a running time of 2 hrs.Other comments: 'Fake swearing' so nothing really objectionable. 'Talkboy' was an actual Tiger Electronics toy. The comic violence is no worse than a 'Looney Tunes' cartoon or The 3 Stooges. It's not sadistic, it's totally unbelievable. A silly and funny sequel. Only John Hughes could imagine such a film.",8,0,0,31 December 2012
Groundhog Day," A Classic Fantasy Fable: Bill Murray's Best
","Bill Murray will be remembered for the 'Ghostbusters' films but this is his best. This is a fable that most of us can relate to: what if we could do it all over again? Mistakes, broken promises, fatal errors that ruined our life and cannot be undone. In 'Groundhog Day'' a self-centered egotistic man is 'cursed' to relive the same 24 hour day over and over again. The spell is broken when he finally gets it right, which appears to take 40 or 50 times. Chris Elliot (the cameraman) gives a surprisingly restrained performance and Andie MacDowell plays 'Rita' the TV producer. She is a small town girl that wants a better life. Cleverly written with many plot twists. Every day is almost the same but slightly different. For example, Phil robs an armored truck, and dresses in a 'Superfly' outfit complete with fancy car. His 'date' dresses like a 'French Maid'. Such outrageous events do not repeat and happen only once. It's always 6 AM again with the radio playing 'I Got You Babe' and Phil jumping into a freezing cold shower; heading off again to re-tape the same 'Groundhog Day' segment for a small time Pittsburgh Pa. TV station.Almost a '10' but I give it a '9' because I do not like the suicidal implications of the film. Phil gives up on himself and decides to die in a very violent manner because he cannot move forward. He jumps off a building. Electrocutes himself. Finally, he drives off a cliff and the truck bursts into a ball of fire; witnessed with horror by his film crew. (The groundhog is 'driving'!) It's both hilarious and terrible to watch. But he doesn't die. He wakes up in bed at 6AM again and again.This film is actually embraced by many religious groups for its unique and unusual philosophical message. Why does the same day keep repeating? There is a hint in the film: Listen for a soundtrack 'ping' when he washes his hands at 6:01 AM. It's a time warp. Is he being cursed or blessed by an evil supernatural force or an angel? Because Phil finally gets it right, I'm betting on the angel. Like 'It's a Wonderful Life', the weather doesn't change until the day does. Phil is now a changed man with a purpose in life and finally wins the girl's heart. The last song in the movie is from 'Brigadoon', the musical about a magical Scottish village, suspended in time. Harold Ramis both co-writes and directs. His best film also!",9,1,3,2 February 2013
Total Recall," Very Graphic . Great Science Fiction
","Director Paul Verhoeven's bloody and graphic sci-fi classic. Bullet-riddled bodies, knife slashes, decapitations and arms cut off. Not for the faint-of-heart! The cable-edited version is almost better because some of the gore and cuss-words are reduced. (Too bad it has commercials!) A great story concept from Philip K. Dick about the future of mankind and bargain vacations. Don't actually travel there, just have the whole experience trans-implanted into your mind. This all goes wrong when lowly construction worker Doug Quaid visits 'Rekall' and has a psychotic meltdown. Is he Quaid or Hauser? Blue collar worker or company super spy? On Mars or just imagining the whole thing? Several clues point to both possible answers: His 'athletically built brunette' looks exactly like the computer model. Sharon Stone bitches that she 'had to travel all the way to f*cking Mars, just for this'. Mars is a horrible place with no atmosphere. There is a hefty 'tax' on oxygen. Luxury Hilton Hotels and a grimy 'poor side of town' with dives, beggars and prostitutes. (Love that 3-breasted woman!) A great ending, as good old Arnold sets things right, killing off the stinking pig of an industrialist dictator (played to the hilt by Ronny Cox) in a man-to-man fight. (Guess who wins?) This movie has everything: Sharon Stone as the kick-ass slutty fake wife, mis-formed mutant humans, great special effects, and a great ending, as 'Quaid' restores air to the Martian atmosphere and embraces the heroine in a lusty kiss. One of the last major movies that used matte paintings, large-sized miniatures and 10 sets, as CGI was still in it's infancy. If you can handle all the blood and gore, it's a great ride!",9,0,1,3 August 2014
Beauty and the Beast," Walt would have loved it. Rated 11 stars and a box of tissues!
","An almost perfect adaptation with many subtle changes that many people will probably miss. What I dislike is the obvious 'gayness' of LeFou. A magnificent marriage of live action, animation, and CGI. 'Agathe' is the 'enchantress' who changes the Prince into the Beast, and yet this is never quite obvious to the townspeople. Additional songs and reworked lyrics, plus a more complete 'background story' about Belle's and the Prince's parents. Only one or two scary spots and a rather pleasing interpretation of the Beast in 'human' form. Belle's father is portrayed as a very clever man and not as an absent-minded buffoon. Gaston shoots The Beast several times and it's 'almost bloodless' Hollywood violence. In 1991, he stabbed the Beast to death. Gaston dies as he traditionally should; never by the hand of the Disney hero or heroine. When a film or stage-play is 'reborn' it's impossible to please everyone, but this one tries very hard to do so. Amazing cinematography, costumes and art direction. An outstanding cast and very well performed. I thought Emma Watson was just fine. I want that White Stallion with his built-in 'GPS'! I miss the (extra) song 'Human Again' and it should have been there! Enjoyable and entertaining ending titles. A great marketing idea would be the packaging of the 1991 animation and this 2017 version as a double Blu-Ray? For almost everyone except extremely small children. Curiously reviewed, as people either totally loved it or hated it!",10,19,30,17 June 2017
Titanic," A true classic-The 'GWTW' of disaster movies
","Best version since the old 'A Night to Remember' (1953). With all those reviews, I only need to 'touch' on the synopsis of the film. 101 year-old 'Rose', long thought to have died in the disaster, reappears as the wreck is examined and it's contents rescued yet again. The 'explorer-scavenger' is fascinated both with the story and romance of it all, but especially the recovery of the romantic 58 Caret heart-shaped diamond necklace known as 'The Heart of the Sea' which is worth more than the Hope Diamond. Did such a gem exist, or is it the product of the screenwriter's vivid imagination? It is a well-told tale and the time passes so fast that it doesn't seem like a 3 hour movie at all. Superb cinematography combined with seamlessly beautiful special effects and the best shipwreck ever filmed. Models and the CGI are most convincing. The Oscar-winning musical score and audio are amazing. The ships motors and interior looks entirely authentic. Kathy Bates has a wonderful 'minor' role as the 'Unsinkable' Molly Brown, and, as MGM used to say, 'a cast of 'more stars than there are in Heaven'. Billy Zane plays the deliciously mean and arrogant fiancée of 17-year-old 'Rose',who is being forced to have pre-nupual sex, and marry a man she does not love, for his money. She hates it and is almost driven to suicide. One nude scene of a beautiful woman-child will offend only a minority of the viewing audience. (Rated PG-13. Also a few choice swear words.) Best ending ever (warning-huge spoiler) as 'Rose' slips the huge blue diamond into the sea. The original DVD is letterboxed and not 'anamorphic'. Buy a later version, which is remastered for 16x9 TV. It is remastered to 1.78 format. I like to stop it around chapter 18 for an 'intermission'. I also highly recommend seeing 'Titanic-The Artifact Exhibit' as a roadshow or Las Vegas attraction.",10,3,6,21 March 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Well-Used Video Disc!
","Except for the end part with 'He Who Must Not Be Named' (which bares a strange similarity to the Hebrew God 'He Who has no name?') almost as enjoyable as the 'Wizard of Oz' 1939 classic for both its content and whimsy. I don't know why this is not considered the best of the series? We are introduced to a world that is entirely invisible to the average 'Muggle'? Such ingenuity and imagination: The street of shops, the bank, Hogwarts , the magical train, nasty bankers, giant trolls, dragons, multi-headed guard dogs, wizards both good, evil, and questionable in nature... Only the introduction of the evil Voldemort tarnishes the major of the whole experience. Without viewing this first film, it is impossible to appreciate and enjoy the entire series which has several meaner, darker (and less pleasant) 'chapters'.",10,0,1,17 December 2018
It's a Wonderful Life," A Scooge-like Christmas Fable. One of the best!
","Mr. Potter, a bitter, miserly man thinks of nothing but accumulating wealth and power. In the process, he almost destroys the life of an idealistic young man and his family. Harry Bailey (James Stewart) is rescued by his guardian angel on Christmas Eve, and stopped from committing suicide. His guardian angel 2nd class (Clarence) shows Harry what everyone's life would have been like if Harry was never born at all. It really 'leaves a significant hole' in the lives of others. He is 'shown the way back' and realizes that he really did have (and has) a wonderful life after all. An all-star cast featuring Donna Reed as his wife, Mary. Featuring Karolyn Grimes as his youngest daughter 'Zu-Zu'. Often shown colorized. Produced and Directed by Frank Capra. A good movie to watch if you are having a 'blue' Christmas. How many good deeds in your own rather-boring life have positively affected your own family and friends? Think about it and 'count your blessings'!",10,0,0,16 December 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry Potter and the Giant Snake? Deliciously Wicked!
","On the Internet, someone felt this was the worst movie in the series? It's one of the best and a bit easier to follow than some later entries. One surprise after another. So much going on here: The Weasley's flying British Ford with an attitude, the Whomping Willow Tree, ominous messages written in blood, Moaning Myrtle, a pompous professor, a wand duel between Draco and Harry. R.K. Rowling wisely 'allows' Ginny to only petrify and not kill Hogwart students. The 'Riddle' of Tom Riddle. The amazing and funny Mandrake potting class. The monster that gives me chills even on the small(er) TV screen: The ancient giant Parsal-snake, with the Medusea-like power to kill on direct sight, and huge appetite! Stunningly complex backgrounds and sets. The ingenious use of the Phoenix-Bird, Sorting Hat, and the Sword of Griffindor to save everyone; as Harry is saved from certain death by the restoring power of the Phoenix tears. One of the longest movies in the series, but almost as good as the first one!",10,0,1,11 September 2016
Dark Shadows," Starts out great and loses its way in the middle
","Even John Depp can't save this one. I am assuming that you are somewhat familiar with the other previous versions. Most of the beginning is straight 'historic' story-telling and it is riveting. The chain-wrapped coffin of Barnabas Collins is found in a construction site. After 200 years of imprisonment, Barnabas drains 11 victims in no time. He proceeds to Collinswood Mansion after first walking through town, seeing the club scene in 1974. He tells only a select few that he is the real thing, vampire and all. To the others he is their distant English cousin. All the familiar characters are there including Willie Loomis, who doesn't have as much to do in this version but he becomes Barnabas' servant as always. Angelique the Witch never died, and she runs the 'Angel Bay' fisheries which is the more successful cannery as the Collins family is the poor second cannery and has lost it's former glory. Dr. Hoffman is along to to try and alter Barnabas (and her own) bloodwork. As always, Victoria and Josette are played by the same young girl. 'Vicky' is the reincarnation of Barnabas' lost love. The first half is not too bad, but then the story gets choppy, sloppy, and uneven. Angelique and Barnabas have a steamy love scene, Alice Cooper guests at a 'Happening' party which falls flat. Then all 'Hell' breaks loose. The witch entombs him and little David saves him. There is a huge Witch Vs. Vampire fight-to-the-death, and eventually both the cannery and the great house burn-to-the-ground. There of course is a lot more going before this, involving werewolves, ghosts, and Barnabas arrested for the murder of Dr. Hoffman. She betrayed him so he killed her and drank her blood. Way too 'campy' in the 2nd half and choppy editing, although some of that could be for 'running time'. The soundtrack is horrible and includes 'Carpenters' Songs. Finally, they get it right at the end as Vicky takes a swan dive off the watery breakers at the cliff. She dies and the spirit of Josette is restored to life. Barnabas falls with her and is restored to human form! A very financially successful film in spite of itself!",6,1,1,6 August 2016
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," A Landmark Film
","The first full-length animated feature is a mere 84 minutes and I will not attempt to critique it here. Most of it is wonderful and the 7 dwarfs are a landmark in comedy. The musical score is wonderful and hypnotic. The animal animation is very cute and over-the-top. How can reviewers not rate this a '10'? My copy has always seemed a little washed out, as Snow White's skin tones are truly 'snow white'. It contains a few rather scary and dramatic sequences that are amazingly detailed.",10,0,0,14 May 2020
Inception," Matrix-Like and surreal. Spellbinding!
","Mind manipulation through the control of The Dreamworld. Lavishly photographed in several International destinations. An impossible number of CGI effects as well. Mr. Cobb's line-of-work is highly unusual and unique. He is a spy that extracts secrets lodged in the mind of his victims. He enters their dreams and controls their unconscious direction. Leonardo DiCaprio does an outstanding job and it almost outdoes 'Titanic' or his portrayal of Howard Hughes as 'The Aviator'. He uses a tiny spinning top so he can tell reality from dreams. At the movie's finish, that device seems to fail and the viewer must decide if he is awake or not. Similar only to 'Brainstorn' (a very choppy and troubled film) in the use of a connection device to the mind, but the 'gizmo' is tiny and fits in a briefcase. Because it is all about dreams and deception, there is a hint of a 'Mission Impossible' scenario as Cobbs can be and do everything within the scope of the Dreamscape. His dead wife often shows up and that is a great hint as to whether Cobb is awake or asleep.You may have to watch it again if you haven't seen it in a few years. There are too many details to process. As our beloved Mr. Spock would remark, 'fascinating'.",9,0,0,26 July 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," The ' Despicable Me' Company Makes Another Great Animation!
","Walt Disney once said that the best animated films were not made just for children alone. An amazingly clever and intricately animated film for children of all ages. Yes, most of the animals can talk, but only when their owners aren't around just like 'Toy Story'. It would be a '10' except for: a vicious Viper Snake and talk about 'doing away' with humans by the evil bunny and others. The first 30 minutes outshine the rest of the movie. Max the dog gets a new roommate in the form of a big lovable, sloppy, hairy 'homeless' dog named Duke and they get lost together at the dog park. It's everything a good dog movie should be plus several things it shouldn't be. Several clichÃ©s intertwine with several unpredictable plot twists: Two animal gangs: despicable alley cats and rejected 'flushed' pets (reptiles, spiders,snakes). The two dogs are mistaken as strays by two mean dogcatchers. 'Duke' goes on a quest to look for his old master (who has died of old age). A 'Mad Hatter' of an otherwise cute-looking bunny rabbit goes after them with a vengeance, then saves them both from certain drowning in the dogcatcher's truck. So many things going on including animals partying while the owner's 'do whatever it is they do' during the workaday hours. Incredible action throughout the dangerous city including dark and smelly sewers and unfinished NYC skyscrapers. The ingenious use of many familiar songs, including 'We Go Together' from 'Grease', after Max and Duke have a food coma after pigging out on dozens and dozens of sausages at the hot dog factory. Overall, a fantastic family movie from Illumination Films who also made 'The Minion Movie'. Not perfect but excellent anyway. It's just 'purr-fect'! I can see why it was such a box office hit in 2016! Look for an 'Easter Egg' a few minutes into the ending credits. It is too intense for very small children under age 6 or so although several reviewers think it was made for that age group.",9,0,0,9 August 2017
Arrival," A masterpiece of thoughtful Science fiction. Not everyone will like it
","Compare it to '2001' which is (also) a bit long, boring (in spots) and drawn-out. It's not for the Marvel-DC action-movie fan. Reminiscent of 'Contact' which is also about an alien encounter. It's a mystery and involves second-sight (premonition) and the reason for our cosmic existence and meaning in the Universe. Part of the following synopsis is paraphrased from 'Wikipedia', so please do not accuse me of plagiarism. The movie opens with a 'false memory' as linguist Louise Banks' daughter dies of cancer. But Louise is unmarried and has no child. 12 giant Zeppelin-shaped spaceships hover over 12 different locations all around the world. A team of scientists and military go inside and attempt to establish a common language to find out the 4 basic questions of who, what, where, and why they are here. She and physicist 'Ian' lead the team. Louise (Amy Adams) has a communication breakthrough with it appears to involve a 'weapon' as it is mistaken for the word 'tool'. These creatures are 7-legged 'Heptapods' and resemble giant octopus. Many miraculous events occur: Louise is able to reach Chinese General Shang and an interplanetary war is averted. The aliens impart special secrets about time and space travel. It is unclear if Louise could see into the future before, but now she can. She marries Ian (Jeremy Renner) and she has her daughter 'Hannah' knowing all along that the young girl will die in her late teens or early twenties. Many questions remain unanswered, such as: what 'favor' will the Human Race return to rescue these beings in the far future, and is time and life more circular than linear in concept. Best enjoyed 'at home'. I think a large 16x9 TV is perfect, as it's all about the story, not just the special effects.",10,0,3,6 November 2017
Wonder Woman," A '10' means excellent but not perfect. Best Superhero film ever?
","I could also pick this film apart as there are so many stereotypes in it. 'The Chief' (American Indian) is the worst! The story could have been set in either World War, except for the early aircraft. I have to keep reminding myself that it is a fantasy-comic book creation and it far outclasses even 'Superman-I', 'Batman Returns', and it's reboot. It opens with a fascinating 'travelogue' to the hidden Island of the Amazons. 'Diana' is truly unique, but does not know that she is the daughter of Zeus; not even told by her own mother. Curious that Amazons are almost invincible, but can be felled by a single lead bullet. The legend was changed as a man landing on the island should have taken away the women's powers. Also, I want to comment about Wonder Woman's costume. Briefer than a Trump statement yet un-revealing to all, like cheerleader 'spanky pants'. Perhaps aided by CGI? Now back to the movie. The Germans are even more evil than usual. The Amazons 'take no prisoners' and even Wonder Woman kills off a lot of people. That's a different 'take' than most DC heroes. The mad 'Dr. Maru' wears a 'Phantom of the Opera' mask and she creates hideous gases that promise uncontrollable strength and nightmarish execution. The film deserves it's PG-13 rating as it is quite violent (without being too overly graphic).'Ares' the God of War, is disguised as an elderly British aristocrat. He will allow Mankind to destroy the Earth so that he can recreate it in his image of peace? A-1 in most respects, and if it doesn't 'run-away' with several technical Oscars then the Academy is truly blind to mainstream films. Some of it is almost spellbinding and most of the roles are very well-cast. I suppose that a 'Clash of the Titans' finish (Diana vs. Ares) was necessary, but as always, it's too grandiose and overdone. Does Diana 'drop a plane' (no houses available) on evil Dr. Poison or not? (I failed to stay to the end of the titles for a possible 'Easter Egg'.) A great performance by Gal Gadot. Like most 'Batmans', some of her chest is padded! She runs and leaps (aided by CGI) quite convincingly and looks the part as she does many of her own stunts. Chris Pine is a likable 'Bill Shatner-type', and doesn't quite 'become' his character 'Steve'. In 'Wonder Woman Magazine' 'Ares' cannot die, so I expect him to return again in spite of his apparent demise in this movie. Worth seeing on a big screen, so don't just wait for the Blu-Ray!",10,7,20,19 June 2017
Despicable Me," Pixar Has Serious Competition: Far from Despicable, It's Incredible!
","I was ready to hate this film, having just viewed 'Brave' on cable and not liking it that much. It's a rare situation when a film outshines its plot. The dumbest plot ever: A mad scientist-villain wants to steal the moon and has to go to 'The Bank of Evil' (formerly Lehman Bros.) to borrow the money. He is turned down because he has a 'bad-track record' performing evil deeds. He then employs 3 innocent orphan girls to enter the liar of his new competitor, the nerdy super-villain 'Vector', to steal a shrink-ray. Sounds like enough story for 10 minutes, right? It's produced with images as good as anything I have seen from Pixar and far better than the annoying 'Madagascar' series. It works because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The humor carries the movie as it pokes fun at everything from 'Annie', to Girl Scouts Cookies, to werewolves. I won't spoil it for you by revealing all the inside jokes. The 'minions' are not fully explained, but they are little yellow nearsighted 'ompa-lompas' with goggles and speak like Cousin 'It'. The film's a bit long, but I am sure it plays better on DVD without cable commercials every 10 minutes. Steve Carell's character, 'Gur', is the 'Despicable Me' with an intentionally-bad fake accent that is a cross between Bela Lugosi and a Hungarian waiter.Highly recommended. Cleverly animated with lots of gadgets and contraptions, like a 'Chuck Jones' cartoon. The roller coaster ride is a great computer-simulation. (It 'feels' real.) Nothing really bad or objectionable and fine for children old enough to enjoy Pixar movies such as 'Cars' and 'Toy Story'.(Adults might like it as well.)",8,1,2,10 December 2012
Back to the Future Part II," Not as Much Fun as Part I but Quite Good
","The working title of the film was 'Paradox' and both this sequel and Part I of this film confirm this. The film was changed because George Mcfly's actor from Part I did not sign on for Part II. He held out for more money so they wrote the story around him. George appears upside-down in an anti-gravity suit in and looks like 'Pappy Yokum' from Li'l Abner. Anyone could be in that makeup! So the story becomes simply about a sports book that lists all the winning scores from several previous decades. Biff is given this book by his 'future' self who steals the time machine to go back to 1955. This completely screws up the time-space continuum and George McFly ends up dead! I like the futuristic 1st half of the movie, but the scenes set in revised 1955 and 1985 seem a bit more cruel and mean-spirited, and not in tone with the rest of the series. The 1955 redux is very confusing, though very well-done and not as much much fun as the original Part I. The producers suggest watching Parts I and II back-to-back to understand the differences better. The optical process shots with multiple personalities (like 'The Parent Trap') are amazing and flawless. Michael (in drag) as his own daughter! The futuristic (2015) is a lot of fun. Biff as a casino boss and Marty's 'pumped up' big-breasted Mom are both hilarious and disastrous to see. It all serves as a set-up for Part III, which is is actually the best movie of the Trilogy.",8,0,1,4 March 2009
The Iron Giant," An often overlooked Classic-Buy it Soon!
","Cable used to run this all the time. In 1999 WB got out of feature animation for a while, after that disastrous 'Quest for Camelot' misfire. An ambitious feature based on the book 'The Iron Giant'. This property had legs, and could have been a series if handled properly--it wasn't. It was a financial success, however. Intentionally set in the early 1950's around the time of such wonderful nonsense as 'War of the Worlds', 'Invaders From Mars' and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still'. A young boy finds a giant robot and at first nobody believes him. The original purpose of it was to conquer planets, as it has laser beams and sonic rays, like all good giant monsters, but all it really wants to be is friendly, like Superman. It eats scrap metal, not people. A paranoid government agent sees it as a threat to all Mankind, and an Army General and troops are sent to destroy it, of course. In the wrong hands, this would have been a terrible film, but along the way, we are treated to good, early CGI animation and a slightly-preachful storyline about 'being what you want to be'. Mild violence ('Bambi' dies) and cuss-words: 'Hell' used is few times. Make this inappropriate for very young kids, but otherwise quite acceptable. Your 8 to 10 year-old will love it! The T.V.'Evil-Brain Monster' sequence is also a bit scary! Buy this while you still can! I have to watch my VHS 'First Men in the Moon' a while longer, as I waited too long. It is currently 'out-of-print' on DVD, (until Sony makes more.)!",8,0,1,3 April 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Nobody Would Have Gone to See a Film Called 'Batman Dies' !
","Ironically, beautifully filmed in 70mm Imax. Rent it but do not attempt to watch it on free cable. It's 4 hours long with 78 min. of commercials skipped via fast forward. The storyline is too long and involved. 'Bane's addiction' to the strength-increasing drug 'Venom' is barely explained. Who is his 'little sister'? An illogical plot-twist. In this version, both Batman and Bane were both trained by the same mysterious monks somewhere in Shangra-La. Bane is a 'Liberal' who hates Big Money and the Rich Upper Class. He almost crashes Wall Street and blows up a sports stadium. Hundreds of innocent people die. He turns a fusion energy project into a nuclear bomb which will destroy millions. Batman picks up the 'bomb' and flies it away from the city in his Batplane. (He dies?) Thus, future movies will have Robin as the hero. Bane likes to execute by breaking his victim's necks. I did not like it at all. If not for the EFX and Anne Hathaway as a heroic smokin'-hot Catwoman. Major Spoiler: She kills 'Bane' in a hail of gunfire. She has no ethical 'no kill code' to adhere to. Right up there with the Star Wars prequel wherein Darth Vader kills all the young Jedi knights. Nightmarish and disturbing. Mass murder, knives, bombs, and guns everywhere.",6,0,1,2 April 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Unenjoyable although well-crafted and terribly hard-to-follow
","Why nobody liked this movie: It 'kills off' Clark Kent, Superman, and Jimmy Olsen. It should have been titled 'Superman v Luthor-Dawn of Doomsday'. Why does Lex Luthor have hair or is this the younger son of Lex? Please don't ask me if I wasn't paying attention, as this is a horribly twisted and dark entry in the very confusing saga leading up to The Justice League Movie. I barely saw Cyborg and Flash. Was the Superhero 'not seen since 1982' Aquaman in suspended hibernation? Watching it on PPV made if difficult to navigate back and forth to double-check these things. So here's what I do know: The super-villain Doomsday is a 'Frankensteinian' resurrection of Zod with a bit of Luthor's blood added to the 'witches brew'. Doomsday is (almost) mindless and Gargantuan in size. He is radioactive and regenerates tremendous (electrical and nuclear) energy. Being of Kryptonian origin, he is almost impossible to kill except with a Kryptonite tipped spear. Wonder Woman does manage to hack off a limb (or 2) of Doomsday along the way. The basic story is that Superman, being Godlike but not perfect, is unable to save everyone all the time and is 'framed' as the killer in a disastrous war. Lex Luthor, as always, is the antagonist. He convinces the world leaders and Batman that Superman is an evil alien and must be stopped. So Batman tries to kill Superman with all the world watching. Yeah, yet another climax with 2 superheroes battling each other. Remembering that Batman is human, how he avoids death at the hands of Superman defies all logic. Better 'love' scenes (not explicit) between 'Clark' and Lois than most Superman adventures. The whole thing is exhausting to endure and painfully over-long at 2 and a half hours. It's very dark and somber. The ending is so depressing, as both Clark Kent and Superman are dead and buried. Lex Luthor goes 'mad' in prison, of course. Superman will undoubtedly return, as the dirt on Clark's casket starts to 'levitate'...",8,4,5,5 November 2017
Mr. Holland's Opus," 30 years of a High School Music Teacher's Life
","I am from the era when the high school arts programs were thrown away and male athletics were not. Like Forest Gump with the music and events flowing together almost seamlessly. A movie I need to view about every five years, to remind me that life never goes exactly as planned for anyone. I have issues with three things about the film: He almost has an affair with a gifted singer (and we never find out if she 'makes it' on Broadway). Ironically, his only child is born deaf and it takes Mr. Holland over 20 years to realize just how clever and smart his son is. His 'Magnum Opus' American Symphony is barely 6 minutes long after 30 years of composition? At least they didn't ruin the ending by having musical funding miraculously restored at the last minute. Life doesn't work like that. A superior film, but not everyone will appreciate it. It reminds me of 'Goodbye Mr. Chips' and 'The Paper Chase' which are both about charismatic college professors",9,0,1,28 August 2018
The Greatest Showman," Zendaya is amazing!
","She is, as also noted by other critics, a true scene-stealer. The camera can't get enough of her! Incredibly beautiful and very talented. (Yes, Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron are excellent too.) Absolutely inaccurate as a biography of the true life of P.T. Barnum. He had 4 girls, not two. His museum was never called a 'circus'. His fortune was lost in a clock company venture, not by Jenny Lyn's concert tour, which made him a half-a-million dollars in profit. His first tent show was not in New York (city or state). A spellbinding-powerhouse of a musical from start to finish with incredible songs, production numbers, locations, set decorations, costumes, etc. Also a very financially-successful movie. Great family entertainment.A great majority of the film is carried by the music. (If you dislike musicals as being 'unrealistic' then this extravaganza is not for you. Everyone 'bursts' into song.) For everyone else it is pure joy. The depiction of the oddities and performers is quite accurate and very well documented.",10,2,2,29 April 2020
Thor: The Dark World," It's Superman II with long hair and a Big Metal Meat Tenderizer!
","Yes, It's unintentionally funny, stupid and overly long. Both 'Superman Returns' and 'Man of Steel' have more merit, and that's stretching things! Watch it for the two hot girls and pumped up Chris. Watch it for the over-the-top computer graphics. Check your brain at the door. I didn't even enjoy 'Guardians of the Universe' that much. I guess I am having SFX overload. Think of how much better even Superman III-IV could have been with all these mindless explosions! I was tired after watching the first hour of this mess. Everything in the last half was totally predictable. Where did 'Papa Thor' go? Back to the Smurfs? I thought I was watching 'Independence Day 2' for a while. You must watch the 'Easter Eggs' between the 10 minute credits. Mind-numbing and stupid but great for adolescent boys who like 'manly' women, 'WWE' and all that stuff. Very redundant to the first Thor. Verdict: Thor 2 made my head sore!",5,0,1,15 April 2015
Lucy," Super Woman goes out of control-A 'Space Oddessy' Ending
","Lucy is also the nickname of one of the earliest known primitive ape-like creatures that evolved into modern man. This Lucy (Scarlett Johanssen) is an American ex-patriate living in Taiwan. She is captured and turned into a drug-carrying 'mule' with a package of a most powerful drug that she accidentally absorbs into her body. Things go terribly wrong. She slowly evolves into a super-being that makes Supergirl look like a panty-waist. She is able to control all manner of communication, and hooks up with a most learned professor played, of course by Morgan Freeman, in Paris. The Taiwanese 'Mafia' wants their drugs back which leads to an action film with a very intense appetite for bloody carnage as people are stabbed and shot to death all over the place. Even she kills people. It saves time! She appears to regress back to the beginning of time as her brain usage approaches 100%. Us puny humans only use 10% of our brainpower while dolphins use up to 20%. So she has everything from x-ray vision to the ability to defy gravity and sticks her assassins, helpless, on the ceiling. She also has better diagnostic powers than a CAT or PET scan. She learns Chinese in an hour. She places all her total accumulation of knowledge into a pen-drive and disappears entirely. Some of the digital effects make no sense whatsoever as she 'reaches out' to the mainframe computer in the University Office. She Tweets back 'I Am Everywhere'. A great mind-bending (far-out) light show that takes us back to the very beginning of time that is almost comprehensible, given the storyline. Stanley Kubrick and Douglas Trumbull would be proud. Totally entertaining if you can stand its brutally violent nature, but also totally preposterous and unbelievable.",8,2,3,23 January 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I Was Very Disappointed-An Unimaginative Remake of Chapter IV
","O.K. BB-8 is not as bad as Jar-Jar Binks. Technically superior to 'A New Hope' but essentially an obvious remake; not a new chapter. So much unexplained background. Why does Han Solos' son turn evil? Why is the Emperor a projected image of a giant ogre with a scared face? The New Hope is female, and who is she related to? (I suspect that she's the daughter of Luke Skywalker.) Too many painful deaths. Han Solo killed by his own son? Heroes and villains both die. Very much like a James Bond franchise. How many times did they essentially remake 'Thunderball' with variations? At least three? Best enjoyed by a brand-new generation of fans. For us older die-hard fans, it's depressing to see everyone looking so old. Only the 'droids and Chewie seem ageless. Wonderful and thrilling yet redundant and unimaginative at the same time: 1.

","Before all this, I was a great Star Wars fan, but there is so much more 'depth' to this entire series of books and movies. There are many great plot synopsis reviews here and on the web, so I will stick to just a few highlights and comments. Vodemort, having desecrated Dumbledore's tomb, steals the most powerful 'Elder' wand, but it later turns out that he is not it's true owner, as Draco killed Dumbledore and Harry defeated him. Dumbledore was stricken with a fatal spell anyway, so it is more of a mercy-killing than a murder, but that's yet another story. There is a touching scene where Harry gets to meet both of his dead parents through a Resurrection Stone hidden inside of the 'Snitch'. Voldemort eventually discovers that the Elder Wand does not cooperate and won't obey all his commands. He kills Harry Potter, as Harry is the unwilling recipient of a part of Voldemorts' soul. He dies, but meets Dumbledore at a 'half-way-station' on the way to Heaven. He is given the choice to return to the living or move on to the next level of existence. He chooses life. There is a huge battle scene. Both Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are destroyed and many Death Eaters and good Wizards are killed in this battle. As Hagrid carries Harry (who appears dead) he springs back to life and has a 'Wizards' Battle to the Death' with Voldemort, as the last Parsal-Snake is killed with the Magic Sword of Griffindore. Harry wisely destroys the Elder Wand by breaking it in half, and throws it into the water, as not even a Wizard should have that much power or live forever. In the epilogue, Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermione send their children to Hogwarts 19 years later. A most satisfying ending and Draco sends his white-haired son to Hogwarts as well! A long but very fast-moving action film that is totally spell-binding!",10,0,2,9 September 2016
Footloose," A Fairly Decent Remake Somewhat Updated
","Ren and Ariel dance and fall in love in a town where dancing is illegal for minors! It follows the original 'Footloose' scene-for-scene in many places but the remake has a lot of energy and the necessary climatic dance scene does not disappoint. Kevin Bacon's charisma in the 1984 original is substituted here for the charisma of Julianne Hough in 2011. Ren's athletic skills as a big-city high school gymnast are again, understated. Basically a 'fish-out-of-water' city boy becomes the subject of vicious small town gossip and is blamed for just about everything. He is framed for possessing a 'joint' and gets an undeserved bad reputation as a troublemaker. Most entertaining in a 'Grease' sort-of-way, including racing action. The critics never get it right and many of the 'users' didn't like the remake. It's got a pretty-good soundtrack but in 1984, yeah, it was better. In the original version, there was book-burning, and that stupid idea is thankfully not in the remake. Very good dancing by all and most of it is fun to watch with a bit of overacting here and there. It's actually based on a true-life story about a small town that banned teen-aged dancing after a high school prom tragedy. Most of the film was 'made in Georgia' and at realistic-looking locations. Some will argue that a remake was unnecessary as it was a rather 'minor' film to begin with. The 'box office' was exceptionally good, for a remake.",8,0,4,2 July 2017
Cloud Atlas," Like 2001 and Bladerunner, It's a Confusing Classic
","First of all, this was totally ignored by 'The Oscars' in 2012. It lost tons of money-over $75 Million and is one of the most ambitious attempts to bring an epic novel to the screen, in recent years. Not for everyone, as it shows everything from whippings to graphic and bloody tribal warfare to electrocution. Oh, there is some highly sexual content and nudity as well. If I haven't completely scared you away from watching this, then also be aware that the futuristic segments rival both the best StarTrek and Bladerunner-type movies that you have ever seen. The story is impossible to fully relate and would take several pages. It spans a timeline from 1849 to 2346. It's a revolving story with 6 distinct parts that repeat like a M*A*S*H movie, both for emphasis and clarity. It takes a while to get used to this, but eventually you see how everything ties in together, especially at the end. Five main actors play several roles each, both as men and women. (Yes, Halle Berry as a man!) Also stars Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, and Susan Sarandon and many others; who you will not always recognize due to the terrific make-up. Hugo Weaving as 'Nurse Noakes' is the exception. He looks like a man 'in drag' but I believe that was intentional, as that is the only humorous sequence. It's all about predestination, reincarnation, and Man's search for truth and freedom. Tom Hanks plays 'Zachry' the storyteller that both opens and closes the movie. He is haunted by a 'green goblin' that only he can see or that may be the author's representation of the terrible evil and prejudice in Mankind. That is the only character I don't quite understand. Parts of the movie will remind you of 'Roots', 'Bladerunner', 'Logan's Run', 'Soilent Green' and even 'The China Syndrome', but it is done in such a way that is fresh in the re-telling. The ending is amazing as the 'Brave New World' exists in a post-apocalyptic Hawaii that is both incredibly primitive and ultra-futuristic. Both Tom Hanks and Halle Berry deserved Ocsars for their performances. As long as 'The 10 Commandments' at 171 minutes; best viewed in parts, to fully comprehend it. This will eventually 'make money' thru Blu-Ray DVD release but will never be shown on 'free' TV without several drastic cuts due to its content. Quotable lines: 'I believe that Death is only a door. When it closes, another one opens. From womb to tomb, our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we both have a future.'",10,4,6,27 September 2013
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," It's really not that funny! The ending ruins the film.
","The 'Emperor's new clothes' rule still applies. Just because everyone thinks it is brilliant, doesn't make it so. The ending is horrible, as the movie is shut-down because a 'noted British Expert' is accidentally slain. There isn't even an ending! Oh, even I have my favorite parts: 'I'm not dead, I'm getting better' The 'Vestal Virgins' aren't 'sexy enough'. (In the old video game, they show their silky 'bottoms'.) 'The Bleeding Knight' is gross and I also don't like a similar scene in 'Addams Family 2'. The 'Shrubbery' and silly 'ni' Knights are only amusing. Killing everyone at the castle wedding is terrible, and the 'gay' groom singing about it doesn't help at all! The 'Frenchman' at the wall is stupid. The 'killer rabbit' just doesn't work. I do love the classic Monty Python animation. It would have been funnier if the whole movie was animated! Too much potty humor. Yes, I loved it all 40 years ago! Having seen the short-lived Vegas 'Spamalot' musical, (which was much funnier), there is still hope for this material. I hope they make THAT into a film!",5,3,10,19 August 2016
Back to the Future," Parts I and II should be watched Back to Back!
","That's because they are mirror versions of the same movie, showing how 'the time-warp continuum' effect changes everything, both in the past and the future. (An unproven time travel theory 'made fun of' in several movies, including 'Milllenium'. Also de-bunked in the 2 new 'Star Trek' movies as old Spock meets young Spock face-to-face.) A genius of an idea born out of necessity, as 'George McFly's' actor failed to 'sign-up' for Part II! The DeLorean auto was a great choice as a time machine. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson carry the entire series. Mary Steenburgen in Part III is wonderful. 'Einstein-the Dog' deserves a canine 'Oscar' award! Basically a 'fish-out-of water' classic, if follows the mis-adventures of two bumbling 'nerds' as they stumble through time, in three different movies, from 1885 to 2015 with a constantly malfunctioning time machine, leaving behind messy continuity errors that need to be cleaned up to avoid disastrous events in time. Clever use of special effects (all optical) abound throughout. Much use of split screen as in 'Parent Trap'. Michael appears as his own 'daughter' in drag (part II) and looks wonderful (though more than a bit creepy!) A few almost-innocent racist comments and situations, including two lines edited out (on the DVD version) involving the timeliness of the words 'colored and black' in 1955. Easily Fox and Lloyd's best movie roles 'of-all-time'.",10,0,0,20 June 2015
Sully," 'Poetic license' in the story takes it down one star. Tom Hanks is great.
","Tom Hanks in Chesley Sullenburger. He becomes the character. What could have been a long drawn-out movie with only 10 minutes of serious action becomes a masterpiece under the watchful eye of Director Clint Eastwood. Some of the biographical details may seem like filler, but it's nice to know a little bit about the man after all the hype about the hero. An attempt is made to discredit the magnificent deed of saving all 155 on board the aircraft, by the National Safety Board. Apparently, the movie ruffled a few feathers high up, as it was claimed that the inquest 'didn't exactly happen that way'. Indeed! That's because it all had to be compressed into a mere 96 minutes. That's in far less time that even one board hearing, I am sure. Spellbinding. Great storytelling. I 'believed' that I was aboard the aircraft. The re-enactment was superb. 'Not a movie for those with a fear of flying'-says The New York Times Review.",9,3,4,11 February 2018
Beetlejuice," Michael Keaton Outdoes Himself-Great Special Effects and Makeup
","A great film to watch at Halloween, but be forewarned that he really does say 'Nice f*cking model', then grabs himself, and it's seldom cut-out or 'looped', even on cable! Otherwise, a relatively tame film made 30 years ago that still holds up well. Most of the special effects are not CGI and therefore very clever use of full size and miniature models, puppetry, stop-motion, and make-up. (The 'Sandworm World' is CGI.) Alec Baldwin and Genna Davis play the hapless couple who don't realize that they are dead and have to call 'Betelgeuse' (pronounced 'Beetlejuice') to exorcise the living from their own house. We all know who that is going to be. Michael Keaton has a field day dancing around and playing his devilishly dead self. Winona Ryder is the young 'creepy' daughter of the new owners of the house. At first, she is the only one that will see the 'ghostly inhabitants' who are really just nice friendly 'spirits'. Curious mis-casting with Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet in terrible, minor roles. It's fun, slow in spots, and yet seems way too short at the end. I love the witch doctor, the guy with the shrunken head, and the 2-piece (she is sawed in half) magician's assistant, all siting there in the afterlife waiting room, for their 'social worker' to help them. Everyone appears there exactly as they died. The man with the tire-treads on him looks a bit flat. The girl with green make-up. Not for little kids, due to the great make-up/effects and cuss word. Danny Elfman's haunting musical score is the best! Don't ya just hate sandworms?",8,1,2,5 October 2013
The Simpsons Movie," D'oh! An Outstanding Achievement. Hilarriously Funny!
","Homer adopts the pig from a Krusty Burger commercial and sets off a series of events that ruin the environment so bad that President Arnold Schwarzenegger puts a glass dome over the entire town of Springfield! Lake Springfield becomes the most polluted watershed of all time as Homer dumps a giant silo filled with 'pig leavings' into it. An evil Skull and Crossbones laughs in the poisoned lake and it creates a mutated squirrel with a thousand eyeballs (but no 3-eyed glowfish). Makes fun of several films including itself: Frankenstein (villagers wielding touches), Austin Powers, Lake Placid, Disney movies, 'Under the Dome' TV Series, the 'Helping Hands' from 'Labyrinth'. Look carefully for 'special' cameos in the riot-torch scene. Other movie references that I missed, I am sure. Homer also saves the day after the EPA decides to blow up the dome and the town as well. (It will become the 'new' Grand Canyon.) Great stylized animation and typical irrelevant Simpsons humor throughout. (Look out! Here comes the Spider-Pig') Just remember, like Homer, if things get really bad, flee to Alaska with your family and go on a 'vision-quest' to find your purpose in life. (Was that big idea stolen from 'Dances with Wolves' or 'Star Wars'?) Starts out with a relatively 'mild' Itchy and Scratchy prequel. EPA Director 'Cargill' is named after the poultry company and voiced by Albert Brooks. Highly recommended for all Simpsons fans. Baby Maggie saves the day at the very end and Marge forgives Homer, as she always does.",10,2,3,23 October 2017
The Wizard of Oz," The Best Fantasy Film of All Time
","With it's iconic cast and legendary group of Directors and writers, how can anyone not believe that this is one of the 25 best films of all time, according to both The American Film Institute and The Library of Congress. There have been countless attempts at sequels and prequels to this film that have always fallen short, although the recent 'Great and Powerful Oz' was very good, indeed. 'Welcome to Munchkinland' and 'Over the Rainbow' are permanently burned into my memory and cannot be forgotten. A triumph of all that makes a great movie unforgettable: The music, cinematography, costumes. staging, and special effects (that still 'hold up' to this day) are just truly amazing. Just recently discovered by my 5-year-old grand-daughter. ('Papa, have you seen this movie before?')",10,0,0,3 January 2020
The Martian," Great EFX but a bit preposterous, boring, yet spellbinding?
","With 1100 reviews, I suppose that few people may read this, but here goes: Fantastic sets and special effects. I wish I had seen this on a big screen. I am sure that it has been compared to everything from '2001' to 'Apollo 13'. It seems a bit tedious, but that might be because of the 3 hour cable broadcast time if you don't DVR it. An astronaut presumed dead is accidentally left behind when a long-term Mars Mission is aborted due to an intense hurricane force Martian sand storm is encountered. The first third of the movie centers on how Astronaut 'Mark' manages to set up housekeeping, grow his own crops, and re-establish communications with Houston Control. Then it shift gears and become a rescue mission much like Apollo 13. There are equipment failures along the way and the mission crew almost commits mutiny when they decide to double back and rescue the stranded man. Smart and intelligently presented by Ridley Scott but not everyone's 'cup of tea'. I enjoyed it but found many badly-answered plot hole questions: There seems to be an unlimited supply of oxygen in the space suits. Maybe they can manufacture it in the suit? The 'Power of Duct Tape' creates a perfect air seal. (I guess it really is the handyman's secret weapon?) A partial nudity shower scene is really unnecessary. Even after a clear plastic seal blows out, the entire craft doesn't fog up and blow apart? Oh, well, enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it all to make perfect sense.",9,0,2,25 January 2018
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Clever references to Homer's 'Oddessy' during the Depression
","A wonderful cast and I admit that even I didn't 'get' all of the characters, but I will try, so here goes: The renegade sheriff is the 'Devil'. John Goodman is the 'Cyclops' Charles Dunning is 'Zeus'. The 3 'amorous' ladies by the water are the 'Sirens' George Clooney is 'Ulysses' and Holly Hunter is his wife. The blind man is the 'soothsayer'. I am not sure what character 'Baby-Face' Nelson represents, but he is 'plum-crazy'. Surprisingly little (if any) 'cussing' and muted violence even in the KKK cross-burning scene. Suprisingly complex dialog for George, The Governor, and John Goodman's characters. Based on the actual political career and campaign by a Southern governor seeking re-election during the Great Depression. The Coen Brothers Masterpiece? I believe so. Authentic and honest 'Hillbilly period' music. Violent but rather tongue-in-cheek like the 'Butch Cassidy' movie. It may be a bit slow for some impatient viewers. Enjoy the wonderful musical program. A critical and financial success.",10,1,1,1 June 2018
