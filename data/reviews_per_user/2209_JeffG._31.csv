The Blair Witch Project," Now THIS is a horror film!
","After the barrage of awful 'Scream' clones that Hollywood has been force-feeding the public for the past several years, two unknown filmmakers have brought us a film that should show people what makes a truly effective horror film.The acting from the three stars was in fine form and the ad-libbed dialogue was really impressive. It was totally convincing and never seemed fake or contrieved. It was interesting and rather unnerving seeing the them start out as cocky and full of gusto (especially Heather) and go on a slow, gradual emotional and psychological decline. How they gradually started getting more ditraught about their predicament and started turning on each other. Their 'discoveries' in the woods and the sounds in the distance was creepy for the audience as well as the characters.I was rather impressed at how they didn't use background music to cue the audience in on when to feel unnerved. The movie relied solely on the environment and the reactions of the characters to set the mood. I used to think that a movie with no music would never work but it looks like I was wrong.The last ten minutes of the movie were especially creepy. I could actually feel my heart racing. And the ending blew me, and the rest of the audience, away.It's nice to finally see someone make a horror movie the way it should be done. No cheap 'jump' shots. No young, photogenic stars from the WB network. No hit alternative rock soundtrack. Just good old fashioned mood and atmosphere. Recommended.",Null,1,2,2 August 1999
Alien 3," An ugly, depressing mess.
","Calling this movie a disappoitnment is an understatement. 'Alien 3' would be a bad movie on its own, but following the masterpieces that were 'Alien' and 'Aliens' makes it even worse.'Alien 3' is a relentlessly grim movie. For starters, Newt and Hicks are killed off literally at the beginning. The two people who gave Ripley some much-deserved completion and happiness in her life at the end of 'Aliens' are instantly killed. It's not a good sign when the audience is depressed before the opening credits are even over. The setting of the movie is really bleak as well. It's set on an abonened prison colony on a hot, lice-infested planer occupied by criminals who have formed some kind of religious cult. Ripley, like all the other occupants of the colony, are trapped on this planet with no way out. And as it turns out, an alien is right down there with them. The hopelessness of the whole scenario and the fact that there are no likeable characters other than Ripley make this movie a real downer. The whole movie is real ugly to look at and badly lit. The inept direction and editing make the whole movie real confusing. The score is decent, but it hardly matches up to the excellent scores of Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner in the first two films.Do yourself a favor and skip this movie as well as the next one in the series, 'Alien Resurrestion.' Watch the first two movies instead.",1,496,541,8 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good first act
","On its own, 'Phantom Menace' probably wouldn't hold up too well. However, as a first part of a three-movie story arc, it suceeds quite well. The primary purpose of this movie appears to be to set up parts of this story arc which will presumably pay off with the next two movies. I found 'Phantom Menace' to an enjoyable movie. Not a great film, but not as bad as the press made it out to be.",9,1,2,16 September 1999
Monty Python's Life of Brian," The 'Dogma' of the 70's
","I disagree with the notion of this film being blasphemous. I'm a Christian and I found it really funny! This film shows the Pythons at their finest. Takes a look at religion and the life of Jesus and isn't afraid to have a few laughs in the process. While it's not a good as 'Holy Grail,' I recommend this movie to all Python fans and Christians who don't take all matters of faith too seriously.",9,2,6,26 November 1999
Shakespeare in Love," Decent romantic comedy, but nothing special.
","After all the hype and the Oscars, I finally got around to seeing 'Shakespeare In Love' when it came out on video. While it wasn't a bad film, I failed to see what all the fuss was about. It wasn't the best romantic comedy I've ever seen and certainly not Best Picture material. Especially when compared to the other films that were nominated. The sets and costumes were excellent. The acting was pretty good. Some of the dialogue was quite good. And I was impressed by the fact they decided to forgo the typical Hollywood ending.On the whole, this wasn't a bad movie. But it wasn't anywhere near as good as 'Saving Private Ryan' (which I feel should've won) or 'Elizabeth.' Hopefully the Academy will get it right next time.",Null,1,2,3 October 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Let's hope this is the last.
","This movie is not as bad as the horrible 'Alien 3,' but sadly not by much. As in the last film, none of the elements that made the first two 'Alien' movies so great are present. The premise cloning Ripley, complete with the alien embryo inside her, with a drop of her blood (how did they even find one 200 years afterwards?) just so that they could study a dangerous, long-extinct alien race is completely illogical. Come to think of it, the whole movie is completely illogical. It's easy to see why screenwriter Joss Whedon (of 'Buffy' fame) was so disappointed with the end results of this movie.I've head talk of the possibility of another 'Alien' movie being made. Let's hope they decide to quit while they're behind.",6,0,0,8 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Satisfying conclusion
","'Jedi' is not as good as the first two films of the trilogy, but it's still a really good movie. Jedi's primary purpose is to tie up the loose ends from the first two movies while bringing the entire saga to a satisfying conclusion. I think they accomplish this quite well. As far as the Ewoks are concerned, I don't love them but I don't really dislike them either.",9,1,2,16 September 1999
Alien," A sci-fi classic.
","'Alien' ranks as one of the finest sci-fi movies ever made. One thing that makes this movie so unique, especially for its time, was that it combined elements of science fiction and horror. The spaceship, the outer-space setting and the alien itself (designed by H.R. Geiger) are the sci-fi elements. But when you get down to it, 'Alien' is more of a horror movie, only with a spaceship instead of a haunted house and an alien instead of a monster. The claustrophobic setting and the dark corridors provide the right atmosphere for this movie.The movie is wonderfully directed by Ridley Scott. The same man who would give us another sci-fi classic, 'Blade Runner,' three years later. The special effects are impressive, especially for 1979. The pacing is handled very well, subtle in just the right moments and chaotic in just the right moments. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is wonderful. The only real flaw in the film is that it gets a little slow at times. Minor complaint though.To see sci-fi cinema at its best, check out this movie and the excellent sequel that followed, 'Aliens.'",10,0,1,8 October 1999
Armageddon," The 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' of the 90's
","I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this is the first movie I ever saw which I felt was actually insulting my intelligence. I could write a book on all the things wrong with this movie (I could easily devote a few chapters to the scientific inaccuracies alone) and it seems that many other people here have done that already. The only redeeming value I can find in this noisy piece of Hollywood product is that it can be shown to film students as an example of how not to make a movie. If I hadn't gone to see this movie with a few friends, 'Armageddon' would've been the first movie I would've ever walked out of.",1,1,3,5 July 1999
American Beauty," A wonderful, complex film.
","After over two years of hyped-up, special-effects driven movies, it looks like 'real' movies are finally making a comaback. The latest addition to the list of quality films comming out lately is 'American Beauty.'The movie presents us with what seems like the ideal setting for any American: a life in the suburbs with a middle-class nuclear family. But we see that undeaneath the surface, things are not as ideal as they appear. Kevin Spacey is a man working a job he hates with an overbearing, slightly psychotic wife and an angst-ridden teenage daughter. Their new neighbors are an ex-marine, his teenage son who videotapes people and his really passive, unemotional wife. Thrown into the mix is the daughter's nymphomaniac friend who ends up inspiring Spacey to change his life, in a number of rash, illogical and not so wholesome ways.Over the course of the movie, we see that there's more to each and every single one of these people than meets the eye. And some of these aspects are more obvious than others. Each one of them has some sort of secret or dark side of their personalities that they try to hide under a facade of 'normality.' None of these people are happy with their lives or themselves, although they try to cover it up as best they can. Their feelings and insecutities continue to build up inside them right up until the film's bittersweet conclusion.Although none of the characters in the film could be considered likeable, they aren't presented in such a manner that the viewer can't muster up some degree of sympathy for them. All the elements of this film come together. It's very well directed. They acting is top-notch (even if Annette Benning threatens to go a little over the top on occasion), the script and dialogue are of top quality and the score is really good. My only complaint about the film is the opening line where Kevin Spacy says 'Within a year, I'll be dead.' This gives away stuff that the audience would rather not know and slightly lessens the impact of the film.'American Beauty' is the best movie I've seen this year so far and I certainly do not hesitate to recommend it. The somewhat downbeat nature of this film may keep it from getting nominated by the Academy Awards, but I really hope it will.",9,0,0,29 September 1999
Dark City," One of the best movies of the 90's!
","This is a movie I really wish I saw on the big screen. When it was in theaters, I passed it up, thinking it was just another dumb sci-fi movie that was another noise special effects movie devoid of plot or fully realized characters. When I rented it on video, I realized how wrong I was! Sure, the special effects are great, but the story was really engaging. Wonderful direction, fine acting and music really compliment the film as well. I wish Hollywood made more movies like this nowadays.",10,0,1,5 July 1999
Aliens," Great movie. Especially the Director's Cut.
","'Alies' is proof that not all sequels have to be bad. I actually kind of prefer it to the original. This movie takes what was introduced in the first movie and expands on it. One of the admirable things about this movie is that they didn't do a retread of the original. While 'Alien' was pretty much a horror movie set on a spaceship, 'Aliens' is more of an action oriented sci-fi movie. The human elements of this movie really add to the film. Ripley decides to confront her fears (brought upon her by the events in the first movie) by going on the mission to the colony and benefits from it by the end of the movie. In the Director's Cut, we learn of Ripley's daughter who died during Ripley's 50-year sleep in the escape pod. This helps in explaining her realtionship with Newt.The direction is excellent and the special effects are superb. The Director's Cut version of this movie adds 17 minutes of footage, where we learn about Ripley's daughter, see Ripley get stripped of her license by the Company, and see further development in the relationship between Ripley and Newt. This extra footage is not simply filler. This is footage that was important to the film and footage that James Cameron had to cut for time. The extra footage really does enhance the movie.[WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW]......... Like the first movie, 'Aliens' ends in a surprisingly peaceful manner following the chaos in the rest of the film. Only this ending is considerably less bittersweet than the end of 'Alien.' Ripley has faced her fears and overcome the nightmares she's been suffering from them. She's also been blessed with a new family in Hicks and Newt. I was really upset that they were both killed at the beginning of the horrible 'Alien 3.' But I try console myself by telling myself that 'Alien 3' doesn't exist. Hey, if 'Highlander' fans can deny the existence of the two dreadful sequels, why can't I do the same with the last two 'Alien' movies?This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 80's and a true testimony of James Cameron's talents. I feel that this movie and the original 'Terminator' are Cameron's best work.",10,1,2,8 October 1999
Saving Private Ryan," A very powerful movie
","I saw this movie the day it opened not knowing much about it beforehand. I was really blown aray. This was without a doubt, the most realistic portrayal of war I've ever seen in a movie. The D-Day re-enactment alone is one of the most powerful scenes ever put to film. This movie is the flip side of those glamorized Hollywood John Wayne movies from the 40's. And the scary thing is, as real it it looked, it's still probably not as real as it actually was.I'd never seen an audience so silent leaving a movie theater before. I left that theater with a new appreciation for the people who fought and died in World War II. I recently gathered up the courage to see this movie a second time when it came out on video and it lost none of the emotional imact it had on me the first time. A true mark of a great film. In the summer that gave us 'Godzilla,' 'Armageddon' and 'The Avengers,' this movie was a breath of fresh air.",10,0,0,3 August 1999
Empire Records," You can feel the IQ points dropping
","Roger Ebert pretty much summed this movie up best when he described it as a soundtrack in search of a film. There's no plot here, just a bunch of obnoxious teens goofing off and dancing. This is one of those movies that really insults your intelligence. Spare yourself and rent something else instead.",1,9,26,5 July 1999
Empire Records," What was the point here?
","If there was ever a movie that was just an excuse to sell a soundtrack album or two, this is it. There's no plot, no three-dimensional characters, nothing. Just a bunch of dim-witted record store employees (isn't that a rather redundant term?) dancing and acting stupid. Take away all the pointless music and dancing scenes and barely end up with any sort of movie. Spare yourself.",1,6,20,3 August 1999
Grave of the Fireflies," The most emotionally draining film I've ever seen.
","No matter what you've heard about this movie, it can't possibly prepare you for the impact it actually has on you. Everyone should see this movie. Just don't watch it when you're feeling a little down and need cheering up.",10,2,3,20 April 1999
The Evil Dead," Low-budget horror classic!
","Despite the incredibly low budget of this movie (which shows in everything from the superimposed moon to the obviously fake blood and gore), this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Unlike most horror movies made back then, and now, this film is sprinkled with touches of dark humor. One of the things that sets the 'Evil Dead' movies apart from most horror films is their unique combination of traditional horror fare with dark comedy. This is a film you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. One of my favorites! The other two films, 'Evil Dead 2' and 'Army of Darkness' are also well worth watching.",9,0,1,30 August 1999
This Is Spinal Tap," The funniest movie ever!
","Hillarious movie about an ageing rock band that embarks on a disasterous North American tour. No matter how many times I see this movie, it never fails to make me laugh. So many great gags and classic lines that have been quoted time and time again. The fact that they improvised all the dialogue is expecially impressive. Improvied comedy at its best.
This movie especially hits home if you've had any kind of experience in the music business. You either laugh because you've shared some of the same experiences as this band or you get depressed for exactly the same reasons. The stupidity of the band members is also worth a lot of laughs. You can't help but laugh at a band who descibes their music in deep, philosophical terms while writing songs like 'Big Bottom' and 'Sex Farm.' It's amazing how many real-life bands in the 80's seemed to share the same mentality as these guys.Unfortunately, this also happens to be one of the most difficult to find movies around, as it's been out of print on video for years. It got released on DVD lat year but it's now out of print on that format as well for some reason. Hopefully, someone will wake up and reissue this classic film again.",10,0,2,5 October 1999
There's Something About Mary," Makes 'Porky's' look like 'The Ice Storm' by comparison.
","I went to see this movie after hearing about how funny it was. Guess they must have seen a different movie than I did. I didn't laugh even once during this film. Lots of bathroom humor, jokes about the mentally retarded, sex jokes, jokes about the mentally retarded, no likeable characters, bad acting...did I mention jokes about the mentally retarded? The fact that so many people actually considered this piece of trash funny and the sight off all the people in the theater around me laughing was disturbing to say the least. Is this really how far we as a society have degenerated?This movie was not quite as repulsive as 'Very Bad Things' or 'Last House On the Left,' but it came real close.",1,26,51,3 October 1999
Detroit Rock City," A pleasant surprise!
","Okay, this movie is not exactly high art and I seriously doubt it'll win any Oscars. However, this movie is a really enjoyable teen romp through the 70's. Although this movie chronicles the adventures on four teens who are trying to make it to a Kiss concert, Kiss isn't the central focus of this movie. This movie is specificly about these four kids and their hopes, dreams and escapades. Take away the Kiss factor and you still end up with a good movie. I'll admit we could've done without the 'girls' bathroom' scene. But this movie is a really enjoyable rock 'n' roll comedy.If you're a fan of Kiss, or 70's hard rock in general, then you're sure to enjoy this movie. If you're a fan of good coming of age movies, you're sure to enjoy this movie. Just don't take it too seriously.",8,1,3,26 December 1999
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful movie
","This movie is not just a Christmas classic, but one of the best movies ever. Despite being over 50 years old, it hasn't aged at all and is just as endearing now as ever. Jimmy Stewart gives the performance of his lifetime as the selfless George Bailey. The movie also delivers an important, though often overlooked message: no man is a failure who has friends. What a wonderful movie.",10,1,4,19 December 1999
The Green Mile," One of the best films of 1999
","This film ties with 'American Beauty' as my favorite film of 1999. What a glorious year for movies this has been! Tom Hanks turns in another fine performance and the rest of the cast is great as well. This movie is well-acted, well-directed and really emotional. I initially has reservations about seeing it because of the three-hour length, but I was so immensed in the story that I didn't even think about the length. As long as the movie's good, the length doesn't matter.I also found this to be one of the saddest movies I've ever seen with a fairly bittersweet ending. It's a movie that really tugs at your emotional strings. This is not the emotional button-pushing of your avarage Hollywood product. This is true emotion. I highly reccomend this film.",9,0,0,14 December 1999
Halloween," Carpenter at his best!
","A horror classic that has become THE movie to watch every Halloween, even 20 years after its release. Gorehounds may be disappointed by the lack of gore and those more accustomed to the 'Scream' genre may find it slow. But the story plus the mood and atmosphere are what really make the film. The movie's also boosted by an appropriately creepy score from Carpenter himself. They just doesn't seem to make horror movies like this anymore.",8,0,0,31 October 1999
Carrie," Great movie!
","Film adaptions of Stephen King books tend to be either really good or really bad. Thankfully, this movie falls into the former category. In fact, this could be the best King novel-turned film ever.At first, this movie seems to be your typical high school film. We're introduced at once to Carrie (Sissy Spacek) and the hellish life that she lives. Everyone at school picks on her and make her life a living hell. As if that wasn't bad enough, she lives with her mother (Piper Laurie) who's a religious fanatic, thinks everything is a sin and regularly locks Carrie in the closet. You can't help but sympathise for her.Unknown to everyone, however, Carrie has telekinetic powers. At first, her powers are really underplayed in the film. By the time the prom scene approaches though, they become more and more prominent. Carrie uses them against her mother while waiting for her prom date and then she uses them at the prom in a very destructive manner. The whole prom scene is both scary and sad. Sad because Carrie finally has her moment where it looks like she's finally been accepted only to have it all end in humiliation. And it's scary to see her powers come full circle in such a destructive and deadly manner. The scene where she slowly walks out of the gym as it burns is a really chilling moment.While this is a scary movie that has earned its place as a horror classic, it's also a really sad movie as well. Carrie's life is miserable from the beginning right to the end. Watching Carrie kill all of her tormenters at the prom is every high school misfit's dream come true. Carrie has her revenge, but at what price?'Carrie' is a classic horror film every horror fan should watch. It's well-directed with the right amount of atmosphere in just the right places and Spacek and Laurie are simply outstanding in their roles. Recommended!",Null,11,16,14 October 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Watch this movie, avoid the sequels.
","This movie is a true 80's horror classic. A genuinely creepy horror movie that knows that phychological terror had a much bigger impact than tons of gore, though it does offers a fair amount of blood. It's too bad all the dreadful sequels have sort of given this movie a bad name. The only flaws in this movie are the generally bad acting and the groaner ending. Definitely a film to check out, but avoid the sequels at all cost.",Null,0,0,1 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that started it all!
","I've seen this movie countless times and I just never get sick of it. It's one of my favorites and one of the greatest movies of all time. A movie that's the perfect combination of great special effects, a great story and memorable characters. All these movies that have been trying to make another 'Star Wars' over the past two decades generally overlook exactly what made this movie so great in the first place. They tend to just focus on the sets and special effects and overlook the story and characters. George Lucas took great care on all three. A classic movie that will continue to be loved decades from now.",10,0,0,16 September 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Python at their finest!
",This is arguably the Pythons best movie. A really funny movie with hardly a weak moment. The sketches (this movie is pretty much a series of sketches) are hilarious and the movie is full of classic lines. A must see for any fan of Monty Python or British comedy in general.,9,0,0,5 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the trilogy.
","'Empire' is the best film of the original trilogy. Rather than remake the first film, Lucas takes the world that he devoped in the first movie and takes things even further. The story in this movie is better. There's much more character devolopment and the characters are fleshed out more. The movie takes a darker tone with the fate of Han Solo and the big revelation regarding Luke and Darth Vader. The bigger budget also helps allowing for improved special effects to complement the improvements from the first movie. Proof that not all sequels have to suck.",10,0,0,16 September 1999
Contact," One of the best movies of 1997
","Proof that a great story and great special effects can go hand in hand. This movie was one of the most pleasant surprises of 1997. A well-done, well-acted, intelligent sci-fi movie which serves as a breath of fresh air in the age of 'Independence Day' and 'Armageddon.'",10,0,1,5 July 1999
Princess Mononoke," An excellent animated epic!
","Miyazaki and Studio Ghibi have always produced fine work, but they've really outdone themselves with this wonderful anime epic. This movie is the kind of thing that Disney used to put out back in its glory days. Unique tale of man vs. nature stepped heavily in Japanese mythology. The characters are well realized and Miyazaki refuses to make them purely good or evil. They all posess shades of grey that you don't often see in characters in most modern animated fables. The English version of this movie is very well done. The translation is quite accurate and Neil Gaiman was the perfect choice for writing the English screenplay for a movie like this. The dubbing, which could've easilly killed this film, is good for the most part. The best performances come from Gillian Anderson (whose husky voice suits Moro perfectly) and Minnie Driver, who does such a fine job you don't even think about someone speaking with an English accent in feudal Japan.I'm glad to see this movie not only getting released in America, but actually being shown in theaters al well. This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, as it best delivers the full visual effect. I really hope that Miyazaki makes another movie.",10,1,3,28 November 1999
All the President's Men," Fine political thriller
","A fine political thriller centering on two reporters for the Washington Post covering the Watergate scandal and trying to uncover the truth. Excellent script backed by fine directing and acting. Excellent performances all around, most notably Hoffman and Redford. A really good movie recommended for fans of political movies or good dramas.",Null,2,3,13 December 1999
