Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good start for THE Saga
","Although the critics of TPM were awful, I believe that it is a great movie and defenetly one of the best of 1999. I admit that to fully enjoy the film you should have seen the old trilogy. Except that and the fact that Jar-Jar might have been a LITTLE annoying, the film was great. The FX ( both sound and visual) were the best IÂ´ve seen yet in a movie, the acting was not great but good to say the least, the soundtrack was G-R-E-A-T (Probably the best soundtrack ever) and the Lightsaber duel at the end was the best of all the films. Basically, the only lack of The Phantom Menace was the unique, the one-and-only, the true star of Star Wars, Darth Vader. B.t.w. Palpatine IS Sidius",10,0,0,8 January 2000
