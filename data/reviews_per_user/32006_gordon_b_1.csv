First Man," Stunning
","Superb riveting film, with human undertones. Watched it in a cinema in New Zealand. As Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, the cinema was rocked with an earthquake. Nobody was going to leave the cinema. Quite a moon landing. On a technical side, not a slide rule in sight, and the moonshot was all pre calculator days.",10,0,1,30 October 2018
