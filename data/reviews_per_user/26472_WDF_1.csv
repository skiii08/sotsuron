The Blair Witch Project," great original psychological horror movie
","I saw this movie after hearing all of its hype and I was worried if it could deliver.  It did.  While I can easily see why some people would not like it (the shaky camera, leaving the terror to the imagination, etc.), I do think it is something that has to be approached with an open mind.  The film builds the suspense slowly, but by the end the last 10 minutes are the scariest 10 minutes ever put to film!  Congratulations to the filmmakers for making a completely original film experience.",Null,1,1,23 July 1999
