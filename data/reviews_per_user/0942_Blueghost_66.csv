Blade Runner 2049," Not that good
","This film is not that sophisticated. It's pretty low on scifi film IQ scale. And yet there were people applauding the thing when it ended last night at the San Francisco Meteron.Anyone who read comics in the 70s and 80s will recognize the plot points in this film, and will know just how cliché and predictable this film was and is.A 'cop' going after a rogue AI. Okay, fine, but wasn't the whole idea behind Replicants from the first film was that they were sociopathic, and that after a while they developed emotions they didn't know how to deal with? That's never really explored in this film, but it's kind of implied that you have some kind of loose knowledge of this in order to understand (so to speak) some of this film's story's basis. Truly this film's basic tale comes out of the graphic novel boom of the late 1980s, when the audience who read superhero comic books were holding onto their childhood icons and continued to buy more of those publications. The producers of said material put out more comics with slightly more sophisticated or adult material (and no, I don't mean sexually explicit, just stuff that had romance with some sex hinted at). That's pretty much all this movie is, and with a villain who is pretty cliché and one-dimensional.I could hit on this thing scene by scene, and break it down as to just how predictable and actually unintelligent this film is, but I'd probably violate the 'don't tell' rule.This film puts on the pretense of being high-minded, but is just fairly slow. And even the 'big finale' wasn't much of a surprise, again as if Frank Miller or one of the other noted comic book authors had written this film. For anyone who's read his work (say the 'Dark Knight' series from the late 80s), you'll know what I mean when I say that this new Blade Runner puts on a presentation of being about more than what it actually is.Little of the important matters are resolved in the end, and all you get is this very female oriented payoff at the end of the film. Science Fiction is supposed to be about ideas, ideals, and the such challenged with radical changes in society and technology. That's what films like 'Planet of the Apes' or 'Outland' or any of the classic 1960's Star Trek episodes are all about. If you want to tell a soap opera, then go see one of the old standbys like 'General Hospital' or 'As the World Turns', but leave my genre alone.I truly wish I could write and say more in this review, but again I'll get slapped by the powers that be for potentially ruining the film going experience for anyone inclined to go anyway after reading what I've written here.Oh Roger Ebert, where are you when we need you...",Null,7,12,18 November 2017
The New World," Wow.
","Next to Kurosawa, to me, this film, is what film making is all about. I've rarely seen such artistry put up on screen for a touching film about a time that rarely see.What we have here is a very documentary like approach to the goings ons of late renaissance England and its exploratory adventure into the Americas. We're treated to a visage of a time after the collapse of the great native American empires that were only rebuilding, and a cultural collision of old world explorers come to find a passage to the East Indies.The acting is convincing. The camera work intimate. The lighting natural. The art direction superb. We're fed a tale of two worlds meeting, unsure of how to size up the other, and then, finally, loving and resenting each other's presence all at the same time, as international relations takes precedence over matters of the heart.A retelling of the Pocahontas tale, this very vividly imagined and executed photo-play misses few marks. I had avoided seeing it for a number of reasons, but finally took a chance on it, and was very impressed with the overall artistry and assemblance of talent that was injected into this effort. For all that, the film is a bit slow, but that's part of its charm.Well, as usual I'm a day late and a dollar short to seeing and commenting on one of the great films of our time. But such is life.If you haven't seen it, and are by some chance reading my review, then do yourself a favor and take a chance on this one.Enjoy.",Null,0,1,17 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'Sooner or later, you have to leave home...'
","Sayeth the artist who created this sprawling epic.However, that doesn't mean you have to sell the family farm. But, if you're the son of a slave, then it's a pretty good way to get out of a bad situation. It's an amazing film from a lot of technical and artistic viewpoints, however unlike the previous films that tell a portion of Lucas' saga, these are aimed at a younger demographic; grade schoolers as opposed to teenagers. Hence the reason there's a bit of a shift in demographic appeal, and perhaps, to this end, some hopes were dashed by older viewers.Me, I found them interesting, and having been a sci-fi geek growing up, one who had his share of appetites for things Star Wars, I went and saw them. My opinion is that I can like them for what they are, but the film was clearly not aimed at my age group, but more at the children of my age group. It's the kind of film that's meant to be family oriented, and also full of adventure and wonder, as is the case with all the Star Wars films.Now, having said that, I'll repeat what I saw some eleven years ago when I first reviewed this film (and made the spoiler thing popular I might add... but that's another story for another time), and that is I still enjoy the first couple of films as solid stand alone movies that have some connection. There was a kind of grittyness and 'realism' and sense of fun and adventure that all audiences enjoyed; young and old. They were a big hit with the teenagers, but adults loved them as did younger kids. And, to reiterate my review and thoughts from 1999, I can still watch those films and enjoy them as an adult.Which is puzzling on a certain level, because a film, if it's good enough, no matter who it's aimed at, will appeal to everyone. This newer Star Wars film doesn't, but that was intentional. And I think this is where a lot of the fans split with one another, get irate and agitated. The films, historically, have never been considered great works of art, but have been touted as good solid entertainment.So it is with The Phantom Menace. It's solid entertainment, but this time the film's creator is looking to entertain a younger generation. Is that bad? I suppose in the larger scheme of things it really isn't, but the groundedness of the original films seemed to have gotten lost in the shuffle, thus the audience is presented a world that is slightly brighter, shinier and more colorful than expected. For me, I must admit, as many Star Wars fantasies as I've had over the years, I do have to say that I find the film interesting enough to own in my DVD collection.As for the title's meaning and all of the other subtleties in the movie, there's some wisdom here, but it doesn't seem very subtle.Then again, maybe that was intentional as well.Either way, give it a shot. Enjoy it for what it is, or move onto something else.p.s. but if you inherit a wealthy attractive waterfront home, try to hold onto it! Nor should you be forced from the home you love.",Null,0,3,8 May 2010
The Sound of Music," Delightful
","I have a confession to make. I helped torpedo this film's rep in the late 90s on a couple of other BBSes in the late 90s by making fun of it in a light hearted sort of way. After that I remember every one getting on the band wagon and stating how silly they thought the movie was. My poking-fun had 'gone viral' so to speak. Well, I won't say what I did, but it was one of the last major cultural influences my posts would have for a very long time. Now that the net is a bit more democratized I don't have to worry about my words hitting major network outlets like they used to. Fortunately 'The Sound of Music' was resilient enough to endure a little ridicule.But I digress. To the film.This is essentially a musical remake of a German film entitled 'The Family Von Trapp', which tells the same story with less music and more drama. The Rogers and Hammerstein version was another Hollywood take on Nazi Germany, but keeps the fair light as it is understood when the deplorable political situation was in Germany, ergo the focus is on the Von Trapps and their escapade to form into a family and leave Austria which is under the German sphere of influence.I've always loved this film as a film. I'm a guy who's comfortable enough with his masculinity to say that I liked the song and dance numbers in this film, and have always done so. So, when I 'paid homage' to the songs in this film in the late 90s, I wasn't trying to ridicule the film, nor create the social tidal wave of 'that musical movie is silly and stupid' (which, again thankfully retreated into obscurity), but I was honestly trying to just use some well know references in the film in other forums. I think the songs, the story, and just over all production values are first class. And one could expect no less from one of Hollywood's first class directors, Robert Wise. The man who brought us 'West Side Story', 'Run Silent, Run Deep', 'The Desert Rats' and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' to name but a few of his landmark films.Julie Andrews gives us a free spirited novice who is trying desperately to become a nun by showing her devotion to what she loves most about living; the great outdoors and the music that it inspires within her. Christopher Plummer is in his prime when he portrays Captain Von Trapp, formerly of the Austrian Navy, and we can see his serious side as an actor come forth, along with an underscoring of tenderness.The supporting cast all do their parts to help sustain and suspend both the film's reality and the reality we are trying to escape when we watch the 'Sound of Music'. No one misses a cue here in terms of performance, and performances carry this film from frame one.Technical notes; on the DVD documentary it is mentioned that Captain Von Trapp did not like the Nazi regime for a variety of reasons, but this is only every touched on in one dramatic scene, and the emotional thrust of the captain's position is given, but we are not privy to the more real and pragmatic reasons of why and what makes him and us not like the Nazis in the first place. But, the film works regardless, because it is a musical and not a political diatribe. The cinematography is basic, but also breathtaking, particularly in the opening sequences. We are given some very inviting panoramic vistas of settled regions within the Alps-incredible stuff. The musical numbers are well crafted and help suspend reality outside the film to make the fantasy we are watching more inviting and enjoyable. If I had one critique, it's the same critique that I have with all films prior to 1970; studio rear-screen projection car shots. I remember the hack tour guide at Universal telling us how 'realisitic' this process was when shooting a scene that required the actors/characters be inside a moving vehicle. My reaction then is as it is now; give me a break. If you need characters in a car, then put them in a car and have a grip truck tow them with a camera mounted on the back, or mount a camera on the car itself, and let the actors drive for goodness sake.Otherwise the film is marvelous. If you're in the mood for some light entertainment, something with familial appeal, that has some seriousness to it, but is not weighed down by political overtones, then give 'The Sound of Music' a chance.Until then; so long, fare well, alveterzane, good bye.",Null,2,8,26 November 2012
50 First Dates," Well, I finally saw it.
","I'm not sure what to say about it, other than I thought there would be a different ending to this film.I remember the ads for this film years back, and I remember thinking what a funny film it promised to be. But, like a lot of Sandler's offerings, I just didn't find it, nor him and his dialogue, all that funny.Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm just getting too darn old for comedies, but I still laugh at other films that don't have body function jokes, or swearing, or a target demographic audience in mind. And ultimately I think that's why I found this film to be a flop.To anyone who reads my reviews you'll note that I do have a pretty high standard when it comes to films, but for a film that's supposed to be some kind of romantic comedy, why oh why is there a gag in there about a walrus and its body functions? Why is that funny? It actually isn't, and I'll bet the people in the theatre probably didn't laugh at the gag so much as at the ridiculousness of some director putting something that was sick and disgusting into the film.Okay, to the film's story before I get too sidetracked; like I said in my opening sentences, I thought there would be a different ending, and a resolution to the main plot device that propels the entire film forward. But none such is the case. Instead we get a circumstance that is never resolved, and a romance revolving around that, which seems just ludicrous beyond belief.The 'Blue Ghost' version would have resolved Barrymoore's character, kept old fashioned comedic sense in the film, kicked the target audience oriented script out the window, and then have romance flourish more traditionally after straightening out the plot device. And, it would have been a better film.I have to admit, I'm not a big Sandler fan, but I think both he and Barrymoore are decent performers when given the right material. Sandler doesn't strike me as any kind of leading man, even in a Jerry Lewis kind of way, and given the grade-level of his material, I am still mystified by people who keep this guy's career propped up.Then again, the film isn't aimed at me. But, then again, nor were any of The Three Stooges shorts, nor any rom-com made before 1980, nor even the classic WB cartoons. And yet for some reason I find all those films funny.",Null,1,2,1 October 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic film making at its best.
","The summer of 1981 was not a memorable season save for one thing; this outstanding movie. Following in the footsteps of classic serial's that used to run in movie houses, combined with the finest film making techniques utilized in epics and dramatic classics through out the era of film making, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is more than just an homage to film's of yesteryear viewed by youngsters in movie houses across America. It is the reinvention of the classic adventure.Here we see massive and delicately crafted sets and locations. We see marquis players mixed with solid character actors. We see old fashioned cinematography coupled with effects shots to bring this high adventure film to light. There's action, there's romance, there's intrigue, there's good verse evil, it's a period piece, it's got comedy, it's even got Nazis--classic bad guys from the golden age of Hollywood.The world renowned Stanford based archaeologist Doctor Henry Jones is consulted and contracted by the US Army's Office of Strategic Services to search for a relic that Hitler believes will help him conquer the world. We're there with and his friends as he grapples and races against Axis to obtain a supernatural artifact from the time just before the Roman Empire. The national socialist regime in Germany believes such a find will help win the war.This is my favorite Indiana Jones film simply because nearly everything you see in it is real, and the acting just below over the top, while at the same time being both energetic and detached to bring us a classic adventure film. There are real convincing characters mixed in with caricatures. It's a fine combination of film making styles; a classic adventure style mixed in with a near comic book style, mixed in with classic epic film making techniques. The cost was high, but the payoff was worth it. Appropriate lenses for the right shots, truly giving us the right visual feel for the film. Truly outstanding work here in terms of bringing all technical and creative story elements together. You can rarely find a match for it in the same genre.It is a bit over the top here and there, but overall, when you sum up the scenes and the entire story and visual experience, it is a masterpiece. You can see that a lot of money was put into this project, and it shows on screen; i.e. lots of tender loving care for a classic film that mimics appropriately her 'sister ships', so to speak.Technical notes; the one thing that's bothered me about this film are the squibs for the gunfights. Particularly the full automatic fire as they were mis-timed. There's a miniature effect's sequence during the chase that's a little ho-hum. I think we the audience were still used to real cars being driven remotely off cliffs, then set ablaze or to explode while in mid flight (classic Hollywood). The backers paid extra for thousands of extras, and that's a major plus, giving the film authenticity and weight. Also, the stunts are real. Whether it's Nazi soldiers on a truck, or Harrison Ford in a pontoon aqua bi-plane, a chase through suburban Cairo or an actual U-boat as it squares off with a merchant on the high seas. Save for two or three effects' sequences, all of it is real.That, verse the last installment where the commies were the villain of the day, and nearly every shot was digitally rigged in some way. The unspoken agreement between film maker and audience member was broken by not showing a heightened reality that is 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', but a CGI experience that is 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'. This is the lesson for the film makers. But, that's another film for another review.The reactions from the actors are real in a story that is far fetched. The places and dressing of everything in the shot, as well as the shot itself, sells us the story and imagery we view on the screen. Marry some first class music to it, scored by the inestimable John Williams, and you have yourself one incredible film.A terrific film with high ideals and themes, set amidst a tumultuous time in European and world history.Definitely one not to miss.Enjoy!",Null,1,2,13 January 2013
Casablanca," A film with some plot holes, but okay entertainment.
","I'm sure I'll get voted down for this review, but oh well.Here's the reason; as pointed out in the commentary by the late great film critic Roger Ebert, what does anyone need with 'letters of transit' to get out of Vichy / Nazi occupied Morocco? Just hijack a vehicle of some kind and get the hell out of there. How come nobody thought of that?As I sat through the entire movie many many years ago I kept wondering why Boggie didn't whip out his gun and just force some cabbie to take him and Garbo out of the nation ... south along the African Coast to some sleepy village and wait out the war, or at least long enough to book passage to the states for the both of them. But then again I attended SF State and not USC nor UCLA, so what the heck do I know?But the whole films like that. It's a reflection on a romance gone sour by the fact one of the parties, all those years, had a romantic obligation to someone else. So the whole film boils down to how much bitterness is in the lead character, and does he let that win out over 'the greater good' to fight fascism. That's pretty much the film in a nut shell.Does it work? Well, again the plot holes arise. If this film had been true to form, then the lead character might have been thrown in the slammer or just shot on the spot without the formality of an arrest. And the woman and her husband detained without question and given to the nazi soldiers. I mean, this is war. Right? But, for some strange reason there's this whole thing about dealing with formalities of getting papers and rekindling old flames for the sake of 'the greater good'. I think a better script would have been a bit more gritty, forgone the whole parading of male egos to impress the female audience, and just let it be the shoot-em-up film that it was probably in its first draft, because otherwise this makes all parties, even the allies, look like complete idiots.I mean, come on, there's an enemy of the state who's trying to escape. You know his name, what he looks like, where he's staying, who his girlfriend is and everything else. You've got some troops there and the Vichy government operates at your blessing. Are you really going to just let that dude and his lady wait it out until he can get some passport saying he can leave? No. You wouldn't.Would you throw your weight around town pretending not to notice them? Probably not. But again the film is engineered for a female sensibility. The female audience largely bought into the notion of needing a stamp of approval from an enemy power to leave. It's complete and total nonsense, but there you have it.I don't get how and why this film was made, nor why it's called a classic, because if you think about it for a couple of seconds, then the whole thing should fall apart on its own premise.Still, I suppose I should add that if you can suspend your disbelief (or even belief) for this thing, and you can buy into the whole plot to begin with, and then really wonder if Bogart's character is going to give a rat's backside about the plight of a couple of wanted people.And, finally, I'm going to get dinged for this too, but the nazi military is not the only set of bad guys we've vanquished throughout our history. They're one of the most notorious, if not the most notorious we've ever come across, but if you look at other films about international conflict, you'll note a high degree of staging put into this film. And I think that should set the intelligent viewer to wondering about this film's merits in the first place.Watch at your own risk.",4,2,8,17 September 2016
The Maze Runner," Okay teen sci-fi actioner.
","I finally saw 'The Maze Runner', and I'll be brutally honest, it didn't live up to my higher expectations and hopes, but it did deliver on what I otherwise thought it might have been.And that is it turned out to be a giant teenage market CGI film. Okay, that's not a big deal, but the story had a few loopholes, and felt like it was recycled material from classic sci-fi I grew up with in the 60s and 70s.What to say. The acting is good, the sets and locations and SFX are top notch. Everything but the plot, is good. And since this is a franchise builder, the plot is incomplete at the present time.What I wanted, what I hoped for, was an introspective film with some moments of action, but a lot of 'oohs' and 'ahh' moments of truly impressive visuals. This was not the case.Instead we get cyborg spiders that look like they were recycled from DOOM and DOOM2, some pretty basic tropes of character interaction, and a lot of story that goes absolutely no where, and will have to wait until the sequel to get resolved.Much of Hollywood is scraping to recapture teenage dollars for their product, not realizing that their target market is all but destroyed for the kind of fare they're putting out to their customers. I say that because there's little in the way of profundity in this film. It's pretty basic, and in that vein, dumbed down several shades to keep said teenage audience interested.Plot holes abound. How come the characters don't come up with a defensive plan? With a tech base that is existent, how come there aren't more believable explanations for how things got to where they are? And, would you really waste a lot of resources on a gigantic maze given the other issues in the film's world?For all of its mid-brow sci-fi intellectualism, it was an engaging film. I do have to admit that here and now. However, if I had shot it, I would have used mixed age actors (unless the source material, I'm assuming a sci-fi book, required otherwise). I would use a different monster, a different set of dangers, and slow the film some to give the characters time to reflect and come up with solutions of their own. I would address the obvious technology discrepancy, and lay out the world's problems from frame one.There just isn't a whole lot here thematically. And what isn't explained, but hinted at, you can pretty much puzzle out and guess what might be included in a sequel.The characters are somewhat likable (again, I would have preferred fully adult males and females), the setup is interesting, and the premise might otherwise have been intriguing if not for some story shortcomings.Given the massive army of production personnel required to make this thing, I'd be hard pressed to see any producer live up to flipping the bill for a second installment.It's not a film I would dismiss, nor a film I would highly recommend, but it is a film that I would say each person should watch on their own and decide for themselves. It's got that kind of quality to it. Technically healthy, but somewhat lacking in deeper story meaning.Give it a shot if you need some sci-fi action on your TV or computer screen.",Null,0,0,8 November 2015
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Universal Pictures message to teenagers;
","'This is how adults in their mid to late 20's behave.' Okay, I know this is another Apatow 'comedy'. Fair enough. But, the target market for this film isn't the adult 20-something crowd. The target market for this movie are adolescent and pre-adolescent males.Which is amazing, since the film is supposed to be adult in nature, but really dives to the bottom of the cesspool with the sight-gags and some of the other obvious humor.Having said that, and having thoroughly disapproved of most of this film, I can safely say that I did laugh a few times. I mean, even though this film had the F-bomb being dropped during much of Act I and a good part of Act II (probably rivaling Pacino's use of the word in 'Scarface'), the funniest lines seem to come out of the Aldous Snow character. Lines which, I'll add, didn't contain any cussing.Look. I swear. Most of us do. But there's a time and place for everything, and even though I worked in production where swearing was taken to a whole new height (above and beyond sailor usage... in the classical sense), I have a hard time believing that the film makers think most of the public uses this kind of language on a habitual basis. But, like I say, the film's marketed towards teenagers, not really adults as such, but persons with teenage sensibilities.I guess what I mean is that this film could've been a real gem. So much more than popular opinion and some professional critical acclaim. Like Jonathan Winters says, dropping your pants for a laugh only gets you so far. And yet this is what really bothers me; using nudity as a shock comic device really isn't funny. Yet by reading the boards and comments on this film, one would think this kind of humor was comic genius.But it isn't.In fact, it's really stupid.Like I say, I did laugh at the more conventional and intelligent humor (what small portions there were), and therefore concede that this film has some funniness in it, but it's also fairly lame brained. It's like a sexually obsessed child writer was given a breakup story, and asked to write a script about it. The result is this film.Directorially, it's okay. There's a few mildly inspiring shots. The thing looks professional enough, but also misses a lot of potential. In short the shooting style is good and passing, but it's not comical.Why this film gets praises is not beyond me. But, however, it is disappointing. Had this film been released in the 'sexually liberated' 70s, it would've achieved cult-status, but, in my personal opinion, would've been voted out of the theatres via lack of ticket dollars.Call me a prude, but that's my take.",Null,2,6,8 December 2008
The Hunger Games," That which is old, is new again.
","I guess I'm just not in sync with popular teenage culture, because I kind of liked this film, but, based on the number of negative user reviews, you'd think everyone would have dismissed this thing as the next 'Gili'. Well, it is a teenage action adventure romp that skews female, so there's bound to be some disappointment among young male audience members.But, to the film. One wonders if Miss Collins, author of the series, ever read Frederic Brown, or watched classic Star Trek in the late 1960s or during its syndication run in the 70s and 80s, because the basic bulk of the story is taken right out of 'Arena' (which also saw reincarnation via an issue of 'Adam Strange' in Detective Comics). Which is okay, because it's not a clone of the story, but uses the basic plot and story written by Brown, and adds many young person and female flourishes to comment on contemporary TV watching habits, and societies' imperilment of becoming addicted to a certain type of bloodletting entertainment.The film is nicely paced, and seems to be riding a fine line of trying to be edgy, real, and young person's fair all at the same time. I think it achieves this for the bulk of the audience whose dollars they're trying to capture, but the rough and tumble sci-fi gamer who is used to blood and gore via an online gaming server (and I'm talking pre-teen boys here) might probably get little impatient with it. But, the young ladies in tonight's audience, seemed to really connect with the film.Some critiques here; in the original 'Arena' we had Captain James T. Kirk pitted against a very fake looking intelligent lizard-captain, with the goal being for said starship captains to finish each other off in a 'more civil' manner, as opposed to creating a mess in space via starship combat. In 'Hunger Games' the main characters must fight for a dystopic world, again to avoid a messy war. And that's my biggest critique; the backstory, and the setting; because I didn't get a whole lot of logic to what exactly the Hunger Games represented. There seemed to be some kind of starvation component, but it really wasn't made clear in the film, just inferred that food might be in short supply. Yet one was hard pressed to see starving citizens, and with such lush green forests, one wonders why crops aren't planted to feed the people if food is indeed in such short supply. But, that's kind of the premise of the film, so you have to buy into it to really enjoy the film itself. This verse Kirk and the Gorn who were fighting over territory.There's some symbolism going on in here. There's a hearkening back to ancient Greek heroes and gods, as well as an Asmodeus like TV producer calling the shots for the Hunger Games. Woody 'let me tie up traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge some 12 years ago' Harrelson makes an appearance as an aged vet of the games (as I digress bitterly), who relays what wisdom and beneficence that he can to the selected champions of his district.There's romance, there's intrigue, there's hand to hand combat, there's MTV like shaky-cam cinematography, some girlish moments, and even some pyrotechnics (a rarity for any film). In the original 'Arena', or rather the Star Trek adaptation of Frederic Brown's short story, Shatner gave another sterling speech at the end to the Metrons who had been pulling his strings the entire time. 'Hunger Games' does the same thing, only more cinematically, and, unlike my beloved Star Trek, does it with a female bent. Which is better, or which do I prefer? I'm not really sure. Being a starship and phaser kind of guy, you'd think I would lean towards Kirk and crew, but I think I kind of like Katniss's challenge at the end. Kirk uses a Prometheus like solution, where Katniss sticks true to Artemis' ways, even to her ultimate act of defiance to the TV producers and audience. I would ask anybody who reads this to watch Star Trek's 'Arena', and compare Kirk yelling up at the sky near the end of the episode with Katniss's gesture and solution. Technical notes; the editing is slow (thank goodness), and there're few jump cuts, which makes watching this film easy on the eyes. No digital cinematography here. This is pure film making. The costumes were interesting, and the makeup fell into the same category; trying to look appealing to young audiences while at the same time being edgy and flashy. All in all respectably shot.Not a super sterling film, but, using recycled material from a variety of sci-fi sources, with a gripping narrative, and polishing the package with a pink female bow, makes the film an interesting watch.Check it out.",Null,47,62,26 March 2012
A Bridge Too Far," '...I've always felt we've gone a bridge too far.'
","An incredible production with an all star cast riding the wave of films like 'Midway', 'Tora Tora Tora', and trying to recapture some of the glory of old war movies like 'Tobruk' or 'The Desert Fox', 'A Bridge Too Far' tells of a lesser known effort during the allied advance against the Nazi forces during the second world war.I'm guessing lots of other reviews have tapped on the history upon which this film is based, so I'll skip that. But it's important to understand the context in which this film was made. As others have mentioned on the bulletin board and in reviews, there seems to be a bit of an anti- war message going on here. I think that's fair, but I also think it's important to know that this film was not only trying to recapture the spirit of the old war films, but was in fact also following the anti- Vietnam war movement, both conflict and social upheaval regarding the US inheritance of what started as a French colonial struggle had ended a few years before. But the imagery, hype and reality of the Vietnam conflict was still fresh in American minds, as well as our allies.So when the film makers set to produce an old fashioned World War 2 film, they kept the modern anti-war sensibilities in mind. Ergo we get a lot of exposition regarding the human struggle as the conflict, specifically Operation Market Garden, rages on. We're treated with various scenes that sometimes don't always move the plot and story forward, but are intended to add a human dimension. The subtext is that paranoid egos dictate the scale and nature of the conflict, and that only the truly mad engage in such operations.Untrue of course, but it is art. If conflict on any scale were only initiated by the insane, then we wouldn't have bar fights or fights at sporting events, nor gang warfare in urban hubs. Warfare is an extension of those basic human traits, and as such groups of humans wage it against one another when resources (tangible and political) are denied them. That's the thing that's really missing in a lot of war films, or films about any kind of conflict. It's perhaps unfair of me to put such a comment onto a film like 'A Bridge Too Far', because the film itself deals with a specific battle, and not geo-politics of the time. We understand the context of the war itself; its origins and reasons for its conflation, and so we don't get a background history telling us why the Allies are fighting the Nazis. We understand that, so we're presented with a table setup to show us the struggle, exterior and within.Does the film achieve its goals? When I first saw years and years ago the one element that really hit me was the struggle of the British detachment at the bridge. What they do and how both history and film unfold for them is something that will touch the military heart.As for the anti-war elements, they're there. Some are impressive, but seem very much out of place, where others seem appropriately functional within the story itself. Again, the real history of the war was that the Nazis were trying to hold onto mainland Europe, taken through military conquest with the hopes of building an European empire. The social format for the Nazi (short hand for National Socialist) regime based upon a doctrine of ethnic superiority, and in this way a sense of entitlement. Without that knowledge 'A Bridge Too Far', today, seems like a boisterous war film with some anti-war sentiments. I'm sure that was the original intent.But does it work? As a film it's entertaining. As a message on the horrors or war, or of human psychology as to the causes of death and destruction, I think it's a failure. As an examination of the plot elements that saw what went wrong with operation Market Garden, it's mildly successful. As large as the battle scenes and other scene requiring massive amounts of extras were, there were some other scene that could've used more extras, specifically Sean Connery's sequences. You never get the sense of the size of his forces. Ditto with some of the German sequences as well. The Nazi forces are essentially a nebulous enemy to be taken on. We know the scope and emotional-size of the allies, but not their opposition. So there we see a bit of a discrepancy in size portrayal. All in all a decent watch. Give it a spin on the old DVD player.",Null,1,2,2 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Star Wars as intended.
","I remember George Lucas stating that he was making a children's film with his first Star Wars movie, and although that was the intent, I think that film was one of the great film making accidents in history, because pretty much everyone loved it. It didn't matter what age you were, nor your personal background, the film was enjoyable on all levels. It had no sexual moments, no excessive swearing, but lots of action and thematic intrigue.With 'Return of the Jedi' I think we get a vision more true to what George Lucas was aiming for in terms of a target demographic. Simply put this movie is a bit warmer than the previous two. The first film was truly a classic science fiction film with a kind of fairy tale setting or background. The second film was a dark second act challenging the characters. The third film is a reunion bringing about mostly happy conclusions to lots of circumstances.In Jedi we aren't given nor shown lots of angst and extreme weighty matters. We see endings, deserved and expected, and some realizations, which add emotional weight (perhaps unnecessarily) to the complete story Lucas wanted to tell the world. To this end it's almost Wagnerian not only in terms of scope of the story (that is, it's actual size) but in terms of the connections and back story that is revealed.My one real critique of Jedi is that the live action sequences are not as well shot as the first two films. But perhaps that's unfair, because few can compete with Carole Ballard's magnificent lensing from the first film, and the exceedingly competent Kirshner's direction of the second Star Wars film is unsurpassed. With Jei the shots are a little more basic and feel more staged than the previous films. I think that, more than anything else, perhaps weighs the film some, and in the minds of die hard Star Wars fans, keeps it a notch or two below the previous films in terms of esteem. The first film had dramatic shots. The second film had intriguing shots. The third film, apart from the live action SFX sequences, has functional shots. That, more than anything else, perhaps holds back a better film. One wonders how Carole Ballard would have shot Jedi.There's criticism of the Ewok characters as being too implausible (cute, fury, appealing, etc.) to muster an Opposing Force to the Imperial Elite occupying Endor. But again, I think some of the previous feelings generated by the look of the film add a sense of warmth that counters the dramatic conclusion of the film by adding another layer of warmth to the newly introduced native forces for the Rebels. That is it isn't so much the Ewoks that the Star Wars fans object to (though that's what they state), but perhaps their execution combined with the basic look of the film from the previous hour, that's resonating with a Star Wars' audience.To get back to the lensing, there's a number of matte paintings that have always bugged me in this film. I won't point them out, but, if anything were to have been done for the special edition, it would have been nice for those elements to have been cleaned up, tweaked, or just altogether replaced.All of this is Monday morning quarterbacking. When you're in a production it's difficult to step back and see what later on becomes obvious. The script, plot and story are fine. The special effects are impressive, but the direction appears to be a little basic though highly competent, and perhaps this is the other element that holds back a more fantastic conclusion to our favorite space opera saga. As it is now, the film is great as is, but there's a couple of hidden missteps that perhaps resonate subconsciously with viewers.Even so, this is a children's film, as was always intended. As such it does have a slightly sugary feel to it. It lacks the 'realism' or grounding that helped us link to the first two films. Combine that with the other elements I mentioned, and you get Jedi. But, regardless, we get to see our favorite characters reunite for one last adventure, and that itself should bring a smile to the viewers' face.We see more derring do, incredible action sequences, and revisit our favorite heroes and villains, and the galaxy in which they reside and fight for. That makes it a great film unto itself.Relax and enjoy.",Null,0,0,3 April 2012
Megamind," Good Strong Family entertainment :)
","I just got back from seeing 'Mega Mind', and have to say that I really enjoyed it. Even though it was in 3D, the glasses did not darken the image. At least not too much anyway. Did this need to be in 3D? Not to my way of thinking, but it didn't hurt the film either. This film has strong quick witticisms that will have a full packed house laughing through much of the first 20 minutes. We have a basic story with a psychological twist, that only gets better as it goes along.There are parts that are a bit over the top, even for a CGI super-hero comedy, but the film doesn't suffer too much for it. I think it's good solid entertainment, but I think I would only take in another showing if I was with a group of friends and family.Beyond that, 'Mega Mind' offers a new twist on the super hero craze over the last several years, and should delight most family audiences. Please note however that the music can be a bit loud, and some smaller ears suffered for it in the form of crying and tears in the theatre. Not a big deal. That's what parents are for :) The rest of us without kids should be tolerant given the venue.All in all a good watch. If you have a space $14 burning a hole in your pocket and a free weekend afternoon, give it a shot.Enjoy!p.s. one critique, one of the characters at the end should have made a bigger showing than he did.p.p.s. some of the writing is almost too clever. I got all the humor, but thought it was almost surreal as to how intelligent witty some of the characters were portrayed as being.",Null,0,1,21 November 2010
Tangled," Excellent family entertainment.
","A few days ago I saw 'Megamind', and thought it was just okay. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I didn't think it too spectacular. My faith in CGI entertainment was on the wane.Well, tonight Disney pulled me from that depression, and help reinvigorate my belief in, well, just plain Disney.What we have here is Rapuntzel turned on her head, with a dash of 'Snow White' and 'Sleeping Beauty' stirred in to keep our interest.The film was charming, clever and witty without being too much of either. The comic timing was toned down for the young kiddies in the audience, mostly little girls and some younger boys, but the comedic aspect itself did not lose luster for this. If anything it showed just what good clever comedy was. Note Rapuntzel's improvised weapon, and how she brings it to bear on the baddies in the local tavern. Classic character sketch comedy, and I don't care if I was the only one who noticed it and was laughing. You're supposed to laugh!The story itself regards fleeing the nest from a 'Mime' like character, whose interest in our heroine is less than altruistic. The dashing rogue comes in to ground the story and keep Mandy Moore's character from running amuck and falling into despair.All in all, even though a middle aged dude like myself is no where near the target audience, I enjoyed it immensely. Some criticisms; the villainess seemed marginally cliché. She had the liberated 70s woman gone bad thing going on for her, but it almost seems like we may have seen this character before. Not sure, really. The horse was extremely likable, but his rider could have played more of a role. In fact the supporting cast almost seemed as if they were denied screen time so we could revel in Rapuntzel's golden locks. For all that, and even though the action did dive into classic Warner Brother's cartoon territory, 'Tangled' does make a very respectable showing.That, and it was good to hear the voice of Richard Kiel play a big galoot who turns out to be a good guy. :)My final note is that there was a very good message for young girls at the end, and in fact anyone with some sense will have caught on to it. It's a message that won't last too long, but hopefully will serve as a reminder to those who paid attention. Remember, hair isn't everything. Regardless of color *wink*Take the family, but, if you're the father, then please, PLEASE, do not spend countless minutes like the idiot in front of me paying for his four member family with several credit cards while the ticket taker next to him managed to whiz through four or five parties of several members each for the 7:20 showing at the Redwood City theatre on Theatre Row.Yeah, if you're reading this, you know who you are. Stop being a putz!Everyone else, go see and enjoy the film :)",Null,103,129,24 November 2010
Interstellar," If Kubrick's 2001 had a good ending.
","Who can forget Kubrick's visual rendition of Arthur C. Clarke's '2001 s Space Odyssey', with it's incredibly impressive visual effects. Effects that predate CGI by several decades, and hold up to this very day.But Kubrick's masterpiece (one of many) had an ambiguous if not downright ethereal, puzzling, and some might venture 'supernatural' ending to a film whose final stages were nearly uninterpretable if you did not know the actual story Clarke had written.Interstellar takes that same kind of story vibe, but goes the distance with an ending that's a little more palatable. Only Interstellar is not the masterpiece that Kurbrick's film was. Like a lot of corporate 'art' meant for mass consumption, the casting, the story, the production value elements, to me, come across as being the product of market research.It's a hollow film that tries to put heart into a story that really doesn't have a heart. Instead there's an emotional plot regarding the separation and reunion of family members after a crisis separates them.One tries to be forgiving of liberties taken with stories, but there really weren't any liberties taken here. If the male lead wasn't cast because of market research, then I don't know what is. In short, that's exactly why he was cast, and why his voice was modulated. And why the dialogue for the 'hero characters' is pithy and filled with zingers as they talk to one another about technical matters.I really was groaning. Why is it that films like Secretariat, ostensibly a NON-Science-Fiction movie hold my attention, me, a big science fiction fan, and yet when a sci-fi movie comes around, I can barely stand the thing? Why is that? It's because of the aforementioned reasons.Years back I went and saw the remake of Solaris. It was far more tangible and palatable than the Russian film, but suffered very minor parallel mis steps of Interstellar. All the computers and technical stuff were nice and shiny. Well, okay, but the characters don't know everything, nor are they caught in the dark with predictable plot twists, like Interstellar, nor are they partially reliant on massive CGI vistas, as per Interstellar.Interstellar has a lot going for it, but it's all the result of corporate research, and not the product of artistry. The director was told what script to shoot, the script itself was vetted, and you can see just looking at it that there was someone standing by making sure elements A, B and C were tossed into this film to make sure X, Y and Z marks were hit.I remember from my boyhood watching 'First Men in the Moon'. It's an impossible tale about Victorian adventurers going to the moon to discover its wonders. Nothing there attempts to be scientifically accurate. Far from it. But it's a convincing and entertaining visual tale (for the time anyway ... the effects may be somewhat dated for younger viewers). But, as a film, it delivered.Interstellar feels like a very empty experience regardless of the technical wizardry and everything else that got dumped into it. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theatre, and I'm glad I was able to stream it for free off of Amazon.A better film would have done away with all the attempts to mimic past 'realistic' sci-fi, and stuck with the story. A better film would not have had to make a point of educating the audience on black holes. A better film would not have used all the god-awful cinematography and audio junk to appease to various audiences. To me Interstellar is the scifi equivalent of a politician who promises everything to everybody, and winds up delivering nothing in the end. Predictable and not worth the money.Watch at your own risk.",Null,0,2,24 June 2016
The Last Legion," A little unbalanced, yet respectable entertainment.
","Like Variety said at the conclusion of their review, I really wanted this film to be better. I tried to see it in the theatre, but by the time I got around to going out and buying a ticket the film had been yanked. So I rented it in spite of hearing mixed reviews.I liked much of what I saw, but this film was aiming to be more than what it ultimately became. Which is too bad, because even though it's a fairly solid run-in-mill actioner, it really could have been so much more.There're elements of Indiana Jones, some Kill Bill, along with a dash of 300, all of which ultimately are riding the revived epic-genre courtesy Pete Jackson's LLLord of the Rings effort. And perhaps that's what holds back this pic from being a much better movie.In short, what you have here is more market-tested stuff. The young audience wants to see martial-arts action, and so the studio orders the director to put it in. Which is bizarre, since the backers dumped nearly 70-million dollars into this thing to show some strange combination of eastern martial-arts action and fantasy mixed into what used to be called a 'sword-and-sandal' epic.My reaction; 'Huh?' One wonders if this film made a profit, or if it will be remembered years from now like 'Spartacus' or 'Cleopatra' or 'Ben Hur'. Probably not. Which is a shame, because if the film makers had just stuck to the basic rules of making a Roman Epic this thing could've shined like Gladiator or Braveheart. But, it is regrettably aimed at younger audiences. And by this I don't mean it was missing graphic bloodshed, but it could have used a most mature approach to staging the one on one action scenes, instead of trying to present a faux Quentin Tarantino sequence to keep the film interesting for teenage boys.The acting itself is okay. Firth as usual realizes his full potential, and Kingsley gives us a seer with true conviction. The rest of the cast do well, but no Oscars will be found.The settings are fine, the sets are fine, the art direction is actually fairly top notch. But because the director was told to include certain elements into this film, and was told to take it in a certain direction, the film misses a finer mark.Example; the opening action sequences do foretell what will culminate in the final climactic third act showdown. In fact it's pretty lackluster. The fall of a major urban hub that's the center of civilization is no mean feat. Yet we're only shown a small segment of what has to be a colossal confrontation between two armies; the Goths and the Garrison of Rome. The PG-violence doesn't bother me, but the scale of the battle (lack of cutaways to other parts of the city and so forth), create a knowing frown for the viewer. Wouldn't it have been nice to see the Romans in their full glory at opening of the film? Also, given the cinematography in the opening sequence, one is led to believe that this is going to be a serious epic. Costumes, sets and performances are top notch, but the catering to young boyish sensibilities truncates a more majestic quality that's never realized. As I alluded to before, instead we get derring-do replete with narrow escapes and martial arts' moves that look like they were lifted from a Hong Kong Kung-Fu B-movie.The historical accuracy/inaccuracy doesn't bother me a great deal. This is, after all, a film about legend, but I was somewhat taken aback that there weren't more Christian references given this particular period of the Roman Empire. It wasn't too important, but a mention of Roman culture (either pagan or Christian, or some state of flux in-between) could have gone a long way to helping ground this film.It is ultimately a film that's aimed at late-grade school to middle school aged boys, so the liberties taken with the genre aren't too surprising. But I've yet to hear praise of this film by those who specialize in catering healthy offerings to youth. I think largely because this film tries too much to cater to everyone. It's an epic; it's an action film; it's a love story; it's a 'fantasy' film; it's a period piece and so on.All in all I happen to like it, but only marginally. Like I said in the opening, I really wanted this to be a better film. Respectably shot, the teetering from one genre to the next, along with a few leaps in logic from one plot point to another (notably the lack of buildup to the opening battle scene) hampers the film.If you have a spare evening, want to see some Roman sword play on your screen, then you might want to give this thing a chance. But, keep in mind that it is a film aimed at a younger audience, and might not satisfy your expectations for a true classic epic.",Null,0,3,15 February 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Silly but endearing and entertaining.
","I went through my geek phase of loving fantasy, but never felt myself too attached to places and characters that were not part of this Earth, but loved reading about them all the same. Ditto with Tolkien's works, including his non Middle Earth writings. I, like a lot of other people, hoped someone would make a movie out of his books someday, and someone did.Me, I just can't take the story too seriously because it is essentially updated mythology. Parables about why the environment is dangerous hail from a different time, and we now understand why there's thunder and lightening, what stars actually are, how tidal waves and earthquakes are created, and whole slew of natural phenomenon that weren't only scary in terms of the danger they present (as they still are today) but were otherworldly and supernatural in power to our ancestors, who had little understanding of the natural world.With science-fiction (read that as good science fiction) it's a different story. The fantasy is still there, but the foundation isn't founded in losing oneself in divine or near-divine powers, but with the presumption that we understand how the physical world works. With fantasy you presume that you know the basics; water runs, wood burns, wind blows, boats float, but beyond that you're intentionally in the dark. So it is that Frodo and company galavant beyond their quaint home of the green Shire, and into the mysterious and dangerous depths of darkest Middle Earth.We're there with them to explore and experience the dangers and wonders of a world created by one of the great literary minds of our time, J.R.R. Tolkien. A man who took his knowledge of Norse mythology and melded it with his knowledge of folklore, religion, and his personal views on warfare and honor. We thus have a parable of friendship and the pitfalls of 'industrialized warfare', where the conflation between rival powers sucks in and destroys those who have no interest in what is essentially a personal struggle between 'supernatural' personae. Persons who are never fully presented in this work.For the lay non-Tolkien fan, the 'War of the Ring', about which the films and books present and address, is an extension between Tolkien's version of the Christian god Eru Illuvitar and Morgroth (his personification of Lucifer). Morgroth had a servant, Sauron, who, after his masters vanquishing, took it upon himself to conquer Eru's creation. The films and books give us a slice of that conflict, and also present its final stages. In this sense (and by Tolkien's own admission in several interviews) we're seeing an homage to the King James bible as interpreted by Tolkien himself.Pete Jackson, obviously a Tolkien fan, has taken the works and put them in a splendid visual piece with a top rate cast and production team. No expense is spared to bring us the Shire, Mordor, Gondor, Rohan and places beyond. We're there with the characters as they jump from one situation to the next in an attempt to rid the world of evil (or a good portion of it) by carrying out a specific task.It's good entertainment, but like all films, you can't take it seriously. Which is why I think it's silly in this regard because it does take itself seriously. I think that was more of a nod towards the fan base who really regard Tolkien's works almost as a religious codex. They're not too far off the mark in Tolkien's outlook of his work, but I think give it far more import than the author would have been comfortable with. And I guess that's why I tend to smirk, perhaps laugh, at the films, regardless of how much I think they're okay in terms of movies unto themselves. But we're not supposed to question the physical reality of the world presented, just accept it and the drama. And perhaps that's all anyone can really do.Still, the seriousness of the actors, the angst of the direction, and overall gist, to me at least, seems ever so marginally over the top. It's as if everything here is ultimately serious, with serious consequences that need to be regarded with serious demeanor. But we know it's all hokum, and I think even the characters, were they alive and real, would tacitly nod in agreement. Still, the technical and artistic direction is many levels above anything I've ever seen, and I applaud Peter Jackson for making such a sprawling fantasy epic. Truly an impressive production on every level.But, like I say, as a film it's great, as a comment on anything we can relate to in the real world, it's clouded in mythos, which means that it's more than just immediately detached by the fantasy setting, but also set apart in terms of real world causes for war and strife.All in all, a decent enough film.",Null,0,0,7 March 2011
Cold Mountain," Amazonian
","I heard lots about this movie. I rented it when it came out on DVD. Watched it. Thought it was well shot. Well staged. Well acted. Well directed. Heck, even the script was good.But there was something missing.What was it? Oh yeah, the guy got shot in the end, and his wife winds up with the good life.We live in a day and age where the marketers are chasing social trends. Social trends in turn feed off of the marketing that affects society. One synergizes with the other. It's a chicken and egg thing. One follows the others' trend, hoping to cash in. Who's in the lead? I have no idea. But the morning news, the soap operas, the game shows, nearly everything you can think of is aimed at garnishing dollars. And 'Cold Mountain' was no different.Consider; Law goes off to fight in the war while Kidman stays home. Not a big variance in theme there, but Law's character gets challenged with the harsh brutality of Civil War, while Kidman's character, though facing her own challenges at home, isn't quite so fretted with what could happen to her so much as what could happen to her neighbors. We see one love making scene after Law's character comes home, and then a violent confrontation. And Law get's shot. Kidman? She goes on to live a happy and fruitful life now that she's been given a child from her alleged love of choice. I don't know about you, but it seemed more like Kidman's character was waiting to be fertilized than to protect her man.Is this worrisome? Not really. If any feminist thinks this is a good message, then they're off their rocker. Me, I found it trite. A much better film with much the same story, better production values, and just scoring higher marks in the theme and values department, is Ang Lee's 'Ride With the Devil'.Lee's film tells a better story; the harsh non-mystical realities of tribal warfare, and why men and women need each other, and why they create families that need one another as well. It's a story of survival to keep the hope of romance and family alive. In short, it's a better film on all levels.'Cold Mountain' is sophomoric pablum. It's aimed at the 'Sex in the City' crowd, only designed to ride on the coat tails of other historic Civil War success stories.And that's why I didn't take a liking to 'Cold Mountain'. The film should've been renamed 'Cold Women', for not one man of worth survives to the end of this film. And the one man who should have, was shot in the gut, and needlessly so.I guess you could say I don't really like this film much.Watch it for its aesthetics, but then understand what you've seen after it's all said and done. It's an angry film for an angry segment of the sexes.",Null,2,4,16 August 2010
Coriolanus," Good flick.
","I just got back from the Landmark theatre in San Francisco off Market Street, where I saw Coriolanus. A decent enough film with a few marketing elements in it.I know how to make this movie better, but am going to refrain from saying so, because I am going to make a better film. This one was good, but could've been tweaked.It would've been neat to see 'SPQR' written somewhere. The whole momma's boy thing was kind of odd, but I'm guessing that's more of a fault of the director than De Vere's authorship. This film could have been more than it ultimately became. I'm wondering why it was so restrained.Regardless, go see it. It's worth a night's viewing.",Null,0,6,26 February 2012
Ender's Game," Boring and tiresome, with little to offer.
","Another psychological formulaic movie aimed at the non-athletic pre- teen to post teen who has an interest in science and does well in academics, and plays lots of online RTS computer games. In other words, this film was aimed at the proverbial male 'nerd'.I'm a middle aged male who still plays computer games because I think they're fun, like a lot of males my age. I grew up with a generation that appreciated science, but also appreciated a good action film and athletics. There are a good chunk of adult males of a variety of ages who are not protein starved emaciated men who think of nothing but science and games. Those people are a minority.Yet this movie, and the book upon which it was based, treat the audience as if it were the majority of the audience in the theatre. And, on top of that, even goes on to create an 'empowerment scene' where the young male protagonists stands up for himself in a very physical scene. How tiring.If you go to any college or university science lab, you'll note that the majority of the young scientists in training are regular normal people, male and female. In fact, you'll probably find several jocks in those classes, or even detectives or administration of justice majors learning about basic science as they pursue a career in forensics. The point being that the audience for whom this film was made, does not exist, or does not exist in the numbers both author and film makers think exists.As such we get a film that's slow moving for the sake of it. Goes way overboard in looking at character development. Does not take one moment to look at 'the bad guys' in any way, shape or form until the very end, and even then it's cursory at best, and leaves the audience wondering what they just watched.Well shot, reasonably acted, and a lexicon that's at the 6th grade level for dialogue, this film is destined to be another early 2000s film that relied way too much on CGI, and did absolutely nothing with basic film making tools.This film, if nothing else, should prove to Hollywood, London, Taiwan, Tokyo, Berlin, New York and even San Francisco, that the age of the sci-fi spectacular is dead. The film industry fell behind computer games (note; NOT video games, but online strategy games for the PC and Apple) in the 90s, and has been trying to grab young dollars ever since with bigger, splashier, and I'll add, a worse slew of films than the awful American International films that came out in the 1960s.I've been playing RTS games since Dunce and Warcraft 1, and continue to indulge in them (though less frequently) with Starcraft 2 and Homeworld. And I can tell you right now that no amount of CGI wizardry replaces good characters and story, which this film lacks. Oh sure, the film makers try to create drama with over-the-top moments for the main character, and an idiotic parable at the end given the nature of the alien attack, but marry these with lukewarm CGI, and what do you have?Finally, this movie attempted to mimic the Kubrick film making model with a nod towards the act structure of 'Full Metal Jacket', even to the point of trying to mimic a few scenes, but again, there's a reason Kubrick was a genius. Without writing an even larger dissertation, he knew what he was doing. This director didn't.There is nothing cerebral here, though the film makes a pretense of it. There is no high drama here, though again the film makes a stab at presenting the such. There is the story of a young man (boy) who is reared on games, and Orson Scott Card's fear of what that might entail.Boring, tiresome, and absolutely nothing to offer. Avoid.",Null,1,1,23 July 2015
Aliens," Let's rock!!!!
","I don't have too much to say about this film, other than it helped confirm the flavor for many an extracurricular activity I engaged in with friends. Whether it was playing games, going to a football game, going to see an entirely different movie, or grabbing a pizza, it was always 'Let's rock!''Let's rock!' is derived from gunners in fire teams expressing their ability to lay down support fire in a fire fight. The gunner in the past was armed with an M-60 machine-gun based on the old German 88 design. 'Let's rock!' means to cut loose with heavy sustained fire, or to return fire when engaging an enemy that's firing upon you. So it is that Vasquez, one of the support gunners in the platoon return's fire when the movies bad guys make themselves known.I don't have too many criticisms of the film other than some of the miniatures don't hold up when translated to the small screen. That's a problem that's as old as Godzilla films when the Japanese monsters lost their size and weight when broadcast to homes. The majesty of the size of seeing something on the big screen adds visual weight to miniature, and when shrunken down, not everything in the shot translates. That happens here, but not always.The characters and their presentation border on Hollywood's cliché Central Casting, but get their point across with a strong solid story. Weaver returns as Ripley, she meets up with a combination of military and company heads to discover what has happened to a colony.If I had a criticism about this film, and I don't have many, it's firstly that Bruce Cmaeron films tend to be over the top in dramatic content. Just when you think things are settled there's another challenge to be met. Just when you think the last of the aliens has been dealt with, there's something else lurking around the corner. That works to heighten the action, but it does get predictable and wearisome after a while. Notably the same kind of film making reared its head in 'Avatar', the 3D CGI ho-hum Pocahontas in space that Cameron brought to the screen a couple of years back.The other critique that I have is more to do with Hollywood itself. Being an instrument of social mental health, Hollywood has decided that the only warfare in space that is to take place is against dumb aggressive 'evil' predators like the aliens in this film, or space- Nazis. The reason that's important is because from Avatar to Star Wars to Star Trek to name-your-sci-fi franchise, we'll never see a sequel where said same colonial (US) marines will take on a group of soldiers from another space faring state, because in Hollywood social-mental- health speak, that's a taboo concept that is actively repressed. Ergo the bad guys will always be aliens or clone storm troopers from the Star Wars (and like) films. Why is that important? Well, if all mankind has to face are aliens, dangerous animals, so to speak, then why have soldiers at all in the first place?But never mind. You're not supposed to think about that.The film is filled with lots of raw energy and lots of solid performances for leads and support thespians. No one misses a mark. And Bruce Cameron competently helms this sci-fi space-actioner to bring us a bit of horror mixed in with some military gun fights to settled score.Over the top in the story and action department, but tempered with likable and unlikable characters, this film will definitely entertain (it's the kind of film I want to see more of, but they don't make anymore).Highly recommended. See it again and again.Get your girlfriend to watch it with you...make her watch it with you and your hardcore military buddies.Enjoy.",Null,0,1,27 June 2013
Mamma Mia!," 'Mamma Mia', a dude's perspective on a chick-flick musical.
","Before I dig into this film, let me say this; I enjoyed it for what it was, and to this end I liked it.Technically the stock was pushed and given a dousing in color saturation, which is helped by both sunny locations and some respectable lighting for the stage sequences. This gives the film an appropriate warm and inviting sensation that effectively marries both interior and exterior sequences. This is partially due to the effective use of green screen, which adds a kind of transitional imagery from the lush Greek exteriors to the brightly lit stage sets that represent the heart of the hotel where the film takes place.I don't have too much to say about ABBA's music. I liked ABBA's music, and still do, but have never felt the urge nor need to buy any of the albums. I understand the music being used as a basis for a musical, but, like a lot of songs taken from popular music circles and culture, there is a retrofit feel to some of the numbers. I never got the sense that the songs were created for the situations, which is only natural because let's face it, they weren't. But at the same time things feel a bit constructed. Maybe if I saw the stage play my opinion would be different. I don't really know.The other thing that was somewhat jarring was seeing Pierce Brosnan being dubbed during his singing sequences. Whether he sang and dubbed himself, or someone else dubbed him, I don't know. But either way it seemed unnatural. I know why, but will refrain from espousing on the reasons.I'll say this, it was refreshing to see a musical on the big screen. After so many action films, sci-fi flicks, sex-comedies, and other popular genres, it felt like a relief to see something striving for cinematic originality in terms of bucking the movie making trend. I can't recall the last time I went to see a musical at the movies. Heck, I think the last time saw one was Disney's 'Mary Poppins' back in 1969. 'Mama Mia''s clearly not the only musical to hit the movie houses in the last 30 years, but the musical genre has been sparsely populated in the ensuing decades; 'Xanadu', 'Grease', 'Grease 2', 'Newsies', 'Popeye', 'Pennies From Heaven' ... and I guess you include 'The Guru' or even the opening sequence of 'Indiana Jones and the Templre of Doom' to a lesser extent. That verse the musical heyday of the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. In the era of yesteryear we arguably had too many (quite a few of which are laughable), but it can be so counter argued that we have too few today.Even so, I'm not a tremendous fan of contemporary musicals, largely for the reasons Gene Kelley cited when he worked on 'Xanadu'; 'These people don't know how to shoot a musical.' (or words to that effect). And that's still true. Phyllida Lloyd comes closer than other contemporary efforts (save for Randal Kleiser's translation of 'Grease' to the big screen), but her film seems more infatuated with the ladies' perspective of how to have fun than a good romantic tale. But this is probably more as a result of test screening by the studio than a genuine artistic bent.Storywise there isn't a whole lot here. As Ebert commented the plot line is there more for propelling the musical numbers, and not so much meant to deliver a parable, which is what this movie really should have done. To this end it skirts the fringes of being sexist by nearly excluding and delegating the leading and supporting males to the realm of 'objects of affection', though this was most likely done for marketing purposes.All in all I found the film entertaining, but too far skewed to be genuinely universally appealing, but nor was I offended by its direction and focus. My personally opinion is that it's probably perfectly timed for a theatre going crowd, but it could stand to be a bit longer and ever so slightly meatier.A good date film, if you're so inclined.",Null,1,2,11 August 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," It was okay.
","I'm not really sure what to say about this film other then it feels just as over the top as Jackson's take on Tolkien's trilogy a decade previous. There's tons of CGI in this thing, and I think the film suffers because of that. Whether it's the incredible vast CGI cave sets, the vistas augmented by man made CGI works, or some of the roller coaster like action sequences with more CGI, I'm not sure, but I felt a little more detached from this film than when I watched 'Fellowship of the Ring'.And I do blame the CGI in the movie. The budget's been cut, ergo we don't see actors or stuntmen dressed up as the bad guys, but CGI bad guys, and my god, I am sick and goddamn tired of allegedly photorealistic CGI. No offense to Peter Jackson, because he's doing his best to bring these marvelous tales to life, but someone brought up the idea of CGI, and there is loads and loads of CGI in this thing.CGI bad guys, CGI animals, CGI good guys, CGI vistas, cgi this, cgi that. Were it not for the documentary I would have sworn that the make up on the actors was CGI. Is that a testament to how convincing and good CGI is? Uh, no, because it is overwhelming in this film. A good use of special effects is something that doesn't necessarily look natural, but helps convey the story. Hey, all those Godzilla films in the 50s, 60s and 70s (and even today) look fake as anything, but kids tend to let Godzilla slide some because he's usually smashing stuff which, for kids (and kids at heart) is really cool. But imagine if you will, if Godzilla smashed CGI tanks, plowed through CGI buildings, then went for a swim in CGI water as he was yelled at by CGI actors. It would grate on you, guaranteed.I'm not really sure what I was expecting from 'The Hobbit', but, based on King Kong and Jackson's previous foray into Middle Earth, I'm wondering if perhaps I, and other audience members, should not have been a bit more steeled for what was to come. I think most people expected a lighter film than the heavy stuff that was the serious and angsty tone of The Lord of the Rings, and we sort of get that (after a fashion). But coupled with a ever so slightly lighter tone (and it isn't all that light given the Thorin character who carries himself as if the weight of the world were on his shoulders) we have some very dynamic action that only Pete Jacksoun could conjure, along with some drama to aggrandize the Thorin character's legend, and a dash of mental health (no surprise).All in all I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but I'm very glad I didn't waste $12 American to go see this thing in the theatre, and be forced to wear 3D glasses on top of that. I would have been really angry for a one time show for that kind of money, and my review would have been very different in tone.How could this have been improved upon? Make the dwarfs dwarfs. Allegedly in the book Hobbits were small in height and stature than dwarfs, but they appear almost the same in physical dimensions. The dwarfs also seem a bit young. So much that I'm nearly tempted to say that I almost prefer the dwarfs in the Rankin Bass cartoon from the 70s than this production. The dwarfs, to be blunt, don't seem like dwarfs. They seem like young human men from some strange fantasy town rollicking in the New Zealand wilderness.After we take care of the dwarfs, it's time to address the CGI. Do we really need all the CGI in this thing? Do we really need CGI goblins in stead of actors and stuntmen? Does their underground complex need to be as visually colossal as portrayed? I would have been happy with a sound-stage dressed up for the location and filled with several dozen actors. But that's just me. The one CGI I did approve of was the mountain pass sequence. I was wondering if Pete Jackson and his screenwriters were going to remain true to the actual description from the book, and sure enough we witness the true cause of the 'thunder' during the storm. That, even though I really didn't approve of the CGI in and of itself, was a welcome sequence.Lastly, hire some older actors. Thorin is supposed to be of some years, but we get some guy who looks to be in his late 20s. Oh boy. Get rid of the archer, let him be a slinger, inject some personalities into the other dwarfs.Look, all in all I though it was on okay movie. It entertained, and we finally get to see a 'live action' version of 'The Hobbit'. But, for all that, it would have been nice to have a production that relied less on SFX.Give it a shot.",Null,1,3,6 July 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," Well shot, huge in scope.
","I had seen this movie a few times on broadcast TV when I was growing up, but never caught the whole thing. It was simply too long, and when the ending did come it seemed rather anti-climactic. The cinematography is quite impressive, and being shot on 65mm one can't help but be impressed with the capturing of images. Beyond that I don't have too many things to say about this film. Really good movies that I like I tend to heap praises on, but for all of the superior quality this film retains, I'm not a huge fan of it other than from a technical standpoint.Thomas Edward Lawrence tackles Arabian tribalism and factionalization as he fights the Ottoman Empire and its allies in the First World War over chunks of the Middle East. The area that would become Isreal, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and so forth. The film looks at the emotional trials and tribulations of a British army officer attempting to tackle and mend ancient rifts in order to form a cohesive functioning Arab political unit.And we all know how well that worked out. But, to be fair, the movie can only give us so much as to the hows and whys of why we have the Middle East as it is today, and sticks primarily with the emotional saga that Thomas Lawrence went through in fighting wars on all fronts.In the mid 1990s I saw a documentary that explored Thomas Lawrence's personal life, and apparently, according to either a journal entry or some correspondence, Lawrence had some sexual fetishes which, for the time, would seem to socially unacceptable. The film, if you didn't know this, plays this off as Gitmo-like encounter, where Lawrence is forever changed (negatively) by the experience. According to the film.And I guess that's why I don't connect with the film. Typically the more damaged a soldier gets the more he wants out of whatever war he's been asked to fight. So, make of that what you will.I think one of the reasons I don't take a shine to this movie is because it doesn't have a good ending. It doesn't explore Lawrence himself. He's a British subject, and not much else. We're given a stock male from the UK who has a passion to see his mission succeed, but realizes his assignment is fraught with social obstacles. When I think of other epics, like Kurosawa's late comer 'RAN' or one of the Civil War films or Roman era epics, you get a sense of who the people are, and identify with them. I'm not so sure that many people identify with Thomas Edward Lawrence. Maybe initially, but certainly not in the latter stages of the film.So if you come away from the film impressed, but a little empty on a subconscious level, you're not alone. Enjoy, but watch at your own risk.",Null,0,1,22 June 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," My two bits.
","I think I pretty much said all the positives I had to say in my ROTK review. So now I'm going to vent my spleen.I like the fantasy genre for what it is, but these days when I see the overblown and overwrought tweaks to what is supposed to be a mythological genre--I don't know--it just really boggles the mind as to how things could get so out of hand.The fantasy genre is supposed to be taken from historical folklore of a thousand years past. But when one looks at the various iterations of 'elves', 'paladins', 'wizards' and other personae that are said to populate these imaginary worlds, one wonders what went wrong. Final Fantasy has their short spikey-haired over-sized-sword dude, Warhammer has their 'Fae in Space' thing going on, and, well, how does anyone buy into this crap in the first place?So what does this have to do with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series? Not much, other than the fact that Tolkien's work was built upon other works, and today's marketers have built upon Tolkien's work, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth. Until we now have huge swords, armor and weapons that could never be made, worn, and much less used. 'The Two Towers' somewhat smacks of this, but much of that is Pete Jackson's artistic license.And we need artistic license. It's what makes for good drama. But do trolls have to be twenty-five feet tall, AND wear armor? This film, like the previous film and the subsequent one, to me, suffer from a severe case of taking itself too seriously. Lots of slow motion shots, twirling camera stuff, and a sense of impending doom. Then again the Two Towers was meant to be the angst-ridden middle second act of the series.Truth is I like this film for what it is. I don't have too many gripes with it. But I do take issue with Tolkien fans who really take these films as religious dogma of sorts. I've read pretty much all of Tolkien's works regarding Middle Earth, and his lesser known publications as well. They're entertaining, but I think one would be hard pressed to find any redemption in terms of spiritual enlightenment within the text of Tolkien's thoughts.So, what are my real gripes? The whole current 'fantasy' genre as a whole. Not just Pete Jackson's corner of it, but the whole 'chainsaw swords' and magical powers with absolutely no basis in anything, deities that are physical manifestations and such... one wonders how anyone in their right mind could be a fan of this junk.The Two Towers has the benefit of being A) popular, and B) well rendered by Pete Jackson's hand. Even so the film seems a bit heavy. Darkly lit, dark mood music with few light moments, impending thesping/circumstances. Do these 'folk' (hobbits, elves, dwarfs, men, widgets, and whatever else) ever crack a smile or joke? We got a few moments of levity from the first film, but the second one, this film, seemed rather weighted with its own drama.So what's the point of all this rambling? In the days when legends about elven folk and dwarfs were first conceived and told, they were considered real entities for parables of what and how to avoid the dangers of venturing off from the village by oneself. They were meant to explain away the unexplainable. Now they're a commercial product meant to be exploited by sociopathic marketers. The Two Towers teeter in that direction, but are saved by the creative teams vision for the films.Even so, I think these films were made probably a few years before they should've been made, and I speak of none other than the CGI, which, to my eyes, looks like CGI.So, in the final analysis, what do I have to say about Jackson's version of Tolkien's Two towers? Truth is I'm not too sure. It's an okay film. It entertains. And, really, what more can you ask for?",Null,0,3,27 November 2009
The Incredibles," Good Family Fun
","I don't have too much to say about this film. It's got lots of good family stuff in it, along with a lot of good action. It hearkens back to classic James Bond films, but also adds the 'super' hero element in it.Superheros are the guys and gals with lots of incredible abilities, who go about righting wrongs and thwarting wrong-doers to uphold the law. Super-villains are the arch fiends of these people, and scheme to dominate the world and rob it blind of money.So, if you've amassed enough wealth to own your own secret island fortress, and pay lots of people to work for you, including armed guards and even a hottie who's your secretary, then why on Earth would you go about killing off the opposition?To me that's where the film fails. The main plot piece is a kid who wants to live out some revenge fantasy and show the world that he's the only true (and new) superhero, as opposed to just going on living the good life that he's created for himself. It's an emotional vendetta, and it just seems really crazy to me. That is there's this guy who had his hero jilt him, but he's gone on to become a multi millionaire (billionaire?), and he's trying to fulfill his anger wishes?Huh.Well, it is a kids' film, so you can't fault it too much, but the plot wasn't very plausible. Still, it's fun entertainment, and you gotta love it for that.Give it a try.",Null,0,0,26 August 2012
Stardust," Impressive, but where are the men?
","This chick flick fantasy was supposed to be the after thought also-ran competitor to Disney's 'Enchanted', the 'Narnia' films and 'Golden Compass', but winds up being the better film. It's an improvement on a product that is a rarity when one is trying to follow the market leader in order to sponge his run-off.The sets and situations are all fantasy, but the care taken to execute this film, particularly by hiring the ever beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer to thesp the antagonist role, is quite striking. To me this film surpasses the standard of what 'The Golden Compass' was trying to set, and also surpasses the ostensibly more young male oriented Narnia films.Do I have any quibbles with this flick? Not as such. Pfeiffer does her usual bang up job of showing us her top of the line acting talent. The film benefits from it. And unlike Nichole Kidman's film, where Kidman has to try to carry a film that seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, Pfeiffer's talents aren't the central focus here. There's a solid cast of actors with excellent acting talents who deliver us characters that stand on their own. As an entertainment piece it's a solid performer when cast and story meld with the SFX and other film elements. A thing that 'The Golden Compass' never quite achieves.Quibbles? Yes, there a few. Not many, but some. The martial arts exposition was needless. Mixing in east Asian martial arts with western saber fighting, and tossing in Kung Fu theatrics (somersaults and so forth), for me, pushes the film into the outer edges of high-kamp. Just once I'd like to see a masculine hero does what he does best. Unfortunately those days are probably long gone, so we have corporate film making placating to a female demographic.And therein lies the the film's real fault. Right now it's just a solid fantasy film. The acting level is right for this kind of flick, and the plot and story are well received, but it seems to really down play any masculine positives. Which makes one wonder about the fans of this film. Me, I happen to like the exposition, and I have the DVD in my collection, but I would've liked the male leads to have been more proactive. Such a movie would've had a larger cross market appeal, garnished a larger market share, and, most importantly of all, been a better movie as a whole.But, regardless, we do have a solid piece of cinema, even if skewed by corporate studio heads.So... where are the men? Or are they all black hats in this thing?Okay, that was overly harsh. Truth be told I do like this film a great deal. See it.",Null,3,6,21 February 2010
School of Rock," Good G-Rated fun
","I wish they made more of these kinds of films. It's refreshing to see a G-rated comedy that had kids but was also funny without having to resort to body function jokes.It's a film about accomplishment. It's a film about deception to achieve your dreams. It's a film about how children can achieve remarkable things. It's a film about how they can still make good clean movies, even if they're made with kids in mind they can still be funny without being too saccharine. I just don't get why they don't make more movies like this. Jack Black is in his usual rare comedic and terrific performance form. And the supporting cast is also dynamic, especially the kids who do a bang up job. There's a bit of three stooges here. There's a little bit of Jerry Lewis. There's a healthy dash of classic post 1950s rock injected into this film, but again clean enough that children and their parents can enjoy it. The plot is pretty basic, a conman of a want to be rock star who's on the outs with his former band and one friend, does a bit of double dealing to help bring rock to young minds, enlighten their parents, and make his way back into the thing he loves most; music.Definitely worth streaming, possibly buying the bluray when it becomes available for your library.Enjoy.",Null,8,8,6 July 2017
Moulin Rouge!," My buddy's story.
","A friend of mine went through something not too dissimilar to this. He fell for a woman who died her hair a dark red tint, who was attractive, and seemed to express an interest in him. Regrettably for him it turned out to be false. And, like Kidman's character, this woman had her set of problems, physical and emotional. But the dude, an aspiring writer, kept going back for more thinking he could win her.It didn't work out in the end. He had his high ideals about love: What it ought to be, with whom, and how it should manifest. But, like most films, the end of Moulin Rogue ends a bit more dramatically, and, in spite of the rough ending, emotionally better than my buddy's story, though, again ironically, reality turned out to be better than the film because no one died of tuberculosis (or anything else for that matter).The film shows the story of the naiveté of a young idealist writer who throws himself into the realm of the seamy Parisian underworld, and falls for a woman who only 'loves' him for what he can do for her and her confederates. During the course of the story there are some emotional twists.It's a light and fancy melodrama with some dark undercurrents that keeps the tension fun and gripping. MacGregor and Kidman have real chemistry in this kitschy effort, which again melds with the overall thrust of the film to tell us a tale of Bohemian values and their short comings in a world fraught with survivalist concerns.Realities of life color and pull at the facade of the fairy tale the characters hope to live. The dark presence, the antagonist, plays no real part in the fate of the drama, but adds much needed tension to the story (however much despised he is by the rest of the characters). In the end we see his part as being trivial at best.And therein lies the larger message of the film. Would the story have had the end had everyone followed their hearts in the first place? Would the couple have met? Would they have ended on better terms, albethey without one another? To what purpose does lording wealth, over those who need it, serve? Money truly does not buy happiness.There's a definite theme of honesty undulating here. Betrayal served a purpose for those involved, but did it serve a higher purpose? Was it worth it? This is the question the film poses to the audience.Stylistically it's a bit hard to take. The film itself is like a giant MTV music video. A high concept music promo film shot on an astronomical scale and budget. There's lots of cuts, manipulation of camera speed, miniature work and other special effects blended with some epic dance sequences the likes of which haven't been seen since Busby Berkley.All in all it's a heady film that's worth seeing at least once. I missed it in the theatres, but bought the special collector's DVD when it hit the store shelves, and don't regret it one bit.If I had a nitpick, and I'm not sure that I do, it might be with some of the tunes chosen for the musical sequences. They're songs I was familiar with, and I think that lends the film a kind of youthful credibility, but or two original songs might've been welcome.Ewan MacGregor is dashing and Nicole Kidman is ravishing as always. They make a fine couple, and tug at our heart's sentiment.Definitely worth renting or owning.Enjoy.",Null,1,2,15 June 2009
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind
","I worked for the producer who imported many Japanese anime, and I'm not sure, but this may have been one of them. The Americanized version is shorter, has the usual poor dubbing, and truncates a lot of the nuances of the story's meanings that otherwise come through with the additional footage of the original film.I purchased a special edition DVD when it first came out. Wow. A massive box with lots of extras, and all for a movie. I didn't mind. I also purchased the Disney publication of the same film, and watch that disk as opposed to the disk that came with a scale model of one of the critters of the film, a pouch duplicating the princesses, and a few other do-dads that I can't recall right now. It wasn't cheap, but at the time I had the money.But, to the movie. It's excellent. Good stuff which shows Miyazaki's outlook on the natural order of things, and how there's no real evil in the world, just hurt souls waiting to be healed and rediscovered, or parties operating at odds with one another. That's his point of view, or POV as we say in the film bizz.The animation, like all Japanese animation, is somewhat stilted at times, and some of the perspective shots are a little exaggerated or stiff, but the story and overall film making remain strong. This is an early epic sci-fi anime film that shows a female heroine overcoming challenges with charm, wit and strength, forming a holy trinity of a dynamic soul that has the hearts and minds of all involved in a warmonger's quest to resurrect an awful truth from the past.As with all things Japanese there're subtle themes being played here. The visuals are delightful, and can either be watched with a family or enjoyed as a solo effort.Truly a great piece of anime, and truly a great film unto itself.

Event Horizon," Dumb
","What do you get when you put a bunch of marketers in a think tank, and give them the sole purpose of creating 'the next big thing...'? I'll tell you what you get; you get a bunch of teen-age boys who want to see blood, topless women, good 'drama' (as they define it), space-ships, and a little bit of horror and gun play, and in-your-face moments.This has got to be one of the absolute worst films I've seen in a long time. It's like an X-rated 'Mission to Mars,' but with a lot more needless gore, courtesy of the appetite of America's teenage-boy-market driven media-babysitter society.

AND, I'd bring it in on time, AND, it'd be interesting, AND it'd make a return, AND it'd bring a mainstream audience back to the threatre.To me it looks like some USC film major flunkie read the manual to the original DOOM computer game, and thought they'd could go the distance with a script based on a flimsy premise: Hell occupying another dimension.Lots of blood, f-words, and a pair of breasts, if I were Joe Bob Briggs I might recommend this crap, but as it turns out the best I can recommend is that you use the DVD as a coaster.Avoid like the plague.Better yet bang on Paramount's business doors, and demand your money back.An utter waste of time, money and effort... and that's just to watch the thing.",Null,1,2,24 February 2005
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Film Review
","Years ago a sound-man on a Sun Micro corporate video shoot gave me a phone number for a job contact up at ILM. Being a young sci-fi fan and a then aspiring film maker, I was a nervous wreck. I called the number, let it ring three times and then hung up, largely because I had very little technical training and didn't think I would be of much benefit.After seeing Disney's take on mister Lucas's creation, I think I can safely say that that was a good decision.This film is long. It's got tons of contemporary wit. Has several graphic novel (comic book) moments in it. And, most importantly, very much lacks the sense of wonder that everyone experienced back in the 70s and 80s with the first Star Wars' films--a thing that I think even the so-called prequels manage to keep in spite of suffering story shortcomings. Films are meant for social inspiration, and this film departs from the predominantly white cast of the first films, and is a bit more all inclusive. That's a plus. Yet it feels ham-fisted to me. As if it was an afterthought to include African-Americans, Asians, Middle Eastern people, and whoever else, in the character line up. Personally, I don't care. Make the whole cast of mixed parentage from African Pygmies, Native Americans, Amazon tribes and Finnish and Russian for all I care, as long as it's a good story, but if you think that the fan who may have racist feelings is going to be suddenly enlightened, then you have another thing coming. In short, the benefits of a cosmopolitan cast, to me, do not outweigh an extremely iffy plot.This film pays homage to The Empire Strikes back with several scenes that are lifted and yet re-arranged for this new movie's purpose (you'll note the space sequence and ground battle, reshuffled, as well as an 'homage' to the showdown between Luke and Vader from 'Empire'), but, unlike 'The Empire Strikes Back''s dramatic and operatic pacing and overall scale, we have a film that's driven by plot and subplot. Those of us who have seen and read the original Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers' serials, that would include mister George Lucas, there was larger edge to the story that made them grander than what they initially were; a relatively low budget series meant for boys and girls. 'The Last Jedi' tries to placate to the Star Wars' fan, but doesn't understand its own roots other than what was produced in 1977 and afterwards.An hour of this film could have been cut, and it's my personal opinion that the film was unnecessarily fluffed up or inflated for a distinct lack of good story material. 'Empire Strikes Back' moves because each scene is pertinent, and moves the story forward for both the larger struggle in which the characters are involved, and their own personal struggles as they relate to the cause. That's what made those films so good.The other real pitfall of this film is that we're never given a motive for the bad guys being bad guys. That is to say we don't know why they 'turned to the dark side', unlike the nebulous yet rather emotionally found reasons explained to us in both Empire and Jedi. There's none the such given here.There is one major positive about this film, and that is it reflects back on a message from the Hospitaller knight from Ridley Scott's 'Kingdom of Heaven', and that is what matters is right action. But this is never really underscored nor pushed as a central theme, even though this is the key element around which the movie revolves. Instead the film meanders from one audience pleasing moment to the next, and never becomes fully realized.I trained as a screenwriter, worked as a grip, stage manager, camera operator, and even just as a jack of all trades from the late 80s up through the mid 90s, a half hour south of ILM, wondering if I should have been really kicking myself for not taking that opportunity some three decades ago. Well, again, after seeing this film, I think it was the right decision. I can write a better movie. No joke. I can. Not that I would have ever had the chance to write a Star Wars' film, but to this end, and seeing this film in all its alleged glory, I'm glad I never worked on one. And, further, as much as I loved seeing Star Wars for the first time way back in 1977 on opening days, and subsequent re-screenings after that, I can truly say that this film epitomizes why I never became a fan in spite of being a dyed in the wool science fiction fan.Thanks for reading.",Null,2,3,28 January 2018
Brave," Bravehart, Disney Princess style.
","There was a lot of buildup for this film. A lot. And at the time I was sorry I missed the movie in the theatres. I expected a film about a female venturing into the male world of warriors.But, ah, no, it was not so. Instead I, like the rest of America (and the world I guess) saw a movie about a family Ursine oriented curse.Huh.You know, I just don't get what the heck goes through the heads of some of these Hollywood producers these days. Case in point, I saw that A-Team reunion sponsored by UK's Channel four, and one of the comments made by either one of the cast members or the producer was that TV (and movies I guess) today is all about female fantasy.Okay. Fine. The buyer for the household is a woman or female. But, ah, I think statistically the breadwinner is still the father, and he still takes his kids to movies. Half of which, ideally, are male. So, you as a father with a wife, daughter, and a son, are going to see a Disney family film. And it's another Disney Princess affair, only set in the cold rainy latitudes of Scotland. But it's still about a girl, her mother, and their issues. Are you going to see another Disney picture, knowing that's it's going to be about some female and her issues? Maybe. But I'm guessing probably not.Especially when said issues revolve around transmogrifying your parent into a creature of the wild. Oh sure, maybe there's some allegorical theme about familial relations or dysfunction in a family, but ... where's the dude stuff?You know, maybe I'm just not Disney viewer material anymore. Maybe Micky, Goofy, Pluto, Minnie, Donald and all the rest are just animal vestiges of what is now strictly a 'girl's world' when it comes to things Disney. Maybe I'm old, stodgy, and just plain old mean and nasty (as per some other poster's view on my opinion on illicit substances and abuse thereof). Maybe I'm just not with the times. Maybe I'm old fashioned and need to go buy a cabin in the woods and let society evolve. Ah ... NO!Look, PIXAR and Disney Studios, I actually don't mind films focused on women or the fairer sex in general. But when you crank out this garbage to the exclusion of all else, then you lose me and the rest of red-white and blue blooded American males.Brave was not interesting. Brave had no epic feel or qualities to it, unlike what was suggested in the promos. Brave focused on yet another mother-daughter relationship thing. Brave, for all of its Scottish medieval-ism, had absolutely nothing to do with Scotland during the middle ages. You might as well set this thing in 21st century Aspen ... at least according to FBI statistics most sociopaths gravitate towards there, so you might have a better story to work with.But as it stands now, this was a run in the mill CGI fest that would have made me feel very ripped off had I paid a full ticket price to see it, as opposed to checking out a beat-up copy from the local library FOR FREE.I grew up with Disney. I got the story records, I saw Herbie and Swiss Family Robinson and other films several times, visited Disneyland, bought some of the classic films on both VHS and DVD ... the whole nine yards.But as a male, regardless of my age, I'm feeling more and more alienated by a marketing model that has all but ditched my sex to see if girls of all ages will open up their wallets and purses to shell out cash for half baked schlock. And that includes TRON Legacy, by the way.Disney powers that be, go back, rework your script, and make a REAL movie about Scotland in the middle ages, but for the sake of sheer humanity, put some GUY STUFF in the damn thing.End of story.",Null,0,2,5 April 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy," Stupid and awful
","If you took an infinite number of 12 year olds, threw them into a room with an equal number of typewriters, this is the script they'd come up with.I can't believe anyone above pre-adolescence would praise this film on any level.A massive CGI b-film with acting and dialogue to match, this movie is as high-budget as they come, but delivers junk food cinema to the pre-teen and adult with pre-teen tastes who thinks the latest Marvel-Disney offering is Oscar material.No, the film was not too fast for me. Yes, I could follow the story in spite of the massive load of special effects. Yes, I knew who 'Thanos' was from the Marvel pantheon of bad guys. But, no, I did not think this was a good movie, and in fact thought it stunk to high heaven.The plot was idiotic. The subplot was marginally interesting. The world in which the characters in habit is never fully explained, and the 'Guardians' don't seem to have a lot of others of their species in this sci-fi setting.Not only that, but the whole 'destroy / conquer the universe' trope is just too stupid beyond belief. At some time you need to ask yourself why the bad guy is doing what they're doing. That's what makes them bad guys in the first place. When you don't have that, you don't have a movie.I can't believe I wasted my time on this trash heap. At least I checked it out at the library, and didn't waste one red cent on it.",1,3,11,21 July 2015
Caddyshack," another poor comedy that is remembered as a classic
","The 1980s saw some okay music, the advent of computers into the home was really taking off, and the science fiction genre (riding off the coat tails of Star Wars) was really making a comeback in feature films.But not everything from the 80s is golden, as I mentioned in some previous reviews. And Caddyshack is one of them.Simply put I don't get this film. I really don't. Bill Murry has a kind of Ahab-like obsession with a rodent chewing up his workplace home turf, and there's some thing about a gold contest and an examination of snobbery. Bill Murry acting like a drugged out gardener is not funny. It simply is not funny. I don't know why people (mostly men) heap praises on it, but it is not funny in the least. Or, rather it could be but you would have had to have shaved off several IQ points from your personal intelligence quotient.And I can't make it any plainer than that.This is one of those few rare occasions where the sequel is funnier, and given that this film is worthy of a smirk or two at best, that's not high praise.If you like idiotic humor, then maybe check out this film, but don't say I didn't warn you.Watch at your peril.",Null,5,11,20 June 2017
Clash of the Titans," Well.... I kinda liked it.
","Okay, look, for me this film is a vast technical improvement over the one starring Harry Hamlyn toting a clockwork owl. Now, having said that, I've got to admit that like Variety's Brian Lowrey, I too felt like I was watching a rehash of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings', only set in Ancient Greece with a few minor alterations here and there.Otherwise, I liked the film. Oh sure, the dialogue was canned, as was the dark feel of the film (a thing I didn't like), but it was entertaining. Truth be told the SFX did overshadow what could have been a better film, but the acting is what it is, solid, not really outstanding as this really isn't high drama (though it could have been).The action scenes and the brooding by the characters holds back a better film. But the story is solid. In fact, I'd say it's better executed than the original, which to me always felt like a Disney film gone bad.If I had another complaint, it would be that there's a lack of grittiness about this film. Everything seems to have a dark fantasy sheen painted over it. In fact, with all the twirling overhead shots, browns saturating the picture, and other Pete Jackson like trademarks, I wasn't sure if in fact I wasn't watching a film secretly directed by Peter Jackson himself!The original film was nothing to brag about. Okay, it took a classic myth and put it on screen, and did so with a kind of artistry that small boys (my friend included) enjoyed, but, beyond that, in spite of a solid cast (Olivier, Meredeith, et al) it didn't fly very well. This new iteration of the classic tale does a slightly better job.Things to improve upon; lighten up the colors and frame for Zeus' sake. Let us see the true color of the water. I mean this is supposed to be the Mediterranean, not the North Sea. Let us see how Greeks lived. Heck, you don't have to show us an olive press or winery, but show us more than just the Greek equivalent of Japanese citizens running from a mythological Kaiju. Art direction, other than what I just mentioned, is top notch, though one gets the sense that not all of the props were used to their fullest. That's more of a story fault, if anything, but, the story is what it is, and it's not that bad.I've got more to say, but I'll let it be for now. It's not the best film ever, but it's got some minor redeeming qualities.Take a chance, but don't pay extra to see it in 3D.",Null,2,4,4 April 2010
Black Hawk Down," Good dude flick.
","I've written some pretty lousy reviews of late, even on films I liked. I dunno... maybe I was feeling rotten, or it was that cold I've been trying to kick for the last week. Anyways, here's a film I'm good with. A good old fashioned shoot-em-up flick.A little history; Somalia was an independent kingdom until the European Age of colonialism. Prior to and during the second World War it was an Italian holding. The extreme racism that characterized fascist Europe did not penetrate deeply into Italian Somalia. As such you get some very mixed and interesting ancestries on the proverbial Horn of Africa.The Italians eventually left. And with them went any semblance of civilization. Tribal ties in that area of the world are the only political force recognized. Well, that and an AK47. So, when there's a drought and the crops and cattle die, who do you blame? Why, logically your neighbors and whatever multitude of tribal deities abound.So it is with Somalia, and so it is that the population has overburdened the ecosystem, which, without modern farming techniques, cannot sustain the population levels. When you mix that with an uneducated people you get a disaster brewing.'Black Hawk Down' shows one of the many episodes of military intervention that the United States has had to venture upon, and usually with mixed results. The episode regards the planned ambush and downing of a US Black Hawk helo, and the combat that ensued from that.Ridley Scott puts his masterful commercial-film-making style to the story , to create something that's actually worth looking at once, possibly twice. Shot in North Africa (Morocco I believe), Scott craftily reverses angles to make the North Western African coast appear to be its polar opposite.Cinematography is a must see in this. There's a lot of detail and mood manipulation via color extraction and enhancement from scene to scene. The acting is solid, though the drama seems somewhat overplayed. The story is told mostly from an accurate account written and transcribed from the meticulously researched book of the same name by Scott Bowden. Bowden actually went to Somalia to ask questions and look at the locations of the battle. A thing this writer would not do. Kudos to him.If I had a gripe with this film, it would be the story telling avenue that Ridley Scott took. And that is to meld a couple of the characters together to keep the story moving. It's not really his fault as such. It's a common enough device to more compactly transcribe some real world event onto the big screen. For me, I would've preferred the approach used in 'TORA TORA TORA'. Keeping things real, so to speak.So, why were we in Somalia? Initially to feed the population that was starved because of crop failure brought on by drought. The result of that was the creation of a 'Mad Max' like world where armed gangs roamed the streets, wielding power by stealing UN Food shipments. George Herbert Walker Bush ordered the military to go in and escort/guard the UN food shipments. Clinton came into office, and decides to try to solve the Somalia dilemma by pursuing a policy of 'nation building'. Hence our forces are beefed up, and we're suddenly trying to go after the various warlords. Aidid, the most powerful one, sees an opportunity to demonize the US so he can eventually reign over Somalia by generating support for himself. Things spiraled out of control from there.I actually remember the day this episode happened. And scratching my head as to what was going on down there. The media reported that an engagement had taken place, showed that horrible footage of the dead US soldiers (rangers?) being dragged through the streets, but then nothing more. And no one, and I mean absolutely no one, in the mainstream news audience got anymore information than that.Circa 1996 or 1995 Frontline did an investigation, and aired piece that ran one and one half hours on the disaster that was 'The Battle in Mogadishu'. Again, I was there when it premiered (though I may have the air date year wrong), and was very curious to learn the truth of what happened. Incredible.Some thing left out of Ridley Scotts film; there were two Apache gunships also involved in the fighting providing support, as well as a SEAL team who were with the holed up rangers and delta operators. All in all it's an extremely violent film, but one that's pretty true to the facts and spirit of what happened in Africa some 20 years ago. I can't watch it more than perhaps once a year. The special edition DVD has the Frontline piece I mentioned, though it's been trimmed down to an hour in length. The one comment that's been edited, but that I'll never forget, was a large bald serviceman smiling at the Frontline camera crew and shaking his head as he told them his thoughts during the firefight 'Nobody, not my friends, not my family, not my school teachers, knows what's happening to me right now.'",Null,0,1,30 November 2009
Singin' in the Rain," Possibly my favorite film
","This may or may not be my final user review. I don't really know as I type this. Every character my fingers hits, every key-stroke, brings to me a new realization of my thoughts' worth on film. In that vein, I hope that what I've written has served those who've read my reviews to better guide them to quality entertainment, and hopefully with new insight.But, to the film.'Singing in the Rain' has a special place in my heart. It's a window on an era of cinema that itself is another window on another era in cinema. We're seeing what the people of the 1950s thought of film some thirty to forty years before during its infancy.But, the real charm of the film is that we have a dancer who is masculine in his poetry. That, and he carries himself (to borrow from the film) with 'dignity'. This is another icon of male that a lot of men looked up to when the film was first released. Gene Kelley didn't ogle women, nor mistreat them. He showed gentle power through grace and poetry. A thing that today would be considered effete, or perhaps too high brow for the common man.But, even though we see Kelley giving us his smooth cultured delivery, we're also shown his comic side. He's a clown, but a smooth one. Even the most dignified have their comedic moments. He shows us guys how to court a cute young woman like Debbie Reynolds, and shows us that a woman of quality wants a man of quality. And quality doesn't come in the form of a fat bill fold, but the shedding of baser impulses, and embracing of the heart.Then we have Cosmo, the a-sexual friend whose relegated to the realm of emasculated dudeness. He's the class clown who never grew up. Does he date? We don't know. But then again, does it matter? He seems happy and content to play second string to Kelley's Lockwood character, but shines himself as he brings us the former Vaudevillian turned Hollywood supporting star.Then, there's Reynold's Kathy Selden character, who takes pot shots at the big boys from her humble station. She is elevated to professional performer status from her Catskills beginnings as a side show girl. She's beautiful and charming when she isn't being jealous of those who made it into 'the industry', and is taken under the wing of Kelley's smitten character.The plot thickens with Jean Haggen's Lina Lamont, the not-so-ditzy blonde with a nose for leverage. She may not know art, but she knows what she likes. And she likes getting the lime light, and it doesn't matter whose talent she has to exploit to get that light shining on her instead of those making her the starlet she's been made into.There's the head of the studio, the high energy director, various supporting roles, and, of course, the musical numbers. Call me nuts, but I like a good musical. To me there's something reassuring about men and women being able to show their physical prowess to the creative notes conjured by a musical mind. To me that's the peak of expressionism. Why musicals have been unfairly attached to fringe and counter culture is beyond me. Sure, they're old and corny, but why attach a feminist quality to those characteristics?The great thing about 'Singing in the Rain' is that it's a musical comedy that formulaic, doesn't take itself very seriously, but is smashingly successful. The guy gets the girl in the end, and isn't that what it's all about?'Singing in the Rain' is good old fashioned Hollywood film. It truly is, in every sense of the word. It was done in the days before CGI and green/blue-screen techniques, has its own brand of SFX, has a lot of dazzling production numbers (again, to wow the audience in the days before model spaceships and CGI), and somehow manages to focus all of that on the haphazard and somewhat rocky (yet still sweet) flavored courtship between a man who wants to be a talented star, but isn't, and a woman who should, but is held back. The two eventually meet, and romantic magic is conjured.And I guess that's why it's my favorite film. It has all the gags and good musical numbers from days of old, but it also tells a tale of the way love ought to turn out. The way it ought to be. And, in spite of all the Hollywood gloss, glitz and glamor, it stays focused on that single message.There's of course Gene's famous dance number, which, truth be told, should resound with every red blooded male who's ever fallen for that one special lady. It should also give us guys hope that that special lady is out there, just waiting to inspire us so that we too can go splashing, and Singing, in, the Rain.I loved films from my days as a boy. This film was, and still is, one of my inspirations for life. If I were to go back into the film industry, hopefully, if allowed, I would be able to go back in time and visit the MGM lot during its musical hey-day, and help create magnificent films like the one I just reviewed. Something with a lot of humor, pizazz, little violence, and gentle story about a man and a woman meeting one another. I think I've always felt that... in fact I'm pretty sure I always have.With that, I'm going to end my series of reviews here for now. Thanks all, but they just don't make 'em like this anymore.",10,1,2,5 October 2009
Avatar," Not my cup of tea.
","So, I'm a big sci-fi and action type of guy with epic exposition in mind. So why did I not take a shining to this film that had all those elements and more? Why did I not warm up to it? What was it that was missing from this piece?It's kind of the same reason I didn't go see 'ID4', and why I thought that concept of a film was pretty bad in the first place. It had no soul.So it is with Bruce Cameron's 'Avatar', a play on the realm of computer games and online interaction, which tells the tale of a man who is likewise relegated to forever living vicariously through his blue skinned alternate persona. A comment on today's youth if I ever saw and heard one before in my life.'Avatar' hits all the right dramatic cues. It hits all the right emotional chords for drama, plot, character, story, and even has dazzling visuals to accompany the tale of a world fraught with noble savages warring with a corporate army.I found myself laughing, loving, and even shedding tear or two as I watched this film in a packed movie theatre. And with all of the explosive action, with all of the romance and traditional underdog fighting hightech warrior themes going on, what was it that this film lacked?For all of the pro-native and pro-life messages going on here, I just found the thing to be fairly plain and unintelligent. The message of the film is sent via a telegram. It's written in big letters and nearly shoved down the throat of the audience with a huge silver spoon. Couple that with the 'muster your inner soul' thing, and I had a hard time connecting with this film on a basic level.Oh sure, I got all the emotional stuff, and agreed with the moments of drama, but it simply was a film made for a five year old teenager. In short, it was unintelligent. When I think of classic sci-fi that I watched ages ago, I think of films that were made for adults even though they were veiled in high gloss that attracted younger viewers. That, and they had a set of precepts of what was right, and what was wrong. It wasn't a clinical analysis and twisting of basic and fundamental American values, and breakage thereof.But 'Avatar' is made for the young 'international' youth audience. It's designed to be a universal message attempting to appeal to everyone and everything. It's like a politician who promises a chicken in every pot, who kisses babies, shakes hands and the like, but winds up being powerless because he's promised too much to everyone, and has lost his own sense of worth. That sounds very existential, but it's essentially the problem with 'Avatar'. And it's essentially part of the reason it is not thriving like the other established sci-fi franchises out on the market. 'Avatar's' message is that your primal instinct to mate should outweigh your other responsibilities, and that those other values that are wrapped in a colored cloth are mere jingoism and are merely clouding your judgment. The nail in the message's coffin is the corporate army is just that, a business venture run for mass murder, and for the sake of controlling and educating the natives. It's a trite message for a film that demonstrates equal regard for its target audience. And as for the 3D adding to the film? I saw the same technology demonstrated at Disneyland 25 years before with Captain EO. I can't say much has improved.Watch at your own risk.",Null,3,5,13 August 2011
The Artist," Genius
","I'm getting tired of reviewing other peoples' work, when I want to be shooting my own stuff, but this film really was a stroke of genius.Who says they don't make black and white silent films anymore? Before the days of talkies, musicals (much less sci-fi blockbusters and CGI fests) there were the likes of Rudolph Valentino, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplain and a host of others who are now immortalized in American (and now global) cinematic culture.Old fashioned film making with modern film making techniques, and a few rifts on an old formula with a contemporary twist. Me, I really didn't get the whole romance thing, but that's just me. It seemed a bit over the top. But, the film is what it is.Give it a shot. It's worth a view, though I might only recommend it to die hard film aficionados.Enjoy.",Null,11,18,14 January 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," 'Stanley Kubrick made one film too many...'
","Sayeth the sandwich maker who worked at the corner deli run by Koreans. And you know what? Dude was right.I don't get affairs. Nor ritualized sex. And apparently neither did Kubrick when he made this film. To me this film is one made by a man who had too much cinematic power, and was probably trying to stay on top of the burgeoning 'adult video' market that was becoming more accessible to mainstream America by virtue of net commerce.It's well shot, of that there is no doubt. Technical marks all hit their cues, and are right on target. But the story itself? Wow. Pretty vapid stuff if you ask me.I think the problem here is that the question of why do people have affairs is pretty straight forward. People have sexual interests in one another, and sometimes if they're married they're willing to take their chances on breaking a legal bond with their spouse. There's not much more to it than that. It's part of why women put men through so many test during courtship.I think Kubrick, and perhaps a good portion of cuckolds or non-sexually active society are tantalized and interested in sex, so this movie was made.Me, I haven't laughed so hard at certain points in the film since 'Used Cars'. I just truly think this is a ridiculous film on a number of levels, and it's not something I would ever make nor watch again. A couple that has fallen off the beaten track either has an abusive situation going on, or one of them lacks character. Again, it's pretty simple stuff. No film can really capture the 'magic' of an affair, because affairs aren't magical to begin with. They're acts of betrayal. Like I said, it's not a film I'll ever see again, nor would I like to work on this kind of project (paycheque depending). Hell, if I were forced to shoot something like this, I'd end it with a bunch of special forces men rappelling down from helicopters during the orgy scene and raiding the place. Just me *insert smile here*.Not everyone can have a really good looking spouse, nor have steamy conjugal relations on a regular basis. So the urge is repressed, and when someone mentions the idea to another person, these stupid, cult like, 'religious' swingers societies develop. And I imagine people get hurt. I don't really know as I've no experience in that matter.But, Kubrick wants us to look at his version of a couple 'gone swinging'; one that has sexual exploration in mind. To me it's more of a comedy than anything else. I used to love seeing a Kubirck film because of his static yet compelling cinematography. The shots and assemblage of images from a former photo-journalist are supreme in execution. And yet, even so, even though Stanley Kubrick has been elevated to legendary status among industry and cine-files alike, he was, after all, only mortal. As is evident by this film.Skip this one. If you need to see sex on the screen, then hit one of the adult websites of your choice.Watch at your own risk.p.s. you don't betray the one you love. Ever.p.p.s. the other theme here is keeping interest in the one you love. Don't lose interest.*EDIT* Final edit here; the thrust of this film was to get the husband to rekindle interest in his wife. Her concern may have been since he lost interest in other women by actively suppressing his desire, he thus lost interest in her. It became her objective to reinvigorate his desire for her. Kubrick tried to make a noire 'adult film', but, and maybe it's because I'm not married, I just couldn't connect with it. Still, it was well shot. See it for that alone.",2,4,12,9 February 2012
Castle in the Sky," Good adventure film for all ages.
","I saw this when it first hit the home video market, and was enamored with the scope and scale of Miyazaki's imagination. Like a lot of good Japanese animation (anime) this one doesn't stick with giant robots or sadistic antagonists, or other familiar tropes that pervade anime and science fiction in general. Having said that there is a military bent or element placed in the film. As with some other Miyazaki offerings the military is seen as a tool that is often misguided or misused for other people's schemes. So it is that Paizu, the main character, and Sheeta, the damsel in distress with a family secret, are challenged by the local authorities as they seek to discover her origins and the source of intrigue regarding her past. The film is an anime epic, long in scope and vast in imagination, and filled with both action and adventure as well as more reflective moments. And when I said this was a good adventure film for all ages, I meant it. Where there is some military violence, there's no blood shed, and the sexual intrigue is kept G-rated, PG at worst (and in a very Japanese cultural vein), unlike a lot of science fiction offerings from Japanese animation usually aimed at teenage boys and older. Families can watch this, though very young viewers may get apprehensive or questioning at some of the action.'Castle in the Sky' is a riff on a story element from Jonathan Swift's 'Gulliver's Travels' regarding a flying city, hence the title of the film. Though unlike Swift's tale this story doesn't take place in the 18th century, but in the Victorian era with what is often referred to as a 'steampunk' setting.As with a lot of Japanese 'anime' offerings, the animation, though vast in scope and impressive in the tale it brings, it's not Disney. That is to say the animation is somewhat stilted, though a bit smoother than a lot of anime of the time. Even so it is still a pleasure to watch, though older children might get a little impatient with it.A great Myazaki offering. Watch it on a lazy weekend afternoon, or perhaps when there's nothing else on during the week. Either way, enjoy.",Null,3,3,11 June 2017
Die Hard," Space Nazis! (3)
","A decent actioner that came in the late 80's, 'Die Hard' shows an 'ex cop' slugging it out with terrorists who, for some strange reason or another, make all appearances of being German, or rather a conglomerate of ethnically white Europeans, possibly a mix of Eastern Europe, but most certainly from some radical group, like the Nazi party. Ho hum. Maybe Hollywood can indoctrinate a new set of bad guys at some point in the future.The film itself is well executed, pretty campy here and there with lots of stunning pyrotechnics and plenty of gunfights and overall action. The acting isn't even half bad, or rather appropriate for the moments that appear in the film; high energy in some places, campy in others, comic book like in some other areas. You can't take it seriously on any level really. Enjoy it for what it is. Mindless action. Not a film I would put in my DVD collection, but not something I would shirk at seeing again either.",Null,1,1,25 May 2013
To Kill a Mockingbird," High drama.
","I saw this in a drama class, and learned a great deal about story structure and theme, as well as performance presentation. But, beyond all the technical tidbits we were supposed to pick up, it was a compelling story about another time and another place.I was raised in a very egalitarian household and environment. I would hear high ranking bureaucrats comment on societies ills, and what social problems were ailing what populations. Things like blight, social strife, racism, inequality among the sexes, were all ailments of society. 'To Kill a Mockingbird' shows us some of those facets in the deep south circa late 40s, early 50s. We see populations not so much at odds with one another, but desiring to keep a certain degree of conformity. And amidst this is a paragon of principle, Atticus Finch. A lawyer from the old school of taking a public trust to defend those in need, like a social knight, a paladin with the soul of mankind as his coat of arms emblazoned on his shield.But no sword or shield can protect all from the anger that boils under those who have nothing but one thing in common with 'their betters' (to borrow from the language of the time; e.g. their skin color. And so an old twisted and perverted social code mislabeled and sham-ably so as 'southern chivalry', is code for disliking another human being for superficial traits.Atticus bears the soul of the town, and acts as a stop gap to mayhem when he can, trying to shine light on the mid 1900s US equivalent of the European Dark Ages; ignorance and fear residing in all but the most stalwart of hearts. We have Atticuk's children; Scout and Jem, representing the newer and younger generation who are the offspring of this paladin. They are the innocents who see the injustices and see their father do battle with those whose social morays are skewed to privilege. To them it's an adventure. To their father, it is a struggle; a battle against a kind of scaly serpent that knows only survival.To the maid and townsfolk, it is a battle royale, referencing the imagery I just stated. What will rule? The unspoken law, one that no one dares codify in any book, or the principle that which the written law was designed and engineered to uphold, like a charger bearing a man at arms. They are divided. The meek understand the power of the strong, and rely on the social contract founded by the framers of the nation some two-hundred years before. It is a simpler time for simpler ideas. Called 'the old South' people are mostly civil to one another. Race is not a factor until conflict rears its head, then lines are drawn, and factions are segmented. But not everyone is so sided in such a schism. There are simple folk who care for others. There are opportunists who seek to operate within the rules of law, but seek their own goal, as per William Windom (known to me as Commodore Decker from the Doomsday Machine episode from Star Trek). We have the man suffering from addiction who holds the biggest secret of them all. And the innocent on both sides of the social divide who are recruited by their own weakness to resist being dragged into a fight that's not theirs.We have a mixture of simple and meager with the wise and relatively affluent. We see the social mingle of various people, and how that is challenged by base instinct. That's what this film is all about.It's high drama. Can we as a species not embrace our warmth for other living creatures and men, or does our inner reptile gnaw at our desires so much to the point of overcoming higher reasoning? And how will the next generation be impressed b this? And for all those high minded notions, how can a simple minded human show us what we truly value?Okay, all of that is pretty heady stuff, but those are the themes that energize and thusly force the story to glow. We're seeing a slice of life of the old south; good and bad. It's a microcosm of America; good and bad; ugly and beautiful all at once. It's a part of America that we don't see a great deal of because there's a kind of shameful beauty there. It's one that's actually universal, but has a unique American flavor to it.Finally, the film is mostly of all simply about memories. Technical notes; the camera work is classic here. The opening sequence is something right out of a 70s or 80s sequence. A confluence of shots that was ahead of its time. The dolly and crane shots are also basic, as are most of the setups. And the sound does not dominate the image. Everything is as like a well balanced Japanese rice paper painting. A kind of basic structure with great composition.A good film.Enjoy.",Null,0,1,14 April 2012
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Utter trash.
","My uncle lived through the Bataan march, and was a POW in a Japanese labor camp. According to his daughter the one comment he made about this movie was as follows; '*Explicative*, we never had it that good!'He then reportedly stormed out of the TV room.You know, I have to say that I saw this film a couple times as a kid, and I never thought much of it. Initially I was going to title my review 'Egomania 3' because that's kind of what we have here. The 'drama' between the leads is manufactured in the extreme. The squaring off between Guiness and Mifune puts a grim smirk (if you could call it that) on this viewer's face.The film just doesn't ring true as to what happened to American, British, Australian, New Zealander and even French or Dutch POWs taken by the Japanese. The Imperial Japanese military didn't have the wanton industrial slaughter mechanism of the Nazi regime in Europe, but instead had the 'work them until they're dead' ethic derived partially from Bushido, the code of the samurai. The acting was over the top. The story was so detached from reality as to be insulting, and by that I don't just mean my family's anecdote, but the interviews with survivors who went through that atrocity tell a very different and tragic story. During the Bataan march itself Japanese soldiers routinely shot anyone who looked weak or didn't look like they could make it, or rested. Then, once they got to the camps, it was hell baking in corrugated iron huts, laboring in hot and disease infested regions. And that's just for starters; the treatment, the food, the sheer and utter abuse; NONE of that is in this film.This film is about Hollywood parading its stars for what some idiot asinine producer thought would be a good patriotic film showing Americans and British being defiant in the face of the odds.Wrong.Look, I love Japanese culture. I love the food, I love the movies, I love the clean and polite society, and the people themselves, and I certainly don't hold any grudges whatsoever. In fact I want to retire there. And, I'm not the only one. Therefore, why not make a movie that shows the REAL EXPERIENCE? I can't answer that, but what I do know is that this piece of cinematic trash is just another notch in a southern Californian metroplex film industry that seems to never get anything right when it comes to history.What's even more insulting is that people have voted it so high as a quality film. Between the Russians not getting credit for their massive effort in what they call 'the Great Patriotic War' and people like my family who were there when it happened, it's a wonder the entire film industry hasn't been run out of town and forced to setup shop in Mexico.Respectably shot, egotistical acting, poor SFX (notably the miniature), and a script that is just so idiotic I can't believe anyone green-lit this thing, it's a film that's definitely got some massive flaws.If you need to see a WW2 film about the Pacific Theatre, then check out Tora Tora Tora (Tiger Tiger Tiger).See this movie once, then do your brain a favor and pick up a book on the subject to learn what REALLY happened.",1,10,23,31 August 2013
The Green Mile," No miracle this.
","I heard the hype regarding this film over the years, and when on vacation I was almost bombarded by its presence on TNT Turner Classics. To be honest, I'd never thought much about it, but had heard about Tom Hanks and Michael Duncan being in the film, and how profound and moving the film was.Well, I finally saw it, and I can't say that I was all that taken with it. A key plot point in the opening sequence is never addressed, and in turn what we're left with is a supernatural unresolved story, leaving this audience member scratching his head.The film revolves around a condemned man and his restitution to the public, if it could ever be characterized as that. We are made privy to the operations of condemned men in the South, and those who keep watch over them. As I sat there and watched the film, and as entertaining as I found if, I was still curious as to how the situation, the characters and audience find themselves in, came to being. But, as I say, it is never addressed by the film.Therefore the film is a kind of ambiguous setup and story, which is designed to leave you with a sense of wonder via your own imagination. And I guess that's why I found it entertaining, but dissatisfying all at once. It's not a film I'll ever wantonly see again.Technical points; it's a first class production. There are no faults here in execution. This is A-quality commercial film making at its finest. The one fault that prevents me from liking the film is the writing. The whole premise and setup upon which this film is based is left blank. And, if this is not addressed nor otherwise explained, then how on earth can the rest of the film hold together? Simply put, the writer asks you to believe in the supernatural based on the opening scenes and the fate of the main characters. But, even if we're asked to believe in things that cannot be proved, the whole setup, a real situation, is never addressed to begin with. And, if this is so, then how can we invest ourselves in the rest of the story? Again, the fault of the author.All in all an interesting film, but not one that really held my interest in any regard (I was forced to watch the thing three times while on vacation). If you're of the religious mindset, then you might find this film entertaining. Even if you're not it is worth seeing once for the film itself. Give it a try.",Null,1,3,2 December 2012
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," I finally saw it.
","I can't say that I was anticipating this film a whole lot. After the first two films I felt this third installment was in that same vein in terms of level of entertainment. I don't know why, but this movie didn't capture my imagination like the fantasy films I grew up with which were by far more primitive in the technical department, but seemed to have a bit more heart than Jackon's take on Tolkien's Hobbit tale.This movie opens with the battle between Smaug and the people of Laketown. To me it was somewhat anticlimactic, but I understand why it was put in the opening of this film, and not as the climax at the end of the second film, but it still feels like a bit of an odd fit.The movie focuses on the climactic battle at the end of 'The Hobbit', and it's done a-la Peter Jackson; lots of action twists and drama.And I guess that's my only real complaint about Jackson's films (including the Rings movies), and that is that they do seem to be a bit over dramatic, full of angst and pathos where perhaps there wasn't any in the original tale. And I guess that's why that in the end, even though I can accept and enjoy the films for what they are, I really didn't connect with them as such, and still have a kind of detached like for them.Hey look, I won't come down on the films. I think they're okay. I do think they're a bit over dynamic, overwrought in the drama department, but good technical explorations of how far a good competent director can take a beloved myth cinematic-ally.However, when all is said and done, I think I still prefer the primitive Rankin-Bass animated special that aired all those decades ago (now on DVD). For some reason there's a bit more magic in that version than I found in these films.The Battle of Five Armies, again just my personal opinion, seemed a bit over the top in the action department, but that's Jackson's style. There wasn't much in the way of explaining how and why some of the powers got to be where they are, and it did seem very much like the people of Dale / Laketown were under-represented, and given a rag- tag fugitive look than what came across in the book.All in all these are competent movies, but I think they're made for a myth savvy younger generation, and perhaps not quite for kids or adults who would have also liked to have enjoyed the tale on a more basic level.Enjoy or watch at your own risk as you see fit.",Null,1,3,14 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A troubled film.
","I'm sorry, but I just don't know what else to say about this film. This is truly a piece of cinema that is struggling to entertain. With some of the most impressive visuals seen in the last 100 years of filmmaking, one wonders what went amiss here.The opening sequence of the two jedi pilots flying through the battle looks and feels odd, and sets the tone for the overall story. Many complain about the juvenile aspect of 'The Phantom Menace', and some of the kitschy story telling of the second film; 'Attack of the Clones'. But for me this film tops them all in terms of getting sidetracked by the visuals.For a film that's supposed to be rated-R it sure does seem to lean towards a kiddy audience in a very bizarre way. So much that I'm hard pressed to label this thing other than a skittish film that bounces from here to there in terms of at whom the story particulars were aimed.The best way to critique this film is to look at the first Star Wars film ever made. That movie was a bit of an homage to the old sci-fi serials, just like the Indiana Jones were an homage to the serial adventure series. But the thing about the original Star Wars film was that there was a grounding there, a sense of plausibility and realism that melded with the far off setting and adventure. When Leia was about to be interrogated in the Death Star, we knew she was in for a round of torture and horror. We never saw it, but it was very much implied. When Luke was looking out at the twin G1 and G2 stars of Tatooine, we saw a sunset shot as a real sunset, framed and pictured for us by Carole Ballards magnificent lensing; cinematography that gave a bit of a documentary feel combined with a classic film making framing reminiscent of films like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Ben Hur' or even 'Shane'. We were slowly introduced into that environment after having a taste of action in the beginning. And that's the other case for the original Star Wars film; example; the opening fire fight shows us a sense of reality, a sense of danger, a sense of plausibility and tension without an emphasis on showing off the visuals, or getting side tracked by truly unimportant SFX. The story dictated the shots, not the reverse.With 'Revenge of the Sith', and looking at the silly light saber fights, the puzzling antics detracting from the story direction (cutesy but dangerous miniature robots instead of an explosive warhead on a missile? Exactly who is this film for?), implausible feats even by super hero standards, simply put, torpedo this thing to the bottom of the interstellar equivalent of Davy Joneses locker.I saw it twice in the theatre. Once by myself, then again with some people I knew at the time. And I just couldn't get over the complete comic book abandon this film took to tell the story. It's like if someone were to make a prequel to 'Spartacus', and ditched all of the scope and profound character driven moments, and instead replaced them with cool martial arts action and flying weapons to take sword and sandal epics 'in a new direction'.And for all of the spectacular visuals the one thing that really gets me, that really makes me wonder, is that none, and I mean positively none of the special effects looked real. Visually spectacular, and technical wizardry beyond my SFX background, of that there is no doubt. But for all that, they looked like glamorized photo-realistic cartoons.That is key.The whole point behind the first film was to bring those exciting moments of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon to the big screen in an updated and more technically and dramatically driven vein. Every sci-fi fan loved the effort, me included. But these latest films? And specifically the last one? Wow, what a disappointment.But, they're the author's films, and what are we going to do about it? That's the vision he chose, and that's what we have.Hopefully the next big sci-fi film maker will throw something up on the screen with a bit more care, and perhaps be a bit more hands on in the art department and cinematography.For something as big and well known as Star Wars, there's a certain weight that the films needed to live up to. But the story is more fairy tale than the other films ever were, and fused with some outlandish and unconvincing special effects and action that really take over the film, one is very hard pressed to gleam anything positive out of this.I'll be brutally honest here, I think of my own film career and the opportunity I had to work up there in Marin (LF, ILM, Sp), and am glad I didn't. As a grip, PA or AD I wouldn't have had one iota in terms of creative input, and to be honest with myself my review is all hindsight, so I'm not even sure I would have had the wherewithal nor courage to point out some of the really obvious foibles in this piece. I mean, I'm not the director, and every director I used to work for had their view on how right their vision was; i.e. infallible. Is the author of Star Wars any different? I don't know.Watch at your own risk.",Null,6,9,31 October 2010
Bring It On," I've had cheer-sex.
","And it was great. The young ladies in question shall remain anonymous, but some innocent flirting with the popular cute girls always made my heart race a little, and put a smile on my face. Ah, memories.But, to the film. I didn't see this in the theatre. In fact, I had no idea the film had even hit the market until I saw the DVD. The store I was at had the DVD stocked on end caps, in the musical section, in the dance section, in the comedy section, and even as an impulse item. I mean, you couldn't avoid the thing! Everywhere I looked I saw this DVD stocked on the shelves.What was this movie? What was it about? I picked up a copy, and looked at the back; 'Staring a bunch of actors I've never heard of.' Okay, I thought before I scrunched my lips, 'I'll take a chance on it...' and then tossed a copy in the shopping cart.I fired it up, and was delighted to see a film about a time we all went through when youth of both sexes were discovering one another. We have the bookish (yet attractive) young man finding a connection with a girl who thinks he's cute. He doesn't understand her world too much, but finds himself drawn into her social graces, and, like a complete jerk and moronic idiot that he is, trashes the opportunity of a lifetime. Unlike a similar story I know of that took place in real life, this guy gets a second chance. Will he succeed? You have to see the film to find out.Meanwhile we have some side stories of cheerleaders vying for power on the squad, other cheerleaders attempting to get into colleges after graduation, and, of course, the politics of inter-racial relations as privileged white girls unknowingly partake in theft of the under-dogs living on the wrong side of the tracks. There's also the rebellious and principled new girl, who brings raw energy and attitude to help shape the squad, all the while at the same time she herself is shown another side of life, and comes to appreciate her fellow cheerleaders.In terms of the story structure and plot layout, it's formulaic, but the imagery and story telling mask that architecture, and deliver a film that, in spite of being extracted from and made for high school social elites (the popular 'cliques'), is really meant to be enjoyed by everyone. Include me in that number, and, I have to admit right now, I thought it was a heartwarming tale.Roger Ebert makes the comment that by including R-rated language and situations that the youth are at peril of losing their morality by virtue of watching this thing. Give me a break. What high school kid doesn't swear? Oh sure, some do it more than others, and they all talk about sex to some degree, so, for me at least (minus some of the more implicit sex scenes which we probably could've done without) this film is right on the mark in terms of that social milieu that we all went through. In short, watch it and enjoy it for what it is, though in all fairness to mister Ebert toning down the sex stuff might have made for a more universally accepting film (one that might've even won some awards).I know of no girl that didn't want to be a cheerleader, nor any guy that didn't want to date one or be close to one. Admittedly I was a little too concerned with high-minded ideals at the time to pay attention to any of the social trappings, but, having flirted with cheerleaders, I can say that they are one of a kind, and this film appropriately pays homage to them.Technically it's fine film. Lensing is appropriate, and lighting is bright to fill in shadows and show us the glowing tale that 'Bring it On' is. The choreography well shot, and overall staging is professional. Casting is on the money, and as this was my first Kirsten Dunst film, all I can say is she's one of the funnier actresses I've ever seen. The scripting was also excellent, even though the plot took liberties with the realities of cheerleading competition. All in all an excellent high-school genre film.Watch and enjoy.",Null,0,1,24 October 2011
Centurion," Way too bloody.
","For me the blood and gore over shadows the rest of the film. I simply had a hard time watching this thing with all the squib work and excessive gore and blood splatters.Well shot, there was some cliché acting and story telling involved. The story itself seems to be recycled material from King Arthur with lots of blood, which to me says that the target demographic was probably misread to cater to a more bloodthirsty audience, which probably wasn't all that blood thirsty in the first place, but perhaps more interested in seeing 'realistic action'. Blood gushing from bodies is not realistic.I'm sorry to say that for all the high production values that went into this film the realism gets tossed out the window, and is replaced with pornographic blood letting. Regrettable, but there it is. It seems like five minutes don't go by without someone getting hacked up and spilling a gallon of blood. Is that real? No.The acting is a bit melodramatic, but fits with pacing and overall film. Even so I'd be hard put to call it likable.I guess the best way to sum up this film is that it will appeal to those who have a thirst for grotesque hack-and-slash violence, but not much more. There's nary a love story, little of the politics of the time, little true realism (even little grittiness, as everyone seems very clean, save when they fight), but the film does deliver on incredibly high production values. Watching the deleted scenes one wonders why the first scene in the collection wasn't added (in spite of the director's commentary), because the film needed a few contemplative moments.If you want a true Roman sword and sandal epic, then look elsewhere, though if you're a die hard fan of the genre, then you may want to add this to your collection (which I may begrudgingly do... but more likely not).Not really a film I would recommend.Definitely watch at your own risk.",Null,1,4,5 December 2010
Blade Runner," Visually stunning.
","I have to agree with the great Roger Ebert; this film is visually stunning. It's a pleasure to look at the amount of art and detail that went into this film, but the inner story, the real heart and substance of this work of art, is a little thin.Don't get me wrong, I like the film. I really do. I think it's one of the finer pieces of cinema, but, I don't hold it in as high a reverence as I used to ages ago as young impressionable sci-fi fan. Ridley Scott came out of the school of shooting commercials, and applies his style to a cross-genre of science fiction and film noir. We have a film that wants to be intriguing: One that wants to show us the struggle between man and his creations. But it's just not as powerful as it could have potentially been.I happen to be a big Ridley Scott fan. I think his films are exceptional. 'Blade Runner' is no exception, but this film needs more umph to make it a real memorable picture in the vein of 'The Maltese Falcon'. What makes classic film noire memorable isn't the gun play or other violence, nor some of the incredible black and white photography and shadow play created by John Huston, but the characters and their dynamic.We actually have a bit of that in 'Blade Runner' (in fact the whole film revolves around this), yet it's never fully realized. Instead what we have is a visually attractive picture telling what amounts to little more than a 'monster movie'. The monsters can talk and act like humans, but they're monsters all the same. In this sense there's little between this and Scott's other previous effort; 'Alien'.If you'r a die-hard sci-fi fan who loves this movie, and you've gotten this far in my comment, then you're probably shaking your head. It's okay. I understand. I was enthralled wit the visuals when I was younger (and am still impressed with them), but you have to understand what this film tells us about ourselves to really come to a clear minded conclusion about the quality of the story.Like I said, it's a very good looking film. Yet even here some of the art direction, particularly for the technology, is a bit over stated. Note Deckard's voice manipulation of a device that scans and manipulates a photo, or the controls and general human interface for the flying cars. Even so, those are things are needed to get the 'futuristic' feel of the film across to the audience.It's a fine film, quite good in many areas, but not exceptional in all departments. Still, I like the film, and think it a piece of noteworthy sci-fi.",Null,0,3,16 December 2007
Ben-Hur," Better than 'Cleopatra'.
","I've rarely seen this film, but when I have, I've always enjoyed it. Not as a religious parable, as I am not religious whatsoever, but more of a story of triumph through strength, resilience, and perseverance. 'Cleopatra' had none of those elements going for it; just a couple of spoiled rich kids frolicking on the screen at the expense of broken hearts and egos of those involved. I truly do like this film better than 'Cleopatra', but then again I like 'Spartacus' better than either of these films.'Ben Hur' tells the tail of a rich noble from outside the Roman social elite who is fallen victim to his friend's own stalworthiness to the adherence of Roman law. The initial tale was a novel with religious overtones, upon which Hollywood picked up on (specifically Warner Brothers, and I think RKO before that for the silent version ... someone correct me there), produced and marketed to the movie going audience. It was a hit.A bigger hit, and continues to be a classic today (again, moreso than the Burton-Taylor escapade) for the reason that we witness a man fall from grace to rebuild himself once more. And, once there, to triumph like never before.Older viewers will like this film for its placation to ancient and modern mythologies. Regular film aficionados will like it for its scope, production values, and place in cinema history. That, and simply put, even though Cleopatra had the marvel of spectacle going for it (the sail barge, the magnificent entourage as Taylor first entered Rome, and so forth), Ben Hur is a better film for it reliance on basic cinematic principles. There is no less spectacle here to be sure, but the presentation of characters and setting are far more grounded and connect with the audience than ever could be done in 'Cleopatra'.The shortcoming, regrettably, are again the special effects, and specifically the naval miniatures. I mean, it is 1959 after all, but still, surely something could have been done, particularly given that the silent film spare no expense in building a Roman fleet to clash with pirates of the Mediterranean. Other than that, even the dark interior scenes, are superbly lit for the time.There's lots to say about 'Ben Hur', but, simply put, other than 'Spartacus', it is the superior sword-and-sandal epic.Younger viewers will get impatient with its pacing, but older viewers will like it all the same.Definitely give it a whirl on the DVD player.p.s. regarding the Krishna (Christian) mythology; the story works without it, but it's there regardless. You religious types will pour over it, but it really is unnecessary, and again, it's a bastardization of imported Indian philosophy to the Roman Empire.",Null,2,5,26 February 2012
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen's heart.
","I'm not going to add much more to what's already been written. Yes, it is a somewhat tedious film in terms of style, but, like another reviewer commented, it is fairly solid in terms of Allen's later work.What we have here is some pretty pointed commentary on an age old dilemma, and its manifestation in modern times. We are witness to the temptation of the mad-handsome-artistic-genius to two young woman who are ostensibly social opposites. Both escape, but not before succumbing to this man's charms and false promises.Ultimately does it really matter what a person's past is? It should, but is not always pertinent. As many an investment broker and banker has stated 'Past performance is no guarantee of future results.' Again, ultimately it is the human need, the human heart, that wins out in the end. And isn't that what really matters? The tawdriness was a weakness, and perhaps would've been best avoided. We see the weakness of the characters as they ignore all the warning signs, and go through the motions of ill fated decisions. Fortunately it all works out in the end.Production values; standard Wood Allen fare, I think I miss him narrating the film, and would've appreciated him as a minor character... maybe an art instructor who witnesses the whole thing first hand.Regardless, I found the film entertaining, though hard to digest in one sitting. Yes, I too subscribe to his 'earlier funnier ones' theory, but appreciate the art he's created in his later years.",Null,2,5,2 July 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Ambitious period film.
","I hadn't heard too much about this film, but had seen the posters for it, so I gave it a shot. And after leaving the theatre I really wasn't sure what to say about it.There's a lot of good stuff in this film, but there're some pitfalls as well. On the plus side the sets and costumes are magnificent. A great deal of care and love when into the art direction to bring us an Elizabethan renaissance film, replete with court intrigue and foreign emissaries who threaten invasion because of high seas thievery courtesy Clive Owen's character. Visually this film is very lush and impressive, though somewhat confining at times. We're never really shown Elizabethan England, just the 'important parts' that are salient to the story.And, as Elizabeth's favorite playwright would say, 'there's the rub'. And by this I mean that the film is a bit all over the place. It's a costume drama, it's a romance, it's a period political thriller, it's a military epic, and so forth. It even skids the fantasy genre with some of the fancy camera work that was done. But, all in all, the film's primary thrust is to try and grab hold of all of these genres, and tie them together into some kind of cohesive and suscint manner.The romance, the intrigue, the sisterly emotions, the rivalry between matriarchs, and the 'battle scene' hearken back to a time when Hollywood used to crank out these kinds of movies with some regularity. But the context between those films and 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' are nearly day and night, even though both are striving for a high water mark in historical drama.I thought 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' was technically a competent production. In fact, given the difficulties there must have been getting some of the shots I'll give it high marks as a pure production effort. But as a film I simply found it to be a touch too ambitious, and over-indulgent near the end.That's not to say that I didn't enjoy a lot of the film, because I did. Blanchet's Elizabeth is a strong woman; full of zest, energy, and a bit of anger, which she levels at her adversaries. But she's also a chief of state, internationalist, and, of course, the queen of England. She doesn't wear several hats. She wears a crown. But even so, and this is where the film falls a bit short, she doesn't demonstrate a cohesive ability to command all. She shows she's in charge, but doesn't act like she's in charge until near the end.The film was geared and aimed at a female audience (a thing which I had not expected), and so a lot of the energy is directed at that audience, with the appropriate emotional flourishes. Combined with some so-so CGI for the action sequences (and a horse with a perm which almost had me laughing), one wonders where the film was headed. Elizabeth didn't save England with her emotional power alone, and yet this is the gist of the film. It's a real let down in this regard.The film is a mixed blessing. There's a lot of decent acting, and some exceptional performances by the leads. Married to a rather extravagant art director to bring to life palace, throne room, chambers, and galleons at sea, and one can easily see that this was meant to be a top notch production. But some of the logical loopholes where Blanchet's character is concerned conspire with some of the story loopholes to hold back a better film.As a guy all I can say is that it's not something I'd watch again, and I'm not too sure I'd recommend it to any female audiences. But, if you don't mind your period dramas skirting the edge of high kamp, then splurge on a ticket, and see what 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is all about.",Null,58,86,16 October 2007
Beowulf," Robert Zemeckis; 'What would have taken us two days, we shot in two hours...'
","... or words to that effect, and, to be exceedingly honest, that scene and all the rest look like they were shot in two hours. That's no compliment.Admittedly, in the intermediate long run, this is 'the future' of movies. Even so, Zemeckis really put a chagrin on my face. I could picture this film being shot on location in Sweden or Norway, with real actors and real sets. Admittedly this film was engineered for the IMAX format, and so it was geared for that kind of big-splashy entertainment, but, even so, again, to repeat, I simply could not get away from the sense that the real tale could have been told without all the CGI.When I heard about this project I was hoping someone would do something better than the version that was shot in Iceland, and released a year or two before. Visually, the IMAX version is far more impressive, but artistically falls flat as a convincing piece of entertainment. If you want to shoot your scenes in two-hours, and crank out this kind of film, then more power to you. Personally, I would advise against it. The end result speaks for itself.The other thing about this film was the writing. The story execution was fairly cliché, and not just because it's a classic tale. No. It's because Zemeckis, for whatever reason, tried to make this tale and the film more within the reach of the mainstream audience. An admirable effort, though probably more understandable given the fact that the film was aimed at the D&D/Lord-of-the-Rings audience than classic myth and/or historical film aficionados.The Beowulf tale has intrigued many directors, and someday, someone, somewhere, will get it right. The best version or iteration of the tale I've ever seen on the big screen was the screen adaptation of Chriton's 'Eaters of the Dead' tale. A real sense of realism combined with a historical context and heroism. That, verse this tale which sits solidly in the realm of fantasy.I wasn't too interested in seeing the film, but after thumbing through the conceptual art book, and thinking to myself 'This looks really good...' Well, just as you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't judge a film by its published conceptual art. And again, I'm not really baffled so much as chagrined that another version of the Norse myth has missed its mark, particularly when the art in the book looked far superior than the final product; i.e. the visual material within the film itself.But, maybe someday someone will really run with this tale.

","That's what I told the guy sitting next to me in the theatre in South San Francisco off of 280 when he and I exchanged some thoughts on the then new Star Wars film.It was fun to see, but Disney's film is handicapped by the following; this film didn't come on the heels of 30+ years of ultra- serious dramas or very corny musicals, where sci-fi was a thing given to kiddies or the 'brainiacs' or 'nerds' who liked to engage in technical and scientific things, but who didn't date much (note the sexual undercurrent in a lot of sci-fi from the 50s and 60s).Star Wars, the original 1977 feature film, had that benefit. There was 2001 Space Odyssey, Logan's Run the year before with its awful miniatures, and the Star Trek TV series that had been canceled a few years before, but effects technology at the time was more miss than hit, and the genre itself, other than classic Star Trek, really wasn't taken all that seriously. So when Star Wars hit the screen people were blown away by it.The Force Awakens, or more specifically the people who made it, know they can't repeat those conditions that gave the 1977 film that 'wow effect', so it steers more towards a graphic-novel like presentation, complete with emotional intrigue among the characters to try and compliment that large SFX wizardry that's presented on screen.But that's kind of the draw back to The Force Awakens. It's a victim of its own circumstances where we have lots of effects heavy films in the Superhero genre and other tangential scifi sub-genres already tumbling out of Hollwood studios, one after the other. Therefore any visual bedazzlement from The Force Awakens needs to be fairly spectacular to compete with and against the other films. Do we get that? In some respect. The effects are impressive, but the story elements they're meant to accentuate, at times, seem a bit odd.Storywise there's a real attempt to re-invent the basic story for the whole saga, taking some cues from graphic-novel story conventions. Which in turn gives the film a very 2000's kind of look and feel. The visual presentation and interweaving romantic- tension subplots is a very post 80's story telling style, of which I am not a fan. It is my opinion that the story is the story. A romance or sexual tension can be part of that story, but today is meant to run parallel to the main-story as a backdrop thread to appease those who have interests in such matters. The final summation implies that the romance is just as important as needing to defeat the bad guys or overcome the harrowing situation. And, to be brutally honest, both men and women know that that is not true in any situation where this is the setting.And ultimately this is why I liked the film as a Sunday afternoon kind of affair; couch, summer-Sunday, window open, maybe the fan running slightly in the background, maybe your dog sleeping next to you or in a cool spot of the house, and you have this thing on at a low volume as you lay back and watch it with nothing else to do. To me that's the kind of movie this is.It lacks grit, uses conventional modern Disney story telling styles to recirculate the death star plot from the 1977 feature film. And where 1977's film prepared my generation for social and personal challenges in a world that would increasingly rely on tech, this film posits more romantic and interpersonal preparation for a multi- ethnic world. To me that message is many days late and several dollars short.The exit of a major character, the under-exposition of classic characters, a reliance on a plot already used, doesn't really add up to neither an outstanding nor poor film experience, but one that just happens to be. It's almost like a social commentary on what already is, and a warning against the regurgitation of past ideologies. My last observation is that this is aimed at the teen-aged children of the teenagers and pre-teens who saw the film way back in 1977. Which I think makes for an odd film making and directorial style, because we're not exposed to classic film making here, but someone's idea of what today's teens want to see. That includes that exit of a major character, which seemed hammy and nearly anti-climactic; i.e. no 'disturbances in the force' was felt because of this. A dramatic moment that felt like a real over the top story point that had no emotional impact, as it should have. I guess the best one could say is that if Disney had produced Star Wars, then this is the result we would get. I think that's the fairest statement anyone can make, and all that it implies.Watch at your risk, but maybe relax while doing so.",Null,1,7,24 July 2016
Cinderella," Enchanting.
","Walter Disney was not a great animator himself, but a great innovator and caterer to what people loved most about life, and the good things life has to offer. He made his films always with this regard at the forefront. From Snow White, to Bambi, Dumbo and all of the other classic tales that he lifted from folklore and history, and, like a deity of animation, breathed life into characters that were once trapped on pages in library books.'Cinderella' is no different, and we see a gentle and simple tale of honesty come forth as the young girl who means no harm to anyone must overcome adversity aimed at her in the form of jealousy. An active attempt to keep her down and in her place as we see a contest of power among sisters in name only. There is almost a kind of Jane Goodall quality as we see the new matriarch push aside the offspring of the father's previous love so that her brood can benefit from the resources created by the previous marriage. Cinderella, the once much loved daughter of the household, is now relegated to servitude. But even here her spirit cannot be quelled. For in her labor lies love, and her friends, the various fauna that populate the household grounds and walls, keep her spirits up. She is isolated from people and society, but soldiers on.It is a basic story telling of how seeking consolence from another object of affection can adversely effect that which one loves; i.e. the father remarrying someone whose motives are less than altruistic. But, in the end, it is the stalwartness of the royal seneschel who knows only that his duty must be performed at the behest of the crown, for therein lies honor. And it is thus that Cinderella sees that her one moment to shine has been rewarded through an artifact of military etiquette.It's a lovely film to watch and see. There're no real deep messages, but the story reminds us that delving hastily into new relations where matters of the heart are concerned, can be perilous if the previous party has been wounded. But, it also shows us that it is trusting your heart that brings about, for lack of a better term, good things. It is a story that reminds us that opportunists may crush that which we hold dear, and unless a miracle is forth coming, the likes of which Cinderella experienced, bad things may continue to persist.Technical notes; lots of inbetweens to show us animation so smooth that nothing has been rendered like since CGI, and even CGI comes across as highly mechanical and precision oriented, a raw juxtaposition from the innate intuition of the artists who animate with gentle feeling. This is what makes Cinderella such a beautiful visual for us to sit, watch and absorb. I feel like I should have more to say, but, other than the fact that it's a wonderful film, I'm at a loss for words. Watch it, and enjoy.",9,0,1,22 March 2012
Kagemusha," Not one of Kurosawa's best.
","Kurosawa said it himself, this is a film that was designed as a dress rehearsal for 'RAN', and you can see it. Kagemusha has a lot of experimentation with shots, colors, and a fairly loose editing style with a kind of free form structure. It's essentially a giant experimentation for what could work in a film, and what doesn't. The style is fairly rushed as well. The kind of care or calculated artwork that we'd normally get from a Kurosawa film is simply not here.That's not to say that the film is bad, because it isn't, but the kind of careful craftsmanship that we're so used to with a Kurosawa has been given some high octane fuel, and as such we don't get shots that linger too long on one subject. Not shots that are muted in tone. We get lots of moving shots as well; pans, a few subtle zooms, and the occasional tracking shot. This isn't normal for a Kurosawa film. Again, here we have a kind of 'let's shoot this to see what we've got' kind of movie. The culmination of which we will eventually see in the film he shot afterwards; 'RAN'.'Kagemusha' is also a bit of a departure for Kurosawa in that it deals with real historical events and characters. Most of the films I've seen by Kurosawa have dealt with traditional fiction. But here we a kind of docudrama, albeit altered for dramatic effect and for the big screen. Again, not such a big deal here, because the film does work.Lots of people heap praises on this film, and where I admit to its craftsmanship, it's essentially a preparation for another film. Watch it for what it's worth and enjoy what you can.",Null,1,1,31 August 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," '2896 comments in total'
","And counting. I'm guessing mine will make it 2897 :-) What to say about the Pete Jackson rendition that hasn't been said. Well, I saw all three films in the theatre, and was entertained. You can't really ask for anything more. There may be some deep hidden message encoded somewhere, but I couldn't find it.Tolkien 'borrowed' from Wagner, who borrowed from others, and so on and so on. Tolkien's works are, in his own words during a filmed interview, an homage to the King James version of the Judeo Christian bible. If that's the case, then I'm a little hard pressed to find anything of any real meaning in either written work or filmed interpretation.Don't get me wrong. I had the Hobbit read to me when I was about three or four. Read the book for myself a few years later, and took a stab at the more massive 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy after that. I liked the stories. I found them entertaining, and wanted to add my own little niche of 'Blueghostliness' to Tolkien's world, but I didn't pick up any deep spiritual nor philosophical underpinnings, as so many a Tolkien fan have in the past (and presumably still do).There's the whole nature verse mechanical theme going on, and a few others operating. And if you can find that in either books or films, then more power to ya :-) For me, I find both books and films respectable entertainment. If anything, I think the films are ever so marginally over the top a-la Pete Jackson's style. That doesn't make them bad, just not the classics that I think a lot of people are making them out to be.You have to love and admire the amount of work that went into these films. You really do. If you don't like the characters, then like the setting. If you don't like that, then like the music. If that fails you, then like the SFX. If you're still not finding salvageable, then just be glad that someone finally took on this project, and put it on screen.My nitpicks; the pointy helmets of the Gondor soldiers. If I understand correctly this may have been an homage to the Rankin Bass animated Hobbit film from the 70s. Meh... they just don't do it for me. And the CGI, to me, is more hit than miss, but some of it still looks plastic.All in all this is a classic 'Hollywood' take on what's been labeled by many a bookstore as a modern set of classical literature. It's got big characters, huge spectacle, lots of drama (heartfelt, though not really deep), and production values that should impress the most jaded of Tolkien fantasy types.I saw all three films. I was entertained. I don't think they're classics. But I liked what I saw.There's not much more I can add than that. :-)",Null,1,2,21 April 2009
The Matrix," Review number 3605 :)
","I think now I get the appeal of Tarantino's film. Lots of action, lots of philosophical intrigue, lots of mixing of action with a very extreme sci-fi 'what if' which questions existence.Combine that with state of the art SFX and some interesting scripting, and you got yourself one entertaining film. You might call it a re-invention of the martial arts genre American-style, complete with gun battles and a high degree of computer-techno cyber-punk wizardry.After seeing Tarantino's take on the Hong-Kong / Taiwanese, and Chinese coveted martial arts genre, I think I understand a bit better younger audiences impatience with older action films, or sci fi films that tend to be a bit more ponderous than Tarantino's films.A lot of the shots in this film and the subsequent sequels, are shots that a lot of film makers have been wanting to do for eons, but lacked the SFX know how to pull them off. Tarantino's done them, and it appears that he has many imitators.Now, having given it praises, to my middle aged sensibilities, I thought it was a bit out there story wise, though I did appreciate the story, and understood every aspect of it. Even so, it is an intriguing premise, and should keep the hard core sci-fi action film fan entertained.The sequels get a bit more over the top in staging, including the animated film. But it's a fascinating franchise all the same. It's not for the feint of heart because of all the action and shifting of realities, but it is very interesting all the same.Give it a shot and see what you think.",Null,0,2,6 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," May the Force be with You! :-)
","Okay, so it's a hot San Juoquin Valley summer afternoon in Sacramento, and I'm there with the parent outside one of the old brown dome Century theatres on opening day for this thing. In addition to the blistering Sacramento summer sun there's a slight hot breeze, but I'm in the shade with the family, so it's not a big deal. I'm just happy to be waiting for that space movie I heard about on TV. I'm just hoping it won't be scary.The doors open, and we go inside, and are given a booklet of some-kind describing the characters, places and back-story. Neat :-) I flip through it, see some color pages, see some black and white pages, and don't really understand a thing of what I'm looking at or reading. Rebels? Imperials? Huh? Who, what, where, when? And... why?Oh well. The lights dim and the movie starts. I'm just hoping I don't see the wires on the 'special effect' models. The lights dim, that blue font opening line appears, then the scrolling text. Hey, this is just like that Flash Gordon thing I saw on TV ... well ... almost. The story stuff vanishes up into space, and the camera pans down.Thank god, I think, this doesn't look too fake. Hopefully it'll be a little better than Star Trek on TV where the effects go. Then the two ships race by overhead. And you can pick up the collective psychic connection of every sci-fi type sighing in relief and saying to themselves 'Thank God! Somebody finally got it right!'Yeah, it was a WOW moment. Star Wars re-heralded old fashioned film making. In a day and age of the 70s when edgy art films were all the rage, and old overweight police detectives dominated the TV air waves. Oh sure, 'King Kong' came out the year before, but sci-fi was more of a 1950's genre, because at that time that's when most of those films had been made.Star Wars was a much needed relief from a lot of over wrought films that were promoting some kind of new social stigma. Where were the heroics? Where were the cavaliers? Where was the derring-do that we used to see? Well, it was back in a piece of high-adventure space-opera. :-)Star Wars is a film about human endeavor, and the value of heart and soul. It's not a codified social statement as much of science fiction tends to be, but a true fairy tale to take the viewer and audience to a time and place where there are clear boundaries between right and wrong. In the day and age of the Cold War with proxy wars happening around the globe, and with the memory of Vietnam still fresh in everyone's memory (and Afghanistan coming into the forefront), Star Wars was a unifying reminder of the consequences of delegating freedom to a kind of social automation of the spirit; i.e. allowing extreme organization and ceremony to act as a mechanism for social order, the consequences of that, and how a single soul can combat such stalwart foes.Personally, I love the film for what it is. As a kid I bought the Marvel comics' adaptations, bought the sketch and art books because I loved the artistry of the film as a whole, but I never bought any of the action figures. I bought the magnificent soundtrack, but not the toys. I also never had a favorite character. Nor did I ever really get into the story too much, though I liked the story. Add to that, I understood people liking the film, because it was very entertaining, but I couldn't understand the extreme fandom that accompanies it to this very day.But hey, that's just me :-) Truth is I do understand some of the fandom, but I'm not really a Star Wars fan as such. Love the films. I worked for a couple of the SFX guys when I was in my 20s, and was even offered a job up at ILM after working my tail off to impress those guys, but I liked the spectacle of the films more than the message, because the message was pretty basic. And I guess that's the real charm of Star Wars for tons of people the world over.It's a basic positive message with some fantastic artistry. Personally, I also happen to think it's the film director's personal story; i.e. a young man striking out on his own and facing adversity, and that resonates with people everywhere. It might explain the age demographic demarcation between young and old SW fans in terms of liking the newer films and the 'classic' SW films. But perhaps that's another post for another time.In the meantime, May the Force Be With You. :-)",Null,0,1,20 September 2009
50_50," It's good, but it could've been better.
","I know, I know; you're saying 'Mister Blueghost, what in the world didn't you like about this film?' Well, first off I did like it for what it was. BUT, and this is the director in me talking, you don't survive stage 4 cancer of any kind. Personal experience tells me this. If the plot of the film had been given a slightly higher emphasis instead of a casual nod (i.e. the mechanics of what the cancer was actually doing to our leading man), then the film would've shined.As it stands now, we have a writer (or writing team) that dropped the ball on a number of issues. First of all films focus on the emotional elements of all stories that they tell, but here we got a real sugar coated ending that makes for a film that I really wouldn't care to see again. Modern marketing dictates that we get an upbeat film to keep drawing in ticket goers. Ergo, what's-his-name survives not only the surgery, but the cancer itself. No ambiguity about it.But hey, it's essentially another chick flick married to the buddy-flick genre. Implication; happy ending.But, what would've made for a better market draw over the long run would have been the ambiguity of survival at the end. Dude gets the girl at the end. Dude survives to get the girl. But we're never privy to the entire cancer experience, just his perspective on how it effects his social life, and nothing more. We don't see his personal insights, not really. We see his mood flux, but not a different perspective on the world. We don't get the sense that he's changed too much for his entire experience. We really don't.He lives. He comes out on top, and his friend is the best friend anyone in the world could ask for. But for all that we don't see a real adjustment in character. Which begs the question if there really needs to be on in the first place. Meh, maybe not, but if you survive a life threatening experience, then you're bound to have a different outlook on how the world looks, feels, smells, sounds and just vibes in general. I'm not sure we really get that.The film is what it is. It was a little too raunchy in terms of the sexual language for my taste, but it got its point across with great alacrity.My vote is that this is a sugar coated cancer film that could have been much more than it ultimately became, but it's a decent flick for what it is.Rated-R for language and some mild sexual situations, it's not exactly a family film.Take a chance on it, and judge for yourself.*eidt; 11/27/11* p.s. a bit of a remake of the Italian film 'One for Two'.",Null,1,2,11 October 2011
Ran," Masterpiece.
","What can anyone say that hasn't been said already about this film? It's a commercial release of one of the most artistic plays ever, and rendered by the most artistically minded film maker in the history of cinema. Who could create such a thing?I speak of none other than the magnificent Akira Kurosawa, the grand master of all film making, and the epitome of his work in the samurai genre, 'RAN'.'RAN' explores the turmoil caused by the child who knows only himself, and dismisses all that he should hold dear and valuable. But our main protagonist Hidetora raised his children on the values of unbridled warfare; how to betray a friend, turn him into an enemy, and conquer him ruthlessly. Yet he is utterly shocked when his own offspring treat him thus, and sent into a psychosis from which only a loved one can retrieve him.Edward De'Vere's play focused on three daughters who use their wiles to manipulate and scheme against one another, and thus inflict and strike the same madness in their father. But Kurosawa takes the story and give it a new bent by turning the daughters into sons for the would be Shogun of Japan. This adds a new twist, and gives more than just the usual visual hyperbole that many remakes of films do to their predecessors by actually adding to the story material. The manipulation is still there, but it is the men who are driven by a lust for power and wealth, the one thing they inherited from their father.Note the color schemes of the sons. Note the eldest in Gold, his ascendancy to the family throne. The second son shows Red, and his thirst to replace his eldest brother. The third son, the youngest, donned in blue, and it is the color that comes forth at the end when Hidetora regains himself, and as we also look up at the sky with the characters, and ask the gods why they are so cruel. Indeed, what hath god wrought upon this segment of feudal Japan? A land where its borders are set apart from anything tangible we know about that period in Japan's history. It is truly an imaginary tale, but one fraught with the historic realities of those striving for dominance in a system that knew only swords and plowshares.But it is not the men who are the only samurai. There is indeed a woman who takes on the spiritual semblance of the vampire, and drives the story forward to render justice for her family, now lost to Hidetora's exploits. She is perhaps a samurai above all the others.It is a slow film. It is a grande film. It is spectacle mixed with the frailties and cruelties and, at the end, devotions of the human heart. We see the splash and splendor of the colors, the utter destruction of a society that has put faith in military-wit and lost its heart and soul. We see one disaster follow another, and we also see those who come in to assist the true, and those that come into to clean the chaos that has reigned. Note the old lord in Act Three whose forces are in white. They look down with smiles and applaud the efforts below of those they love. Note the color of the army that assails the Red uniformed forces of the angry second son.Artistry encapsulated.Now, technically it is supremely shot, there isn't too much to criticize here save for one or two SFX shots. The scope and scale of the production is enormous. And for all of the spectacle presented in this epic, it does not lose its intimacy. We see moments of passion, moments of truth, moments of betrayal and moments of solitude. Shot composition and lens selection does not miss a beat. Whether we're looking at a long shot, or a close-up. There is of course the famous montage battle sequence that many have tried to duplicate, but have never achieved. Married to some incredible music accentuating the segment, we see cinematography at its best.This is a long film. It is a long epic film made for and by a Japanese film maker, but a film that can touch all on an emotional level. It will try the patience of the average viewer, particularly younger viewers, but if you're a film aficionado, then this film is for you.Watch and enjoy.ADDENUDM; Oh wow, apparently three prostitutes didn't like my review.

Gangs of New York," Over the top.
","I normally don't comment on popular films, but I'd heard a lot about this one, so I gave it a whirl on the old DVD player. And I had a hard time coming to terms with what I saw, but saw it I did.Ho boy.I have to confess, I'm not a big Scorsese fan, but I've nothing against the man either, and have enjoyed several of his films. Yet this film really makes me wonder what's happened to the cinema going public when a film as predictable and flimsy as this gains artistic recognition. Not only is it predictable, but it's also just over-done on a number of levels.Scorsese puts such a whopper of a caricature spin on all sides that I found it difficult to buy into the film's reality. I've no doubt the real people upon which the film's characters are based were brutal thugs, but the Satanic equivocation with the antagonist is just too much for me to take. The man is shown to have values, but is also immersed in such an evil dour that one wonders why he's even in the movie at all. Scorsese might as well just stuck a guy holding a pitchfork and wearing horns on his head in the role. Day-Lewis'es character has a political and moral position (however skewed), but it's never fully explored, and is so framed as being evil by Scorsese that one wonders why this character was allowed to express his view at all.Likewise with DiCaprio's role. Again, another fine actor is placed in a position where he must portray a character whose roots are given a divine essence. As if everything he stands for and values is held in a blessed light. For myself, this smacks of the so-called need to define the 'white hats' and 'black hats' for the audience. And when you need to do that, then you might as well be writing a children's novel, because the author has just demonstrated his lack of respect for the audiences' ability to come to their own conclusion.This kind of social commentary and politicking is done without apology. The result is a film that's pretty thin, and again reveals the inner heart of a man, Scorsese, who himself cannot give a good accounting of the riots, because his presentation does not gybe with the hard facts of the genesis and result of the conflict. And when I say facts I mean that which motivated these people to pillage and plunder mid-1800's New York.Scorsese did his best. My hats off to him. There're few directors who could've tackled such a project, and Scorsese gave it his best shot. But this film, for all its garnished praises, falls far from demonstrating the true hearts of human beings, and gives us cartoon characters from, what George Parker from Orange County, CA called an 'Over-wrought melodramatic history-fiction mishmash.' I couldn't agree more.Most of you who have expressed interest in my views on films will probably already have seen this, so it's a moot point for me to recommend it or not in this review. But, on the odd chance that you haven't, and are interested, and are reading my comments, as well as others, don't say we didn't warn you if come away from this film feeling somewhat disappointed.Corporate art strikes again. Next time Mr. Scorsese please follow your own instincts, or just make a small budgeted indy film with your personal stamp on it.",Null,1,2,20 January 2005
Gladiator," I liked it, but it could have been more.
","Somewhere in history the purveyors of psychology and psychiatry infected and influenced how media operates and presents stories. The positive is that the stories have weightier impact on the movie going public. But there's an obvious downside;The movies have no morals.They are valueless.So it is with 'Gladiator' and the screenplay upon which this film is based. The characters are depicted as having motivations nested deep within their psyche, when in truth no such aspect was present in the real historic figures, notably Commodious. Crowe's Maximus is also similarly one-dimensional, such that the film can be nothing more than a revenge flick set in Imperial Rome.On top of this Ridley Scott, an excellent visual director, struggles to find palpable story material. And for a lack of it, tosses in a surreal or spiritual element that seems wholly out of place. Particularly when depicted with processed shots to show his ultimate goal and desires. Do we really need to see time lapse photography and surreal dream sequences representing the 'afterlife'? It's confusing because this film isn't about religious issues. In theory, at least, it's about a man trying to contend with some spoiled tyrants psychological short comings. Which should give the astute viewer pause. Recall your classic sword- and-sandal epics. Oh, say, 'Spartacus'. How psychologically damaged were any of the characters in 'Spartacus'? How about 'Ben Hur'? 'Cleopatra'? Anybody? How about any film before 1970?Answer; zero.But, we progress through the social 'revolutions' of the 1960s, and suddenly there is no right and wrong. Everything is relative, and acts of evil must be caused by some form of child abuse or other emotional trauma.Was there ever a bigger lie foisted on the public?And this is why 'Gladiator' fails to be a whole movie, but a palpable one to watch. It's theme and morals are lacking because they were never there to begin with. The honor of a general really has nothing to contend against, because the antagonist is so logically vilified that we know the outcome before the film is over with.That, and 'Gladiator' lacked money. The original ending would have had Maximus's army colliding with Rome's Praetorian guard. A visual feast worthy of the cinematic talents of Ridley Scott. But, instead, we get this mano-a-mano crescendo that feels like a low budget alternative, because hey, it is.Gladiator had the promise of being a whole film. It really did. It's a magnificent piece to watch. Brilliantly staged and shot, but it so misses in the thematic department that one might as well watch a baseball game. I'm quite serious about that.Heck, even 'The Ten Commandments', the epitome of religious film making, and this comment comes from an atheist, had more heart and soul than 'Gladiator'. And that's really too bad, because I happen to like elements of 'Gladiator', but again, it's a half baked film like so much other mental-health drivel that's been cranked out in the last thirty years.This is why Roger Ebert astutely observed that this film feels like it's about more than it actually is. I would take that bit of profundity further, and apply to every so called modern adult film produced in the last three decades, and let the morons who've taken film making into a direction that sensationalizes emotion, but sucks the life out of hear, mind and soul. It is the reason classics will always remain classics, and why we've seen no classics since the 1960s. Just pretty tabloids disguising themselves as issue driven films, when in reality values are truncated, and the esteem of the emotional health of the individual is placed on the throne.So it is with 'Gladiator'. Imperial Rome didn't suffer from abused children. It's worst aspects were created by criminals who didn't care about what happened to their fellow man, because they wanted things their way. So it is with history. And so should it have been with 'Gladiator'.All in all, a watchable film for the fight sequences, but hardly the cinematic experience other reviews would lead you to believe.",Null,0,1,8 August 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Decent Entertainment
","I liked this film, and had a good time watching it with the family in the theatre. Harrison Ford brings us the world renowned archaeologist and hands-on scholar Indiana Jones, Stanford University professor extraordinaire. The great score by John Williams, the ever surpassing and respectable direction by Steven Spielberg, the good performances by the usual suspects, including Harrison Ford himself, are woven into a visual fabric that brings us what everyone thought might be the final installment of the Indiana Jones' series of cinematic adventures.If I had one criticism with this film, and I don't have many, it would be the same observation I had with 'Temple of Doom', and that is I think there may have been one too many effects' shots. I say that guardedly because most of what we see are live action stunts, but there's a few sequences that call attention to themselves, and not just because they're effects' shots either. Example; I think I would have preferred to see real live Messerschmitts' fighting over the Bavarian Alps as opposed to American Warhawks dressed up as German fighters, and miniatures thereof, doing acrobatics over the Midwest (meant to represent North Africa I suppose). But, how much would it have cost? That's the whole purpose of special effects; to bring to the audience that which is too expensive or impossible to deliver through live conventional means. As such, even here I don't fault the film too much.Sean Connery's take on Indy's father was unique and unexpected. I think most everyone was expecting a tough guy performance from Connery, but instead we get very much the academician, though he seems to come around by the film's end (much to the pleasure of all). The films' execution itself seems quick and dirty, despite some of the lengths that were gone into dressing up sets and locations. The film has a kind of roughness to it in spite of all of the refined elements gives it an edge.I think the real thing that I missed from 'Raiders' that lacks in the subsequent four films, is that as Spielberg stated on the bonus DVD in the Indiana Jones trilogy DVD set, is that unlike 'Raiders' the other films had a contemporary look to them in terms of camera work. Spielberg stated that in a conversation with his DP that they were going to give 'Raiders' an old fashioned look. And that strategy works magnificently for the kind of film that it is and was meant to be. I think that element is missing in the followup films, and I think they suffer some for it. An old fashioned movie needs an old fashioned feel, because quite honestly it heightens the experience, and, to my way of thinking, added a nice finishing sheen to the visuals to make 'Raiders' look more authentic and artistic. But that's just me.'Last Crusade' is still a fine film. Worthy of a night's viewing.Enjoy.",Null,0,0,15 January 2013
