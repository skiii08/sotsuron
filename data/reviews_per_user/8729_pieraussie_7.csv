Hereditary," Don't watch it
","Do believe the negative reviews, the movie is really really bad and it makes no sense. Don't watch it.",1,3,8,19 September 2019
Us," Boring
","I am afraid Peel will be the new M.Night Shyamalan, that after his first great work, The Sixth Sense, directed a long series of disappointing movies. 'Get Out' was good, this 'Us' is bad. Boring, no scary, and it did not make any sense at all.",1,0,2,20 December 2019
The Irishman," Stay clear
","The worst Scorsese movie of all times. Believe all the negative reviews, there is nothing more I could add.",1,26,49,2 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," My cut
","The movie is too long, with unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the story. Accidentally is nearly all the scenes where Di Caprio is on stage without Pitt plus the one where Robbie goes to the movies. So what I have done? I made my own cut editing all that fluff, it was 39 minutes of boredom, on a dvd. Tarantino obviously has only yes men around and that is not good for him. Let's have a party with my version and icy beers.",7,0,3,15 May 2020
Gone Girl," Next
","I haven't read all the reviews about this disappointing movie, but most of them will tell you about the incredible holes in the plot, from Amy's invisible wound (2 pints of blood spilled in the kitchen and not visible cuts?) to the blood left on her at the hospital. The movie is so annoying, Affleck never changes expression for 148 minutes, dialogues are cheap and boring, cops are dumb, his father is at the police station at the start for no reason at all and I could mention other hundreds things that you can read in other reviews too. Do not watch this movie or you will hate yourself for doing it for two reasons:1) if you hate it like it should be you will hate yourself for wasting 2.5 hours and maybe some money 2)if you like it you'll find out you are a moron and that is not good news.",2,1,6,19 July 2015
A Quiet Place," B movie
","Mild scary movie with no explanations about the creatures, dumb behaviors (going barefoot with the chance to hurt your feet and then scream for pain instead) and illogical choices (choosing to live in the woods instead of a less accessable site like a 50th floor in a bulding for example). It would make a decent 50's B movie but in 2018 it's just lazy writing, they did not even bothered of writing dialogues. It's a short movie and that is a positive thing. Michael Bay is involved, enough said.",5,2,3,17 January 2019
Jurassic World," Average
","If you're looking for a movie: with bad actors, no humour, too long, politically correct, with great special effects, hairdos that never move whatever happens, happy ending and interesting to 7yo this is the movie for you.",6,2,3,28 April 2019
