Casablanca," Contrasting with Citizen Kane
","Citizen Kane and Casablanca are two innovative films from the 1940's, yet they differ in genre and style.  While Casablanca has a relatively straightforward love story complete with wartime propaganda, Citizen Kane has a narrative structure as a dialectical montage. Casablanca has depth of characters, themes of love, power, valor and sacrifice put together with straight narrative: Boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy tries to get girl back. Citizen Kane, on the other hand makes use of rich differing styles. It begins with the expressionistic death, then is interrupted with the newsreel and booming voice-of-god, then moves into the projection room with reporters, shadows and smoke.Casablanca, however, makes great use of good dialogue and strong focus on the actors as deep characters.  Redemption is also something achieved at the end at the cost of love.  Citizen Kane has strong composition in depth and shadows, low camera angles, and the complicated handling of the narrative point of view.",Null,0,0,31 October 2000
Life Is Beautiful," Social commentary, satire
","*** SPOILER WARNING ***
The social commentary and satire of 'Life is Beautiful' was portrayed wonderfully through the acting talent of Benigni and his physical comedy. Guido's imagination and ingenuity show the triumph of the human spirit despite the ugliness of the days of Hitler.  Rather than rub the tragedy of that era in the viewer's face, writer, director and actor Benigni does the opposite, minimizing brutality and violence seen, in effect using reverse psychology to show how sad that time really was.  Guido as he's taken away to be killed is smiling at his child and exaggerating his march so the boy won't be scared.  He isn't even allowing himself grief, perhaps being more deprived than those who allow themselves the sadness. The costume design was also excellent, using period pieces without being overdone.  The way the costumes looked in the beginning with the happier portion of the film worked well, with bright colors, moving to drab colors when Guido and his son had to go to the concentration camp.  The costumes helped serve as a backdrop (along with the set) for the time and tragedy of the period.",Null,1,3,31 October 2000
