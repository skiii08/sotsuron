Vertigo," Deemed as great, I'll go with ....very good!
","This film has been heralded as Hitchcock's greatest masterpiece, his most personal thriller and a major classic. Its even ranked in the IMDb top 50. That's all very impressive and while I can't say I don't like the movie, I'm not willing to get quite that giddy with praise. I just watched it again, the magnificently restored version, in Hi Def. That's also very impressive. So where does it fall short of its lofty historic ranking for me, hard to say without sounding awfully nit-picky. Maybe it is nit-picky. The lush San Fransico background is amazing. The artwork, the flowers, the surrounding architecture are dazzling. The award winning music score is perfect for 1958 and sets the movie's mood, which changes several times, in lush, often rousing tones. But........ the story, the pacing and even some of the casting has always left me cold. Hitchcock can play a scene for a long time, almost leisurely, to get a MOOD. In 'VERTIGO' they are maddenly leisurely. And the premise of the possessed wife, the concerned husband, the off kilter damaged cop, the insurance con is downright goofy! Especially the race to leap off the building for a dramatic suicide. The part 1 love story can be bought (the con and all!), and well played by the two stars, but the part 2 love story is so dark and possessive that it has always smacked of mean spirited to me. Now the casting. Jimmy Stewart has never taken a false step, but at age 50, despite his perfectly coiffed toupee and heavy makeup still looks it. Kim Novak, despite the worst eyebrows in cinema history, is a ravishing early 20's and looks it. The fake and then real attraction to Stewart is hard to imagine. Especially when the apparently lonely (how could she be) and distraught Novak, who really loved Jimmy, has heaps of humiliation piled on her by the dark and damaged Stewart. It threw my 'suspension of belief' off a bit. And the surprisingly attractive Barbara Del Geddes (pre-Dallas Matron) is supposed to be Stewart's old college chum!! He must have been post, post grad and she was Freshman. Hey, I said it was nit-picky!!I've read that the movie was actually poorly received and attended during its initial release. And that was at the height of Stewart's and Hitchcock's powers. The supreme inventive director of his day, he used interesting angles and zooming in and out cameras to get all his desired affects of vertigo. If there was better entertainment around in '58, with more star power, I'd be surprised, so why not a hit?? Were people nit-picky then too??",8,2,3,11 September 2010
That Thing You Do!," I can't not watch this --- its a kinder, gentler 'Commitments'!!
","This is a hugely entertaining movie that was overlooked during its theatrical release, but now seems to have a great following. And why not, the all-American story of a 60's garage band 'success'! As a '64 HS grad (please don't do the math!), I enjoyed the story, music and performances. And thank God they came up with a catchy title tune (you hear it in total or bits about 15 times) as it never seems to get old.Infectious performances by a budding cast of near miss and future stars, the setting, music, locations, Play-tunes tours, network TV shows and the inevitable band break-up all ring true. The amazing thing to me is that given Tom Hanks' success, his appearance in the film (as well as writer/director hats), its up and coming cast and reasonable studio push, the movie wasn't a big box office success. Oh well, I never missed it when I passed it on the cable dial, now have it DVR'd when I need a boost, and recommend it to fans of all involved. It will not disappoint!!",9,0,0,21 June 2007
Nacho Libre," Funny idea, world-class comedian...but no laughs!!
","Boy, I was surprised by this movie. The story line sounded great and Jack Black can and has been very funny ('High Fidelity', 'School of Rock', MTV Awards, even 'Saving Silverman'), but this is shockingly unfunny. Some of the movie's gags require a long and tedious build up, like the quest for the Eagle's egg, with no payoff whatsoever (was the egg yolk on his face the funny part?). Scenes at a party with Jack and his sidekick have a beginning, a middle and just fade out to a non-finish (was the corn on the cob in the eye the funny part?).I usually like politically incorrect comedies, sprinkled with some of the deadpan humor on display here, and that's the reason for the 5/10 score. Jack's slightly mangled Spanish caused me to smile, as well as some classic facial ticks of his. But, it didn't make up for the uninspired wrestling scenes, a 'forbidden' romance that was neither sweet nor touching and gags without payoffs. The fact that this stuff can make $80 - 100 Mil @ the box office, will only encourage more. Jack Black's career shouldn't be defined by being fearless about showing off his pudgy body, but by a devilish streak that bubbles just beneath the surface.",5,5,9,4 January 2007
The Town," /taut, well acted and edited -- see it!
","The Ben Affleck saga is well chronicled in these reviews. Pretty boy hunk, to blockbuster star, to paparazzi darling, to yearly 'razzie' nominee. I'm not sure the 'razzies' were warranted, by his movie choices got decidedly weaker as his star was falling. Eventually he took some strong supporting roles to get back on track and now has grabbed the director reins with both hands.'The Town' is placed in and about my loved Boston. 'Ahh, ahh, Boston you're my home'. By choosing Charlestown (now a yuppier 'Chuckville') as its base, the North End for a car chase and the bowels of old (1912) Fenway for the climactic 'last job', he is at home in his surrounding. Anyone who has walked thru the North End, stopped for a 'slice' and checked out the streets knows that's the last place you'd ever expect a high speed car chase. Ben's camera work and editing makes it a thrilling, crash filled event. Pity the poor stunt drivers who has to careen around those corners! So, lots of reviews tell the plot points. I'm just writing to voice my opinion on the entertainment value and that is very high. Though its over two hours, it never drags. Ben gives each of his excellent cast a very strong scene or two. Chris Cooper gets 5 minutes of screen time and is excellent. Rebecca Hall, the prettiest average looking person you'll see, is terrific. Jeremy Renner is calm and explosive, at the same time. Jon Hamm gets to look cool, be cool and stay cool. He is a different FBI than we are used to. Smart, but with a meaner edge. And, for me, last but not least, Blake Lively. I hear she's a glamor girl on TV and red carpets, but here she absorbs the role of broken, damaged and desperate, with a glob of mascara in each eye. One review I read said 'she's no Amy Ryan' (see:'Gone Baby Gone'). Maybe not, but that's pretty unfair and she is well up to the task here. So, action, anti-heroes to 'root' for and Fenway Park (a diamond on the outside, pretty scruffy underneath)!! What's not to like? But I've got to nit-pick one thing. Does everyone in the world have a 3 day beard??? FBI guys go to the office unshaven for days? Ben even has some uneven moments where he goes from 2 to 1 to 3 day beards in the same caper! Hey, what can you do, its not one big long shoot, but it was a lot of stubble!",8,47,84,19 September 2010
The Commitments," The new DVD is out -- it's great!!
","Since hundreds of people have discussed the plot and music aspects of the film, I just want to say that as one of my all-time favorite movies, it was always painful to watch on a 'pan & scan' DVD or washed out VHS tape. Well the new DVD (3/16/04) is fabulous. Brilliant transfer in wide screen mode, all the band members are now visible on stage, and almost 2 hours of extra documentaries and unseen videos. Wow!!And my favorite line from the movie : Jimmy to a boy with a horse (standing by the elevator at an apartment complex): 'You aren't going to put him on the lift are you?'Boy : 'The stairs would kill him!!'",Null,3,5,18 March 2004
Revolutionary Road," Well performed downer! Insightful...........?
","This movie has elicited many '10s' and lots of '2s' from our trusty IMDb readers. That is always interesting to me. A performance is called 'bad community theater' stuff by one viewer, others hail the movie's performances as 'great'.I'm guessing that the depressing nature of watching a suburban couple bemoan their seemingly OK life, and the internal strife of that conflict, is insightful for most, painful for some and irritating for a few.I generally watch movies to be enlightened, entertained or educated. I'd be hard pressed to say this movie did any of those. But, I was enthralled by the performances, which I considered to be as good as they get. A scene of the corporate 'clones' departing the 'burbs for their corporate jobs was sensationally filmed, stunning in is scope and set the tone for the 'robotic' view of suburban life the author/director chose to hang their story on. But this point of view is not enlightening. Kate and Leo, as the struggling suburban couple, argue with the intent to injure, but after reflection, seem to still have the core of affection that originally brought them together. They fight hard, re-group, create a plan to break away and then deteriorate again as the plan slips away.It's not much of a plan. Quit their present life and head to Paris. She'll work, he'll find himself! Other than they are not the 'special' people Kate envisioned they would be, there isn't much to escape from. Is Leo droning out a living? Sure, who didn't! It was post-war USA. But then he's offered a promotion that seems a bit exciting to him, so maybe things are looking up. Kate can't even verbalize what makes them 'special' and why they should escape their 'trapped' life, other than they just should.I felt the movies' 'big cheat', was the role of Kathy Bates' son. An accomplished mathematician, he is deemed different, institutionalized and apparently brutalized. He has had 64 shock treatments for a condition that doesn't appear to warrant such drastic treatment. But, that's life in the 50's. Offbeat is insane. But, he is presented as the person with the real insight! Is it the author's point that 64 shock treatments help see life more clearly. The character gives us the key insightful line in the movie when he proclaims that many admit to the emptiness of suburban life, but that 'it takes real guts to see the hopelessness.' In his only other scene he makes a proclamation to Kate that seals the movie's final fate. Perhaps his unfiltered take on life makes the character viable, but I thought it was too extreme, too convenient. And the use of ex-marital activity by both was intriguing. In both cases it was to feel something, anything! But, I'm babbling. The movie was a well performed downer. We watch a painful slice of life. In fact, if you get the DVD make sure to watch the deleted scenes. The director may have left an Academy Award nomination for DeCaprio on the cutting floor. He has two incredible (i.e. -- not 'community player') scenes that were left out.",7,0,0,21 August 2009
Ghost Rider," I hope we are out of Marvel characters!!!
","I feel a bit guilty writing a negative review of this movie. As another reviewer wisely reminded, it's not like i didn't know it was about a flaming skeleton on a bike!! So I was willing to have some fun with it, and Eva Mendes is only in so many movies, so you HAVE to watch the ones she does.So, 'Ghost Rider', the movie. The plot revolves around the dreaded 'sell your soul to the devil'. However it takes years for the devil to get his end of the deal, so Johnny Blaze (Ghost Rider's Clark Kent) has become a world famous motorcycle stunt rider. Who am I kidding..... the plot developments and character motivations are so goofy, I can't go thru with it.The screenplay is so bad that even a sincere effort by Nick Cage and the breathtaking outfits of Eva Mendes can't save things. For example, in his 1st night as a 'Ghost Rider' (there have been others?????) he causes about $100M in damages and the total superhero activity for the night is that he saves someone from a mugger. The special effects are impressive enough, but I never got a feel for what they were after. Were they suppose to be spooky or comical or dazzling? They wind up much more video game graphics than real. The net result is a 'by the numbers' sequence of battle scenes (he takes out the Big Bad guy's sidekicks - one by one), a rescue of the lovely Eva and a finale that leaves room for an sequel. Please don't! All in all, the reported $110 million budget is up there on the screen, its just nothing I'd want to endure again.",3,0,1,13 June 2007
Blood Diamond," It's a 'flawed' gem, but worth the time (like 143 minutes worth!!)
","This is a movie that tries to be all things to all audiences. Its a conscience tweaker like 'Hotel Rwanda', an action flick and even has the romantic overtones you'd expect from the casting of Leonardo and Jennifer. It's hard to make all three of those jell into a total success, but Zwick has succeeded as well as can be expected.First and foremost it is another gut-wrenching history lesson about the blind eye the world turns towards Africa. Well, that might be unfair given they depict a UN camp of over one MILLION refugees and describe it as the 2nd largest in the country. Since the UN is there supporting the effects, rather than causes of the strife, the 'world' is at least trying to patch up the blowout. I believe this is based in fact. Real Diamond Companies are indicted and real UN resolutions are alluded to.The action flick head of the movie is fast paced, frightfully bloody and given the 'heroes' multiple narrow escapes (as in dodging several thousand bullets) is a total stretch of believability. But the show must go on, greed must be explored, fatherly love must be exalted and journalistic integrity satisfied.The romance is handled well enough, with Jennifer Connelly looking better than ever (and in her case, that is saying a lot!!), Leonardo baring his soul and justifications bit by bit and the seed of a mutual understanding and affection planted.So, these three elements add up to an rather entertaining, satisfying whole, but not without much time and effort from the viewer. Yes, the Connelly character seemed convenient to carry plot points, and later, our emotions forward. Yes, a change of heart or two takes place for an emotional kick. Yes, good triumphs over most of the evil we are presented with. Welcome to the Hollywood blockbuster version of the world's strife and suffering.Almost 7 / 10!",7,1,2,5 April 2007
Invincible," The 'nicest' football movie you'll ever see!!
","This is a very entertaining, almost sweet movie, about the 'true story' of a local Philly fan who actually makes the Eagles squad in the mid-70s. This has the Disney stamp of wholesome and I found it to be refreshing. A football locker room or practice field can fill up with expletives, but I recall only one scene where a friend is excited that '...you made the freaking Eagles'. After being assaulted with 'realistic' movies, HBO's 'The Sopranos' or Showtime's 'The Brotherhood', the toned down language was a welcomed change.The performances are fine. Mark Wahlberg's typical laconic style is well suited and he certainly looks the part physically. Greg Kinnear toned down his usual smirky side, for a likable performance as well known good guy coach, Dick Vermeil. The female lead is pretty, perky and has a funny NY Giants alliance. The supporting friends and family are nothing new, but lend good humor and texture to the story. The direction is almost slow paced, which actually makes the jarringly exciting football scenes even more exciting. A nice touch was footage of the actual player and coach before the credits roll.A good rule of thumb for sport's movies is that a 'non'-football fan (or Eagles fan) could watch it and still enjoy it. I think it passes that test easily. All in all, a very entertaining, exciting, uplifting story -- suitable for the whole family.",8,1,1,25 August 2006
Mystic River," Great Acting - flawed presentation
","This film has generated many mixed emotions from its viewer, which in itself is very telling. In fact, I have very mixed emotions.  This was a gut-wrenching movie experience, with child molestation and the brutal murder of a loved one (especially a parent losing a child) as the hinges of the plot.  This is not computer generated kick boxing or hobbits' stuff.   The acting was uniformly amazing, but there were many plot points that chipped away at the movie's impact.  Overall, a good attempt at 'real' moviemaking, that has left me in search of the book,  to see who bears responsibility for : the badly explained murder motive, the out of place and illogical 'King of the Family' speech, the curious 'gun point' by the police man who had ignored an obvious murder and the silly, non-talking wife who calls regularly. Flawed screenwriting and editing aside, anyone who watched these performances and determined they were inferior or unworthy of their critical acclaim, has to point me to the movies and performances they are watching. And since I'm in a ranting mode, doesn't the Foreign  Press folks (Golden Globes) have it right.?  How do you compare Hoffman's 'Tootsie' to Kingsley's 'Gandi', or Bill Murray's excellent burnt out film star to Sean Penn's unrelenting anguish?  An extra category for thoughtful comedic turns (another i.e.-- Sean Penn's 'Sweet and Lowdown') would be fine with me.",Null,0,0,15 February 2004
The Departed," Riveting, mind-blowing, intense film making at its best!!!
","After the movie concluded (and it ended in about 4 parts), I practically slumped, exhausted, in my seat. After 2 1/2 hours, almost no one in the theater even stirred. It was an amazing, emotional experience. I felt like I had watched a season of 'Deadwood', 'The Shield' and '24'. Whew! Since 100's of people have reviewed the plot, I just needed to decompress by saying that the performances were uniformly amazing, right down to the most minute roles. Sensational casting, and Scorcese got them all to nail their performances. Nicholson is never over the top, just the right mix of menacing and zany. DeCaprio, who I felt struggled with 'Gangs of NY' and had nothing but crazy to fall back on in 'The Aviator', gives an electrifying performance here. He and Nickolson should start working on their acceptance speeches. Not to slight Matt Damon, who has the charismatic baddie role down perfectly. The film is so perfectly cast that I could go on and on (Walhberg & Baldwin had insanely cracking dialog), but must mention Vera Farmiga. If I've seen her before, I don't remember it, but her she handles a very difficult part with great style. She made the 'girlfriend' role interesting and meaningful. She was stylish and attractive, without the stunning 'movie star' look. Of all the players, she should come away with a huge career boast. So, a perfect movie? Pretty damn close. I could use a little less violence, but apparently Boston has its own 'Mean Streets'!!!!",9,0,2,12 October 2006
Music and Lyrics," Much better than I expected...... everyone's in top form!!
","This was one of those movies that eventually hits the queue on your online DVD service. I actually have enjoyed and have great affection for both the leads, but the promos didn't look great to me. Well, everyone involved in the movie was in top form. Hugh Grant put aside his recent run of cad-like roles and got his dry, incredible comic timing back in form. And with a musical flair that I never realized he had. Drew Barrymore has played the sweet, charming, slightly off-center, lovable everygirl about 5 times in a row. Apparently I can't get enough of it, cause she gets me every time. She is the most naturally likable actress working in movies today. The supporting cast is also terrific.The story has been written up a hundred times, so it isn't re-inventing the romantic comedy wheel. Boy meets girl ,falls for girl, loses girl...........! Just because we know its coming, doesn't mean it can't be entertaining and this is great entertainment. Tip of the hat to writer/director Marc Lawrance. The one-liners are funny, the music is silly, entertaining and actually, pretty listenable. There is a mild harpooning of the music industry, which adds to the fun, without being mean spirited. This was a fun surprise that I highly recommend to all fans of the stars and rom-coms in general. Oh, and check out the deleted scenes. Each one has a funny moment!",8,0,0,24 May 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Exciting, but nothing new here !!
","I cannot say I didn't enjoy the return of Bruce Willis and his indestructible NYPD cop - John McClane. The action scenes are well staged, the acting certainly on par with the better action thrillers (MI:, James Bond, etc.) and apparently many of the stunts involve real stunt work. I do not know which is which (real vs. CGI) as the line between actual human endurance and movie hero endurance has long since been removed. And that is one of the main reasons why these blockbuster action flicks have lost some appeal. How can I ever be on the 'edge of my seat' when the hero, and whoever is in his charge, avoid 2,000 - 3,000 bullets, flying cars, bombed apartments/vehicles, helicopter and jet attacks, collapsing bridges, self-inflicted gun shot wounds and my personal favorite.......the 100 foot fall. Yes, the fall is usually broken by 4 or 5 semi-soft items, but in this movie it happened to 4 different people!! OK, a bit unfair not to enter without complete suspension of belief. But it gets old to see the bad guys immediately shoot 20 -30 people without a word, then always have John and his troupe 'drop your gun and come with me'!! The movie has some good quips ('enough of this king foo sh--'), a fun comic turn by Kevin Smith and plenty of exciting effects, so still a 7/10 for me. A 1/2 hour less running time wouldn't have hurt (maybe less is more?). But with each passing blockbuster, the thrills are harder and harder to buy into.",7,1,3,23 July 2007
