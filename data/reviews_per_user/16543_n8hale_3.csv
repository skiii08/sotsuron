The Incredible Hulk," The Most Serious MCU Movie
","While this movie definitely ties in with the other MCU movies, it has always felt the most distant from the universe, and even on a rewatch I still feel that way. While most of the movies in this universe are action packed with a bit of humor, this movie takes itself very serious. My biggest complaints are the visual effects and the way the Hulk looks. His mouth is so weird looking! I also didn't care much for Liv Tyler's performance. This movie opens up a can of worms to things that are never answered, such as what ever happened to Betty in future Marvel films? I understand that this is only the 2nd MCU movie, so it makes complete sense that they didn't know for sure what direction they were going in yet. It's a fun movie, just pretty dated and the least like any other MCU movie. But at lease it's better than the 2003 movie!",6,0,0,6 May 2018
Source Code," The Source Code is AMAZING
","So Source Code... a great movie with the one and only... Jake Gyllenhaal! His performance in this movie was excellent(as usual). BUT I'll get to that in a second. MOVIE INFO The movie Source Code came out into theaters on April 1, 2011 and I actually saw it in the theaters. 'An action thriller centered on a soldier who wakes up in the body of an unknown man and discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train.' -imdb. This movie is rated PG-13 with a running time of one hour thirty-three minutes. Directed by Duncan Jones (Moon). Starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko), Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye), Vera Farminga (The Departed), and Jeffrey Wright (Casino Royale). REVIEW I really enjoyed this film! It had a mixture of thriller, sci-fi, mystery, and even a little bit of romance! (But if we be honest here, every film nowadays has a bit of romance). If you like the kind of movies that keep you on the edge of your seat because you just want to find out what the secret is, what the answer is to the mystery, then you will really enjoy this film! Jake Gyllenhaal plays Colter. He keeps waking up on the same train, and he only has eight minutes to stop a bomb that is on the train. So the whole entire movie he is searching for the bomb, and especially who is in charge of the bomb. That's where the whole 'edge of the seat' experience comes in. The whole movie you start guessing who is behind the problem, who is really in charge of the bomb that will be exploding. I myself had quite a few thoughts on who it could be, but of course I was wrong. It's a great story plot! Did it leave up to its expectations? Yes! Now the first time I saw this in the theaters I didn't like it as much, only because I had such high expectations for it and so I was expecting the next best movie! But after watching it almost two years after the release for the first time since then, I really enjoyed it! I'm always into a movie with Jake Gyllenhaal because I just think he is an amazing actor. He played his roll excellent. Think about it. It'd be hard to play someone waking up on a train, not even knowing who you are, and trying to stop a bomb you know nothing about! But he nailed the roll and, like always, delivered a great performance. Michelle Monaghan was also very good for her roll. It's not like she was so amazing that I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the roll, no. I could imagine several other actresses that would've also delivered good performances, but she was great! I really liked her character, Christina, too! *spoilers* When you finally got to find out who the person was that was behind the bomb attack on the train, I must honestly say I was sort of let down. It's not because of the fact that 'the guy who dropped his wallet' was the one, it was the way they presented it. Jake Gyllenhaal calls the guy's number and finds out it is him, and then____ nothing. He confronts the guy turns off the bomb and well that's the end. Everyone is saved. I just wish that when you find out who the person ended up being, they would've made it more dramatic. I wish Jones would've set the tone for that part. That is my only complaint. Overall Grade: B+ I give it a B+ because it was a great film and I really enjoyed it all, but just the way they showed the audience who the person was, wasn't enough for me. I felt that we've been waiting to see that part the whole movie, in fact ever since we saw the first trailer, and then when we actually did find out, it was just like 'oh. that guy...' I just wish it would've lead up to the mystery bad guy in a better, more dramatic way. I hope you all enjoyed this review! I recommend this movie big time! Thanks for reading!",8,1,3,1 February 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The movie is amazing!
","The movie is absolutely incredible! All the performances are amazing, especially James McAvoy's, Michael Fasbander's, and Jennifer Lawrence's. If you haven't seen any of the other X-Men movies, then I highly recommend checking them out before watching this one because you will appreciate Days of Future Past so much more. Not only is the movie the best in the X-Men saga, but it is also funny, suspenseful, gripping, and action-packed. I absolutely love the storyline in this film as well. One of my favorite scenes of this movie was Quicksilver's. Is there anyone who does not like the guy?! Because he is amazing! I just wish they could use the same actor for The Avengers Age of Ultron. Mystique, my favorite mutant, has a huge role and so that's amazing. In the final scene when Mystique is deciding whether to kill Trask or not, and the camera is switching between past and future: best part in my opinion. I loved how the movie plays slow music for the scene, it means so much in such little of a tune. I loved X-Men and I have already seen it twice! I don't plan at stopping at that either... 10/10 Stars! :)",10,3,4,26 May 2014
