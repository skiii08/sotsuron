Howl's Moving Castle," my best Ghibli work
","Sophie is a girl but becomes an old lady due to curse by a witch. Sophie meets Howl who is a magician. She starts to live with Howl in his moving castle. First, buildings, characters, and clothes are colorful and artistic. Simply, we enjoy just pictures. Soft color combination and depiction makes Grand worldview, I think. Story line and themes is difficult a little. Watching this a number of times help to digestion and give new a way of appreciating and messages. I like this movie the best in Ghibli works. First, Howl is so cool in that both appearance and inside. His personality is conceited but weakling. Though he looks sorry on the face of it, these bring his gentility and strength, I think. No matter how many times I watch is, I enjoy Howl's attraction and I think real theme of the movie.",9,1,2,26 July 2016

Then she tries to solve the problem, flesh-eating animals missing. Nick becomes Judy's partner for a strange reason.Judy's constructive way of living and attitude that she never gives up are. I think too brave character like her is particular to animation. Judy's challenges have an important massage like 'dreams come true'. Moreover multiracial society and multicultural society are reflected in establishment of many kinds animal.This is a just Disney animation film. There are cute characters so from children to adults can enjoy. Not only story line is fun, but also there are many messages. This movie gives me courage and hope.",8,1,4,26 July 2016
About Time," warm
","A young man, Tim becomes aware of his own ability of time slip and hears this ability has been handed down from generations. He use this ability for making his life and his family's life better, particular his own love. Through his time travel, he grows up.In spite of SF or time-travel style, this movie has love story and family story. Taking in time travel naturally, the theme of movie is wide, I think. The balance of parts of comedy and serious are good, so I can watch it with comfortable tempo.This movie is one of my favorite movie. I like a scene where Tim and his father have the last meeting and he can never to meet again. It moved me. This film told me how important 'now' is. It's so warm story.",10,1,1,26 July 2016
My Neighbor Totoro," darling characters
","Satsuki and Mei move to countryside with their father. This area has a wood, Totoro, a ghost or monster, stay there. Mei finds Totoro and they exchanges. Satsuki also find Totoro. Satsuki and Mei are helped by Totoro several times. This story is that the sisters' contacts with Totoro.What impressed me in this movie was that this movie doesn't many dialogue. On other hand, sound effects are various and cute, I think. Sounds of running Satsuki and jumping Totoro are cute and funny. These are effective in bringing out an attraction of the animated cartoon. Moreover, Mei's voice and portrayal are very cute and just a little child so darling.This movie released in 1988. After about 30 years, we can get friendly with Totoro and Totoro is famous and popular even now. I think the reason why this is so popular is simple development of story and charming characters. This movie made me happy and cheerful.",8,0,1,26 July 2016
