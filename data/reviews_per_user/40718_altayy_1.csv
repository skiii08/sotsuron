Requiem for a Dream," American Dream ,American Chaos
","This was maybe the most disappointing film I've ever seen,I found no reason to give 8.5 out of ten. I am trying to find a logical answer and came to the point that these are the black dreams of the American society and that's why people who live in the North America are touched so much. I could't find any directive satisfaction nor an acting superiority in the film. I usually test the taste of the films after I watch it;whether it broke my heart or activated anything in my schemata etc.,some kind of a psychoanalysis.I have warning for the people who live apart from the wild capitalist countries that they will find nearly nothing for themselves.And for the last thing: My sorrow for the people who live in the Middle East awakened again , The invasion of an ill minded country under the name of 'democracy' is so so unfair that sometimes I wonder who will take 'democracy' and social justice to the U.S. itself. I am so sorry for the earth and people who live on it.",1,2,7,28 August 2007
