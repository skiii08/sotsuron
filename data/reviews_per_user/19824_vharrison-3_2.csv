The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 'When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man I put away childish things' --- Paul the Apostle
","This is not your typical coming of age movie. It is transcendent and sincere and of special interest to those of us (especially the introspective and isolated among us) who remember moving forward from junior high to the new and strange place called high school. The story deals straightforwardly and honestly with the many personal issues we all experienced as children during those times, awkwardly developing into teenagers and adults. The pains and wonders of the process are extraordinarily examined in this wonderfully crafted film. The script is literate, the ensemble cast is excellent and the mood thoughtful and ultimately uplifting. It is one of the best of its genre and enthusiastically recommended.",9,0,1,15 February 2013

","Save your money and your time. Except that the CGI moments were great (but were better done in the new 'Cosmos' TV series and the film 'Gravity'), this film at nearly every level of filmmaking was boring. This certainly would be true if you have no interest whatsoever in science fiction or fact. I had problems enjoying this film on several levels: 1. The annoying musical score: Never seemed to fit the moment, bombastic. 2. The over-the-top soap opera-type melodrama: All characters it seemed carried an unlimited supply of angst and tears. 3. The irritation of trying to hear the actors mumble inane dialogue, especially Michael Caine. 4. Burning corn fields look like Iraq oil fields on fire. 5. After 23 years, the watch left on the bookshelf still ticking and evidently keeping time. 6. Chasing speeding drone through cornfield with a flat tire all with a smooth ride. 7. Hollywood 'Wild-west-type' mano-mano fist-fight between Damon & McConaughey in air tight space suits, through a worm hole on an ice planet in another galaxy far, far away. 8. Midway and unexplained appearance of the Topher Grace character. 9. Sets and props often looked like they were borrowed from ancient TV show 'Twlilight Zone' 10. Absolutely zilch on-screen chemistry among actors. 11. Poor Ellen Burstyn looking so artificial in all that heavy latex and make up.I quit, you get the picture of this picture. Awful!",1,15,29,21 November 2014
