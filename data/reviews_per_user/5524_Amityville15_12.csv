Gremlins," We're here...
","Don't ever get it wet. Keep it away from from bright light. And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much t begs...never feed it after midnight. With these instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his cuddly new pet. Billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for.This film starred: Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates & Hoyt Axton.Gremlins is hilariously scary and wickedly scary. If you haven't seen it already, you should watch it, Joe Dante did an excellent job in directing this film and so did Steven Spielberg did a great job in producing this film as well.***/***** Good film.",7,0,1,5 May 2014
The Ring," Before you die, you see...
","It begins as just another urban legend - the whispered tale of a nightmarish videotape that causes anyone who watches it to die seven days later. But when four teenagers all meet with mysterious deaths exactly one week after watching the tape, investigative reporter Rachel Keller tracks down the video and watches it. Now, the legend is coming true, the clock is ticking and Rachel has just seven days to find the answer and unravel the mystery before she becomes the new victim.This film starred: Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson & Brian Cox.The Ring is overrated in my opinion and is not scary whatsoever. I have no interest in seeing the sequel to this movie either. I was recommended this film by friends, they were saying it was terrifying and the scariest film ever made. So as you can gather I was really looking forward to watching this film and my expectations weren't lived. Not recommended. This isn't really a review, more of a RANT.**/***** Poor.",5,0,1,28 July 2014
Minority Report," A decent thrill-ride...
","For six years, Washington D.C. has been murder free thanks to astounding technology which is able to identify killers before they commit their crimes. But when the chief of the Precrime unit is himself accused of a future murder, he has just 36 hours to discover who set him up - or he will fall victim to the perfect system he helped create.This film starred: Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell & Max Von Sydow.Minority Report was released in 2002. This was an OK film in my opinion but it wasn't as good as what I had heard. I think this film is definitely overrated but I did enjoy it to a certain extent. It may have dragged on for a bit long. However this film did have very good special effects. So it was an OK action film but I don't think I would be interested in watching it again. I do recommend if you are a fan of Tom Cruise sci-fi movies.***/***** Could be worse.",6,0,0,1 December 2014
Training Day," An OK cop drama...
","On his first day on the job as a narcotics officer LA cop, Jake Hoyt is sent out on the streets with veteran detective Alonzo Harris for a day that will make or break him. Pass the test he becomes a detective. Fail, it's back to traffic duty. As Alonzo pushes his young charge to break rules and push lines, Jake's misgivings about his superior grow as he begins to suspect that Alonzo does not simply push the boundaries. He has become a rouge cop.This film starred: Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke & Eva Mendes.Training Day was released in 2001, and in my opinion is an OK movie, I did enjoy some aspects of this film but not all of it. I do think that Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington are great actors as they have both proved it in other films but I can't say I really enjoyed this film. I do recommend this film to people who are a fan of cop thrillers because they will enjoy this film, however I thought it was slow in some aspects and this is not a film that I would rush to watch again anytime soon.***/***** Could be worse.",6,0,1,19 October 2014
Full Metal Jacket," A good war movie...
","Joker, Animal Mother, Gomer, Eightball, Cowboy and more are all plunged into a boot-camp hell pitbulled by a leatherlung D.I. who views the would-be devil dogs as grunts, maggots or something else. However when Pyle suffers a mental breakdown after being beaten by fellow platoon members with bars of soap. He proceeds to kill Sgt. Hartman and then put his rifle in his mouth and kills himself.

After this Joker and Rafterman proceed to accompany the squad through the rest of their battle including a gun fight with a Vietnamese sniper who turns out to be a kid.This film starred: Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin & Lee Ermey.Full Metal Jacket was released in 1987 and in my opinion is a good war film. This film keeps you entertained throughout it's 2 hour duration time and this film also contains savage action and has some comedy dialogue. I do recommend this film because it will entertain you.***/***** Good film.",7,0,1,2 November 2014
Foxcatcher," Overrated...
","An Olympic gold medallist in wrestling Mark Shlutz joins the Foxcatcher team and teaches a bunch of people who hope to find the same success as him. He becomes close to the owner of Foxcatcher John E. DuPont. When one day their relationship comes to an abrupt end. DuPont appoints Mark's brother to take over. Things go from bad to worse for Mark and DuPont which could lead to DuPont taking serious actions.This film starred: Channing Tatum, Steve Carrell & Mark Ruffalo.FOXCATCHER was released in 2014. In my opinion this is an overrated film and was disappointing for what I was expecting. The most shocking thing about this film is when you get to the end and you realise that it was based on a true story which makes you think for a minute. However, this isn't a film I would watch again and I believe that you could do better things in 2 hours and 20 minutes that this film runs for. Not really recommended.***/***** Could be worse.",6,1,5,12 January 2015
The Evil Dead," The first and worst...
","5 friends travel up to a cabin in the middle in a deserted wood as they explore the basement, they find some things like a shotgun, a tape recorder and the book of the dead, when they play the tape recorder the accidentally listen to a spell that releases demons that eat the flesh and possess innocent people and tell them to join them and get them to kill their own.This film starred: Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss & Betsy Baker.The Evil Dead is the first from a trilogy and also has a remake that was released last year and out of the 4 films this is by far the worst one, it has some of the worst graphics ever known to man, people say this was made in 1982 and had a low-budget and I respect that but Jesus surely they can't be that bad, they must of had a budget of Â£5 just to buy the play dough that was used to make the demons when they start to corrode. Although I don't like this film I do recommend it as it has some god sequels and you don't just dive into the sequels without watching the original.**/***** Poor.",5,0,5,12 July 2014
Army of Darkness," Trapped in time, surrounded by evil...
","Bound in human flesh, inked in blood, and amazingly hard to pronounce, the ancient necronomicon, or Book of the Dead, unleashes unspeakable evil upon mankind in the final chapter of the Evil Dead trilogy.Back to do battle with the deadites, Ash is back, the handsome, shotgun- toting, chainsaw-armed department store clerk form S-Mart's housewares division. Demonic forces time-warp him and his '73 Oldsmobile into England's dark ages, where he romances a beauty and faces legions of un- dead beasts, including a ghastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the evil dead, rescue his new girlfriend and get back to his own time?This film starred: Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz & Marcus Gilbert.Army Of Darkness: Evil Dead 3 is my favourite film in The Evil Dead series because it's hilarious. It's not scary because it's too funny even the demons are funny. However my favourite scene is when there are 5 little Ash's running around and torturing him. Recommended highly.****/***** Very good.",7,2,3,20 July 2014
Heat," A Los Angeles crime saga...
","When a brilliant master thief and his group of professional bank robbers accidentally leave a clue to their next heist, they start to feel the heat from the LA police force.This film starred: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro & Val Kilmer.HEAT was released in 1995 and is a good cop thriller. First of all just like The Godfather trilogy, Scarface & Carlito's way Al Pacino is a fantastic in this film. Robert De Niro was also really good in this film. These are without saying two are the best actors in the business. Michael Mann also did well directing in this film. I do recommend this film because although slow in some scenes, HEAT is a good film overall, and when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino square off it is not to be missed. A great climax to a 2 hour 45 minute movie.***/***** Good film.",7,1,3,23 August 2014
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," The undead are among us...
","A vampire tells a reporter his life story, starting from when he became what he was when a vicious evil vampire cast his teeth into his neck.This film starred: Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst & Christian Slater.I found Interview with the Vampire boring and don't think it is as good as what people say and what this site rates it. However this is in my opinion. This film isn't terrible but I did find it boring and not as good as I thought it was going to be. Not really recommended unless you are a massive Vampire film.***/***** Could be worse.",6,0,1,4 August 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Absolutely terrible...
","5 friends go to a remote cabin in the woods for a break however they don't realise that they are all going to become sacrifices as they are being watched by a company and all five must die in a particular order to stop the gods who used to rule the Earth from coming back and ending the human race.This film starred: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth & Anna Hutchinson.The Cabin in the Woods was released in 2012. This film was so stupid it wasn't even funny. On this site it says that it is a comedy/horror. I don't think this film was trying to be funny, just the sheer stupidity of it made it laughable. If you are thinking about watching this film just save yourself the time and don't because it is such a let-down it is unbelievable. I don't recommend this film what so ever as it is one of the stupidest films I have ever seen.*/***** Awful.",3,3,5,24 December 2014
Evil Dead II," Dead by dawn...
","Ash, the sole survivor of THE EVIL DEAD, return to the same cabin in the same woods and again unleashes the forces of the dead. With his girlfriend possessed by demons and his body parts running amok, Ash is forced to single-handedly battle the legions of the damned as the most lethal and groovy hero in horror movie history.This film starred: Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry & Dan Hicks.Evil Dead 2 is more of a remake of the original than a sequel, it's much better than the first film and another thing I prefer in this film is a lot funnier, the first film was supposed to be as serious horror film but it was funny because it was so bad and this second one was funny because it was a funny film. I do recommend this film as it is better than the original.***/***** Good.",7,0,0,10 May 2014
