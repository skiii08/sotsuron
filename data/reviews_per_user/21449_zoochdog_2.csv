Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," action=awesome, movie=sucks ass
","lucas made kick-ass action scenes and a sucky-ass movie.dialogue and character development and exposition could have been done by a 1st year film school student. action sequences were a whole new level of excellence.there was also way too much comic relief. so much so that it felt like a kids movie in a way that the original trilogy did not. the original 3 films had an adult appeal that this movie did not.finally, how in gods name did lucas get such crappy performances out of actors generally regarded as talented. Portman, Jackson, McGregor, and Neeson are regarded as actors, not just movie stars. yet their performances sucked uniformly and for that I blame Lucas.see it cuz you have to. but don't go it expecting anything near the first 3 Star Wars movies.btw, Jar Jar Blinks wasn't as bad as everyone says. Remember that this is a children's movie, and you won't hate JJB as much as you would otherwise.",5,0,1,18 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," how could this happen?
","why didn't this win best picture? clearly it kicked ass and was a superior movie worthy of viewing again and again and again.if you've read LOTR, this movie kicks ass.if you haven't it's still a great flick.",10,1,1,18 August 2002
