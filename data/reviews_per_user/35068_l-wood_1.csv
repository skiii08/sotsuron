The Blair Witch Project," One of the worst films
","If anyone of you want to be scared go and watch Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street or In the Mouth of Madness.  The Blair Witch is a joke and is a great example of a movie that is over hyped.TO THE CREATORS: Come on guys, a two hour home video can put anyone to sleep and it did.I do not understand how critics can say this movie (not a film) is even scary.  Almost everyone sitting around me in the theater said that it had to be one of the worst films they had seen.TO THE CREATORS: Never leave the audience in suspense and never resolve it. BAD.I do tip my cap for the actual shooting of the film.Remember, this movie is not worth the price.  Go see Sammy get eaten by a shark.",Null,0,1,30 July 1999
