Marie Antoinette," One of the biggest disappointments I have ever seen...
","I am just outraged at how this movie that could have been an Oscar nominee turned out to be much more like a train wreckThe movie was exquisite with very good taste in what scenery and costumes are concerned and even some of the acting however this film is very far from great . It is true that the director wanted to accomplish a fresh new approach to a wonderful story like the Moulin rouge effect however I don't think that she accomplished this at all, lets face it , the music was vulgar and very out of place. The plot is shallow and has LOT'S of flaws and at the end it all just came out to this: She left Austria, she got married, she spend some money, she had some children, she got exiled, the end. No point and sadly no plot.I think most readers would agree with me that there must be a better way for a director to spend $40,000,000. I think I will give this movie 2 out of 10 for their efforts, mediocre yes, but not the worst ever seen.",2,2,2,22 October 2007
