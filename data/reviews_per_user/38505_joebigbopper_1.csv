Requiem for a Dream," drugs, yey!
","i have watched 1 and a half aronovsky films and one and a half gave me a headache. i don't think the word groundbreaking is appropriate. i watched most of requiem for a dream, i missed parts [for 2 reasons,1, i had a headache, 2, i was trying to make out] but just glimpsing at the screen every so often, a blind person could understand what was happening. granted, this film is visually stimulating. many of the techniques employed coming from music videos, other directors and a good editing suite but still i give it some credit in its effectiveness. but another film about drugs gives me a headache...how many have i seen over the past few years. i guess I'm bored by these kind of films. i have no interest in this material. trainspotting a few years ago is a very similar film. a film that also gives me a headache.fair enough if a film wants to be depressing but I'm sick of wasting my time looking at the downfall and deterioration of mcgregor, di caprio, leto etc. how about some real stories. something original that people can relate to. something that shows us how depressing your life can be without sticking a needle in your penis or a dildo up your tuppence. I'm sure there are a million better stories and subjects out there. they would be groundbreaking....",Null,0,1,31 August 2004
