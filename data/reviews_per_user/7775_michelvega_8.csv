Skyfall," No more interested in Bond
","I grew up with Bond, from Dr No to Die Another Day and will no doubt watch all the iterations again when shown on TV. This changed with Casino Royale. Gritty yes, like the everyday world around us. Bond was escape. Now no more humour, no more wit, no more charm. At the time of Quantum of Solace, I didn't even know there had been another Bond movie with Daniel Craig. I was surprised to see it on TV for the first time. It wasn't that good but it was somewhat entertaining the first time around. Then came Skyfall and it's nonsense scenario. I saw this in the theatre and wondered about the pointless action, the silly hacking, the plot holes... When it came on TV a few months back, I didn't even bother to watch it again. And I sure won't go for the upcoming Spectre. I agree that Bond had to be updated but Broccoli's new Bond is an ageing creep, a killing machine matching those he used to fight against in previous films.Rest in peace James Bond. You will be missed.",1,21,41,11 July 2015
Interstellar," Silly storyline
","Ho hum! The planet is dying. No more astronauts needed, farmers needed now, 'cause the crops are failing... What the heck will the farmers do in a dust bowl? It happened once and they went to L.A. So the astronaut turned farmer finds a secret NASA base next to his corn field. Turns out his daughter will grow up to be another Einstein. So, said astronaut-farmer goes out in outer space to save Mankind and fights with another astronaut on another world, and blah, blah, blah. Oh! And there's this black hole, really the star of the film, no pun intended, not to mention the many down to Earth holes in the plot. Very disappointing. On the plus side, the photography is nice. If you don't know anything about space, or about science, do go see it. It might blow your mind. If it gets people to care a bit more for the future, that's worth a passing grade in my opinion.",5,5,8,11 July 2015
The Transporter," An entertaining mix
","Yep! Truly a Luc Besson movie. A little bit of James Bond, a touch of Jackie Chan, Bruce Willis, Austin Powers, even Kill Bill in those intervals in fighting, though here bordering on tedious. A kind of sound track reminiscent of his other movies, I happen to like generally. Add a little touch of originality and shake well and voila: you got a totally ridiculous, preposterous and yet funny movie. The car chases were good and predictable. The rocket propelled grenades or missiles changing course in mid flight; if they were heat seeking, I keep wondering where the heat was coming from. A toaster perhaps or a coffee machine? This is not the kind of movie I would watch twice but what the hell. I saw it on TV and it was fun. I give it five stars for entertainment value. There are far, far worse movies in this genre out there.",5,0,0,17 July 2015
Ex Machina," The Greatest Mystery
","What makes our kind of intelligence? Will we ever create something intelligent? And more importantly, intelligent like us? And what is intelligence? How do you define it? Even the Turing Test would not work. Any program written to simulate artificial intelligence could also be made to fool the Turing Test, just like car pollution emissions tests. What about the soul? Do we have one? Do we need one to be intelligent? As we explore these questions, we either end up with simplistic answers or complete incomprehension of what we really are. Science boils down to philosophy, then back to science. Do we even have the mental tools to define ourselves without bias? Can the observer observe himself observing others? Can we go through the mirror, as Caleb claimed to have done in the movie? The truth is, as of now, we don't know where intelligence comes from. Does it come from our brain or with the development of our brain? Or is it out there in the quantum world, for instance, waiting to be accessed by our neurons? A kind of Wi-Fi brain. What makes us human is as much a mystery as the birth of Space-Time. ExMachina does bring an answer, a very human and simple answer to these questions. Duplicity, lies, the desire for freedom or sex, and the means to achieve our objectives exist in all animals and humans are just better at reaching them. If we ever create a machine that really can think, then we don't need to fret for long on how it will find a way out of any situation, because it will still be our kind of intelligence. We don't know any other or even if there are any other kind. Somehow, exceptional as this movie is, it is bound by our own intellectual limitations. When, and if AI is ever created, we may be surprised by the results. How will we know when AI has happened? When machines start telling us to take their job and shove it, or decide to start a rock band or go watch a ball game on a work day. Only then will we know they are us.",8,1,3,5 January 2016
The Wolverine," Very entertaining.
","I've never cared much for the X-Men movies, though I like many of the actors in them. That said, I found The Wolverine compelling and exciting. A beautiful red haired girl with a samuraï sword cutting up a red neck to pieces, literally; a sweet Japanese grand daughter and lots of ninjas and action. Reminded me of Elektra, which I love and Kill Bill, which I also love. And of course, Hugh Jackman who rules the roost after a well deserved bath and some manicure. He really makes it sound believable. Like others, I found the silver samuraï part silly. Was there really a need to delve into an Iron Man kind of opponent. But what the hell. Show me a man who wouldn't want to be immortal and strong with shiny throat slicing metal spikes coming from his fists. Would do wonder for any weakling self esteem, as far as I'm concerned. But that's what this kind of movies are there for. It releases the brave and courageous inside of each of us. That's what we like about such films. However too many mutants in a movie dilutes the fantasy for me. One is enough, like Elektra, Kiddo in KB and Wolverine. Much easier to root for one do gooder than too many of them. So now I'm waiting for another Wolverine movie. Well done!",8,1,2,29 December 2015
Lucy," Enjoyed every minutes of it.
","Of course the premise is wrong, though I couldn't think of a better way to move the story along. Much easier to say her mental ability has gone from 10 to 20 per cent of full potential than her IQ has gone to 10000 or so. Suffice it to say that I know high IQ people who didn't make much of their life anyway. There was one goof that the goof checkers seem to have missed. In the movie, the original Lucy is as tall as Scarlett Johansson. In reality, she would have been around a meter tall or about three feet. Story well done otherwise and entertaining. The bad guys are really bad and much deserved to get mowed down. Scarlett is impressive and fun to watch as she changes from an ordinary young woman to a tough no nonsense avenger. I liked the bullet in her shoulder idea. I wonder who got the idea of a bullet hitting her after ricocheting off a wall. Good thinking! Morgan Freeman has always the ability to sound credible, no mean feat considering his ridiculous lecture at the university. Fun movie with good action and pace. I only wish it would have gone on a bit longer somehow.",8,1,5,11 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Painfully dumb!
","This is not about making movies anymore, and certainly not about good story telling, or good acting, or anything good. This is all about HYPE, like the latest Bond movies, Star Trek, and whatever Hollywood is dishing out these days. Disney is nothing more than an attraction Park for kiddies and their parents who have to go along for the necessary photo albums. I won't repeat what has already been said, but yes the movie is awesome as a bottom feeder in cinema history. The one star I'm giving it is in compassion for the actors who tried their best to do something with the absence of a script. Sometimes, you can say ''it could have been better''... but not with this one. There is nothing in there for Rey to salvage. All junk not even worthy enough to feed yourself. I'm old enough to remember seeing the original Star Wars in a cinema, the joy and excitement I felt, nearly all of us science fiction fans felt at the time. Waiting in line to enter the cinema, it dawned on me that almost none of the people waiting were born in 1977. Such a pity there was nothing exciting to see or feel for them like we did then. Some have talked about nostalgia. But this thing is not about nostalgia, it's about harvesting the most money possible with hype and trailers and nothing else.Edit:Reading comments from others that did like the film so much that they feel compelled to defend it from us 'trolls', let me simply say that I can make my own mind on a movie, that I don't need someone to chew it up for me before I go see it or don't. I went in for SW7 with an open mind and a new hope for a really new dazzling SW. Instead, I saw a rehash of old SW movies, no originality whatsoever and really nothing worth sh*t. Some people characterized it as a reboot, or even a Tribute. Tributes are something we see on TV along with 65 car commercials we're usually not interested in. And after six SW movies and more than 30 years waiting, I was hoping for a trilogy that would out stellar the first one. If a number of people are willing to settle for that, for a vapid plot with a Sith Lord that can't control himself and Luke Skywalker stuck up a mountain because he decided he failed as a teacher of the Force, it's perfectly fine with me. Imagine if people on our own planet reacted the same after a failure in their life, there would not be a single mountain top left without a hermit. I didn't want a reboot or a tribute when I walked in the cinema, a wanted a new, I mean new SW, and that's not what I got, hence my acute disappointment and that of many, many others. One last thing, I liked Daisy Ridley as Rey and certainly hope to see her in other movies. I've got some good feelings about her.",1,81,132,3 January 2016
The Martian," Pure enjoyment
","This is a remake of a sort. The year was 1964. The film was Robinson Crusoe on Mars. We didn't know much about Mars then and there was still some fantasy that the atmosphere on the Red Planet would be thick enough for water to be found.The passage of time has made it a classic of the science fiction genre. Fifty years later, we'd think a remake would be atrocious by comparison, like it was for The Day the Earth Stood Still or War of the Worlds and many other classics of the fifties. But this is not so. The Martian is magnificent in all aspects. This time around, we know what Mars really looks like. Ridley Scott has it pinned down pretty well. No standing water. A thin, unbreathable atmosphere. The sun is farther away, thus less light at least for our human eyes. Lifeless world with a bluish-grey sky or orange tint as red oxidized dust fills the atmosphere. Put in a few dust devils and lightning in the distance and you are definitely there, on Mars. The lone Martian has to survive. His crew has left him for dead after an unlikely freak dust storm has forced them to take off. Had to happen for the movie to take off, so to speak. The rest is made of ingenious solutions to survive, not to mention ample use of duct tape. Really, don't ever leave Earth without it. Everything is kind of believable until the end. Of course, so many things would have to go right for the abandoned astronaut to survive that, in most likelihood, he would not. But this is science fiction. Matt Damon puts in a great performance as astronaut Mark Watney and the rest of the cast pitches in believably. I wasn't expecting the movie to be so hilariously funny at times, but it is. The Martian never felt long to me and was enjoyable to the end. The science aspects of it was top notch and made you believe that it could be done. Kudos for the writers. This is excellent work. All in all, the best new movie I've seen in many years.",10,3,9,4 November 2015
