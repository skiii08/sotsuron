Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," the force is strong in this one, but beware of the dark side
","Star wars episode i : the phantom menace. hands down the most anticipated movie of all time. when we found out in 1985 that George Lucas was planing a prequel triliogy to the most successful sci-fi saga of all time i am pretty sure that many reviewers started to find the best way to a say that this movie sucks and 14 years later. it comes down to bad acting, lame charcters. well guess what folks. this is not Lawrence of arabia that we are talking about. THIS IS STAR WARS. yes a kids flick. and if you go  in ready to tear up this movie then you will find a reason. but if you go in like i did like when i was 6 then you might actually enjoy it. regardless to many reviews i feel that Ewan Mcgregor gave a very good performace. considering what little footage of Alec Guiness as obi-wan he had to study. I felt that it represented the original trilogy very well. I also think this is an excelent starting point for the story of Anakin to begin. it also is early enough to not worry about Anakin's fate and to route for him in the pod racing scenes. so over I enjoyed this film and i can hardly wait for episode II.",Null,0,1,20 September 1999
