Sucker Punch," Intelligent and Beautiful, (not for everyone, though)
","Thru posters and advertising I was expecting a super hero kind of movie.During the first few minutes of the movie I started to feel disappointed. Seeing the main character so helpless was not what I was expecting.As the movie evolved, I realized this was imperially exciting. A series of events, under the eyes of a very strong willed, ingenious minded Baby Doll, the movie makes you travel to a world where almost everything is possible sending this strong message to its audience: We just have to put our minds to it to accomplish what we want. Very sad drama story which includes a very adult issue, displayed with a lot of taste and brilliance.Awesome scenery, beautiful fights, and characters. I loved the movie more and more and the story developed. Right at the end, I realized the movie was indeed about a hero.Zack Snyder has never disappointed me and this is simply put a master piece.",Null,14,29,22 June 2011
