Requiem for a Dream," His clapping days are over.
","I must be desensitized, because it did nothing for me.  And whatever residue was left over - it was from the story, not the direction.
Requiem was actually incredibly romanticized.  Idealistic.  People with their heads in the clouds, carefree and terrified to take on responsibilities.  Everybody was a victim.  Passive.  Sucking pity from their bad luck cows for all it was worth.  Pouty kids afraid of the real world.  Afraid of work. 'It's a b---- out there' I believe were the exact words.  Hey, it took you this long to figure that out?  This is new to you? You think the world owes you something?  Wake up and smell the system.
By the end, each character is impaled with cold, hard reality.  A metaphor for life always slapping the daydreaming escapist in the face.  And the movie ends and we are forced to mourn.  But grieve for what -- the four fools?  Babies in a world of wolves resistant in converting to maturity.
What did Aronofsky add to Requiem?  Just another MTV music video for the doper.  An organically motivated skip-fest interested in everything from the mundane to the outrageous.  But there is compassion - in all the mistakes and humiliation, a subtle glow of empathy haunts the film like a possessive ghost.  Requiem could have been creepy.  Perverted, disturbing and hard to watch.  But instead it had a relatively main-stream focus.  Pulling out before we couldn't handle it.  Leaving all the bad stuff to be insinuated. Moments of talent, but no limits were pushed.  But I suppose that is the practical approach, since all movies are so commercialized today that once a director finally breaks into the business, (s)he is terrified to gamble that safety for the sake of true cinematic exhilaration. And what exactly was so original?  The editing tricks?  That clichÃ© dock hallucination?  That Smashing Pumpkins video rip-off effect?  Pupils dilating?  That cult of geriatrics?  Intimate human drama impresses me. Flying pastries do not.",6,0,1,16 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," insanely complicated [the movie, not the review]
","From the scrolling yellow text at the start, to made-up names and languages used by the fantastic plastic aliens stuttering and mumbling through their lines, Phantom is a menace to society.Gifted technical specs outweigh classical training in visual composition. The screen is completely saturated with details, leaving no 'white space' to diffuse and compliment structured architecture.  You must understand, when a person looks at a 'scene' for several seconds [such as during a film], the eyeball naturally finds and gravitates to the most visually important object.  Such as Leonardo DaVinci's Last Supper -- we find Jesus and stare at him, even if we're Jewish and would rather choose not to.  Unfortunately in Phantom, the screen is decorated with thousands of layers of movement and color, completely disrespecting our chance within the several second allotment to focus on one spotlighted image, and saturate it into our mind.The beginning not only has chaotic dementia in exploding every possible idea that Lucas could have accumulated in the 22 years of not directing, but dialogue and placement of action is unbelievably hard to attach emotion to. Only when we get to Anakin does some human fork prick the sterilized intergalactic muscle of wars and stars.  The machines stop blocking the screen and we get the penetration of the hierarchy within the story line about Obi-Wan and Darth Vadar and such people.From there on it is quite optimistic, bright and imaginative; a happy candyland.  Beautiful places that ARE credible, for at some point you realize that you're watching 100% pure Star Wars, all done by the original creator.  Not a remake of Episode IV, but something fresh and new.  The spill-over concept about Vadar shouldn't surprise us, since Lucas had originally planned to make 9 movies.Yet the special effects were more believable in Episode IV.  And here we have goofy fluffy slap-stick (that was very hard to stomach).  We have Ewan McGregor's haircut (that was even harder to stomach).  Mechanized alien puppet faces with big lips that are only as charming as their remote control operators.  Venetian cities in flat CG and perfectly choreographed sections of digital birds added to frames that didn't seem full enough.  Overall it's a very child friendly affair, with token preschool-esque characters shoved in (to cover all demographics) in the form of everybody's favorite target practice -- Jar Jar Binks, or as my father calls him, that stupid horse.But despite it all, I like sci-fi and recommend Phantom.  It has its uses.",6,0,1,26 November 2001
Memento," otnemeM
","Surprise endings don't excuse complicated, explanatory meanderings.  The story is much more shrewd than the film makes it out to be -- things are still falling into place long after the credits have stopped rolling.Kind of slow, forcing you to give it a chance, since we presume to know the rest.  Through all the billowing sequences and finally settling for some lucid crime/detective/drug theme, at the end the surprises pop out and BOOM credits roll, but only after a very cocky, humorous Guy Pearce says with the utmost pretension 'Now, where was I?'  You can almost hear the filmmakers sneering into your ear 'Aren't we just so goddamn clever?'Yeah, you were clever...but not much else.5 Fight Club insinuations out of 10.",5,3,4,5 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Uh, no. [Possible spoiler.]
","Borrrrrrring.Lucas(s) doesn't know what he's doing anymore.  Clones plagiarizes at least 5 huge, famous blockbuster movies.  I've heard that the movie picks up after 40 minutes, but guess what IT DON'T.  Looking at Portman's solid torso we see George's age as he seems now to cast only for looks and no personality. She looks damn good, but there's something incredibly dead about her.Clones clunks along and is too easy.  And YODA kicking @$$ at the end is too much of a desperate attempt to please the losers who actually came to my screening with their light sabers.  [There just ain't no way that little gremlin midget can jump that high.]  Come on now.  I'm not an elitist prick Star Wars hater.  I LIKE the series...but a piece of crap is a piece of crap.Waste of my freaking money.",Null,0,0,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Kind of scary. [spoilers]
","Description: long narration, Renaissance fair, dialogue/action [repeat for 9 hours], a mountain, the end.  No problem with imagination.  But realize how not original it is.  The 'humble hero gets stuck saving the world' scenario with 'sidekicks.'  The 'come along for the adventure' vibe, with things I've been introduced to before.The FX are cheesy with a capital Gouda.  Overall it is somewhat lame, with too many uninteresting dialogue 'getting to know ya' starters, and not enough delving into those highly frightening suspense scenarios.  (Ratio would be 4:1 or less.)Nothing against the hobbits, but I thought there'd be more action.  Damn the trailer!",Null,0,0,22 December 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," What? No jet pack?
","The tragic thing is that they showed most of the best parts in advertisements.  I mean they literally took every decent scene and packaged it up and shipped it out to the recycle bin of commercial wasteland until we'd wake up in the middle of the night with the subliminally, surgically implanted fight scenes and the surprise concept that the ninjas are anti-gravitational.  Over and over with that drumming and some strange scene with the wisps of green trees sinking from the weight of Chow Yun Fat.  Sword fights.  Oscars.  Word of mouth.  Ang Lee here. Geisha runway fashions there.  All profitable concepts are pimped to the extreme.  And the mystery is gone. I saw the movie before I even saw the movie. But regarding the film, the story was just too childish for me.  Too bad I'm not Asian.  They're the only ones who seemed to like it.",Null,0,0,16 June 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Renoir on acid
","You know that hyperactive, burlesque trailer for Moulin Rouge?  Well uh, the whole movie's like that.  And when all is said and done, if you don't have at least some amount of respect for what Luhrmann tried/was trying to do, then you are officially a dinosaur of the cinematic progressive revolution. What we have here is the onset of the new 'Editing' era, to where digitization and special effects are invading the theater tenement like the asseverated pretension of color or the introduction of surround sound. It's a collagen enhancement to spoil us even further.  The fearless, continuous prostitution of the movie experience.Let's face the fact that the old new Hollywood of post-Vietnam is over; Kubrick is unfortunately dead, Spielberg has peaked, and Coppola is off making things like JACK (with Robin Williams; yes that was a Coppola production).  The 70's directing generation has reigned, and now let a new wave sweep through the forever changing Hollywood.  New ground needs to be broken, and the introduction of such cheeky fireballs like Moulin Rouge are needed to pioneer through the old and stale.  And if you're not with the movement, you're against it.Personally as a film, I thought Moulin Rouge was thin and obvious.  To me Nicole Kidman will always have the personality of a wet fish, and don't tell me that when Cameron eventually saw this, he didn't think for at least a minute that Baz was ever-so slightly plagiarizing his $1.8 billion baby. Yet I liked it anyway.  As a film, it was meager.But as a creative statement...it was spectacular spectacular.",Null,0,1,16 January 2002
The Mummy Returns," I want my Munny Returned. [No hard feelings.]
","Because no matter how sore my frontal intellect lobes were, or the sorry state of my insulted reasoning in forming realistic maniacism, you've gotta give it up to Stephen 'Indian' Sommers for pumping out an unbelievable success story.  His two Mummy movies put out as threateningly terrific marketeering ploys of sucking out America's millions under the front of an effervescent little action movie.Mummy 1 was incredibly fun, no matter how the more pompous of the deployed critic army had hailed otherwise.  It was a great resurrection of the light-hearted comedy farce centered around historical trumps from the same gene pool as Indiana Jones.  (Or else a determined remake justified through better available special-effects/face-lift technology.)  And it worked.  We had a laugh.  Universal made some money.  And life went on.But there is something fishy about Mummy 2.  A little TOO eager to please, this sequel.  More like a specifically precisioned beast of translucence based on randomly selected telephone surveys to anonymous people about what the studio needs to do to get a rise out of & get this potential movie goer to see this thing on opening day.  Obviously that Oded Fehr guy was a big hit with the ladies, since he had a bucketful of these Fabioesque, heartthrob man-meat promo shots for tall dark and handsome Arabian GQ. They porked it up with flashbacks of that ever-clichÃ© Ancient Egypt gold chantilly Renaissance paradise, as well as fight scenes with sci-fi creations of an obvious 3D computer-generated quality.It WAS pretty.  But it was also pretty confusing and pretty ugly in the IQ department.  You can almost see this thing being written for the theater reaction -- where swashbuckler searches in dank cave but finds nothing, then a loud boom accompanies the 'turn around and find ogre breathing down your back' scare tactic.  (Insert popcorn flying towards ceiling here.) Although, the Virilliant Vosloo not only looks believable as a 21st Century Boris Karloff, he's a good sport with stage directions that must have looked humiliating in real time AND he milked some sympathy out of the audience at the end by shedding a few trick tears...dare I say triple threat?  Dennis the Menace had at least some sort of listless command, and the end was on the brink of sheer excitement.But like a drunk girl, Mummy 2 was just too goddamn easy.  No sport in watching it take any chances...just another air-headed run around.",Null,0,0,8 October 2001
A Night at the Roxbury," brain damage from all that head bobbing
","Content.  No freakin' content.  A shallow concept stretched to the maximum. It tries TOO hard to be funny.  Technically, though, it's very good.  The lighting and overall direction -- standard Hollywood systematized unoriginality.  (Gee, what a surprise.)  But CONTENT was low.  Monotonously low.  Come on, now.  You can actually tell when they're trying to get a laugh.  You can actually freeze frame and pinpoint the exact moment when Chris Kattan is trying to do 'comedy.'  They're ugly and they can't act. Somebody scared these SNL guys because it seems like they were intimidated. It completely fails.  The movie is boring.For God's sake, Loni Anderson is in it.  Doesn't that just say it all...",Null,0,2,10 June 2001
