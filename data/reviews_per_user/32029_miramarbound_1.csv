Angels & Demons," Ron Howard what were you thinking
","I would vote lower but 1 was as low as they go. At least the Da Vinci code was close to the book. There were a few changes but the major points were held to. Angels and demons however is quite another story. I thought the book was a lot more action packed than the Da Vinci code and had so much more potential as a film. From the opening scene Ron Howard departed from the book and preceded to destroy it. The direction he took, he might as well have changed the title of the film since it no longer resembled the title it was supposed to be. I am sad since I was so excited when I heard of Angels and Demons being made into film and let down that changes were made that had no business being done.
