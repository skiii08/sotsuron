Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wow!
","Best movie of the last few years, thats for sure! Saw it tonight, and was almost on the floor laughing. I was gagging I was laughing so hard.My god. Go see it if you haven't. I can't imagine the type of person who wouldn't like it would be reading this right now...so you will like it. This movie is not for the faint hearted, nor people with no sense of humour. He goes far far overboard, but you forgive him, because he is Borat, and because deep within the pubic hairs, there is a message.If you are unintelligent, then perhaps the message will escape you (emperor's new clothes style :P)All Hail Borat!The cockroaches...look out for the cockroaches!!!!!!",9,4,9,30 November 2006
