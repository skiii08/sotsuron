United 93," Interesting Perspective
","The perspective I refer to is that of the air traffic controllers and managers, and how they slowly come to the realization of a large-scale attack. It highlights also how unprepared and uncoordinated the airport controllers, the FAA, the military, and the executive branch decision-makers were. To me it begs the question: Have we improved since then? Given Katrina, I'm skeptical.The depiction of the interaction between the terrorists and passengers was believable and brought out how horrible the experience must have been. Small nits: given the violent maneuvering of the plane I would have thought there'd be injuries caused from being tossed about inside the cabin, and also lots of vomiting - I didn't see anyone vomit. The passengers seemed more concerned about saving themselves, rather than preventing another attack, and I'm happy the producers did not try to depict otherwise. They were ordinary people, not soldiers fighting for a cause. This doesn't diminish their heroism, it makes it real.",7,0,1,8 September 2006
