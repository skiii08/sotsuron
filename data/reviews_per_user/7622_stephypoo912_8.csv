Casablanca," Casablanca Pt. II
","This was my second time seeing Casablanca, but this time I saw it to the fullest. It was a good movie! It had a lot of hidden details in it that could have been missed. The fact that everyone and everything is not what it seems to be was one of the messages. Also, doing the right thing and the best thing is not always the easiest thing to do. Which makes a lot of sense when the audience actually pays attention and thinks about that moral. The black and white aspect didn't bother once. The film was set to make a person believe that their imagination got the better of them and the film was in color. It was very interesting, to say the least. Casablanca is a film I'd recommend to another person, for sure!",Null,1,2,13 March 2013
Chinatown," Chinatown in L.A.
","Another Crime/Thriller/Action movie? I'm in. Jack Nicholson isn't my favorite actor, but he did a good job in this film. The whole investigator themed story is interesting. It did take me a minute to get into the film, only because of the choice of actors, but as soon as I was well aware of what was going on, I had to recap and make sure I knew just EXACTLY what was going on. The camera work helped a lot, as well, once I understood the meaning of it all. The pan, the tilts, and the tracking really emphasized the film's meaning of the scenes and gave me a clear understanding of the shot. The ending on the other hand, if I could pick a different ending for the film, I would. The ending left the audience guessing and wanting more!",Null,0,1,11 May 2013
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","The photography of this movie and the concept of this movie is highly unique. The movie starts on a set that one could only think of being in a Snowglobe. Then after it goes off onto the life of a reporter, to say the least. Then the Life of a millionaire, and then the fall and crash of a man's life. With all this being the same person. The story is told beautifully about why he does the things that he does. And it goes to show that a man with everything can have nothing at all, at the very same time. Great Concept. The way Orson Welles has this story portrayed is very different. But his style in how he does all his movies, are reassured that they are incorporated in this film. The illusions and metaphors are incorporated in this film, but are made remarkable by the help of Gregg Toland.",10,1,2,26 March 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," The Great Grapes of Wrath
",What an amazing film. Not much more can be said about the movie. I am an addict to when it comes to The Great Depression. I am in love with the history about it. To know that this movie was based on the family problems during that time mad it so much more interesting to watch. This was a great film and I'd watch it over and over again. The storyline to this film was beautiful. The focus on the main characters made the vision of the director and writers' thoughts so much more vivid. The way the camera-work was highly intriguing. The black and white aspect of it made no difference for the simple fact that history was being told instead of watching a movie/being entertained by a film. Masterpiece.,Null,0,1,11 May 2013
The Graduate," The Graduate
","I like this film. Even after seeing it three times! Seeing it every time, I have different feelings towards this film. Any way, i still end up liking it and loving the ending. It is a film that is predictable in some ways, but in others it definitely isn't. The whole movie, in itself is great. The editing is a great way to start the break-down. One of my favorite shots is the triple take in the beginning half of the movie. Another editing part that ALWAYS catches my eye is the pool shot then the hotel shot. The way it merges as one scene into the next is NOTHING like I have ever seen before. That definitely kept me enticed. The story line as well kept me watching it. The way it ended made me think, 'Could there possibly be another way they could have found each other?' Hmm...",7,0,0,10 May 2013

","I am not a fan of musicals, but I must say that this movie definitely changed my mind about that. It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film. A great classic to just sit down and watch with others who also like musicals.",8,0,2,10 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," My Pulp Fiction
","My parents would always talk about this particular film as if it was something religious. Not just them, but other elderly people I know. Finally sitting down and watching the film, it's easy to see why they did that! Tarantino, CLEARLY, has been a genius since the 1990's. This movie is overwhelmingly powerful. Something I'll watch again. Not only did they have some amazing actors, but the whole plot was something to consider! Thee Crime/Thriller genre is something that interests me, so watching this was a breeze. The fact that it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole entire movie also had me consider its ranking in great movies. This is definitely a movie to get wrapped up in.",Null,1,3,11 May 2013
Psycho," Psycho
","My first time watching this movie was in high school. We were learning how to become a film critic. So in order to become a film critic, we needed to learn about the history of films. Psycho was a film that we needed to know the history of. Not being a fan of scary movies, watching this over and over again never gets old. The fact that this film was such a success to Hitchcock's life makes it a better watch. Also the fact that this is the film that all other films, including horror films, make reference to this very movie. The references stem from the music that plays, the scenes that were made, and the shots that were created. This film is the godfather of all horror films, to say the least. The history behind this film makes it a phenomenal film. Seeing the new released film Hitchcock, about the making of the movie with the leading star Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, has the original Psycho make so much more sense to those who haven't had the opportunity to study the history of this film. Both movies, recommended see.",9,0,0,26 March 2013
