The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A surprisingly engaging film
","It doesn't sound like a promising title but it turns out that it's a surprisingly engaging and charming film. The film occasionally lapses into narration which is probably the only minor irritation. I understand that the original book of the same name use a letter writing device and I suspect that the film makers were rather too fond of the idea. The three central characters play their characters very well and deserve the cabinet full of awards they have won between them. Emma Watson, being the best know, probably has a harder job but pulls it off with the aplomb of a true professional. It's nice to see the gay character of Patrick (Ezra Miller) being portrayed in a positive light and challenging issues of mental health and suicide being handled in a direct but sensitive way. A quality production definitely worth multiple views.",8,1,3,1 June 2016
Passengers," Fantastic film - Drama, romance, suspense, scifi ...
","I'd never heard of this film until I stumbled across it on Netflix. My loss! This is a beautifully woven story set in deep space.There's nothing overdone, just a beautiful symphony of parts coming together to make a fantastic whole. There are few things that break you out of the reality created for you by the director Morten Tyldum.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together, ably supported by Lawrence Fishburne, and Martin Sheen, in a rather surprising guise.This film leaves its mark on you and is well worth rewatching.",8,0,0,2 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Marvel Franchise Fun
","Don't expect anything groundbreaking in this movie but it's really great fun. It's the usual Marvel franchise stuff. Lots of violence, lots of action and lots of humour. The humour is a welcome break from the fairly incessant violence and that's my main criticism - too much violence and not enough story line. There was a good message about inclusiveness which is woven through the film. Some good performances from Ryan Reynolds, Zazie Beetz, Karan Soni and Kiwi newbie Julian Dennison.",7,0,3,19 May 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Too much and not enough at the same time
","I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly. At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before. I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.",4,266,647,11 May 2018
Black Panther," Excellent - A Fresh Take on the Marvel Franchise
","Has to be the best film I've seen for several months - perhaps a year. Let's be honest this isn't a classic of the magnitude of 'Gone with the Wind' or 'Citizen Kane' BUT it's good fun, fast paced, well acted, well filmed, well edited. I love that the two token white people were not American but British. It's refreshing to have a film which paints Africa in a positive light and where Africans - at least African Americans - are the focus. Well done!",8,2,8,15 March 2018
