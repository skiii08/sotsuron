Requiem for a Dream," Gripping, intense, the BEST film of all TIME!
","I recently took the adventure of viewing this masterpiece.  I was drawn to it for I had loved Pi and was drawn to it even more when I read its review in the sunday paper.  It was given four stars.   This film was absolutely amazing.  An hour and 42 minute film about addiction in which the characters undergo an extreme cycle of hardships caused by their addiction to heroin, diet pills and television. This film is a masterpiece of film techniques.  Almost every camera trick is used to make you feel as though you are in the bodies of the addicts. Even the soundtrack of the film helps to set the mood. <DARREN ARONOFSKY HAS DONE IT AGAIN>",10,0,0,10 December 2000
Evil Dead II," Hilarious gore packed horror/comedy!
","Extremely funny, a complete opposite version of the original Evil Dead which also a good gore packed horror film.  Bruce Campbell does some crazy stuff and basically everything that can go wrong and does happens to him.  In the end you sort of feel sorry for him but you will still be laughing.  A part remake/ part sequel of Evil Dead.  If you enjoy comedy and needless violence like me than you will love this masterpiece of a flick!!!",10,0,0,5 September 1999
