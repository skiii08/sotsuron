The Legend of Bagger Vance," A good and well made movie
","I dont like golf at all, to be more honest i suppose i should say that i really dislike it. But despite that fact, and the fact that the main line in this film was about golf, i must say that this was a very good movie. In particular i think that the photograpy as well as the environment used was very well made, and it looked very realistic and had a nice scenery.I also believe that the actors were quite excellent, all of them did a very good job, i guess i even should admit that Will Smith is a good actor after all.What i didn't like, well, maybe a bit too much golf, but i liked the story anyway, and not to forget, the way the story was told.",7,0,1,26 October 2001
