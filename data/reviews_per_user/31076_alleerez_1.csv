The Lobster," NO ENDING???????
","Ok it is a good premise, acting, directing, and I wanted to give this a 7 BUT IT IS SO SLOW it really could've been such an interesting eerie comedy suspense but instead it is like 2 separate films it is so long and then it just ends and you don't know what happened so you invest all that time for no conclusion?
Eh. Glad I watched it I guess but very frustrating end.",4,1,4,22 April 2020
