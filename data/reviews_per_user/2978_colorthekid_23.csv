The Perks of Being a Wallflower," 'We accept the love we think we deserve.'

Hereditary," Build Tension. Cut To A Wide.
","Nontraditional horror at its best, and that's on period.The fact that Toni Colette wasn't even nominated for anything really pisses me off, but what can you do.",9,0,2,10 November 2019
Us," US.
","Oh, I get it! 'Cause, like, America.And gosh, give the dude who scores Peele's films an Oscar already.",6,0,1,24 May 2019

Superbad," Booksmart (2007)
","From all the Booksmart ripoffs I've seen, this is clearly one of the better ones.",7,3,4,14 July 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," An Unique Super-Hero Movie.
","This movie is great. The voice acting is excellent, the plot is just fine, and the animation is out of this world. It's definitely this movie's biggest strength.What hurt the movie the most was its 'trendy' soundtrack, or rather, when it was being played. Whenever the movie tried to make us care about whatever was happening by playing some emotional 'trendy' music, my mind'd go 'Yeah, that seems forced.'All that said, Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is the most unique super-hero movie I've ever seen and that's mostly thanks to its incredible stylized 'comic-like' animation.",8,1,2,23 February 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Ramona! Ramooooona!
","This film made me realize that I have this incredible ability of falling in love with fictional characters in the first 30 seconds they're on screenLike, Jesus Christ, Ramona Flowers is the ultimate crush.And also, the soundtrack is absolute fire!",9,1,2,2 February 2020
Climax," A Great 'Feel-Bad' Movie.
","Love it or hate it, this film is technically astonishing and whatever it's trying to do, it's doing it very well. It's almost like they've trapped the true essence of French Extremism, set it on fire, and followed it with a steady cam.The camera work in this is surreal and its movements, along with the actors' choreography, are surprisingly well coordinated for a 'write-as-we-go' film.Climax will make you feel a lot of things and I don't think you're going to like how most of those things feel, but that's exactly what makes Climax a very well executed horrifying experience.",8,36,63,18 February 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's Love Letter To Hollywood.
","There's so many things that I absolutely love about this film. The performances, the writing, and how absurd some moments are, really do leave an impressionYou can tell that this film was made by somebody who has been watching films since they were a kid, and their love and respect for this art form is very present throughout the whole thing.It's not flawless, it's quite long, but it's a great Tarantino film, and one that I'll have fun rewatching.",8,0,2,28 December 2019
Get Out," Jordan Peele Done Did It.
",This film is really scary.I almost crapped my pants when dude pulled out a windows phone. Now that's some horror s**t.,8,3,6,10 November 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Oh Timmy, You Got Me Questioning My S**t.
",Masterful filmmaking. Masterful writing. Career-defining acting. Fire soundtrack.Masterpiece.,10,3,6,10 November 2019
Midsommar," Best Break Up Movie Ever.
","Midsommar manages to be bright and heavenly while also being gruesome and hellish. Like, there's some shots in this that I will simply never be able to get off my mind.I do have some issues with it regarding plot and dialog, but apart from that, Midsommar is one of the most beautiful and memorable films I've ever seen.",8,2,4,10 November 2019
La La Land," It's Great, Shut Up.
","What?I love musicals and this one's great, leave me alone.",9,1,2,11 May 2020
The Witch," A Disturbing Period Piece.
","By conventional horror standards, The Witch will fail to meet your expectations pretty much completely, but in exchange it will give you something far more special.A film that defies convention, a horror that does not scream for you to be startled, and a telling of a tale that so well encapsulates a time - a period - and its beliefs and fears.",8,1,1,10 November 2019
Joker," I Mean, It's Good.
","Alright, I think I overhyped this a little bit, and - you know what - that's totally on me.Joker is a good film but I wasn't really impressed by anything other than Joaquin Phoenix. His performance pretty much overshadows any other aspect of the film for me.It's well shot, it's well put together, but having seen it, I was left with the impression that it could've been a masterpiece in the hands of a better director-with a better script.I have some issues with the plot, and there were some specific things that were clearly thrown in there to try to please a certain type of audience, but at the end of the day, Joker is a good film. Just not the masterpiece I was hoping for.But gosh, I'm so glad the film is doing well. Joaquin Phoenix is one of my favorite actors and I love that he's getting the attention and recognition he deserves.",7,0,1,10 November 2019
Whiplash," An Intense Masterpiece.
",I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the only movie about Jazz Drumming you actually have to watch.,10,0,0,20 January 2019
Parasite," On Point!
","I'm going to put it simply: There's not a single thing this film does wrong.The comedy is on point. The drama is on point. The moments of tension are on point. The commentary on social class is on point. Acting, writing, filmmaking - on point.Parasite totally deserved the Palme D'Or and I want this to win all the Oscars, all the Golden Globes, and any other awards it gets nominated for because everything in this s**t was incredibly on point.Parasite is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE.",10,20,32,10 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An Astonishing Satire.
","This is probably one of the most creative and technically astonishing drama-comedies ever made.I can't write a proper review because, honestly, I'm too lazy and I can't seem to label this film.",9,2,2,23 May 2019
Iron Man," Not As Great As I Remember, But Still Fun.
","Robert Downey Jr. is good in this, but I kind of forgot how good Jeff Bridges' performance was. You can really tell he's an experienced actor. I probably didn't even notice it when I first watched it, not only because I was a kid, but also because I had no idea what good acting looked like, and Disney Channel was my go-to for entertainment, so I don't really blame myself.Re-Watching Iron Man now, after years of watching some pretty great films, made me realize that it's definitely not as great as I thought it was, but still an overall enjoyable fun movie.",6,2,3,28 April 2019
Mother!," Anxiety: The Movie.
","The way it's shot, how the dialog is written, the characters and their choices, all odd and nonsensical at first, but all there for a reason. All there to help write a poem that wants to tell you something. Some things. Everything.Mother! is an astonishing yet nerve-racking allegorical picture that won't leave your mind.",8,4,7,7 October 2019
Her," Simply A Masterpiece.
","'It was exciting to see her grow. Both of us grow and change together. But, you know, that's also the hard part. Growing without growing apart.'Her is simply a masterpiece.",10,0,0,7 April 2019
