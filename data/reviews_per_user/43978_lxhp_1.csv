Requiem for a Dream," An amazing sound score, as well as acting combined with the most interesting camera techniques.
","A great film to study from.The camera techniques used in the movie are some of the most complex and creative ones I have ever had a chance to see.The acting definetly doesn't bring the film down in any way or another, and if it were to, it is happilly blured by the terrifuc soundscore used to intensify all the ups and downs.Though the movie can be somewhat vulgar at times, the full emotional effect you'll recieve when the film roles, will totally allow you to accept any sort of morbid, drug infested, sexually deplicit... .. . I'll stop there.This is definitely not a film to miss, if you are looking into new camera techniques, this film can show you a lot.peace",8,1,2,27 January 2002
