Deja Vu," Don't ever miss this movie!
","At first I don't expect anything big really. I thought this was another action bang bang bang movie. but apparently, there is a good mix of humor, romance blended inside. This movie is awesome because it keeps your mind working, and I must tell you that you will need to analyze the story to enjoy the movie. This is an intense movie, because while you are busy guessing, the actions keep unfolding, and you will never be able to guess how it ends. With big names such as Tony Scott and Denzel, no one can't go wrong. Don't you ever miss this movie. I myself will surely collect one copy of its DVD. THe movie will keep you jumping out of your seat and even makes you want to draw the gun and shoot the villain yourself. Very very engaging and intense. Two thumbs up!",10,2,4,20 December 2006
Dead Poets Society," Greatest Movie I'd ever Seen
","You watch this movie, your life will never be the same. You will become a different person, who tries to fight your way to achieve your dreams! Don't die before watching this movie!! You'll realize that any dreams and goals is possible, after watching this movie. That you can break away from stupid systems in your environment!! I mean it! Carpe diem, seize the day! I love the character of the teacher, who inspires his students to be 'free in mind' and be themselves. Unlike the current educational system that limit students' spirit and creativity, crazy teacher like him should be promoted more!!! I wish I could be one of the students, and experience the unique methods of teaching. Too bad I don't have a copy of the DVD, gotta have one, soon!!",10,4,6,26 April 2006
Wanted," Totally forgettable
","I was glad that I did not spend a dime to watch this movie. A friend of mine treated me to cinema. What a terribly awful movie. Horribly non-sense background. There are only two good things about this movie, the cool red Dodge Viper that Jolie drives, and the spectacular scene of the train collapsing on the rail bridge over a huge cliff beneath the icy mountain. Other than that, totally rubbish.This movie made Spiderman or Superman, or even Hancock look like star movies, because not only they deliver somewhat more realistic world and 'realistic' superhero abilities, but also because these other movies outshine Wanted in every imaginable way. At least Spiderman, Superman, and Hancock still obey law of physics and gravity, and no they can't mind-control movement of bullets, and they got hurt too, and did not get heal fast, unlike the 'magic healing wax' that instantly out of nowhere could cure the hero in a blink of eyes in this movie.Well, enough said. Why waste my energy on writing more in-depth review. Only one advise for you who haven't watched this movie : avoid it. It would upset you, rather than entertain you.",1,18,32,18 July 2008
War of the Worlds," The worst story ever told!!
","special effect is great, advanced, astonishing!!!sophisticated. but the story is soooooo awful, the worst! how could Tom Cruise accept a scenario like that! How could his son reach his mother's home so easily, while Tom Cruise must fight all the awful and evil aliens ?? How could the alien machine lose their shield so suddenly ?? The serial story is much better, with better and more 'rational' way of solving the problem. THe movie can be better if the story goes into second or third sequel, like THe Lord OF The Rings. THey should have not jammed the story into one movie only. to sum it all, the movie is only a show of advanced special effect. If you're looking for great visual effect, go for this, but don't expect good story. Expect awful one..! Yeah, Tom!",1,0,1,26 April 2006
