Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lives up to its title, depending on how long you spent in line.
","This film is probably the most anticipated one in a long time, because its production was inevitable ever since the original trilogy became so popular. Some people have been waiting for its release ever since Lucas announced the trilogy of prequels was underway.  Unfortunately, this much time of anticipation means many people may have gotten their hopes raised a little too high.  Don't get me wrong--this film definitely works as far as the 'Star Wars' movies go, but just not quite as well as the earlier films did. I hesitate to say this is the 'worst' film of them, because I did like it, and I liked all the others.  It's just that each of the other three were better, though not by too much.  Not having ever had to wait for the release of one of the original films, I don't know how different they would have seemed to me if I did.  But this film did have its share of flaws.There were moments in the film that seemed put there for no other purpose than to get applause from the audience, though it may have seemed that way partly because it did get applause.  There didn't seem to really be a point to having a cameo appearance by Jabba the Hutt, for example.  Also, apparently someone couldn't resist the temptation to make 'I have a bad feeling about this' one of the first lines in the film.  Perhaps that will get it out of their system for the remainder of the trilogy.  Another thing is that in this film, some of the action sequences seemed a little too segregated from the rest of the movie, as if it were a video game.  When some action sequences started, instead of just letting it happen, it practically spelled it out for you before starting, as if they didn't give the audience enough credit.  At one point in the film, Anakin Skywalker is told to hide somewhere safe, so he chooses the cockpit of a fighter.  As if that's not obvious enough, Obi-Wan tells him whatever he does, stay in that cockpit, and there is a brief pause so people can figure out where this is leading, as if we couldn't tell.  But the lightsaber duel definitely lived up to those scenes in the first films, with the twist of having it be a three-way fight, between Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Darth Maul (Peter Serafinowicz), and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson).Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson both do excellent jobs in their roles. McGregor faces the challenge of living up to the standards Alec Guinness left him, but I've always thought he was a good actor, and he does the job well.  Anakin Skywalker is played by Jake Lloyd, who's about a nine-year-old.  I tried to suspend a little disbelief for his sake, since this is his first role in a movie, and nobody is expecting him to be the best actor in the film, but there were moments where it was just too distracting because he'd say something that sounded like no more than a line-reading, and he seemed to have no emotion behind what he was saying. Hopefully it won't be as big of a problem in the next film.  Darth Maul, this film's equivalent of Darth Vader, manages to strike at least almost as much terror as Vader did.  He doesn't have many lines in the film, but it is made up for in the fight scenes, when he shows off his speed.The film draws many equivalents to 'A New Hope', with George Lucas back in the director's chair.  There is a similar ending sequence, with the heroes standing before everyone and a celebration taking place.  The climax consists of a lightsaber duel, a space battle, and a ground battle, sort of like the climax of 'Return of the Jedi'.  It was almost as good a final battle scene, but didn't last as long.  It is one thing that may have been a little disappointing to the people who have been eagerly awaiting the film for so long, because some might have been expecting it to dwarf all the other films' climaxes, but was as good a battle as those in the other films. Despite the fact that this is the film to follow the largest gap between release dates of the 'Star Wars' films, the first film shouldn't be expected to be the greatest of them all anyway, because it is largely exposition for those people seeing it before any of the other films, but it does a good enough job to be Episode 1 of a 6 part (maybe more) saga.  Like 'A New Hope' this starts out with a lot of exposition instead of just plunging into battle as in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi', but because this film is at least almost as good as 'A New Hope', I have a feeling Episode 2 will be even better, as was 'The Empire Strikes Back'.",8,1,2,19 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," ...and the trilogy is finished with yet another great film.
","After 'Star Wars: A New Hope' redefined science fiction, and 'The Empire Strikes Back' redefined 'Star Wars', it's hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job.  The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what's going on in the war.  There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion's final confrontation with the Emperor.  When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion.  This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader.  It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn't seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them.  There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of 'The Empire Strikes Back', but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well.  With the light tone of 'A New Hope' and the more sinnister tone of 'The Empire Strikes Back', this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale.  The Special Edition for 'Return of the Jedi' concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it.  Fifteen years of technology advancements didn't seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac's mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense.  Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba's palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn't really end a story this big the way it deserved.  It's hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it's all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film.  A THIRD must-see for film fans.",10,78,109,12 January 1999
Scream 2," A good sequel, but not to outshine the original (what sequel does?)
","'Scream 2' is pretty good when compared to the original, which many sequels aren't, but like the man says, sequels are by definition inferior films, so at least this one wasn't THAT inferior. In this film, a series of copycat murders are happening around Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the new killer starts coming after her and the other Woodsboro survivors. One thing I missed while watching this was the occasional laugh from the first one. This one had a couple of good lines, but 'Scream' was definitely funnier, making fun of its own kind of movie. The funniest part in either film still remains as the moment in 'Scream' when the killer is coming up behind Randy (JAMIE Kennedy) as he watches 'Halloween' and says 'Jamie, look behind you!' (referring to Jamie Lee Curtis). The acting in this film is not quite as good as it was in the original, but wasn't bad. Dewey (David Arquette) had a couple of moments of overdoing it, but not too many. The main problem with the film was the 'who's the killer' mystery.  There are more suspects to deal with, and the filmmakers seemed worried that if the killer's character is developed too much before revealing that they are the killer, then people will figure it out prematurely. As a result, when the killer is revealed, perhaps you didn't see it coming, but you aren't really shocked that this person could be a killer because you don't really know much of anything about them. One thing you start to learn during the movie is that just because someone was involved in the first ordeal, it doesn't mean that they aren't a possible suspect now, nor does it necessarily mean they aren't a potential victim.  Depending on how suspicious you are of people, there are countless numbers of suspects in the film, and to a really on-guard person, just about anyone in the movie is a suspect, which makes it really hard to identify the killer.  There was one thing I didn't like about the movie, and one character was murdered who I still think should have survived. I really can't see from here how they are planning to make 'Scream 3' after this film seemed to burn the bridge to another sequel. It isn't necessary, seeing as how the same characters (mainly Sidney) have gone through the same type of ordeal twice, which is just on the edge of plausibility.  Maybe it's just so they can call it a 'trilogy', but it really wouldn't be, because there really is a difference between a trilogy and a film with two sequels. In general, one sequel is enough and maybe pushing it, and a second sequel is almost always too far.  'Scream 2' is still scary, and may even be as scary as the first, although the opening scene of 'Scream' is still the scariest of it all. This sequel doesn't make the same mistake many sequels to good films make, which is abandoning suspense altogether when it is too busy going all out with what it may have held back on in the first film, which in this case would have been as much gruesome death as possible. While it does have this extra gore (obviously it's going to -- this is a horror movie, after all) it still manages to have the same suspense that made the first one terrifying. If you loved the first film, you'll probably like this one too. This is still a good movie, but the first one, as always, was the best.",9,0,0,17 January 1999
Scream," 'Scream' defines horror films of its generation
","'Scream' is a film that did for horror films what 'Star Wars' did for science fiction: it re-awakened the horror genre.  In the 1970's, when horror films stopped being made well, people stopped taking horror films seriously for the most part.  Predictable slasher films generated fairly strong followings, such as the 'Friday the 13th' and 'Halloween' films. When that general string of films died out in the late 80's, these films were still watched, mostly when people wanted a good laugh, the way people watch 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' (Most commonly believed to be the worst movie ever made.)  Now, in the late '90's, with the advantages of modern special effects and blood that doesn't have the texture of Kool-Aid, horror movies are being taken seriously, and are being well-made instead of just pumped out every five minutes, and 'Scream' is the one movie that started this up.  Writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven do brilliant jobs of making the film interesting, even BETWEEN death scenes, a concept that completely escaped the makers of the '70's and '80's slasher flicks, which went no further than scenes of sexuality in those cases.  One element that made 'Scream' so brilliant was the strategy the filmmakers used to get around the standard-cliched-situation problem.  Instead of trying to disguise the fact that a certain scene had been done numerous times before in countless horror movies and was predictable for anyone who has seen any of them, they took another approach.  They explained these cliches used in older horror movies before or while they were supposedly happening, making the scene funny when you hear about how lame they are, and scary when you realize they are actually happening to the characters.  Although the movie was good all the way through, the best part of the movie is the opening scene, especially the first time watching it.  This is because it starts out with a seemingly harmless phone call from a seemingly harmless person which lasts long enough for you to get the feeling of tranquility, until the voice on the other line says something you didn't expect, and catches you, as well as the person he's talking to, completely off guard, and the only reason you don't wonder if you heard correctly is the fact that you know you're watching a horror movie.  Although that line was in the trailer I had seen many times before seeing this film, I still got the chills when it came. The 'slasher flick' idea is also combined with the idea of standard mystery movies, which is that everybody's a suspect.  This really goes well with the slasher idea, and I believe this is the first ever film that has these two ideas paired together.  Other films, of course, followed using this same idea, such as 'Urban Legend' (1998), but just know that 'Scream' was the first.  There is also very good acting in the film, and the main characters all have very distinct personalities which are portrayed very nicely by the individual actors.  My personal favorite is teenage film expert Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), probably because he was so much like me it's freaky.  Neve Campbell does an excellent performance in the leading role of Sydney Prescott, the primary target of the killer.  Other very notable performances include over-the-top Stuart Macher (Matthew Lillard), dweeby Deputy 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette), obnoxious reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), and token main suspect Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich).  No matter what you think will happen next and who you think will eventually turn out to be the killer, there is always one more surprise waiting, and a definitely unpredictable ending.  Scream makes a great film to watch alone in the dark, or in the broad daylight if you are the kind who just can't handle it.  A must-see for horror fans.",10,0,0,28 December 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The movie that changed the standards of film-making forever.
","Before the mid 1970's, special visual effects weren't really made to look as real as life, because it was just commonly accepted that it was not possible, so what are you going to do.  In 1975, 'Jaws' was a film with better special effects overall than anyone had seen before, and when 'Star Wars' was released two years later, it took these latest advancements of special effects into space, where it would change the way people looked at special effects.  Obviously it wasn't exactly as real as it would look if it were actually happening, and it may have had some noticeable flaws, but it did take the first step towards the realistic special effects we see today. If not for 'Star Wars', people would have continued using the special effects that were just enough to give you the gist of what was supposedly happening.  Because of the fact that these effects, though cutting-edge at the time, would be dated now, the 'Special Edition' was released in 1997 in order to maintain its impressiveness, with updated special effects that are as impressive by today's standards as the originals were in 1977.  Although some people thought the story itself was pretty corny, I think it appealed to people with open minds.  After all, that has always been the basic purpose of science fiction.  The 'force' is the reason for the most part that some people feel this way, but I don't think it is as 'out there' as some people do.  One thing the force can supposedly be made to do is telekinesis, which has obviously been thought of before because there's a word for it.  Not that anyone really takes the force seriously in real life, but I doubt anyone can go out and prove conclusively that it doesn't exist in any form, so it doesn't suspend THAT much disbelief.  There is some really good acting in the film, such as Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), but I believe the most notable performance is Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  Vader is one of not very many movie villains that has been remembered for so long, and he is one that can really scare an audience with his presence.  John Williams' music for him does a good job of representing how ruthless he is, although the famous 'Imperial March' wasn't introduced until 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980).  'Star Wars', although it was the first to be released in the series, is actually part four of a six chapter saga.  The reason this was the first film to be released is because it is really the only one that starts out in such a way that you can get away with not already knowing the story so far, and also has a happy ending with relatively few loose ends. It was because writer/director George Lucas was not sure how well it would do in the box-office or if he'd be allowed by 20th Century Fox to complete the trilogy since it was new ground for filmmaking that he made this decision.  He did, however, leave enough loose ends that could be expanded into the rest of his already conceived saga just in case the film was as successful as his friend Steven Spielberg was confident it would be.  As it turned out, despite the setback of having a pretty small budget, it was more successful than Lucas imagined.  I don't understand the fact that so many people are obsessed with every little detail of 'Star Wars' and know every little trivial fact about these films, nor do I with all the 'Star Trek' fans, but I did think the movie was great, as well as the movies that followed it.  It's too bad that a science fiction movie this spectacular will never win an academy award (or be nominated, for that matter) for 'best picture', but it seems no science fiction or horror film ever will just because too many people consider such films automatically unworthy just because of its genre (especially horror), but if ever a science fiction film deserved one, it would be 'Star Wars: A New Hope'.  If you're someone who doesn't like science fiction, then this film might not make much of an impression on you but if you are one of the few sci-fi fans who hasn't seen this film, then although you may have missed it in the theater where it was much more amazing than it could be on video, you'd better see this film, then the others if you want to know what science fiction has been all about all these years.",10,0,0,7 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," This film is no less spectacular than 'A New Hope'
","Of all the movies that have had follow-ups to the original, many just had sequels made only because the first was successful enough for it.  First thing to know: 'The Empire Strikes Back' is NOT a sequel.  A standard 'sequel' is simply the same or similar characters from one movie put in the same or similar situation to the one of the original movie, which is complete without any sequel (Jurassic Park, Speed).  'The Empire Strikes Back' was pre-planned, and while 'Star Wars' did seem like a complete story by itself, that was a result of creator George Lucas' uncertainty of whether or not they'd be given the opportunity to complete his saga of stories. 'The Empire Strikes Back' did an excellent job as the film following 'Star Wars: A New Hope', because it strived toward the same excellence the first one achieved, while the mood of this chapter contrasted that of the first entirely.  The first one definitely had a lighter sort of mood to it, as far as the action among the rebels.  This film concentrates more on the war itself, and how tough it is on the rebellion.  It also has more establishment of the imperials and their ruthlessness, which definitely adds a darker tone to it.  Score composer John Williams helps give this feeling to the film, with the now famous Imperial March that is so closely associated with villain Darth Vader (James Earl Jones).  For a mood this dark, there sure is a lot of really nice scenery in the film, from the glaciers of the planet Hoth to the spanning cloudscape of Bespin.  The special effects remain as amazing as those in 'A New Hope', and have been re-done with a 'Special Edition' as well as the first one, although not as much has changed in this film.  The acting is also just as good as it was in the first one, with the addition of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).  The emotion of this film definitely surpasses those in 'A New Hope', with the characters' personalities and relationships explored more deeply, such as between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and even Luke (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader, who for the first time have an actual face-to-face confrontation with each other in the unforgettable lightsaber duel.  This film is even more suspenseful and action-packed, with an incredible climax and other very high points as well. Of all the intense and breathtaking aspects of this film, the one that everyone has remembered since, and will be remembered for as long as 'Star Wars' itself, is the revelation by Vader to Luke, which most people already know by now.  If you are one of the very few who don't, don't do anything until you see this film (and the first one, too) and find out from the movie, not from some loud-mouthed friend, the way many of us did.  As hard as it would be to make a film as great as 'A New Hope' after it changed the standards of filmmaking forever, this film definitely meets and surpasses the first one.  It will also leave you hanging for the trilogy's final film, 'Return of the Jedi' (1983), which also does not disappoint in any way.  A SECOND must-see for science fiction fans, or movie fans in general.",10,0,0,12 January 1999
