The Avengers," Just what I expected
","This movie was incredibly charming and exhibits some of the finest acting that I have seen in a good while, Robert Downey Jr. is flat out amazing as Iron man. This movie is exactly what you would expect it to be, prepare for high adrenaline and the crowd laughing a lot more than they should about the decent jokes throughout the movie. I enjoyed watching it, but it does occur to me that the blatant lack of a plot takes it down a few notches in my eye. What these people did was create a movie that was just perfect for the American public, clever but not smart, shallow, and just the right amount of repetitive one-liners to get my fellow movie-goers going. Very exciting movie, however it felt like over an hour and a half of fighting and puns.",8,2,8,29 May 2012
