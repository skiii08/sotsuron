The New World," The Bad Film
","Listen, I am going to tell you a story. Oh, look, a flock of birds. Oh, a sunset. Now where was I. Oh, yes, a story. One about missed expectations, incredible durations, chopped and incoherent editing, stone-cold acting. Oh, look, Jonathan Pryce. Oh, look, tall grass. Oh, look, the back of someone's neck. Now where was I. Oh, yes, I was just saying that this film doesn't go anywhere, while trying and failing to attain too many goals. It loses itself into the worst editing job I have ever seen, and goes on for hours... Hey, did you just see this spider. Look, some mossy bark. Hey, a close-up on a flower. Where was I again. Oh yes, Colin Farrell still is undoubtedly one of the worst actors ever, not providing us with a single glimpse of what 'emotion' means in such a long film. There's probably but two different facial expressions displayed during over two hours of film. Hey, look, another sunset. Did you just see that tree? Where was I. Historical inaccuracies and anachronisms galore, the filmmakers, although they proudly announce at the beginning of the film that it is set in 1607, do not take account of this a single minute. Hey look, tall grass. Oh, look, a woman's face in close-up. Hey, look at the clouds while we try to make you confused a little bit more. One example: Mozart (lifetime 1756-1791). Okay, his music is heard several times throughout the film, a music that has been written for emotions and feelings felt more than 150 years later. Colin Farrell's body is covered with tattoos, which make absolutely no sense since he was a colonist, and it is yet another element that breaks one viewer's good intentions of focusing on the film, and on believing in the filmmakers' good will. Did I say that James Horner's soundtrack is nothing else than a few blokes making the same three notes and the same loud sounds with horns for two hours? Hey, look, yet again some tall grass. Hey, look, Colin Farrell has an earring, cause he's such a cool 1607 colonist. Hey, look, all of them have ultra-brite teeth, and we swear to god, it IS 1607! They just had toothpaste back then, didn't you know? But hey, look at some grass while they're still looking for a decent screenplay. Ah, too bad, they didn't find one. They're just going to do some pretentious voice-overs to make it look like a Jean-Luc Godard or a Marguerite Duras film, whoa, all they had to do is tell the story of Pocahontas, maybe it wasn't as easy as it sounds (yeah right), but why did they think Godard-style voice-overs would have brought the film any interest? Oh, wow, look at that spider. Are you still thinking it's a bad film? Now just take another look at that sunset then. It's the title of the film for Pete's sake, 'The New World', that's what you came here to see, so it has to have sunsets right? You didn't come here to see 'The Good Film' or 'The Intense Acting' or 'The Screenplay with Words in it' or 'The Director Who Actually Directs and Doesn't Think He's Hot S#!&'. Now did you just see this amazingly tall grass? TALL GRASS! I REPEAT: TALL GRASS FOR ANYONE TO SEE, AT THE CINEMAS AROUND THE WORLD, FOR JUST A FEW DOLLARS. Wow. 'Mother, who am I?' say the voice-overs. 'Mother, what is love'. 'Mother, what time is it?' 'Mother, why the hell did I accept to be part of that pretentious and empty film?' Hey look, a pink flamingo. The special effects are also amazing: the special effects guys successfully erased the National Geographic watermark from each frame of the film. I'm sure Colin Farrell's x-rated video was better-acted than this. Oh, here comes Christian Batman, here to save Pocahontas from Cap'n Crunch with his long hair. Hey, look, natives depicted as if they used to look and behave like animals. Absurd and insulting. Hey, look, absolutely no respect whatsoever for anyone in the cinema. Or for anyone whose life-story is being narrated on screen. Hey, look, a flock of birds, but not the same birds, new birds! 'Mother, why did I pay 5 euros to go see that film?', oh no, that wasn't one of the voice-overs, that was me, sorry. At a crucial moment of the film, Pocahontas says 'I'm sorry'. Look at that. Amazingly blank dialogs all throughout, totally dull and pointless. 'Mother, what is this film about? -Aflock of birds my dear'. Oh, look, the 1607 man that's so evolved and cool is chewing on grass, so cool. Oh, Batman and Pocahontas have a baby now. Hey look, it rains again, marvelous, stupefying, the people who made this film so respect their audience. Oh, look, a music piece by Wagner (lifetime 1813-1883), grand isn't it, how music travels back in time. Maybe Mallick's next film will be about cavemen and prehistorical romance between a tattooed Colin Farrell with bright teeth and a flock of birds. Music by Eminem cause it's so cool and accurate ya know. But I wouldn't say Colin Farrell has that much of an acting range to play a caveman. I tried to write this review in the same way T. Mallick directed his film. Hope it helped anyone realize how confuse it is, how remotely cinematographic it is... there's better to do than watch this. Go see 'Mission' again. Or 'The Last of the Mohicans'. Beautiful films. Forget Mallick.",2,3,10,11 April 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," The Chronicles of Phoney: lame visuals, no ideas, no rhythm.
","Here's yet another awful set of (badly) moving images from Diss-ney.Actors: they don't act. It's shocking how little dramatic direction they got, how flat and emotionless their acting is. Main reason that will make you forget the film 10 minutes after you're out: they just can't act. The kids weren't even cast to look alike (they're supposed to be siblings!). Tilda Swinton, very fine actress most of the time, shouts and acts with grandioso gestures as if she thinks she's in a Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter scale epic... which it isn't. Director: he doesn't direct either. You'd think there would be interesting camera angles, intelligent editing, mysterious travelings into the forest? No. The cinematography is awful, brightness always makes everything so obvious and plain that all sense of mystery disappears instantly, the sets are almost over-lit sometimes. The camera surely remained locked on its tripod during the whole shoot. It does move a tiny bit during a sleigh chase sequence, only sequence in which something really happens ('happen' might not be the word), and it instantly qualifies as the worst chase sequence in the history of cinema. The action is reduced to some running scared, never gets any better. Even the 'war' scene (yes, I know, there aren't supposed to be 'war scenes' in films for kids... don't ask me) is disgustingly still and heavily-directed. Wardrobe design: absolutely horribly disgusting design, the ugliest and stupidest designs for clothes I've seen in long. Whenever the actors wore a different outfit, I could barely restrain myself from laughing because it was even stupider than the previous one. Hence the Witch with her 'ice' hat, hilarious it's so ugly.Computer graphics: the worst I've ever seen. The beavers look like two obese humans, the fox looks like anything BUT a fox, and the LION... oh my, the lion is the worst piece of computer graphics I have ever seen in my life. Anything animatronic would have looked more realistic than this, a man in a lion suit would look more realistic than what they did here, hell, they should even have used a real lion, but this lion is absolutely rotten computer graphics, and makes Godzilla look like a masterpiece of realism and good taste. But you know, nowadays, everything HAS to be computer graphics, n'est-ce pas? Even if it's the phoniest visuals ever seen, they're still going to do it and not question themselves a single second. The plot: I haven't read the books, I have no interest in religion, Christianity or paganism, and yet when in a kid's film Santa Claus shows up distributing magic whistles, swords, potions and what not, I really can't help wondering why I paid to be watching a film with such stupid ideas. Or maybe the film's target is kids who are yet to be taught that consumerism and bigotry are not the only two ways to see the world. It doesn't go anywhere. The Witch can freeze people, but Aslan can make them live again. You can be wounded, but the magic juice heals your wound instantly. The lion dies, yet the magic stone table gives him his life back. It's not going a-ny-where. Production design: as cheap and uninventive as the rest of the visuals. The snow looks fake, every supposedly 'cold' area depicted in the film is blatantly shot on a sound-stage (they don't even try to add some steam, mist, or anything, when someone talks in the middle of the snow-filled forest, the girls don't sneeze while all they're wearing is stockings and a skirt, etc). Nothing in the atmosphere of the film remotely compares to such fantasy masterpieces as 'Legend' (dwarves & unicorns) or 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' (little girl lost far from home in fantasy world), which were made long before computer graphics and with a lot less money. But with plenty ideas. Make up effects: bad bad bad bad bad. Once again, totally uninventive, very very cheap-looking, ugly to look at. Just plain ugly. Cohesion: a lion with no lips saying the word 'past'. Kids living during World War II who need to fight on horses and with swords to defeat a Witch surrounded by cyclops (why don't they just go out of the closet and go get a good old tommy gun somewhere to get rid of the filthy stinky one-legged scum?). There is NO cohesion. But maybe that's from the books themselves.To sum up, I'd just say 'phoney'. Phoney acting, phoney snow, phoney computer graphics, phoney animals, phoney everything, this is the state of the art of phoney. Even if it was made-for-TV, or straight to video, it would be a phoney TV movie. When the film was over and the atrocious song started to play (awful song, really), I hadn't felt like I went on a trip anywhere, I just felt like I was stuck at the bottom of a closet for two hours, talk about escaping! Some people say that the film has a Christian content. The only message I could 'read' through the film was that 'inside the closet' was better than 'out'. I'd love to know if it's a Christian message as well?It is very important that I say that the gratuitous violence, the various occurrences of plain hatred, resent, graphic violence or bodily harm and purposeless humiliation or torture towards friendly characters of the story make this film highly unsuitable for kids under 15 or 16. Disney and the rating associations probably had to work hand-in-hand to get a PG, but the kids that cried and sobbed in the theater when I went and saw the film, I'm sure they didn't hear that.",1,7,15,5 May 2006
The Prestige," No-go
","Anyone with taste shouldn't attend a film with either Jackman, Johansson, or Bale, or directed by Nolan. Anyone with a brain would have seen the end coming an hour before the end comes. Chopped-up editing. Confused narration. Historically inaccurate. Very long. Boring cinematography. Studio movie 100 percent. Something has to blow up every 5 minutes to please the audience. The makers don't know if they're directing fiction or historical period piece. Maybe the only thing to save from the film is Bowie, walking through the screen like an alien-life form, with the same distinctive walk we have seen so many times in films (Twin Peaks, the Man Who Fell to earth, ...). David Lynch once wanted to make a film about Nikola Tesla, and Nolan asking Bowie to be him is maybe a nod to the project, but sadly it fails to portray anyone, or anything, in a convincing manner...And all this looks like it's been done and seen before a thousand times.",1,20,59,19 November 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," The Labyrinth of Del Toro
","Guillermo Del Toro shows an incredible amount of passion for his job. In interviews, in festivals, it is undeniable that this man adores making films, from one end of the creative process to another, and has tremendous energy and honesty for the activity. Nevertheless, there is something that doesn't function in his films, and as heartbreaking as it is to see someone with ideas and talent fail, this film isn't an exception and has a few weak points as well as his other ones. For some reasons explained further, it isn't even a 'true' fantasy film. I have to stress upon how wonderful and magnificent the imagery - not just of this film but of all his films - is. Man-like creatures, caves, labyrinths, statues, puzzles, everything that contributed over the years to make Del Toro's imagery makes him a very powerful visual director, which times like these are in desperate lack of. The visions he projects onto the screen make him no less than a visionary. The thing that fails to give his film(s) the grandeur they need, though, seems to be always the same element: character depth / psychological analysis of his characters / the way the characters and their personalities blend into the rest of the film. Maybe we can attribute it to Del Toro having more patience to polish the sequences with special effects than the ones with actors, but in particular in this film, the characters seem to have no depth at all, they are grounded to feel one emotion at a time. Ofelia in the film is shown owning and reading books, but her relation to these books, what they mean to her, what they bring her, this relation is never shown or explained, we have to go by a stereotype and 'assume' for ourselves that she has a wild imagination. The mother of Ofelia is also a faulty character of the story, we the audience have to fill a gap, and imagine for ourselves why shy would be attracted by Vidal, what brings her to be forced to stay with a monster like Vidal as opposed to remaining a single mother, etc... Vidal himself is very quickly presented: we know his lineage was military and that his father let him have his watch... not much of an emotional background for a man who tortures and kills with no hesitation! We know nothing of Vidal as a child, we only have this one-dimension, Manichean character. The list goes on, and none of the characters - Mercedes and Pablo, the doctor, etc, are presented or explained to the viewer. The same could be said about the elements of the illusory world. Usually, though, fantasy/horror films don't need any explanations (see Edward Scissorhands, Alien, Legend...), but this one would need to have some, and this is probably due to the state of psychological confusion of the characters (or, should I say, their irrationality). Ofelia, throughout the film, seems to live in constant fear of the tyrant Vidal, yet finds enough time and solace to go on imaginary journeys at night, and light-heartedly do anything the faun asks her, without even questioning or wondering where it will lead her. Mercedes, when given the opportunity to gut Vidal and be finished with him, leaves him alive half-way. And the doctor itself, whose side on the events is never clear, never poisons Vidal or puts himself in the way when given opportunities. Is Guillermo Del Toro cold? We might wonder. He has absolutely no scruples when he tries to shock the audience with violence towards nice characters, with monsters, with blood. Yet when his overall goal is to make a fantasy film, he remains a little bit too polite and shy to really break into the genre. To me, a 'real' fantasy film would have had the imaginary break in the 'reality'. Yet Vidal doesn't see the faun, the faun doesn't save anyone or scares Vidal. Reality remains reality and fantasy remains inside the heads. The imaginary world in itself seemed a bit poor because of that, because of the film not really being a fantasy film, keeping the fantasy inside the head of its protagonist and reducing the spectrum of illusions (which are never directly opposed to the 'realist' world). Overall, the film shows great academicism, not just by politely keeping the imaginary and the reality separated, but also by the decisions of the film-makers (the editing is gentle when it should be a bit punchier, the camera moves are scarce, the music is incredibly lame and boring, the camera angles are overall inexistent, etc).I have no idea whether Del Toro will or will not provide better character depth and psychological progression in his next films, but it flaws the films he has made so far. Yes, there is a beautiful message, we've heard it before, of how monsters can be monsters on the inside and humans on the outside, while some monsters look like monsters and aren't all that bad after all. But until the characters and the story have a real depth and meaning to the audience, none of all the fantasy, violence or special effects will mean anything. The blunt reality as it is shown here, carries so much depression in it that the message of poetic escapism doesn't function in the end. The task is difficult to propel kids in wartime eras, it is even more difficult when fantasy takes part in it. Del Toro's next films will, hopefully, dig deeper into its characters.",8,24,42,19 November 2006
