First Man," Haven't seen it, but the entire cast seems terribly miscast!
","So far as I can see of the actors I am familiar with (most of them), unless they have undergone a lot of makeup and facial remodeling or rubber-masking for their roles, I see virtually NO resemblance to the real people they portray of any of the male cast - other than having a mouth, nose and two eyes. This applies most appallingly to Ryan Gosling as Neal Armstrong.",3,0,8,10 November 2018
World War Z," Inexcusable aircraft discrepancy, C-130 vs AN-12.
","The visible differences between the Lockheed C-130 and Antonov AN-12 are so pronounced, I can't believe the director released this film with the scenes frequently cutting between the two aircraft. The airplane played such a prominent role in the movie, this simply should have never happened. The movie was virtually unwatchable for me because of this jarring discrepancy. Even people generally oblivious to aircraft types can tell they are not the same model of plane.I hope that Brad Pitt had not seen this gross error before the movie was released. That aside, simply the fact that this was a zombie movie should have given Pitt some doubts about his participation in the movie.",1,1,3,5 March 2016
