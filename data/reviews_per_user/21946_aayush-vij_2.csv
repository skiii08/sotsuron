Skyfall," Bo(r)nd Again!
","2012 marks the 50th anniversary of 'Dr. No', the film which first marked the appearance of the iconic MI6 agent James Bond. Six actors and 23 films later, Bond still remains a cultural icon across the world and from Connery to Craig, almost every film has been a treat to watch. So does Sam Mendes''Skyfall' fall in that category? Hell yes it does! And it successfully wipes our memory of the disappointing 'Quantum Of Solace' which I was sincerely hoping was not the last appearance of Bond due to MGM's troubles that followed.The film begins with a thrilling chase sequence in Istanbul (which, I believe has been shot to death in action films this year after 'Taken 2' and 'Ek Tha Tiger') which involves Bond (Daniel Craig) and field agent Eve (Naomie Harris)in pursuit of a mercenary who has stolen a hard drive which contains the information on undercover MI6 agents. When an accident following a fight upon a train happens, Bond is presumed to be dead. Soon after, M (Dame Judi Dench) is politely asked to retire by the Intelligence Committee chairman, Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes). However, M is forced to confront her past after an attack on the MI6 headquarters in London brings Bond back in action. What follows after is a roller coaster ride of a film,anything of which to be given away would be a crime. Speaking of the cast, Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are top-notch and have possibly given their best shot at it as their respective characters. Naomie Harris and Ralph Fiennes do their jobs adequately. Another wonderful addition to the cast is Ben Whishaw, who portrays 'Q' in a rather different and an interesting way than what we have seen of the character in previous films. But the standout performer who steals (rather,sweeps!) the film away is Javier Bardem as the film's main antagonist, the cyberterrorist Silva. He is perfect in every scene, perfectly creepy, perfectly menacing, never under or overdoing anything. In fact, I'll go as far as to say that his performance is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Heath Ledger's Joker in 'The Dark Knight'.Technically, this is a flawless film with every action sequence making it worth a re-watch. The score is astounding and Adele's 'Let the Sky Fall' from the opening credits sequence is very easy on the ears. Also, this one has possibly the best opening credits sequence in Bond history from a visual perspective. But the film has it's flaws as well,minor, but flaws nevertheless. The final act is somewhat underwhelming and does not match the awesomeness of the first two. Fans of the Roger Moore/Sean Connery era may not like the film, because there aren't really many scenes involving quintessential Bond elements. However,Mendes does make sure to feature those along with presenting a gritty, realistic 007. This film is probably the first one to touch upon Bond's past and how he came to be. More importantly, it addresses the question 'Is James Bond relevant in today's age, or is he a relic of the past?' Find that out for yourself. Do NOT miss 'Skyfall'!",9,6,15,10 November 2012
Taken 2," Turkish Thrill
","Four years after 'Taken' became an unexpected blockbuster and turned Liam Neeson into an action star overnight, Luc Besson returns to write the sequel, helmed by Olivier Megaton this time. 'Taken 2' has Neeson reprising his role as Bryan Mills, the lethal ex-CIA operative from the predecessor. Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace return as his ex-wife and daughter, respectively. Set roughly two years after the events of the first film, 'Taken 2' begins with the blood relatives of the Albanian sex traffickers from the original swearing revenge on Bryan, led by Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) . Bryan meanwhile, is still overprotective about his daughter. When he invites his ex-wife and daughter to a vacation in Istanbul after providing security to an Arab sheikh, it's only a matter of time when the holiday goes awry.Now 'Taken' was no piece of great cinema. It had a simple plot but was an excellently executed film with great hand-to-hand action sequences. 'Taken 2' is pretty much the same, but thankfully doesn't follow the exact blueprint of the prequel, like the massively disappointing 'Hangover 2' did. This film throws up an interesting situation where Bryan and his ex-wife are captured, and it is up to their daughter to rescue them. Armed with every possible weapon in his briefcase and a remarkable ability to find a needle in a haystack, Neeson does here 'what he does best'. He perfectly slips into the character of Bryan Mills and makes him a relatively believable person compared to what most action stars in this role would have done. The supporting cast do their jobs adequately. I am a huge fan of hand-to-hand action sequences and this one has plenty of it. One of the highlights here is a thrilling car chase involving a cab around the halfway mark. Another thing worth noting is that the film doesn't overstay it's welcome. At a crisp 90 minutes, it makes for a lazy,popcorn-laden afternoon. Now there are big plot holes here and there, but despite all of that, 'Taken 2' delivers exactly what everyone wanted. Liam Neeson kicking some serious ass. Admit it,not even you can say 'no' to that.",7,1,2,22 October 2012
