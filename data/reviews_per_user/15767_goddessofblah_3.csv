Black Swan," i don't get the hype?
","OK so this film was officially the most over-hyped piece of overly dramatic film where things happen for no reason and tries way too hard to be Avant-garde and amazing when it's just a prima donna gone crazy due to pressure to perform from her mummy dearest It's The American Psycho meets Mean Girls.The author just uses lots of titillating scenes of girl-on-girl action, or girl pressuring herself, older-perv action and girl being weird action.Then you have lots more scenes which are meant to be significant but are just tedious nonsense that the director thinks makes him look profound The whole thing was more about being all arty and trying to shock for the sake of shocking rather than a plot that held my interest Some people can be bought into thinking this was a masterpiece because it's arty and it's artistic merit isn't something plebs will understand But like obscure paintings and art that are meant to be amazing, but which only pretentious people appreciate, this film is exactly the same.Tedious.",1,6,9,30 July 2016
American Sniper," very silly
","I was hoping to see a profoundly dramatic rendition of the American solider mind set, instead we're given the inside mechanics of a psycho 1. Dude likes to kill people 2. Dude loves to kill people 3. Dude particularly likes to kill Iraqis defending themselves from a foreign invasion.So this film, which I watched on TV was about a dude who is the least sympathetic character you could find.It didn't deal with anything that could make me feel, 'wow what a profound film' but just think 'how silly'Overall, I can understand it's appeal to right-wing Americans and those who enjoy army films that don't require much thoughtBut those of you want something intellectually challenging may struggleAlso, the acting could have been better",1,3,20,30 July 2016
Up," Best Pixar film
","When I went to watch this at my local cinema, I wasn't expecting much.Was babysitting and wasn't sure what to do with the kids Didn't think they'd like it, and wasn't sure I would.Old man and a kid on a flying house? Sounded barney Then I went to watch it...1st 5 mins, loved the little girl and boy. Cute 10 mins - I'm crying - OMG how sad is this? Most beautiful love story which ends with a lonely old man.20 mins - cute chubby boy makes me laugh a..anyway don't want to give it away but it's awesome.Loads of plot holes and timing doesn't add up with certain things, and where on earth is Social Services etc, but very good.I loved the plot, the relationship building, the feel-good factor and the jokes.Overall, the best Pixar film out there",10,0,2,30 July 2016
