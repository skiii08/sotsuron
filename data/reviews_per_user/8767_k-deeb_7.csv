Casablanca," Classic Casablanca
","Casablanca is an excellent classic. I don't know any other movie which could stay in the same set for most of the movie, and yet still be captivating. The opening of the film is creative with the voice over as we travel along the globe from Germany to Casablanca to Lisbon. A great opening sets us up for a great film; one of the greatest of all time? Perhaps, but nonetheless a wonderful masterpiece.Humphrey Bogart was excellent. This was the first movie I've seen of his, and everyone said this was a challenge because this was his first lead romantic role. Being my first movie, I could not tell that this was his first role in a romantic lead. He was excellent, and nothing but excellence showed. Bergman was excellent and beautiful in her lead actress role and really made Ilsa who she was. She took the role and made it her own.The storyline was interesting, but contained a lot of dialogue, and most of it took place in Rick's. This was the only downfall, but despite this it was still entertaining.",Null,1,3,19 October 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," A warming story of family struggles...
","Grapes of Wrath was a warming film of family overcoming struggles together, and making ends meet. Henry Fonda plays a compassionate ex-con, on parole, who goes west hoping for a better life with his family. The Joad family faces its good share of struggles. First being kicked out of their house because of the government, then moving out of a camp because it's going to be burned, and going form location to location looking for work and money, to simply put food on the table. Yet through all the struggles, the family sticks together, and somehow makes it through. Despite Henry Fonda, Tom, leaving in the end, their is hope for the family.The film carries a strong message of family love and is wonderfully directed and acted. Fonda's expressions, eyes, and acting are perfect along with Jane Darwell as Mama Joad, who holds the family together and keeps the family's hope alive. It is filmed well with good use of lighting and shadows to create a masterpiece.",Null,0,1,12 October 2011
The Exorcist," Well that was scary...
","The Exorcist was beyond scary. It was a good movie that deals with quite a scary and not really well known topic and it was good. The script gives a good depth of the characters and was well written. Then of course there's the camera-work. In a scary movie like this and an exorcist movie you'd expect the filming to capture angles and the darkness. The lighting and color were excellent with great use of light and dark to convey the feeling that is necessary. Jason Miller (don't know much about him) but he was excellent and subtle, and Von Sydow and Cobb were excellent supporting actors as the priest and detective. And of course Blair is very convincing and terrifying and Burstyn as the desperate mother trying to help her daughter.The Exorcist with great filming, lighting, coloring, script and acting really made a great movie, that was scary and hit on a huge topic of good vs evil and God.",Null,1,2,16 December 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," Good movie beautifully created
","2001 is a different movie, but is captured beautifully. If you're into a movie having a concrete plot and in depth characters then this movie isn't for you, but if you can appreciate the beauty of cinematography then you will enjoy this film. Despite not having the best plot and concrete in depth characters, the director does an excellent job creating beauty and putting the audience in awe of the sequences and images that are captured. They are simply put beautiful. To really enjoy it I think it should be viewed on a full theater screen, I could not imagine how magnificent that would be. But I wasn't around when it came out so my 46' TV will have to do. With the use of special effects and technology of that day Stanley Kubrick did a fantastic job creating space travel. He got as accurate as he could and it was nicely done. Simply put, given the resources that Kubrick had of the time period, and the plot, it was beautifully made and captured, and had its terrifying sequences (I.E. Hal...nuf said...)",Null,0,1,7 December 2011
The Graduate," Geesh I feel bad for Dustin Hoffman...
","The Graduate is in a sense accurate. I'm not talking about the affair with a parents friend, no, I'm talking about the pressure of coming out of college and not knowing what you're going to pursue. We join Benjamin (Hoffman) on an inner struggle of dealing with the pressure of being a college graduate and everybody wondering what he's going to do with his life. Hoffman cracks under the pressure and during his much needed time off of school falls into the snare of Anne Bancroft.A controversial (especially for its time) storyline that has great wit, especially in the beginning when Hoffman is being seduced. The acting, especially Hoffman as a naive and inexperience graduate makes for some quite humorous scenes with the beautifully enticing, experience, and cunning Anne Bancroft. It broke trends in society, and really crossed the line with a story line like this in that time period, but it had to happen sometime.The camera-work was excellent with many POV character shots, still shots, long shots etc. And then with the background music of Simon and Garfunkel made the movie that much more better. With great acting, camera-work, storyline, and humor this film was good despite the infidelity.",Null,0,0,9 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Great musical and romance...even though i don't like musicals...
","Singin' in the Rain has it all. And all of it is really good. An array of songs, a top notch cast (led by Gene Kelly), a script that contains romantic and exciting writing, and the picture and color of the movie is vivid and beautiful. Yes there are some holes here and there, and the plot is 'cheesy' and silly but that's what a musical is. Cheesy, hammed up, with everyone singing and dancing. Not my take for a good movie, but Singin in the Rain was I must admit a good musical. This musical not only contains the obvious music but also contains a hint of comedy.In a nutshell, this movie has a good screen play but is made better through the fluid directing and excellent acting and cast.",Null,0,1,16 November 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Don't know what to say...awesome movie
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest was unbelievable. Well it was very believable because of the good acting, but you know what I mean. With stars early in their career most importantly Jack Nicholson, and others like Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd etc. This film's plot was very well written and very interesting. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and hit on a soft topic and portrayed the realities of what mental hospitals were like, more of a prison than a hospital.The movie was well paced. It didn't rush through important scenes but didn't drag and give too much detail. The editing was tight and well done. Besides for the editing, the script was well written. Each and every line was needed and perfect for each character. The sternness of nurse Ratched, the smart remarks of Nicholson, and the silent Will Sampson. The mise-en-scene, supposed to be a hospital, depicted the harsh realities of the hospital with the prison bars and very controlled environment.If you want to see a spectacular movie with Jack Nicholson in his early prime then this is the movie to watch. It has supreme acting, a hard heart-wrenching plot to swallow, and a tightly edited movie that does not rest for a minute and keeps you thoroughly entertained.",Null,0,1,15 December 2011
