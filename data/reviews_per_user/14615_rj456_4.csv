Skyfall," Just Avoid It + I Am Wondering Why So Many Critics Liked It?
","Let me begin from the end by summarizing it and saying that it is probably the worse movie in the Bond franchise, here are some pointers: 01. The production said that the budget of the movie was around 200$ million dollars, unless the actors received 180$ Millions from it I have no idea how they came up with such an enormous sum, something is really fishy in their claim.02. The script of the movie is just terrible! It's not A typical Bond film, one can barely call it an action movie, it's more like A soap, before I saw the movie I was wondering why it's so long (Almost 2.5 hours), after seeing it I understood! The dialogs between the main characters are just endless and tiring, about two thirds of the movie is filled with endless babbles. You can forget about funny anecdotes that use to be so familiar with Bond or the ingenuity that set him apart from the average Jo and his nemesis, for the third movie in A row now Bond is all about brawn no brain. 03. The plot is even worse than the script, here are few examples (out of many!). The bad guy 'Silva' wants to kill 'M' (revenge), why not just kill her? He has the resources, he has the ability, he is not shown as an idiot, so why suddenly act as one? His people also try to kill Bond A couple of times but once he captures Bond, he 'forgets' that he wants kill him and instead he wants to give him 'A moral lecture' A thing that which makes him look like the most idiotic villain ever. Another example, 'M' and her people tell Bond that the fragments of the bullet that hit Bond are traced back to an 'international terrorist' which has murdered the American ambassador in Yemen and the Americans are looking for him for 3 years!! Suddenly 'M's' chief of staff says that they have sources that say that this person will be in Shanghai in 3 days and suddenly you see Bond waiting for him at the airport (seems like they even knew his flight number). Even the opening scene of the movie which was the most exciting in the entire film is full with holes and mistakes and is just far fetched.I Can go on and on but in all it is really not A worthy Bond movie, and an insult to the intelligence of the viewers. And 3 movies are A long enough run to come to the conclusion that Craig is not the person to portray Bond, he is A good actor but he is just too serious, he has no sense of humor what so ever not to mention that he lacks the charm that Moore/Connery possessed. Craig looks more like A muscled bodyguard, A bouncer at A club when he should be portraying A suave, sophisticated cerebral assassin, apparently something he is not capable of.There are many terrible reviews on this movie (seems like A record number here at IMDb) which makes me wonder why so many of the 'official critics' liked it? Did they miss what almost most of us saw? Are they getting paid to write these positive reviews? (most likely!) Or maybe they are just terrible critics and we should almost ALWAYS avoid what critics say.",1,13,23,16 February 2013
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," One Of The Worse Movies Ever Made..
","I'm Not Even Gonna Write About This So Called 'Movie'. I Have Watched Plenty Of Movies In My Life Time And This Is Undoubtedly One Of The Worse If Not The Worse Movie I Have Ever Seen. It Is So Bad That I Don't Even Have One Decent Thing To Say About It. I Watched It With Family And Friends And Everyone Aggreed It Was Horrible And A Waste Of Time. I Am Saying It's One Of The Worse Movies Ever Cause When The Movie Ended I Really Felt That I Spent Almost Two Hours Of My Life In Vain, Felt Bad About Wasting My Time And Watching It, A Feeling I Don't Recall In Many Years.Three More Comments: 1. Sorry I Didn't Write About The Movie Itself But Honestly If You'll Can Skip It Just Do So!! 2. The Only 'Good Thing' I Can Say About This Movie Is That It Brought Together Pitt And Jolie (Ofcourse Others Might Say It Had A Negative Side). 3. I Really Don't Believe At All The Average Grade This Movie Has Received, I Am Sure People Are Not That Stupid And More Than That, The Higher Voting Is From People That Are A: Die Hard Fans Of Pitt/Jolie B: Related Somehow To The Production. I Can Say That My Biggest Mistake Was Not Entering IMDb And Reading What Others Have Said And Written About This Movie, If I Would Have I Am Sure I Would'nt Watch It As Over 80% Of The Comments Are Totally Negative.Just Avoid This Horrible 'Movie'",1,5,11,5 January 2008
Casino Royale," Not A Bond Movie Anyone Should Recommend...
","I Have To Begin And Say That The Movie Is Fair Entertainment, And Although Many Doubted Craigs Skills Before Entering The Role, I Had Confidence That He Will Perform Well Cause Frankly I Just Didn't Like Brosnan As Bond! Brosnan Reminds Me Of A Sleeky Salesman And Not Of A Secret Agent. But After Watching The Movie I Have To Say That, I Was Rather Disappointed With Craig, He Just Doesn't Have What It Takes To Be Bond, He Is To Crude, To Tough, A Person That Prefers Brawns Over Brains. A Character Without Charm, Sense Of Houmour Things That Were Natural With Connery,Moore Etc Just Like Dalton I Have A Feeling That Craig Wont Make It To The Third Movie, Although Frankly Speaking I Think That Dalton Was A Fine Bond. About The Movie Itself, What Disappointed Me The Most Was That I Got A Feeling That The Producers Did Their Best To Save Money On It!! Or On The Other Hand Weren't Wise And Spent It All In A Wrong Way. They Wanted Minimum Investment Maximum Profit. To Explain Myself: In The Movie Itself There Are No Gadgets At All!! No Unusual Spectacular Innovations We Are So Used To From All Bond Movies, Instead There Is Lots Of Lets Call It, Street Fighting, Bond Just Beats Up And Gets Beaten Up To Many Times During The Movie, On Cranes, Inside A Hotel, At A Falling Apart Building In Venice, No Brains Are Used By Bond To Get Out Of The Tough Situations He Encouters But Mostly Violence. Another Thing Most Of Secnes Or Should I Say Chases Are Rather Lame, For Example The Chase With The Special Aston Martin DBS Which Was Made Specially By Aston Martin Is Really Short And Useless, The Car Crashes In Less Than 20 Seconds, Again You End Up With A Feeling That Someone Was Short Of Imagination Or Short Of Money. The Chase At The International Airport Of Miami Is More Exciting But Again Not Something You Would Expect From A Bond Movie, And It Is Something You'll Have Seen A Million Times In Action Movies. There Is Another Big Problem With The Movie Was: Commercials In The Movie, Just One Example Out Of Many They Show Various Types Of Cel Phones During The Movie, Every Few Minutes!! And Whats Horrible Is The Crazy Amount Of The Sms Messages That Beeped Through The Movie Between The Actors, Rather Disgusting Honestly. The Movies Name Is Casino Royale But That Doesn't Mean That The Director And The Editors Have To Show Us A Bunch Of People Sitting On A Table Playing Poker In A Total Unrealistic Way, Which By The Way Makes It Boring To Watch, In All For Around 35 Minutes Of The Movies Time. To Summerise Things: I've Seen All Bond Movies At least 3 Times, So When I Say It Just Wasn't Good I Can Compare It In My Mind To Each And Every Movie, Each And Every Bit From Every Movie, When I Go To See A Bond Movie I Want A Fantasy World As Some Hav Written, A Fantasy World That Include All The Things You'll Find In Bond Movies, Things That Don't Appear In Other Action Movies, Lets Call It Trade Marks Of Bond Movies, And All Of Those Trade Marks Have Just Gone. 1. Craig Is A Good Actor But Doesn't Fit The Role. 2. No Q/R, Branches, No Moneypenny. 3. No Gadgets. 4. Almost No Beautiful Women, The Main Bond Girl Is Pretty, But Most Of Us Wont Remember A Second After The Movie How She Looked Like. 5. To Many Holes In The Plot, And The End Of The Movie Is Just Messy And Unreliable. * Just Left With A Feeling That The Directors, And Producers Wanted To Rap Up Things As Quick As Possible And Send It To The PR To Sell Us This Movie. To Bad That Some Cinema Critics Bought It, But That Also Tells You'll Not To Pay To Much Attention To Critics. 3/10",3,15,26,17 December 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Yes It's Good.. Butttt
","Im Just Going To Write What I Liked And Disliked In The Movie. Things I Liked: 1. Bruce Willis Was Very Good As Usual, Good Homour, Fine Acting, All The Clich√©s We Are Used From The Previous Movies Were Acted By Him In An Elegant Way, Without Taking Himself To Serious, But Still Entering The Role Well. 2. Action In The Movie Is None Stop, You Surely Wont Get Bored For 2 Hours, One Things Follows The Next Which Keeps You Aware, Awake And On Your Toes. 3. High Budget Movie Which Means Exciting And Surprising Mega Scenes Which Will Make You'll Go Wow From Time To Time, This Movie Brings The Level Of Action We Are Used To See In Movies Into The Next And Higher Level.Things I Disliked About The Movie Were: 1. Cast Beside Bruce Willis Was Rather Lame, Bad Guys Aren't Really Convincing, Even The Good Guys, The Supporting Cast Lack Charisma, Especially If You Compare It To The Excellent Actors That Played In The Previous Movies, This Is Surely One Of The Weakest Points Of The Movie, Don't Know Who Chose The Entire Cast But Someone Did A Bad Job. 2. The Plot Was Really Lame, Im Not Saying That Something Like This Couldn't Happen But The Way It Was Executed On The Screen Was Rather Weak In Its Reliability. 3. The Last Part Of The Movie Was The Weakest, The Places At Which They Were Shot Are Not Worthy For This Series, One Example, It Really Looks Fake How Bruce Willis Follows The Bad Guys, And 'By Chance' Sees Into Which Warehouse They Have Entered, And Of course, The Bad Guys HAVE TO WAIT For Him To Arrive, So He Can Kill Them, Really A Weak Ending.In All Movie Isn't Bad, You'll Will Surely Have 2 Hours Of Fine Entertainment, Its Worth 6.5 Out Of 10, Mostly Because Of Bruce Willis And The Money The 'Blew Up' To Make It, By The Way The Director Of Movie Is Really Not Worth Of This Series Either, Seems To Me His Point Of View Is Like Of A Small Child Who's More Interested Bombastic And Entertaining Explosions, Which Don't Always Look Reliable, Then The Plot And The Characters Which Should Be The Basis Of Any Movie. If Not The Money And Bruce Willis I Would Give It Much Less.Well Maybe I Had To Much Expectations Cause I Really Loved The Previous Movies, Loved Them From The First Time I Saw Them ;-)",5,4,9,7 July 2007
