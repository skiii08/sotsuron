The King's Speech," A royal speech lesson
","Most historians seem to agree that since that minor German princeling George of Hanover was placed on the throne of the United Kingdom for no better reason that he was a protestant great-grandchild of James I, the throne has been occupied by, well, dullards. These have been of two sorts; the flamboyant as personified by George IV, Edward VII and Edward VIII, and the dutiful, such as Victoria, George V and the present incumbent. The subject of this film, her father Bertie, was definitely of the dutiful sort, but it was a duty he thought he was spared for until his air-head of an older brother fell for the charms of the twice divorced American social adventuress Wallis Simpson and renounced the throne to marry her. For poor Bertie has a serious stutter, and while the British Monarchy is expected to do nothing in particular it is expected to do it rather well.The film tells how an uncredentialed but very experienced Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), helped Bertie, later George VI (Colin Firth), overcome his speech problem. Some liberty is taken with the facts to orchestrate a dramatic build-up to the fine speech Bertie gave as king on the outbreak of World War II in 1939 (by then Logue's therapy over 12 years had considerably improved things), but the scriptwriters, who had access to Logue's diaries, are able to re-create the singular relationship that developed between two men of contrasting backgrounds. Some of Logue's methodology is still a bit shadowy but whatever he got his patients to do, it mostly worked. Logue was convinced the root cause of stutters and stammers was psychological, and given that bullying was an integral part of a English 'public' school upbringing it wasn't hard to see the causes. However he struck trouble with Bertie, who was not about to let Logue loose in his psychohistory. Eventually, Logue prevails, but we also have to hand it to Bertie as well. Old George V (Michael Gambon) was right about one thing, Bertie might not have been the sharpest knife in the palace kitchen but he was blessed with great perseverance.Actually, it's hard to fault this film. The minor characters are a delight, but the two leads are terrific. Rush is utterly convincing as the slightly raffish ex-amateur actor turned therapist while Firth, always good as agonisied characters, excels himself as the battling Bertie. If anyone is going to get an academy award, it should be the two of them, jointly. Helena Bonham Carter as Bertie's bright and loving consort also merits a mention. Apparently the Queen Mother (as she later became) found the memories of Bertie's speech struggles too painful to revisit in her lifetime, but she would not have been too unhappy with the result here.The British royal family has been the subject of some quite decent films in recent years, 'The Queen' (about Elizabeth II and Diana's death) and 'Mrs Brown' (about Queen Victoria and her Scottish gillie), and this would have to rank as one of the better ones, though as usual the film makers have been locked out of the actual royal locations.. Curing speech defects normally would not give rise to much drama, but in this particular case there is an undeniable connection with great events. It is impossible to say how much effect George VI's speeches had on the British war effort and many would say Churchill (played here with great panache by Timothy Spall, who has the great man's voice off perfectly) was more influential. But it's safe to say neither did much harm.",9,2,4,30 December 2010
Black Swan," Gripping but nasty
","I'm afraid this movie falls within the brilliant but nasty class, or to put it another way it deals exclusively with the darker side of human nature. There is no light and shade, no humour, just a careering down the slope to inevitable disaster. We are very effectively put right into the mind of the principal character, a girl-woman who is an outstanding dancer but a very fragile human being in a tough environment. Her mother, a former dancer, has undoubtedly pushed her hard, but you can't put Nina's troubles down to Mum alone. There is Thomas the Svengali –like choreographer who is trying to arouse her dormant sexual feelings to get a better performance, and jealous other dancers. Plus, I suppose, the bitch-goddess success, more evident in New York than just about anywhere else.Director Darren Aronofsky succeeds only too well in putting us inside Nina's mind. The loud soundtrack makes even the subway's clatter sinister and Tchaikovsky's music (played backwards apparently) menacing. The shaky hand-held camera adds to the claustrophobic malaise, though the grey concrete of backstage Lincoln Center (not the actual place) is pretty grim as well. A ballet movie for masochists, I thought. Even so, Natalie Portman puts in a brilliant performance. She is absolutely convincing, as are her delusions. It is certainly difficult to distinguish between what is actually happening and what is merely the product of Nina's addled imagination. I also liked Mila Kunis as the over-eager understudy/competitor and Barbara Hershey as Nina's controlling but anxious mother.Classical Ballet is normally a refined form of theatre, and the production here follows the conventions – and then trashes them. There is too much suffering and not enough art, it seems. I don't know whether the original writer was trying to make a point about the suffering required to produce great art, but Aronofsky certainly makes Nina suffer. He also makes a mess of Tchaikovsky's work, which is conveniently out of copyright and unacknowledged except in the very small print. I don't think I'll be rushing to see his next film.",6,3,7,3 February 2011
Frost_Nixon," Gripping entertainment, not history
","Although this film is the adaptation of a stage play (by Peter Morgan) about the making of a series of television interviews in 1977 between hotshot but lightweight British interviewer David Frost and Richard Milhous Nixon, disgraced ex-President of the United States, the stage origins do not show. Good use is made of close-ups and the naturalistic settings. However the minor characters remain minor and what we have in essence is a duel. Frost, prodded by his researchers is trying to get Nixon to confess to his Watergate misdemeanours (some might say felonies), and Nixon is fighting while he still can to salvage his shredded reputation. It is a tense and exciting battle.David Frost himself, although appreciative of the attention, apparently thinks that he was incorrectly portrayed as inexperienced  he had already interviewed Ronald Reagan, Robert Kennedy, Harold Wilson and Ted Heath  but Michael Sheen, a noted Tony Blair impersonator as Frost, has got him down pat. Frost is youthful, eager, determined, and at times desperate, as the whole enterprise, which he has largely funded (none of the American TV networks would participate in the production), seems to be heading towards the rocks. His researchers, particularly the dislikeable James Reston Jr are keen to nail Nixon, but the 'smoking gun', a taped conversation with an aide, does not emerge until late in the piece.Some license has been taken with the facts, for example the revealing telephone conversation between the two the night before the final interview session is entirely fictitious, but it reveals a great deal about what the two men thought of each other. The emphasis on Frost's social life and girlfriends is exaggerated, but there is a point to it  Nixon's obvious envy and social ineptitude. Frank Langdell's Nixon, heavy in defeat, is finely drawn and he evokes some sympathy. In the actual interview Nixon avoided being pathetic and was a good deal more chipper.As entertainment, Ron Howard's film succeeds very well, but it does not add much to what we know about the Nixon presidency, or Watergate. I continue to be amazed how people with such obvious personal shortcomings can be elected to high office, but it has to be admitted that some Richard Nixon's foreign policies (eg China) were better than some of his successors, even if he was lying when he said 'I am not a crook'.",8,7,14,5 January 2009
Catch Me If You Can," Catch me another 100 million
","If I hadn't known that Steven Spielberg, the most financially successful bad director Hollywood has produced, had directed this movie, it wouldn't have taken me long to guess. There is a certain sticky sweetness, a sunniness of mood that is vintage Spielberg and which sits uneasily with the theme of crime and punishment. Not that Frank Abagnale Jr was a particularly vicious criminal, but here cheque fraud is portrayed as being nice clean crime, and we find ourselves wanting to see Frank get away with it, and make his FBI pursuer Carl Hanratty look even more of a bumblefoot than he is already. There is something rather manipulative about a movie that has us cheering the bad guy. Well, I guess not even Steve Spielberg, rich as he is, likes banks, and the nice thing about cheque fraud is that it usually the bank that loses, not the customer.That said, this a very watchable entertainment. The 1960s are beautifully evoked, not only through the décor, cars, manners and clothes, but in the accurate portrayal of air travel as the height of glamour and sophistication. Pam American and TWA were almost institutions; alas they did not survive deregulation and the proletarianisation of the air travel market.Leonardo Di Caprico, though in his late 20s, is a slightly pudgy, pretty sort of guy and gets away with portraying the precocious teenage Frank. Appropriately it is a charming performance though he does not have a big range. Tom Hanks as Carl glowers a lot and eats a lot of bad food, but I found it hard to evoke a lot of sympathy for him. With the resources the FBI had at its disposal Frank's capture should have taken weeks, not years. But then it would not have been such a good story, one which is made more intriguing by the relationship between Frank and his father, an unsuccessful business man (nicely played by Christopher Walken). Frank learned a lot about the con man's game from his Dad, though Dad lacked the audacity Frank displays. Frank's relationship with his mother (elusively played by Nathalie Baye) is also explored, but in a perfunctory way. It's a lengthy movie, 2 hours 20 minutes and it does drag a bit. The 'happy ending' is anti-climactic, though I can well believe it took some time to actually get Frank working for the FBI. And he's never left! Must be the pension plan.WARNING: SPOILER. At one point in the proceedings Carl asks Frank how he managed to cheat his way through the Louisiana bar exam, which Frank passed despite not having a law degree (he was only 18). Frank refuses to say. Later, we learn what happened  Frank crammed for two weeks and passed the exam on his merits. This is perfectly explicable. Bar exams cover basic black letter law which merely has to be parroted back to satisfy the examiners. Some maintain that to have a law degree from a decent school is a positive disability to passing bar exams. Most law graduates sign up for a cramming course for the particular bar exam they wish to do. Maybe Frank did the same.",Null,0,1,9 February 2003
Minority Report," A Christmas pudding of a movie
","The resources put into Hollywood blockbusters are truly staggering; it's not just the money, but the skill as well, especially into one like this, with its polished special effects, virtuoso stunts and huge sets. `Gladiator' and `Titanic' may have been flawed as drama, but we filmgoers sure got a visual spectacle. Here there is plenty of spectacle, in the form of Spielberg's Washington of 2054 (owing something to Fritz Lang's `Metropolis') but we something else besides, a serious philosophical question, as well as plenty of action, intelligent dialogue and some good performances from Tom Cruise, Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton. Even the supporting cast are stronger than average. There's a lot to take in; it's a real Christmas dinner of a movie, and you wonder sometimes if Spielberg hasn't overloaded his viewers.At least he doesn't insult their intelligence. It is to a large extent a chase movie but there's also some suspense as to what the chase is all about. The storyline of the film is a genuine examination of the ethics of acting on information about the future. The `pre-cogs' who foresee future murders are kept in conditions no ethicist would accept, but, assuming such an ability exists, there is a very interesting question: Should society intervene even when a future murderer has no present intention of committing the crime? In some limited circumstances people with a strong propensity to commit certain sexual offences and people who suffer mental delusions which make them likely serious offenders are kept in preventive custody but usually they have got there because of earlier criminal acts.  In Spielberg's 2054 the only sanction for a future crime is `containment' (suspended animation) for an indefinite period. As most of the murders are not premediated, and hence not likely to carry the death penalty, it seems you might be better off to kill somebody outside the jurisdiction and then do the jail term.  The larger issue, I guess, is have we free will, or are our lives pre-determined? There is an easy answer to that; if our lives are pre-determined we don't know what our future holds, so we might as well proceed on the basis that we have free will and therefore are responsible for what we do. We cannot be responsible for what we might or might not do. The Department of Future Crime works to a high order of probability (far higher that could ever be achieved in any future reality but even it can make mistakes -hence `minority reports'). Even so, why should it protect potential killers against their own impulses? Isn't that a matter for individual responsibility? As for the victims, some contribute through their conduct to their own demise eg where a battered spouse rises up against her (usually) tormentor. How do we deal with the narrow legal lines between murder, manslaughter and justifiable homicide? The justice system operates with the wisdom of hindsight and a Dept of Future Crime, in its anxiety to prevent a murder, may act without regard to all the matters which must be considered for a just result.Still, a superior effort. Enjoyable, thought-provoking and a visual treat.",Null,0,0,9 July 2002
Erin Brockovich," True Fairy Tale from Toxic Tort Country
","Lightweight legal drama with a feel-good ending enlivened by a sparkling script and good chemistry between the leads. I say legal drama, though the courtroom scenes are brief, because it is largely an account of the real Ms Brockovich's legwork (in more than one sense) that brought about the largest toxic tort settlement to date. The victims were the unlucky inhabitants of a small Mojave desert town, Hinkley, California, many of whom were seriously affected by the release into their environment of a poisonous industrial chemical, hexavalent chromium. The villain was Pacific Gas and Electric, the power utility. Erin Brockovich, a single mother with three young children who had bullied Ed Masry, the aging accident lawyer who had just lost her road accident compensation case, into giving her a paralegal job, found a file relating to a Hinkley land purchase by P G &E, which had some unusual features, and started digging. She rounded up over 600 claimants, stacks of evidence (including the proverbial smoking gun), and achieved a remarkable reasonably prompt result - $333 million in damages from a $28 billion dollar corporation.The fictional account of this engaging story naturally goes out of its way to tug on the heartstrings so we get lots of Ms B's private life  financial worries, job-hunting blues, childcare problems and the ups and downs of her relationship with George, a sweet-natured biker. The real interest in the story is in two things. One, her remarkable people skills ranging from flashing her ample cleavage to get co-operation from a records clerk to establishing real empathy with the abused victims of P G &E, a skill few lawyers possess. (Like a lot of good lawyers she does possess an excellent memory.) The second is her relationship with Ed, the old crash and bash man, who she irritates into winning the case of his life, long after it seemed forensic glory had passed him by. Ed is not driven by lust (he's a bit old for that) but is shamed into action, and after a while he realizes that Erin has got what it takes, even though he treats her shabbily on occasion.
Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed are a curious combination. It was odd to cast Finney, an English actor with a strong regional accent, as a Southern Californian ambulance-chaser with maybe a middle eastern background. Julia Roberts makes the transition from romantic comedy heroine to a more character-driven role with ease and she and Finney bounce off each other very satisfactorily without Finney seeming to want to lay a hand on her, despite her provocative dress sense. Stephen Soderbergh, who dealt with kinky Southern sex in `Sex, Lies and Videotape', has made a pretty orthodox piece here, but it is well done and many of the minor characters are well filled out. Aaron Eckhart is very appealing, if a little too good to be true, as George. One of the real judges in the case repeats his role on film and Erin herself appears briefly as a waitress in a fast food outlet who has no trouble remembering complicated orders.Poor old P G & E. really get it in the neck. Although they are exposed as having attempted early on to defeat the Hinkley inhabitants' legal rights by a tactical confession of their sins, the subsequent conduct of the matter by their representatives indicates a very stupid bunch indeed  not even smart enough to be called evil (compare `Silkwood'). Unlike John Travolta in `Class Action' who had Robert Duvall as his Big Corporate nemesis, Erin and Ed lacked a worthy opponent. This rather reduces the dramatic tension, but the real-life Erin and Ed obviously know they are on to a good thing  they are now doing their best to drive up power bills even further by suing P G&E over another toxic tort elsewhere in California.",Null,1,2,22 April 2000
Memento," Film Noir in Reverse Gear
","`The Arabians learn Arabian with the speed of summer lightning And the Hebrews learn it backwards which is absolutely frightening'.I don't know whether writer-director Christopher Nolan is Hebrew or Arabian (Arabic is also written from right to left) but he has made effective use of inverting the usual procedure of telling the story from beginning to end. You'd think it would be hard to maintain tension in a thriller when we know at the start who did what to whom, but you are kept on your toes by the necessity to work out just how each succeeding scene fits in to the previous one (which is the one later in time  got that?)The other bit of artifice is Leonard Shelby's loss of short term memory. This is certainly an odd ailment since he is clearly able to concentrate on what he is doing eg taking his aide-memoire polaroids, making love or killing someone in revenge for his wife's murder, not to mention finding where he parked his Jaguar, yet he cannot remember what happens from scene to scene  we the audience, running backwards in time, have to do that for him. He conditions himself to `remember' some things and, being a well-organised fellow with his photos, notes and tattoos, copes a bit better than the unlucky Sammy Jankis he met in his previous life as an insurance investigator.The actual plot is pretty mundane  innocent victim of drug-related crime, man out for revenge, shady beauty helping, bent cop using man for own ends - but is very effectively packaged and well acted out. Guy Pearce as Leonard spends a lot of the time in his underwear, but, cutely good-looking as he is, he does a brilliant job of inciting our sympathies even as we realise that a man who can't remember killing someone is a very dangerous person indeed. John Pantoliano as Teddy the bent cop is relentlessly amiable even as it becomes clear he is up to no good. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie the drug dealer's girlfriend who helps Guy for her own reasons has a careworn beauty that transcends her commonplace lines and foul language.The action is not too hard to follow and the suspense is maintained until the end. The only slightly puzzling feature was the use of some sepia sequences  one scene really, running forward in time but broken up and scattered through the film. It didn't seem to add much to the action though it provided some of the explanation as to who Guy had got where he was.
Altogether, an interesting variation of the film noir revenge genre. I couldn't help thinking, though it was a bit like watching someone drive their car with great facility round an obstacle course and high speed in reverse gear. Impressive, but all a bit artificial.",Null,0,2,28 April 2001
Inglourious Basterds," War is hell, but even hell has its humorous side
","Not having read the user comments section of this web site before I saw the movie (I had read a couple of favorable critical reviews), I was quite taken aback by the divided response. No-one walked out of the packed session I went to. For one thing, it passed the watch test – in the 150 minute running time I looked at my watch not once. The blend of comedy, film buffery and action overlays some seriousness of purpose. Yes, in war both sides are capable of atrocities and generally commit them without much thought. Yes, some Nazis were witty, intelligent and charming, if not actually lovable. Yes, the world would have been a different place if Hitler and his gang had been disposed of in the summer of 1944. This is entertainment, not history, however, even if the German uniforms and wartime French bars are painstakingly reproduced.I thought the whole thing was very well constructed. The 5 long 'chapters', with their own denouements are all carefully linked. Apart from the final catharsis, they all feature the quiet build-up of tension through conversation to an almost unbearable degree – final moments of mayhem come as a relief. Yes, it's a very talky movie but the dialogue has many flashes of brilliance. I'm sorry for all those who don't like subtitles – I thought they were well used. But wasn't there too much sadism, blood and gore? That's war folks.Even the sternest critics concede the Austrian actor Christoph Waltz put in a stunning performance as Colonel Landa the urbane SS Jew hunter. Brad Pitt's hillbilly chief basterd, Aldo Raine, was somewhat overshadowed, but it was not a very demanding part. Melanie Laurent as Shosanna, the young Jewish cinema owner bent on revenge, relied more on her beauty than histrionics, but her presence was unforgettable. It was nice to see that Rod Taylor at 80 can still do Churchillian tones. About the only below par performance was Mike Myers ('Austin Powers'), totally miscast as a British general. Daniel Bruhl from 'Goodbye Lenin' was excellent as Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' blue-eyed boy who falls for Shosanna.As for the film buffery, some I appreciated, some went over my head, and some was below my radar, but I can't say it interfered with my enjoyment of the film. I didn't really see this movie as a spoof of the World War II film genre, a major part of my movie diet when I was growing up. Tarantino has added something of his own here – he's Spielberg with a sense of humour and an understanding of that allegedly rare American trait, irony. As the unfortunate (and unfortunately named) Lt Archie Hicox), film critic turned not terribly successful secret agent, might have said 'I await with eager anticipation and great trepidation this director's next work.'",8,2,8,12 September 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Elizabethan entertainment
","Shakespeare being part of Anglo-America's literary heritage, filmmakers still think it worthwhile artistically and financially to seek a new angle on Will's oeuvre despite the plethora of previous productions and relentless dissection of the plays in Eng Lit courses. This clever, colourful and well-paced film asks: who was Will the man, and what drove him to write such enduring plays for the theatre, that most ephemeral of the arts?Well. fear, lust and survival loom large. But this Shakespeare also has a need to be heard and a need to be loved. It is London, 1593, and 29 year old Will (Joseph Fiennes), married to an older woman back in Stratford he hasn't seen for years, is desperately trying to write something to keep the doors of  the South Bank theatre of his hard-pressed not to say singed friend Henslowe (Geoffery Rush) open. There's fierce competition from Burbage's Curtain Theatre across the river. Will has had some earlier success with plays about Kings with Roman numerals after their names, but Henslowe is demanding a comedy to get bums on seats. Will, however, has a severe case of writer's block and even consults a magician/apothecary, the Elizabethan equivalent of a psychoanalyst. 'Fall in love,' says Dr Moth (Antony Sher), giving him a magic amulet. So Will does, with the utterly unsuitable Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), daughter of a self-made rich merchant.Viola loves the theatre and wants to act, which is a problem, since women are forbidden the stage (boys play the younger female parts). So she dresses as a boy and auditions for a part in the still unwritten new comedy with the working title 'Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.' As the relationship develops, Will's writer's block evaporates and a more familiar play emerges. History of course records that the play was a hit, but Will and Viola's fictional relationship hits heavy weather. Viola's father, anxious to improve his family's social standing, agrees to marry her off to the arrogant Earl of Wessex (Colin Firth), who needs the family money for a colonisation plan in Virginia. The final scene (Chesapeake Bay, it seems) connects England with America, and 'Romeo and Juliet' with Shakespeare's next play, 'Twelfth Night.'We see plenty of street life and squalor, meanness and mendacity, but also we get what can only be described as the healing power of art. Moneylenders and standover men are charmed by the power of theatre in at least temporarily suspending their business activities. The competition, in the form of Burbage (Martin Clunes, not behaving quite so badly here) comes to the rescue at a crucial point. Even Gloriana herself, Queen Elizabeth (Judi Dench), is moved by Will's story of true love.It's not too likely that Shakespeare scholars will consider this account of the origins of 'Romeo and Juliet' as plausible, but the writers, Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard, have produced something fresh out of the bones of history and their version is a lot of fun. At one point, QE 1 is faced with a large puddle between her and the coach she is boarding. She looks meaningfully at the assembled nobles who, no doubt mindful of Sir Walter Raleigh's previous gallantry and subsequent preferment, start fiddling with their cloaks. But they are too slow for Gloriana, who, losing patience, strides through the puddle, muttering 'too slow, too slow.'It's all pretty well done and the performances range from more than adequate to very good. Gwyneth Paltrow is not really a natural beauty (nor English) but she is both elegant and spirited as Viola (and very well dressed). When disguised (badly -only Will does not notice) as the boy actor she looks oddly like k. d. Lang and a great deal sexier. It is in this guise that Will first kisses her - a nice reference to the continuing pointless controversy over Shakespeare's sexuality. As Will, Joseph Fiennes and his big limpid eyes carry off the part of moonstruck lover well, though he is a bit young looking for 29. He is not so convincing in the 'genius at work' part of the role. Colin Firth is great as the nasty Wessex (Darcy without the redeeming qualities). Judi Dench does an effective Gloriana, even though some of her lines as written lacked punch (where's the famous charm?). There are a host of other good minor players, testament to the depth of talent in English Theatre despite the lousy conditions and poor pay for most of them.This isn't Shakespeare, and Norman and Stoppard didn't set out to emulate him, but they have produced, with John Madden's seamless directing, a fine entertainment which the Bard himself would have chuckled over. Stoppard, originally Czech and brought up largely outside Britain, has an outsider's perspective on the English language combined with a mastery of it, and this can produce a surreal effect - at times the dialogue is too self-consciously witty to be emotionally true. The whole thing may be a bit of a pastiche, but you won't notice the joins and it won't put you off Shakespeare, which is more than can be said for a lot of Eng Lit courses.",Null,1,2,27 February 1999
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Apatow lite
","About ten years ago romantic comedy started to merge with raunchy comedy Â– an early example was 'There's Something About Mary' after which I've never felt quite the same about hair gel. Judd Apatow as writer, producer and director has become a deft exponent of the resulting amalgam, though in this case he and the gang (Nicholas Stoller, director, Jason Segal, writer and lead actor, and others) have not been quite as deft as they were in 'Knocked Up', which had a semi-serious plot. Here we have Apatow lite. Peter (Jason Segal), a rather ineffectual, self absorbed composer of TV show music whose improbably glamorous girlfriend of five years, the eponymous Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), suddenly leaves him for Aldous (Russell Brand), an English rock star with a vast ego and voracious sexual appetite. Peter takes a vacation at the Turtle Bay resort in Oahu, Hawaii and guess who's there too? Yes, it's Sarah and Aldous, noisily in the next suite.Rachel (Mila Kunis), the gorgeous desk clerk at Turtle Bay, unaccountably takes an interest in Peter, who is overweight, depressed and generally unappetizing. But things bump along from there and there are plenty of funny scenes, before the denouement, which involves a rock opera production of Dracula using puppets.A number of the actors are from US television and handle the challenge of parodying their TV roles very well, Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis in particular. The absurdly pretentious Aldous is given some of the sharper lines, which has the effect of making the rest of the cast look pretty dumb. But the laughs keep coming. Like 'Seinfield', it is a comedy about nothing (almost) but the lines are good and the scenery is nice. Turtle Beach Resort will be happy. We didn't get to see turtles breeding though, despite them being 'in season'. Apatow and co are entertaining, if somewhat on the slight side, and the raunch is kept under control, despite Apatow's determination to remind us of the importance of the penis.",7,3,11,3 May 2008
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Rom-com with a few surprises
","As the movie opens Cal Weaver's humdrum but comfortable life as an accountant in Beverly Hills is rudely shattered by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore announcing in a crowded restaurant that she's being having an affair with a workmate and wants a divorce after 25 years marriage. Cal (Steve Carell) moves out and drops in to the single bars scene where for reasons not entirely clear ('you remind me of someone') lounge room Lothario Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who beds a different gorgeous woman each night takes Cal in hand and trains him to be just as successful. Meanwhile Cal's 13 old son Robby (Johna Bobo) has fallen in love with the family's babysitter, High School student Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who in turn has a crush on Cal. Then Jacob actually falls in love, with young lawyer Hanna (Emma Stone) and Emily starts to yearn for her discarded husband.This all sounds like a conventional romantic comedy of the feel-good variety, but directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa and writer Dan Fogelman have a few surprises up their sleeves. The performances are first-rate and the dialogue crackling. There is some reliance on slapstick but also some real emotion conveyed. Ryan Gosling's Jacob might perhaps be too shallow to be true ('you look like you've been photoshopped' says Emily, on seeing his torso), but it turns out that even he has a credible backstory. As the principal lovers, Steve Carell and Julianne Moore exhibit a realism seldom seen in romantic comedy and there is some fine comic work from Maresa Tomei as one of Cal's lounge bar conquests who pops up a bit closer to home. At 120 minutes the film is slow in places – I would describe the direction as quirky rather than slick (how else can one explain the cinematographer's penchant for shoe-level shots) but more rewarding than the average rom-com, and although the ending is contrived it's still satisfying.The directors, whose best known previous works, 'Bad Santa' and 'I Love You Phillip Morris' were decidedly quirky, have toned things down a bit here, but the characters are credible and sympathetic. I also liked the way the deep seated prudery and overdeveloped sense of decorum that afflicts middle class Americans are sent up. After an unseemly though perfectly understandable brawl in the Weaver's picture perfect back yard it falls to Vietnamese-American Officer Huang to tell the warring parties to do their fighting inside where the neighbours can't hear. I also liked Cal's line as he is rejected again by Emily outside Robbies' high school after a disastrous parent teacher interview and it starts to rain: 'This is such a cliché'. Well I suppose anyone going to see a rom-com ought to be prepared for clichés, but here they are cleverly handled, if a little sugar-coated.",Null,0,1,1 October 2011
Elizabeth," Sex, private lives and public careers
","Since Shakespeare's time, and probably before, the English public have mythologised their past through drama. Shakespeare had no trouble putting bums on seats at the 'Globe' with a series of historical dramas about English monarchs. Each was powered by the tension between the private feelings of the sovereign and the historical circumstances they had to deal with, some succeeding surfing the tide of history better than others, but all being portrayed as humans rather than gods.Shakespeare's formula, brilliant and simple, has been reworked by many others down through the years, and there have been many previous portrayals of Elizabeth R (reigned 1558-1603) on film. This one, for the 1990s, deals with her coming to power and the first 15 years of her reign. It is dark, sexy, a bit confusing, and ultimately gripping. Cate Blanchett as Elizabeth gives a riveting performance as she changes from high spirited young woman deeply in love with a slightly wet but half decent guy (Dudley) to ruthless professional virgin who must stay aloof to stay in power.The glories of the Elizabethan age were probably more the result of good wool prices that great government by Henry VIII's second daughter but she kept the peace domestically and managed (with the aid of the weather) to avoid foreign invasion. Like her great successor, Margaret Thatcher, she made some grievous errors but survived them all to die, alone, in bed in 1603.The other actors (I nearly said players) are all pretty good. Some are cast against type; compare Christopher Eccleston's full-on study in sex, power and religious fanatacism as the Duke of Norfolk with his feral accountant in 'Shallow Grave.' Geoffery Rush as Walshingham is ruthless also, but disguises it with sunny charm. Joseph Fiennes is suitably pretty as Dudley. Even soccer star Eric Cantona (he who thumps disorderly fans) puts in a quite believable performance as the French Ambassador.Shekhar Kapur's direction is very visual in style and sometimes is at odds with the script, but he has made good use of a largish budget and the whole thing is very satisfying to watch. If the costume people don't get an Oscar, there's no justice in this world. As for Cate, she has to be a starter for best actress. She doesn't put a foot wrong, and after seeing her in this role I can't remember what Glenda Jackson and Bette Davis looked like.",Null,0,0,25 October 1998
Billy Elliot," Dancing to escape
","It is nice to think that a miner's son can become a top ballet dancer, but the fact that it happens so seldom suggests it is not an easy transformation. `Billy Elliot' tells the story of a Durham miner's 11 year old son, who becomes enamoured of the dance while receiving boxing lessons. The local girls' core de ballet is training at the other end of the same gym and Billy decides the 50p for the boxing might be better spent on the ballet. The veteran teacher (Julie Walters) sees the boy is serious and puts much time into his lessons, even waiving the 50p fee when a horrified Dad finds out and cuts the money off. Dad is on strike  it is 1984, the time of the great confrontation between Mrs Thatcher and the miners. 
The story plays out against several themes skillfully interwoven into a compelling tale of pushing against the odds. A few things go Billy's way. Dad sees Billy tap dancing, realizes the kid really has talent, and switches from hostility to support. After all, aren't those Riverdance guys on the telly? So does Billy's older brother, already down the mine (and on strike). The teacher gets Billy an audition with the Royal Ballet School. The locals chip in to help finance the trip. But Billy is ferociously determined as well as talented and in the end of course he succeeds, shattering a few myths in the process. For one thing he discovers he is heterosexual, much to the dismay of a gay classmate (they remain friends). Coalminers can appreciate ballet too (Dad becomes a firm fan). And Mrs Thatcher did not necessarily beat the coal miners. It was just that they didn't win.Films like this (`The Full Monty, `Brassed Off `, `Educating Rita') celebrating the perils and potentialities of being working class, can be rather didactic (the films of Ken Loach come to mind), but this one is funny and uplifting. The kid playing Billy is stunningly good and well supported by Julie Walters, more restrained than usual, as the teacher, and the two playing Billy's father and brother. In fact all of the acting is great, including Patrick Malahide in a cameo as a delightfully snooty ballet auditioner. A group of 12 year old boys in the audience thought the film was great, judging by their comments during the film, and there were plenty of other smiling faces at the end. CAUTION:  POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEADFilm makers are right to be concerned with the plight of the workers and to be a bit angry, but a good story like this one transcends the political issues and uplifts us all. At the end  when the mature, accomplished and confident dancer leaps into the air as the prince in Swan Lake, we see no sign of the struggle, but only the Art, the lesson being that Art belongs to us all.",Null,0,0,13 November 2000
The Fifth Element," A pastiche, but with a sly humour of its own
","This is a great big fat comic book of a movie with characters to match (`Bruce Willis saves the World'). I watched it only because it was a slow Sunday night on TV, and the small screen and commercial breaks didn't help. But it has a cheeky charm, plenty of action, villainous villains (though the biggest villain is an unseen force) flamboyant sets (Brooklyn circa 2300 may be stolen from Fritz Lang's `Metropolis' but is nonetheless very impressive.) You can empathise with the heroine, reconstructed from a few cells, when she sees the city for the first time.I won't go into the logical inconsistencies in the plot; this is not a movie with a plot that bears much analysis. The future presented is more of the same, but worse, so that in 2300 people will still be going to Las Vegas style resorts, except that they will be in outer space. This does make you think why we bothered with space flight at all. Essentially this is a French film but with two unusual factors; a big Hollywood star, Bruce Willis, and a fairly big budget, $US90 million. (The film more than recovered its costs but did better in non-US markets). Its also a very personal film with Luc Bresson both directing and writing, and casting Mrs Bresson , the gorgeous Milla Jovovich, as the heroine (she does fit the bill nicely, dyed red hair and all).It is possible to trace almost every scene back to some earlier film or series. Apart from `Metropolis' there's the Egyptian scenes with John Bluthal and Luke Perry in the style of `Indiana Jones', the death star from `Star Wars', the casino battle with overtones of `Casino Royale', the snogging in the escape capsule reminiscent of James Bond  you name it, Bresson has taken it from somewhere. Not a great deal of acting is required in these circumstances, though Ian Holm makes the most of his opportunities as Vito the priest. Chris Tucker is appallingly over the top as DJ Ruby Rhod and I fervently hoped one of the minor monsters would blast him, but to no avail. Gary Oldman put in a ho-hum performance as the evil entrepreneur (called `Zorg' for heaven's sake), but was labouring under the handicap of being a villain without a motive. Why would he want the Earth to be blown up? Had he insured it with some Intergalactic Lloyds?This kind of cultural `borrowing' is quite common in French movies  all those French film noir films with Hollywood ancestry for example -  but usually the French contrive to put their own stamp on the finished product. This film is such a jumble, and so vague in its intentions it is impossible to regard it as more than a pastiche, though done with a certain amount of sly humour and plenty of resources. I think Gaumont were very lucky to get their money back.",Null,0,1,30 November 2003
Hot Fuzz," Hot film making
","This film, directed by Edgar Wright, is like an episode of 'Midsomer Murders' or some Agatha Christie story directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is, of course, a take-off of police procedurals and action movies in general with enough references to other films to keep the buffs up all night. The cutting is truly amazing and the pace never flags. It's pretty gory but somehow good-humoured.Sergeant Nick Angel (a wonderfully straight-faced Simon Pegg) is found to be so good at his job in the Metropolitan Police that he is an embarrassment, so his chief inspector (Bill Nighy) sends him to the country to cool his heels. He arrives in Sandford, Somerset (or thereabouts) and settles in well enough, but after a couple of suspicious deaths begins to realise that all is not well despite the surface calm. He teams up with one of the dimmer local cops and they investigate. Naturally the body count increases and it seems there is real evil about. The final shoot-out is something Clint Eastwood would be proud of.One thing 'Midsomer Murders', Poirot and the like share with this film is a great troupe of accomplished English character actors playing supporting roles. There's (rather surprisingly) Timothy Dalton, once a James Bond, playing a suspect supermarket owner, Anne Reid, Billie Whitelaw, Edward Woodward, and Stuart Wilson as other locals, Jim Broadbent as the avuncular Sandford police inspector and Martin Freeman, Steve Coogan and Bill Bailey (a double act) as various police persons. Even Peter Jackson the director is in there somewhere though I didn't spot him. But Simon Pegg, by staying so straight-laced throughout, makes the whole thing work. Nick Frost as his sidekick blends in well, though it is not such a demanding part.Obviously the movie was made by a bunch of young people having fun (their previous effort was 'Shaun of the Dead'). It might be bloody but there's not a dull moment, and the editing is worthy of a prize.",8,1,2,19 March 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Cowboy gone with the wind
","I wouldn't say I was blown away, but I was impressed. Basing the film on a short story by E Annie Proulx of 'Shipping News' fame, the accomplished Ang Lee has fashioned a picturesque absorbing and poignant, if rather slow, love story. The lovers happen to be two men, and cowboy society is not terribly tolerant towards 'queers', but ultimately it is a story about a love affair where neither party can make a total commitment. Both marry, have children, and yet go on their 'fishing trips' several times a year for 20 years. The central mystery is why don't they break away. The period of the film, 1963 to 1983, was the coming out decades for homosexuals in the US. Admittedly Wyoming was a backwater but to find other gays all you had to do was to get in the pickup and drive on some excellent roads to San Francisco. But Ennis and Jack somehow can't take the step.Perhaps it is the tough backgrounds both characters have. Jack Twist's home was remarkably austere though his 'American Gothic' parents, who we meet towards the end, seem loving in their stilted way. Ennis (an Irish name?) was orphaned as a child and brought up in a haphazard fashion by his brother and sister. It would be surprising if either had graduated from high school. Sheep herding is a minimum wage job (if you're lucky), though as it turns out later Jack does well as a tractor salesman.As Ennis, Heath Ledger, a local boy (all right, he's from Perth, WA) must be in for a chance at an Oscar, though they tend not to go to male actors early in their careers. E Annie herself is reported as saying that Heath went deeper into Ennis's character than she did. It was a pity about the mumbling (oh, not another Brando!) but we got the drift  this is one choked up character. He also handled the aging well  at the end it was hard not to accept he was 40. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack had more lines to play with and a less inscrutable character, but he also gives a fascinating performance. As the wives Alma and Lureen, Michelle Williams (the real Mrs Ledger) and Anne Hathaway (her real name!) do what is required. It is interesting that their reactions to the realization their husbands are gay are rather different. Alma, very much in love, is devastated, but Lurleen, who probably married Jack to get away from her bullying father, is prepared to live with it.Ang Lee exploits the scenery shamelessly (as it happens Canadian rather than US Rockies, though it seems the sheep were American)  he is a very visual director. Man's presence in such places, he seems to be saying, is on sufferance  the first snow storm is evidence of that. Poor Ennis and Jack are not even on sufferance  they must even pretend their relationship is a secret when everybody knows about it. Randy Quaid as Joe the rancher gives Jack a full blast of his homophobia, but only because their foolin' around might affect the sheep. Joe missed the obvious point  if Ennis and Jack were foolin' around with each other, that meant the sheep were pretty safe.",8,6,8,29 January 2006
Insomnia," No cure for Insomnia here
","This film is definitely not to be seen if you are suffering from insomnia, as the director Christopher Nolan, and Al Pacino do a great job of depicting the complaint. This is truly an example of daylight film noir, as one of our local critics put it. One does wonder whether a thicker set of curtains might have helped, but Al plays a man at the end of his tether in a number of respects. His career is in doubt, he has no personal life to speak of and he faces a bleak retirement. Yet he is tenacious in solving the case. His young local assistant, hero-worshiping him from afar gets to know some of the cost of being a good detective.Robin Williams plays the supercilious killer (we learn early on it is indeed him and the suspense lies in whether a case can be put against him). This character is really a literary conceit - most crims are not terribly smart- and a difficult part to realise effectively, but Williams, who is good at oddballs, plays him in a low-key, effective way. I usually find 'why I did it' scenes artificial, but here they seem to work.Hillary Swank as the young cop is all bright eyes and bushy tail but she fills the role admirably as the eager beaver who wants to learn from the great detective. She teams well with Pacino, who's seen it all and can't forget what he's seen.The landscape, darkly brooding, is a character also. Most of the film was filmed in British Columbia rather than Alaska where the story is set (though we do see a couple of Alaskan glaciers). Anyway, almost all of the inhabited parts of Alaska are below the Arctic circle and don't have the midnight sun, whereas Tromso, the setting of the original Norwegian film this is a remake of, is indeed above 66 degrees north. Not to worry, it seems it's not just the light that's preventing Al from sleeping.Christopher Nolan directs here in a much more straightforward fashion than he did in 'Memento', but he's good at menace and setting the movie on the frontier gives it an edge, at least for those who see the frontier as a scary place. In fact you are probably safer in the wilds of Alaska than the streets of LA. Not to worry. This is a very satisfactory thriller from the dark side, despite the perpetual daylight.",8,0,0,11 October 2002
Juno," Cheerful teen in trouble comedy
","Juno (Emily Page), a feisty High School junior in a modest Minnesota suburb, manages at 16 to get pregnant at her first try with boyfriend Beeker (Michael Cera). Abortion? Natch. Adoption? There's got to be some nice couple out there needing a baby. Sure, there is, Vanessa and Graham, the seemingly perfect Yuppie Couple who've advertised in the Pennysaver. Dad (JJ Simmons) and Step Mum Brenda (Allison Janney) are warmly supportive, but of course things don't quite go to plan.This film is of course the little movie that could, a US $3m movie that grossed $70 million in four weeks (alas, mostly for Rupert Murdoch's Fox Searchlight company). It caused quite a stir  just look at the message board on this website, there are 5000 posts at least. It's nice it is so popular because it's well-scripted (by first timer Diabolo Cody), well acted and generally cheerful to watch. At the same time it dodges the 'long term' issue  the effect on a birth mother of separation from her child, and for that matter the effect on the child.Emily Page, helped by the sparkling script, is terrific, and I really enjoyed Alison Janney ('CJ' in West Wing') as the definitely not wicked stepmother. Jason Reitman proved he can do quirky comedy in Thank You for Smoking and shows it again here. We might have teenage sexuality house trained but accidents are still going to happen. To me, adoption outside the family circle, noble as it may be, is 'second best' parenting, and should only be resorted to where there is no real alternative. As for abortion, well I'm pro-choice, but that includes saying no as well as yes.It's interesting that this movie was shot in British Columbia, with a Canadian actress in the lead. Maybe it was cheaper, or maybe it was to forestall pro-lifer demonstrators (who are not always as charming as the one in the film). Anyway, I wouldn't have thought pro-lifers will have anything to quarrel with here. The Academy won't either.",9,2,9,28 January 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Day after 3000AD, more likely
","I went along to see this movie with low expectations (`Independence Day' was asinine and `The Patriot' had all kinds of problems apart from Mel Gibson) but director Roland Emmerich is a versatile fellow, and this time he gets the special effects, computer graphics and stunt people to put on a great show. I loved the water foaming through the canyons of Manhattan (eerily reminiscent of the dust clouds of September 11th), the Russian freighter drifting past the New York Public Library (until it grounds on submerged vehicles), the LA twisters like busy vacuum cleaners and the snap-frozen effects. And of course poor old Statute of Liberty was very evocatively decorated with icicles, with an upended oil tanker there to remind us of our fatal addiction to fossil fuels. I was a bit miffed the director didn't take out our iconic Opera House, but I guess he's been there and done that.Unfortunately it is de rigeur in this kind of blockbuster to have a dumb plot, sometimes romantic (as in `Titanic') but usually of the rescue variety. It is not really possible for anyone to save the world here, so mild-mannered climate modeler Denis Quaid, about the only person in the world who knows what's happening, is allowed off to brave the New Jersey Turnpike in an SUV to rescue his 17 year old son Jake Gyllenhaal from the New York Public Library. He has to do the last 90 miles or so on foot, with two brave companions  Scott of the Antarctic stuff, although I don't think Captain Oates fell into an upmarket shopping mall anywhere in New Jersey. There is a really maudlin sub-plot involving Denis's doctor wife and a plucky little cancer sufferer which could easily have been deleted.As is often the case in spectaculars of this sort, the supporting characters get a chance to show they are much better actors than the leads. Ian Holm as the British climatologist and his two companions are examples, though Jake Gyllenhaal, if a bit old for 17 (he's 23), did manage a reasonably restrained and dignified performance. Denis Quaid was so low-key I had to keep reminding myself he was the hero. One thing about Charlie Heston, he never left you in any doubt about that.There is also a basic problem about the science here. Global Warning is the classic boiling frog example; because it is happening so slowly we are unaware of it, except through scientific observation. The suggestion put forward here is that the climate could be subject to an abrupt change through progressive melting of the polar icecaps producing cold fresh water which somehow interferes with the flow of warm ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream. I'm prepared to believe the inhabitants of low-lying Pacific atolls might be paddling in their huts in 50 years time, but snap- freezing the Northern Hemisphere in a few days is really stretching it. Weather is an extremely complex phenomenon and runs in patterns; abrupt changes in those patterns are unknown (barring meteorite strikes and volcanic eruptions). Previous ice ages have all had run-ups of thousands of years.Still, I'm sure Roland and the producers don't care  after all this is popular entertainment  and I did enjoy the Chaney like Vice President getting his comeuppance. There was also something rather droll about the US having to cancel Mexico's debt to permit the entry of US refugees to Mexico. Also, however wrong the science, the troglodyte Right who don't think Global Warming is a problem will be irritated beyond measure by the film. Ah, the power of the box office!",Null,0,0,6 June 2004
Match Point," Another ripley yarn?
","This movie is the latest from the distinguished British writer-director, Sir Woodford Allen. In a dark tale about an upwardly mobile young tennis pro who marries into an upper-class family while carrying on with his brother-in law's wayward fiancé, Sir Woodford, moving effortlessly through his natural milieu, expertly dissecting both the toffs and the pretenders. It can now be revealed that Sir Woodford is but a persona of that Dostoyevsky of the cinema, Woody Allen, who in fact has made a film which could be set almost anywhere. It seems the original script had New York and the Hamptons as locations, but the story plays just as well in London Paris, Sydney or Tokyo would have done just as well. It is wonderfully back grounded by some of the fruitier Italian Opera (especially Verdi)  the sound track is worth the price of admission alone.Chris, the tennis guy is played by the Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers. It is a remarkable performance, owing something to the early Malcolm McDowell ('Clockwork Orange 'and 'O Lucky Man'). It also reminded me of Patricia Highsmith's 'Ripley' (the character as played by Matt Damon not John Malkovich). It is an accomplishment to be able to radiate innocence while lying through your teeth, and Meyers does this beautifully, while keeping you guessing as to what he is really up to.Scarlett Johansson as his paramour Nola also puts in a powerful performance, even though her character is less mysterious. We can certainly feel the attraction - she is blond, beautiful and 'spirited'. Later, the magic fades, and we see her still handsome, but just another bad-tempered failed actress. This of course is what Chris sees also.The family Chris has married into rather reminded me of something a British real estate agent said about the English Aristocracy  'deeply ordinary people mainly interested in country pursuits'. Wife Chloe (Emily Mortimer) just wants to breed, Mother in law Eleanor (Penelope Wilton) is disapproving and Father in law Alec Hewitt (Brian Cox) just wants to help. Dim brother in law Tom (Matthew Goode) just wants to improve his serve. I can only assume Alec inherited his money  he shows no sign of the abilities required to make it. Still, all this makes the Hewitts the perfect set of milch cows for Chris, who has all the qualities required for success in the dog-eat-dog world of high finance.Woody, or is it Sir Woodford, clearly wants to remind us of the role of chance in human affairs and indeed you could say chance determines the outcome here. But with all respect to Sir Woody, the forces of nature, and Chris is one of those, have a habit of prevailing despite the fall of the dice. Don't get me wrong  this is great entertainment, but it wouldn't do to take it seriously. In the real world, it is more likely that the competent Detective Banner would have been examined the matter more closely. After all, James Nesbitt usually plays coppers who get their man.",8,0,1,12 March 2006
Midnight in Paris," Love outflanks Nostalgia
","This was a movie both frivolous and serious – a profound fantasy. You might say a typical Woody Allen movie, but this one is one of his better attempts at serio-romantic comedy. Gil (Owen Wilson) is a Woody Allen avatar as he explores two themes, nostalgia and the meaning of love. Gil, a Hollywood screen writer who hankers to be a novelist is engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdam) but when they go to Paris with her parents Gil starts having doubts, fuelled by contact with various famous literary figures of Paris in the 20's who magically appear to Gil as he walks the streets after midnight. F Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Cole Porter (Yves Heck), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and numerous others all put in an appearance, most of them surprisingly ready to help Gil with his novel and his love life.Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief here – but the portrayals of these figures by various actors, though uneven, mostly ring true. Gil may well have been dreaming but he finds that the 'golden age' of Paris in the twenties is not necessarily better than today – 'nostalgia ain't what it used to be', and that love is what conquers death.Owen Wilson fits the Woody character like a glove, though Woody is not really a Hollywood hack writer. He is complemented by Marion Cotillard as Adriana, his guide through the twenties, from whom he learns about love.There is a lot of fun along the way, and some minor characters to keep us entertained such as Paul (Michael Sheen) a know-all friend of the couple and a celebrity museum guide (Carla Bruni – President Sarkozy's spouse). Paris is also a character, photogenic, and presented in strong light for the day bits and warm yellow tones after dark. The film will certainly not discourage tourism there, at least at the deluxe end of the market – the hotels are 5 star and limos are everywhere. The scripts sparkles - Woody seeks to entertain as well as philosophise - and here he succeeds at both.",9,0,1,10 December 2011
A Bridge Too Far," War movie of the traditional sort
","Film Review: 'A Bridge Too Far' (Seen Nov 2008)In the 1950s and early 1960s it seemed that almost every second movie was about the Second World War, but by the time this one, the story of the unsuccessful Allied attempt to outflank the Germans and secure the Rhine bridges in August 1944, was made (mid 70s) interest had waned somewhat and this movie was not a box office success, unlike 'The Longest Day', the story of the D-Day invasion in 1944. from the same writers.The basic structure used here is a number of interweaving stories; we see the action from the point of view of the top brass, the field commanders, the ordinary soldiers, and the civilians caught up in the battle. Almost all of this is from the allied point of view, though there are some scenes with the German high command (Hardy Kruger and Maximillian Schnell) which are inexplicably in German, with no sub-titles (I watched the film on Turner Classic Movies in Budapest). We viewers of course have the benefit of hindsight, but it has to be said that the British generals involved, especially General Browning (Dirk Bogarde), were over-confident in what was a very risky operation. The Americans, (embodied in Ryan O'Neal, a ridiculously young general) and the British field commanders (Michael Caine, Sean Connery and Antony Hopkins were more realistic. The weather held back Polish reinforcements (improbably commanded by Gene Hackman), the operation's plans fell into the hands of the Germans (who initially thought they were a ruse), the radios were defective, and the Allied intelligence as to the location of German tanks was also defective. The film succeeds as a spectacle. There are plenty of big bangs, bullets and so forth, and the devastation of modern warfare graphically illustrated. There are so many big-name actors one has a hard time remembering them all, though some are unmissable, such as Laurence Olivier as a Dutch doctor. It is of course the story of an allied defeat, but in some ways more interesting than if the operation had succeeded (by this time in 1944 an Allied victory in Europe was in sight and only significant German thrust occurred afterwards the 'Battle of the Bulge' in the Ardennes in late 1944). One learns more from failure than success. Somehow the Polish commander got the blame for the failure, though General Browning was sidelined afterwards as well.At the end of the day a war movie is a war movie. This is not 'Apocalypse Now' but is above average for the genre. If it had been made in the 1960s it would have been acclaimed, but by the late 70s our view of war had changed, as the success of 'Apocalypse' demonstrated.",7,1,2,7 December 2008
Zodiac," Smart Killer, dumb cops
","In this part of the world 'Zodiac' conjures up memories of the old Ford model Dad drove in the 1950s, but in the Bay area of San Francisco, it is still a name to send a shiver down your spine. The Zodiac was a serial killer of the 1960s and 1970s who specialised in attacking courting couples and sending cryptic (and not so cryptic) notes to the local newspapers. He was never caught, despite two of his victims surviving to identify suspects and despite a mountain of circumstantial evidence against one particular suspect, Arthur Leigh Allen.This film, based on Robert Graysmith's books, is a combination of the police procedural with newsroom drama a la 'All the President's Men'. The police efforts to find the killer, led by Detective Toschi (an excellent Mark Ruffalo) are complemented firstly by the San Francisco Chronicle's Paul Meyer (Robert Downey, cast yet again as a talented drunk) and then by the paper's cartoonist, Robert Graysmith, who becomes more and more obsessed by the case. Graysmith, also excellently played by Jake Gyllenhaal, eventually persuades Toschi to re-examine the evidence. As the tagline rightly has it, the film is about the effect the Zodiac had on his pursuers as well as on the crimes and the investigation. Chasing the Zodiac was not a great career move for Toschi, Meyer and Graysmith. Nor was it good for Meyer's health or Graysmith's personal life. But the main focus is on the hunt, and it's a long and tangled tale. The police were almost unbelievably incompetent, though this is rather soft-pedalled in the film. For further reading on this see the chapter 'This is the Zodiac Speaking' in Richard Belfield's 'Can You Crack the Enigma Code' (2006).However it is made clear in the film that the several police forces involved routinely kept pertinent information to themselves instead of sharing it. Graysmith comes up with a prime suspect, Allen (spookily played by John Carroll Lynch), From the little I know about this case, the director has exercised some dramatic licence  this is drama rather than documentary. Thus, while it's true that a suburban couple were able to crack the Zodiac's cryptogram where the FBI and CIA failed, some of the Zodiac's later coded messages were never cracked. Graysmith's visit to the hardware store to confront Allen didn't occur. What did happen, according to Belfield, was that an FBI agent in the mid-1970s brought one of the surviving victims, Bryan Hartnell, to surreptitiously identify Allen as the killer at the hardware store he worked at. Another survivor, Mike Mageau, identified Allen from photographs in 1992, but as you will see from the text at the film's end the police had run out of time.This film is well acted and nicely photographed, but, like the real investigation, long and meandering, with several story lines becoming dead ends. If I were Governor Schwarzenegger I'd have an enquiry into the California police forces  there's clearly a major public administration problem there. I sometimes despair of the proficiency of the large and fairly professional NSW police force, but having a whole lot of little bailiwicks which don't talk to each other is ridiculous.",8,0,1,14 June 2007
Milk," History brought alive.
","Despite its theme, this is a pretty straight movie  a straightforward biopic, that is, from Gus Van Sant, a director with a varied bag of credits. It is also a thoroughly satisfying piece of work. It is not just Sean Penn's energetic Oscar winning performance  he did something similar as a Huey Long-type demagogue in a re-make of 'All The King's Men' a few years ago which was a complete flop. The supporting characters are well drawn and the dynamic atmosphere of San Francisco in the 70s is beautifully evoked. Similar things happened in other big cities around the world in the same period, not the least here in Sydney, but the San Francisco story was given special poignancy because of Milk's eventual assassination.That's not a spoiler by the way, since it's pretty clear from the start what's going to happen. Harvey didn't want to die in the cause of gay liberation, but he was prepared to. His nemesis, ex-policeman Dan White, nicely played by Josh Brolin, is motivated by jealousy as much as anything else. He is a dull underachiever who has gravitated into politics after failing elsewhere  the anti-gay ideology merely a convenient posture. The result of the California-wide poll on the anti-gay proposition 6 in 1978 indicates that White got it wrong  most Californians were not as homophobic as he thought. Milk himself thought White was probably a closet case.While the film gives a pretty positive picture, it does not shy away from Milk's shortcomings. A volatile and emotional man, Harvey found it hard to advance his political career and maintain his personal relationships at the same time. After the third or fourth unsuccessful campaign, Scott Smith (James Franco), his long time lover, walked out, and his next partner Jack Lira (Diego Luna), admittedly unstable, committed suicide. But Harvey plugged on, and had he lived, given the peculiar demographics of San Francisco, might well have become mayor. True, there was the inevitable conservative backlash, but 30 years on we can see a vast improvement in the status of gay people in most first world countries. This is a fine film and a fitting tribute to someone who indeed made a difference. The Oscar winning1984 documentary 'The Times of Harvey Milk' told the story, but this film brings Harvey to life again.",9,1,4,24 February 2009
The Prestige," Less adventurous than Memento, but plenty of fun
","'Step right up folks, for the next entertaining and annoying confection from the clever Nolan brothers, who make a perfectly credible plot disappear before your very eyes and send you out of the theatre with a warm glow but also with a vague feeling you've been had.' Actually I think my anonymous sideshow barker is being a bit harsh, for this particular confection, viewed as sheer entertainment, has a lot going for it. . First, there are two strong performances from Hugh Jackman, and Christian Bale as the two dueling magicians (or is it illusionists?), Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Then there's a faultless supporting performance as Michael Caine, in wise old buffer mode, as Cutter, the trick deviser. Then there's the invocation of the late Victorian/Edwardian atmosphere, when society seemed to be so straitlaced and stratified, yet unimaginable change was already on its way. Lastly, there's the paradox that even though, especially via Cutter, we get to see the magic business from the inside, what's really going on is concealed until the end  and possibly beyond.This is a long movie - over 120 minutes and I did get a little restless at times. The intensity of the rivalry between the male leads tends to put their women in the shade, and Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall were rather overshadowed (though Rebecca does the better of the two). Although the Tesla sub-plot was interesting, and David Bowie was a suitably cagey Tesla (the real-life electrical inventor), the leap into rather fuzzy sci-fi was rather out of sympathy with the main themes of the picture, putting on illusions and getting revenge. Still without Tesla there would not have been Andy Serkis's gem of a performance as his sidekick Alley.As in 'Memento' where the story was essentially presented backwards, Christopher Nolan plays around with the time-frame, but much more conventionally. Thus the movie opens with Borden in jail after being convicted of Angier's murder, but of course that is not the end of the story. The storyline is not a challenge until the end when rather too much is revealed at once. Still, the stars are easy to watch and the music-hall atmosphere beautifully evoked. Whether or not Tesla could do remarkable things with black cats and top hats, not to mention people, is beside the point; the story here is powered by good old human passion.",8,0,0,25 November 2006
Once," A musical for people who can't afford musicals
","This is a pleasant if slightly poignant love story about two people whose bond is music rather than lust. It's also one of the cheapest musicals ever made. Guy (Glen Hansard from the band Frame) is Irish, a repairer of Hoovers (vacuum cleaners) who busks with his guitar and voice in Dublin shopping streets in his spare time, nursing the hurt caused by his ex-girlfriend who has left him and gone to London. Girl (Marketa Irglova) is a young mother who has left her husband and her country, the Czech Republic, to seek a better life in Ireland (the film is set a few years back before Ireland became top of the GDP per head pops). Both are writers as much as performers and it is not long before they are recording their own stuff. She clearly likes him, but she rebuffs his advances. No matter, because they make beautiful music together.For a movie without a great deal of dramatic tension (it is almost documentary-like at time) it is remarkably absorbing. The music is what you'd expect  sentimental pop, but not pap, and generally easy listening. There's not a nasty person in the film, save perhaps for a heroin addict who tries to rip off Guy in the opening frames. The hand-held camera gives immediacy  you might almost be walking down a crowded Grafton St, where this correspondent's grandfather used to ply his trade as a high class Ladies' Draper (Newell's of Dublin, a site now occupied by the more downmarket Dunne's). Glen Hansard is not an actor by profession (though he had a small part in 'The Commitments' 15 years ago) but he's fine here, with the right amount of anguish for Guy. Marketa Irglova is just brilliant as the Girl. Casting often means young actors have to appear younger than they actually are, but here Irglova at 17 manages to convince us she is in her mid-twenties, as well as writing and playing a good deal of the music.This movie was shot in 17 days in and around Dublin and cost about $US 150,000. Much of the music is original and the performers are mostly musicians, not actors. It's a slight piece but it holds together well despite the lack of dramatic tension. You come out of the theatre in a cheerful frame of mind. Perhaps it does help if you like folk-pop music but this is pleasant, accessible stuff. I'd like to think that Granddad wouldn't have rung the Garda to have them moved on.",9,3,5,23 September 2007
Crash," Haggis finds multi plotting a tricky business
","'Multi plotting', in which a group of often disparate characters with their own story lines meet and intermingle, has been a popular film format since at least 'Grand Hotel' in 1932. Robert Altman, who was given a special Oscar in 2006 has used this technique to good effect in several of his movies, starting with 'Nashville' (1976) and another recent successful exponent was Paul Thomas Anderson in 'Magnolia'. It's an effective technique but requires a lot of skill to make it work. It has a tendency to put an emotional distance between the audience and the characters, making it harder for viewers to identify with them, and one can finish up feeling one is just observing pond life through a microscope.In this film, writer/director Paul Haggis, a very experienced TV producer, gives us some well-rounded characters, such as Don Cheadle's amiable black detective, but others, if not cardboard cut-outs are rather flat, such as Sandra Bullock's angry housewife Jean, and her slimy District Attorney husband Rick (Brendan Fraser). Other characters are shameless exercises in audience manipulation, for example Matt Dillon's very well acted white racist LAPD operative who after behaving very badly towards a middle-class couple, saves the wife from a fiery death. Just to press the point home we also discover he is an attentive son to his ailing elderly father (and engaged in a battle over Dad's health insurance cover with an unsympathetic black bureaucrat).It was difficult to have much sympathy for the Iranian storeowner who was unable to recognise that he, and not the latino locksmith was responsible for making the store easier to burgle. Maybe we would understand him better if we knew, say, that he used to work for the Shah's secret police. There is plenty of tension when he confronts the locksmith with a gun, but once again our emotions are manipulated (via the locksmith's daughter).Again, the black car-jacking desperados are such obvious dickheads it is difficult to empathise with them also, but the story line is manipulated in such a way as to put them in a different light.It has to be said most of the acting is first-rate and the story lines are well handled, though there are some loose ends. It was only right at the end I realised that after the first scene (at the crash  no more than a fender bender) that the whole film is in flashback  frankly I thought that was too tricky. Oscar material? Really, no. I haven't seen 'Munich' but 'Brokeback Mountain', 'Capote' and 'Goodnight and Good Luck' are all superior in their different ways. So how did it win? Well, more than half the academy live in the LA area and obviously thought the film told it how it is, or how it feels to be an Angelino. As an outsider though, I am at the other end of the microscope.",7,0,2,13 March 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Still a blast after all those years
","Those of us who grew up during the cold war have reason to thank Stanley Kubrick, who had the brilliant insight that the only way to stay sane in the face of nuclear annihilation was to laugh at the absurdity of it all. He started out with Peter George's serious 'what would happen if.' novel 'Red Alert' and produced with the aid of some very fine actors a black comedy you'd have to be psychotic not to understand.Seeing it again after many years, I was conscious of how my focus had changed. As a schoolkid who had recently experienced the Cuban missile crisis, I concentrated firmly on the laughs: 'You can't fight here, this is the War Room,' 'Precious bodily fluids', 'You're going to have to answer to the Coca Cola company' and the slapstick: 'Mein Fuerher, I can valk!' Now I can see how deadly accurate the comedy was, and how well the film was made, with only four or five sets and minimalist back projection for the aerial shots. The War Room itself, huge, bare, efficient and  enclosed, is a great metaphor for the military mind. Kubrick, by highlighting the heroism of the bomber crew, sends up wonderfully the laudatory war movie which was very much in evidence at the time ('The Dambusters,' 'Reach for the Sky' etc). The Strangelove character is a bit of an 'add on' but I don't agree that the final War Room scene, in which Strangelove outlines his plan for a post nuclear underground brothel/breeding farm for the Chosen Ones, is redundant. As long as the bastards running the world think they might personally escape a nuclear holocaust the rest of us are at greater risk. There was something to be said for 'Mutually Assured Destruction' or MAD.The acting performances are all definitive and we are lucky Peter Sellers did not do Major Kong, thus depriving us of Slim Picken's heroic cowboy pilot who, against all the odds, reaches a target and rides the bomb right to the ground. George C Scott, only 40 at the time, as General Buck Turgidson is a sort of proto-Patton on speed, alternately petulant, sly, mystical, gung-ho and evasive. Peter Sellers rises to the challenge of making a couple of 'normal' characters, the President and Group Captain Mandrake, interesting (Strangelove is pure vaudeville) and Sterling Hayden, helped by camera angles, made it clear that no-one was going to convince General Jack D Ripper he was wrong about fluoridation. (The problem about Col. 'Bat' Guano (Keenan Wynn), he with the hatred for 'preverts' and the solicitude for the fixtures of the Coca Cola Company is that there are too many people like that in the real world  for such a character to be very funny.)The Kubrick touch is evident in the detail as usual. In Washington the phone in Gneral Turgidson's bedroom is answered by his secretary and mistress, Miss Scott (Tracey Reed). In the pilot's seat on board the B-52 overflying Russia, Major Kong is discovered ogling the centerfold of 'Playboy' and this month's Pet is, naturally, Miss Scott.It's all a bit over the top, but for once that helps. There's a lot of talk and techno-babble and the pace is not particularly fast. The world goes down the gurgler at a stately pace and there's not a damned thing anyone can do about it. All the procedures designed to stop such a disaster happening are gone through, but found to be ineffective. One of them turns out to have provided General Ripper with his opportunity to get the Russians first before they pollute his precious bodily fluids.It's interesting to compare 'Dr Strangelove' with 'Failsafe,' another movie on the same theme (but from a different book) which played it as straight drama. 'Failsafe' with Henry Fonda as the hero president from central casting, was a well made movie, nothing more. 'Dr Strangelove' is art in the cause of humanity.",Null,1,2,20 December 1999
Pan's Labyrinth," A Spanish fantasy for all
","I've not seen any of Guillermo del Toro's earlier films, but this one places him, along with Alejandro González Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuaron, as a Spanish-American film-maker with broad appeal. This film (unlike 'Babel') sticks within one very specific cultural milieu, Franco's Spain in 1944 seen through the eyes of Ofelia, an 11 year old girl whose widowed mother has been desperate enough to marry a particularly zealous and nasty fascist army officer. Not surprisingly she escapes into her own world of fantasy, in which she is a princess of the underworld trying to find her way home.The film is stacked full of good performances. Ivana Banquero, is stunning as Ofelia, and Sergi Lopez is completely convincing as her ruthless and single-minded stepfather, Captain Vidal. Maribel Verdu as Mercedes the housekeeper also puts in a strong performance, as does Alex Angulo as the doctor and Doug Jones as Pan and the Pale Man (aided by some terrific costume design).It is interesting that while the fascists are portrayed as the bad guys del Toro makes an attempt to explain what drives them. In one dinner scene the local notables are entertained by Vidal to a sumptuous feast (while everyone around is on strict rations). After the third or so round of drinks he announces that all men are not equal, 'we won the war and therefore deserve the best.' His listeners (except for the doctor) enthusiastically agree. Vidal, desperate for a son, is also motivated by tradition; his father was an army general who died in battle, for Vidal 'the only way to die'. But he is also a sadist  his interrogations go long past mere military brutality. Perhaps the message is you don't have to be a sadist to be a good fascist, but it helps.The resistance are of course portrayed as the good guys, but their tactics are as brutal as those of the military, shooting the wounded where they fall, for example. They also find it hard to accept that the war is over, and they are merely the subject of a mopping-up operation headed up by a real bastard very happy in his work.Most of the action takes place in a gloomy and surprisingly wet forest so well evoked we can almost smell the mud. The fantasy sequences owe something to Lewis Carroll as well as Mervyn Peake - 'Alice in Wonderland' meets 'Gormenghast' (Pan has a little in common with the White Rabbit). Visually, this is a terrific film.The good guys did win out in the end, but it took another 30 years, and happened peacefully. The speed at which Spain has left its fascist past behind tells us something, I think.",9,7,13,10 February 2007
The Way Back," A beautiful but very long walk
","The story of a small group of people escaping from a Siberian Soviet prison, part of the 'Gulag' in wartime and walking 4000 miles to freedom looked a trifle grim in the trailer, but Peter Weir has managed to produce a rather beautiful film out of it, using Bulgaria and Morocco as locales rather than Siberia and the Gobi desert. Only Darjeeling in India plays itself. My only trouble with it is the rather uneven character development. The story lends itself to ensemble playing but we learn little about two or three of the walkers. In the case of the lead character Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who is the source of the story this is explicable as we are seeing the others though his eyes, but it has to be said that both 'Mr Smith' (the excellent Ed Harris) and the Girl (Saiorse Ronan) leave a lasting impression.I know there is some doubt as to the authenticity of the story, taken from a 1955 book by Slavimir Rawicz a former Polish army officer, and indeed what the group are supposed to have done looks impossible but that's not a problem, because the relationships ring true. It is remarkable how an almost random collection of individuals, including one with a very unsavoury past, can, driven by sheer necessity, wind up functioning as a team. Partly this is due to the leader actually having some navigational knowledge and therefore inspiring confidence in the others. Mr Smith remarks early on that the Janusz has a serious weakness; he is kind, but when the chips are down we see that even the hard-bitten Mr Smith is capable of compassion.Strangely enough, after the initial scenes in the prison camp, and the escape, there is not a lot of drama. The group encounter very few people on their travels and those they do meet take little interest in them (perhaps they had not heard about the bounty for escapees). Obtaining food and water is obviously a big issue, so mind out for the messy hunting scenes. I was astounded at how well their footwear stood up to the punishment; my hiking boots are not good for 400 miles let alone 4000. Actually they must have wandered around a bit - the northern end of Lake Baikal and Lhasa in Tibet are about 1800 miles apart, though the prison camp was somewhere north of the lake. It's also not clear how long the walk took, but at times it seemed like years. Weir's great achievement is to keep us watching a very drawn out tale. Personally I think I would have died of boredom if I had been in this particular walk, if starvation hadn't got me first.",8,65,86,1 March 2011
Knocked Up," Warm-hearted comedy
","A warm-hearted and good-natured romantic comedy with just enough off-beat moments to keep the viewer entertained. Rather long and occasionally in your face (a moment of crowning glory in fact) but so suffused with family values so as to placate the most disapproving moralist. It's nice to see the leading man as an overweight slob, but the morality of the piece means that his love affair with the beautiful subject of his one night stand will bring out his better aspects. The American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists might take umbrage at the portrayal of some of their members but it is hard too see anyone else being offended by this movie.",8,0,2,21 July 2007
Closer," Too close, maybe
","This is a film that hasn't really left the theatre, from whence it came. The original author, Patrick Marber, a hot young British playwright of the 90s, produced an intense theatrical sexual shocker and his participation in the screenplay has ensured that the intensity, confronting dialogue and angry characters remain. There are still only four speaking parts and the twelve scenes (with flashbacks) of the original have been retained. Marber has however toned down the ending, with little effect on the overall impact of the piece. It is a powerful statement on the ability of apparently civilized and cultivated persons to screw up their personal relationships via sexual adventurism.When we first see him Dan the obituary writer (Jude Law), who takes the dazed Alice (Natalie Portman) under his wing, seems like a thoroughly nice guy. A year later, when he shows up at Anna's photographic studio, for a book dustcover photo, he's almost a different person, vain, overconfident and promiscuous. He plays an elaborate practical joke via an internet sex chat room (the most entertaining sequence in the film) and becomes the means whereby Anna (Julia Roberts) meets Larry (Clive Owen), the dermatologist with attitude. The subsequent tangles between the four of them involve a great deal of deceit, manipulation and emotional bullying (though all four never appear in the same scene). Larry in particular, the alpha male, is good at getting his way, though Anne suffers greatly as a result.I'm not going to complain about the acting. I was pretty impressed with Clive Owen, previously seen mainly in detective-type parts. He played the Dan role in the original National Theatre stage production of 1997, and has no trouble with the more robust part of Larry in the film. Natalie Portman is practically faultless as a contradiction in terms, a naïve stripper. Actually, she turns out not to be so naïve, note the name in her passport, revealed towards the end. Julia Roberts acquits herself well in a less difficult part. Jude Law as Dan has a strange personality change part way through as mentioned but manages to make him more sympathetic towards the end.People have compared this film to 'Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf' and Carnal Knowledge' both directed by Mike Nichols more than 30 years ago. The dialogue is certainly witty at times and the themes of love, sex and betrayal are certainly similar, but the characters here are even harder to like than those of George and Martha in 'Woolf' and the Nicolson/Garfinkel characters in 'Carnal Knowledge'. There really is a problem when the audience has the shock of non-recognition, that is it says 'I could never do that. Even if I'd like to.'",7,0,1,27 February 2005
Capote," The Consequences of cold-blooded lying
","Some claim that pianists are human. And cite the case of Mr TrumanOgden Nash, 'Carnival of the Animals'Truman Capote was not named after the piano-playing former US president, but you have to acknowledge he was human. Unfortunately, his humanity got in the way of his ambition and ego, a clash which eventually destroyed him as an artist and as a person. At least, that is the story told here, but given his propensity for the bottle he may well have finished up an alcoholic wreck even if he had never met the killers Perry Smith and Richard Hickock and not written 'In Cold Blood', which is one of the finest accounts of a crime and its aftermath in the English language. The remarkable feature of Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as Capote (the Oscar is a certainty) is the way it projects the inner conflict between Capote's near-love for Perry and the need to get the work done, even if that means Perry getting strung up. Hoffman makes it clear that Capote, having decided the work was more important than the relationship, then, because he was human, could not live with the consequences. The bottle beckoned, and that was it. It is also made clear in the live reading of part of the book before a New York audience that a truly brilliant work resulted. Dan Futterman's script, though loaded with Capote's own words, leaves enough room for Hoffman to use non-verbal ways of expressing his character's emotions. Capote was also a born liar, and like all good liars was great at sincerity. Hoffman carries this off beautifully. Sometimes you wonder whether Capote was a fantasist who believed his own lies but on reflection it seems more likely he was a ruthless realist, lying without compunction if it suited his purpose. Sadly, he could not live with the result. A moral tale indeed.",9,1,1,26 February 2006
Lost in Translation," Found, a cute little love story
","I thought this was a low-key character-driven drama with a humorous overtone which involved two Americans who just happened to meet in a luxury Tokyo hotel. Bill Murray as the declining film star and Scarlett Johansson as the young woman with the world at her feet and no idea what to do with it are believable and sympathetic (especially compared, say, with their spouses). Japan and the Japanese are merely the background, and really only have the function of emphasising the character's isolation. It could equally have been set in Zurich, or Auckland Hence I find the attack on the film as anti-Japanese as quite irrelevant. Much of the film takes place in the confines of the Tokyo Park Hyatt, which is about as Japanese an institution as McDonalds. I did think the call-girl ordered up by Bill's hosts (a whisky manufacturer) pretty funny though, not because she was Japanese, but because of their different expectations.Sofia Coppola is good at teasing out nuances in her characters (see eg `Virgin Suicides'), and Bill Murray has never been better in showing the sad side of a comic. Scarlett, as the confused Yale philosophy major, got the tone just right. The story itself doesn't amount to a lot, but we understand them well enough at the end. This is not a film for everyone, so if you must have at least three car crashes before the opening credits, don't go. But if you don't mind a meandering approach to affairs of the heart, it's OK.",Null,0,1,17 February 2004
Full Metal Jacket," A split personality movie
","Those who say this is two movies are right. The first 40 minutes set in the US Marines boot camp amount to an almost perfect short film on the boot camp theme of bastardisation to produce trained killers. The story is perfectly balanced, the three central characters beautifully and economically drawn, the whole thing as clean and as austere as the marine's barracks. The drill sergeant is not a monster, just the hard man the job requires, though we only ever see him on duty. I had to remind myself that anyone serving in the marines has volunteered to be there, so perhaps one should not feel too sorry for the recruits. The sexual element seems to be laid in rather thick - this is one very imaginatively foul-mouthed instructor - but I suppose one way to unite men and give them a sense of purpose is to get them to despise women.The remaining hour or so, set in Vietnam, during the Tet Offensive in 1968, is rather more problematical. It's three years later and Joker the journalist, far from killing people as he was taught to do in boot camp, is in Da Nang filing reassuring copy for the ultimate house journal, the US Army's Stars and Stripes. He gets sent up country to cover the action with a photographer and is dragged in to action in a patrol commanded by an old friend from boot camp. Here he discovers hellish things do happen in war, even to principled people such as himself.This second part is a kind of slide into the pit, and rather dismaying to watch. The atmosphere is like `Apocalypse Now' but without the personal journey of Charlie Sheen's character Willard. Kubrick and his set people do a good job re-creating Vietnam in Berkshire, but the limitations are obvious - at times it's like watching a theatrical set. But my biggest beef is that here Stanley K has nothing really new to say. Perhaps he forgot he had already made a definitive war movies 30 years earlier in `Paths of Glory' His mad officers are nothing new and have little impact here. `The Thin Red Line' did a much better job of capturing the dynamics of combat units (in Guadalcanal) and `Apocalyse Now' really stuck the madness of war to the audience. And `Saving Private Ryan', for all its deficiencies, puts the viewer in the front line far more effectively.As the drill sergeant, Lee Ermey ( a former marine drill sergeant and accomplished actor), gives a flawless performance and Vincent D'Onisforu as the unlucky Pyle is a perfect quivering heap. Matthew Modine is only adequate as Joker though he finishes well.Perhaps Kubrick was too static a director to make a really convincing action movie, but he has to be given credit for the first 40 minutes, the finest rendering of military bastardisation put on film.",Null,1,2,31 March 2004
The Devil Wears Prada," Farce for fashionistas
","I have to admit not knowing anything about Prada, or high fashion, for that matter. The two sections I skip over in newspapers with hardly a glance are sport and fashion. This film is a light-hearted romp about people I couldn't care less about. Actually , that's not quite true because I always sympathise with fresh young people trying to start their careers, and of course Ann Hathaway's character Amy is serious minded enough; she takes the job as Miranda Priestly's assistant and general dogsbody because it might help her get a more serious journalistic job elsewhere. Meryl Streep's Miranda is a hard-driving egocentric monster with just enough charm to prevent her being totally repulsive. People like that, frankly, are to be avoided, especially as bosses. Amy puts everything into the task of appeasing Miranda, even to the extent of endangering her relationship with her nice boyfriend. But she survives, and gets a good reference from the elegant monster.One interesting point about the Mirandas of this world is the way they bring out the worst in others. Collegiality at work is sacrificed and everyone competes to satisfy the boss's whims. It's not obvious that this leads to a better product; in fact if there's no-one around prepared to tell the boss that her brilliant plans have flaws, disaster is more likely. It's also very wearing dealing with all the unnecessary tension that arises. There's nothing creative about it. Some bosses cultivate fear and uncertainty among their employees (Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black come to mind), but the usual long-term result is that the good people leave and the organization teeters towards collapse.The reason why people put up with the Mirandas of this world is of course money. If you can put up with the constant stress and humiliation, you do get to live the high life. But, as Amy, a sensible person, soon realizes, it's not a long term proposition.It was nice to see an only slightly camp Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Amy's fashion mentor, and Emily Blunt as Emily, Miranda's other assistant is a good foil to Amy's faux pas. Adrian Greiner is cute as Emily's boyfriend Nate, but there aren't any evident signs of acting. Meryl, of course, can do this sort of thing in her sleep, but she puts plenty of panache into her part. You're not likely to fall asleep while she is on the screen.",5,0,0,22 February 2009
Bridget Jones's Diary," a comment from the Original Author
","It is a truth universally acknowledged among publishers that a lady novelist who has written a fetching tale is anxious to see a theatrical production made of it. My prior experience of approaches by young men and women of large fortune who wish to adapt my humble accounts of county life for the kinemascope have left me with a mixture of emotions: pride, surprise, anger, outrage and dismay. Thus I must own to be prejudiced against such adaptions, for they concentrate on the charms of the scenery and the countenances of my characters rather than on what I may call their inner beauty.  Alas I can do nought, since my copyrights have well and truly expired.The present is an attempt to transplant my youthful experiment, `Pride and Prejudice,' written when I was of 18 years age to a London of 200 years hence. Bridget (Miss Renee Zellweger) is a lady of some 30 years still in a single state and very desirous of meeting a suitable young man and settling into matrimony. Unlike my heroine Elizabeth Bennet she is not living at home and has a paid occupation, but nevertheless her mother (Miss Gemma Jones), a foolish woman, is constantly thrusting prospective husbands before her. One, of them, the son of a considerable local family, happens to be named Darcy (Mr. Colin Firth). Following my story, Bridget becomes enamoured of her employer, a Mr Cleaver (Mr. Hugh Grant), an utterly charming man who is a villain so base that my own Mr Wickham pales into insignificance. As in my novels sense prevails, if not sensibility, and Bridget and Darcy are reunited, but not before a great many parties and dinners and even some fisticuffs.I was struck with the ingenuity of replacing Elizabeth's sisters with Bridget's group of friends, which included a man described as a `pouf'  - I take him to be a kind of hairdresser. Much of their communication seem to take place at considerable distances by means of a device which grew out of their ears. I was amazed that little in the way of meaningful social intercourse between men and women took place until they had had sexual intercourse first. I recognised much of the London in which the drama takes place. It looked a great deal cleaner but I was puzzled by the absence of horses though I did notice Bridget driving in the snow at furious speed some manner of self-propelled metal cart, and Mr. Grant had another version with no roof. One should always allow other writers their artistic licence, even when they use one's own characters, as is the case here. However I must take the writers to task over their Bridget. Like my Elizabeth she is not devastatingly pretty, but she lacks Elizabeth's positive qualities of intelligence and good manners. Bridget spends most of her life in a state of embarrassed self-absorption as she bumbles (is that the word?) from one social fiasco to another. My Elizabeth was never such a clown, and if she were, Darcy would not have been interested in her.I must however congratulate the performers for their spirited rendering of their parts. Miss Zellweger (who I was amazed to discover is a native of our late American colonies) conveyed the agony of her entertaining but not very appealing character with great flair. Mr. Firth I have seen and admired before in the role of Darcy and he did not disappoint. Mr Jim Broadbent and Miss Gemma Jones were quite affecting as Bridget's parents, though it must be said that, foolish woman though she was, Mrs Bennet would never have run off with anyone, let alone an itinerant jewelry vendor with purple skin.",Null,0,0,28 July 2001
Notting Hill," Superb souffle
","Well, there seems to be a consensus it's a Romantic Comedy. Look folks, it's designed as a souffle. It's made from simple ingredients, it requires care and precision in manufacture and if properly made gives pleasure and goes down easily. This one is and does. The script sparkles, the actors act like they are enjoying it, and I laughed out loud a good deal. I didn't look at my watch, which is pretty well the ultimate test for any movie, and this one is two hours long. I even came out of the theatre feeling vaguely good about life. Cheaper than a bottle of wine and no hangover. Yes, I know Julia Roberts has a mouth like a postbox but she has a winsome look and beautiful dark brown eyes filled with melancholy and longing. (Probably for another 15 million dollar role.) Hugh Grant makes you believe he deserves some emotional happiness though his chances of achieving it with a Hollywood megastar are pretty remote. Spike probably gave the other Spike (Milligan - or maybe the Welsh nation) grounds for a defamation action but at worst was a minor irritant. As for the failure friends, so what? They're nice people and they help out. I enjoyed Alex Baldwin's cameo as the boorish boyfriend. He got us to hate him in about 30 seconds. Now that's acting.",Null,0,0,13 June 1999
The Aviator," Romantic capitalism produces fine entertainment
","Marty Scorsese is a Hollywood director with a sense of history who knows how to make very watchable middlebrow commercial pictures. Here he tells the story of one of American capitalism's more romantic heroes in an entertaining and spectacular fashion while not overlooking the demons which drove him. Although this is a big budget production with some stunning aerial scenes it is essentially a character study of a true American eccentric.I'm not sure many mothers would like their sons to grow up like Howard Hughes but his Mom as depicted here certainly left him with a deep fear of germs. It is a curious feature of the story that despite being obsessed by germs Howard was happy to risk infection by sleeping with countless women and to risk his life flying experimental planes with great daring and gusto. Having lost both parents by the time he was 20, Hughes inherited a prosperous medium sized business which manufactured drilling bits for the oil industry and proceeded to build a huge ramshackle empire, including a film studio, an aircraft manufacturer and TWA, once America's largest domestic and second-largest international airline. He started out by nearly going broke making the World War I aviation epic 'Hell's Angels', got interested in aircraft design, and constructed some pretty way-out craft, including the Hercules flying boat or 'Spruce Goose' (framed from timber, aluminium being unavailable), then the largest plane ever to fly. It seems, incidentally that all this was funded by the US taxpayer and the lil' old Hughes Tool Company of Houston, Texas, which was the only part of Hughes's empire to consistently make money.And then there were the women. Wow. If ever there was a man who lived out his teenage fantasies it was Howard. He is shown here as an adroit seducer who meets his match in Katharine Hepburn, though they break up after she meets the love of her life, Spencer Tracy. One of the best scenes in the film is a lunch at the Hepburn family estate where Howard is confronted with the whole nutty Hepburn family, all of whom seem to have mastered the art of making outsiders uncomfortable. Then there is the beautiful Ava Gardner, who never seems to let Howard get too close, Jane Russell, the lady whose bra Howard famously designed for 'The Outlaw' (who, still living, is mentioned only), and many others, some dangerously young, though it has to be said that Howard seems to have retained a mental age of 15 or so for most of his life.There are many fine performances in the film. Leonardo Di Caprico is a plausible, if very edgy Howard, and actually starts to look like him in the later Senate inquiry scenes (for a moment I thought they had slotted Sam Neil into the part). Cate Blanchett, burlier than the real Kate, powers her way through the part of Katherine Hepburn, tomboy. I really enjoyed Alan Alda, almost unrecognisable from his 'Mash' days, as one of the villains, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, President of Pan American Airlines, and the other major villain, puts in an avuncular performance which relies a lot on his infectious grin, but it does not seem out of place. On the other hand Kate Beckinsale is a bit too perfectly dressed and too much in control as Ava Gardner  perhaps Marty is suggesting her as a mother figure in contrast to Cate's tomboy sister. Ian Holm was wasted in his minor role as the Prof and Jude Law was superfluous as Errol Flynn.It's a good story, though at 170 minutes the film is a bit on the long side, and I'm not going to take Scorsese to task for his historical inaccuracies. I wonder however whether the early signs of madness were so evident. Noah Dietrich, the very able executive portrayed by John C Reilly in the film was first employed by Hughes in 1925 and remained no. 2 in Hughes's empire until the late 1950s. In his 1977 memoirs, as I recall, Dietrich says Hughes really only started to fall apart in that decade, particularly after the failure of his marriage to Jean Peters, which falls outside the time frame of this picture. Scorsese for dramatic purposes has to give us a foretaste of what is to come, but it does have the effect of making Hughes seem nuttier than he actually was at the time. Still, this is all-round good entertainment which I'm sure is all Marty intended.Finally, a special mention for the set designers who, it seems, managed to turn the lobby of the Southwestern University Law School into a fair representation of the fashionable 30s' nightspot, the 'Coconut Grove'.",7,4,6,17 February 2005
American Pie," Nicely heated, pretty bland
","Yet another teenage rite of passage flick churned out by the Hollywood sausage factory. However this one is low fat, not particularly salty and has quality ingredients. Four senior high school buddies vow to lose their virginity by the end of the high school year and before they go to college. (Naturally, everybody's going to college even if it's on a Lacrosse scholarship). You'd think that wouldn't be hard. Well of course it's not, but the trick here is to keep the audience guessing as to how. The girls (no gays please, this is Middle America) are eager but inexperienced (with the exception of a ridiculously tanned and beautiful exchange student from evil old Eastern Europe who seems to have been at it for years). So are the boys. There's too much talk and not enough action, lots of false starts and misunderstandings.Naturally, in an update of this hoary old storyline, the Internet get used to broadcast round the campus the hero's fumblings with Ms Czech Republic (shades of Hot Lips Hoolahan and the company dentist in 'Mash'). Naturally, the climax (and I use that word advisedly) comes at the after-prom party, and it is a multiple one. Naturally, the parents scarcely seem to be aware of what's happening (except for one who becomes part of the action - 'Mrs Robinson' is a potent American myth). Naturally, the guys are types, your ordinary average sex maniac who'll try it with a warm apple pie, the gentle jock, the pimply guy with sophisticated tastes, the other ordinary average sex maniac who actually has a girlfriend but isn't getting very far.OASM no.1 (he with the apple pie and awful parent) is nicely played with eager desperation by Jason Biggs, who looks a lot like Adam Sandler but is a lot less irritating. Chris Klein as the jock puts in a sensitive performance, as does Mena Suvari (a stand-out in American Beauty as the beauty) as his Kylie Minogue-like girlfriend. The rest of the cast are all pretty ordinary, but it's a nice looking production appropriately filmed in the springtime.The US education system succeeds brilliantly at one thing, prolonging the dependency and emotional immaturity of adolescence of kids who go to college. They won't have jobs and be free of parents and school, not to say school friends until they are at least 25, probably 30. It is of course all a conspiracy so Hollywood can sell movies like this. That half of the population who don't go to college and instead wind up in McJobs at $5 an hour (if they are lucky) will of course hit reality much earlier. I'm not sure they will find much to relate to here, or all that much to envy, at least on the emotional front. If you can't be bothered watching this movie just view the trailer - it has most of the funniest bits in it.",Null,0,0,27 February 2000
Burn After Reading," Coen bros provide an antidote to spydom
","Yes, this movie is a lesser Coen Bros movie, the story hardly makes sense, the characters are mostly idiots and the human race is in general treated with contempt, but that didn't stop me enjoying it. The Coens simply don't employ bad actors, though Brad Pitt went beyond his range a bit as one of two airhead gym employees (the other is played by Frances McDormand) who try to blackmail a former CIA operative. That operative is played, all stops out, by John Malkovich, and his icy wife by Tilda Swinton. Her lover is played by George Clooney, being a real sleaze for once. There is also a wonderful cameo by JK Simmons as a CIA bigwig which probably does that organisation more damage than the Bay of Pigs invasion. As this character says, the story doesn't make sense, but if you stick around (the film is only 90 minutes long) you will be treated to some pretty subversive comedy and a feast of good acting. I happen to see this film the day after 'A quantum of solace: the Coen Brothers are a good antidote to the idiocies of the spy genre.",7,2,7,11 November 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Definitely a ray of sunshine
","This wry, subversive and amusing take on the American family and child beauty contests is 100 minutes of sheer enjoyment. It's also proof of the saying that good art does not come from nowhere. The directors, husband and wife team Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, have never made a feature movie before, yet have had 20 years experience making commercials and MTV programs. There is no really big-name star but the actors are mostly very experienced (and well chosen) - even 9 year old Abigail Breslin as Olive is an experienced child actor. The production history was convoluted and the picture came very close to not being made on several occasions. The result is an almost perfectly realized comedy with hardly a surplus line which leaves a warm afterglow in audiences.There were dysfunctional fictional American families before the Hoovers and the Hoovers themselves are not particularly freaky. It's actually seven-year old Olive who wants to be a beauty queen. Mum (Tony Collette) is pre-occupied with the welfare of her brother Frank (Steve Carell) a Proust scholar who recently attempted suicide after losing his lover and his job. Dad (Greg Kinnear), a struggling motivational counseller, doesn't spot Olive on his emotional radar until he sees her as a way of proving the effectiveness of his nine-points to success program. Crude old Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is supportive, and does some coaching, in between snorting heroin. Teenage brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), aspiring USAF pilot immersed in a Nietzschean silence, is an unwilling passenger on the VW Microbus to the grand contest at Redondo Beach, California. So we have a family comedy, a road movie, and a sharp dig at the American obsessions with youth and success, not to mention the authoritarian bureaucracies that infest the land of the free.Despite the fun in getting there, via the interstates, gas stations and highway patrols, the climax of the movie is undoubtedly the pre-teen beauty pageant. Here the directors managed to persuade real contestants in real such contests to do their stuff, and some of it is frighteningly professional  at least one gymnastic act by an 8 year old would qualify for the Olympics. Olive's act is not in the same class, but she brings the house down nonetheless, to the great discomfort of officialdom. Needless to say she doesn't win, but the family walks (or rather runs) away together, more united than before.Pre-teen beauty contests are an ugly business and the murder case of Jo-Benet Ramsay was a reminder of the unwholesomeness of it all, but the film-makers here play it straight  what you see is what the fans get - and you can form your own view about what these contests tell you about American popular culture and mores. But you needn't worry about the message  there are enough pure laughs here to justify the price of admission.",9,3,6,2 December 2006
American Beauty," Escaping the Human Condition
","This is  a mordant tale of suburban angst in an age where success is mostly about money and moral compromise. Probably not everybody has a spouse having it off with the King (her real estate competitor), conceives a passion for one of his daughter's school friends (a ditzy cheerleader who does however look great covered in rose petals), has a paranoid military type move in next door, finds his daughter, who despises her parents has become involved with Colonel Crazy's weird son, and loses his job, like Lester Burnham. 
No wonder Lester tells us by voice over at the beginning `in less than a year's time I'll be dead'. A terminal mid-life crisis, in fact. Yet there is an element of universality about all this. The only work the economic machine offers a talented writer is doing P.R. brochures. Comfort and security are provided to those who conform, in thought and action, to the ruthless commercial ethic, like the rutting real estate brokers. Clever mavericks, like the mad marine's son, are able to play the system they reject. Honest rebels are shot.Kevin Spacey is fine as Lester, and I thought Annette Bening, though a bit full-on, gave us a good portrait as the adulterous wife, stimulated by sales performance rather than intimacy. The kids were all great too, especially Wes Bentley as Ricky, the weird boy next door, who turned what could have been a blue-eyed monster into a sympathetic character. As a mainstream picture from a big studio plenty of money has been spent on the production, itself something of a commentary. The direction has a light touch and we are not battered with the obvious.At the end I wondered if the punches had had been pulled somewhat, especially where Lester's passion for the cheerleader is concerned. Wasn't he just a bit too nice? For that matter wasn't his wife just a bit too nasty? Well, it's a comedy, I laughed a good deal, and thanked my lucky stars I don't work in P.R. or have a wife in real estate.",Null,0,0,22 February 2000
Judgment at Nuremberg," A definitive, if ponderous, courtroom drama
","This dour and lengthy (3 hours) courtroom drama deals with the tail end of the Nuremberg trials of 1946-48, when many of the Nazi leaders were tried for their part in the totalitarian nightmare which engulfed Germany between 1933 and 1945. By 1948 the chief villains had been dealt with and the Tribunal had moved on to the supporting players, in this case four of the judges who had worked for the Nazi state. The particular trial, based on an earlier TV film also written by Abby Mann, is fictional, but founded on fact. A very high quality cast keeps the viewer engaged. How was it that many high officials, let alone ordinary Germans, did not admit to knowing the true horror of the 'final solution'? How was it possible that eminent lawyers would co-operate with the Nazi regime despite their distaste for it? How could their conduct be defended, let alone be excused?As Hans Rolfe, the youthful defence counsel for the most prominent judge, Ernst Janning (a noble-looking but rather wooden Burt Lancaster), Maximilian Schell gives the Tribunal of three American judges plenty of histrionics. It is evident that Germany, and not just the judges is on trial. But the scriptwriter does not allow the defendants off the hook. One, played by Werner Klemperer, is unrepentant, another is befuddled. Only Ernst Janning puts up any kind of defence, to the effect that he thought he could ameliorate things by playing along with the Nazis. This did not stop him from ordering sterilization of mental defectives and the execution of an old Jewish man for allegedly having sex with a 16 year old non-Jewish girl. The problem, of course is a very large number of Germans approved of repressive policies towards Jews. The Nazis were overtly anti-semitic from the start and it needs to be remembered that in the election in January 1933 which brought Hitler to power the Nazi party got the largest proportion of votes cast, 43%. Hitler brooked no opposition, and anyone who got in the way was disposed of summarily. Only the aristocratic army officer corps offered any real resistance, and then only late in the piece because they saw Hitler as ruining Germany. For someone like Janning exile was not an option Â– it was either play along or go to a concentration camp for opposing the regime. He admits his mistake, but of course it's cold comfort to the victims.Spencer Tracey could make just about any character likable, and our sympathies are soon captured by the affable and apparently fair-minded Judge Hayward. But he proves incapable of getting to the bottom of the matter. Justice of a sort is done, and the defendants have their day (actually several months) in court, but the whole proceeding has some of the elements of a show trial. Ironically, both the prosecutor (a relentless Richard Widmark) and the Tribunal members are for political reasons pressured by people in the military who should have known better to go easy on the defendants. Currently we have kangaroo court style US military tribunals set up by the late unlamented Bush regime to deal with people picked up in the invasion of Iraq and elsewhere. Fortunately it looks like the regular courts will wind up disposing of these cases. However, the Nuremburg Tribunal, victor's justice it may have been, can be defended on the grounds there was nothing else. In retrospect it was an imperfect exercise. This film remains a worthy attempt to give an account of it.",8,2,4,20 March 2009
Apocalypse Now," More to watch, but not more to experience
","This is a review of the DVD version of 'Apocalypse Now Redux', but there's not much added to the DVD of any consequence . The movie has a peculiar balance with the mayhem of the first half set against the almost spiritual journey of the second, but Willard is even at the start having some psychological difficulty with fighting the war so there is unity overall. (Even the stress of making the movie gave Martin Sheen a heart attack.) Coppola certainly succeeded in making an anti-war movie; there is little difference in the tactics of surfin' Bill Kilgore than those of Colonel Kurtz further up the river. Kilgore, however, has not (yet) been disowned by his side. As to the 40 or so minutes added, the French plantation episode is interesting but out of sympathy with the rest of the film; you can see why it was cut originally. The rest doesn't add much; the Playboy bunnies in the mud just pile on the agony. As for the Marlon bits, Brando as Kurtz certainly fits the image of the old bull waiting to be put out of his misery, and we see a bit more of him in this version, but he doesn't fit the script very well (Kurtz is meant to be a very active 40) and ultimately there is no really credible explanation of how he became master of his personal hell-hole ('the horror, the horror'). Conrad in the book this film is derived from, 'Heart of Darkness' didn't do much better, so I suppose we shouldn't be too critical.Perhaps this movie is best seen rather than analysed. Visually it is terrific, even if, as Coppola explains, the pyrotechnics at the end occurred in an effort to clear the site. We are by Willard's side the whole time (he is in almost every scene) and at the end feel we understand. This and 'Full Metal Jacket' will probably be the two American movies most associated with the Vietnam War and neither can be said to be in praise of war. It's interesting to compare 'Apocalyse' with 'Thin Red Line.' In the latter, the enemy, the Japanese on Guadacanal are purely military, but the fear, chaos and ultimate pointlessness are similar. 'Apocalypse' was lucky in its timing Â– by 1979 Americans were ready to re-examine their role in Vietnam. No studio would have released it in 1969, the year it is set. Twenty years later, it stands up as a piece of bravura film-making and is almost hypnotic to watch. I hope Coppola is still around to do 'Destination Bagdad' when the American public are ready to face up to the consequences of the next bit of military lunacy their politicians and generals are planning.",Null,0,0,29 December 2002
The Patriot," Mad Max meets Braveheart - history a casualty
","I did not view this movie under ideal conditions (I saw it in a technically inadequate theatre in downtown Lima, Peru) and perhaps it can be enjoyed for the spectacle, but it is essentially a rather personal story that does not work. Martin, played by Mel Gibson, with various demons in his past, goes to the Revolutionary War (1776 and all that) to avenge the death of his son. We get American heros (apart from the odd loyalist traitor), English villains except perhaps for General Cornwallis (good work by Tom Wilkinson) who does come across as something of a gentleman. Martin wages a guerrilla campaign against the British as unprincipled as the  (now defunct) Shining Path in Peru. The British, under Martin's nemesis Colonel Tavington (a smooth and nasty Jason Issacs) hit back hard, the population suffering greatly as a result.The tide is turned, not by Martin and his band, but by the intervention of the French and the battle of Yorktown. So Martin has killed a lot of people, and for what? What's the point of patriotism if it's motivated by personal revenge? (At the outset, Martin is all for negotiating with dear (not so old) mad King George). If it had been the filmmakers' intention to make that point there would be no point in complaining, but instead Martin is presented as a man doing what a man's gotta do. I also took great exception to the church burning scene when as far as we know nothing like that ever happened in the Revolutionary War, though the Nazis did a fair bit of that sort of thing in World War 2.Heath Ledger does nicely as Martin's son Gabriel, and I'm sure we'll see him again. After this one though I'm not sure I want to see Mel Gibson again in a movie. His is a thoroughly wooden performance, though not helped by a script full of cliches and anachronisms (eg the reference to black emancipation). Even 6 soles (US$2) was too much to pay for this film. No, read a good book about the Revolutionary War instead.",Null,1,2,31 August 2000
Being John Malkovich," Being there is better than being here
","What makes us ordinary people interested in celebrities? One factor is that celebrities seem to have more interesting lives than the rest of us; hence we can't help wondering what it would be like to be one. This movie asks how would it feel to be a moderately famous (and very good) actor for a while. Not surprisingly, while others might be content to go along for the ride, the protagonist here, Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), being a puppet-master by profession, wants to take over. The film is set in New York, the town where success, and failing success, celebrity, is of supreme importance. Craig, unable to make a living as a puppeteer, gets a mundane filing job in an old and rather odd office. In the office Craig stumbles on a way (a 'portal') to put people into the actor John Malkovich's head for 15 minutes at a time. With his co-worker Maxine he finds there is no shortage of customers at $200 a visit. But the effect on Craig's and his wife Lottie's relationship is both unexpected and dramatic.
As for John (Horatio) Malkovich, he graciously goes along for the ride as well, allowing himself to be sent up in various amusing ways. Having discovered what Craig and Maxine are up to, he forces his way through the queue and puts himself into his own mind. Guess how the world appears? In a word, Malkovichian. He even allows a few  (possibly notional) subconscious skeletons (eg. ridicule suffered as a sensitive child) to be exposed.It turns out Craig is not the only person who knows about the portal, and hey, if you're old and ugly, what better way to renew yourself than to take over a celebrity? One could sum this up as 'the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' meets 'Coccon.' Really, the film is a very funny look at the notion of fame and the question of identity. Can you be yourself even though you are in someone else's body? The suggestion is that you can, but you might do a lot better with the right one. There's a wonderful send-up of the unctious show-biz documentary, after Malkovich, with Craig in charge, switches to puppeteering to great critical acclaim, leaving several other celebrities including Brad Pitt and Sean Penn looking a bit forlorn.John Cusack plays Craig with wonderfully dishevelled conviction and is well supported by Cameron Diaz who is practically unrecognisable as the equally dishevelled animal loving Lotte. Catherine Keener as the mercenary Maxine has a rather unsympathetic character and some good lines. She radiates the required sex appeal though. I liked Orson Bean as the rather unbelievable 105-year-old principal of the filing company whose courtly manners are a thin veneer for his raging hormones. As for Mr. Malkovich, he plays himself as your average fastidious fairly precious actor, a persona that may or may not be near the truth but is pretty plausible. There is one gem of a scene where Malkovich/Craig tells his slick agent (Carlos Jacott) that he is switching to puppeteering. The agent doesn't bat an eyelid - acting for an insane John Malkovich is still better than representing a talented nobody. 'Sure,' says the agent, 'Just let me call a couple of people.'
The ending of the movie is a bit odd. I got the impression that most of the packed audience at the showing I went to did not realise what had happened. There is no obvious link between our last sight of Craig standing by a ramp onto the New Jersey Turnpike, the exit from the portal, and the final voice-over. Overall, though, funny, fresh, well executed and entertaining.",Null,1,3,1 January 2000
American History X," Sober telling of a sombre story
","Venice Beach, Los Angeles, is associated with gym freaks and other crazy people but Venice itself is mainly a settled, largely white lower middle class community - the sort of place a long-serving L A policeman or fireman might live. The film suggests that it is also the kind of place that might breed extreme right wing reaction to the inflow of other races. The protagonist here is Derick (Edward Norton) a bright young man whose life has been blighted but the murder of his father, a fireman, while fighting a blaze in a black ghetto. He turns to neo-nazism as peddled by the furtive Cameron (Stacy Keach). Sent to prison for killing two black intruders in his home, he comes out no longer a racist. But the past will not let him go, and the cycle of violence goes on.A gloomy story, but honestly told. A good proportion of the film is done as flashback, in black and white, adding to the austerity of the story. There are some interesting suggestions bound to upset the politically correct, for example that affirmative action is counter productive, that prison might actually have the desired effect on some people, that education is an inadequate response to racism amongst the young, and that some neo-nazis might be idealists, not just thugs, and hence be far more dangerous.",Null,0,0,11 December 1999
Quantum of Solace," Fast pace too much for tired Bond.
","The last two Bond films have had Bond at the end of his emotional tether. on the point of resignation (or even termination) from the Service. Daniel Craig is a fine actor, but his virile good looks mock the worn - out spy image, despite the efforts of the make-up department. He seems to make a remarkable recovery from each set of injuries he receives.This film is a sequel to 'Casino Royale' - indeed the story follows right on with a pre-credit sequence of a hairy chase along an Italian lakeside road. The Aston, car lovers will note, is only slightly damaged and Bond motors on to Siena, and arrives in the middle of a horse race. A thrilling rooftop chase, the best in the movie, ensues, then to Austria, Haiti, Italy again and finally to action sequences in Bolivia (actually filmed in Chile). There are two problems with the action. First, there is little escalation of tension. Everything happens so fast that it becomes a blur. Second, this is compounded in places by running two different action sequences at once and intercutting them, which adds to the confusion.The storyline is the usual conspiracy of world domination, this time through locking up water supplies, but the chief villain played by the fine French actor from the diving bell Matthias is not very prepossessing. Olga the new Bond girl, pretty as she is, doesn't make much of an impact either. Judy Dench as M however has a better part than in 'Casino' and makes the most of it.Visually, the new Bond movies are still great to watch, at least if you like demolition Derbys. But dramatically the content has become very thin. There is hardly an original line in the script, let alone an original idea. Others have noted the similarity with the Bourne movies (which had some of the same production team). The first Bond film, 'Dr No' appeared 45 years ago, and I still remember chunks of it. This film is not likely to last so well.",6,3,6,11 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," The Coen universe is a scary place
","This latest bloody drama from the Coen Brothers has had a mixed reception and my reaction was mixed also. As they have stuck fairly closely to the original book by Cormac McCarthy, the improbabilities and loose ends are not theirs alone. But the way the story is told, with the outcome of some key scenes left up in the air, and the sudden disposal of key characters, is, frankly, playing with the audience. This is not a movie that stands up well to post-screening analysis. On the other hand, assisted by the harshly beautiful US South West, the cinemaphotography is gorgeous. There are three absolutely stand-out performances, plenty of tension, and a moral message. Though it is a drama rather than a comedy there's also the trademark Coen Bros wry humour, though there is a good deal less here than in, say, 'Fargo'.Early on, I thought I was watching a 'crime procedural' thriller where the director was focusing on how the hunter/assassin and the criminal/fugitive operated. Will Llewelyn (Josh Brolin), the poor deer shooter who has made off with the dead drug smugglers' $2 million manage to evade Anton (Javier Bardem) the hired assassin with the funny haircut? It becomes apparent that this is unlikely, and the focus shifts to Tommy Lee Jones' character, the aging Sheriff Bell, who is bringing up the rear. Towards the end, the ambiguities, loose ends and implausibilities mount up and the thrust of the story is lost.Although set in a specific time and place (SW Texas 1980) the story has a timelessness about it. But there is no real hero and the Coen universe seems to have a random quality about it. It's a scary place, and it seems we don't have much say in how things work out. Anton the assassin, the embodiment of evil, is the most determined character in the film. All the Sheriff can do is tag along behind, counting the bodies, though at one point he seems to be close to cracking the case. As for Llewelyn, well, he tries hard, but you can't beat Fate, whether or not it comes with a bad haircut. Not a film for those who like tidy endings.",7,1,3,30 December 2007
Saving Private Ryan," A visual experience 10 years later
","I saw this when it was first released in 1998 and wrote a review which for some reason never got posted. 500 films later, and seeing Tarantino's very idiosyncratic war movie, 'Inglourious Barsterds' I was reminded of this one, where the story is played absolutely straight in a way to give the average American patriot goosebumps. Yet the rescuing of Sergeant Ryan (Matt Damon) is actually a cynical effort by the High Command to boost morale which puts eight brave men into jeopardy. Spielberg's battle scenes are really something – ten years later I still vividly recall the first 20 minutes on the Normandy beach – the audience is put right in it. Other than that I remember a vivid fire fight in a ruined French village and the final scene 40 years later. I had to be reminded that it was Tom Hanks who led the rescue team (I do recall Vin Diesel in it too), so the acting didn't leave much impression. The actors were overpowered by all the action.Perhaps comparing this blockbuster with Tarantino is not fair, Both films entertain in there own way – Spielberg, who gives us splendid visuals, is utterly conventional and offends very few viewers and Tarantino does things his own way and doesn't care who he offends (though he does not make light of atrocity). Has the second world war movie run its course? Even if the answer is 'yes' we have not seen the end of war movies in general. As long as there are wars there will be movies about them. 'Ryan' at least tells a coherent story, and survival stories are usually both pretty gripping and mildly uplifting. Tarantino, on the other hand is inclined toward nihilism, but he does have fun getting there. Spielberg is more hard work, but 'Ryan' has to be one of his better films.",7,1,2,12 September 2009
Revolutionary Road," Sad suburban tale
","The 1950s in America look in retrospect peaceful and prosperous years, despite the Cold War, but many citizens found the security and comfort of suburban living claustrophobic, especially those who had fought in the Second World War and embraced danger. Richard Yates captured these anxieties in his 1961 novel with his 'perfect couple' Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet). Ironically it is April, once an aspiring actress, who wants a change from bringing up their two lovely children in their leafy suburb in Connecticut even though Frank is bored by his city job in machinery sales. She sells him her idea of working in Paris ('the one place overseas you said you really liked'). But it involves her working at the US embassy as a secretary (at fabulous money) while Frank has a sabbatical, supported by his wife. Frank's mates in the office don't think it's such a great idea and Frank starts to have doubts, as well as an affair with his secretary. Then April becomes pregnant again. Without giving away the story, it can be said that things do not work out for our protagonists. Americans like happy endings but Richard Yates (and Sam Mendes) are not about to give them one. The period is beautifully invoked; I was reminded of Todd Haynes's tribute film 'Far from Heaven' (2002) which refers to the 1950s melodramas of Douglas Sirk ('All that Heaven Allows'). The minor characters are also a delight, particularly Kathy Bates as the local real estate agent and Michael Shannon as her brain damaged but brutally frank son. But this is nevertheless a sad story. Being a child of those golden years of parents who didn't throw over the traces I don't remember much unhappiness, but I do remember that people who did not fit in rather stood out  respectability had a narrow range. The following two decades saw a revolution in personal relationships and a reassessment of the role of women our society. It's hard to say if Yates and Mendes are blaming society for their character's ills or blaming the characters for passing up the opportunity for more freedom. Perhaps both factors are at work, but there's no doubt people became less timid in the next decade. We feel sorry for Frank and April but at the same time annoyed they do not break out. Revolution might well have been the better option.",8,1,2,24 February 2009
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Visual Kung Fu feast
","The Taiwanese born Ang Yee is nothing if not versatile, having in the last few years directed a very polished version of the English classic comedy of manners `Sense and Sensibility' and the very evocative American family tragedy `Ice Storm'. This film brings us to the director's cultural roots, being set in 19th century China and telling the tale of two sets of lovers with strong martial arts backgrounds.The cinematography is stunning and the stunts breathtaking; at times you think you are watching ballet rather than swordfighting. There were some magnificent desert shots and some amazing scenes in the tops of a bamboo forest (I trust no Giant Panda habitat was destroyed in the making). The characters are well defined but rather two-dimensional and don't develop much, perhaps they are more archetypes than characters. The younger lady, `supergirl' is rather improbable thought the older pair of lovers ring true - a lady with a past is inherently more interesting than a virginal whirlwind from nowhere.This movie apparently comes out of a long tradition of Kung Fu films, a genre that bores me rigid, but somehow the director kept me interested until the end. I think it was the sheer ingenuity of the thing that kept me watching. What it says about the culture it come from I'm not sure Â– aggressive, romantic, fatalistic, superstitious, highly developed sense of beauty, all come to mind. Certainly, a strong sense of tradition. Anyway, a visual treat.",Null,0,0,24 March 2001
The Lives of Others," Stasi a lesson to us all
","It has been suggested that the story of Hauptmann Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a senior, dedicated and zealous Stasi East German (DDR) secret police officer who starts to empathise with the subjects of his investigation is rather improbable, but to me it rings true emotionally.His subjects are Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright currently in party favour, and his actress lover Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck). Sooner or later, an inhabitant of the chill world of secret policing with no private life to speak of sent to investigate 'artists' is going to feel the warmth and charm of the milieu he is spying on, especially where, as here, he soon realises that his superiors' motives for the investigation are corrupt.Apologists for the Stasi (and given it employed 100,000 and had at least 200,000 informers these are numerous) say the DDR was a system that ran according to laws which were designed to protect society, but as is inevitable in totalitarian regimes the laws were perverted by those in charge to serve their own ends. Thus loathsome culture minister Hempf wants to get something on Dreyman so he can have the lovely Christa Maria all to himself, and Wiesler's slimy boss Grubitz is only too happy to oblige.Wiesler's conversion from dedicated servant of the regime to furtive dissident is an amazing process to watch, and Ulrich Muhe, who happens to be an 'ossi' (former DDR resident), makes it very plausible. Despite tragedy, the movie has a surprisingly upbeat ending. The complacent Hempf believes people don't change but this does not mean they are entirely predictable.We see a fair amount of the Stasi at work. The rank and file are not portrayed as monsters, or automatons, just ordinary workers prepared to crack jokes about their masters at work. Most of what they do is minor harassment directed towards encouraging conformity. It is not hard to break the rules in a society where you need permission to subscribe to a foreign newspaper. It is an interesting irony that one of the catalysts of Wiesler's silent rebellion is the work of Bertold Brecht, at one time an enthusiastic supporter of the DDR.Whatever you think of its politics, this is a very fine film, with not a single one of its 137 minutes wasted. It is certainly an antidote to the 'ossie' nostalgia said to possess some residents of the former DDR and wonderfully satirised in 'Good-Bye Lenin'. But it also asks all of us how would we behave in similar circumstances. If it might be to your individual advantage (and to the disadvantage of your enemy) would you do it? The Stasi had even otherwise loving couples informing on each other. We can only hope that, despite our own overzealous secret policemen who are doing their best to undermine our civil liberties in the name of anti-terrorism, we never get to such depths in this country. I do hope Phil Ruddock (our Attorney-General) gets to see this movie.",9,9,14,31 March 2007
Good Will Hunting," genuine geniuses don't mop floors
","By definition, most of us are fairly ordinary, but we seem to expect that people with marked ability should make the most of it. To use the biblical phrase, hiding one's talent under a bushell ( a brand of tea here in Australia) is a sin. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, better known as actors, put together the screenplay here which has to be regarded as a promising first attempt (they did get an Academy Award for it), but which is still rather uneven. There is some good dialogue and some very trite stuff,  the characters do not surprise or even develop much and the story is reliant on coincidence.Will Hunting (Matt Damon), from working class South Boston, is a 20 year old janitor at MIT, who happens to have mathematical ability exceeding that of the professors, not to mention a photographic memory and a firm grasp of Western history and philosophy. Something of a coincidence? Strangely, he remains undiscovered until he is spotted by a professor solving on a blackboard a difficult problem set for students. Will has an attitude and a liking for thumping people (acquired it seems in his disturbed childhood) and is about to go to jail, but the prof intervenes and Will is let out on a bond provided he learns some maths and sees a counsellor. After a couple of false starts (to emphasise just what a difficult little b'stard Will is), Robin Williams hoves into view as the counsellor, Maguire. The rest of the story concerns Dr Maguire's attempts to help Will sort out his problems, which become more complicated when he become involved with English medical student Minnie Driver (called Skylab or something).Both Matt Damon (nearly B A Harvard) and Ben Affleck (his childhood friend in Cambridge, Mass.) have middle class backgrounds and it was no doubt a bit of a challenge for them to write a script  about someone like Will. It would have been very interesting if someone really from a poor Boston background like Mark Wahlberg had done it. Will is sensitively realised and we see that it is difficult for someone with his fractured upbringing to have much self-worth. Yet no-one with a brain like his lacks an ego and I couldn't help thinking he wouldn't need Robin Williams to discover it for him.
I thought the most intriguing character in the film was Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), the MIT maths professor who discovers Will. Even though Lambeau has won the maths equivalent of the Nobel Prize, Will can still out-prove him, if that's the word. He is jealous, but he also is determined that Will succeed. He needs to believe Will is like him in that he must be pushed to succeed. Then Lambeau can tell himself if he had been pushed even harder he might have reached Will's level. At least then he will get some of the credit.I had Gus Van Sant down as a rather odd-ball director with a gay sensibility (`My  Own Private Idaho', `Even Cowgirls Get the Blues') though he got a bit more mainsteam in `The Rainmaker' (also with Matt Damon). This is a very nice ordinary quiet mainstream picture with a few good moments. Van Sant has since revisited the topic of nurturing genius (literary this time) in `Forrester'. This earlier effort is more effective because the Will character is a kind of Mozart of math, with God-given ability, and it's hard not to root for him, whereas the protagonist in `Forrester' is a cultural product, albeit black and from the slums. With his beefy glower, Matt Damon looks right and  projects Will's hostility well while Robin Williams turns down the volume and puts in a restrained, almost elegant performance. You could rent worse for a quiet, cerebral, Friday night.",Null,1,4,6 August 2001
Gran Torino," Vintage Clintwood
","Here, Clint Eastwood directs himself in the role of Walt Kowalski, a 78 year old retired auto worker, who has just lost his wife. Emotionally distanced from his two sons who want him in a retirement home and even more so from his grandchildren, he drinks cheap beer and scowls from his porch as his declining Highland Park, Detroit, neighbourhood is taken over by migrants from Asia. After a bungled attempt by the Hmong kid next door, Thao, to steal Clint's precious 1973 Gran Torino Sports as part of a gang initiation, Walt gets to know the family, including Thao's bright young sister Sue. He is surprised to discover that the Hmong are an ethnic minority from Vietnam who supported the US during the war. He supervises Thao's unofficial community service, teaches him (with Harry the barber, a delightful minor character) to talk like an American working-class male, buys him tools and helps gets him a job. But this upsets the gang, and Walt finds himself in a nasty confrontation.I am an admirer of Clint Eastwood's more recent work (the earlier action stuff is less alluring though Dirty Harry is a classic of its kind) and have enjoyed 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil', 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby'. Midnight was pretty shallow, but he entertains and stimulates the mind at the same time. I don't quite know how Eastwood the director manages to direct Clint the actor; perhaps there is another persona, Clintwood, who does it for him.Walt, who shares his surname with a much younger curmudgeon, Stanley Kowalski (Brando's role in 'Streetcar Named Desire'), sees his world fading away. Worse, he realizes his life has been wasted, raising hateful unpatriotic children and working in a plant producing, as Dan Neil of the LA Times put it 'overfed, undersprung and largely unlamented muscle cars' such as his prized Gran Torino. He also has bad memories from his service in the Korean War. Walt is a grumpy old bigot but Eastwood, with that grim, granite face of his makes us understand. I couldn't help thinking though he would not have been the most congenial of husbands.Early on in the story, the ridiculously young parish priest, after promising Walt's wife to do so on her deathbed, tries to get Walt to attend confession. He does, eventually, but it's interesting that Walt has not a lot to be guilty about. And, in the end, he redeems himself. It would be a very curmudgeonly person indeed who did not cheer, inwardly at least, at the final frames. The Gran Torino is up and running along Lakeshore Drive in the hands of a representative of the new America. Clint, I think, is cheering him along.",8,1,5,28 February 2009
Moulin Rouge!," A whirl of colour and sound in the name of love
","The first 20 minutes, a kaleidoscopic whirl of colour, sound and zooming cameras, was right over the top, and probably should be avoided by anyone prone to epileptic fits, but once things settle down this is actually a charming pastiche of circus and stagecraft with a delightful soundtrack featuring a pot-pourri of love songs from most of last century. The plot is gossamer-thin, but the two principal romantic performances from Ewen Robertson as Christian  and Nicole Kidman as the doomed Satine are powerful and convincing. They are supported by a galaxy of Australian talent, both in front and behind the camera, and there a few good imported performances such as  Jim Broadbent as the impresario Zidler, John Leguisamo as Toulouse-Lautrec and Jacek Koman as the Narcoleptic Argentinian.The musical numbers are a bit chopped about Â– the MTV cutting style makes a bit difficult to jump in and enjoy at times, but there are some inspired take-offs. Jim Broadfoot doing Maddona's `Like a Virgin' as he tries to persuade M le Duke (Richard Roxburgh) that's what Satine the courtesan will be like when she gets to his boudoir is hilarious. There is a very athletic production of `Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend' and a nice variation of `The Sound of Music.' The cast do the singing, and sing well.The style of production (and this is a very stylish production) reminded me a bit of the second `Babe' film and the 50s hit `Carousel.'  The film as a whole is a `reality dream,' fresh and original, and dare I say it, identifiably Australian in tone and humour. It is doing good business in the US and may even recover its US $52 million budget. Baz Luhrmann must be doing something right. His motto is clearly `nothing succeeds like excess' but somehow he has got away with it here. `Strictly Ballroom,' which seemed pretty flamboyant at the time is by comparison a very staid production. I await his next film with considerable trepidation.",Null,0,1,17 June 2001
The Illusionist," Magic entertainment
","This movie will inevitably be compared with Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige', another story about turn of the century stage magicians which also appeared in 2006. It is however a different kind of movie, quieter, and intense rather than spectacular. The setting is Vienna in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is a successful stage magician who unfortunately incurs the ire of the arrogant and autocratic Crown Prince Leopold (Rupert Sewell). We see the story through the eyes of Inspector Uhl, (Paul Giamatti) who is sent by Leopold to investigate Eisenheim. In fact, both Leopold and Eisenheim are in love with the same woman, Sophie, Duchess of Somewhere (Jessica Biel). So we get a tussle between power and intellect. No prizes for guessing the winner, but there's plenty of surprises on the way.We are treated to four very fine performances. Edward Norton as Eisenheim gives very little away and yet we sense his feelings. Paul Giamatti is more assertive than in some of his earlier roles  a bit like Claude Raines as the shady policeman in 'Casablanca'. He too, acts with his eyes. Rufus Sewell, who has very large eyes, does villains just as well as heroes, and does a very hiss-able one here, though on occasion I was strangely reminded of Jack Lemmon as the comically stark raving mad Prince Hapnik in 'The Great Race'. I haven't seen Jessica Biel before (a soap princess, it seems), but she has just the right fragile beauty for Sophie.The re-creation of the period is faultless, with Prague and environs filling in for Vienna. The film-makers were able to use Konopiste castle, the former Czech country home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which has an unforgettable hallway decorated with the heads of thousands of deer. Yes, you think, this is the home of someone who likes shooting things. The character of Leopold is based on that of Crown Prince Rudolf, heir to the throne, who is supposed to have committed suicide with his mistress at Mayerling in 1889, though it has been suggested he was murdered to forestall an attempt to overthrow his father. Franz Ferdinand was Rudolf's cousin (and subsequent heir to the throne) whose assassination in 1914 tipped Europe into the First World War.But the film is not historical, neither is it a mystery. You can believe in spirits if you like, or you can accept the rational explanation of the illusionist's 'magic'. This is a surprisingly entertaining film. What I find very interesting is that the director, Neil Burger, who also wrote the script, has apparently little prior experience in film-making, yet somehow managed to produce a tight, well-made entertainment. In the audio commentary on the DVD I watched he makes it clear his movie-making instincts are right on the button. The film is a credit to the Czech film crew as well. The producers, though, had the last laugh. This film cost $16.5 million to make and grossed over $32 m in the US alone. 'The Prestige' grossed $53m in the US but, made in the much more costly US, cost $40m. Good films both, but in their different ways.",8,1,2,10 December 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Not on the button science-wise
","Brad Pitt is good, Cate Blanchett excellent, and the production values lush. Despite half a dozen people playing the main character (a la Dylan) things fit together quite well. The atmosphere reminded me of Forrest Gump (with whom it shared a scriptwriter)  a cornball 'well, isn't that just life' sort of movie. Well, I don't mind southern corn (I lived and worked in New Orleans, where this film is mainly set, for a term a few years ago) and it tells a cute love story, but the central conceit, a person living backwards through time, is just plain ridiculous. 'Time like a mighty stream bears all its sons away'  in one direction. Anyone going in another direction would be another dimension  we could not see them and they could not see us. Of course literature need not obey the laws of physics but 'suspension of disbelief' is more difficult when physics is regarded as irrelevant. This is not so much science fiction as unscientific fiction.One curious aspect is the portrayal of African Americans in the story. It is as if the racism of the Deep South never existed, which I suppose fits in with the 'fairy tale' plot. Benjamin is brought up by the enormously sympathetic black proprietress of a genteel old people's home populated as far as I could see entirely by whites. Another odd thing is that one-one except Kate seems to notice that Ben is getting younger all the time. One might have thought his case would have aroused a certain amount of scientific interest. He also seems to be the only case, which is also odd.This is an entertaining enough movie, diverting at times though a bit long at two and a half hours. But I'd only give it an Oscar for the make-up.",Null,0,2,10 February 2009
Children of Men," A thinking person's thriller
","Alfonso Cuaron has given us a very clever rendering of a very English dystopian novel. P D James, the 'Baroness of Bad' is famous for her well-written and absorbing police procedural novels ('Inspector Dalgliesh') but in the early 90s she produced a vision of a world only 20 years into the future in which for unspecified reasons all the women on earth have become infertile and no babies have been born for the last 18 years.The rest of the world has lapsed into chaos but the British, stoically, have put the remainder of their civil liberties into the fire and have settled down under an oppressive dictatorship to ward off foreign boarders and await inevitable extinction, though there are some violent dissidents called the fish.Theo (Clive Owen), a journalist with connections to the top, is 'persuaded' by his ex-wife and fish member Julian (Julianne Moore) to obtain some exit papers for Kee (Claire Hope Ashity) a young black woman, who, it turns out, is pregnant. Theo is swept up in Kee's escape across a grim decaying landscape. Not only are there the security forces to contend with, but some equally ruthless insurgents. Cuaron builds the tension exquisitely, interspersing the adrenaline fueled bits with quieter bits.Kee' projected saviors are a mysterious group called the Human Project who conveniently sail their well-maintained Greenpeace style ex-North Sea fishing trawler past offshore light buoys in the hope of rescuing the human race. But the improbability of this doesn't matter much because by the end of the movie Cuaron has effectively demonstrated what the world would be like if humankind suddenly stopped reproducing. Having children is our way of cheating death, without them there is nothing but death, and in this future there are none about but the living dead.The casting is pretty well perfect. Clive Owen as Theo puts his haunted good looks to good use as he turns from cynical reporter to a hunted enemy of the state. The motley characters he meets along the way  his ex-wife, the fish rebels, the refugees who help him, the 'fascist pig' border guard and above all Michael Caine's aging hippie are all wonderfully realized.It has been suggested that Cuaron has really made a film about today, not 20 years into the future. The rampaging security forces we see might as well be in Bosnia or Iraq, or even Northern Ireland. In an age of terrorism, order without law very quickly becomes tyranny, which has never been the answer to terrorism. What he and PD James do demonstrate is just how fragile our civil society is.As a film this is a very fine piece of work. The sets exude grimy Britain, the battles are hair-raising, the quieter moments intense. Cuaron would do a great James Bond movie. He has turned a rather rarefied novel into an exiting and engrossing thriller without obscuring the original message. He is a very versatile and enterprising film-maker and I'm sure he's going to do lots more good stuff.",9,382,588,6 November 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Clint does a wagner number
","Clint Eastwood and Mary Shelley may not seem to have a lot in common, but both have a dab hand at Gothic Romance  dark stories of wish-fulfilment in which the central characters battle Fate, and lose, but do so heroically. Wagner wrote operas around such themes. Here, Clint has taken his text from the obscure 'F X Tool', a former boxing trainer and 'cut man', who published one well-received book of boxing short stories. 'Rope Burns' when he was nearly seventy. Here, aging, never quite has-been Frank against his better judgment takes on enthusiastic woman boxer Maggie, who though past 30 is aching to succeed, despite being a self-admitted piece of trailer trash. Maggie of course is literally a knockout and goes from strength to strength  until she comes up against the Bear, the meanest female fighter in the world. And then we flip over into almost a different story about the testing of faith.There is plenty of moody, gloomy photography and some fine boxing sequences (the Bear is played by a real women's boxing champion). Boxing is not my favourite sport but you do get to appreciate its attraction for those who are good at it. The lamentable thing is that so many derive real pleasure from watching. But as I said the movie is not really about boxing as about a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds, or the fates, if you will.There are only three characters of any real consequence, Frank, Maggie and Frank's sidekick Eddie, who provides a mordant commentary on the story. Frank, as played by Clint is gnarled and tough, yet not quite tough enough. Guilt-ridden, he grieves for his estranged daughter and Maggie fills the gap. Hilary Swank as Maggie, despite the deprivation and loneliness, is all brighteyed ambition. We are never allowed to dwell on the improbability of such a character; instead we nod approvingly as she storms into Frank's twilight years, batters opponents senseless and gets into the ring for the big one. It's a remarkable performance and Hilary might as well have the Oscar, in a lean year. Morgan Freeman is very comfortable as Eddie the commentator in what is almost a repeat of his performance in 'The Shawshank Redemption'.The trouble with Gothic Romance is that we know from the start that the protagonists are going to fail no matter how hard they try. Their failing is not a function of some fatal flaw in their make-up, but because the Universe is against them. Failure is thus reassuring. Clint however points out that this should not stop us from trying. Maggie at least gave it her best shot. For her, the ride was worth it. .",Null,1,2,6 March 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Grim but absorbing
","This is a grim and gritty tale lightened somewhat by an upbeat ending. Its origins as the first novel in the millennium series by Stieg Larrson is evident in a somewhat meandering storyline and a running time of two and a half hours, with the inevitable excisions from the book. Nevertheless the film stands up well on its own.Sweden seems to produce detectives at the end of their tethers, 'Wallander' for example, and the protagonist here, Mikael a journalist, starts out facing three months in jail for defaming a shonky business tycoon. I thought criminal defamation was a thing of the past, but not it seems in Sweden. Mikael has been set up, but the case has brought him to the notice of Henrick Vander, the patriarch of an old industrial family, who commissions Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his favourite niece, who disappeared from the family's island retreat nearly 40 years ago. Mikael joins forces with the tiny but intimidating Lisbeth, an ace computer hacker with a dark past and an agenda of her own.They soon discover that the Vander family, except for their client who is a nice old gent, are as about a dysfunctional a family as you might ever meet, on a par with the Essenbecks of Visconti's 'The Damned'. There are skeletons everywhere, not just in the closet. However Mikael and Lisbeth crack the case, after the usual quota of menacing moments and dashing around chasing red herrings and actual clues. Filmed in the midst of a Swedish winter the atmosphere is pretty gloomy, not to mention just plain cold.Michael Nyqvist inhabits the role of Mikael pretty comfortably, spending quite a lot of time looking surprised, but Nooni Rapace as Lisbeth is something else again – practically an elemental force – never was someone so vulnerable and so dangerous at the same time.Nit-pickers will be delighted to learn that in a short sequence set in outback northern Australia, Mikael's FWD has the correct licence plates and its steering wheel on the right. However the lighting was most peculiar and the sheep a bit out of place – you mostly see cattle in northern Australia.There are apparently two sequels in the pipeline, and despite some rather grisly moments I will line up to see them. Larrson, who died suddenly after producing three best-sellers, was a good storyteller and the film-makers have executed the adaptation with plenty of skill.",8,21,31,16 February 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Good luck to George Clooney
","It's no wonder Hollywood is regarded by the American Lunar Right as a propagator of evil. Here's Gorgeous George Clooney, veteran of many a popular lightweight entertainment, using his money and position to attack that misunderstood patriot, Senator Joe McCarthy, long after he has faded from the scene. The trouble is, of course, that Georges' timing for his retelling of the efforts of the country's most famous broadcaster, Ed Murrow, to expose McCarthy for what he was, could not have been better. The same question that Murrow canvasses in a 1958 speech which bookends this production faces us today  is the enormous power of the electronic media going to be used for proper public education and discussion, or just to sell soap and peddle propaganda. It has to be said, though, that the US networks, probably now more competitive than the comfortable tri-opoly of the 1950s, have been more critical of conduct of the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism than they were of McCarthy when he was around.This movie, appropriately in black and white, feels like television. Apparently the original intention was to do the piece live, as George did a few years ago with his re-make of 'Fail Safe', but sensibly that was not attempted on this occasion. The sets are small and crowded and full of movement. It seems early TV studios at least at CBS in New York, were tiny and Murrow (David Strathairn) practically sits at the end of the camera lens. His producer, Fred Friendly (played by George Clooney), sits close enough to tap him in on the leg as a cue.Their program, 'See it Now', on CBS Sunday night 6:30 to 7 pm gave the viewers some pretty challenging stuff, but the ratings suggested viewers could cope. Clooney has for dramatic effect rather exaggerated the problems Murrow and Friendly had: Alcoa, a major sponsor did not pull out until at least a year after the McCarthy program, and not as a result of it, as suggested in the movie. It should also be borne in mind that Murrow, reasonably expecting that he and CBS might be next, made a pre-emptive strike against McCarthy, and the junior Senator for Wisconsin's weak, inarticulate and ineffective response lost him much support.I was very interested in the scenes between William S Paley, the former cigar salesman who was chairman and chief stockholder of CBS, and Murrow. Paley is no Hearst or Beaverbrook, nor even a Katherine Graham, and, as played by Frank Langella, despite being an intimidating and large man comes across as rather timid, deferring, most of the time to Murrow's evident moral authority. Perhaps it is because Paley is in a licensed industry, dependent on the Government and Congress to operate, or perhaps Paley realises he can always get rid of Murrow if he has to, and in the meantime it is better to leave him alone. In the end Murrow did leave CBS and when he died of lung cancer in 1965 he was the Director of the US Government Voice of America radio service. His ideals as a broadcaster live on in National Public Radio and the PBS television network (of which Fred Friendly was a founder).As a piece of drama, the film works very well. The atmosphere is very like that of 'All the President's Men'  although we never feel for Murrow and Friendly in the way we do for those cub reporters Woodward and Bernstein. In 1953 Murrow was a national icon; the Washington Post guys were unknown. David Strathairn underplays the part beautifully, though he does not quite get Murrow's cadence. The triumph over McCarthy comes at a cost, as we see toward the end.Anyway, more power to George. If he wants to spend his fortune on 'message' pictures of this sort, he's welcome. Even better, if he can make money doing it. He might be a limousine liberal, but at least he's at the wheel with a firm idea of where he's going. Murrow might not have approved of some of the editorialising but I'm sure would have agreed with the sentiment.",8,2,4,18 December 2005
Mulholland Drive," A master chef - but a Chinese meal of a movie
","Mulholland Drive is a long and twisting road through the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains, and this film has as many twists and turns as the road. It is not however as scenic, nor does it give such a good view of LA, or Hollywood, the dream factory. The first hour and a bit hangs together reasonably well, but then there is a paradigm shift  the characters assume different identities and we seem to be in a different story. The second story is wrapped up, sort of but what about the first? If it's a dream, it's a lot to watch without an ending.David Lynch is obviously a real smartarse. It's as if he was giving a class on how to out-Hitchcock Hitchcock. His use of slow walks with the camera and spooky music to build up suspense is terrific and he is great at injecting humor into unlikely places; there are some really funny moments. Betty's first screen test is a hoot. In fact there are lots of Tarantino-style magic moments. The film is replete with references to greats of the film noir genre - it is a very film-literate piece. The two main protagonists, Betty the wide-eyed ingenue and 'Rita' the amnesia victim are vividly portrayed by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring. The trouble is you have be a smartarse yourself to appreciate the movie. I suppose mind-games can be entertaining, and this movie is filled with incident, but despite its length I walked out feeling it was a Chinese meal of a movie  the need for entertainment was not satisfied for very long.",Null,1,1,3 March 2002
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Visually splendid and fairly faithful remake
","Former Disney animator Tim Burton has a rather hit and miss record as a film-maker but he usually has a firm grip on fantasy and does Roald Dahl proud here. He sticks pretty close to the original story except for an interesting if not wholly successful attempt to flesh out Willy Wonka's background, with Christopher Lee playing Willy's father. All the children save Charlie are monuments to defective parenting and of course all get their come-uppance. Charlie is of the deserving poor but wedded to his family and is duly rewarded.The production values can hardly be faulted. Money and a vibrant imagination is a potent combination. The exterior of the chocolate factory, the squirrels' nut-cracking room, the chocolate river ride all linger in the mind long after. Only the Bucket house, too comically dilapidated to be true, struck a false note (the other buildings were generally realistic  even the chocolate factory could have come out of the same architect's office that produced the Battersea power station). The Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers could have been done by Busby Berkeley, though he would not have been able to get by with only one Oompa Loompa (here computer graphics provided the rest).The acting was perfectly fine; I only hope the children escape the oblivion which awaited the child actors in the 1971 film with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I enjoyed particularly David Kelly, his subtle Irish charm turned on to full, as Grandpa and James Fox as Veruka Salt's ramrod-straight but weak dad. Johnny Depp denies basing his characterization of Wonka on Michael Jackson but there is an uncanny resemblance. His Wonka has also a touch of Howard Hughes and even overtones of Henry Ford  industrial autodidacts who did things their way, meeting with both spectacular success and failure. In this film his shyness is more apparent but he could not be described as child-like except for his love of candy. The Mars family of candy bar fame are pretty reclusive  though it's probably not because they are shy, just mega-rich.This is a kid s movie and the members of the target audience I saw the film with evidently enjoyed it. For me it was a visual treat. The story and the atmosphere are almost intact though I'd suggest reading the book first, or hearing Roald Dahl read the story on tape/CD.",7,2,3,22 September 2005
The Insider," inside story on tobacco whistleblowing scoop a lesson for journos
","'Insider' was a lot better than I expected, much more thoughtful and absorbing than the schlock thriller suggested by the trailer. At two hours 40 minutes it's far too long for a thriller and we could have done without the trip to Lebanon to see the head of the Hezbollah, but we do get an intelligent analysis of whistleblowing.Whistleblowing is full of pitfalls, and internal whistleblowers tend to get it in the neck. Jeffrey Wigand, former Brown & Williamson head of R & D, here at least survives with his integrity intact, though he loses his family. To the press he is a person - until the next story comes along. America's 'free' press is generally thought of as being pretty fearless, but this story (largely true, it is claimed) shows a media giant, CBS, being stopped in its tracks by a legal side wind. As if 'tortious interference with contractual relations' could stand in the face of the First Amendment after the US v Nixon. The alternative explanation - worries about the effect of a lawsuit on the value of executive stock options - was much more plausible.The disclosure itself really came as no surprise - that B & W, a big tobacco company, retained a proven harmful ingredient in cigarettes to keep customers addicted. It also came as no surprise that all the tobacco company CEOs perjured themselves before a congressional committee when they swore that they did not believe nicotine was addictive. In fact the only real reason for trying to shut Wigand up was as an awful example to other insiders who might be contemplating similar moral outrage.Russell Crowe, aged suitably, portrays Wigand as very focused but rather emotional man who has difficulty in both expressing and dealing with his feelings. Strangely enough his true metier turns out to be teaching. Al Pacino as the investigative TV journalist Lowell Bergman is a much more straightforward piece of acting. Bergman is not very susceptible to self-doubt - the faults he rails against are in the news institution he serves. Christopher Plummer plays the '60' Minutes anchorman Mike Wallace as somewhat of an egomaniac (you can see why the real Mike Wallace didn't like the portrayal) who, more used to getting his own way, was allegedly rather more prepared to bend to his corporate masters than Bergman was,.At the end, the fictional Mike Wallace redeems both himself and CBS. Some of the minor characters are beautifully done also, such as Michael Gambon as the sinister southern gentleman B & W CEO and Gina Gershon as the super smooth CBS in-house counsel whose iron-clad poise Bergman manages to disrupt.It's interesting to compare the 'wives' in the story. Mrs Wigand is the traditional supportive housewife, and she crumbles under the strain (which is considerable, death threats, bullets in the letterbox, financial stringency and worries about two small chidren). Bergman's partner, admittedly not under quite the same pressure, with her own job and perspective, acts as a useful sounding board for Lowell. It seems if you want to have a really supportive partner you should have someone with a bit of emotional independence.Big tobacco certainly has a lot of clout but it has since been brought to an accounting of sorts with the US$250 billion settlement in the States' lawsuit (which has a role in the movie). What I find truly amazing about the US political system, though, is the way quite minor lobbies can paralyse government action, for example relations with Cuba. For the sake of two or three congressional seats in the Miami area the US government keeps Cuba in the deep freeze, to the long-term detriment of both countries.On journalism, it was nice to be reassured that those who do their work properly get the better stories. The New York Times was happy just to print Bergman's leaks to it on arguments within CBS about airing the Wigand story. The Wall Street Journal (ficticiously prompted by Bergman) got a much better story when it checked out the 500 page dossier on Wigand prepared and distributed by his ex-employer and found that much of it was false.",Null,0,1,14 February 2000
The Graduate," A romp from the sixties
","Watching a movie you last saw 36 years ago can be a disconcerting experience; disconcerting because so little of it is familiar. However I can remember how I felt about this one  emotional memories seem to be recorded in stone  and my reaction today is to a large extent the same as it was in 1968. `The Graduate' was and is no more than a pleasant light-hearted romp through the pretensions of the US upper middle classes via one of their bored (and rather boring) children. Of course back in 1968 I empathised with Benjamin, now I rather see Mrs Robinson's point of view. Neglected by her spouse, battling a drink problem, her beauty fading but her sex drive unabated, she just does what comes naturally. Seducing Benjamin is like shooting fish in a barrel, but Mrs R is not the sporting type. The relationship is both doomed and deeply authentic.The second relationship between Benjamin and Elaine is not so well established despite Ben's stalker-like pursuit. Elaine, though prettily depicted by Katharine Ross, is an ill-defined character and it's never clear what she sees in Ben. Perhaps the final scene in the back of the Santa Monica bus is the give-away  she really isn't sure why she's run away from her wedding to the hearty medical student and Ben is starting to wonder whether his feverish pursuit of Elaine was a good idea either. They've kicked over the traces and gone for `liberation' (very 60s) but what next? A mortgage and a job for Ben in plastics or more likely with IBM (or if he were really lucky, a precursor of Microsoft) and a divorce after Elaine realises she has fallen into the same matrimonial prison as her mother?The odd camera angles and heavy symbolism look a bit hackneyed nearly 40 years on, but the comedy is not too ponderous and the film has a crisp feel to it. The better comedy is in the first half and things flag towards the end but Nichols wisely kept it to 95 minutes. The director was greatly assisted by two stellar performances, Anne Bancroft as Mrs Robinson of course, and Dustin Hoffman, who was just perfect as Benjamin the priggish bore, who finishes up causing an amazing amount of emotional damage through `self fulfilment.' As for the music, well, it's a great LP, but it doesn't always work well in the movie  the excellent lyrics clash with the banalities of the script - the characters are seriously banal people.Well, here's to the sixties, Mrs Robinson, and Jesus knows they won't come again.",Null,2,3,4 February 2004
Pride & Prejudice," Another spin in the Austen
","Ah! Another spin in the country in the old Austen! Here we come, Hertford, Kent and Derbyshire (and a few other locations as well). The two most striking things about this version of 'Pride and Prejudice' are the liveliness of the direction and the exuberance of the cast. Keira Knightley, whose flawless beauty at 20 years old can stand the closest of close-ups, can act as well, and, despite the odd anachronism in Deborah Moggach's script, she gives us an appropriately spirited Elizabeth Bennet. Matthew McFadyen ('Spooks'), battling against the definitive image of Colin Firth in the role in the 1995 TV version, gives us a Darcy to compare, if not match.The Bennet family is a lively, noisy lot and Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet manages to make her something more than the comic upstart matchmaker of previous versions. I thought Donald Sutherland as a Canadian Mr Bennet something of an anomaly (it was very hard to expunge memories of Benjamin Whitrow in the role) but even if he does not quite convince as an English gentleman with a large family and in reduced circumstances, he handles the fond father bit very well.The minor characters do not disappoint either; Tom Hollander does a superb Mr Collins, a little man in every way, and Judy Dench, although more of a termagant than a monster of aristocratic hauteur, packs plenty of punch as Lady Katherine De Bourgh, Collins' patroness and Darcy's aunt. I didn't care for Rupert Friend as Wickham the cad, who seemed to have wandered in, pony tail and all, from the set of a another movie, but Simon Woods gave us a nice eager, but not over bright, 5000 a year Bingley, the catch for sister Jane.There are lots of people, lots of dancing, busy muddy farmyards and crowded market places. This is a very busy, bustling film as the makers shoehorn the novel's story into less than two hours, but there are some occasional moments of tranquility, including one scene where Elizabeth, standing on top of a rock, dress fluttering in the breeze, gazes out onto the rugged landscape. It was a straight steal from somewhere  a version of 'Wuthering Heights' I suspect.This is entertainment and not Eng Lit. Not all the best lines are there but the necessary production values are  good acting, fine costumes, well-paced direction by Joe Wright, good locations, dynamic cinematography and appropriate music (if at times a little too well played to be authentic). Really, there's not a lot to complain about, certainly not while Keira Knightley is on the screen.It is a paradox how a series of novels so specific in their time, place and social milieu can have such universal appeal. Austen has been exploited in all sorts of ways by film-makers, from the straight re-telling of the story as in the 1995 TV version of 'Pride and Prejudice' to the embedding of the story of 'Emma' in the teen flick 'Clueless' (not to mention the Indian version 'Bride and Prejudice' and the shameless rip-off of 'Bridget Jones' Diary'. Not doubt Jane herself would have remarked 'It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single film producer in possession of a good budget must be in want of an Austen script'. There are a few miles left in the old Austen yet.Note, for our transatlantic readers 'Austin' was an English make of uncharismatic motor vehicles which after 70 years of production faded away in the early 90s.",8,1,7,22 October 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Mind has its reasons
","Caution: Semi-Spoiler AheadMany more movies like this and a new term is likely to enter the critic's lexicon, 'Kaufmanesque', defined as 'somewhere between reality and fantasy, and aimed at somewhere around the human heart'. Charlie Kaufman's script for 'Being John Malkovich' was mostly fantasy, but involved, apart from a couple of comic turns, some only slightly bizarre people. 'Adaptation' apart from a possibly imaginary twin brother, was an essay in Hollywood metamorphosis, as a piece of sober non-fiction reportage is turned into a crummy action movie  nothing fantastic there. This movie involves only slight fantasy  the routine removal of unwanted memories by electronic means (does not every computer keyboard have a delete key?), and the central characters are as human and vulnerable as you might find in a big city like New York.While his earlier scripts had straightforward time lines here Kaufman and his director, Michel Gondry rocket back and forth through a series of flashbacks to explain what really happened between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslett). Joel in particular wants to forget the pain but remember the good bits and this interferes with the process. The whole thing is very artfully constructed and makes sense in the end but you have to keep your wits about you there are several different versions of the same incidents and some of the incidents are dreams rather than actuality.Somehow the actors seem to be able to get out their performances despite the flashback high jinks and in the case of Joel and Clementine well-rounded portraits appear. They are opposites of course, Jim the introvert who hardly ever buys clothes and Kate the extrovert who changes her hair colour once a week. Jim Carrey, so often in noisy, eye-rolling roles, puts in a restrained and credible performance and Kate Winslett is convincing as the brash and upfront Clementine. The minor characters such as the technicians Ray (Mark Ruffalo) and Patrick (Elijah Wood)) verge on the comic though Tom Wilkinson is nicely low-key as Dr Mierzwiack of Lacuna Clinic, who devised the memory erasure process. The good doctor turns out to have a past, but it is more mundane than one might have thought.Visually this is quite a stylish movie the beach snow scenes and some of the dream sequences are vividly appropriate. At one point Joel is in his mother's kitchen as a four year old, hiding under a giant table  we forget how small we were as young children. Lacuna operate from what looks like a suburban medical clinic using nothing more elaborate than a CAT scanner and laptop computers; there is no attempt to be sci-fi flash (though the headgear Joel wears during the erasure process looks like it was left over from a 'Startrek' episode). You can forget your past but you are still the same person that helped create it. Not remembering, you are likely to repeat yourself. This being the case, this movie does not really have a surprise ending, but Kaufman and Gondry have produced a very attractive and imaginative love story, despite the somewhat difficult format of the picture. As no doubt readers of these columns will be aware the title comes from a poem by Alexander Pope. It's worth bearing in mind that Pope was talking about a Vestal Virgin  a professional virgin, in fact. Spotless minds are for virgins. If you engage in living a full life, you are bound to collect some psychic cuts and bruises on the way, and you are probably better off keeping the scars.",Null,0,2,25 April 2004
Alice in Wonderland," Not much Carroll, but a visual treat
","This film reminds me of one of those recipes where you take all the pulp out of something like a red pepper or an eggplant, chop it all up, add lots of other things, stuff it all back in and bake the stuffed object at a high temperature for a goodly time. The result is interesting but doesn't bear much relationship to the original. Technically the film is a sequel rather than an adaptation of the original books by Lewis Carroll, but while much use is made of the physical aspects of Carroll's characters the essence of the books, the absurd logic and the teasing ideas is displaced by a fairly conventional kid's adventure story – Avatar for the under 12s.Nevertheless the whole thing is visually splendid and beautifully rendered in 3-D. Mia Wasikowska is a gorgeous 19 year old Alice and the supporting cast of great and famous British and (odd) American actors can hardly be faulted. Even 92 year old Michael Gough popped up as the voice of the Dodo. Anne Hathaway's make-up made her look more like a New Orleans brothel keeper than the White Queen, and Crispin Glover's Stayne was less comic than was called for, but by and large the main parts are very well done. Johnny Depp as the only mildly Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red ('off with his head)' Queen were right in character and Stephen Fry positively purred his way along as the Cheshire Cat.We might have all read the books in this case, but Tim Burton was not out to give us a faithful adaptation. Disney as producers has not always done well with Alice in Wonderland – an interesting animated version which followed the books closely tanked in 1952 – and this time the studio was taking no chances. The few kids at the screening I saw seemed to like it well enough but there wasn't quite the enthusiasm I saw in 'Avatar.'",7,0,3,25 March 2010
The World's Fastest Indian," A decent tribute
","Invercargill, New Zealand, is noted for being the country's southernmost city and for having the least hours of sunshine and the most number of rain days of any NZ large town. It is also famous for being the home town of a gritty old codger called Burt Munroe who set a number of world motor cycle speed records (one of which still stands) in the 1960s at Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, riding a 1920 Indian Scout motor cycle.Roger Donaldson, one of the midwives to the renaissance of the Kiwi film industry in the 1980s ('Sleeping Dogs', 'Smash Palace') and latterly Hollywood director ('Thirteen Days'), made 'Offerings to the God of Speed' a documentary on Burt in 1972, when he was still alive. This dramatization of the same story  little man triumphs though sheer grit and determination  is a triumph for his star. Anthony Hopkins is good at quirky curmudgeons but here he manages to exude a little homespun charm as well. His Burt has the happy knack of getting people to help him rather than shaft him. Officialdom melts at his approach and he is even attractive to the ladies, as Burt would have put it. It's Tony Hopkin's film and he carries it off in fine style. I'm not sure about the accent which is more northern British than southern NZ but it hardly matters as the Americans in the film can scarcely understand it anyway.The rest of the cast were all adequate and Aaron Murphy as Tom the kid from next door was actually able to steal some scenes. I also noticed an old acquaintance in a minor role as Frank the bike club president - Tim Shadbolt, student radical of the late 60s and now mayor of Invercargill. Burt had no money but he did get community support at various times, so Invercargillians can take some pride in his achievements.Which brings me to what I think is the hole in this account. The Indian motorcycle, which was a light machine used for dispatch and scout work in World War One, had a top speed, according to the makers, of 57 mph. It had a V-2 cylinder block design and a decent capacity of just under 1000cc. Burt was a backyard mechanic who constantly tinkered with it, even casting his own pistons, which blew with monotonous regularity. Somehow he got the thing to exceed 200mph. No doubt the streamlining helped, but he must have modified the original design radically. Donaldson presents this without any explanation. Maybe Burt wouldn't tell him, or maybe Donaldson thought too much tech stuff would put the punters off. It wouldn't have taken much to explain it.As others have said, this is very much a 'feel-good' movie and I think, as an ex-resident of NZ, evocative of some of the more admirable aspects of the NZ character  the optimism, the friendliness, the capacity for improvisation and the willingness to rise to a challenge, and even occasionally to take risks. Burt had a lot in common with those pioneer settlers from Scotland who arrived in Southland 100 years earlier and founded Invercargill, a place the Maori sensibly regarded as a trifle too chilly to actually live in (though they visited for the oysters and muttonbirds). But he also had some home-grown attributes as well. .",8,7,7,14 April 2006
Avatar," A visual feast
","Newspaper resident right-wing spleen merchants have written this movie off as a product of James Cameron's hippie sensibilities (Nature good, Civilisation bad) but the plot is so ordinary it is not likely to have much persuasive value. Visually it is something else. With Planet Pandora (technically a moon), Cameron, inspired by the Amazonian rain forest and Jurassic Park, not only has created a 3-D world of beauty and splendour, he has staged some truly spectacular action sequences, particularly in the air (Harry Potter and his flying broomsticks on steroids). The average viewer is going to be swept away by this, not by the clunky plot, which revolves around a mining venture on a distant planet being obstructed by the locals who are justifiably upset by the intrusion.What upsets the Right's cheer brigade is the 'simplistic' portrayal of the military as moronic thugs, when we have all those brave men and women out there defending freedom and our oil supplies price in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since this is a science fiction fable the analogy is likely to be lost on most viewers – they are more likely to see it as a steal from 'GI Joe'). As Jake Sully, the central character who changes sides in the battle, Sam Worthington is not a traitor to his race, as the cartoonish Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang) calls him, but someone who realises that what is being done to the planet and its people in the quest for 'unobatinium' is morally unjustified. Perhaps our columnists would like to take a look at what has been done to the environment and population by mining in New Guinea, for example.Leaving aside the politics, Sam Worthington has just the presence for his part. It was nice to see Sigorney Weaver, an old hand in Cameron movies, back as the crusty but likable scientist Dr Grace. I also liked Giovanni Ribisi as Selfridge the mine manager once I realized he wasn't Jerry Seinfeld. He was the epitome of the corporate shyster. The unsung heroes of all this are the animation and special effects people , hundreds of them including Weta of NZ, who have put their experience in Lord of the Rings to good use.To revert to the political, we might ask why there is an apparent 'left wing' bias in Hollywood movies. The answer of course is that the Right have no imagination, a vital attribute for a successful innovative movie maker. Cameron might write clunky plots and corny dialogue, but there's nothing wrong with his visual imagination, and he has the ability to engage the primal fears of his audience, if not their intellects, and to entertain.",9,1,3,2 January 2010
The Artist," A silent for today
","This is a very cunning piece of work- original only in its audacity- a tribute to the silent era in the shape of a silent movie about the era's end. What Michel Haznaravicius has done is to re-arrange the clichés of the early pictures to produce a film perfectly watchable by today's audience. The Academy went overboard and gave it five Oscars (best movie, director, costume, music and actor) but, hey, this is a movie for those who love movies. Apparently it cost $15 million to make and was filmed in 37 days, recovering nearly three times that at the American box office alone. Being silent (apart from the rich musical soundtrack) it should do pretty well in non-English speaking markets as well.The artist himself, George Valetin (Jean Dujardin, made for the part), is a combination of Douglas Fairbanks senior and Errol Flynn (the latter of course did not start in movies until the early thirties). Handsome, dashing and acclaimed, as his career tanks with the advent of talkies, he finds refuge in the bottle. Meanwhile his one-time fan Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) prospers in the new medium, especially in song and dance.Silents were a repository of family values and this is reflected here – I don't remember seeing more than a chaste kiss between George and Peppy. Supporting characters like James Cromwell as George's faithful chauffeur inhabit familiar roles. One thing this movie does not have is a baddie - no damsel in distress tied to the train tracks. John Goodman (delightful as always) the cigar chomping studio head is merely recognising the inevitable in laying off George who himself proves the point by producing a spectacular box office failure. Incidentally, it is the Wall St crash which wipes out George financially though his production failure would not have helped.What this film does superbly is put today's viewers in the seats of the silent cinema. ('Silent' is something of a misnomer since the showing was usually accompanied by music, though not usually as elaborate as here) As a time capsule this film is near perfect and no special knowledge is needed to understand it. We are kept enthralled despite suspecting we might be in for an upbeat ending. The whole thing is well done. Maybe there was more drama in the Descendants, but Oscar did at least recognise here the superb production values – an Artist's film indeed.",9,3,5,17 March 2012
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A film, not a history
","'Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow' wrote James Joyce. Well, a lot of us Irish piglets have managed to escape the maternal jaws and prosper abroad. A film like this, on the Irish war of independence (1919-21) and the even bloodier civil war which followed it (1922-23), is thus both remote and yet oddly personal. Ken Loach's take on these battles, forgotten in Britain but well remembered in Ireland, is not even-handed, but he is a movie maker, and a very good one, not an historian.The central character played convincingly by Cillian Murphy is Damien, rather improbably a medical graduate from a village near Cork, who is about to go off to work in a leading London Hospital. He is persuaded to stay and joint the local IRA column commanded by his brother Teddy after witnessing a couple of petty atrocities committed by the British forces, the Black and Tans. The IRA steal weapons from Army depots, ambush British columns, shoot informers, and bring down on the general population reprisals which have a ferocity which far outweighs the IRA's mayhem. The population, having had enough, vote in favour of a peace treaty, which excludes Northern Ireland from the new Irish State, but the hard men of the IRA, some of them socialists as well as Nationalists, go on fighting, this time against some of their own former comrades, in Daniel's case against his own brother.Ken Loach tells his story simply and vividly, with not a surplus scene, though he allows some of his characters lengthy and didactic speeches. He goes for authenticity in the lighting, which means greens and browns dominate almost every scene. (We could have done with some sub-titles  the soft Cork accents are difficult even for another Irishman to hear.) His characters, though, tend to be types rather than people, Damien the idealist, Teddy the pragmatist  they are not rounded out characters but vehicles for the argument. What Loach does get across (though I am not sure he intended to) is the inevitability of the tragedy of the civil war.The pro-treaty party won the civil war, but nearly a century later the dispute remains alive. Ironically, the South is now ridiculously prosperous while the North still languishes economically. Ironically also, parts of the anti-treaty party (Fianna Fail) under Eamon de Valera survived to become a dominant force in Southern Irish politics. Loach's account of the 1920-22 period is both a clear statement of the issues and an evocation of how it must have felt to have been involved. We Piglets can feel what our grandparents must have felt when the IRA and the Black and Tans came by.",7,4,6,1 October 2006
The Red Violin," Five aimless tales of a fiddle in red
","This is a 'portmanteau' movie, with five separate stories involving the same violin on a three century journey from its creation in Cremona, Italy, to its sale at auction in modern-day Montreal. The auction ties the stories together, sort of, but the viewer is still left with a feeling of discontinuity since the object, beautiful and possessed of a fine tone, is still that, an object. The music is interesting and pleasant but can't replace the lack of a strong storyline. The story of the violin's creation is a bit poignant, but mostly trite. The second story, the sad tale of the child prodigy from the Alpine orphanage, has the most impact, but ultimately is pointless. In the third story, Jason Flemyng does a terrific Chopinesque musical Lothario, reminding us that the 19th had its brattish pop stars, but his sticky end is a bit pointless too. Greta Scacchi does make a nice femme fatale though. The fourth story, set in Mao's China at the time of the Cultural Revolution, is pretty dull. The ending, at the auction, is pretty silly.Back in the 1960s, the director Anthony Asquith, did something similar with a motor car in 'The Yellow Rolls--Royce' (his last movie). There was a fair bit of sexual hanky-panky in and around the Roller but that seemed fitting. The stories were separate but on a similar theme, love, sex, betrayal. This film, on the other hand, says something about creative passion, but I'm not sure quite what - maybe how hard it is to control, to channel productively. It also says, if you want to get money out of five different film funders, give 'em five different plots. Oh well. The crew(s) must have had a good time.",Null,0,0,27 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Vale Stanley
","Was Kubrick a maker of popular Hollywood films who masqueraded as an art film auteur, or a giant of the cinema who liked to break even on a picture? This one certainly indicates he liked to do things his way, but it is an entertaining film nevertheless, despite the length (160 minutes) and the stately pace.I think Kubrick's widow Christine got it right when she said 'Eyes Wide Shut' is about fear. In this case it is the fear that one is missing out on something forbidden but delicious, or perhaps the fear that one has failed to achieve true fulfillment despite all the conventional trappings of success. Dr Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) has it all - society practice, luxurious Manhattan apartment, Range Rover, beautiful attentive art curator wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) and cute small daughter. Bill is motivated to find what he's missed by Alice's confession that she had been prepared to give him and everything else up for a handsome naval officer she merely saw across a crowded room at a resort months ago. Fueled by mental images of Alice cavorting with the officer, Bill goes out to find whatever it was he's missed. The journey is an interesting one with Kubrick doing his usual stringing together of set pieces/cameos to reach a rather maudlin but vaguely cheerful conclusion. The unjustly notorious orgy scene is absurd rather than erotic but some of the scenes between Bill and Alice are as intimate as one gets in cinema.Kubrick was like Hitchcock in using detail to telling effect, though unlike Kubrick, Hitchcock knew when to stop. Tom Cruise breaks down and cries at one stage, probably because Stanley had asked him to do the scene for the 101st time. The detail is truly extraordinary. Just one example. In the opening scene, Alice is naked in front of a mirror above her dressing table and Bill, also naked, moves to caress her. On the dressing table are a few books. On the top is Alan Bullock's biography of Hitler and Stalin. A conventional enough tome to find as a young NYC doctor's bedside reading. The next book down is a biography of (the still living) Lord Longford. Lord Longford? He was the eccentric peer who launched a futile campaign against pornography in Britain in the early 1960s including among his targets Kubrick's film of Lolita. This reference is in the only mildly erotic scene in the whole film. A Lolita-like character makes a brief appearance later on and the angle offered will not amuse the politically correct, or Lord Longford, if he is still watching.Detail is used for dramatic effect, not realism. Thus Bill gets on the Interstate to get to the country estate where the orgy is being held and winds up in England. Stanley plays fast and loose with the locations. The exterior is Mentmore in Buckinghamshire, built by the Rothschilds, some of the interior is Highclere in Hampshire, another fantastic Victorian pile, and the orgy scene is set in a Moorish style room in Elveden, the Guinness family mansion in Suffolk. The plot doesn't bear close examination but the script is workmanlike and the minor performances enjoyable. You can see why actors liked to work with Kubrick despite his reputation for inordinate pains - he always gave the bit players a scene to steal (with Peter Sellars in 'Dr Strangelove' being a multiple offender).As for the leads, Tom Cruise ('it's OK, I'm a doctor'), although playing the character we see the film through, doesn't quite project a personality the audience can relate to - somehow it's hard to empathise with him and his obsession. Nicole Kidman is fine - yes of course she can act. She is particularly good early on, at a posh party, fending off while sloshed an oily would-be lover. Sydney Pollack as Victor, their wealthy and sleazy friend, is a standout also.Well, that's Kubrick. His older films stand up amazingly well (eg 'Paths of Glory', 'Dr Strangelove'). He was one of the few eccentric individualists of the cinema who actually did their best work on their own. With this film, he went out on a strong note, and I'm sure I'll enjoy a second viewing almost as much as the first.",7,0,1,8 August 1999
Inside Man," Clever crime caper
","This is a clever crime caper comedy/drama from Spike Lee with authentic NY atmosphere (you can almost smell the bagels and coffee), astringent dialogue, and a hole in the plot you could drive an armoured car through. There is fine acting from a mostly obscured Clive Owen as the chief robber and a brown suit-wearing Denzil Washington as the lead cop, with significant contributions from Jodie Foster (in a rather improbable part of a super fixer), Christopher Plummer (suavely villainous as usual) and Willem Dafoe (cast against type as the most sensible person in the NYPD).A bank siege is one of the great movie/TV clichés but this one is off-beat enough to hold the viewer's interest, despite going on too long (125 minutes) and having too many diversions  though we are spared too many sub-plots. Some nice camera work is helped by 'cosy' production design  it's an appropriately crowded film. The intercutting of the story with post-robbery interrogations, done without giving the game away was a clever touch also.The hole in the plot? Well, again without giving the game away it seems the robbers are not so interested in the bank's money as in the contents of a certain safe deposit box. We not told how they found out about it, but the contents, we are told, will severely embarrass the respected elderly citizen whose box it is (and who happens to be the chairman of the bank). But ask yourself, why on earth would the person concerned have kept this particular incriminating document? It has no value to him. He has no incentive to keep it. Yet he keeps it in the box for 60 years. Has he got a death wish? Have I missed something?",8,1,1,26 March 2006
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Fast cockney crime comedy
","Four not very likely lads in a  bloody cockney comedy crime caper relying on speed and timing to disguise an implausible plot and some moral ambiguities. Some great lines and a cliffhanger ending, but the characters are not very involving. One or two suitably grotesque villains but most of the crooks the fab four come up against are as thick as two short planks. I did appreciate the occasional sub-titles and was amazed at the amount of bad language in a British film.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Delightful adaptation of wizard novel
","This was a pleasure to watch. Eager fresh faces, a galaxy of veteran British actors, sparkling photography, a sympathetic main character, a truly brilliant set piece (the Quiddich match), plenty of action, a pleasing combination of the real and the fantastic in set design and plenty of appropriate special effects. It was amusing to see the absurdly pompous ground floor of Australia House in London as the banking chamber of Gringott's Bank. I'm afraid to say the people behind the counter in real life are just as unsympathetic as the goblins of Gringott's. It must be the architecture.It's always nice to see British acting veterans getting well-paid for once, though no doubt none of them will do as well out of this film as Alec Guinness did out of 'Star Wars'. Most of them give value for money here, even when, as in the case of Leslie Phillips, they appear as voice only, or, in the case of John Cleese, are allowed only a ghostly presence. Richard Harris is rather restrained as Headmaster Dumbledore but Maggie Smith gives us a suitably stern but kind Professor Mc Gonigall. Alan Rickman is splendidly twitchy as the suspect Professor Snape and the lesser-known Ian Hart is subtle and effective as Professor Quirrell, keeping his real role in the proceedings concealed until almost the end. I guess if David Warner had done the part we would have twigged right away. Robbie Coltrane is delightful as Hagrid. I was going to say 'unrecognisable', too, but his bulk does rather give him away. Hagrid has a fluid job description , but his role seems to be that of school porter and all-round friend to the pupils (the school caretaker is no friend to the pupils). Richard Griffiths as the awful Uncle Vernon reminds us that not all fat people are lovable.The kids are also a delight, though one or two look like they have strayed off a Roald Dahl movie (Harry's cousin Dudley for example). The central three, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson), bounce well off each other, though I wonder what will happen when Harry's and Ron's hormones rise and they realise how drop-dead gorgeous Hermione is.I'm not a fan of the private school ethos, and boarding schools in particular, though I admit to consuming boarding school fiction many years ago. The charm here lies in the combination of artless fantasy with the institutional life of a school. I wonder about the social isolation of Hogwarts  all these bright young misfits in one place where they do not feel that they are freaks. There is also the exclusivity and the superiority surrounding their status as wizards, looking down their noses at us muggles. It's all a bit like medical or law school in fact  the arrogance generated is not always professionally advantageous.Anyway, there are still lots of terms to go at Hogwart's and we can only hope they remain as fresh and as entertaining as this one.",Null,0,0,26 June 2002
Mystic River," Clint goes for law 'n order
","A chillingly well-told tale from Clint Eastwood and some fine actors, with no concession to sentimentality. I can just imagine the studio executives going `hey Clint, you're going to depress the audience' and Clint replying `that's the idea, bub. The plot concerns three youngsters growing up in working-class Boston (south side?). The life of one of them, Dave (Tim Robbins), is irrevocably changed after he is kidnapped and held for a few days by two very nasty child molesters. As adults the three become involved again in the course of a murder investigation headed up by another of the three, Sean (Kevin Bacon) in the territory of the third, Jimmy (Sean Penn).The film takes a very strong stand against paedophilia and also, interestingly, vigilante justice. In the end justice is not done in a situation where it could have been. After all those films in which the (relatively) good guy took justice into his own hands, Ol' Clint is now saying `support your local sheriff.' Perhaps his spell in elected office (Mayor of Carmel, California) has had something to do with this.The acting is fine, particularly Sean Penn as Jimmy the local storekeeper/hoodlum who has a complex range of emotions to go through. Tim Robbins as Dave came over as a shellshock victim but Kevin Bacon was excellent as Sean the persistent, if not perfect, detective. There are also fine supporting performances from Marcis Gay Harden as Tim's wife and Laurence Fishburne as Sean' sceptical sidekick (though anyone as sceptical as he was wouldn't last long as a sidekick).The atmosphere, helped a lot by the locations, was suitably gloomy and gritty, and Clint has used a few of his signature devices such as the camera going for a brief roam over the landscape (and harbour scape) in between scenes. It's not a happy story, but it is a gripping one  anti-Hollywood but with box office appeal. I guess once you get to Clint's age with his experience you might as well follow your instincts about what works in a movie. The execs can go sell the ice creams.",Null,0,0,12 February 2004
A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Actor, maybe
","Ron Howard, a Hollywood veteran who started as a child actor, has been working his way up as a director from featherweight material ('Splash', 'Cocoon') to more dramatic subjects ('The Paper', 'Apollo 13'), though with a fairly light touch ('Edtv'). Here he has come up with a sanitised biopic of John Nash, the brilliant but schizophrenic Princeton mathematician who won the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on game theory done many years earlier. Being an old hand, Howard knows no-one never went broke not challenging his audience's intelligence and the significance of Nash's work is explained as a strategy for picking up women in bars. Russell Crowe as Nash keeps it as obvious as he can, with lots of muttering and strange moving about. Naturally there is a love interest in the form of Nash's wife, played nicely by Jennifer Connelly, and some loyal friends, but unfortunately some of Nash's imaginary friends are more interesting than the real ones.It would be interesting to know just how much work Nash really did for the Pentagon as a breaker of military codes. It is implied the code-breaking work, which he did after obtaining his doctorate, helped push Nash over the edge, but it emerges that he was suffering from delusions even before he left Princeton. Howard's little trick of holding back on the truth about Nash's true state of mind does help us to see things from Nash's perspective, but it also confuses the story. The really interesting thing, which is not adequately explored, is the genius/madman interface. We have plenty of mad people but not too many geniuses, so what is the relationship? All Nash knows is that, stuffed up with pills he may not suffer from delusions and keep quiet but he is not good for much else  even his sex life suffers. The early inappropriate treatment, insulin shock 'therapy' from Dr Rosen (Christopher Plummer) gave way to less catastrophic medication, but it seems his best work was done before he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. In remission, he was allowed to hang around Princeton and eventually was able to write and teach again, but the early genius does not seem to have returned. Princeton it seems got a bargain  a Nobel Prize from someone who was too cracked to put on the full-time payroll.Because this is a strictly commercial movie it has to be judged on its entertainment and box office value rather than its contribution to human thought. Howard is quite adventurous in serving up to the great movie-going public a biopic of someone from such an arcane area as pure mathematics, but he does not fail them  there is enough sentiment to satisfy all and a tiny kernel of intellectual interest to satisfy the tiny fraction of us who like that sort of thing in our movies. Russell Crowe, who apparently did not meet Nash until shooting was finished, does a sort of madder version of his 'Insider' character. Crowe and the make-up people handle the aging of his character well (not so Jennifer Connelly who is unrecognisable in her last scenes) but because most of the drama is earlier on, the last few scenes set years later fall a bit flat. 'Enigma' (not yet released in the US) is a much more exciting mathematical espionage story, albeit an old-time thriller. No doubt Oscars will be won, and Howard acclaimed as an artistic genius for what is really just stolid Hollywood entertainment.",Null,0,2,24 March 2002
The Holiday," Love, improbably
","Iris (Kate Winslett), attractive, if somewhat dowdy, young English journalist (she works for that citadel of fogeyism, the 'Daily Telegraph'), on the rebound from an affair with the shiftless Jasper (Rufus Sewell), one of the paper's columnists, decides she needs a Christmas holiday. She goes on-line and has soon swapped her Christmas-card pretty, but cramped, Surrey cottage with a mansion in Bel – Air owned by Amanda (Cameron Dias), the ebullient head of a company that makes movie trailers, who has just thrown out her latest useless partner. The girls swap places and in no time Amanda is romancing Iris's dishy brother Graham (Jude Law). Meanwhile in Hollywood Iris is getting to know Miles (Jack Black), a workmate of Amanda's, and a 90 year old neighbour, Arthur (Eli Wallach) who happens to be one of Hollywood's forgotten great writers.One can of course dismiss this sort of stuff as glossy fairy floss because basically, despite all the money and talent expended in making it, that is what it is - 'Love, Improbable.' This film is rather long for its genre, over two hours, and it does drag a bit, as if the scriptwriters couldn't decide how to end it. However it must be admitted that Kate Winslett and Jude Law are always interesting to watch on screen and Cameron Diaz has a nice line in parodying some of her earlier performances. Rufus Sewell shows he can out-act Hugh Grant any day (not hard I guess). Jack Black on the other hand seemed strangely out of place as Ms W's love interest – romantic comedy doesn't seem to be his forte, he's more of your gross-out guy. It was nice though to see Eli Wallach, a great Hollywood tough guy of old, who at 90 seems to have the market for nice old buffers sewn up, as the neighbour.Perhaps I am setting my standard too high, but compared to 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Notting Hill', 'Bedrooms and Hallways' and even 'Love, Actually', this was a pile of mush, far too sweet and sticky and nice. Good comedy needs a certain bite, a reality bite, a bit of astringency, whereas what we are given here is pure fairyland escapism. Writer/Director Nancy Myers has a record of light entertaining stuff ('The Parent Trap', 'Father of the Bride') and she certainly is not trying to extend her range here.",6,84,130,9 February 2007
Love Actually," A Christmas dessert
","This Christmas confection from Richard Curtis is a pleasant romantic comedy, with an unusually complicated plot (8 couples involved), plenty of pace, and generally good-natured humour. Hugh Grant is so absurd as Prime Minister (even in the age of Tony Blair) he almost gets away with it. Intelligent script and some recognizable people, but when you get down to it, just some very commercial entertainment with more f words than you would usually expect. Colin Firth was a perfect pain as usual, everyone else was fine, and Bill Nighy, denizen of so many dodgy roles, excelled as the aging rocker revitalizing his career by sending himself up. Even my dear old Mum enjoyed it, though she thought it `a bit pornographic'.  Well, with lines like `it was Christmas, and everybody came' what do you expect?",Null,0,2,17 February 2004
There Will Be Blood," An oilman's story well if slowly told
","Director Paul Thomas Anderson, 'inspired' by Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel 'Oil' and the career of Californian wildcatter Ed Doheny, has combined with the fine British actor Daniel Day Lewis to produce a truly remarkable character, Daniel Plainview, oil wildcatter and horrible human being. While Sinclair, a lifelong socialist, attacked capitalism overtly, Anderson is more subtle; he concentrates on the effect that the unbridled lust for wealth has on one man.We are told little about Daniel Plainview's background. He came to the West from Fond du Lac,Wisconsin (as did Doheny), probably off a small farm, spent some time working for the US Geological Survey, where he picked up some expertise in mineral location, and by the time the film opens (1898) he is mining for silver in New Mexico. Mining was and is a hard, dangerous business, and when one of his employees is killed in an accident Daniel takes custody of the man's infant son. Daniel strikes oil and by 1913 has several producing wells. His big break comes when Paul Sunday (Paul Dano), a farm boy from Southern California estranged from his dirt-poor evangelical family, tells him about oil seeping from the ground. Daniel swoops down on the family, buys their miserable property, starts drilling and hits a gusher. But this wealth is not without its costs.Daniel, who admits to his erstwhile 'brother' that he dislikes most people, is a driven man who will do anything including murder to achieve his goals, and he makes John D. Rockefeller Senior, the ruthless founder of Standard Oil, look like a gentleman. Starting out as a small time wildcatter he eventually aligns himself with the big boys, Union Oil of California, having been exquisitely rude to their opposition, Standard Oil. But wealth does not buy him happiness; by 1927 he has come to resemble Charles Foster Kane, alone in his huge mansion (in fact the one Doheny built for his son), alcoholic, rejecting his son, and in despair.This saga is told in a leisurely fashion and some viewers will find the pace (stately) and length (2 hours 40 minutes) daunting. Daniel Day Lewis creates an enormously forceful character though we are left to work out for ourselves how he got that way. His Daniel is not religious though he pays lip service to the evangelicals along the way. His 'spiritual' opponent, the Sunday's other son Eli (also played by Paul Dano), a Pentecostal preacher, turns out to be two-faced and the film ends in a final confrontation between the two.I'm not sure who the villain is meant to be - atheists and believers can both be ruthless capitalists  it's up to the rest of us to make sure they do not get out of hand. Even so, the film is an impressive achievement from a director previously known for small, quirky movies like 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia'. The cinematography is wonderful  you can also smell the oil - and the musical score atmospheric. Above all, the film captures the mood of the times. Now, of course we have to stop burning the stuff.",8,3,6,24 February 2008
The Last King of Scotland," At the court of King Kong
","Giles Foden, who wrote the novel in which this film is based, spent his formative years in Malawi, the president of which at the time was another sinister African dictator, Dr Hastings Banda (who, oddly enough was once a GP in Glasgow). In the book, however, he looks at a far more colourful figure, Field Marshall Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC etc, president for life of Uganda, from the point of view of a young Scottish doctor, Nicholas Garrigan, who is plucked from a remote mission hospital to be Amin's personal physician and adviser.There is some factual basis for this in that Amin did at one time have a Scottish doctor and he also had as a close adviser a former British army officer, Bob Astle (who Foden interviewed living in retirement in Wimbledon) but essentially we are looking at fiction, based on the premise what would it have been like to have been a young, impressionable, rather feckless and sexually adventurous doctor working for Idi Amin.At first, being at Amin's court is a pretty heady experience for young Nicholas (who as played by the elfin James McAvoy with early 70s long hair seems to be a teenager). Beguiled by Amin's hearty manner and flattered by his attention it's almost too late before Nicholas sees the dark side. He is reckless enough to sleep with one of Amin's wives, not realizing that Amins's spooks are onto him. The climax, during the Entebbe hostage crisis, is bloody and gripping.Forrest Whittaker had a difficult job playing Amin; because Amin was given so much air time by the media when he was in power he is a very familiar figure. Yet Forrest gives us the core of the man, bluff, hearty, childlike (and hence really scary, as Nicholas observes), given to rages, absolutely ruthless, and as time rolls on, increasingly paranoid. It's a wonderful performance and has to be a strong Oscar contender, though perhaps not the certainty Phillip S Hoffman was for 'Capote' last year. James McAvoy's extremely youthful looks don't help, but he manages to develop his character so that the feckless youth does seem to develop into a more thoughtful and responsible person. There were also several good minor performances such as Kay Washington as Kay Amin, Abby Mukiibi as Masanga, Amin's taciturn security chief, and especially Simon McBurney as Stone the British spook, who sees Nicholas as a ready-made British agent. Unfortunately Nicholas is Scottish and does not take kindly to Stone's superior English manner.Kevin Campbell the director is best known for his documentaries, particularly his mountaineering saga 'Touching the Void'. Here he filmed in Uganda, which helps authenticity, but he has also produced an interesting story. Amin is superficially charming, but thrust into power he becomes a monster. Nicholas can't initially resist the charm, but comes to realize he's dead if he doesn't. Nicholas is not the nicest of young men, but in the end we don't want to see him as a victim.Uganda has had a rocky time since Amin was deposed (the old monster died in exile in Saudi Arabia in 2003), but despite AIDS and a nasty insurgency now has some semblance of law and order and modest economic growth. Hopefully it will never have another Amin, who came close to destroying his country, despite his entertaining manner.",8,11,12,18 February 2007
American Gangster," Familiar but well told story
","Gangster movies usually bore me witless ('The Godfather' and 'The Sopranos' apart), but Ridley Scott is an interesting director and the story here is derived from real events. The style of the film is busy  there is often far more going on the tightly edited scenes than the viewer can take in at once - but as it progresses things fall into place and the two parallel stories of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas and incorruptible New Jersey detective Richie Roberts eventually merge. As Lucas, Denzil Washington puts in his usual solid performance, and Russell Crowe, with a rather less interesting character- the only thing unusual about him is that he is an honest copper- fits the role perfectly. What is more, he speaks every line audibly, an object lesson to some of today's fashionable actors who all seem to think they are Brando. The gang members here, though, just about need sub-titles, and there are so many it is difficult to keep track of who's who.Much of the story  set in the period 1968 to 1974  is familiar to those of us around at the time  US army personnel smuggling pure heroin from SE Asia back to the US of A in coffins, police corrupted by the vast amounts of money involved, the rise of black crime bosses. The movie doesn't dig too far into motivation  greed is accepted as sufficient. Frank Lucas's gang operates as a family business, with five brothers and numerous cousins in the organization but he keeps almost all the money for himself, resenting paying even $10,000 a month to bent coppers while amassing $250 million in offshore bank accounts. His boldest ploy was to cut out the middleman and buy pure heroin direct from a surprisingly urbane ex-Kuomintang general hiding in a remote South-East Asian jungle (probably Burma). His customers got Frank's 'Double Blue' heroin at twice the strength for half the price. This of course killed more people, but Frank never seems to be short of customers.Without giving the game away it can be said that Richie is fairly successful in his efforts against the heroin trade, but others, some selling other drugs, sprang up to take Frank's place. Ridley Scott doesn't go into the issue, but this story clearly shows the futility of treating drug abuse as a criminal law rather than a public health problem. Unfortunately the puritanical origins of the United States are still reflected in public attitudes towards addiction. The addict is a sinner and must suffer to be redeemed. Punishment is more important than rehabilitation, and drug dealers are beyond the pale altogether (actually I would go along with the last bit as long as it included tobacco company executives). Anyway, as I said, Ridley Scott stays clear of the issue. He gives us a familiar story, cleverly framed and well presented.",8,0,1,19 February 2008
The Reader," An adaptation that adds something
","Salman Rushdie, in an essay on adaptation, remarked 'Something is always lost in translation; and yet something can also be gained.' This film adaptation from Bernhard Schlink's novel directed by Stephen Daldry, previously known for 'Billy Elliot' and 'The Hours' loses some of the depth of the novel, but at the same time Kate Winslett brings alive the central character of Hanne, the former SS guard in her thirties who has a brief affair with Michael the narrator when he is 15 years old far more vividly than Schlink was able to in the novel. David Hare's screenplay follows the novel fairly closely, but Kate Winslett, often by body language alone, is able to tell her character's story so as to make her understandable, if not forgivable. David Kross and Ralph Fiennes, the two actors playing Michael, who grows up to be a stiff legal academic (boy, do I know the type) also do a remarkable job.The more stringent critics would say that nothing can be said in defence of Nazism, but they rather miss the point. Schlink and the movie makers are trying to explain why people can behave in such a terrible way, not to excuse what they did. Are the critics saying that Hanne should not have been portrayed as a physically attractive woman? Because she is attractive we can more readily accept that the narrator, at 15, will fall in love with her. He is, of course at that stage completely unaware of her history. He does not even notice that she cannot read. Later, when he knows the full story he is indeed consumed by guilt, but it his not the affair he is guilty about, but his failure to help her, his betrayal in fact.This segues into the larger question of how can the post-war generation of Germans come to terms with what was done by many of their parents. Neither Schlink nor the film makers have an easy answer to this. Schlink writes 'Whatever validity the concept of collective guilt may or may not have, morally or legally – for my generation of students it was a lived reality.' It did produce a generation who were anti-Nazi. Schlink again 'It converted the passive suffering of shame into energy, activity, aggression.' As to losses in translation, the most irritating change was to recast the linear structure of the novel into flashbacks, which added nothing and made the story harder to follow. Some of the earlier scenes with Ralph Fiennes as the older Michael don't make much sense. But Kate Winslett carries the day with a gutsy and convincing performance.",8,2,3,31 March 2009
The Wrestler," Wrestling with fate
","I saw this film only a few days after seeing Daniel Aronofsky's acclaimed ballet movie, 'Black Swan', which may well propel the hard working Natalie Portman to a well-deserved Oscar. I thought it was a brilliant but rather cold and nasty piece of work. In this earlier film, notable for the resurrection of the wayward Mickey Rourke's career, the approach is much more sympathetic. In both films Aronofsky gets the audience inside the main character's mind – in fact we hardly go outside it. Mickey's Randy the clapped out wrestler is a familiar figure. and not difficult to understand. Pro wrestling as practiced in the US is entertainment rather than sport, but Randy's body can no longer put up with the physical abuse involved. Randy knows this, yet he cannot embrace retirement, or at least life in alternative employment, in his case behind a supermarket delicatessen counter. He also has personal issues, an estranged daughter and his relationship with a pole-dancer, the latter played by the always interesting Marisa Tomei.Mickey puts in a faultless performance. His Randy exudes bravado but his aggression is well under control. In his quieter moments he shows gentleness and sensitivity. Unfortunately his propensity for hell-raising interferes with his personal relationships, though his ring performance is less affected. We know things are not going to end well but they do end neatly.The world of pro wrestling is not seen in a glamorous light and the film is unlikely to boost trade. While we get a very clear picture of what might drive a competitor like Randy in this business, I was at the end of the day no clearer about what motivates the audience. Is this some survivor of a more atavistic age where people derive pleasure from seeing others bashing each other up? Boxing, in comparison, is much more structured and physically skilled. In pro wrestling we seem to be satisfying some pretty primitive desires. Randy the Ram knows what his audience wants and will just about kill himself to give it to them, but the audience won't really care if he dies on the job.'Black Swan' packed a bigger emotional punch than 'The Wrestler'. Yet I felt for the wrestler but not for the ballerina. Aronofsky is one of those directors who can coax a stunning performance out of apparently ordinary actors, and there must be a long queue outside his casting agency.",8,0,0,14 February 2011
Inception," A multi-layered action fantasy
","This movie is the product of Christopher Nolan's considerable imagination. Like 'Memento', the story springs from an interesting speculation, in this case what if it were possible to get inside people's dreams, either to steal information or to plant suggestions as to future action. In the story, Leonardo's character does this for a living. He is retained by a large corporation to implant the idea into the heir to a rival corporate behemoth the notion that he should break up his father's empire and set up on his own – actually quite reasonable career advice (see Murdoch, Lauchlan). Nolan's trick is to film not only the dreams of the characters, but dreams within dreams and even dreams within dreams within dreams. The dreams turn out to be pretty action-packed, so that at times the whole thing seems in danger of becoming an application to direct the next James Bond movie. However despite about 90% of it being set in dreamland the story manages to emerge and there is a satisfying resolution.There are shootouts, car chases, attacks on fortresses and vertigo-inducing scenes in lift shafts and special effects galore (the Paris folding street scape is a standout), but not much in the way of sex. There is romance of a kind in that Leonardo pines for his late wife, their life together being the subject of several flashbacks. For reasons which become apparent, Leonardo can't return to the US, but this job might change all that. Michael Caine, who seems to be popping up all over the place despite being 79 has a supporting role as his mentor. As far as I can tell he is the only significant character who doesn't appear in a dream.I certainly hope that no-one tries tinkering with my dreams, but as they never seem to make much sense and don't as far as I can tell direct what I do day to day it might not be a profitable pastime. I suppose it might be different for someone who took them as auguries or guides to the future. The Generals of Myanmar would be a good bunch to start on.",8,0,5,22 September 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Upbeat prison drama
","Film Review: The Shawshank Redemption (from a novel by Stephen King) The tale of the banker (Tim Robbins), who, given life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover, adapts to prison life using his native wit, as told through the eyes of another lifer (Morgan Freeman). Absorbing plot, interesting relationship between the two leads. The prison system (of Maine) exposed as brutal and corrupt, the chief guard (sadist) and the warden (sanctimonious bible basher) are particularly nasty. Setting the story between the 40s and 60s makes it a little easier to believe. Fairytale ending.Conservatives might argue all the brutality is justified in making prison a deterrent, but that hardly excuses the murders by guards and embezzlement by the warden. Of course the same people will contend insider trading keeps the stock market efficient  laws are OK as long as they do not inconvenience entrepreneurs. What we see here is a criminal injustice system similar to that which prevailed in parts of Australia at the time (and probably still does). The public doesn't care and the politicians don't want to appear soft on crime, after all, only bad people go to prison. Actually, King accepts that some prisoners have done pretty awful things, and go on doing them in prison.So who is being redeemed? The problem is that Tim Robbin's character is a moral and upright character who should not be in jail  he has no need to forgive himself. Most of the other prisoners seem to think they are innocent, which makes 'redemption' hard for them. Perhaps Morgan Freeman's character eventually does, but at enormous cost. Anyway, it's a good yarn, and virtue (of a sort) does triumph, which is always cheering.",8,0,0,7 December 2008
The Queen," Queen for not much longer
","This is the very subtle and nuanced story told in an understated way, of how, immediately after the August 1997 death of ex-HRH Princess Diana as a result of a car accident in Paris, the Queen (Helen Mirren, brilliant) and Royal household were prodded into embracing the nation's grief by both public opinion and the recently elected Tony Blair (Michael Sheen). It's a fairly slight basis for a story but Stephen Frears manages to keep us interested by presenting it as a tussle between the Queen, who believes duty must come first and grief should be private, and Blair, who has to appease the tabloids and accommodate the people's grief. It's a tricky business putting lines into the mouths of actors playing living celebrities, given British (and Australian) libel laws and I can only recall one previous occasion where the Queen has been so portrayed, by Prunella Scales in Alan Bennett's brilliant play about the traitor Anthony Blunt 'A Question of Attribution'. Interestingly in France, which also has tough (pro plaintiff) libel laws, it is possible to put a real person into a novel and have them act badly without that constituting defamation, as long as it is clear the conduct is fictional.The Queen is not likely to sue, but she does not come out of this film too badly. She is shown as being perhaps more sympathetic to animals than people, but nevertheless high - principled and flexible enough to change her position to protect her interest, the standing of the monarchy. The same cannot be said for the Duke, portrayed here by the American actor James Cornwell as a grumpy hidebound stupid conservative, and the Queen Mum (Sylvia Syms), who seems to be living (just) in another century. Tony Blair too, does not come out so badly, at least if you accept it's OK for him to start out as a radical critic of the monarchy and wind up supporting it, much to the disgust of his wife Cherie (Helen McCroy, excellent). The person who really ought to sue is his press secretary Alistair Campbell who is portrayed very convincingly by Mark Bazeley as an enthusiastic amoral prat who will do anything to improve the PM's press coverage.The settings are appropriately sumptuous, including it seems some in Buckingham Palace, though Balmoral, where most of the action takes place was apparently off-limits and the film was shot in several other Scottish Highlands locations. I must admit the royal lifestyle  huge palaces, dozens of servants, every last detail of royal activities organized in advance, protocols for everything - would soon engender a certain remoteness of attitude, and it's a wonder the Queen is in touch with ordinary life as much as she is. From an Australian perspective however this film demonstrates that the British monarchy is something we need to put behind us  we still have it only because John Howard, our unprincipled and rat-cunning Prime minister who is still emotionally attached to it, managed to split the pro-republican vote at the 1999 referendum between those who wanted a directly elected president and those who were happy for the politicians to appoint one. Whatever value, spiritual and practical, the British see in their monarchy has no relevance here, and twenty years should see an end to it. In the meantime we can be entertained by perceptive, if not gripping drama such as this.",8,1,2,7 January 2007
Any Given Sunday," Stone's view of stone-age combat
","To us down here in Australia, American Football is a very weird game indeed. Played largely indoors on artificial turf by mountainous men armoured like riot police, every play pre-programmed and radio-controlled by the coach, an hour's play spread over maybe three hours, interminable time-outs and constant changes of personnel. Although it's `football' there's not a lot of kicking (of the ball that is). There's plenty of hard knocking though, especially on interceptions, which would lead to instant send-offs in other codes. There's also over-dependence on one player, the quarterback, for touchdowns, since most moves are programmed to get him the ball. The star system and rigorous teamwork are uneasy bedfellows.Oliver Stone, a pretty bombastic director at the best of times, is in his element here. He obviously loves the game (we see him, eyes bright, shouting `God I love football' in a small supporting role as a TV commentator), and at the same time, he wants us to share his disgust at various aspects of it  the commercialization, big business ownership, mistreatment of players (especially blacks who constitute 70% of major league players) etc. But Ollie is a showman first, and he puts on a great show for us, his handheld camera everywhere on the pitch, amplified crunches and groans as the behemoths collide, soaring passes, roaring crowds and tension, tension, tension. It's all artificial of course, but still a theatre with something to say about the human condition, if from a peculiarly American perspective. Strangely, we see nothing from the fans' perspective, though the reptiles of the press get some exposure.Da Coach, the central element in stories of this kind, is Tony, played by Al Pacino. It's a beautifully judged performance from one of the best film actors of the last 30 years and worth the ticket price alone. After 30 years he's over the hill, new, unsympathetic female owner whose inherited the team from her father, three straight losses in a row, his team hit by injury, trouble with a stroppy new quarterback, no other life worth mentioning, his family upped and left long ago. Al, in his world weary but intense style, makes this bucket of clichés worthy of our sympathy and respect.The rest of the cast are competent enough, Jamie Foxx as Beamen the new quarterback, and Dennis Quaid as the old one, standing out. I also liked James Woods as the unscrupulous team doctor stretching the Hippocratic oath to breaking point to keep players in the team, and Charlton Heston in a brief appearance oozed brutal power as the Football Commissioner. Cameron Dias as the rich young bitch owner was oddly weak  she never really rises to be a threat to Da Coach  and Ann-Margret as her drunken mother did not have a part worthy of her.So that's American Football at the turn of the century. My fearless prediction is that in 50 years time it will be played by robots controlled by computers linked to input devices under the fan's bums. The rest of the world will go on with the real mind game, soccer, while those primitives amongst us still in the Stone Age who like a bit of intelligent argy-bargy will be catered for by Rugby Union, Rugby League and of course, Australian Rules Football.",Null,0,0,2 January 2001
Casino Royale," Bond goes classless
","The critics will have you believe that this Bond is more like Ian Fleming's original character - the super-cool ruthless one-man assassination squad. As was said to the fictional press Baron by his (of necessity) sycophantic editor Salter, 'this is true up to a point, Lord Copper'. In other words, 'not really'. The original Bond was a projection of Fleming's own background (rich, upper-class, Eton, Sandhurst), snobbishness and tastes  fast cars, luxury goods, fine liquor, tobacco, disposable women and spying games - into a fantasy world in which he could be the ruthless man of action he never was in real life.Here, Daniel Craig as Bond is anonymous, classless, a cog in the governmental machine (though not always obedient), a character from 'Spooks' in fact who doesn't care whether his martini is stirred or shaken (the bar tender looks quite crestfallen when he say this). His hunky good looks don't look upper-class Brit and he looks like a gorilla in a dinner suit. He does convince in the action sequences.Speaking of those, they were exciting to watch, particularly the chase across the construction site at a port in Madagascar, but the tensest moments, and the ones nearest to Fleming's book, were the gambling sequences, removed from a small casino in northern France to Montenegro. In the book the game was baccarat, here it's a variation of poker. No doubt it would help to know the rules, but if you don't you just watch who scoops up the chips. Bond's opponent, Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen (very big on Danish TV) is quite good-looking and does come across as being only moderately evil; belting Bond's balls with a rope (Bond almost seems to enjoy it) isn't really on a par with Goldfinger's crutch aimed laser, and money laundering for African dictators isn't in the same class as blowing up the world a la Blofeld.The Bond girl is something of a throwback. Vesper Lynn (Eva Green) is certainly very beautiful and starts off by not liking Bond much, but she crumbles fairly quickly to his charm and becomes the maiden in distress he has to rescue. Bond manages to bed only two women in the whole show, one in the line of duty  it ain't the sixties any more. There is a perfectly fine 'M' from Judy Dench, but no Moneypenny or 'Q'. The great Giancarlo Gianni is tucked away in a minor role as MI6's man in Montenegro but the rest of the cast, who don't have a lot to do, are unremarkable and the cars have very minor roles  no Bentley and just a couple of Aston Martins. There are also some cameos of the 'blink and you'll miss them' variety such as Richard Branson at an airport security checkpoint.Despite the lengthy running time this was an easy movie to sit through. Having set-piece, seat-gripping action pieces intercut with quieter moments all in dazzling locations seems to have the peculiar property of making the viewer lose track of time, or at least lose track of how far into the story we are. The action peaks rather early, before the big poker game, and the Venice Palazzo bit at the end, ingenious though it is, comes almost too late. Still, most Bond films have been like that  a series of action sequences and an episodic plot (if any) and for that reasons not true to the books, which are about tastes and sensations and how it might feel to be a spy, at least if you are an upper class snob. Anyway, this Bond film is successful enough to ensure there will be another one. Look out Osama.",7,0,2,12 December 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Minor Woody Tale
","Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson), two American friends in their twenties, are holidaying in beautiful Barcelona prior to Vicky's marriage to the dull but worthy Doug (Chris Messina). They meet Juan Antonio, accomplished artist and dedicated Latin lover (Javier Bardem), who proposes going to bed with both of them, preferably at the same time. Cristina is keen, but passes out and it is the guilty Vicky who has a night of passion before marrying the unsuspecting Doug. Afterwards, Juan Antonio and Cristina get together, and, surprise, form a relationship. Alas, the idyll is interrupted by a blast from Juan Antonio's past, his homeless and unstable ex-wife Maria (Penelope Cruz). Juan Antonio can't bring himself to turn her away, and the three of them start living together. At first things go well, but then Well, the movie succeeds as travelogue. The locations are authentic and beautiful. The acting is fine, especially the two Spanish leads. But this is a slight story about two emotionally shallow and not very interesting Americans abroad. The real people are the locals. We are also kept at a distance from the characters by a bland voice-over. Perhaps Woody Allen, a long-time student of American sexual manners, is aiming to contrast the Spanish and (wasp) American approaches to affairs of the heart. The Spanish go for romance as if life depended on it, the American regard it as just another life goal, like a college education, or a well-paid middle-class job. The Americans are strangely discontented in the warm Catalonian environment, while the Spanish seem to belong there, which of course they do.I'm not complaining (it was after all a free in-flight movie being shown before the release date here) and it was lovely to see Barcelona again after 10 years, if only on the back of the seat in front of me, but I'd have to say Woody's best work is behind him. I saw Eastwood's 'Gran Torino' afterwards – now there's an ancient director who still can produce, as well as act.",6,0,3,2 March 2009
Amélie," Superbe soufle
","It would be nice to be able to review this film without using the words `fluffy', `French' and `confection' but it is all of these, set in a idealised `Gigi' style Paris where the only thing lying on the pavement is ripped-up photos from the ubiquitious instant photo booths. Ostensibly set in the present day, it's more like the Paris of fifties Hollywood  you expect Maurice Chevalier and Audrey Hepburn to appear and burst into song at any moment.The star, Audrey Tatou, is more than a little reminiscent of the earlier Audrey, but she propels the action to a much greater extent. Her character Amélie is naïve (to a degree) and shy, and works as a waiter in a café, but is adept at executing practical jokes. She is imbued with a desire to do good and manages to combine the techniques of joking with righting various injustices she sees about her. Things become more complicated when she becomes attracted to a young man with the rather strange hobby of collecting discarded photo-booth pictures. Her penchant for jokes and games becomes an obstacle to the relationship. Things work out in the end, of course, but there's lots of rushing about in streets and railway stations before the final kiss.The last French film I saw was `La Ville est Tranquille'. A very different film, it nonetheless had the same lightness of touch. Both give us the French as the directors would like us to see them, with a love of life that transcends petty concerns. It is unlikely that a German director would produce something similar, though perhaps an Italian one might. `Amélie' is full of comic turns  the hypochondriac tobacco booth saleslady, the elderly housebound painter, the bullying grocer and his put-upon assistant, the other staff and customers of Amélie's café, her concierge and various other street characters, yet it is very much Audrey Tatou's movie. She has an elfin charm that makes her look innocent even when engaged in sex and eyes any man could drown in.A souflé but a sweet one.",Null,0,1,29 December 2001
The Sixth Sense," Ghost story with heart
","American ghosts, like American gothic, seem to have been imported with a lot of other European cultural baggage into the New World (though the Indians had their own), but their basic modus operandi is the same. Ghosts linger after death only if there is some unfinished business, usually if they have died a violent death that remains unavenged. They are not terribly easy to communicate with. They are also guaranteed to drop the room temperature in the most overheated living room. And of course some people are much more sensitive to ghosts than others, having a 'sixth sense'.
Ghost folklore is put to good use here in what is really an exploration of the relationship between a child psychotherapist and his patient, Cole, a sad seven year old whose parents have split up and who doesn't seem to be coping well. For that matter, the psychotherapist isn't coping too well with his problems either, his failing marriage and the memory of a patient who killed himself after. But once the Doctor accepts that the kid is really seeing things he is able to help, and he realises at the end that he has helped himself a lot too. Although the whole film has a pretty sombre tone, set in a well-observed gothic but real Philadelphia the tourist brochures are not likely to feature, it finishes on an optimistic note. Sometimes the ghosts will be able to finish their business satisfactorily, and be on their way, leaving us to carry on our lives in our own way without being haunted by the past.Bruce Willis is cast as the Doctor. An interesting choice; he has been seen mostly as an action man zombie in violent thrillers (Die Hard etc). Here he is a zombie of a different sort, reflective, sensitive, concerned, guilt-ridden. He is greatly helped by a truly stunning performance by child actor Haley Joel Osment as Cole who communicates his character's pain so well we all suffer. You don't have to believe in ghosts to feel that no seven year old should have to put up with what this kid has to bear. In a lesser role, Toni Collette does a nicely observed caring but baffled mother, single, but coping (or would be but for Cole's problem). Olivia Williams rounds out the cast as the Doctor's wife, who, after flirting with the handsome help at her shop, takes to watching their wedding video when he's late home. Donnie Wahlberg (brother of Mark) also does a nice cameo as a deranged intruder.The writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, an ethnic East Indian brought up by his doctor parents in Philadelphia, (and who has a cameo role as an emergency room doctor here), has retold a truly ancient myth in a subdued and sombre style unusual in a mainstream Hollywood production. His handling of the scenes between Doctor and patient is quite masterly. At the end we are left with a simple but often forgotten truth: Our ghosts are about ourselves and once we recognise that we can deal with them.",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A brilliant production of a dour tale
","I'm lost in admiration at the effort required to produce something like this  the sets, the people, the horses, the computer graphics, not to mention the make-up, costumes and the catering. What comes out of all this is a spectacular but rather dour saga, the most memorable moments being rather small-scale such as Frodo's and Sam's climb up Mount Doom and the battle with the tank-size spider. I came away from the big battles not really sure how the good guys had won, though I suppose the ghost army helped in the last one.Ian McKellen, tall and snowy headed, made an impressive Gandalf, but the script did not allow you to find out much about his motivation. Frodo was easier to work out  he just wanted to stay alive and get home. In the end, of course, he succeeds too well. Like the Tolkien novel, the film takes itself very seriously. You don't have to believe in magic to enjoy this film, but it helps.As a former NZer I enjoyed the visuals, especially the city transplanted to the Rangitata river in Canterbury. The location is close to Mesopotamia Station where the English author Samuel Butler, in a profitable interlude as a sheepfarmer during the 1860s, wrote much of `Erewhon', his Utopian fantasy. Tolkien of course, a political reactionary did not believe in utopias but he did believe in heroism and destiny. Peter Jackson has managed somehow to assimulate Tolkien's ethic but it does make for stodgy viewing at times.",Null,0,0,8 February 2004
The Matrix," Cyberspace western
","I saw this one three rows from the front, which was a mistake. I also couldn't help noticing I was about the only person in the theatre over 25. (I really should have let my son go by himself.) Good computer game, confusing movie. Naturally loved the Sydney bits ('My God that's our building's lobby they're shooting up'). Noisy? Very. Spectacular? Moderately (don't care for the compulsory futuristic grunge). Profound? You're joking. Good acting? Keanu Reeves has his Stunned Mullet act down to a T. Unfortunately he was meant to be playing a Christ-like figure. Thought Laurence Fishburne is reasonably convincing in his 'John the Baptist' role and Hugo Weaving exhibits some evil glee as the multichannel villain. Romance? Well, there is the nice lady (Carrie-Ann Moss) in the plastic suit who says she loves Keanu, but doesn't everybody? Action? superabundance thereof. Not a high degree of accuracy (and pretty obsolete weaponry) in the shooting but of course that means the gun battles can go on longer. Inconsistencies. Yeah. Like how come you can only be teletransported using a fixed phone? Were not cell phones invented so we can all transport ourselves from and to anywhere? (Maybe its a bandwidth problem.) Recommended?

Thirteen Days," Brinksmanship American style
","Once again we have the American President as American Hero  the sound stages of  Hollywood must be littered with reproductions of the Oval Office. This time however we have a story based on a real event, the `Cuban missile crisis' of October 1962, when the Soviet Union commenced installing medium range nuclear missiles on sites in Cuba. President John F Kennedy imposed a naval blockade of Cuba and prepared U S forces to invade, but the Soviet Union backed down and agreed to remove the missiles in return for the U S secretly removing some obsolete missiles from Turkey some months later.
For those of us around at the time, they were exciting times, and Kennedy received high praise for his cool handling of the crisis. While not quite hagiography, this film puts the Kennedy brothers in a favourable light, Jack not giving in to military pressure for a pre-emptive strike and Bobby doing a fine piece of negotiation with the Soviet ambassador. Most of the other civilians involved come out well   Stevenson the U S ambassador to the United Nations who suggests the Turkey deal, Mcnamara, the Defense secretary, Rusk the secretary of State and Mc George Bundy, the national security adviser -  all play positive roles in ending the crisis. Only the CIA's McClone offered negative spook paranoia. On the other hand, the portrayal of the military top brass, in particular the Air Force chief of staff, Curtis LeMay (a fine performance by Kevin Conway) , made one thankful that their political masters were strong enough to control them. Otherwise there would indeed have been a nuclear armageddon.The story is told through a minor character, Kenny O'Donnell, the president's `special adviser,' in reality his appointments secretary, played by Kevin Costner (also one of the producers). O'Donnell certainly did have access to the president, having an adjacent office, but I suspect most of his role is fictional  he is more like an external projection of some of the thoughts going through Jack Kennedy's own mind as he grapples with the crisis. He is shown as having a crucial role, yet at the same time its not really his story and it would have been just as absorbing without him. The real interest is in the relationship between Jack and Bobby, and their struggle to marry geopolitical and domestic political priorities without triggering a nuclear holocaust. Bruce Greenwood doesn't closely resemble Jack Kennedy, but gives an earnest, if not particularly warm portrait. Stephen Culp as Bobby not only looks like him, but conveys exactly that almost desperate boyish enthusiasm and ambition Bobby Kennedy exuded.We see a bit of the military hardware in action  (there was a lot of sabre-rattling during the crisis but apparently only one death as a result) but the real focus is the discussions in the Oval office and the Cabinet room. It was a closerun thing  more than once Jack Kennedy nearly caved into pressure from the military for instant action.This is a worthy effort from Roger Donaldson, who once made warm cuddly New Zealand movies (eg `Smash Palace' 1981). It holds the viewers's attention for all of its 140 or so minutes, but it would be nice to know a little more about what was going on in the Kremlin. After all their records are now accessible. The ultimate irony of course is that the reviled Fidel Castro is 38 years later still in power in Cuba, having outlasted both the Soviet Union and 8 American Presidents. A Hollywood feature on Fidel, however, is not a likely prospect.",Null,1,2,5 May 2001
The Thin Red Line," A poem of a picture
","This film is three hours of movie poetry. 'Saving Private Ryan,' though brilliantly made, is a jingoistic cartoon by comparison. 'Thin Red Line' follows a company of American rifleman brought in to consolidate the Allied grip on the Pacific island of Guadalcanal in 1942 in the face of Japanese invasion, but the place could be just about anywhere where war is fought.The company is not made up of conscripts but regular soldiers. Some of them have been in the Army more than 10 years. Some of them however have never seen real action before and this is a hot and uncomfortable location, despite the lovely tropical scenery. Some crack up, some die, some do heroic deeds. Their leaders are not particularly admirable; one is quite happy to get his men killed if he can come out of the action looking good.Out of sight for most of the film are the Melanesian inhabitants, the Solomon Islanders, who are carrying on living as best they can while the war rages around them. Their serenity is in sharp contrast to the frenetic military activity. Of course, there is nowhere for them to go.There is some action excitingly filmed but as in real wars much of the time is spent preparing and waiting. Personal stories unfold but at the end it is survival that matters.The lighting and photography is quite superb, the lighting in particular fitting the mood perfectly. Filming was not actually on Guadalcanal but near Port Douglas in Northern Queensland where there is similar tropical rainforest and fauna but with much easier logistics. It took ages apparently but seems more than worth the effort.This is probably one of the four or five greatest war films ever made, right up there with 'All Quiet on the Western Front, ' 'Paths of Glory,' 'Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'The Longest Day.' Never has a movie better portrayed what it's like to be a frontline soldier.Terrence Malick has the reputation of being an eccentric, difficult director - Kubrick without the fear of flying. Yet this is not a particularly unconventional movie - it's just that everything hangs together - the story, dialogue, performances, photography and settings. On thing is clear - this is a better interpretation of James Jones' novel than the 1964 version.",Null,169,228,19 April 1999
Moon," A budget film trip to the moon
","Duncan Jones has delivered a real little sci-fi gem here. With a tiny budget he manages to get us to the moon, where a solitary Sam Rockwell is almost at the end of a three-year contract supervising an automated Helium mining operation. Sam has a HAL-like computer looking after him, but after an accident outside in a moon rover, HAL starts acting – well – protective. Sam is then confronted with - well – himself. Sam 2 is not a vision, unlike the apparitions in 'Solaris' which are the product of an alien intelligence, and the two Sams have to come to an accommodation before a 'rescue' mission arrives. The lunar mining base is hi-tech but shabby, in the way than mining camps tend to be. Gerty the computer which is attached but movable is particularly battered. Voiced in sepulchral tones by Kevin Spacey, Gerty has some of the menace of HAL from '2001', but in the end follows Asimov's first law of Robotics – a robot shall not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Without giving the plot away, it is evident early on that Sam 2 is a clone. He is also undoubtedly human – a clone is after all an identical twin born at a different time. Sam 2, though, is obviously programmed to replace Sam 1. How then should Sam 1 act? This situation makes for an interesting resolution. In a beautifully judged performance Sam Rockwell does a great job of his everyman in space role. We feel his loneliness and his longings. We also feel his fear, when it becomes clear that something is wrong, without any aliens or other monsters being present (the villains turn out to be home-grown). Duncan Jones makes good use of references to other great sci-fi movies but has added his own take on the 'man alone in the universe' situation. It's possible to pick holes in the story (would a mining operation crucial to the Earth's energy needs have only one human supervisor?) but the movie is so well executed you hardly notice. Maybe it's all moondust, but it's a clever piece of work.The science behind the story is sound; Helium-3 the rare helium isotope is both useful in nuclear fusion and more common on the surface of the moon than on Earth - we may well find ourselves using it as a source of energy one day.",8,0,3,2 November 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Colorful saga from a fast-changing land
","Danny Boyle is a versatile director, having done productions as diverse as Inspector Morse episodes, the mordant comedy-drama 'Shallow Grave', a celebration of the junkie lifestyle in 'Trainspotting, misadventures on the hippie trail in 'The Beach', plausible science fiction in 'Sunshine' and this colorful Indian romantic fable based on Vikas Swarup's novel 'Q&A'. It's Bollywood meets Hollywood all right, but there's also a little of the British Ealing comedy in it, where the good little guy takes on the bad establishment. He does so as a contestant in the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire'.A cynic might say that all we have here is another way to exploit the 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' franchise, since one of the production companies, Celador (now itself owned by Sony Pictures), also owns the TV show which is given plenty of screen time here. But Jamal Malik (Dev Patel from 'Sins'), 18 year old Mumbai slum dweller and and chai wallah tea boy) in a call centre, has non-monetary reasons for wanting to win the contest. He seeks instead to win the affections of his childhood friend, Latika (Frieda Pinto), a rose from the gutter who has fallen into the hands of an obnoxious gang boss, Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar).The story is cleverly framed around the quiz questions. Jamal gets each answer right because each question happens ('it is written') to be connected with an incident in his own life (fortunately more or less in chronological order). He manages to convince the policeman who has arrested him for fraud (how could a slumdog answer all those questions?) that he is on the level. The climax of the story is the last question. Unbeknown to Jamal, Latika is watching and - not far away.The two hours running time is filled with people, incident, noise and music. There's even an interlude at the Taj Mahal, where Jamal briefly becomes a (very) unofficial guide.) I note the film has not been released in India, and given the stark portrayal of some of the less attractive aspects of life there (police malpractice and corruption, communal violence, stinking slums and wide-scale gangsterism) I doubt it ever will  appearances are everything on the sub-continent. Unlike films such as 'Earth' and 'Water', serious pieces made for Indian audiences but banned or never screened there, Slumdog Millionaire, despite the almost all Indian cast and crew, is a Westerner's view from someone who knows how to make squalor entertaining. Danny Boyle doesn't care who he offends as long as he entertains. The last almost post-credits scene of hundreds dancing on the railway platforms to Abba-like music says it all. This is one cheeky film director. But in Noel Coward's words, he has a talent to amuse.I'm not sure what impact a film like this has on tourism  it might repel as many as it attracts  but one thing does emerge very clearly  India and countries like it (eg China) are changing faster than we imagine. Your correspondent recently spent a few days in Abu Dhabi. This Persian gulf oil sheikdom has gone from a few grass huts to a shining modern (if car dominated) city of nearly a million people in less than 40 years  most of the work having been done by 'guest-workers' from Muslim South Asia. Is it not possible that in 40 years time the slums of Mumbai will be history, just as Dicken's London has become?",9,0,2,27 December 2008
Gladiator," Swords, sandals and the meaning of life
","I wanted to see a Spanish language version of this just for the sheer pleasure of seeing Russell Crowe speak Espanol but unlike the French version this one was in English and subtitled in Spanish.Well, I have to admit this comfortably sized epic moved me. despite the battles, combat and crowd scenes the focus is on Maximus and his emotions as he goes from General to slave to slave-gladiator, losing his family in the process. He is up against Commodus, who unfortunately occupies City Hall, which as everybody knows is hard to beat. After Maximus loses his position at the start, avoiding death only through outwitting his executioners)he seeks revenge not just for himself and his family, but for the ideals of his late boss, Marcus Aurelius, emporer turned republican, who had chosen Maximus as his successor but miscalculated what his son Commodus would do when he found out.So what we get is a rather intellectual sword and slash movie, with good production values and an engrossing story. I couldnt help thinking that even a Roman crowd would blanch at the one-sided battles in the ring. No-one would bet, yet the bookies are shown as very active. The slashing is pretty graphic and its not clear how anyone would last five minutes, let alone be able to retire as Oliver Reeds character did to beome a manager. But the end was moving.As to historical accuracy. Im told by a real expert on the period that some of the characters are historically accurate (Marcus Aurelius, Lydia and Commodus (to some extent). There was a Maximus but little is known about him. Well so what? He enjoyed the show and so did I. Russ Crowe is definitive, Joquaim Phoenix as Commodus is a bit of a ponce but good at the evil bits. Richard Harris did a subdued Marcus Aurelius and I think we have to say Oliver Reed died a good death.",Null,0,0,10 August 2000
The Social Network," No-one owns ideas
","This is an intriguing movie, still fresh in my mind despite having seen it some weeks ago. I was surprised at the 'warts and all' portrayal of Facebook's putative founder Mark Zuckerberg, who, being now seriously rich, can afford the very best defamation lawyers. A good alternative title would have been 'Citizen Zuckerberg' though he apparently still lives in a nondescript suburban house and drives an old car.Several points stand out. First the film makers have rather ingeniously used as a framing device two separate court cases dealing with who really invented Facebook, the social networking site, which I am happy to say I do not belong to. Second, Jessie Eisenberg's performance as Zuckerberg is uncanny. It may or may not be true to life but it is absolutely convincing. His Zuckerberg is either afflicted with Asberger's syndrome or else is seriously weird, yet somehow we connect with him. Third, his opponents in one of the cases are the egregious Winklevoss twins, two of a vanishing breed – handsome rich WASP boofheads with an unshakable belief in their entitlement to privilege. They are also now seriously rich, though just a few days ago they lost an attempt in the Federal Court of Appeals to overturn their 2008 settlement with Zuckerberg. They are played by the same actor (Armie Hammer) who puts in two seamless performances. Fourth, Zuckerberg's treatment of his collaborator Eduardo Saverin, which leads to the other set of legal proceedings, is almost beyond belief. Fifth, all the litigation seems to be about a property right which does not exist, namely the ownership of ideas, though the lawyers try to dress it up by inventing contractual rights of doubtful provenance.As a film, however, this one works very well. The supercharged and chilly atmosphere at Harvard College, where the super-bright slug it out with each other and the super-rich is superbly realized. You may have allies, but no real friends. This writer has some experience of the law school at Harvard and it all rings true. I'm not sure the origin of Facebook can be put down to Zuckerberg taking revenge on the girl who dumped him; Facebook was one of those things whose time had come, though no-one realized its full potential at the time. The Winklevosses, snobs that they were, saw it as a Harvard only site, while Zuckerberg thought the Ivy League colleges were about the total market, though of course he soon discovered the world was his oyster.",8,2,4,22 January 2011
Cinderella Man," Packs a solid punch
","I find it mildly depressing that people will pay good money to watch two beefy guys trying to knock each other down in a boxing ring, but the spectators at a boxing match obviously derive a lot of atavistic pleasure from it. Inasmuch as it sublimates their desire to punch each other I suppose boxing serves a useful social purpose. You certainly can't blame a working-class stiff from New Jersey like Jim Braddock from using his fast right fist and high tolerance for punishment as a way out of grinding poverty for his family, and he was an inspiring figure for many in the 1930s. This is not a person trying to find themselves through fisticuffs like Hilary Swank's tragic character in 'Million Dollar Baby'.'Cinderella Man' (a title bestowed on Braddock by legendary journalist Damon Runyon) is a superior Hollywood biopic from journeyman director Ron Howard who previously directed Russell Crowe in 'A Beautiful Mind', a biopic about a more cerebral man, the brilliant and troubled Nobel prize-winning mathematician John Nash. Hence there is plenty of schmaltz and contrived emotion, almost to Spielbergian proportions, but there are also good production values and thus we get a fine recreation of the look and feel of the depression years in the urban US. There is also some fine acting.Russell plays Braddock as a fairly quiet, very stoic and steely determined man who sticks to his values throughout. An old-fashioned hero, in fact, with moments of desperation but not much self-doubt (and not much time for it either). He is an exemplary husband and father. It's a pretty low-key performance but well-judged. When he's not throwing telephones at hapless hotel desk clerks Russell can do a good job. Paul Giamatti as Joe the agent gives us a well-rounded character rather than a caricature and Renee Zellweger ably supports Russ as Mae Braddock.As this is a biopic, it can be revealed that Braddock eventually prevails and was world champion until defeated by Joe Louis two years later. In his championship fight against Max Baer (turned into a bad guy for the purposes of the movie via a wonderful bit of hamming by Craig Bierko), Braddock won by lasting the distance (all 15 rounds) just a bit better than Baer. There is a lot of actual boxing in what is quite a long film and we get to see about half the title fight. For me, the boxing scenes could have been shorter but as we know, people pay to see this sort of thing and Howard is not about to disappoint the crowd. The suspense is terrific, even if you know the result.But the last word has to be with Paul Simon:In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down or cut him 'til he cried out in his anger and his shame I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains",7,0,2,16 October 2005
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons you pay for
","Why a movie-length Simpsons? No doubt money had something to do with it (this film has grossed $US 125 million in the US alone in three weeks). The huge team of writers have not taken the opportunity to do much different from the usual string of gags, sight and otherwise, delivered at breakneck speed. There is a rather mawkish re-affirmation of 'family values', but then the Simpsons have always had a sentimental streak. When it comes to authority, subversiveness comes to the fore - the US Environmental Protection Agency will not be urging people to see the film  though small government advocates might.The sets and crowd scenes are a little more elaborate than those in a standard TV episode; the Alaska scenes are quite beautiful. Although the writers have produced witty and intelligent stuff they stop short of anything that might offend any sizeable portion of their audience. Religious belief is an example. Homer is not the fervent believer that Ned Flanders is, but he goes to church nonetheless. Casting a lovable central character as an atheist is simply not acceptable on US television.Lots of the secondary characters get a gig, but often a very short one. Baby Maggie gets to utter her first word, right at the end, in the credits, which, by the way, are just about the longest in cinema history and include a sizeable portion of the population of Korea, where much of the animation work was done. If you like the Simpson on TV you'll like the film, but it goes no further than an above average TV episode.",7,2,4,18 August 2007
All the President's Men," In praise of fearless journalism
","It was interesting to see Alan Paluka's fine film again only a few weeks before a presidential election (indeed I saw it as an alternative to watching the civilized but mundane Liberman  Chaney vice  presidential debate). After watching the Gore - Bush debate on Tuesday and Martin Sheen in 'West Wing' on Wednesday, not to mention Michael Douglas in 'The American President' a couple of weeks ago I was suffering from an overdose of political personae and the political process. This film, however, is about newspapers and how news is made rather than about politics. It focuses almost entirely on Woodward and Bernstein of the 'Washington Post' and their early digging into the minor burglary of the offices of the Democrat National Committee that became the Watergate scandal and brought down President Richard Nixon.It is based on Woodward's book and was made only a year or so after the scandal had subsided, but 24 years on in a different political era it is still an exciting tale of two young and not very accomplished journos who, spurred on by the fear of failure as much as anything else, and not too proud to do masses of boring legwork, provoked other people, especially the law enforcement agencies, to do the job they should have done in the first place. In the film, as in real life, it's the story that counts and not personalities, and we are spared any phony love interest or much glamourisation of the two reporters. Redford and Hoffman as the two reporters were never better and the two hours twenty minutes pass very quickly.Having recently also read the autobiography of Katherine Graham, publisher and owner of the 'Post,' I realized we were seeing Jason Robards rather than the real editor of the 'Post' Ben Bradlee, a much more cultivated character. However the film does reflect the general support the senior executives gave to 'Woodstein,' as Bradlee called them, despite the risks involved. Former Attorney-General John Mitchell's famous sinister remark about Katy Graham getting her tits caught in the mangle is heard and the Bradlee of the film makes a brief reference to being put under a lot of pressure by the story, but not mentioned is the strong evidence that the Nixon administration tried to damage the Washington Post Company by taking away its TV licenses. Graham had to think of her employees even if she was sanguine about losing some of her personal wealth. The United States is fortunate that a few of its major newspapers have private owners who believe they have a duty to inform the public as well as to make money. One wonders what Bradlee would have been forced to do if Rupert Murdoch had owned the 'Post'. Graham explains that casting her as a character was discussed and some interesting casting suggestions made, but eventually she decided it was better for her to stay out of it.Nearly 25 years later we still don't know the identity of 'Deep Throat', Woodward's furtive informer. Hal Holbrook, who plays the part as a prototype of the 'X Files' cancer man, has played several U S presidents but I think we can be sure that 'Deep Throat' was not Richard Nixon.June 2005 postscript. Now we do know that Deep Throat was the Deputy Director of the FBI, Mark Felt. Despite all the cigarettes, Mr Felt is, at 91, alive and reasonably well and living in Los Angeles. The surviving Nixon aides call him a traitor. In that case we need more like him!",9,1,1,5 October 2000
Up in the Air," A blast of welcome cold air
","This is a chilly comedy, and that's not just because the location filming was conducted mostly in the American mid-west in February 2009. Being sacked is seldom funny and Jason Reitman's use of real victims of the layoff process (along with some adroit actors) reveals some of the real pain of 'outplacement'. George Clooney's character Ryan Bingham is a master of the process. His company is hired by others all over the US 'too cowardly to do their own sacking' though given the ultra-litigious American scene there is a lot to be said for employing an expert to do the dirty work. Ryan's task as he sees it is to shepherd the victims on to the next phase of their lives (and cut down the litigation). It helps that he is a man without family commitments of his own who lives out of his suitcase 'up in the air' in the world of airports, hotels and rental cars, his only serious life goal being the attainment of ten million passenger miles with one of the better bits of product placement seen recently, the trusty American Airlines (did anyone notice the billboard at one airport with a photo of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, hero of the Hudson River ditching on it?) The tension here is provided by Ryan being forced to show the ropes to Natalie (Anna Kendrick) an eager young beaver straight out of business school who has given Ryan's smarmy boss Craig (Jason Bateman) the idea of replacing road warriors with the internet. The romantic sparks are not provided by her, but by Alex (Vera Farmiga), an older woman Ryan meets in his travels, a road warrior like him, who seemingly has no attachments either. Their affair blossoms, but, sorry folks, this isn't that sort of comedy.Rather, this is about as an intelligent piece of film-making Hollywood is capable of producing. Reitman's earlier movies, 'Thank You For Not Smoking' and 'Juno' were equally intelligent but here he has been able to create some depth of feeling, aided enormously by George Clooney's charm. He is exactly right for the part, and meshes perfectly with the beautiful Vera Famiga. I am at the stage of life where I find the likes of Natalie (a rollerblader, capable of going very fast in one direction) just plain annoying but I must admit Anna Kendrick does a good job to the extent that I almost feel sorry for her.Reitman was lucky with his timing here – as he filmed the US went into a financial crisis and slipped into recession. Millions have lost their jobs. As it happened, I watched the movie with my boss sitting just behind me. It was salutary to observe he was laughing at several points where I was not, but then again, I laughed at several points when there was silence from behind. Remember salary-men, their interests are not always yours.",9,0,3,24 January 2010
Atonement," A fine adaptation of a novel about guilt
","This is a very atmospheric adaptation of Ian McEwan's very moody and powerful novel, set in an upper-class English household of the 1930s and in the England of the early war years. There are various ways of atoning for deeds we regret, and in the book, writing becomes atonement. Briony Tallis, at 13 makes a mistake affecting two people close to her which haunts her for the rest of her long life. One of them is Robbie the son of the family's housekeeper, who has been given an Oxford education by the family, and the other is her older sister Cecilia who is in love with Robbie.Briony, who probably has a pubescent crush on Robbie, falsely accuses Robbie of sexual assault on Lola, a visiting cousin, and as a result Robbie is sent to prison. Five years later, in London during the early part of the Second World War, Briony tries to atone for her wrong. It is not at all clear whether Briony acted maliciously, but she feels guilty about it (it has destroyed her relationship with her sister) and that is sufficient.As the book gives alternative views of what has happened, the film makers have had to do the same, and have done so rather neatly, in a way which does not interrupt the narrative. This is easy in prose, but not so easy on film. They have also done a mini Spielberg re-creation of the evacuation of Dunkirk, which evokes the desperation of the event beautifully. Dunkirk was no triumph, merely a total disaster averted. The hospital scenes are grim testament to the losses the allies suffered. But this is a very personal story. Briony goes on to be a successful author, and it is only in the final scenes we find out how she has assuaged her sense of guilt. Here the film departs from the book, Briony (Venessa Redgrave) telling all in a TV interview rather than attending a birthday party put on for her by her family. The book somehow completes the cycle of Briony's life in a way the film does not.There is some staggeringly good acting here by all the actors playing Briony, Saiorse Ronan (who was only 12 at the time), Romola Garai, and last but not least Vanessa Redgrave. James McAvoy as Robbie and Keira Knightly as Cecilia also put in good performances though Keira's voice coach should be sacked  she was allowed to speak far too fast. The large ugly mansion used as the Tallis house, Stokesay Court in Shropshire, leaped straight from the pages of the novel, and the love scenes between Robbie and Cecilia were both tasteful and erotic.If we do have to have adaptations of highly literary works like this one, we can be thankful that here the spirit of the story is still present. I don't think McEwan writes with the screen in mind, though he wrote a brilliant screenplay for 'The Ploughman's Lunch' 25 years ago. He (and we) are lucky that the film makers here had some idea as to what he was on about.",9,0,1,6 January 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A Pleasant confection from the South
","A peculiar version from the Coen brothers of Homer's Odyssey, set in the depression-era Deep South of the US. George Clooney plays Ulysses Everett McGill , who escapes from a Mississippi chain gang with two not over-smart buddies, and encounters a blind seer and sirens, not to mention various other oddities on the way to reclaiming his wife Penny (Holly Hunter) and family. As with most road movies this is a fairly episodic production studded with vignettes, some better than others. The blind radio producer played by Stephen Root was one of the better ones with a manner reminiscent of W C Fields, and there is an entertaining encounter with 'Baby Face' Nelson, a notorious bank robber of the period, who, surprise, surprise, does not like to be called Baby Face.George Clooney, looking like Clark Gable, does a good job as Ulysses, a very handsome but not terribly bright man obsessed with the state of his hair. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Delmar, his even dumber sidekick.Good use is made of the Southern setting  you can practically feel the heat and smell the cotton fields and it's a road movie with plenty of road, so to speak. The whole thing is agreeably light and frothy and served up with plenty of bluegrass music. It's an interesting example of giving some old clichés a new twist  chain gangs, evil southern cops, gangsters, bent southern populist politicians, the Klu Klux Klan etc. A pleasant entertainment with some of Fargo's quirkiness without the blood and gore.",Null,0,0,10 June 2001
