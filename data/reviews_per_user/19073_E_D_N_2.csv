The New World," Superb. I recommend it... but with some reservations...
","... it's very much a TERRENCE MALICK movie, and by this, I mean, not the Malick of BADLANDS, but the Malick of DAYS OF HEAVEN and THE THIN RED LINE, i.e., Malick at his most naturalist and contemplative.THE THIN RED LINE esp., has much in common with THE NEW WORLD. We see the Natives inhabiting a sort of primeval earthly paradise, a place filled with joy and innocence but pregnant with foreboding: the inkling that somewhere, somehow soon, paradise will be lost.And lost it is.From the first glimpse of the sailing ships, the atmosphere of supreme beatitude that permeates the Native enclave is tarnished. Fear, curiosity, and ambivalance draw both settlers and Natives toward each other.Perhaps, some will fault Malick for depicting a Native world seemingly free of internecine conflict. It looks much too innocent and most inhabitants are too carefree. That some will shrug it off as yet another instance of 'noble savages' being by the evil white man is inevitable. I say to them, give Malick more credit. In my humble opinion, he proves to be even balanced in his depiction of both sides. There are a couple of caricature-ish soldiers among the newcomers, but on the whole, these are just a bunch of tired and hungry seafarers content to reach what they believe to be a safe haven -- no cartoonish, bloodthirsty white man.It's a strange and new experience for everyone and the first contact between them is surprisingly gentle, a process of mutual self-discovery -- that is, until the hostilities begin...Beauty applies to the film in many respects. The images and the colors are breathtaking. Malick more often than not uses a hand-held camera and shoots in tight compositions, close to the faces, in order to better grasp the expressions on the faces upon first contact.As could be expected, the gorgeous images of nature succeed themselves for most of the 150min running time, and that, apparently was a problem for many, as quite a few people walked out during the screening. I for one applaud Malick's approach and could not conceive of such movie without the contemplative shots. Wide commercial appeal seems limited, however.Anyways, I like that he uses spare dialogue with only minimal subtitles, to further emphasize the initial problems of communication.The battle sequences are swift and superbly edited for maximum impact. However, one thing I found strange is the lack of blood. I looked hard, but couldn't spot any blood flowing -- not very realistic given the otherwise VERY naturalistic approach.The problem with the script might be its lack of focus. There are three POVs throughout: SMITH's, POCAHONTAS's, and JOHN ROLFE's (each with V.O. narration) and though the story pretty much starts where one expects it, it does meander for stretches on end.As far as the acting is concerned: Kilcher is quite a find. She's perfect for the role. I've read some of the reviews by some critics who complained that she may not be the most 'trained' of actresses and I think it's an erroneous comment, for Pocahontas here is presented as the fleeting object of two men's desire and a elfin spirit of nature, fleeting through the tall grass, dreamy and the girl has such natural radiance that her standing there is enough. Her performance is organic, natural, perfect. She doesn't 'act', she is, and that's wonderful. She has a marvelous face and holds the camera and us, the audience in rapt attention.Colin is excellent as well. However, the role as written doesn't give him much leeway. He's basically in brooding mode and does it well, it's just that his character remains a bit of a cipher throughout. Still, he does make a solid SMITH even though I couldn't help thinking that maybe Christian BALE should have played the lead.BALE's JOHN ROLFE appears late in the movie, and it's to his credit that he completely eclipses FARRELL. It might just be that his character is better fleshed out and is easier to empathize with. In retrospect, the casting is good as it is, because I'm not sure FARRELL could have given such a sympathetic reading of ROLFE's character.I have been waiting for this movie since it was first announced that Malick would be at the helm and I'm not disappointed -- but then, I've been a Malick fan since BADLANDS. I recommend it to all, but many, I'm sure, won't like it.",9,12,27,11 December 2005
Rang De Basanti," RANG DE BASANTI  misguided AND a bad movie IMO.
","**** SPOILERS ***** Had read my share of decidedly mixed reviews, but nothing had prepared me for this.I was shocked, staring back at the screen in disbelief last night at my local multiplex.My quibbles: 1. THE SCRIPT - Too much going on, too many layers. Voice-over, one strand of the narrative set in the past, another set in the present. Somehow, all the different elements don't gel together all that well. Something that was obvious when Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekar Azad et al end up moving along to Khalbali blaring on the soundtrack.Events happen rather randomly in a disjointed kind of way and my jaw hit the floor when the following happened  for me, big WTF moments: - Aamir suddenly deciding that 'drastic measures have to be taken' and that to kill the politico would be the best thing to do, that, even though they had established that sensibilities had changed and that people -- young people esp. -- are no longer as politically engaged in as they were say 80-odd years ago.<ul><li>Even though it had been foreshadowed by having Karan's father coincidentally (and very conveniently) be involved with the Russian armament companies, Madhavan's death came off as a cheap plot device.</li></ul><ul><li>The killing actually takes place. WTF? - They hijack the radio station. The DJ makes the dramatic announcement about the killing and concludes with ' and now ROOBAROO!'  and the actual upbeat song plays on the soundtrack, clashing with all the dramatics that came before I was dying.</li></ul><ul><li>Karan killing his father  because 'it's the only way out'  again, WTF? - Ajay's mother slipping into a coma (!!!) and symbolically giving signs of life once the 'deed' is done  again, creaky plot mechanics IMO.</li></ul>Now, mind you, I'm not decrying the fact that they were yearning for change. I empathize, nay, I sympathize with and fully subscribe to revolutionary movements across the globe and their ideals, but here, I just felt that in the context of the film, the actions that follow Ajay's (Madhavan) death, were unwarranted and unnecessary, and that, surely, there could have been other ways, peaceful ways, to bring about change. As it is, it came off as the kind of empty-headed liberal ideology that gives conservative elements in governments around the world ammunition to dismiss such movements as 'hotheaded'.Maybe my above comments show how little I know about Indian politics and as one character says in the film, 'the corruption' rooted in it.Still, I had no sympathy for any of the characters, who quite frankly, came off as idiots IMHO. All they did was dance around and do nothing significant, with Aamir's character the most reprehensible of the lot, for he was the eldest and should have known better. Not holding down a job, living off his mother, and hanging out with his friends on campus. Was his character a 'model' to follow? I have my doubts about that. 'BE A REBEL' the soundtrack intones hhmmmm.The second half feels rushed, as if the screenwriter was going through the motions and trying to hit as many plot points as possible in the most mechanical fashion.2. ALICE'S CHARACTER Someone please explain what kind of documentary that was she was making? A reenactment of these revolutionaries' lives shot on the cheap with a DV camera? Sure looked sleek on screen what with the sepia cast, thousands of extras, etc LOL. Guess that budget of hers inflated as it went along And what kind of documentary was that anyway? Another problem is that when the film starts, SHE is the central figure in the plot. Midway through, her and the whole documentary storyline are discarded. Talk about consistency. Also, that AAMIR love interest subplot goes nowhere.My biggest problem though is WHY IS SHE  ANOTHER GORA  THE AGENT OF CHANGE? Why is it, that SHE, a white woman, is the one who rouses the Indians to consciousness about their life and their lack of engagement? That's what made me most angry actually. She, a foreigner, comes to India, and EDUCATES the local youths about their OWN history. How can people not be outraged by that? I found the idea insidious.Technically, the movie is okay.Acting-wise, everyone from ALICE PAYTON, to AAMIR, to SIDDARTH, to SOHA ALI KHAN (surprise!), etc are very good though I feel OM PURI was wasted in his small role.They should have done away with the songs. They just get in the way most of the time. Exception is the LUKA CHUPPI used to rousing effects during Ajay's funeral.The movie fails as an ode to youth, friendship, etc and at times I felt the filmmakers were trying to emulate some of the scenes and feelings one found in DIL CHAHTA HAI with the characters reveling in the lush fields and making the most of a time they know will never happen again misses the mark though and that second half almost erases all the good things in the first Very disappointing and off the mark!",5,13,35,12 February 2006
