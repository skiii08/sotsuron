Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing but you should at least see it!
","First off, I can say I was very excited for this movie. Me and my friends went on a bus trip after school to see it after months of waiting....and I was the only one who left disappointed. There are many flaws in this movie. First let's start with the acting. Jake Lloyd is tedious. He says some lines semi-correctly, but the others are way off and forced. You can tell he's trying, but it just won't cut it.I also have some gripes about Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor. Portman, a fine actress, is forced through most of the movie to speak monotonously. You almost fall asleep listening to her. As for McGregor, another fine actor, he was fine acting, but there was almost no point to his character being in the movie until the end.Darth Maul hardly has a part, contrary to what the commercials will have you think. His character is convincing however, but there is no buildup whatsoever to the final lightsaber battle between him, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon. Such a shame for such a great character.And now it's time for Jar Jar Binks. Without a doubt, he has to be the absolute most annoying character I have ever seen in a film. It's hard enough to understand what the heck he's saying, but worse is the way he's saying it. Was he really needed? It was obvious they were going to set records, so why go to the trouble of trying to appease kids by inserting this ridiculous, annoying THING. I could feel IQ points dripping away everytime his character was on the screen.The special effects, I have to admit, were fantastic. I usually look for good dramatics in movie, but they were so good that I have to admit I was sidetracked for awhile just gaping. The best scene in the movie is definitely the podrace, in which cameos are made by Jabba the Hut and the Sand People(Tuskens). It's exciting, exhilarating, and woke me up for 10 minutes.Another thing besides the acting that bothered me was the whole mood of the movie. It was too obvious that Lucas was trying to impress everyone he possibly could. The whole thing felt like a preview to Episode 1 rather than the actual thing.All in all, I don't think my money was wasted. I'm just nitpicking because I was so excited to see it and it just didn't live up to my expectations. It's no The Matrix, that's for sure, but it deserves admiration. So, if you haven't seen it yet, you not only belong to a very small club in the world, but you're missing out. So, despite all the flaws, go see it and relive your old experiences.",6,0,1,11 June 1999
Ed Wood," Overrated
","I can't believe the reviews I'm reading on here.  I'm seeing this film called 'brilliant' and 'touching' but personally, the best adjective I could use for it is 'decent'.  Like the recent Bowfinger, another movie about filming bad movies, this one gets so redundant you feel like you're getting hit over the head many times.  You keep on seeing the same scenes over and over and over again, and they lose their magic.And enough about Martin Landau!  If you read these reviews you would think he gave the best performance of the century.  He certainly did a great job, but please, how hard is it to imitate Bela Lugosi's accent and make a character you feel sympathy for?  That's pretty much all he did, but he did do it extraordinarily well, so I don't really object to his winning the Oscar.  Plus you can never forget the reason he made you think he was the real Bela Lugosi was the makeup..  As far as the other performances go, I thought they were all great.  Surprising coming from a review that has been so negative so far but I must give credit where credit is due.Another thing I liked about this movie was the cinematography.  Filming it in black-and-white was a great idea, and the film probably could have never worked without it.  It's got a nice little unique look going for it.I think the main reason I didn't like this film was the directing.  The aforementioned redundancy was a big problem, and I felt like this film could have easily been 30 minutes shorter.  Also, the film is presented in a manner that makes it get boring after awhile.  I think it could have been a lot funnier and more informative if they showed WHY the movies were so bad. You never really got to see that, except when it was blatantly(and quite humorously) showed in the octopus scene, which elicited a laugh from me. This film has a bit of an identity crisis.  It's not sure if it wants to be sympathetic to Wood, showing us the stupidity of his movies, letting us know what his friends were like, showing us how he actually got these movies made...it juggles through all and never really decides on one thing to focus on, making the film get muddled. So I give this movie a 5/10 because it disappointed me.  It could have been a lot better if it had another director, in my opinion.  The editing wasn't very good either.  Even though the script was redundant, there are a multitude of hilarious lines in it.  That's a wrap!",6,4,12,21 February 2000
Top Secret!," Good Movie Filled With Hard Laughs
","I first found out about this movie reading Roger Ebert's book of movie reviews.  He gave it ***1/2/4, and I could see why.  This movie is full of hard laughs, and the best thing about them is you have to look yourself to find them.  MY favorite is when someone is standing at an open window and they see a bunch of cars going down the streets and mice appear out of nowhere and go through the miniature cars.  Another great one involves Publisher Clearing House, but I won't ruin it.  All in all, this movie is worthwhile and deserves more recognition.  It's not as good as The Naked Gun,  but you should see it anyway.",9,0,1,29 June 1999
American Beauty," Enlightening Masterpiece
","American Beauty is the kind of film that will capture your attention and never relent, yet at the same time allowing you to discern what the message is for yourself.  I experienced so many different emotions during the course of the film that I can say with 100% certainty that this movie won't inspire numbness, the inability to feel anything and not feel yourself changing as the film unfolds itself.  Indeed, you'll be changed, but will the closing message really mean anything to you?The story, actually, is a rather simple one.  Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey), your average American Joe, has been 'dead' for a number of years.  His wife Carolyn(Annette Benning) orders him around, his daughter Jane(Thora Birch) is full of teenage angst, management at the workplace wants to fire him, and he sees no purpose or meaning in life.  To be blunt, he knows he doesn't matter in life and has an inability to do anything about it.  This all begins to change when he meets Jane's attractive friend Angela(Mena Suvari), as he is so overwhelmed by her beauty that he can't maintain control over himself, and he feels old sensations he had been blind to for so long.  She gives him a newfound mission and hence a new meaning for living life: He will win her heart and make love to her.  This inspires a direct rebellion of his life itself, and he vows never to be the same again.  Lester's metamorphosis during the rest of the film is very intriguing and fun to watch, as he finally is able to refute his selfish wife and become a 'winner'.  He proceeds to enjoy the splendors of life and ends up changing everyone else's as a result.  However, the message of the film does not come from Lester, but instead comes from new next door neighbor Ricky Fitz(Wes Bentley), a at-first-glance creepy 18-year old who is infamous for always carrying a video camera around with him.  When the viewer learns why he is always carrying this video camera, the main lesson of the film is taught, and enlightenment begins.  To say more about the plot of the film would be a crime, as it is best to experience it firsthand.It was no surprise to me that American Beauty won 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  It's uncanny that this is a directorial debut, from theatre expert Sam Mendes, and I'm anxiously anticipating his next work.  Every performance of the film is superb, with special recognition to Kevin Spacey and Thora Birch, the latter  being one who I could previously never imagine in a film like this after 'Hocus Pocus' and 'Monkey Trouble'.  What really is endearing about this film, however, is the message.  Life is truly beautiful, and as the film demonstrates it in subtle and non-subtle methods, you can feel the exact elation Lester Burnham feels as he is emancipated from his old boring life.  This truly makes this a masterpiece, as it is not so much about what goes on during the film but what you feel as you watch. The idea of this film, while seemingly not too different than Ordinary People and The Ice Storm, is a LOT different.  The Ice Storm was too cynical and existentialist, and Ordinary People was a bit in the same vein.  All three films expose the hypocrisy of modern American society, but only American Beauty leaves hope, and how truthful and God-inspired it feels.  This film is truly a masterpiece and one that every person should be privileged enough to see.  I recommend it with all of my heart, and I encourage anyone reading this to view it with an open mind, as it might seem a little wacky and hence distractful of the message if you're not careful.Rating: 10/10, a truly must-see film.",9,0,0,19 February 2001
Dark City," Excellent; One of the best films of the decade
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie.  I was expecting to see a dark tale about a bunch of aliens.  But wow...Alex Proyas has done such an astonishing job on this film it is hard to find a word good enough to describe it.  This film, besides being beautiful in shots, opens your mind up to new possibilities, and lets you leave the theater as a new person altogether. As far as the acting goes, it's excellent.  I kept on wondering where they found Rufus Sewell, and why he wasn't in any great movies prior to this. Also doing a surprisingly good job is Kiefer Sutherland, who continues to establish himself as a great, somewhat unknown actor.  I liked this movie so much, I even named my handle DarkCity.  If Alex Proyas continues such great work, he may be able to replace Stanley Kubrick as The King of Thinking Movies.",9,0,1,20 September 1998
American History X," Very Good Film
","One word comes to mind after seeing this film: potential.  This film could have been even greater than it was, but probably thanks to production squabbles, it wasn't.  The black-and-white sequences were superb and very well done.  In comparison, the present time sequences are poor but still well done.     Even though the acting in the film was excellent, a lot of things could have been done to make this film better.  I think the prison sequence could have been even longer, and I would have preferred if we saw just how changed Derek really was.  I also felt like I didn't really know Faruiza Balk's character very well, but this could be a good thing showing she was a one-dimensional idiot.        I was really impressed with the way they made Edward Norton look in his skinhead prime, he actually looked menacing and scary.  I also liked the directing style for some strange reason.  Someone pointed out before it seemed amateurish, but I disagree. This was a good, thought-provoking film.  It showed where racists get their beliefs and just how crazy something out of control can become.  It showed the horrors of hate crimes in a way other movies have failed to do in fear of being too frightening.  I gave this movie a 10/10, but I think it could have been even better if it had been a bit longer with a little more character development.",9,0,0,12 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Shakespeare in Love was better?
","I have no complaints of this movie, none at all.  As I'm sure you know, the film is about a group of soldiers on a search for Private James Ryan, a man whose three brothers have been killed.  The government wants them to save him because the mother will have lost all her sons if he dies.  There's not really much else I can say about the plot because the movie doesn't really have one.  Its whole purpose is to show what World War II soldiers went through, while throwing in a plot to keep the movie interesting. The war scenes are done very well, especially in the beginning and the end. They do a perfect job of showing the confusion and tragedy of war.  The directing is very good and Steven Spielberg definitely earned his Oscar for Best Director.  I have no idea how they made it look so real, and they managed to convey a real war atmosphere. One thing I noticed about this movie that only a few great movies have is the continuity and importance of each scene.  No scene seemed unimportant, and each one I watched with full attention.  There are never any unnecessary breaks and the movie as a whole has great continuity. Tom Hanks has always been one of my least favorite actors, because it seems like he plays the same character in all of his movies.  But in Saving Private Ryan, he did a great job and I saw no resemblance to any other of his characters.  One thing I also admired about him in this movie is that he never took attention away from any of the other actors.  Everybody seemed equally important. Overall, this movie was superb.  You should see it, it's practically your duty to.  I felt bad because I never took Memorial Day or Veterans Day too seriously, but now I know I will.  The least we can do is respect the soldiers who died for us and our country.",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
Donnie Brasco," A Meaningful Mobster Thriller
","'Donnie Brasco' is the true story of an FBI agent(Johnny Depp) whose job is to gradually infiltrate a lower, yet still quite dangerous, rung of the New York City mob in the 70s.  Masquerading around as 'Donnie Brasco, the Jeweler', he gets the attention of Lefty(Al Pacino), a veteran mobster who knows he'll never get ahead in the mob again, and subconsciously wants to mentor a mob foreigner to bring purpose back into his life.  Lefty is enamored with Donnie, and isn't afraid to 'vouch' for him to bring Donnie into his circle of the mob.  Soon Donnie becomes like another son to Lefty, and gradually gets to know his friends, including the ambitious Sonny Black(Michael Madsden).  Unfortunately his time on the job doesn't leave much for his wife Maggie(Ann Heche), who is tired of never having a husband around to support raising three children.  Furthermore, as he spends more and more time with Lefty's gang, Donnie proportionally loses his old identity and actually becomes 'Donnie Brasco'.  Saying more about the film would be time-consuming and wrong, since I only feel like I should give the basic meat of this very intriguing story and let anyone who hasn't seen it experience it for itself.The acting in this film is of the highest caliber.  Al Pacino, of course, gives an unbelievable performance as Lefty, able to elicit a lot of sympathy and empathy from the viewer despite the viewer's knowledge of his '26 hits'. It's clear that if his Lefty wasn't in the mob, he'd be your very admirable old next door neighbor, telling you stories and capturing your attention. From what I have read of reviews, people seem to be downplaying Johnny Depp's acting abilities.  I thought he did an amazing job, as the transformation from his real identity Joe to the cool Donnie Brasco is very visible and intriguing.  We know that he finds a lot more truth and meaning in the hectic and real mob life than in the impersonal bureaucratic FBI. When he says to his wife late in the film 'I can't breathe anymore', we know exactly what he means: Joe is almost faded away, and Donnie the Quintessential Gangster's lifestyle is his own.  Also not to be written off is Micheal Madsden, who also did a tremendous job in Reservoir Dogs.  Hey Micheal, why'd you waste your time with Free Willy and not take Quentin Tarantino up on his offer to play THE Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction???
A lot of people have written that this film forces a 70s vibe, but I don't think so at all.  Maybe I was too busy noticing Lefty's defeatist stare when he sees buddy Sonny shaking hands with 'The Boss' he so wanted to please- scenes like that made the film for me, and they're sprinkled throughout to create a very well-done picture.  It does have some flaws, however.  The family scenes could have been a lot better done, and I have the feeling that a lot more about the mob could have been explained.  Oh well, I can't even express how much value I got out of this film, as I got it for free from the library.  Please take the time to watch it- it's an excellent glimpse of the life I think we all sometimes desire to live, and also an exploration of the great loving relationship of Lefty and Donnie.Rating: Highly Recommended, 8.5/10",8,0,0,18 February 2001
Toy Story 2," Quite a treat
","I walked into this film with a bunch of little cousins expecting to see a good film that would probably be very predictable.  I was right about the predictability, but this film was amazing.  The computer animation was lifelike, the voices were great, I felt strongly for the characters, and I laughed many, many times.  This movie probably elicited the most laughs I've ever had in a movie theater, however this could just have been because the theater only contained me and my cousins.  I also felt glued to the screen and caught up in the story.  Anyways, I strongly recommend this film to anyone.  10/10",Null,0,1,14 February 2000
Psycho," Good, but not really Classic
","I'm not sure what to think about this movie.  I'm sure in 1960 it was amazing and the most overwhelming experience movie viewers ever had.  Now, it's too outdated to be suspenseful or scary.  How can this be called a perfect movie?  The acting isn't that good, first of all, and the performances feel forced.  The conversation between Norman and Marion wasn't really chilling, but hard to sit through. I have to admit I like the 'mother twist'.  Renting this movie about 8 months ago, I liked it better the night I watched it but have since changed my mind.  I didn't know that 'mother' was phony and was shocked at the surprise at the end, even though I knew Norman was the killer.Is this supposed to be evidence of Hitchcock's 'genius'?  The 'let's find Marion' subplot is really dumb, and there actually is no official plot. He just made it to try and scare people.  And what's with all the furor over the shower scene???  Now that isn't suspenseful at all. You probably think I'm someone who doesn't appreciate classics, but this is about the only one that doesn't cut it for me.  The true mark of a classic is the ability to have the same effect a long time in the future.  Citizen Kane does, this doesn't.  A good film to watch, but nothing like people make it out to be.",8,0,2,14 June 1999
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Great film!!!!
","I love this film!  The performances were great, with strong performances by Louise Fletcher, Jack Nicholson, and all of the inmates.  I really liked how the sequence of events all led up to the startling conclusion. <<SPOILER WARNING>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>When I first became acquainted with this film by reading a 15-page summary of it on Mr. Hollywood or some other film site like that, I cried when I read about Randall's lobotomy.  I was really troubled that someone with so much vigor and passion was turned into a passive vegetable by the establishment. Not only that, but the reactions of the patients in my mind as I read horrified me.  As far as the Chief's murder of Randall is concerned, I am against euthanasia actively and it bothered me very much but I respect that it was put into the film and novel.  The Chief saw it as something that had to be done before he made his escape. <<<<<<<<<<<<<END SPOILER WARNING>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Anyways, I really enjoyed this film and all the performances elicited strong emotions.  It deserved all the Oscars it received.",9,1,3,14 February 2000
Jaws," Spielberg's First........and Finest
","Actually, contrary to what people believe, this is not Spielberg's first film.  That honor officially belongs to Duel, his first silver screen movie about a truck trying to run over a guy. After just finishing a biography of Steven Spielberg by John Baxter, I found one of the most interesting things to be all the problems of shooting this film.  The shark, while not only looking terribly fake, also almost never worked in the water. For a fledgling director, this movie is remarkable.  It's got just about everything: action, suspense, good acting, and a great storyline, thanks to Peter Benchley.  I especially liked Robert Shaw as Quint, giving an almost flawless performance.  Richard Dreyfus does a good job as the young, rich Hooper and Roy Schreider plays the movie's protagonist and all-around good guy Chief Brody well. My favorite part of the movie is the first half, contrary to popular opinion.  It does a great job of setting the tone of Amity, and we can relate with the town's struggles.  The last half is great too, however, and some of the best action scenes ever filmed are in it. This is a movie you should really see.  I have no problems with it whatsoever, except it would have been nice to have more.  Bravo to Spielberg for pulling it off!",9,1,3,11 June 1999
