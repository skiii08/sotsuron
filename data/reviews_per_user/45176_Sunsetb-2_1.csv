Walk the Line," Excellent movie
",Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give amazing performances. I was very impressed with their singing and speaking voices. They are both very close to Johnny Cash and June Carter. The movie also captured the look and feel of the 1950's and the southern states where most of the music was performed.Very interesting bio. Learned a lot about Cash's motivation and the 'demons' that drove him to drugs and alcohol.I believe they both deserve an Oscar nomination but will be surprised if either receives an Oscar.Excellent movie. Best I've seen in 2005.,9,0,1,27 November 2005
