Ali," A great job by Mann and Smith
","Muhammad Ali himself had done a decent job reconstructing his carreer in 1977's The Greatest, yet a big Hollywood biopic was always on the cards and deservedly so.  Fortunately, Michael Mann was the right man for the job and has turned an inspiring, remarkable and thrilling story into an exciting, electrifying and entertaining film in sleek, reserved style.  Will Smith is the perfect choice to portray the great man and although the real Ali lingers in the mind throughout the film, Smith's performance is nevertheless winning and eye-catching.  The film span's Ali's career from his 1964 defeat of Sonny Liston (a great opening sequence) to his victory over George Foreman in the Rumble In The Jungle (a great climatic sequence).  In between, there's the brush over the Vietnam War and Ali's relationships with TV presenter Howard Corsell (Jon Voight) and boxing rival Joe Fraizer.  Oh, and the women.  A great job by Mann and Smith.",Null,0,0,8 August 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the great movies undoubtedly
","Raiders, the original, classic Indiana Jones adventure, is one of those films that when you revisit makes you realise how hardly anything so fresh, exciting and superb comes on our screens these days.  Following on from his only flop (1941), Steven Speilberg and George Lucas' all-stops homage to the old Saturday morning serials introduced us to the whip-cracking Dr Jones who would quite happily confront sword-windling Arabs and stowaway on a Nazi submarine but think twice about sharing a plane seat with a snake. 
In his first and greatest adventure, Indy (Harrison Ford) goes out in search of the Ark of Covenant when he is told that Hitler is out looking for the very same thing.  What follows is a non-stop array of spectacular action, death-defying thrills and ultimate tongue-in-cheek humour but its not all down to Speilberg's handling of the action that makes Raiders a classic among classics.  Ford is just as perfect and superb in the role as Connery was as Bond and the whole experience would not be the same without his thick sweat or ice-breaking smile.  Karen Allen also gives an endearing performance as the fiesty heroines whilst Paul Freeman and Ronald Lacey make terrific villains.  The film was an overwhelming success and Speilberg kept the magic perfectly in two equally successful and classical sequels.",10,0,0,17 July 2002
Billy Elliot," You'll gasp, laugh, cry and cheer
","British film got back on its feet over the previous twenty years with classic hits in all different shapes and styles. These were films like Gregory's Girl, Chariots Of Fire, Gandhi and more recently Brassed Off, The Full Monty and Little Voice. Now in 2000, there's Billy Elliot.  Critics especially have fallen for the film - the story of a boy's dream to pursue his hobby of ballet dancing during the 1984 miners strike.  The public of course have also been lured into Billy's adventure and few of them will leave the theatres, or in the future their televisions, without some expression or felling of awe and astonishment.We always welcome the 'underdog' story and that the films that use it rarely fail to strike a chord with cinemagoers.  And, the underdogs haven't always been adults, Billy Elliot isn't the first child on the big screen up against all the odds.  But what makes this film different has to be the passion and utter realism - what we're seeing really did happen - and somehow we fell drawn into Billy's effort to defy those undermine in his destiny and stand in his path.  It is a film which helps us in our fight in our own battles.It isn't purely a cinematic experience of course.  But if you wish to re-live the magic and spirit of all your favourite movies and in the way that you done them, pop along to the flickers for a proper cinema outing.",Null,0,0,8 October 2000
Dead Poets Society," Inspired
","1989 was one of them years where it seemed every Oscar-nominated picture deserved to scoop the prize.  Dead Poets Society missed out but that doesn't stop it from ranking as one of the best films of the Eighties.  Robin Williams shines in his finest film as Mr. Keating, an unconventional English teacher at a New England prep school who inspires and awakens his pupils - summed up with one famous catchphrase, 'seize the day'.  The film then focuses on the effect Keating's influence on a group of boys, with both successful and tragic consequences.  This could have easily been overly sentimental and clichÃ©-ridden but the script (which did win the Oscar) is believable, absorbing and observing, which successfully conveys the spirit and impact of the story.  All the important, crucial parts are perfectly cast and expertly performed by stars young and old.  An inspired film that will most certainly inspire whoever watches it.  And that's exactly what great films are all about.",Null,0,1,8 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A respectable and effective climax to a stunning series
","By the time of George Lucas' third installment of his Star Wars trilogy, the series had already surpassed itself through the previous two films leaving good old George a tough job in rounding off his landmark saga.  In terms of plot, originality and creativity, Jedi distinctly lacks in comparison with its predecessors and is more direct on resolving old questions and stories rather than taking any new paths.  The most inventive and diverting sequence in the film is its first half-hour in which our heroes attempt to save Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from Jabba the Hut, after which things regress into a notably routine formula.  However, in terms of thrills, tension and excitement Jedi still has considerably much to offer.  One of its merits is its handling of the relationship between the hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his villainous father, Darth Vader (David Prowse), which is captured perfectly in several scenes leading up to their penultimate duel.  A touching farewell from Yoda, a memorable forest shoot-out between the Ewoks and the Stormtroopers and a rousing, high-spirited finale, also help to make Jedi a respectable and effective climax to a stunning series.",Null,0,0,9 August 2002
Malcolm X," Electrifying!!!!
","MALCOLM X is an electrifying biography of the man played by Denzel Washington, who deserved 100% his Oscar nomination. The film is made on a spectacular scope, telling the remarkable story of a one-time Harlem criminal who converted to the Islamic faith and became one of the century's most remarkable revolutionaries Not to be missed!",8,2,7,28 November 1999
Spider-Man," An instant classic
","For once a film that lives up to the wait and hype surrounding it. Sam Raini's Spider-Man is an instant classic; a comic-strip screen adventure supreme that surpasses many of the recent blockbusters of recent years and ranks comfortably with the original Superman and Batman installments, as well as being a stunning film in its own right.Tobey Maguire is perfect as the young, nerdy student Peter Parker transformed by a spider-bite into the web-spinning, wall-climbing, wise-cracking superhero, whilst multi-millonare William Dafoe (in a splendidy villanous performance) risks loses his massive corporation, leaving him to adopt the evil persona of the Green Goblin.
This is fantastic stuff; good characters, spectacular action, strong themes, tounge-in-cheek humor, in-jokes - its all in there and used to the full. In terms of plot, the main focus is on Parker's complicated love for the girl-next-door (Kristen Dunst), which whilst somewhat unconventional for such an action film, brings a fresh, watchable and human touch to the proceedings.  Super fun - lets hope the inevitable sequel is just as good.",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
Rocky," Go the distance!
","The film that made Sylvester Stallone's an overnight sensation and launched one of the most successful film series ever.  However, this was much better than what would come later and other films of similar style have never matched its uplifting mood and edge-of-the-seat excitement. 
The endearingly old-fashioned story sees Stallone's uneducated, down-and-out, ghetto guy and part-time boxer called up to challenge the World Champion in a special Thanksgiving event.  The supporting cast is one of a kind. Talia Shire, Burgress Meredith, Burt Young, along with many others, all play roles that can be found down most streets whilist Carl Weathers wonderfully paints a picture of the ego that goes with fame and fortune as the Champ determined to give Rocky a hard time. The memories that viewers take home with them however continue to be director John G. Alividsen's training montage sequences, and of course, the final climatic fight.  All hallmarks from a hallmark movie.",Null,0,0,21 June 2001
Rocky III," It's the fell of the fight!
","Rocky III isn't better than the previous two.  The gritty realism and characterization is no longer with us and what we are given is something that's more comic-strip like and predictable. However, although it isn't brilliant, Rocky III stands out in a unique way.  You can't help to be lured into fantasy when 'The Eye Of The Tiger' begins to play over the opening titles as we get a glimpse of Rocky at his best - beating an array of challengers in triumph.  Rocky is a true champion.  Then, we have Clubber Lang.  He falls short to Apollo Creed in terms of humaness and conviction but nevertheless is a suitable draw-up for the film's story.  The boxing champion of the world finds his world close to ruins after the all-mean Clubber causes his manager to have a heart attack and then beats him for his precious title.  Actually, it's a common case.  The bad beat the good to steal something which is good.  However, the good don't usually fight back due to fear or the fact that this isn't possible.  But you can place a smile on your face because we're in the movies, we're in a Rocky picture. Although the specific plot in Rocky III isn't realistic we can to relate it by this way.  Rocky III helps us to enjoy ourselves while gathered around the television and also in confronting our demons.",Null,8,15,17 July 2000
It's a Wonderful Life," Everyone loves it!
","Everyone loves It's A Wonderful Life, if they don't then something's up. Very influental, this is a timeless classic from Frank Capra that doesn't seem to get as much screening on TV in the UK as it does in the USA. James Stewart is brilliant  and is without a doubt one of the all-time acting greats. Everyone else is great in a movie which is a true festive favourite.",10,1,4,22 December 1999
Jaws," Will never lose bite
","Following on from his success with Duel and Sugarland Express, Steven Speilberg took Peter Benchley's legendary bestseller and crafted one of the most effective thrillers in the history of the cinema.  Not to mention, one of the best and most popular films of all-time.For those who still may not yet be familar with the story, the action starts off at the picturesque island of Amity.  Cheif Brody (Roy Scheider ) is the new cheif of police and finds himself dealing with something that Amity has not encountered up till now - a shark attack.  His attempt to close the beaches is rejected by the mayor (Murray Hamilton) and it isn't long before another innocent beachgoer winds up as a victim. Brody calls out for the help of an oceanographer, Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss), and later the colourful shark fisherman, Quint (Robert Shaw). The three of them set out to sea in order to destroy the terror and it isn't long before they come face to face with a three-ton great-white shark.  The problem is though - who's the hunted here?Digtially remastered for its 25th Anniversary, Jaws has lost none of its stunning power or suspense.  Its a film that's guarnatted to frighten and fascinate viewers no matter times they've seen it or seen something familar. And once you remember and know by-heart the thrills and shocks, Speilberg's directorial genius becomes even more apparent.  The ensemble cast of Jaws is something else.  Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are an acting threesome made in heaven whilist those based at land, such as Hamilton and Lorraine Gary, and many other of the suffering locals stand out strongly.  To sum it up everything is awe-inspiring.  The cast, the shark, the script, the directing, the techniques, the music and everything else.  Jaws is a forever unrivalled cinematic masterpiece.",Null,1,3,16 September 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," A first class piece of film-making
","The prision movie is one of those rare genres where more or less every film turns out to be a winner (The Great Escape, Pappilon, Midnight Express), but The Shawshank Redemption of 1994 may well take its place as the best of them all.  Frank Darabont's hugely impressive picture cuts a remarkable balance in paying attention to the harsh realities brutalities of prison life whilst also successfully conveying the power and determination of the human spirit.  Tim Robbins is Andy DeFrans, a banker sent to the maximum security Shawshank prison for life for the alleged murder of his wife and lover, where he strikes up a friendship with the seasoned convict Red (Morgan Freeman).  The film has enjoyed huge popularity and acclaim since its surprisingly passive 1994 release (perhaps due to the attention surronding Forrest Gump) and almost certainly deserves its label as a contemporary classic; few films carry such a magnetic, absorbing and attentive pull.  The result is something that not only ranks as great entertainment but a chance for the viewer themselves to enjoy and appreciate a first-class piece of screenwriting and film-making.",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
Ben-Hur," One of the greatest movies ever made
","BEN-HUR of 1959 with Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, is one of the greatest movies ever made. There are few films which truly rival it's spectacle and spirit. As well as being one of the best movies ever, it also contains two classic cinema scenes; the slave gallery and the chariot scene. Heston (the title character) and Boyd (as his poisoned, one-time friend) are outstanding in one of cinema's legends.",10,0,3,28 November 1999
Rear Window," A fautless exercise in suspense
","Stewart and Kelly are excellent in Hitchcock's complusively watchable classic that's stylishly shot and is a fautless exercise in suspense. The master is at his best, building up the tension and yet mixing it with reassuring humor which provides the audience with relief from the suspense. This is definatly a Hitch all-time great and one of the best films from the 1950's.",Null,0,2,31 December 1999
Gladiator," The cinematic highlight of 2000
","In Gladiator, Ridley Scott has most probably fashioned devised the cinematic highlight of the year and revived the beloved genre of Biblical/Roman epics in hi-tech, '90's style.  However, there is no Biblical references in this one and it is much darker than the classics (in particularly Spartacus) which it has been moulded around.  Like those films it is truly spectacular (special effects are at their best when you can hardly notice them) and has perfect actors playing memorable actors.  There are some truly touching scenes (especially the last one) and others are fast, furious and blood-wrenched. All in all, Gladiator is a hugely impressive film which brings an old genre back to life and gives it an added dimension.  It will probably spawn a few imitators but this original will end up a classic.",8,0,0,13 May 2000
