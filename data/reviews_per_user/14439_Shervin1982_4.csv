Scarface," The story of a Cuban immigrant from his immigration as a dish washer to his success as a hot shot drug dealer
","Hats off, one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Once again Pacino proves his acting ability playing the role of Tony Montana, a low class, drug dealer. The funniest thing is that he didn't even receive an academy award nomination for Scarface. Scarface is definitely one of the greatest films of all time, so if you haven't seen it, try it. You won't regret it.",Null,0,1,7 November 2002
The Godfather: Part III," An old family head faces the question to let a family member of his marry his daughter who wants to become the head of the family.
","Godfather Part III is the turning point of michael corleone's life, as he faces the question to go on with his sins and brutality of his family or to choose the next head as he goes down on retirement. The theme of this movie's changed a lot since part II, in which Corleone family was a powerful mob family. Here the Corleone family's been shown as the absolute power and dominating force. The culminating is quite sad which with the enormous play of Al Pacino becomes one of the best emotional scenes in the history of Cinema.",10,0,2,2 November 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Neo has to choose!
","I wouldn't call it a movie, rather a sequence of actions. If you're looking forward to watching fight scenes for over an hour, this is a must see. But the movie as a whole, is very poor and aimless. Martix reloaded compare to its prequal is very disappointing.",4,0,0,16 May 2003
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is fascinating.
","One of the best films made by Scorsese. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a solid performance (one of the best I've seen in years) and ofcourse the direction. What I love about Scorsese is the fact that he makes violence look frightening and that's really how it is, unlike in movies like James Bond series, or XXX that make the audience think of it as funny(cool) scenes, which it really is not. Violence is horrible and that's how it should be pictured, unlike some would say. The movie's powerful scenes performed by Day-Lewis are startling, dazzling and stunning, which at one point was so realistically shocking that stunned me transfixed on the seat for minutes. Certainly an oscar worthy picture.",10,1,1,17 January 2003
