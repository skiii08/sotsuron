Black Swan," A intense, infuriating masterpiece
","I just got back from the cinema and I felt compelled to write a review of Black Swan. I researched it extensively before going and I found an array of different reviews and it seemed that nobody was quite sure what to make of it. So, I went to see it with mixed expectations, not really sure what it was about and whether I would like a Film about a Ballet. Right from the get go, I was in no doubt that this was an Aronofsky film as it is exceptionally dark and menacing.Natalie Portman was outstanding, I would certainly say a career best. I could see all through the Film the dedication and commitment that she gave to play this role. She really captures the brooding intensity and paranoia that this role required. Cassel is the character that you expect him to be and I think he was perfect for the role. Mila Kunis was good, however, I felt that she had limited screen time and as such I can understand her being overlooked for Awards.This Film is definitely not for everyone, If you are looking for a ballerina film or a mindless 2 hours then stay away as you will not enjoy this. This film is dark, brooding, often infuriating and quite scary. It is a trip into the dark mind of a Woman who so desperately wants to be perfect.I felt that at times the Film didn't know what it wanted to be, it delved into the genres of drama, thriller and downright horror. It felt like the director didn't want to dwell on the ballerina aspect and as such appeal to a greater audience. However, all this aside, I would recommend this Film as it is visually breathtaking, an emotional masterpiece and a thrill ride into the subconscious with the audience never really sure whats real and whats not.",8,1,3,27 January 2011
