3:10 to Yuma," Flawed, Stritctly for Adults, But Worth Seeing
","This is a splashy, color remake of a movie made in 1957 in black and white. There is much added material, much more blood and violence, lots more talking. An element of sadism along with occasional four letter profanity make this movie UNSUITABLE for viewers of tender age.The production values are high, with full exploitation of fifty years of advances in movie-making. The gunfire sounds startlingly real. The roughness of frontier towns like Contention, Arizona is convincingly depicted--half the buildings are just tents, muddy streets, few women to be seen. The director understood the importance of the role of Ben Wade's lieutenant--played in the original by the young and fair haired Richard Jaeckel. The casting was right on the money here, with this time the character's feminine element explicitly pointed out rather than implied. A big surprise was the gritty performance by Peter Fonda--unrecognizable but utterly believable as a tough-as-leather Pinkerton man and a long way from 'Easy Rider'. Just as that film launched a second career for Jack Nicholson, Fonda could benefit much from his work in this one. Plausibility problems begin with the first scene: the holdup of an armored wagon. Five of the twenty men in Wade's gang are killed. Would you join an outfit with a loss rate of 25 percent? The other plot holes have been thoroughly exposed in earlier reviews. Amazing how ignorant these experienced lawmen are about prisoner transport! The last scene is both repulsive and ridiculous, truly an anticlimax. An entertaining two hours all the same.",8,2,4,3 October 2007
G.I. Jane," 'The Value of a Woman's Life?'
","A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background, contained the comment 'A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's'.This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population, sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia.No society, however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier.'G.I. Jane' is Hollywood fluff.",4,11,24,29 November 2007
Black Book," May I Recommend...
","The boobs of Clarice van Houten aren't all that attractive, though she shows them at the slightest provocation. (The nipples are small, like a man's.) Everything else wrong with this preposterous picaresque has been fully described in other comments, often awkwardly in English but sometimes quite eloquently. At the beginning, it is said to be 'inspired by actual events'--a slippery, essentially meaningless statement. Certainly **Zwartboek** does not depict any actual events!If you are looking for a serious treatment of the moral dilemmas of war, occupation, resistance and collaboration, rent a copy of 'The Counterfeit Traitor' (1960) starring William Holden and Lili Palmer. That is a movie for grownups. It has a fine, international cast and genuine European backgrounds. The characters and events ring true.But go not near this big budget piece of garbage.",3,6,18,15 March 2008
Coriolanus," Superb in Every Way
","When bringing before the public a play that is exactly 400 years old, originality is an important aspect to success. Moving the setting from the Roman Republic of 500 B.C. to present-day England-- though it still is called 'Rome'--and depicting infantry combat in a built-up area using contemporary weapons and battle dress with frightening realism, this picture presents a little-known Shakespeare play in a novel way. The producers had the good sense not to alter the language. Though drastically pared down--a twelve line speech often reduced to one--it is Shakespeare as the Bard wrote it.The themes of the play are universal, transcending time: the fickleness of the mob, the jealousy and treachery of politicians, the mutual respect of men in the profession of arms even when they are adversaries, the conflicting pull of family loyalty.There isn't a bad performance anywhere. Vanessa Redgrave in a series of masculine outfits has aged superbly and gives a bravura performance as the protagonist's mother. Ralph Fiennes, head shaved and scars on his face, makes a convincingly patrician Caius Martius, brave in war but unable to navigate the tricky currents of politics or win the love of the common people. He's also got that Shakespearian essential: a great voice. Tall, rugged Scotsman Gerard Butler is completely convincing as his formidable enemy-- and some time comrade--the ruthless Aufidius. The supporting roles are also very competently acted with some unusual casting of a black South African as Martius' military superior and a woman as First Citizen, the voice of the plebeian class in the early Roman Republic.But the highest tribute must go to Fiennes' astonishing competence as director. Battle scenes, interior scenes, crowd scenes, all are handled with the skill of a veteran cineaste such that the movie never drags, never slackens in pace from the opening food riot by the plebs which seems ripped from the headlines to the tragic and inevitable end.",9,5,7,5 June 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," Like the commenter from Harbin said: 'Good Movie, Bad Message'.
","Several messages, actually, all of them bad.As an old-line Marxist, director Lumet is a stalwart partisan of the working class-- theoretically. Yet Bath Beach in Brooklyn, NY, an actual working class neighborhood where the movie is set, is depicted as a disorderly community of layabouts and hooligans, solidly on the side of the bank robbers, who try to keep the police from doing their job.Perhaps it is because Bath Beach is a **white** neighborhood that it is so negatively depicted by the politically correct.Not that Lumet is any friend of the forces of order, either. If the thoroughly anti-police 'Serpico' and 'The Anderson Tapes' didn't make this director's views clear enough, note here how the F.B.I. agents are shown as treacherous, evil men because they quickly and professionally bring to an end a dangerous situation which the local police struggled with for ten hours without a resolution. Maybe Hollywood wasn't trying to sneak in some pro-gay propaganda, but Sid Lumet certainly was. The character Sonny, sympathetically played by Lumet regular Al Pacino, neither acts nor sounds homosexual. You do not have a clue that he is gay until a good half way in the movie when the motive for the bank robbery is revealed. This subtle bias takes up the theme begun in the earlier 'Anderson Tapes', where a prior physical relationship between the Sean Connery hero and a very young Christopher Walken is suggested.Made in the mid seventies, this picture embodies the sixties in its alienated social attitudes. See how Lumet has the all white crowd absurdly shouting 'Attica! Attica!' to show his own sympathy for the rioting convicts at that upstate prison whose murdering of every white person they could reach, guards and fellow inmates, was ended only by police gunfire.",5,5,20,10 July 2008
