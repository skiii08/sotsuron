Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The downside of free speech
","I am amazed that anyone with any understanding of film or good writing could rate this film as a 10 (the most common rating!). It's obviously a groundbreaking film but not in any positive way. It got cheep laughs by tricking real people into embarrassing situations and didn't show any real film-making skill.The film always chose to get the easy laugh rather than try to say something meaningful or help the viewer to see the world from the perspective of another person. It was pure exploitation and its unfortunate that others will try to copy its formula before we all get sick of this kind of film-making. Comedy can be a powerful tool for good, but this film probably left most people feeling guilty they contributed to its huge economic success and probably assured a sequel.We would only see a film like this in a free speech world, but it takes the right to make a movie like this as more important than the value of a movie like this. Sasha should be ashamed of himself for creating a film that so clearly is based on hate of every culture including his own. Its easy to make a film that makes people look stupid, its much harder to show that other perspectives are valuable. I hope Sasha will take some of his dirty money and spend it to repay some of the people he has hurt.",1,181,358,23 November 2006
