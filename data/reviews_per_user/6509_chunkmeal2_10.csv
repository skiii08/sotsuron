Iron Man 3," Extremely sad
","Iron Man = Very awesome Iron Man 2 = Slightly less awesome but still very damn good. The Avengers = Officially one of my top 10 favorite movies ever.Iron Man 3 = WTF??? It was like some bad James Bond movie from the 1970's. Random bad guys doing random bad things. Room service comes to hotel room and out pops the bad guy just behind room service. Girl in bra gets tied up and waits to get rescued. President of da USA gets involved. Bad guys hijack good guys' equipment. Lots of random explosions. No explanation of how the bad guys can mysteriously take over all the TV channels in the USA. No explanation of how the bad guys have this super magic super powers, that allow them rip Iron Man to bits or melt down Iron Man, even though Iron Man has previously had no trouble taking down an invasion of aliens swarming into Earth through a wormhole. Etc. Etc.Random lame jokes where Iron Man gets hit by a trailer and breaks into bits. Mark 42 comes flying in to the rescue and trips over something and falls into bits. Haha. Why not have Iron Man slipping over a banana peel?The anxiety thing was I guess a modern (or 'postmodern' touch), but made ZERO sense. It didn't fit in at all and just seemed like a random monkey wrench thrown in to spice things up.The plot, writing, and dialog were just total crap. This was easily the worst movie of the 7 movies released in the Marvel cinematic universe to date.After Iron Man 1 and 2 and the Avengers, I was starting to fall in love with Robert Downey Jr. He was still an amazing actor in Iron Man 3, but with such crappy writing and dialog I don't know how he was even willing to be in this movie. (Well probably helps that they paid him a little.)",4,1,5,6 September 2013
Gone Baby Gone," I'd like this movie more if it was more believable
","Haven't read it, but probably the book was better. So much moral complexity and layer upon layer of conspiracies cannot be done in 110 minutes, especially when it's an often deliberate, dramatic 110 minutes.55 minutes into the movie (halfway mark), kidnapped girl is supposedly drowned. Body is never found. We know that obviously there is something more to this; and we're willing to bet that she is still alive, since this movie is obviously nowhere near done. We just don't know where this could possibly be headed.Another 20-25 minutes pass and we discover that girl's uncle and Ed Harris have something to do with it. Seems they did it for the money. Hrm OK sure, a bit of a stretch, especially since the movie is ending soon. Then bam! 10 minutes later, we're slammed with the jaw dropping revelation that ex police chief Morgan Freeman had something to do with it. About 5 more minutes before everything is clarified to us. Apparently uncle, Ed Harris, and Morgan Freeman were good guys trying to do the good thing and had set up this *massive* conspiracy to rescue this particular little girl from her mother. Then just another 10-15 minutes to mull it over and the movie ends.Altogether this movie was very well done, but the *massive* conspiracy at the end was just too much of a stretch. If it's not a superhero or fantasy movie, you need to have at least a little bit of plausibility. Couple of cops in Boston manufacturing a gigantic, insanely complicated conspiracy to save a girl from her crack-addicted mother? When (i) there is great uncertainty about how the girl will turn out (probably the majority of kids whose parents are crack addicts turn out fine); (ii) there are, besides kidnapping a girl and manufacturing a conspiracy, a quadrillion other options to making sure the daughter of a crack addict turns out OK--(a) call Social Services, as boy detective suggested; (b) offer to adopt the kid from the mom; (c) offer to take care of the kid at least occasionally if the mom doesn't want to give her up; (d) keep a vigilant eye on the kid at all times (e) etc etc etc.",8,0,2,23 September 2013
Incendies," Best. Twist. Ending. Ever.
","Woohoo! Turns out their brother is also their father! Best twist ending ever!Uh, actually, no.I sat through the first 1.5 hours of this movie, hoping that there'd be some redeeming quality at the end, other than the usual arty farty French (or French Canadian) BS. Wow turns out it's not quite what you expected.For a more authentic and heartwrenching Canadian performance depicting horror and grue, go see instead 'One Lunatic One Icepick' (warning: parental advisory). It's only about 10 minutes long, compared to 2 hours of this Incendies nonsense.P.S. I sat through the movie thinking how absolutely shitty the twin brother's acting was (the others were OK, but nothing stellar), so my mind was blown when I read Rotten Tomatoes' summary which called the acting 'impressive'.",5,9,23,22 March 2013
American Beauty," My all time greatest movie (or favorite or best, however you want to put it)
","I do not understand why American Beauty is not regarded by more as the greatest/favoritest/bestest movie ever.The first time I ever watched it, after the dénouement, and as the Beatles' 'Because' played at the end credits, I just sat there spellbound and transfixed, thinking, 'WTF just happened??'A roommate of mine passed by the living room (where I was watching the movie) and asked, 'Oh was it good? Was it deep? Was it intelligent?' I must have just mumbled something in response. But what I was thinking afterwards was that you can't just characterize this movie as 'deep' or 'intelligent'. This is one of the very rare precious gems that may be correctly described as ineffable. This ineffability is all the more so, given the totally mundane and unexciting premise of a suburban family, consisting of a 40 something year old father in some sort of a midlife crisis, an unhappy wife/property agent, and an angsty teenage daughter. The only way to do justice to this movie is to tell you to go watch it, if for some really odd reason you haven't already!",10,0,1,26 March 2013
Call Me by Your Name," Utterly predictable and unconvincing
","I had heard absolutely nothing about this movie, but downloaded it (legally of course) and watched it only because it was on the list of Best Picture nominees.The first one hour or so was utterly boring with nothing going on. An intellectual, multiglot family chills out in the summer at some villa in beautiful Italy. Some grad student Oliver comes to 'work'.I could not see at all where this movie was going. Which meant, of course, that there was only one utterly predictable possibility - the 17-year-old son Elio was going to have some sort of love affair with the grad student.But this possibility made no sense to me. There was no chemistry/romance between the two of them and not the slightest hint that either was attracted to more than just members of the opposite sex.Then boom, midway in the movie, they suddenly start hooking up. You see it coming only because that's the only way the movie could possibly have gone (to have any hope of redemption), yet it was utterly unconvincing. They then spend the rest of the movie frolicking and having more unconvincing hook-ups.I will admit that Elio's performance was pretty good and thus worthy of a Oscar nomination (but certainly nowhere near as good as Gary Oldman's Churchill). But Oliver's performance was especially unconvincing and wooden. It was possible that Oliver was engaging in a manipulative, one-sided fling with a kid, but completely unbelievable that he was madly in love with Elio, as we were made to believe towards the end of the movie with the 'epic' father spiel and the phone call.",4,5,16,12 May 2018
Lincoln," Felt like a propaganda reel extolling the virtues of American democracy
","Altogether this was a decent movie. I can see why Americans who've been taught all about the Civil War and how wonderful and great Lincoln was might thoroughly enjoy this movie.But for the remaining 7 billion of us on this planet this was a bit of a yawn. While getting a constitutional amendment to pass is exciting fare in the US, those of us who have not already been thoroughly suffused with this aspect of American history are, like, whatever.Too slow paced. For example, for a 2.5 hour movie it could've shown us a bit more of the Civil War to spice things up (rather than just some burning buildings and corpses strewn about). I guess Spielberg and producers wanted this to be exclusively a hagiography about Lincoln, but I'm sure there are already lots of American high school history textbooks for that. C'mon! Give us some explosions and gun battles and boom-boom-pow!And finally, for the 7 billion of us who don't think the US is the greatest country on the planet, a lot of the movie felt like a cheesy propaganda reel.",7,0,4,14 September 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Run-of-the-mill superhero movie - a disappointing and unworthy sequel to The Avengers (2012)
","In my opinion, The Avengers (2012) was one of the best movies ever. If you disagree with me, you are an idiot.I watched The Avengers (2012) while on a plane and deeply regretted not watching it in a cinema instead, because it was so focking awesome. After landing, I got a digital copy of it (through entirely legal means of course) and watched it about 10 times within a two- week span. I ALSO proceeded to watch ALL the previous MCU movies, none of which came close to being as awesome as The Avengers, although some (such as the very first Iron Man) were very damn good.I vowed that I would pay to watch ALL sequels to The Avengers in a proper cinema. I also forecast that the series of Avengers movies would be the best/greatest/awesomest trilogy (or quadrilogy) of all time.So imagine my disappointment when, three years later (i.e. today), I had to sit through 2+ hours of an utterly pedestrian superhero movie. I felt like crying when, after random things blew up and rocks flew around and they went to 'The New Avengers Facility', I realized the movie was coming to an end. Because you deeply value my opinion, here are my rankings for the 11 MCU movies released so far (as of May/June 2015):#1 Avengers 1 A++ One of the best movies ever #2 Iron Man A+ #3 Captain America 2 A #4 Guardians of the Galaxy A #5 Iron Man 2 A (unlike most, I actually liked this) #6 Thor 2 A-#7-#10 B+ (Run-of-the-mill, predictable superhero movies) The Incredible Hulk Thor 1 Captain America 1 Avengers 2#11 Iron Man 3 B- Total Scheiβe (compared to most of the other MCU movies). I hated this particularly bad.",7,2,6,2 June 2015
3 Idiots," Too long; gets much better towards the end; ripe for a Hollywood remake
","A wonderful and uplifting if at times cheesy movie. This is quite possibly the first Bollywood film I've ever watched ---I am glad to have done so.Suggestions:This would have been a much better film had it been say 1 hr 50m instead of 2hr 50m in length. Cut back on some of the school and antics stuff. (But perhaps a lengthier film is standard in Bollywood? I do not know.) The 10 years later stuff especially was good and should have taken up half the film rather than just one third.All the suicides and suicide attempts were a bit too melodramatic and unbelievable. It'd be fine if it were really a reasonably accurate portrayal of school life in India---suppose say the average person attending one of these top schools is likely to be acquainted with at least one person who has attempted suicide primarily because of such matters. But I doubt there is anywhere in the world---even in India, China, Japan, Korea---where things get that extreme.",8,0,1,1 February 2015
The Wolverine," WORST X-men movie ever (by far).
","Usually plot holes are isolated. This movie was however one giant plothole. (1) GrandpaThis is what I understood at the end of the movie: Turns out Grandpa is a bad ass who just wanted to magically suck Wolverine's healing powers and live forever. So what he did was (i) Invite Wolverine to Japan; (ii) Fake his own death; (iii) As part of his plan (?) inject a spider onto Wolverine's heart so that he loses his healing powers--What in the world did this achieve for evil Grandpa?; (iv) As part of his plan (?) allow his granddaughter to be subject to multiple assassination attempts, just so that Wolverine will keep following her; (v) Then after leaving a trail of crumbs for Hansel and Gretel, captures his granddaughter, and lures Wolverine to some sort of lair, where his powers can be sucked.The (?)'s indicate where I am not sure if it was really part of Grandpa's plan or things just worked out this way. Given the tremendous amount of uncertainty involved in the above plan (e.g. Wolverine might've been killed, in which case no powers to suck; his granddaughter might've been killed, in which case end of story, and Wolverine would've returned to the Yukon to chill out with grizzlies), you'd think there'd been a simpler and cleaner way to do all this. But no. All this is quite forgivable, compared to other things that went wrong. (2) ViperwomanWhat the hell is motivating her? What does she want? Is she working for herself? Or is she working for Grandpa and if so, why? How did she inject the spider onto Wolverine's heart? Just by kissing him in the middle of the night? (This was never clarified.)(3) Japanese Father and Japanese FiancéOK so it turns out the whole family (except pretty granddaughter) are a bunch of one-dimensional assholes. This is clichéd and boring and stupid, but still acceptable if you at least make some effort explaining what exactly was motivating them. Japanese Father wants to kill his own daughter just because Grandpa willed her everything? (Oh, and this too was part of Grandpa's grand masterplan?)Japanese Fiancé is just some asshole who's engaged to pretty granddaughter (this, BTW, is explained for us gaijin simply by the line that 'You're not Japanese, so you won't understand'). He's the minister of justice or something. And he likes to have white hookers in his hotel room. Uh, and what else do we know about him? Nothing! Basically he's just some asshole who somehow wants to do bad things. There are many other things wrong with this movie. E.g.,(4) Totally artificial and forced chemistry between Wolverine and pretty Japanese granddaughter.I literally cringed whenever they hooked up. (5) Jean Gray bad dreams BS was just LAMEI can think of only two things I liked about the movie: (A) The Nagasaki A-bomb scene. Pretty sick, think it's the first time I've seen it portrayed up-close in any movie. (B) The black ninjas, doing their thing in the middle of the night and flying across roof-tops.Other than that this movie was total scheisse.",3,480,688,27 July 2013
Looper," The last part especially sucked
","You thought they were going to help string things together and make sense of everything. Instead you just get a parting shot of the boy and I guess we're supposed to ponder deeply about what actually happens. Ooh. Profound. Turns out that rude little farm-boy is the American version of Akira (google it - many here have already mentioned the Terminator rip-off, but I didn't notice anyone mentioning Akira.)Totally random and unrelated. Hey why not just have the Avengers pop out of nowhere to save the day? Lots have also mentioned the incoherence and problems with time-travel. My only comment will be this: It was a cheap trick to try to get away with it by having Bruce Willis saying 'It's complicated.'I am reminded of how my elementary school teacher used to tell us that we should never end stories with 'It was all just a dream.' It's stupid, anti-climactic, and cheap (well I think she put it in a nicer way, but that was basically the message). Same thing with this movie, especially the last half hour. Altogether there were some entertaining moments, which is why I'd still give this movie a 7. I don't regret spending about two hours of my life watching it, but it's close.",7,0,1,24 June 2013
