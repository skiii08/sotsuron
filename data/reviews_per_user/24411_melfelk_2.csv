The Ring," If you are looking for a good scare...ignore this movie
","This movie should have ended about 15 minutes before it actually did. Then I'd be able to say it was a decent attempt at a horror movie. But the way it is, it sucked. I understood it all, and granted it had a good concept, but scary? No...not at all. Not nearly as scary as people made it out to be. The acting was horrible. I will give props to the first death scene though with Amber Tamblyn. The beginning of the movie made me think I would like it, but the farther it went, the more I disliked it. If you are a mediocore horror movie fan, see it, and be scared. But if you like your horror movies scary, then I would pass on it.",Null,0,0,1 February 2003
Final Destination 2," Not for the weak stomach...
","While this movie isn't Oscar caliber, and was never expected to be, it's still a fun movie to watch. Gruesomely gorey. If you have a weak stomach, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you can stomach it, that only makes it all that much better (people were actually throwing up in the theater and leaving during the death scenes). Much better than it's predecessor.",6,0,0,31 January 2003
