The Ring," Goosebumps all the way.
","This movie was GREAT! Just what i was looking for.All you picky people who think youre so perfect:The blurry faces in the pictures, was just a sign that the person had seen the film. Even just that was kinda creepy in itself.I give it a 10 out of 10! Seriously..i mean it!Lord of the rings is nothing of an experience compared to this movie.",10,0,0,31 December 2002
