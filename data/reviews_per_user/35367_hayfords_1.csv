Ford v Ferrari," Almost perfect motor racing film
","The US title is closer to the film. It's not really Le Mans 66. The story and its telling is brilliant. As someone who has been to Le Mans and used to race cars, I can say that it doesn't convey the atmosphere or the general background noise. The pits in the film are authentic down to the dark concrete corridor at the back. The new pits are nothing like the older pits. As a story it is superb, but lacks what is needed to make a fantastic motor racing film.",9,1,3,19 November 2019
