Walk the Line," Haven't I seen this before?
","This is one of those films that is very good at fooling people into thinking it's brilliant. Yes, it has its moments, like when the on-stage chemistry of Phoenix and Witherspoon is at its most evident, but on the whole, there's just not much to it. It follows the rise-fall-rise format of just about every other biopic out there. (Johnny makes it big and is surprised and happy. Johnny gets too big for his britches and develops a drug problem. Johnny meets the girl who can bring him down to earth and give his life meaning again.) I was certain this movie had nothing new to offer when Cash went through the addiction withdrawal scene (shaking and grimacing in bed) that has become almost obligatory in this kind of movie. And the pacing! Oh, the pacing! This movie drags itself along like a two-legged dog. This is one of those films where the editor could have had a field day, and should have, but for whatever reason, didn't.That said, what the movie lacks in direction and writing is almost made up by the outstanding performances. Phoenix and Witherspoon are obviously perfect for their roles and they do spectacular things with the material given them. In parts, Phoenix's singing voice is almost indistinguishable from Cash's. Witherspoon's is noticeably different than June Carter's, (lacking a bit of the country twang) but is still just a beautiful voice to listen to. And I was really blown away by the strength and vulnerable elegance she put into her performance.The magnificent performances and the wonderful music save the movie, but the script is so predictable (even for a biopic) and the direction so lackluster (although there are a few very pretty shots) that you may get the feeling you're wasting your time. Or, as in my case, that you've seen this all before.",6,0,2,9 July 2006
