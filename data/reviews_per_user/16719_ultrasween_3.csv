"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," The Adventures of Pricilla, Queen of the Desert
","The Adventures of Pricilla, Queen of the Desert is a wonderful story highlighted with stunning cinematography, excellent costume design and outstanding performances. The story is concerned with three drag-queens who get a gig in the middle of the Australian desert. Through these characters the film touches on subjects of alienation, found and forgotten love, friendship and hardship. Mostly set on their road trip through the desert, they travel in a lavender bus, which over the course of the film is subjected to hate crimes and breakdowns; becoming a symbol for its femme-masculine inhabitants and what they have endured. The Adventures... is truly original and entertaining from its highs to its well executed dramatic lows. S",8,0,1,19 June 2018
American Psycho," American Psycho
","Bret Easton Ellis' haunting and controversial 1991 novel about a psychotic business executive who specializes in 'Murders and Executions' is brought to life with some trimming here and there, most likely to avert a high rating and to not displease viewers with uncut visual depictions of the already graphic novel. Christian Bale gives a stellar performance as the maniacal Patrick Bateman which absorbs the viewer into his world of delusions, stained sheets and prostitutes. The supporting cast is great as they reflect upon Bateman's ever crumbling fa√ßade. S",8,1,1,19 June 2018
Django Unchained," Django Unchained
","In Django Unchained writer/director Tarantino tends to impress then fail miserably throughout the film. The storyline concerns a German bounty hunter (Waltz) who frees a slave (Foxx) with the intention of using him to track down The Brittle Brothers. Waltz then proceeds to help Foxx rescue his wife from a ruthless plantation owner (DiCaprio). It is blatantly unfortunate to see how important Sally Menke, Tarantino's deceased Editor and 'greatest collaborator', was at shaping the films which he wrote and directed. The editor who assumed the late Menke's role was Fred Raskin, whose filmography contains such fast-paced flicks as the The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), Fast and Furious (2009) and Fast Five (2011). The title says it every time, 'fast', and Raskin who is obviously used to quick cutting brings an uncharacteristic pace to the film when compared to Tarantino's previous work. Right from the first scene it is evident that Raskin deviated from Tarantino's previous stylistic goals while editing the first cut during production. In the initial scene the pace of the editing is far too quick and the focal points tend to jump all over frame between these quick-cuts; ultimately disorienting the viewer and does not achieve what he could have been delivered more powerfully. Tarantino could fix only so many problems with Raskin's work, and since film is a collaboration he clearly had to compromise in certain areas. Compounded upon the shoddy editing, we have some pretty awful music choices which detract from the film and present no added benefit, albeit the opening theme is superb. There truly is a better film hiding in-between the poor editing and improper music choices. I'd say give Django a watch, if only to listen to the great dialogue... Take it this way, if I was blind this film would have come off much better. From the great highs to the unforgivable lows, Tarantino's sly cameo is one of the more entertaining moments where he refers to Django as 'black', and not as a 'n****r' like everyone else. Overall, Django Unchained only succeeds in being offensive, failing atrociously where Tarantino's films have flourished so well in the past. However, with my pretensions aside, one cannot deny Taratino's deft skill as a controversial and entertaining film-maker. S",9,1,5,19 June 2018
