Hereditary," Disjointed and Strange
",There are amazing actors but it feels like anything meaningful to this must be on the cutting room floor. The pace is like waiting for that flower that only blooms once every 20 or so years Overblown background music intended to make up for bad editing I love Toni but this felt like a dark remake of the United States of Tara,1,4,8,3 July 2018
A Quiet Place," It is a movie after all
","I finally got to watch this after just seeing Hereditary. Now is you want to see a ridiculous movie that is the one to go to.Everyone keeps picking apart the film. For me the only odd thing was the actual fields of corn. That did not exactly make sense but as to other things. I believe when you have fear you do not always act rationally. As for the kid walking last. It is very clear people have no clue about parenting. We start at day 89. Anyone knows after a long weekend your kids could drive you over the edge so imagine this world where you are one of only a handful who have somewhat adapted and really it is cuz you have a deaf kid. And all these people going on about the falls. FFS how is someone supposed to silently get all their crap over to that falls and or build something. It over covers so much.I was impressed but the films ability to make EVERYONE in the theater jump all together And the whole argument for avoiding pregnancy during the apocalypse.. really they are supposed to pop back down to that drugstore for a dose of plan b? The film has a few odd things but overall I found it well-acted, well edited and it completely absorbed me and seemingly the other 30 or so folks in the theater so get over the armchair quarterbacking and try to see the story here ... cuz there definitely was one.",8,2,3,7 July 2018
Shrek the Third," Been There Done That
","Standing alone this movie holds it's own against the countless other feature-length cartoons we have been treated to recently.That is the problem -- you cannot view it as a standalone work. The first Shrek is an excellent movie. While the original Shrek bore no resemblance to the original book by William Steig (yeah and who actually knows this was based on a book older than most of the audience). BTW, CDB and CDC are must reads from this author more well known for his work in the New Yorker...Shrek the Third makes the mistake of believing it's own hype. For most well-loved movie 'classics' of our time it is the story that makes the movie. Bringing a good story tells itself regardless of its surrounding. Good animation can enhance a wonderful story, but on it's own it is just disjointed bits hung on a clothesline. It seems like the original idea was left on the cutting room floor in the mad dash for marketing money.The collective comedic talent in this movie is astounding. John Cleese and Eric Idle, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as well as Cheri Oteri, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph. You also have John Krasinski and Rupert Everett. While their voices are memorable, this is the least of their abilities. They were given no opportunity to feature their true talents and the movie suffered for it. I was so hoping to see witty barbs and new site gags in the movie (and an actual plot) and was left wanting. The producers would have served themselves well to break from the usual pattern of actors performing their voice overs alone and allowing the cast to interact, write and improvise ... something most of this cast is well-known for.Too bad -- it could have been so much more.",3,1,4,21 May 2007
