Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," No Disappointment
","I READ AND WATCH, HOLMES!This movie, 'Sherlock Holmes : A Game of Shadows' is not originally same with the novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. At least, I noted that there are 4 stories combined :-The Final Problem (main story) -A Scandal of Bohemian (Holmes-Adler love story begin) -The Adventure of Empty House (About Sebastian Moran) -Improvement from script writer of SH:AGoSI am quite impressed and excited with this second sequel. The points I like much : -Scene on the train to Brighton, Holmes and Watson did awesome trick! -Scene when Holmes, Gypsy, and friends escape from Moran and boys -The final scene of Holmes-Moriarty, at the top of Reichenbach Fall. -The Sick-jokes is so British! This is Recommended Movie to alive Holmes character. Almost of reviewers said 'No Disappointment!', So do I!^_^PS : It's my first time to write movie review, so sorry whether I made some mistakes in grammatical and language. ^_^",9,0,3,29 December 2011
