The Avengers," Awesome Movie.... nice blend of all the solos
","Amazing movie, It lives up to its hype.. Josh Whedon has done an amazing job of blending from all the solo movies and giving us the perfect taste which stands for me as the one of the best movies of 2012. He ensured that he has a role for each of the character, rather than focusing of few main characters only. Personally liked the character of iron man and Hulk. The best part is keeping humor hand to hand with the action scene, which ensures perfect entertainment for the viewer. Special effects were breathtaking and execution was seamless. Apart of the storyline up, all the actors lived up to the expectation. Must watch at-least of 2-3 times...",9,2,6,28 April 2012
