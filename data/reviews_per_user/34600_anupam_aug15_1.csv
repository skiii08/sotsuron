Skyfall," Below Average !!!
","I think this was the worst bond movie ever !!! Have the story writers ran out of ideas that they took ideas from so many films like die hard 4 for hacking , home alone for fight sequence at Scotland home and so many other places. My first reaction after watching the movie was ' WTF ? Its over ??? Did I miss anything ?? ' This film neither has Hi Tech gadgets which bond movies are famous for nor any kind of action . The final fight sequence at Scotland home is beyond understanding and imagination . And Daniel Craig ! whatever he does there can never replace Pierce Brosnan . He looks awful in all the romantic scenes . Its high time the makers of Bond series hire better story writers and may be go back to Brosnan else its SKYFALL for Bond series.",2,7,16,31 December 2012
