The Blair Witch Project," A welcome change to the tried-and-tested horror genre
","I went to see The Blair Witch Project with my girlfriend and my uncle two days ago.  After reading all the hype and watching The Curse Of The Blair Witch on SkyOne I thought it would be a great horror film.After leaving the cinema we thought it was 'pretty good'.  It had a unique way of putting you in the film and believing you were there. For a horror film there's nothing really happening in it, except for getting lost in the forrest. It wasn't until that night and the next day that I kept thinking about it and realised just how scary it was (it's not easy for me to get scared at anything - my favourites are horror).  I realized just how far their minds had gone (Mike sitting on the ground rocking back and forward was a bit eerie). It was done very well in the fact that there is no real entity you can see and fight against - there's no big monster or lunatic with a knife to be scared of - it's just psychological horror.I'm was more scared of the film yesterday than I was just after I watched it.  I think that's because you don't realize how close they were to snapping until you think about the film afterwards.",Null,0,1,6 November 1999
