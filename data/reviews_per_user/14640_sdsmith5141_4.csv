The New World," very good movie
","This movie was different than what I thought. There was a lot more romance than what I expected. I expected for it to be mainly about the struggles and politics between the settlers and Indians with the romance between John Smith and Pocahontas as a supporting plot. It started out that way but then the romance part basically took over. It seemed slow moving, but it was a wonderfully acted movie which is the reason why I gave it an eight out of ten score. The ending was rather abrupt and really needs to be redone, but I enjoyed it. The acting that really locked me in and grabbed my attention was the acting on the part of the indians - especially Pocohantis. She and the other indians really captured the essence of the native American Indians. Their emotions, form of humor, entertainment, politics, and temperament was very well portrayed by the cast - especially Pocohantis. The biography on her shows she is only fifteen. If this is accurate then she has a very bright future ahead of her. I will be disappointed if she doesn't win an award. Best acting performance I have seen since Denzel Washington in Training Day. I know they are two completely different roles, but Washington did a great job of portraying a corrupt cop just the same was as Kilcher portrayed Pocohantis.",8,6,13,23 January 2006
The Ring," Best horror movie
","I thought this movie was the scariest horror movie I have ever seen. From the teen's dead face in the closet at the beginning to the girl crawling out of the well and then out of the t.v. at the end and everything in between made this movie great. I read the comment in the beginning and it said that it was just silly. All horror is silly because it is not based on reality, but what makes a movie horrifying is our imagination. You have to have imagination for most everything that comes out of Hollywood especially horror films. I am not known to be emotional, but this movie actually made me move farther back in my seat when Samara crawled out of the well. The screaming teenagers that were probably underage helped with the effect. The reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it was a little slow at times. I was very surprised that the Ring 2 was just as good.",9,0,1,1 February 2006
Enemy at the Gates," Great movie
","This movie really did an excellent job of displaying the struggle of war on the Russian front. War is hell, and it was worse on the Russian front. Stalingrad is regarded as the most brutal battle of World War 2 and I believe it. I believe this movie is effective in proving it. Ed Harris did a great job of playing his role of the German sniper, Major Koenig. I think they could have found someone else to play the role of the Russian sniper, Vassily Zaitsev, but he did fine. I just think someone with a stronger personality like Matt Damon would have fit the role better. You can't find anybody better than Bob Hoskins to fit the role of Nikita Kruschev. He was perfect. The artwork was excellent. This movie showed the brutality of both sides, but I am sure it could have gone farther which I am glad it didn't. There is only a certain amount of brutality necessary to get the point across. It was not 100% accuraate which is why the movie is basically banned in Volgagrad, but why does anybody expect 100% from Hollywood. It is just a great movie",8,1,2,29 January 2006
The Sixth Sense," Unbelievable and retarded
","I can't believe this movie got an 8 out of 10 score. This whole movie was completely unbelievable. I know you need to have an imagination, but too much is required for this one. Why do I say this? The whole movie Bruce Willis is apparently dead, and is a ghost. You don't find this out until the end of the movie which is when Bruce Willis found out. He is able to have conversations with his wife while he is a ghost for an entire year and not figure out that he is dead? How can such conversations occur? They can't! There is no way possible that he could have gone an entire year and have these conversations with his wife. Conversations like Bruce Willis would ask a question and his wife would conveniently be thinking about the same topic and speak out loud and give an answer while not aware that Bruce Willis was there talking to her. How come Bruce Willis who is supposed to be dead doesn't have any wounds on him like the other dead people do? Why isn't the kid afraid of Bruce Willis like he is afraid of the other dead people? I think the only reason why so many people give this crap such a high rating is because they are just fascinated with the subject of ghosts. What a retarded movie. Too much imagaination required for me.",1,21,54,20 February 2006
