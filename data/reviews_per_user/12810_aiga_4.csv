The Hangover," Funniest movie of the year.
","Well, it might be that everything there is to say has already been said, but today I feel like sharing my opinion. I am one of those people who put their DVD players on repeat. Especially, if I like what I see. I saw this movie for the first time already long time ago, but I do watch it over and over again. Today was one of those days. I must say that even though I've seen it many times, it is still funny. I guess it is not that easy to come up with jokes that would be funny when repeated over and over. This team has done it. I am so impatient for the sequel. I do wish those guys most of luck and success in making the second film just as good and funny. I love the fact that this movie has a reality feel to it. No matter how ridiculous and impossible the situations are, it still seems plausible. Maybe it is because those guys could be anyone and everyone. Like who hasn't been to a wild party?! Well, maybe not as crazy as that Any way, it is something new and fresh in the vast sea of American-Pie-type movies and all those romantic comedies. Don't get me wrong! I liked the first American Pie. May be the second, but all those sequels and alike no, not really. And what's up with all those romantic comedies!? Girl meets boy, boy meets girl, and so on. Most of them are all the same. You can see them once and forget just as you exit the theater. Sometimes I catch myself guessing the turns of the plot and ruining the movie for my friends by telling them exactly how it is going to end. I don't like to be able to do that after the first twenty minutes. I like surprises. It is really rare nowadays that one gets that in a movie. There are so many things made that I can understand that it is hard to find an original subject and, even more, to surprise the viewer. Well, I would like to conclude this short account of my impressions by citing a friend of mine who said that this movie is the best thing that has happened in cinema this year.",10,4,8,12 October 2009
2012," It's all been done before... and better.
","I was very lucky to get to see this movie before its official airing at a press-release in Riga, Latvia. I was so excited! I had been waiting for this movie since I first heard about its being in production. It has been a while since there was a decent catastrophe-movie. Well, at least not since The Day After Tomorrow (I so loved that one!). So, that was the idea I had bouncing in my head when I trotted down to the theater to see the end of the world in 2012. I got comfortable in my seat as I waited impatiently for the show to start. After all, it is more than two hours long. And finally it started! So, for me this was the peak moment of the movie. From that point on my excitement got deflated. Well, I admit, I might have been over-excited about it. I might have been too caught up in The Day After Tomorrow. It is one of my favorite catastrophe-movies. I was expecting an equally good story. Something new, maybe. I don't know much about making movies - I haven't made one, but I can recognize a good story. That is the key element I am looking for, but didn't find in 2012. In fact, it was a bad reproduction of The Day After Tomorrow. It's greatest problem is the incredibly week storyline. Come on! If you are going to spend millions of dollars on CGI, you might as well come up with a good-enough story to go with that. Something new, maybe This one is so predictable. It does not have a shred of originality and it is filled with clichés, and it is out of balance. I felt like there was the idea of the end of the world, which was not the background situation against which the story took place, but, in fact, the main character itself. I guess, I could say that it was overwhelming. Then there was this whole bunch of other stuff going on which didn't really made me care. It was like Yeah! So? I have seen it before. It was exactly the same. As you might have understood, I was disappointed in it. 2012 had some good actors playing the parts, but the story was all empty and cheesy, and the characters were not developed enough. However, I must admit that the CGI was awesome. If nothing else, you can enjoy that. And if you sit close enough to the screen (like I usually do), you might almost get to experience the feeling that you are witnessing the destruction of the world right there on the spot and get the sensation of general closure. That is the way it might happen. Any way, don't expect any more of it than the special effects – there isn't. In spite of my disappointment, I strongly believe that people differ and so do their tastes in films. No objective opinion is possible. I'm just expressing my own. If you feel that you might like this movie, go right ahead, and see for your self. Then write your own comment.",4,26,53,10 November 2009
Avatar," Amazing! Must-see movie!
","Today I saw the beginning of a new era – I had the opportunity to be one of the first to see Avatar. I tell you! It is amazing!!! It is a must-see movie. Every one should experience it at least once. I can honestly call it my movie of the year. It might be even more than that – the movie of a decade. I had been waiting to see it, and for once my expectations were rewarded.It is a breath-taking almost three hour ride in the world you could not imagine existed. After the movie my colleagues were saying that they didn't want it to end. I felt the same. I didn't want to leave this dangerous yet amazingly beautiful place where everything is so bright and colorful, and exciting. It is amazing that there are people with imagination powerful and creative enough to bring such an experience for the rest of us. There were several people at the screening who originally were not interested in sci-fi or this movie in particular. They all liked it very much though. I believe it is due to the storyline. The story may not be the most original one, but it is that which moves all people at all times. It is a tale of love and fighting for a cause. It is a tale of a charismatic hero finding his true identity and place in the world. It is a tale where good triumphs over bad. This is what attracts people at all times. No more, no less. Just as important is the fact that the story is well told. You won't miss any details. Everything is explained well and to the point. There are no long overwhelming scenes. The story just moves fluidly forward and takes you on a magical ride. I must make a remark regarding the much-discussed technological achievements. CGI is incredible! You can't tell where the real thing ends and the CGI begins. Well, you can, but just because you know that it doesn't exist on our planet. It is so believable and therefore so fascinating. I despise those that claim that all of it looks just like a very expensive computer game. NO! It does not! Go see it! See it in 3D if possible. I feel that this new technology offers some great possibilities. It has been said that a new era in cinematography begins with Avatar. It so does and I cannot wait to see what it has to offer. So, I invite everyone to go and see this new world of Avatar. You won't be sorry!",10,93,176,16 December 2009
Up in the Air," He's a sad and lonely man... but the movie is great!
","It is great! I could say that it is brilliant even. I just saw it recently, but lately (since 'Avatar' :D) it is the best I've seen. George Clooney is a great actor. I do love him not just because I'm a girl (Let's face it! Women love him because he is what he is.), but because he gives great performances one after another. A movie with his name in the titles guarantees a good time. So, yeah! I'm a fan. But let's speak about the movie... I loved it. I loved its fresh humor, the sadness of the story and how it was blended to make a perfect, refreshing cocktail. This is a movie about a man who has lived all his life in a certain manner, is used to certain things and ways, is committed to a life of a bachelor (Even more than that! He doesn't even have an address that he would call his home, and basically lives out of a suitcase by choice.). He denies family and marriage. All the interaction he needs he gets from flight attendants (That's an overstatement, but it basically explains his level of need for other people.) One day this man realizes that the philosophy, he has been living by, might be flawed and he just might want to try out some of that regular stuff that all of us are dreaming off since we were 5 years old, or so. He just might commit to another person. And guess what!!! It all blows up in his face! It seams so unfair... so sad. He was ready to change his life for another person, but it turned out, nobody needed him different. I felt so sorry for this man. He has shut himself off from the world and now, that he wants to rejoin, it doesn't let him. Is it too late at some point to change your stars??? I guess that the lesson is: be careful what you wish for - you might just get it. SO, the actors were great. George of course! I love Vera Farmiga. She is great and charming as always. I must point out Anna Kendrick's performance. She has something. I must agree with the many comments out there who all claim that she has a great potential. I truly enjoyed her performance. It is nothing like the Twilight saga. Good luck to her! But all these wonderful actors were brought together to tell an interesting and fresh story. Not everyone will like it, but it's a smart movie. It's not for everyone.",9,0,3,29 January 2010
