E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An American Movie Treasure
","When asked what I think the greatest movie of all time is, this one comes to mind.  Along with Casablanca, Gone With the Wind, Psycho, Jaws, The Wizard Of Oz, and Schindler's List, E.T. deserves to be ranked as one of the top 10 of all time.  It is just such a wonderful story, compared to all the garbage Hollywood has been putting out. Bravo to Steven Spielberg for creating a film that will be in the hearts and minds of everyone forever.",Null,0,0,16 September 2002
