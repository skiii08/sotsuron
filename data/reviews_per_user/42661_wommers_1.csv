Requiem for a Dream," This film will make you breathe a sigh of relief..
","..not for it's awfulness, not at all. I think I went through every negative emotion whilst watching this film. That sounds like it should be a bad thing and it's true - I did feel very uncomfortable at times watching this. However, the effect this film has on you is simply mindblowing.. a film hasn't had an effect on me like this since I watched the Japanese version of The Ring (which ranks highly as one of the most mentally disturbing film I've ever seen).The acting, sense of togetherness you feel to the main character and the sheer shock at the film's climax are something you simply have to experience. I'm essentially re-iterating all that has been said in previous reviews of this film but after watching this film I felt I had to comment on it's brilliance.It takes a certain person to watch this film and if you've never known addition of any sort, this will probably be horrendous viewing to you. Perversely, however, I get the feeling this is the whole point of the film.Simply awesome.",10,1,2,24 September 2006
