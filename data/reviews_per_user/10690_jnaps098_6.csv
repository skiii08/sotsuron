Sucker Punch," Kryptonite...feel weak...
","I so wanted to love this movie. Sadly, it made for a better trailer.From a production aspect, this movie is really Zack Snyder's love child. Every frame looks so incredible and gorgeous that it would make a stellar movie poster. But that is all the movie offers.Apart from Oscar Isaac and the brief supporting role by Scott Glenn, I though the rest of the performances were terrible. Worst being the leading lady Emily Browning. The entire movie is a big fantasy, her character is doing all this kick-ass stuff but she goes through each fantasy sequence like she is a victim and under a lot of pain.The movie is very poorly written. I did not care or feel for any lead characters; and they were the underdogs. Generally movies like this I'd be rooting for them. Of course it tries to get at soppy in the end. It works a bit but cant save the rest of the bad writing. And speaking of the end, after train mission, the story really wraps up in a tearing hurry, which was probably a smart move.Another gripe...I wasn't very happy with the first fight sequence, the one with the 3 samurai(?). It looked stunning but something about the choreography just did not work for me, it felt shabby. The other fights were much better.And lastly, the slow-mo. Zack Snyder, enough already. The entire prologue is slow-mo and felt especially tiring. All in all, it looks like the new Superman movie will carry a few punches; but if this movie is any indication, Supes may not fly too high. Hope Christopher Nolan holds the reins tightly.:((",4,4,10,28 March 2011
Gravity," Sandra Bullock and A Series of Unfortunate Events
","That's the movie in a nutshell. Disaster strikes less that 10 minutes into the movie and just doesn't let up. It was tense and edge-of-the-seat for a while but got extremely predictable half way through. Sadly, the story doesn't evolve into into something bigger/better. I can't believe the hype around this movie. For me it didn't come anywhere close the drama in Apollo 13 or Moon, both of which I found riveting.On all technical and production aspects this movie gets high marks. This is the most authentic looking space exploration movie yet. The way they've depicted objects interaction with each other in space is frankly astounding. Great cinematography and score. This movie should be quite an Oscar contender for the technical awards.",6,0,1,15 October 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Returns
","I absolutely loved the previous film. It was a huge tip of the hat to the Star Trek legacy. It turned a couple of things inside out which made it interesting, fresh and exciting. And with a few surprises thrown in, it was a perfect package.Into Darkness is just more of the same. The whole movie has J.J. Abrams and team continuing taking old plots & events and putting it in their alternate time line. The film is chock a block with these this time around. Sadly its not novel anymore and it all seems forced. Like Superman Returns, the film makers got so busy with what has happened that they just forgot to do anything new with it.Its disappointing to admit that after 2 movies, there actually isn't anything new added to the Star Trek universe. Not one single thing. In fact, now the Enterprise has been built, damaged, repaired, damaged and repaired for the second time (No spoiler here. The poster has the ship going down in flames), and they have not yet started on their space voyages, which is what the ship was build for, the purpose of the crew, the core and essence of Star Trek.",5,15,34,16 May 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Which movie did I just watch?
","Scientist developing serum to enhance human potential. Serum close to finish but not ready for human testing. Scientist's funding is removed. In desperation scientist tests serum on himself. Serum works on scientist but also makes him very aggressive. Scientist terrorizes city. Spiderman saves the day.Which spider-man movie am I talking about?Its understandable that as a reboot, much of Spiderman origin can't really be changed. But what about the rest? How lazy can you get? They should have just 'digitally remastered' the original, made it 3D and re-released. Would have saved a bunch of money. Even the friggin' serum was green.Peter Parker becomes Spiderman when he walks into a room with 1000 odd identical spiders and is bitten by one of them. Any one else walking into the room has pretty much the same chances. And does Peter Parker steal the web vials from Oscorp? Nice.",3,21,43,5 July 2012
Django Unchained," Not quite up to the mark
","I thought Inglorious Basterds was just fantastic. Each scene had so much tension built up, its almost difficult to watch the entire movie in one sitting. Django Unchained is far tamer in comparison. It's a pretty good movie but does not really reach the level of brilliance of Inglorious Basterds. It does have a couple of tension filled moments but quite as nail biting for me.Terrific performances all around. The stand out performance for me was Samuel L Jackson. Can't believe that was Nick Fury, incredible! My biggest disappointment was the character played by Christoph Waltz. I felt if his character in this movie was swapped with the one he played in Inglorious Basterds, there would be no difference what so ever. Not sure why Tarantino would do that, except for the fact the Waltz plays that character brilliantly.Overall, I think what works most, is that Tarantino has given this movie some breathing room from Inglorious Basterds (unlike the rapid fire from M. Night Shyamalan which grew tiring quickly). If this movie had come out a couple of years earlier, it would have been far more disappointing.",7,2,6,13 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman...The Messiah
","He took others sin upon himself to protect his world (read Gotham). He was persecuted for it. But he still loved his people. And finally gave the ultimate sacrifice so that the world would be saved. Sound familiar? Everything Nolan did with the first two movies made Batman very plausible. This movie is some where between the comic book world and theology and just doesn't seem to be sure what it is. For me its a huge let down from the predecessors. In fact, I'm not even sure if this is a 'Batman' movie...Batman barely even made it to the screen, probably had the same amount of time as Catwoman. So Batman was a supporting character in this movie.Rock solid performances by the whole cast but completely let down by an overambitious script trying hard to be bigger in scale than its predecessor. Catwoman was the only 'human' and 'plausible' part of the movie. The only smart piece of the script in my opinion. And kudos to Anne Hathaway for delivering on it.I must admit, the first thought that ran through my mind after Avengers was how soon can I get to watch it again. No such feelings here; in fact far from it. I'm debating if I'd want this Blu-ray when it comes out. :(",5,2,7,24 July 2012
