Blade Runner 2049," Breathtaking - A Near Perfect Cinematic Achievement
","I am going to offend when I write how the original Blade Runner left me disappointed. By the end, there were too many unanswered questions for me not to feel anything but jaded. Blade Runner 2049 on the other hand, left me riveted. Ryan Gosling is not exactly synonymous with action films, though from the opening scene, he proves himself to be a powerful, heroic figure. Unlike the original, which toyed with the idea that Deckard was a replicant, 2049 adamantly admits to K's (Gosling) status almost immediately. Though I could criticise Blade Runner 2049 for its anti-climatic finish, it does three things brilliantly. First, the film answers the burning questions the original refused to dignify. Secondly, the film captures the essence of the original's universe. The world feels lived in; where technology and the metal skeletons of architecture blend; where clear demographics and political allegiances exist, an 'us versus them' feel emerging that mirrors the world we live in today. Thirdly, the film immerses the viewer instantly with not just the mystery of its story, but with its score. The sound is thunderous and impactful, exploding across the screen with tremendous effect, while the raw, visceral musical score accompanies this perfectly, serenading us with themes that don't just resemble, in part, the original, but a unique cyber punk style too.The effects are phenomenal, from the fluctuating holographic interfaces, to the flying cars; from the impressive explosions to the dystopian backwaters which surround the spurring metropolis; the effects satisfyingly developing an imperfect future. Although the effects are a necessity in Blade Runner 2049, never does the feature become over-reliant on them, the film's leads been the driving force of this cinematic achievement.The film's introduction sees K completing his manhunt of Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), an older model replicant, who has found some semblance of peace. K however finds himself caught up in an even bigger investigation, the ramifications of which could be dire, his lieutenant, Joshi (portrayed effectively by Robin Wright), spurring her infallible asset on. It is here we are introduced to Jared Leto's Niander Wallace, the mastermind behind the new generation replicants. Despite been in only a few scenes, his calculated malice sends cold tones throughout the feature, and is further delivered upon by his assistant, Luv (Sylvia Hoecks), whose lack of decency for human life is frighteningly human.Much like the original, Blade Runner 2049 questions what makes us human, and why in the future we would attempt to differentiate ourselves from our creation, when they begin to adopt our traits. Though Gosling's K appears robotic in his movements at times, in his relationships, especially that with virtual intelligence Joi (the lovely Ana De Armas), we witness how human he truly is, their romance been as inventive as it is beautiful. The film takes itself very seriously when demonstrating the poignancy of machines sharing a connection, though the themes of slavery and child-labour, despite still been major topics today, are only briefly discussed.Acting greats like the always entertaining Lenny James, Hiam Abbas, and Edward James Olmos (reprising his role from the original) briefly appear, and despite portraying characters with barely enough screen time to be truly appreciated, their performances nonetheless propel the narrative forward. Furthermore, though Harrison Ford receives second billing, it is not until much later into the film that we are blessed by his on screen presence, his version of Deckard retaining the old 'shoot first ask questions later' routine of his character, yet being deeply melancholic and sympathetic. Blade Runner 2049 is at its core, a futuristic romance, about the importance of freedom, sacrifice and family; a film that gives me hope for the future of Hollywood. This feature is possibly the best film I have seen this year, Denis Vileneuve again proving himself to be an outstanding director.",10,247,522,5 October 2017
The Lion King," The Lion's Share of Nostalgia
","The Lion King is great - that is a fact. The original animated film is Disney gold, and this film captures that, for the most part, incredibly well. But...so often, the film is just a carbon copy of the original, scene for scene, with the same soundtrack, songs, cinematography and moments. True, there are some additional scenes added in, and some changes do occur, don't get me wrong, and occasionally, John Oliver as Zazu and Seth Rogen as Pumbaa insert some alternate, and very funny lines, but the film is, at its core, so close to being a mirror image to the original, that it's surreal. I will admit, the special effects are utterly perfect, and truly breathtaking to watch. It is impossible to tell this utterly perfect work of art apart from reality. That aside, it is still just a copy. Who has seen The Poseidon Adventure? Who saw The New Poseidon Adventure? Who saw Poseidon? All different - similar story, but each offer their own unique take on the narrative. Who saw Godzilla 1954? Who saw the 1997 American remake? (God help me, I'm actually using this film to make a point). Who saw Godzilla 2014? Each of these films bring something new to the properties, with each project being vastly different. The Lion King however, is thoroughly predictable.Some people will argue that is a good thing, and I understand that. Those I saw the movie with this evening said it reminded them of their childhood; their old friends, and what they used to do. It was incredibly nostalgic and melancholic for them, and I can't deny that I occasionally felt chills just watching it (in a good way, mind you). Donald Glover and Beyoncé absolutely knock it out of the park with their rendition of the tunes, and their voice acting of the central protagonists was really on the mark (though Beyoncé deserved significantly more opportunities because, you could just tell, she was loving the role). Florence Kasumba as hyena leader, Shenzi, was a definite stand out; she brought an undeniable sinisterness to the role that was absent from the animated feature, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was just sublime. Ejiofor's voice alone gave amazing presence to the film, capturing Scar's cunning ruthlessness, making him just as appealing an antagonist as ever. As for James Earl Jones as Mufasa, what can I say? I could listen to that man's voice all day long - he still managed to offer some changes in the way he performed his lines in contrast with the original, despite there again, being vast similarities, and it was brilliant to listen to him give the grand king life once more.The changes to the elephant graveyard scene were especially brilliant, and the many new faces added to the habitat that Timon and Pumbaa inhabit were cute, cuddly and added more character to the environment, making it feel more lived in. One massive change from the film however, is the significant lack of any physical emotions. Though the actors deserve kudos for the emotive performances they provide, the faces of the animated characters presenting these lines, remind stoic at best, even in the most emotive moments. Don't get me wrong, this feature still has some emotively powerful occasions, though some of the animated films most tragic moments did not affect me as dearly in this adaptation, whereas others had an even more profound affect.At the end of the day, I would recommend this movie, however, so much that it does right, is just lifted from the original. As a teacher, I often tell my students that copying is a bad thing - having your own spin on it, and adding your own personality to something, to make it your own, is what makes it great, and I just wish that director, Jon Favreau, would have taken the opportunity to do something more with this beloved classic.",7,45,142,12 July 2019
Jurassic World," Disappointing: Much like the Dinosaurs this Film Represents, the Jurassic Park Franchise ought to Remain Extinct
","Don't get me wrong - there is plenty of entertainment to be had when viewing Jurassic World: the special effects are absolutely outstanding, and we are able to cherish these when viewing the creatures right up in our faces. Unlike many films where monsters are hidden by the darkness, in this film, they are beautifully presented in direct visibility. Not only this, many of the action scenes are truly breathtaking in their execution, the climatic moments being especially fantastic, however, these are often marred by predictability, the final sequence being a combination of several fight scenes from the original feature, and Jurassic Park 3. Regrettably, in other instances, including a scene involving pterosaurs, and another involving raptors, the script's directionality offers nothing new, as we watch what can only be described as tweaked footage from previous installments, regardless of how good they look. This is unfortunately furthered by the fact that those who have viewed the trailers, will already have a strong inkling of what is going to happen in almost every major scene.Although In-Gen still have a role to play in the feature, their priorities appear to be strictly military, a tactic which is strongly led by Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio), who efficaciously portrays his greedy, self-centered character. Although the notion of using dinosaurs, particularly raptors, during military operations is interesting, and seeing this executed on screen is probably the most uniquely entertaining experience the film is able to muster, this grand scheme seems outlandishly ridiculous. Furthermore, at times, it seems difficult to fathom who is actually in control - Hoskins, or park owner Masrani (Irrfan Khan), who is introduced as one of the world's richest men, and though he is hailed as a man with 'humility', the moment everything goes terribly wrong, money and reputation, rather than safety, are his top priorities. Despite a number of superb scenes, for the most part, his character recites juvenile dialogue, and it left this writer wondering if Mr. Khan was sadly, racially chosen because of his accent.This is not helped by the script, which, despite the seriousness of the operation, doesn't always retain the professionalization one would expect. Characters like Scott (Andy Buckley), who is provided far too much screen time, spends the entirety of his scenes vocalizing what can only be described as pointless dialogue, while characters like Dr. Henry Wu (B D Wong), who terrifically shows the passion he has for his work, are rarely glimpsed. Even Owen, although exceptionally portrayed by the dashingly handsome Chris Pratt, whose character is a reliably effective protagonist, is initially provided some rather sexist material, conveyed in the scene where he communicates with former girlfriend and operations manager Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who, despite been an effective marketer, spends more than half the film being interpreted as an emotionless zealot.This impression is only furthered by her inability to be an aunt to her sister's two children vacationing at the park, Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson). More often than not, these children appear to steal the show, much of the plot, from the film's opening to its close, orbiting around them, and though this allows us to see the park from their eyes, their behavior, and recklessness, quickly loses its appeal. The addendum that Zach, no offense, is a sleaze bag, doesn't help: the opening of the feature sees him saying goodbye to his girlfriend, and for half the movie, he has the gall to attempt fraternization with every adolescent girl he sees.Moving on, the primary antagonist, the Indominus Rex, the creature scientifically engineered by splicing together classified dinosaur genetics, which predictably escapes, is able to masterfully command the screen with its presence, though at the same time, its unique capabilities appear to be randomly used. On many an occasion it appears the creature is capable of doing what was convenient for the scene; almost as though the monster itself is unsure of its capabilities and learns overtime from practice. Despite its massive build, more could have been done to make this creature more terrifying, and the fact it too closely resembles a Tyrannosaurs, renders it less effective on screen as it would have, if it looked vastly different.The sub-plot, about humans forming a bond with dinosaurs is a nice addition to the narrative, and helps establish the ancient reptiles as more than just killing machines, but as potentially loyal animals, however, the fact the Indominus steals the show, severely limits the effectiveness of this story arch. Additionally, the accompanying musical score occasionally adds to the environment, however, the original John Williams theme appears to be recklessly handled, and is inserted in what seems to be the most inappropriate of locations.In conclusion, our return to the park feels less than impressive, and more stereotypically cliché, and despite the term 'world' appearing in its title, the staggering number of Caucasians, makes it seem the 'world' is barely represented at all. The fact the film is left wide open for yet another sequel, a little too obviously demonstrates Universal's opinion they have tapped a lucrative oil well, however, any further forays into the park are only likely to end in disaster. If you are thoroughly impressed by Mr. Pratt's work, I would recommend you watch this film; if you really enjoy Mr. Khan's on screen presence, I would recommend you avoid this feature, and for fans of the franchise still reeling after the abysmal third movie, I would recommend you stick to the original two films.",6,35,75,10 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Episode Seven is a Force to be Reckoned With
","The opening of Star Wars, The Force Awakens, with the titles traveling along the screen, and the orchestra following in the background, immediately absorbed me into the experience. Although I initially feared this sequel would fall flat, from the very beginning, the film sends its audience on a magnificent ride across the galaxy. There are significant gaps in the story-line, from the conclusion of the last installment up until this point in time, some of which are addressed over the film's duration, while others will hopefully be answered in future episodes. Despite some segments of the film bearing a striking resemblance to scenes encountered in previous installments, these are so well delivered, they offer the viewer moments of nostalgia, that have not been felt, since the original trilogy, all those years ago.Acting heavy-weights, like Harrison Ford in his return as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, help revitalize the franchise, though their screen time is minimal in contrast with the new faces. Ford offers both a melancholic and nostalgic performance, that lends emotion to his scenes, as a former war hero turned smuggler, while his take charge attitude, and banter with Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), remains as entertaining as ever. Max Von Sydow additionally has a cameo role, of significant import, though again, deserved more time on screen.Rey (Daisey Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, who scroungers desperately to survive, while awaiting the return of her lost family. When she encounters a droid, BB-8, she has no idea of the adventure, not to mention the danger, she has inadvertently put herself in. Holding information vital to both the Resistance, the protagonists in the film, and the First Order, the villainous group that has taken over from the Galactic Empire, it seems almost everyone in the galaxy is seeking its retrieval. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a Sith with an interestingly poignant past, is one such character who pursues the droid, in the hopes of capturing the information contained within.Driver, most known for his comedic roles, is especially great, being as villainous as he is sentimental, brilliantly demonstrating a man with no control over his emotions. In contrast, fellow villains, including General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie), don't appear as frequently, nor receive as much depth, which is unfortunate, considering how interesting their characters are.When Rey encounters Finn (John Boyega), a storm trooper, who despises the violent actions of the First Order, they are forced to make a series of difficult choices, that will lead them on a journey across the universe. Boyega and Ridley are equally terrific in their roles, and are great characters for the audience to follow, demonstrating acts of heroism and courage throughout the film.Furthermore, landscapes across the universe depict planets that have continued on after the war with the Galactic Empire, the remnants of fallen behemoths dotting the horizons. The vehicles and weaponry that are utilized, remind audiences of episodes four thought to six, and the moment the light sabre makes its appearance, I doubt a single person will be able to contain their excitement.The soundtrack is very much reminiscent of the franchise, and legitimizes the experience. The special effects are incredible, from battles in outer space, to fights on the ground, lasers and explosions littering the battlefield of the frequent, and fast paced, action scenes. Though Episodes Seven is basically one action scene after the next, the script provides enough emotional depth and characterization between these scenes, to keep audiences invested. Not only this, humor is well incorporated, the banter between characters, alongside the one-liners, bringing a series of laughs, beside the frenetic explosions.To view the film in 3D offers the viewer significant depth, though moments when characters, props, or the general setting, jump out at the audience, are quite minimal. When this does occur, often it is from the left, or the right of the screen, rather than from the very center, making the effect less impressive. If you were hoping to feel as though you might get hit at any moment by an incoming laser, sadly, that will not transpire here.Though a couple of moments during the plot are predictable, Star Wars Episode Seven is a brilliant return to a franchise that was originally only meant to house six episodes. If this new installment is what we ought to expect from the upcoming films, then the Star Wars universe is looking very bright indeed.",9,73,165,16 December 2015
Furious 7," Entertainingly Impressive, Brilliantly Witty and Emotionally Established. However...
","The opening of Fast and Furious 7 unleashes Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw upon the screen, the older brother of Owen (Luke Evans), the lead antagonist from the previous feature. The power exhibited during this opening however is seldom felt again, and despite Mr Statham's astounding capabilities, the script inhibits his quality to the extent that he is generally about as threatening as a pebble in one's shoe.Upon Deckard igniting his quest for vengeance against Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and the other individuals involved in hospitalizing his brother, by killing Han (Sung Kang), Toretto, who, as always, is marvelously portrayed, finds himself outmatched. A man with the alias Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), a high ranking CIA operative, who is as suave as he is cool, approaches him. Tasked in removing Deckard, Mr. Nobody provides Toretto with an opportunity to get out in front of his opponent with a device called God's Eye, capable of hacking into all video surveillance devices and utilizing them to find anyone in the world. Unfortunately, the creator of this software, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) has been abducted by terrorists, and as any action by America would constitute an international incident, alternate means are necessary for a safe extraction - enter Toretto and his crew. With the device, they will be able to track Deckard - however, like any film, it is never that simple.Unfortunately, this particular plot seems awfully redundant. Returning to the 'pebble in one's shoe' reference, Deckard continuously shows up at every confrontation to acquire his pound of flesh - basically, Toretto needn't fly halfway across the world for some gadgetry - he could just plant himself on a park bench and wait half an hour for Deckard to come to him. True, the storyline makes for some outstanding car sequences: ploughing through trees while crashing down a cliff; cruising through a luxurious suite on one of the topmost floors of a tower; racing down the streets of Los Angeles with a Predator drone in tow, among others, are all fantastically executed, though none of it feels to have been a legitimate requirement. Moreover, almost all of the action scenes require suspension of disbelief, the fact the characters are capable of surviving some of the incidents being highly suspicious.The banter exhibited between Tyrese Gibson as Roman, and Ludicrous as Tej, is as humorous and witty as it was in the previous installment, if not even more entertaining, the few stunts Tej becomes involved in really accentuating his character's persona. Even Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has more than a few memorable one-liners, despite his small role, and the inclusion of Eden Estrella as his charmingly enjoyable daughter Samantha, adds further depth. However, it is Michelle Rodriguez as Letty, whose performance is the most outstanding. A conversation between her and Toretto at the beginning, where she reveals the heart-wrenching pain of being crippled by amnesia, sets the scene for her character's journey, and lines she admits towards the end of the feature are beautifully impacting.The tribute at the feature's end to Paul Walker is very touching, and the words Mr Diesel says are as brotherly as they are passionate. During the film, Mr Walker seems to have less screen time as Brian O'Connor than he had in previous movies. Any digital superimposing that was promulgated to complete his role in the movie was amazingly established, Brian's story focusing on whether he would dedicate himself to living with Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their son, as a father who drives a mini-van (one of the film's most comically painful scenes), or continue to involve himself in fierce confrontations.Despite Deckard been largely alone in his plot for vengeance, other antagonists are portrayed by the unmistakable Tony Jaa, who participates in a number of amazingly choreographed fights, and the always impressive Djimon Hounsou, as terrorist leader Jakande. Respectively, both actors received limited roles, and deserved more screen time, especially considering Mr. Hounsou's presence can equally rival Mr. Diesel's. Towards the end of the feature, it is annoying that Jakande is only capable of saying 'what?' almost a dozen times as his plans are individually and irreparably torn asunder, while the vendetta he has against Toretto is as immature as it is unnecessary.The musical score strongly resembles the former films, which assisted in immersing this feature in the franchise, and though, for the most part, the movie flowed gloriously, it was towards the end that the film began to feel unnaturally forced, the conclusion to the final battle being as anti-climatic as it is predictable. Too many coincidental moments flooded this movie, in which a protagonist arrived at the right moment to save another hero, while at the same time, unanswered questions, like, how a group of terrorists, armed with sophisticated technology, managed to make it onto American soil undetected - leave notable holes in the plot.For the most part, entertainingly, characteristically and emotionally, Fast and Furious 7 delivers on all fronts, with impressive visuals, action-packed scenarios, well executed humor, tension and drama. It is unfortunate the villains, who were equally superb, did not receive the same attention, and it is further unsatisfying that the concluding battle seems to crash and burn, much like some of the damaged vehicles.",8,83,110,2 April 2015
