Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Believe it or not, this is better than Ep. II
","When i first watched both films, i thought Phantom Menace was horrible and that Attack of the Clones was a huge improvement.However, having given it ALOT more thought, i think its actually the other way around...Ep1 employed the highest of production values, 'attempts' were made to keep it in the same spirit as the originals. True, Lucas failed miserably, as for Jar Jar ..(well i think enough has been said already)Anyways, EpII is not in the spirit of the original films. It is just one big attempt to make up for the failures of the first one. Jar Jar is given bugger all screen time (that God, but it still helps me prove my point) the action scenes were on a grander scale, and we got to see Yoda fight. etcHowever EpII has no direction, Anakin and Padme have zero chemistry, and the story has made me lose alot of respect for characters such as Boba Fett and Mace Windu. As for Dooku, that is a total cop out. Bad guys just dont spring out of the ground. It would have made more sense for Dooku to be a good guy, and have the Republic and the Jedi fighting on the wrong side. (think about it for 2seconds)Lucas dilivers 'what he thought the fans would want...' on the surface this may appear to work, but epII will not stand the test of time when people get over all eye candy.EpI is a much better film, because atleast Lucas did what he wanted and what he thought was right. He didnt cop out, and give in to preasure like he did with epII.EpI  -  3/5 EpII -  2/5",Null,0,1,28 June 2003
Troy," Troy: The Good and The Bad...
","The Good: Peter O'Toole Sean Bean Eric Bana Rose Byrne Brian Cox Fight SequencesThe Bad: Some of the dialogue THE MUSIC! (So disappointing considering how good the music in the trailer is)There have been a lot of reviews making very sweeping statements about this movie. Especially regarding the casting of Brad Pitt and the acting of Orlando Bloom. To be honest, the above is nothing to worry about, both do a more than adequate job. One review on here said the movie would have been spectacular if it was on mute. I didn't know what he/she meant, but I can laugh about it now. (they're right) As the only downsides to this movie is the music and some of the dialogue. Other than that it great entertainment. O'Toole was awesome (like there ever was a doubt) every scene Sean Bean was in boosted the credability of the film. I felt sorry for Eric Bana's character Hector which means he did his job well. Rose Byrne and Brian Cox were the two surprise packets, delivering powerful and believable performances. All of which adds to the theory that if you want a great epic: You can't leave all the acting to the Americans! one needs some Brits or Aussies.(like in.. Gladiator, Braveheart, Lord of the Rings and now Troy.)Don't worry about all the hype, this is a great and inexpensive way to spend an entertaining 3 hours. The scenery and fight sequences are awesome, it's almost worth paying to see how Brad Pitt moves with some of his weapons (shield especially).7/10",Null,46,70,13 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Not the left wing dribble some say...
","The Day after TomorrowI'll start by saying that I was pleasantly surprised. Being an American disaster movie this was always going to be in danger of being a cliché ridden piece of USA propaganda, but it wasn't. Many users are saying its left wing dribble but I wouldn't say that either. Granted the American Idea of left wing might differ from that of Australia's (where I'm from) but I found the story and the dialogue to be reasonable and believable.Some may accuse Jake Gyllenhaal of a stiff performance, but I think it's refreshing to see someone portrait a teenager/young adult the way he did. Instead of some mumbling bag of hormones Jake delivers a character with some depth who that gives thought to things. (Yes, young people do care about more than just drinking and throwing loud parties) I believe his performance was helped by the script. If something didn't need saying, nothing was said. This is a long overdue change from some of the crap lines Hollywood has been churning out. Dennis Quaid gives a faultless and believable performance. I've always been a fan of his and the producer's faith in him is not misplaced.The special effects in this movie made me sit back and think 'This is awesome.' It takes a lot for me to be impressed with effects as we're flooded with them. (excuse the pun) Combine some great CGI and a refreshing down to earth script, and you have a quality production titled 'The Day After Tomorrow.' Overall you could do a lot worse with your time and money, it made me stop and think for a second about what really is important and that itself makes this film a success.8/10",8,0,0,27 May 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Matrix Revolutions  The Choice is yours.
","I'll just start by saying that to make an effective and fair review of a movie/story one has to do a little research. I've noticed that people are complaining about certain aspects of the story in their reviews, particularly the place of secondary characters such as `The Kid'
These can be explained with a little research, I urge everyone to see the Annimatrix, preferably before seeing Reloaded or Revolutions as it help explains a lot. Sure some of the characters may seem a little cliché, but having a bit extra background knowledge of the story will help alleviate this. Having said all that, revolutions was better than I expected, I would place it between the original and Reloaded which was somewhat of a disappointment. There is a good mix of story and action, and you never know where the ride is going to take you. Some of the fighting between Smith and Neo is slightly tiresome as we all know it was never going to end with a fistfight. The battle for Zion is nothing short of spectacular, there was obviously a lot of effort and thought put into it. This movie can be enjoyed by the fans of the matrix story and scifi fans in general. Again it is a matter of choice, you can either focus on negative aspects (of which there are a few) or you can focus on the positive ones.",7,2,4,11 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Anyone that didn't enjoy this (or Fellowship) doesn't deserve the privilege of seeing it..
","All the hype and glamour surrounding this movie has, in one way or another blinded people.  If one sits back and takes an objective look at these two movies that can see how truly great they are. So much effort and thought went into the making of Lord of the Rings. It deserves a lot of credit, as it is one of the most complex stories ever written. The locations, the actors, the dialogue, the humour and the music are all top notch. Both movies ooze class on all grounds, and we're too blind to see it. Even those who enjoyed the films may have been swept up in it all, and could come to love it even more if they are more observant.I feel sorry for anyone that didn't enjoy both movies, your mind must be completely shut and void of all imagination. If you did your research into the magnitude of the story, you will know that no one could ever had directed, or made the movies any better. The sheer volume of material that had to be included would leave anyone for dead. But Peter Jackson managed to pull it off. Of those who don't care for a story of such brilliance and magnitude, at least have the intelligence to acknowledge the quality of the production.We live in a world where everyone thinks they're movie experts. Clear and detach your mind from all preconceived notions, sit back and watch both films again. Only then will you be able to appreciate the splendour of the story and the movies.I will be very surprised if anything even comes close to this trilogy in the next decade.It is truly worth 10/10.",10,0,0,26 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Into the West...
","When I saw Sam and Frodo climbing up mount doom I knew I was witnessing a cinematic and artistic moment which passes into a realm of honesty which has been lost in the current world and Hollywood environment.This is the only trilogy in which I find it hard to pinpoint which one stood out above the rest. Perhaps it is because one spiritual experience can't really be measured against another.I could ramble on about all the amazing performances by the actors, the inspiring locations, cinematography and the long list of things that couldn't have been done better by anyone else. However I'll just end this review by saying that if you can't see any merit in these masterpieces than I truly feel sorry for you, as you have lost all grasp of humanity and anything beyond itÂ…10/10",10,0,1,9 May 2004
