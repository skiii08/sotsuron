","Nolan really expressed all the points and all the minds I ever thought.This movie inculding multiple material .Macro philosophy causing you to consider plenty of issues.
Such as the mystery puzzle of the entire period since the first cell appeared.That is --LOVE.A father and children attachment each other .A female wanted to meet her lover even though she know he probably die.You just can explain in sicience it call hormone.Those emotions perfectly display in the movie.
 The scene of Mann with cooper communication is really touch me.Human survival instinct is singel greatest source of inspiration.When a situation you dying,survival instinct will press a incredible strength to create miracle.
 Humanity selfish.Dr.Brand never expecting to save Earth peoples.Dr Mann don't wanna death lonely in the desolate plant.
