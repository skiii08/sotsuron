Blade Runner 2049," WHAT made BLADE RUNNER 2049 OUTSTANDING is WHAT makes human TERRIFIED OF REPLICANTS
","Blade Runner 2049, a sequel having been expected for over 30 years, introduced a new thought for the old question, 'what defines a man?', which made this movie single out in its counterparts.This new thought is 'the ability of sexual reproduction', yet before discussing it, I would prefer questioning ourselves first, 'what makes replicants so terrifying.'If a technology allows us modifying or customizing a physical body, rather more, memories and personalities, in somehow way, it also enables us to perfectly copy a naturally-born man. Being copied is the most terrifying part in any biological replication issue because it straightly threatens a cognition being long engraved in humanity, 'I am unique.' The uniqueness in each individual has been proved in today's science and in our genes. Remind you, even though twins resemble in appearance, inside they still differ from genes. Besides, considering ourselves unique does reinforce our mental strength and even becomes an inseparable and key ingredient to shape a man. To put it briefly, uniqueness is one of the elements that define a man, and the emergence of replicants can easily topple and break this belief.However, we could still console our hearts with a somehow kind of excuse, 'Being designed and made in the lab doesn't give uniqueness.' This is certainly not only an excuse but a bloodily fact for replicants. They are controlled by naturally-born men's will, which is against an imperative component of uniqueness, randomness, yet this problem will be solved if replicants are able to reproduce themselves by human-like sex which is also called 'sexual reproduction', a new challenge brought in the old question by this movie. Sexual reproduction coincides with the variety of inheritance, in other words, with the randomness; therefore, naturally-born men tell no more difference from replicants' children, and this comes to a paradox: if they are the same, why should they be distinguished in two categories? Wait a moment, are they really same? In the film, replicants are built to have superior physical strength to naturally-born human's. Furthermore, what really matters is being same doesn't guarantee getting together in harmony. Remember the lesson history has taught us, we fight not with the different species but with anyone who jeopardizes the benefits. Combined with the two reasons, if naturally-born men wage a war to replicants and their generations, little can the men win it, which in likelihood the men lose the title, 'the king of species'. Hence, the only way to prevent this situation is to prohibit them to reproduce, to seal any information about replicants' ability to get pregnant, to keep order, the quote from Lieutenant Joshi, played by Robin Wright.Blade Runner 2049 not only raises the old question but arouses more like 'what is order?', 'what is morality?', or 'who decides what defies order and morality?' These questions are corollaries because asking 'what defines a man?' at the same time asks 'what does not define a man?' ; therefore, it comes plentiful cases waiting to defy and subvert the knowledge we have now. Deeper you get in this film, bigger you discover. However, if you don't want to get these things bothered, just relax and appreciate scenes and sounds!",9,4,11,28 February 2018
Taxi Driver," How a IGNORANT MAN turned into a MAD ONE!!
","Honestly, at first, by no means did I like the character, Travis, starred by Robert De Niro. His ignorance totally made him nothing but a hippie full of stupidity and embarrassment. Neither his dating with Betsy nor his habitual pause with that silly smile could I tolerate for any more in the scene, yet this proves that Robert De Niro did make a great job on the acting. HOWEVER, at the last scene when Travis leaving a cold and numb 'goodbye' to Betsy without taking the fee for driving, I found Travis my favorite character in the film. Travis is a sarcastic admonishment for modern people who seemingly aren't ignorant, and makes this movie an art of sarcasm. Travis was credited as a hero for saving Iris from a prostitute because of his strong intolerance of 'the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit', so he 'stood up'. Compared with Palantine, as a symbol of most modern people, all his actions remain watchwords, slogans, and in speeches. All we modern people care about is where the stress should be put in the sentence, 'We are the people', leaving the true problem gradually turning an ignorant and innocent man into a mad one. Finally this madman committed a serious crime which is so called 'a hero act' to modern people. See, how sarcastic is this? We all have madness to these problems, yet we hide it instead and presume on some guy like Travis to stand out. In my perspective, what Travis has done and become aren't hero things but nothing more than what a morbid society forces him to do. He brutally killed three men in a federal society and is crowned as a hero. See how mad this society is to the useless politicians. Taxi Driver and taxi drivers, these ignorant people, are both reminders for we modern people not to just maintain the situation but to reform and reinforce it.",8,0,0,25 February 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Space Odyssey is actually A Life Journey - Death orients us to find itself!
","Stanley Kubrick, a master of hiding metaphor in scenes and manipulating ambient musics, once again, hits the movie industry and sets a milestone in movie history. Though 2001 tells a slow story, in contrast, it gives us more time and breath to savor the scene and its meaning hid inside.The most pondering metaphor, out of question, is an alien black monolith in tombstone-like shape which is also the reason why the odyssey is commenced. Than I realize the odyssey is actually a human's life journey! Death, represented by the monolith, orients us to find death itself!Let's simply call the monolith, 'the stone'. First, the tombstone-like shape apparently implies the death, yet 2001 doesn't just conclude on it. In the film, the stone first appeared in Cenozoic period when apes, our ancestors, live. Upon the stone emerging, the apes, being startled at first, start caressing it. This means if a new species evolves, death, indeed, befall it, including human, and that every species holds death in awe. Than the second appearance of the stone is found on the moon, which is also classified. People know nothing about it except its radioactive emission aiming at Jupiter. Hence, the stone guides a crew of five people toward Jupiter to find the answer or more clues. However, the stone on the moon is classified, the crew doesn't know anything but only hears of something. Finally, Dr. Dave, one of the crew, learns the whole thing from a video while in the logic center of Hal which is an A.I. computer. What's under the stone on the moon is, instead of a corpse, an unconfirmed life waiting to be awakened! After learning it, Dave keeps flying toward Jupiter and suddenly gets himself in a time-and-space travelling which stops in a tidy and fancy room. He is stuck in the room, leaving himself getting older and older. Finally when he is struggling to hold the last breathe, the stone shows up in the room. Dave dies and a new life is awakened.Life journey starts from birth and ends in death because we consider life linear. However, what if life is actually cyclic? Than there's no more need to separate birth and death! Hence, in this cyclic life journey, not only do we gradually step toward death, but it is also death that sets us to find itself! Just like the stone which Dave starts and ends! And as we continuously pass through 'this death point', we are dead and born, again and again.2001 is not only a space odyssey but also a journey of life! Both of them are cyclic and endlessly circulate. These rules apply both on the biggest universe and on the smallest human's life!",9,2,4,4 July 2018
