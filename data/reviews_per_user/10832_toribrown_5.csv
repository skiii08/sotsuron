Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca was directed by Michael Curtiz and released in 1942. The film, starring Ingrid Bergan and Humphrey Bogart, is one of the all-time classic movies. The themes in Casablanca include love, loyalty and sacrifice. Ilsa is a married woman who learns that her husband has been killed in the war. She meets Rick in Paris, and the two fall in love. As they are about to leave Paris to avoid the Nazi's, she learns her husband is alive. Torn between her love for the two men, she learns that her husband needs her, and decides to remain loyal to him. However, she does not tell Rick, but just leaves instead, for she feared he would be not leave Paris and be captured. Time passes, and their paths cross again. This time, it is Rick that sacrifices his feelings for her, in an honorable and noble gesture. The film is realistic in what happens in the storyline. During wartime, many men were said to have died, only to find out it was mistaken identity. For the time period the movie was filmed, Ilsa's decisions may have been very common. The lighting and camera angles in some of the scenes, as well as some of the classic writing/quotes, has made the scenes memorable. The scene where Rick was in despair sitting in the dark, soft highlight lighting was used, making showing how distraught he was. This was the scene of his famous line, 'Of all the gin joints into the world, she walks into mine.' The final scene is one of the most famous scenes from a movie. It shows the love, the loss and sacrifice. The scene was shot with fog and dreariness. The playing of the theme song as the two interact the close-up shots with a soft focus of the camera add to the scene.",Null,0,1,11 March 2010
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","Citizen Kane is a millionaire newspaper owner and one of the richest and most powerful men in the world. On his dying lips, his only words were 'Rosebud'. The film opens with his death, and the audience is then brought on a journey through Kane's life. A reporter is assigned to figure out who or what Rosebud is. Kane is an individual that is willing to give up relationships to gain wealth, yet also seems caring and wanting to do what is right for people.Right from the opening scene, I thought lighting, use of shadows, camera angles and cinematography played a huge role in the movie. The dramatic building of the opening where the cameras pan slowly up the chain link fence, to the next fence area, to the wrought iron fencing, to see a glimpse of Xanadu, Kane's castle, to his lips speaking 'Rosebud', the tumbling and smashing of the snow globe, was an interesting sequence. I thought the ending shots were symbolic of the Thompson's (the reporter) statement, 'Rosebud is like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle.' The camera panned an aerial view from what almost looked like a cityscape, it slowly brings the audience down to an item which is thrown into the incinerator. Finally, the camera pans down the chain link fence from the beginning of the movie going full circle. The use of lighting and shadows as Kane is arguing with Susan makes him appear vulnerable, almost in desperate.",Null,0,1,11 May 2010
The Birth of a Nation," Birth of a Nation
","Believed to be single most important and key film of all time in American movie history, Birth of a Nation was introduced in 1915. It contained new camera techniques to be utilized in films. It used deep focus, jump cut and close-ups. As a matter of fact, D.W. Griffith, the filmmaker, used close-ups quite a bit in his films. The film also has new innovations and technical effects that are notable, including the color sequence at the end of the film. It uses panning and moving camera shots, high angle shots and outdoor landscapes.It was a film broken up into two parts, before the Civil War in America and the Reconstruction after the war. It covers themes of the Civil War, Interracial romance (Griffith also used interracial romance as a theme in Broken Blossoms), this time being between blacks and whites, and the creation of the Ku Klux Klan. Relationships are also a theme, that things are done properly, much like one expects in the 'proper South'. Relationships develop in a slow process, such as the one of Ben and Elsie. It takes over a couple years for the two to be together. The film can also be considered racist, as the blacks are portrayed negatively. The men are seen being forceful after white women, and men in the legislature are seen acting less than respectful in a formal meeting.",Null,1,2,11 May 2010
Fargo," Fargo
","Directed by Joel and Francis Coen, Fargo was released in 1996. Set in Fargo, North Dakota, it star William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard. Jerry arranges to have his wife kidnapped so his father-in-law will pay the ransom. This is definitely not my type of movie, but it was well done. There were some graphic bloody scenes that are stomach churning. The acting by Macy, Frances McDormand as the police officer and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare were very well done. The setting of the movie is a perfect setting for the cold-blooded killings that happened. The movie has what I would call expected gore. For example, as McDormand was creeping up in the woods behind the house and heard the wood chipper going, I wasn't surprised to see the foot sticking out of the chipper (though incredibly gross by the thought of it!). I really enjoy Steve Buscemi and how he added a bit of sarcastic humor, even though he is a criminal.",Null,0,0,11 May 2010
The Graduate," The Graduate
","The Graduate was directed by Mike Nichols in 1967. It wasn't necessarily my favorite movie. However, the Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross were very convincing in their roles. The setting and locations were pretty diverse. One of the main issues in the movie was the affair of Ben (Hoffman) and Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft). He was in love with her daughter, she was old enough to be his mother. I thought the 'intro' scene of the affair when Mrs. Robinson had Ben come to the house while she tried to seduce him had a very unique shot. She was positioned in a way where her legs were propped up, and he could be seen in a shot through her legs fending off her verbal advances. I felt the characters portrayed a realistic storyline. The scene where he raced to the wedding to stop Elaine from getting married was well done. Mrs. Robinson was determined to stop them from being together. He was determined for he and Elaine to be together. Bancroft played a very cool and controlled character. I thought her demeanor as she was sitting in the church was as though, 'I have succeeded and won keeping them apart.' The final scene of Ben desperately trying to stop the wedding and the camera angles of Elaine's mother, father and 'husband' added a bit of humor to the activity that was leading up. In a very brief moment, we go from seeing desperate Ben pounding on the windows, to a quick fight scene of Ben and Elaine running off and blocking everyone inside the church using the cross as a barrier and then the two of them running off to hop on the bus.",Null,0,0,10 May 2010
