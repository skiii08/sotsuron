The Blair Witch Project," A fine film, but not scary
","This film is unique. It has a wonderful realism caused by fine acting and the filming style (everything is filmed by the actors using two cameras in a documentary style) There are no special effects of any sort. It is quite spectacular to have a film with such an openness that requires raw talent in this age. The acting is flawless: the actors come off completely naturally. However, the only way I could find myself getting scared was if I tried to imagine it actually WAS real. That way, the noises in the night (literally) could be genuinely invasive and haunting. Yet, because I never saw anything, or heard anything apart from the screams from Josh, it was difficult for me to feel any terror. The figures and rocks that appeared out of nowhere in the mornings were a fantastic idea and, again, the reaction from the actors is flawless. Personally, because there were no actual jump scares or any recorded contact with the Witch for that matter, I didn't find it scary. It places ideas in the mind and leaves a lot to the imagination; I found that I needed more. This film simply is not for me regarding scare-factor, because of it's nature. That does not mean I cannot respect it's value and necessity in the world of film.",6,0,0,11 November 2017
