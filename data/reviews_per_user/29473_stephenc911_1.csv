Mission: Impossible III," a good summer starter flick
","MI3 fits the bill as a summer starter flickÂ—a good balance of unbelievable action + scenery from three continents + a love story. There's something for everyone, while not too much of any one thing to make it tacky.Watching the trailers did pump me up for this film, and it was quite cool to be reminded of how much I liked the old TV series.This one is certainly better than the first and second films, and you won't feel ripped off after watching it.In my opinion, worth a 7 out of 10. Buy a popcorn and a drink, because this film's over two hours long.",7,3,6,3 May 2006
