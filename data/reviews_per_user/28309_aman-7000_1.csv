Skyfall," Not the Bond 007 anymore
","This movie is hardly a James Bond movie. Reduced to the level of an action movie. With no story, holes in the meager story, no gadgets, no spy thing, no substantial Villain. It was brought down to the level of a Brainless Action, when James Bond decides to take on the enemy in a non tech. manner as he is no good with technology. In a nutshell this is nothing like what we expect from a James Bond movie.Those who may have rated it better may be fond of Action Movies with no IQ.",4,14,28,18 November 2012
