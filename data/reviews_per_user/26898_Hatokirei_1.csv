The Expendables 2," Get what ya expect
","I really enjoyed this movie. For me it's easily better then the first in that there is more action more explosions and better banter. Granted I'm probably one of the few women out there that gets their kicks out of over the top action movies and this one certainly fits the bill. Don't expect there to be too much depth to it, I mean come on....it's a crap ton of actors whose main claim to fame have been kicking, punching and shooting everyone who tries to fight them. If you go in expecting something other then what it OBVIOUSLY advertises itself to be then you may be disappointed. It's mainly rated for blood and violence, lots of heads being shot off or holes being shot through the chests, it's honestly pretty laughable but in a good way. Basically if you want a movie with deep substance....watch something else, this is all explosions, all macho men strutting around and all banter with lots of fun and cheesy references to any actors previous movies.",8,2,3,3 March 2013
