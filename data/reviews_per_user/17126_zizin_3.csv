Men in Black 3," Perfect trilogy
",My reaction is Watch this movie you won't be disappointed And Josh Brolin did a good job on past Kay The villain is awesome as fudge The setup is more awesome than the second movie. But the good thing is not the worst sequel and the special effects is still top notch And the guys who hate this movie they did not watch the series and the comic,10,0,4,4 August 2017
Men in Black II," OK silly but better
",OK this movie is so perfect It has the silly stuff from the comic book And the characters are more interesting than usual I love the Michael Jackson cameo The villain is so unexplained creepy and random type like the comic Don't listen to the haters they did not enjoy because they didn't read the comic book,10,1,3,4 August 2017
Men in Black," Best science fiction comic book adaptation
",I admired the comic first. But why Will Smith is the blonde guy well I'm racial correct he was fun in the movie. Will Smith he was better than the blonde guy of the comic book But the villain is awesome and the characters are very awesome Every special effects are top notch. And best Tommy lee Jones performance than stupid two face,10,0,0,4 August 2017
