Come and See," One of the most powerful war films ever.
",Come and See is one of the most powerful war films of all time. Between the cinematography and sound design this movie takes you for an unrelenting journey and doesn't let go. The main character is thrust into war for the Russians where he quickly learns the destruction and real horror of war. The beauty of this film is in its completely realistic approach. You lose grasp of you're reality and plunge yourself into this film. Once the chaos begins in this film it never lets you go. The viewer is put into a hypnosis or dream and there is no way out. To me this movie is one of the most powerful war films because of it's message. It doesn't glorify war at all. It brings war down to it's grittiest and most gruesome it could ever be. This movie made me feel the pain of these people engaged in this war. It made me feel anger that people brought this type of horror and destruction to humanity. I was engaged with every feeling the lead character went through. All in all it was an amazing experience. My favorite war film of all time.,10,1,1,9 December 2011
The Battle of Algiers," Battle of Algiers
",This is a very powerful film that basically is asking how far will you go to fight back against you're oppressor and how will you do it. This film is so powerful because we see the view of both sides. We see the French side of the army taking over these people and we see the Algerians side and them doing whatever they can to survive. Neither of them is good or bad. They both commit horrible acts on each other and never seem to fins a peace until after the story of the film is over. This film just makes you feel for the Algerians so much that you can't help be on their side but they go about their objective the wrong way sometimes. You attain so much respect for them though for fighting back as they do. In the end their whole purpose was to get their whole community to fight back and they finally did. Instead of bombing and killing they come together and march on the French. The film is all about the power of resistance and how far you can take it.,10,0,1,13 June 2011
