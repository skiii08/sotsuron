Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome!!
","Well now, another simply amazing movie from the mind of George Lucas.  I'm just trying to figure out where he gets it from.  His plot twists and character connections are amazing.  He seems to cover anything, no matter how small.Episode I carries on the story of the Star Wars universe.  It deals with the life of young Anakin Skywalker.  For those of you not familiar with the Star Wars universe, Anakin Skywalker grows up to be Darth Vador, who is the villain in Episode IV-VI.This movie had a great story line.  The only downside to the movie is the bumbling Jar-Jar Binks.  He is used as the Comedy relief.  I must say, he serves his purpose well, but we could have done without him.  He is just, well, stupid!What can I say, Darth Maul was simply Awesome.  If you ask me, Episode I should have revolved more around him.  But he was my favorite character from Epi. I.  Even though he didn't have much screen time, the time he has was used well.Oh well, over all the movie was rather good.  I must say that I anticipate the upcoming Episode II.  I can't wait to see what will happen to young Anakin.  I give Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace a big 10/10.Thank you for your time..",Null,0,0,7 August 2000
X-Men," Excellent! Really lives up to what is to be expected!
","X-men was a rather excellent movie.  It was all that I expected it to be and I was rather pleased.  Some may say that the character development was low, and I must agree.  But, they pulled it off.  I believe a person going to the movie who doesn't know the first thing about X-men will come out with a rather good understanding.First of all, I would like to say, that the choosing of Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier was about the best thing they could do.  He fits the criteria for the Prof. to a 't'.At first i had my doubts about the abilities of the other unknown characters, but after seeing the movie I realized that actors/actresses have to have a start somewhere.  Well, I must say, these people started out with a bang.Hugh Jackman was simply awesome.  His portrayal of Wolverine was beyond comparison.  But, I must add, my comments may be one-sided due to the fact that Wolverine is my favorite of the X-Men.I am a diehard Star Wars fan, but I had to rate this as a 10 because it is simply and excellent movie. If you haven't seen it yet, then I say make this your next movie.  You won't be disappointed.Thank you for your time...-T-",10,0,0,21 July 2000
