Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," one of the worst movies ever made
",this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen ....i don't know what's the point of making such a movie.! i don't understand what's funny about making fun of a country just because the American people don't know enough about it... i don't know muck about Kazakhstan but there are some points i am sure about: -they don't f**k their sisters -they have no habit of raping women -they have seen TV's before -they know cars - and one of the things i couldn't understand at all is the very high rating of this movie why does the Americans see their selves better than the people of Kazakhstan? they are human beings for god's sake!!!,4,5,10,14 January 2007
