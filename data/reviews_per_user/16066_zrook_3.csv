Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Speechless.
","Walked out after about 1/3 out of boredom and annoyance.Not my type of humor, and not worthy of the high ranking right now. Once the hype passes, it will be seen for what it is, and, hopefully, quickly forgotten.There is no plot to speak of. The 'humor' was low brow, crude, gross, supposedly trying to poke fun at the US while trying be a commentary about it at the same time.Personally I think it's just a waste of perfectly good film (and 10 bucks).Then again my gf--with whom I go very well along--absolutely loved it and keeps ranting about it. So did the rest of the theatre.Guess I need a new gf. All this goes to show that humor is really subjective, and that I'm old, very old.",1,21,45,9 November 2006
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Slow and boring. Only for fans.
","This movie is awful.I went to see this movie because I liked past performances of Depp and I like the way Burton works, but this was a waste of time and money.To begin with, with few exceptions the actors can't sing. A lot of singers can't act, and the opposite is true as well. Depp should absolutely stick to speaking.Then they keep on singing the same lines. Over and over and over. They could have put a few more dialogues, soliloquies, or even more sung lines in the story, but instead they opted for boring people.The story itself could have been good, except that the plot is flat and predictable, dragged on by the incessant monotone singing. Every major plot point, including the final 'twist' was so overdone that my fianc√©e guessed it about 15 minutes into the movie. This movie could have been done SO much better with a more convoluted plot.In truth, there are no twists, no poignant moments, no deep characters, and no story.Fans of the actors and of the director will love it for sure, but then again they are fans and that's what they do.",1,36,67,8 April 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Shaky camera absolutely ruined a good movie.
","When several people left the movie around the second severely shaky scene, I should've taken the hint. But I really wanted to see this movie, I wanted to like it. This is not the first nor the last movie to make use of the 'reality TV' type of angle, but, sincerely, other than annoying those who shell out the dough to see these seasickness-inducing flicks, what's the use?A limited version of this technique would be passable, even entertaining, but since in this movie the least they did was to always giggle the camera, and during the most interesting scenes they flailed the camera around like it was a tennis racket, they managed to ruin a movie I waited for a long time to see.I hope the DVD version contains less shaking.",1,6,22,4 July 2005
