Spartacus," Ranks with Ben Hur among the greatest biblical epics.
","With Ben Hur, one of the two greatest biblical epics ever. Douglas is at his peak as the hero. The other stars- Simmons, Olivier, Curtis, Laughton and Ustinov are perfect in their roles. Simmons is absolutely gorgeous. Also, look for John Gavin( as Caesar) and John Ireland in key roles. One of the rare movies where Olivier did not get top billing. I will always remember two lines at the end: Olivier-' They will fight here now, for me, and the winner will be crucified.' Douglas-' He'll come back, and he'll be millions.' Ustinov won Best Supporting Actor.",10,2,6,26 December 1998
12 Angry Men," The greatest movie I have ever seen.
",One of the all time greats. The cast is incredible. Everyone has a unique personality. My favorite is Lee J. Cobb. ' Rotten kids- you work your life out.' The dynamic between certain of the actors is great. Edward Binns to Lee J. Cobb: Why are you talking like that to him for? Man talks like that to an old man really ought to get stepped on. You ought to have more respect mister. You say stuff like that to him again; I'm gonna lay you out.' I own the video and have watched the movie dozens of times. The remake in 1997 pales by comparison.,10,1,2,19 December 1998
The Aviator," Disappointing
","The story was interesting and the cinematography was excellent. Scorcese did a good job of accurately relating many of the events of Hughes' life. My disappointment was in the casting. DiCaprio looked and acted juvenile. I thought I was watching Titanic again. Hughes was 6'4'' and rangy. Leo looked nothing like Hughes. I felt he looked like a little boy, and sounded like a young Tom Cruise. He looks less than his age anyway, and he certainly didn't look anything close to the 41 that Hughes was in 1947. He tried hard, but was just miscast. Cate Blanchett gave her all as Hepburn, but in my view, was over the top. Jude Law looked little like the tall and powerful Flynn, and his accent was extreme. Gwen Stefani, at 35, looked her age and certainly nothing like Jean Harlow in her early 20s. I thought Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin were OK in their supporting parts.",5,3,6,27 January 2005
Casino," A great gangster movie in the Goodfellas/Godfather tradition
","Very violent, but also very entertaining. Pesci, DeNiro, and Stone are great-also the supporting players- especially Rickles and Vincent. Pesci is the great little tough guy of our generation. The movie is certainly a drama, but there are also many comic components. I like the continuing interplay across several movies between Pesci and Frank Vincent. In Raging Bull, Pesci attacks Vincent. In Goodfellas, Pesci kills Vincent and buries him. In Casino, at the end, Vincent kills Pesci with a baseball bat and then 'ships' and buries him. I believe most people like the violence- they just don't want to admit it.",10,1,1,22 January 1999
