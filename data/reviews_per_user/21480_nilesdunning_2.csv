The Hangover," very typical white writers
","did not find it hysterical to see the typical negative hurtful portrayals of black, Asian, native-American, etc. spending millions of dollars on creating these destructive images. there are a lot of great movies. i only take the time to respond to ones that are hurtful. spending money - one hopes to have a good fun movie experience. everyone should be able to take a joke. but this is yet another example of insensitive ignorant group of white guys doing their 'thing'. you should have a warning label: if you're not of a specific demographic and don't have a specific set of core values: than don't see this movie. that would have been helpful. however, it seems that a little more these days, a few are excerising some conscience. these very typical white writers and director are not one of them.",1,6,13,13 January 2010
The Thin Red Line," get over it people
","Please do not disregard this post. For I am entitled to my opinion.Malick is obsessed with the white male as lord over it's dominion - the entire world and all of it's brown skinned inhabitants. Here we 'poetically' follow a path of rustling nature and wheat grass which ultimately leads to a band of grossly portrayed, disgusting and idiotic Japanese soldiers. This is thoroughly and utterly juxtaposed against the imagery of beautiful white US soldiers. (In the New World he sets his multi-million dollar movie making propaganda machine on full throttle once again).I did not find The Thin Red Line to be majestic, sweeping, or poetic. Ironically, it tried sooo hard to be that - that - any suspension of disbelief backfired - and it only made me conscious of the filmmakers themselves.The film's pov is so utterly one-sided, it made me sick. In life there is 3 sides to EVERY story. Side A, Side B... and then there is THE TRUTH. THE REAL TRUTH.",1,5,10,18 January 2010
