The Avengers," Very Impressive And Well Worth The Wait
","It has been a long time since I've anticipated a summer movie season as much as I've anticipated 2012's. And what better way to kick it off than with one of the most anticipated movies of...well if not the decade, then at least the last 5 years. The Avengers was a very impressive accomplishment by Joss Whedon, and it was well worth the wait. This is one of those movies that had its work cut out for it for quite some time. This was going to take some skill as a movie-maker. How in the world would anyone be able to bring all of these larger-than-life characters together in such a way that it would not seem too jammed packed and jumbled up for its own good? How would all of these heroes be showcased in a movie that is almost all main-character and lead actor? And to answer those questions, all I can really say is this: I don't know. And after seeing the movie, I still don't know. All I know is that it was done, and it was done very well. I have to admit, when I found out Whedon was going to be at the helm for this one, I had some doubts (which, I'll admit were only based on my lack of attention to most of his work as a writer). However, after seeing Cabin In The Woods a few weeks ago, I saw what Whedon was able to accomplish with what was, technically a film that goes into the horror genre, but really was one of the best and unique films I've seen in a long time. And even though he was only a script writer for Cabin, anyone who knows anything at all about screenplays knows that that was one that was penned by a very talented and creative guy. So at that point I was more than convinced that he could pull off something great with The Avengers, and after seeing it tonight, it's safe to say that Whedon was certainly quite up for this task. If you love movies then go see this one. It has the action, it has the acting, and more than anything (and is so important when it comes to a film like this) it has the story and script. This is the quintessential summer movie that everyone hopes for. But, and this is the good part, it's also got so much more that makes it so much more than the quintessential summer movie. So, the summer movie season has officially arrived. And now, the rest of the season has its work cut out for it.",8,4,9,4 May 2012
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Guess I was just in the mood
","Maybe it was because I had a hard week at work.  Maybe it was because I just needed something to make me feel good.  I don't know.  I can't pinpoint it, but for some reason I really liked this movie.  Sure it was manipulative, and sure it tried it's best to make you feel all mushy inside, but you know what...I guess I was just in the mood for that, and this movie hit the spot last Friday night.  From a cinematography stand point the movie is beautiful.  Redford is known for this trait, and indeed has directed some of the most beautiful movies ever made (A River Runs Through It, The Milagro Beanfield War, The Horse Whisperer).  He just chooses some very beautiful scenery and runs with it.  However, besides the scenery, the movie seemed to flow like a steady river.  The acting was superb (even Smith's subdued Bagger), and the story was interesting.  I like golf, so maybe that helped, but I do think that anyone can enjoy this movie.  You just have to let yourself like it.",8,58,75,8 November 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Powerful And Heartbreaking
","I just finished watching Darren Aronofsky's Requiem For A Dream. I don't know why it has taken this long for me to see it. It just has. And now that's it's over, I feel like I just got punched in the face. Maybe even kicked there too. Now I'll admit it. I like the Academy Awards. I do. They may get things wrong often. But if I'm being honest, they get many things right too. However, every now and then they make a mistake that is so egregious, there's no justification for it. And not, at the very least, nominating Requiem for best picture is one of those inexcusable mistakes. Don't get me wrong. I liked Gladiator. In fact, Gladiator (which won best picture for 2000) is a film that exceeded my expectations. There was far more depth found within it than I could have imagined. But when we're talking about the realm of overall societal and cultural relevance and importance, Gladiator does not hold a candle to Requiem...plain and simple. All too often, films get labeled 'important' just for being edgy and willing to test the boundaries of a difficult subject matter. Well Requiem doesn't just test the boundaries when it comes to portraying the destructiveness of drug addiction, it obliterates them. This really is one of the most important films ever made. Aronofsky pulls no punches here. He is determined, with this film, to lay bare any and all deceptions that are attached to drugs. And he exposes them for what they really are. Slow, painful, and methodical killers. The downward spiral that is exhibited by the characters is both heartbreaking and disturbing. And the acting is phenomenal. There's no doubt that Ellen Burstyn deserved her Oscar nomination. Her performance was just about as realistic as it gets. But I think other nods could have been given as well, especially in regards to Jennifer Connelly. I really don't even have words to describe her performance except to say that it was mesmerizing. I can't imagine how difficult it had to have been for her to prepare for this role. The content is raw and uncompromising. And to be completely honest, some of the scenes are difficult to watch. However, in the end it is the message that rings loud and clear. It is the message that trumps everything else. And it's the message that maybe, just maybe will make someone who is thinking about dabbling in drugs change his or her mind.",9,1,1,7 September 2010
Se7en," extremely disturbing film
","Seven is one of the most disturbing films ever to come to the screen. This is one of those movies that will get under your skin, and stay with you for a long time. I appreciate this movie not because I am preoccupied with death, or horrific murder scenes...on the contrary, death and murder scare me, and so I would hope a film that portrays these things would do so in a very frightening way. Seven does. Indeed, this is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. I only recommend this one to people who can stomach very dark, and painfully realistic movies. If you do want to see it, be warned that it does contain some of the most disturbing murder scenes I have ever witnessed on film, and the ending will haunt you long after the film is over. However, the realness...the idea that in life there aren't always happy endings, shines through in Seven. If that is the kind of movie you like, or think you can appreciate, then by all means, see Seven.",9,0,0,27 January 1999
Shakespeare in Love," imaginative and good
","This was certainly one of the most imaginative movies of the year and it was pretty good.  The idea was definitely unique, and it was a thoughtful portrayal of something that didn't happen, at least not to anyone's knowledge.  By bringing Will Shakespeare down to the same level as any modern day young person who is struggling with love, this film has helped us understand Shakespeare as a person, and not just a poet and writer of plays who used words like thou, wilt, and shalt.  It might not have been an accurate story, but it was not meant to be.  And if it helps boost an interest in Shakespeare that might not have been there before for some people, then perhaps it has done some good.  I did think that the movie could have targeted a larger audience by leaving out some unnecessary nudity.  Without the nudity I believe the love scenes would have still had the same effect, and the movie could have garnered a PG-13 rating, boosting audience potential.  Just my opinion.",7,0,0,16 March 1999
Argo," It's Time Affleck Gets The Attention He Deserves
","It's not an accident. There's a reason that Ben Affleck continues to shine as a filmmaker. As an old professor of mine once said, 'Consistency will expose you...either for good, or for ill.' And consistency has exposed Affleck as one heck of a filmmaker. He has now directed three films, and every one of them have been tremendous. First there was Gone Baby Gone, a film that was at the top of my list of best movies of 2007. Then there was The Town. Now, even though I didn't think that The Town reached quite as high as GBG, the difference between them was negligible at best. It's like saying which one is better: A million dollars or $950,000? Obviously a million's better, but I'd take the 950 Gs in a heartbeat. And now we have Argo. For me, so far, this is hands down the best movie of this year. Now that might change over the next 6 weeks or so, but I don't see that happening. Once again, Affleck directs in a way that makes it very evident that he has complete control over every detail of a film. I mentioned this in my review of The Town, but I'm going to mention it again. There are very few directors who can achieve that type of meticulous control, and still deliver an almost perfect product. And make no mistake about it...this movie is darn near perfect. Especially considering the fact that I knew how everything was going to turn out, and yet towards the conclusion of the film, I was on the edge of my seat. And so it's time now. It's time that Affleck gets the attention that he deserved to get with Gone Baby Gone, and The Town. And the attention better come in the form of two Academy Award nominations: One for Best Picture, and one for Best Director. If it doesn't happen this time around, then the Oscars will have comprehensively, and epically failed to accomplish their goal of nominating the very Best Pictures of the year. The only thing that I'm disappointed about, is the fact that we're probably going to have to wait two years or so before Affleck's next film. But I guess that's o.k. I'll just pass the time with a few more viewings of Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo when it comes out on Blu-Ray.",9,4,7,21 November 2012
Public Enemies," Not Great, Just Decent
","I should first say that Michael Mann is quite the master when it comes to shootouts. In Heat, he orchestrated what I consider to be one of the best gun battles ever filmed. And in Public Enemies, there's a pretty darn good one too, albeit, not as good as Heat's. Unfortunately, it was after the gun battle that Public Enemies went from being a great movie, to just a decent one. It's from that point on, that the slick cinematography, the good acting (which is mostly why I give the film a 7/10 instead of a 6/10), and the authentic look and feel seem to be great parts that, for some reason, don't add up to a great whole. I guess I'll blame it on the screenplay. The dialogue, at times, just doesn't seem believable after a while. I guess it was somewhere around the 1 hour and 45 minute mark that things started to drag a bit. It's then that Depp's Dillinger is, for all intents and purposes, on his own. It's then that there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot left to say. And it's from that point on that there were only glimpses of the brilliance that came before it. Indeed, I must admit that my mind wandered somewhat until the very end, where I was reeled back in for a pretty good, tense finish. Impressive, considering I knew what was to come. But also not enough. It was not enough to elevate this film back up into the ranks of some of the best gangster movies ever made.",7,16,30,1 July 2009
Once," Close to Perfect
","Who would have thought? Out of all of the movies to come out this summer, the one with the least amount of special effects (make that no special effects), the one with no A-list actors, the one with a director I, and I would venture to guess that many others had never heard of, would be the best movie of the summer, and quite possibly the whole year. I am not exaggerating. This is not hyperbole here. 'Once' is as about as close to perfect as you can get. The story is simple, and yet it is the simplicity that makes it so good. The actors actually seem like real people. This is the type of movie that almost anyone can relate to. All of us have had that one relationship in life, where if it had only been another place, or perhaps another time, things would have worked out perfectly. All of us have had those experiences in life where we know that we just had one of the best times of our lives, with someone that we really connected with, and yet we know that the time will not live on, and the person will go out of our lives just as quickly as they came in. 'Once' captures that realness almost perfectly. It is the type of movie that will make you feel better about people. And it may just make you feel better about yourself.",9,16,18,11 July 2007
The Town," Very Good...Affleck Continues To Shine Behind Camera
","The Town is one of the most solid efforts I've seen this year. For me, minus a couple exceptions, the 2010 summer movie season was one of the most disappointing I've experienced in quite some time. Never have I been more ready to welcome a Fall movie line-up than this year. And one of the first movies high on my list of must-sees was The Town. It did not disappoint. Is it too soon to declare that Ben Affleck has achieved movie director greatness? Perhaps. But if he continues to churn out material like Gone Baby Gone and The Town, it won't be long and he'll be considered one of the best directors in Hollywood. This was a movie that had it's work cut out for it. I was expecting great things. Gone Baby Gone was my favorite movie from 2007, and although The Town does not quite reach it's status, it is still a very good film. It is clear from the outset that Affleck has his finger on the pulse of his characters in a way that allows him to steer the trajectory of the film in a direction that satisfies the viewer in almost every way. Few directors are able to achieve that kind of control, and still deliver. And the screenplay is exceptional. There are at least five characters in this film that are fleshed out, and so well developed that we actually care about what happens to them. It's hard enough for most directors to develop one or two characters to that extent. And the acting from all involved is very good, with one exceptional performance from Jeremy Renner. No doubt he'll be up for another Oscar nomination this year. Everything about this film is so good. The cinematography, the musical score, the editing...literally every aspect. It's interesting. Thirteen years ago when I saw Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in Good Will Hunting, I never dreamed Affleck would be the one who would emerge from that solid effort as the more talented one in any aspect. Damon has proved himself the better actor. I don't think too many people would argue against that point. However, Affleck has proved to be better behind the camera. And in the long run, I think that's where he'll prove to be the one who makes the bigger, longer-lasting impact.",9,5,9,22 September 2010
Shutter Island," Well Done
","When it comes to directors who are of the caliber of Martin Scorsese, even when they're not producing their best stuff, it is still so much better than most everything else out there. That is the case with Scorsese's Shutter Island. This was not a perfect movie. Not by any means or stretch of the imagination. It was a bit long, and some of the material felt a little recycled. In fact, there's a sequence near the beginning of the film where it seems that Scorsese was borrowing a little too heavily from movies like The Shining or Psycho. However, this was still a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, and thoroughly entertained. And I have to say, Leonardo DiCaprio turned in one of his best performances to date. His reaction near the end of the movie when his character faces a reality that is absolutely horrifying, was both heartbreaking and genuinely moving. I have to admit, even I got a little choked up during that scene, and that is something that almost never happens. It's interesting. When Paramount pushed back Island's release date to February 2010, I got a little nervous. After all, this time of year is a notorious dumping ground for production companies' crap. However, the fact that it was Scorsese kept me interested. I don't know why Paramount pushed the release date back. And I really don't care. All I know, is I'm glad they did. It was nice to go to the movies in February and not feel like I was throwing my money down the drain.",8,4,8,22 February 2010
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," One Of The Most Monumentally Disappointing Films I Have Ever Seen
","What happened? How did we get to this point? And although I think Disney definitely had something to do with the problem, you can't put it all on Disney. There's plenty of blame to go around.Fans: We played a role here. And if you don't believe that, then you probably weren't an original fan. I mean a fan from all the way back to 1977 when this saga got its start. We bit*hed and moaned about the prequels (some of which was well earned). George Lucas became disillusioned and so he went and sold his epically original sci fi saga to Disney. He just didn't want to deal with it anymore. This led to Disney deciding to go ahead and make a final trilogy...something that so many of us fans had been looking forward to ever since our childhood when there was that tease of more episodes. Six more in fact. We never really knew if it was true. And if it was true, we didn't know when those other films would be made. Lucas gave us the prequels. And then Disney gave us the final trilogy. This should have been a dream come true. But it wasn't.Lucas: He makes this list by default. After all, if he hadn't sold his story to Disney then we wouldn't have had to endure VIII and IX (VII wasn't great, but it was a good set up for the last two films).Kathleen Kennedy: Don't need to say much here. We all know why part of this debacle is her fault.Rian Johnson: While I didn't hate VIII like many fans did, it wasn't even close to what was hoped for after seeing VII. Mark Hamill did a supberb job as the old, disillusioned Luke. But that's about all he was. I do give credit to Johnson for including the scene with Luke and Yoda. That was well done.JJ Abrams: Let's be honest, Abrams gave us a pretty good VII. But after things went awry with VIII, he had to focus on damage control. This severely limited his options for how to make IX the film we all hoped for. In some ways I think he did an admirable job considering the fact that he had to try and fix some storylines that Johnson included in VIII.SJWs: Oh yes. I don't care how much flack I get on this one. Politics entered into the final two episodes in a way that they never had before in the Star Wars universe. And so just about every politically liberal issue you can think of, made it into VIII and IX.Fans again: As disappointed as many of us were, we still forked out our money to see these movies. This especially applies to epidode IX, as it still made over a billion dollars worldwide, despite the fact that many of us had been warned about the possibility of IX royally sucking after some leaks all but assured us that we were not going to care for this film.Palpatine's Presence: This should never have happened. It was one of the worst decisions I have ever seen in a film. It made no sense for him to still be around, other than to be a gimmick that would be used to lure us all in. Including Palpatine in this film also polluted the Star Wars universe by making the end of Return Of The Jedi almost obsolete. I mean, I guess it really wasn't a victory at the end of VI, was it. Oh how stupid our characters were...hoodwinked by an old man who was thrown down a shaft that should have killed him. They even thought it killed him, but, alas, that was not the case. And one more thing.
When you take Luke's proclmation that 'No one's ever really gone,' and you couple that with the fact that Palpatine survived his plunge down a reactor shaft, one has to wonder: How do we know that Palpatine isn't still alive after the conclusion of episode IX? I mean, if he survived being thrown down the reactor shaft, and was seemingly blown to bits or vaporized...then surely he could survive being...well...whatever it was that Rey did to him. So the fact that JJ Abrams opened this can of worms by bringing Palpatine back, means Abrams has created a situation where fans and others will always have some degree of doubt regarding Palpatine being alive or dead. Because if he came back once, what's to stop him from doing it again.The end of IX: It sucked. It sucked hard. There were so many things that happened in the end, that, even in a movie that was nearly two and a half hours long...it all seemed rushed and sloppy.And so how monumentally disappointing for someone who had been a fan from day one. A fan who had always dreamed that the prequels and the final triology would get made some day. I had even thought about how, in the last three films, the original cast members could still be in it, if those last three films were supposed to take place thirty or so years after VI. All of those things came together. And yet it all added up to...well, not much. Not much at all. I kind of wish that these last three films would have continued to focus on the original characters only. There could have still been new characters. But, honestly, I don't know if even that would have worked. There is one thing that I never, ever thought I would say in a million years regarding Star Wars. If this was going to be the final result, then I wish these last three films would never have been made. But, as the old saying goes, hindsight is 20/20.",4,7,14,26 February 2020
Gone Baby Gone," Easily One Of The Five Best Of 2007
","The first question that has to be asked is this: How did this not get nominated for Best Picture? I have to say, rarely do movies ever affect me in such a way that they stay with me long after the credits have rolled. There have been very few. But Gone Baby Gone is one of those movies. It is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. The acting and directing are superb. Casey Affleck is quickly becoming one of the best young actors in Hollywood. He is very convincing as a 'no nonsense, doesn't take any crap off of anyone' person who will stop at nothing to get to the truth of the matter. And Ben Affleck just may have found out what it is he is destined to do. Although he is passable as an actor, his strength is clearly in screen writing and behind the camera. He has created what I consider to be an almost masterpiece here. The end of this film is the most bitter-sweet conclusion I have ever seen. The decision that Affleck's character is forced to make can all be boiled down to one word...integrity. He had it, and he made the decision that was right. There's a famous saying that rings true here: Most of the time the hard thing to do, and the right thing to do are the same. This movie hammers home that idea forcefully. And it's easily one of the five best movies of 2007.",9,3,6,8 April 2008
Warrior," One Of The Best This Year
","For me, Warrior was one of the best surprises of this entire year in film. It's not very often you find a movie that, in all actuality, was about as formulaic as you can get within the context of it's genre, and yet was still a very good film. There really isn't anything new that Warrior brings to the table as far as films about fighters are concerned, except it centers on Mixed Martial Arts instead of boxing. But it really doesn't matter because the story, screenplay, and acting make this one of the best movies I've seen in 2011. And no performance was more compelling than that of Nick Nolte's. I'm not really sure what's been going on with Nolte in the last few years or so, other than some minor film roles and some legal problems. But in Warrior, he delivers what may be the best performance of his career, and certainly a performance that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. I have a sneaky suspicion that some of the demons that haunt his character here hit a little too close to home for him. But it's also probably some of those negative experiences that helped him deliver such a mesmerizing performance. It should be noted that the film starts to drag just a bit in the second half. But all is forgiven in one of the best conclusions to a film I've seen in a very long time. If you're a little gun shy about this one because you may not be the biggest MMA fan in the world, don't let that keep you from seeing this film. Don't get me wrong. The MMA aspect is definitely on full display here. But it's what surrounds the fight scenes that makes Warrior a very satisfying movie. And it's what surrounds the fight scenes that also makes Warrior one of the best films of the year.",8,2,5,21 December 2011
Face_Off," I enjoyed this one
","Face Off was the best summer movie of 1997, hands down.  This was probably the first John Woo movie I had seen, and I must admit I wasn't quite ready for his powerfully charged way of bringing action to the screen (wasn't quite ready, but loved every minute of it).  Cage and Travolta were perfect in these roles, and they very convincingly played the two main characters well.  This must have been an opportunity of a life time...to be able to prove your ability and skill as an actor by playing the villain and the hero in the same movie.  Sure it has been done before, but not this uniquely.  I still can't get over one particular scene in the movie, a scene that was very powerful, and almost touching in a violent sort of way (if that is possible).  **could be viewed as minor spoiler** It involved Travolta playing the Troy character when he realized his brother had just been killed.  I still remember that police officer looking at Travolta thinking he was  Sean Archer, and saying rather coldly 'sir, it's only Pollux Troy.' Travolta, as Castor Troy then looked at him with a dead stare that would have sent chills through even the bravest person's bones, lifted his gun in one swift move, and put a bullet in the officer's head, killing him instantly.  I remember thinking 'boy that was brutal.'  But I also remember thinking 'I would probably have felt like doing the same thing to someone who had just insulted a recently deceased close family member of mine.' Grant it, Castor Troy was a nasty, rotten character, but for that one brief second, in his moment of grief, you could almost sympathize with him.  Very powerful stuff!  That much substance isn't really found in the rest of the movie, but it doesn't matter.  If you just take it for what it is, a high powered, well acted, action movie, then you will be satisfied.  But hey, that's just my opinion.",7,2,4,14 November 2001
American History X," Powerful
","American History X is certainly one of the most powerful movies I have seen in a long time. I just watched it last night on video, and let me tell you it is still with me, and will be for some time to come. Hatred is senseless. This is what I have come away with after seeing this one. What is so sad about American History X, is even though it is a fictional story, it portrays a very realistic problem in our world. It is amazing how one can become so engulfed in hate, that they fail to see how the hatred is destroying them and the people around them. We think that the consequence of Derek's actions is a prison sentence, and the result is a wonderful rehabilitation that is going to change not only his life, but his brother's too, who is headed down the same hate-filled road that Derek was headed down. However, we come to find that life doesn't work that way. Indeed, the hate filled seeds that Derek sowed before prison have blossomed, and the consequences are more then he could have ever imagined. American History X is a great movie because of how painfully real it is, and it doesn't pull any punches. It lets us know just how senseless hatred is...any kind of hate. You see, just because this movie happened to be about white supremacism, doesn't mean that it doesn't apply to everyone. I think the bottom line is this: Any hatred toward anyone can bring you down. It leads to emptiness, and destruction, and can bring about events that will ultimately kill you emotionally, and maybe even literally.",9,0,0,9 April 1999
District 9," Another One
","Earlier this year I saw Moon, and thought it was one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long time. I also thought that it would be a while before I saw another one just as good. I was wrong. District 9 is just as good, albeit very different. However, the two films did have a couple things in common. First, they are both very intelligently written. I have to admit, I wasn't taken in by D-9 right off the bat. Much of that had to do with the fact that this odd little character, Wikus Van De Merwe, seemed as if he was going to play a pivotal role, and initially, I just couldn't see that happening. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is one of the best developed characters I've seen in a movie. As another comment alluded to, the transformation that Wikus makes from the beginning of the film to the end is nothing short of astonishing. Sharlto Copley's performance is brilliant, and it is one that definitely needs to be remembered come awards time. And the movie itself is a pleasure to watch. It is thoroughly entertaining and it gives the audience what they came for, but so much more. We get big explosions. We get guts and gore. But we also get a powerful story of hope and redemption (as was the case in Moon). We also get a story that revolves around some very tough ethical concerns and questions (also, like Moon). And that's the type of depth I like to see in any movie, Sci-Fi or otherwise.",9,3,6,8 November 2009
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Very Good, Very Tarantino, And This Time That Made Perfect Sense
","In my review for Django Unchained I said that the ending of the movie was very Tarantino, and that that was part of the problem for that particular film. I also said, 'Tarantino got in the way of Tarantino,' in Django, or something to that effect. I won't go into detail here about what I meant by that statement. You can go read it if you really want to know. However, I only bring that up now, because I want to say the opposite here: For Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood, Tarantino ends the film in good ol' Tarantino style! And it fits perfectly here. He most certainly did not get in his own way here. About mid-way through OUATIH, I started to get the feeling that the audience was going to get a Tarantino version of a history lesson, much like they did in Inglorious Basterds (now don't get me wrong, this film is not as good as Basterds, but it is still pretty doggone good). Which is to say, not a history lesson at all. More like the version of things that many people would rather have seen play out in the pages of history. In Inglorious Basterds, Hitler receives the type of justice most of us would have preferred he received at the close of WWII. And here, the Manson clan that committed that unspeakable act of evil in August of 1969, gets their comeuppance in very Tarantino-like fashion. And that was exactly what, not only I was hoping for, but what everyone who I saw the film with was hoping for, as well. The only thing that could have made it any better, as far as I am concerned, would have been to have Manson, himself, meet the same type of fate some of his followers met at the conclusion of this film. But, that is a very small complaint in an otherwise very good movie.",8,0,1,23 November 2019
Django Unchained," Very Tarantino...And Yet This Time That Was Part Of The Problem
","Well I finally saw Django Unchained last night, and I've got some good things to say and some not so good things. First of all, I am a Tarantino fan...always have been ever since Reservoir Dogs. I know what to expect when it comes to his films. I expect a lot of blood, over the top violence, great dialogue, interesting characters, dark humor, and one heck of a story. And all of that was present in Django Unchained. So why do I feel like, somehow, Django missed the mark a bit. Well...and I never thought I'd ever say this about a Tarantino movie...I guess I wish he'd just restrained himself somewhat. For about 80% of DU, we have a masterpiece. At that point in the film I honestly felt that I may be watching Tarantino's best movie ever. And then something happened. Tarantino got in the way of Tarantino. And here's what I mean by that. 80% of DU is a classic buddy movie with some of the best interactions I've seen in quite sometime between characters. Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz (who, once again, gives the best performance in a Tarantino film) are brilliant. There was so much chemistry between them, that their growing friendship and partnership in the bounty hunter profession was the most authentic thing about the film. You honestly come to care for both of their characters. And don't get me wrong. There was plenty of ruthless bloodiness along the way, and as always, the violence was quite graphic. But then, with about a half hour, or so, to go in the movie Tarantino ratchets up the bloodiness to Kill Bill levels. Now, that type of exaggeration was fine in the Kill Bill movies. Heck, that type of exaggeration is fine in just about any Tarantino film except Django. Here I wish Tarantino would have pulled the reigns in. Because what was, up until that point one of the best movies I've seen in a while, just becomes more grind house, comic book-esque entertainment. Of all his films, this should have been the one where Tarantino said, 'This time I'm going to come at a film in a more serious manner.' The plot certainly lent itself to such seriousness. I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any bloody violence. On the contrary, and again because of the storyline, a lot of violence should have been expected. And it was there. But then Tarantino turns the knob up so high, that the full-blast nature of the carnage actually gets in the way of this otherwise brilliant film. Now...all of that being said, I still liked this movie. There are so many things to like about this movie. But the ending isn't really one of them. Too bad...because what came before the preposterous conclusion was so doggone good. But, as I've said before, that is just my opinion.",7,3,7,20 January 2013
Gran Torino," Not Eastwood's Best, But Still Pretty Darn Good
","Gran Torino is not Clint Eastwood's best movie. Not by a long shot. However, even when Eastwood is not quite on top of his game, the result is still pretty darn good. I didn't even mind the somewhat depressing ending, because...well, that's just Eastwood. No one tells a tragic tale better than him. And what occurs in this film is tragic. But there is a ray of hope found at the end of this story...the idea that sacrifice and honor will ultimately defeat suppression and hatred. Eastwood's Walt Kowalski is a crotchety old man, and an angry bigot. At times, it's even a little difficult to like the man. But, as the famous saying goes, 'you can't judge a book by it's cover.' And, in the end, when the time calls for Walt to make a decision that will ultimately bring about dire consequences for himself, but ensure the safety of others, he doesn't even think twice. This is vintage Eastwood. That's not to say that there weren't any problems with this film though. Actually there were quite a few. It did seem a bit long, and yet the running time was just a shade under two hours. Simply put, there were a few scenes that could have used some editing, or could have been cut out completely. An example would be when Walt takes young Thao to the barber shop. I know that this scene was supposed to help illustrate the friendship developing between Walt and Thao. However, I think the film had already established that fact by the time this scene rolled around, and thus it seemed a bit redundant and distracting. And I'm not surprised that this was the first acting experience for Ahney Her (Sue), and Bee Vang (Thao). While they did a passable job, it seemed like, at times, they were reading their lines from a cue card. Part of the wooden acting, however, may also have been the result of a screenplay that needed some work. But, even with all the weaknesses, this is still a pretty good film. I would even go so far as to say it's a must for Eastwood fans. And if, as some have suggested, this is his last film as far as acting is concerned, he goes out with a bang. Figuratively and literally.",7,2,6,7 February 2009
The Hurt Locker," Felt Almost Like A Documentary
","One word sums up this film: Real. This is, by far, one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen, and in that sense, it felt almost like a documentary. And that's a good thing. I've seen war movies before. Some good and some bad. I've seen war movies that have effectively tried to convey the way things really are, and have been successful in doing so. But this is the first time I've seen one that actually made me feel like I was there. From the very intense opening, Kathryn Bigelow grabs the audience and does not let them go. She beautifully and meticulously examines the complex realities of war, and she does it in two main ways. First, she does it by providing viewers with an up close and personal experience with combat. Second, and on a deeper level, she examines the effects that war can have on the psyche of a soldier. It's the latter that is the most heartbreaking. When Jeremy Renner's William James gets to go home for a period of time, we can see that he is not ready to be integrated back into society. The cereal isle scene in the super market is especially effective. For him, war has become, as the quote says, a drug. And he's not ready to come down from that high. This is a powerful motion picture, and one that will stay with me for some time to come.",8,15,24,25 July 2009
Meet Joe Black," I enjoyed this movie
","I saw Meet Joe Black last night, and I can say that for me, this was a very enjoying experience at the movies.  Movies like this are why I go to see movies.  It had everything you could want in a movie; it was a love story, a friendship story, and it teaches a very good lesson that we've all heard before, but need to be reminded of...the lesson that life is short, so you better enjoy it while you can, and never take for granted what you have and the people in your life who mean everything in the world to you.  Three hours is a long time, but I am not one who usually complains about length when it comes to a good movie, and this was a very good movie.",8,0,0,15 November 1998
Donnie Brasco," Should have been nominated
","Donnie Brasco was simply one of the best films of 1997 and should have been nominated for best picture.  Being released in February of that year didn't make it easy for the voters to remember it, but make no mistake, it was easily one of the five best movies of 1997.  The relationship that is portrayed between Donnie and Lefty is one of the most beautiful friendships ever constructed on screen (perhaps because it was taken from a true story), and the inevitable action that is taken by Donnie in the end is painfully sad.  Pacino and Depp have a chemistry that is magnificent and easily compares to some of the best pairings in cinematic history.  I only hope we'll be fortunate enough to see them again sometime in another movie. Donnie Brasco shows the more tender side of the organized crime world (don't get me wrong, it shows plenty of the ruthlessness too), the concept of 'honor among thieves' if you will.  You realize that even though these mobsters might appear to be scum on the outside, they do have hearts and they do have feelings.  The scene where Lefty is waiting outside the hospital room where his son is, and Donnie comes in is a very good example of this.  After a little conversation between the two, Lefty simply looks at Brasco and says 'I love you Donnie.'  It's scenes like this (as well as the scene at the end) that are so moving, you begin to realize just how powerful movies can be.  This one reaches down inside and really makes you feel, and it really makes you think.  It's simply one of the most unique, and beautifully crafted mob movies ever made, as well as one of the best films of 1997.",9,1,1,8 March 1999
Midsommar," Far Too Long With No Redeeming Qualities
","**Note...there could be **SPOILERS** in this review if there truly is anyone who doesn't know exactly where this predictable and overly-long film (please Aster...for the love of all that is holy and good, employ an editor who has the balls to stand up to you and tell you that your movie is going to be too long) is going**It became fairly evident early on in Midsommar that this wasn't going to go anywhere, except right where Ari Aster wanted it to go. Now, you might be thinking 'well it's his movie, it should go where he wants it to go.' And I agree. However, in a good movie, where the director wants a movie to go isn't so obvious right out of the starting gate. Aster isn't interested in creating real characters who would make decisions that real people would make. He manipulates his characters and he provides circumstances that pretty much forces them to make decisions that are so stupid and so irrational, that it becomes very difficult to care about any of them. Why would I? None of them seem like actual people. I could list numerous examples of what I'm talking about, but then I'd have to write more about this steaming pile of pretentious, wanna-be art house crap than I want to (and people will give me grief about writing spoilers and such). So I'll mention one. As soon as our wooden and robotic puppet characters get to this commune/cult place they are told that when you reach a certain age, then that's it...that's all she wrote so-to-speak. And then, we as the audience, are supposed to be horrified when something happens that any movie-goer with half a brain could see coming from a mile away. So what do our characters do? Do they turn tale and run? Do they get together and make a plan to escape in the night (oh wait...that's right...is it night or is it day? Note to Will Poulter's character: when you get closer to the arctic circle the days are longer in the summertime)? No. A few of them were truly upset with what they witnessed, but then some of the other visitors rationalize what happened and all is well again...until the next disturbing ritual, and the next, and the next. It's preposterous and ridiculous and almost no one makes any kind of decision that makes sense. One of the people who saw this movie with me tried to make it make sense (always a bad sign when one has to manipulate circumstances in their mind to try and make a movie character's decisions make sense) . They said, 'Well, they made bad decisions because their minds were altered.' The problem is, their minds weren't altered the whole time. And how's this for a rational decision? Stop drinking and eating crap, when you know that the last crap you drank and ate caused some serious issues and problems. The whole thing is just dumb. And I don't call very many movies dumb. There are plenty of movies that suck. But I will usually stop just short of calling them stupid or dumb. This movie, minus the acting, was both. And before anyone tries to bring up Aster's last film, Hereditary, save your breath (or finger strength). I saw it, and I didn't like it as much as I liked this one. I will give Aster another shot. I think directors and screenwriters deserve the same chance that a baseball player gets when they're up. However, I think I know what the result will be. He'll basically make a carbon copy of what he's already made. It will be Hereditary and Midsommar packaged a little differently, but the results will probably be the same. It will be full of disturbing images surrounded by stupid characters who make some of the most irrational decisions in the history of mankind. And if you feel the same way I do, then I'm here for you. I already know what kind of grief someone can get when they go against the grain. You'll be ridiculed and told how shallow you are. **People will accuse you of not getting 'it' (whatever 'it' is). Just know that most of them are like most of the critics who raved and went on and on about how great it was. Sometimes when a snow ball gets rolling, no one wants to be the one who gets out of the way, lest others think they are cowards. Once the initial praise for this film started, no one (no movie-goer, no critic, etc.) wanted to be the one accused of not being creative enough, or intelligent enough, or as sophisticated enough, to really understand this film. And so the praise just kept on coming. And at that point, it was all over. Midsommar was branded a horror movie masterpiece. The problem is, it's not horror (there is not a genuinely frightening or disturbing moment in the whole film) and it sure ain't no masterpiece. If you are still a bit nervous to actually tell people how you really felt about this piece of garbage, then don't worry. Just know that you are not alone.** - I wanted to write this addendum to bring your attention to what I'm talking about as far as people ridiculing others because those others weren't 'smart' enough to get what was going on in this film. A reviewer by the name of Lonnis_Cult wrote a review on February 4, 2020, ridiculing others who wrote negative reviews about this piece of crap film. Apparently Lonnis_Cult is one of the most intellegent people in the world whose brain is much more advanced than those of us who hated this stupid movie. It's your typical, narcissistic and arrogant tripe that people write to try and puff themselves up by pretending that this was a complex and intricately woven masterpiece (It's not), and they understood it when others, apparently didn't. Lonnis_Cult also made an absurd statement about how this movie, and especially Florence Pugh's performance, was raved about by critics, so that means the movie and Pugh's performance have to be very good. Here's his reason for making that conclusion: Lonnis said that since critics are the ones who 'know what they're talking about when it comes to filmmaking,' then that means Pugh's performance and the movie are great. In other words, he seems to indicate that critics are always right. Why? Well he gives no explanation. Lonnis also has quite a negative attitude towards movies with CGI and jump scares. He suggests that such films are 'crap,' (his word) and implies that they're only for anti-intellectual simpletons. However, critics loved Avengers Endgame and The Conjuring. Those two movies have an abundance of CGI and jump scares respectively. Rotten Tomatoes gives Avengers Endgame a 94% rating and The Conjuring an 85% rating. Midsommar only has an 83% rating on RT. According to Lonnis's logic, that must mean that Avengers Endgame and The Conjuring are, not only great movies, but they're better films than Midsommar, since they have better ratings from the critics, and according to Lonnis, critics know what they're talking about when it comes to filmmaking. Hey Lonnis...just using YOUR WORDS, as well as YOUR LOGIC to make that conclusion.",2,4,8,6 February 2020
Taken," Every Now And Then...
","What can I say? Every now and then you need a movie like this. One where you can just sit back, and enjoy the ride. Yes, this was Bourne without the thinking...Bond without most of the gadgets...and the thinking. Yes, the plot was simple. Basically it can be summed up like this: Man has someone he loves taken from him. Man then does anything, and I MEAN anything, to try and get said loved one back. Many, many dead people later man gets loved one back. That's about it. But the action is almost non-stop once it gets going, and I can honestly say that I was thoroughly entertained for most of this movie (the first fifteen minutes, and the last two I could have done without). Neeson is not as polished looking as Matt Damon. He's not even as rugged or as tough looking as Daniel Craig. But he plays this character in the way it was meant to be played. He's the type of person you can believe in...literally. When he says he's going to do something, he does it (and then some). Is this movie going to win any awards? No. Is it going to be in many people's top ten? Probably not. But, and nowadays this is pretty doggone important, it will get you your ten bucks worth. And that's more than can be said for most of the movies that get released this time of year.",7,2,4,13 February 2009
The Happening," Three Strikes...And He's Out
","M. Night Shyamalan was once one of the most promising young talents in Hollywood. His films were dramatic, yet suspenseful. His writing was creative and unique. He produced one great film (The Sixth Sense), and two pretty good ones (Unbreakable and Signs). But then there was a 'happening,' and it wasn't plants killing people. No, the 'happening' that I am speaking of is the total collapse of a promising career. It started with 'The Village' (strike one). It did have atmosphere. The acting was good. However, it all built up to one of the most anti-climactic conclusions that I have ever seen. At that point however, I gave M. Night the benefit of the doubt. I mean everyone makes mistakes. Even Steven Spielberg created some crap early in his career (i.e. '1941'). But then came 'Lady in the Water' (strike two). There was really nothing good about this film, although the acting was still pretty decent. This is, however, M. Night's worst creation. It honestly felt as if he wrote dialogue for the scenes right before filming them. At this point, I was a bit nervous. Sure 'The Village' had a crappy conclusion, but most of what preceded that crappy conclusion was pretty decent. 'Lady in the Water' was pretty much all crap. And finally, we come to 'The Happening' (strike three...he's out). I had a feeling this was going to be pretty bad when the T.V. trailers started to market this movie, not by using M. Night's name, but in proclaiming how this was his first 'R' rated film. My suspicions were, unfortunately, correct. This was bad all the way around. The directing, the editing, the acting, the screenplay (horrible dialogue which, in my opinion, led to the bad acting). The only reason I give this three out of ten stars, and rate it just barely above 'Lady in the Water' is because, every now and then, there were some scenes that had a genuine creepiness about them. And that's just it. It is obvious that M. Night has talent. Somewhere, after wading through all the crap that was 'The Happening,' there is a guy who knows how to send chills up your spine. But I honestly believe that it's time for M. Night to lay the pen down, and start directing someone else's script. Is it too late? Well, as far as I am concerned it's three strikes and he's out. I will not shell out 9 bucks to go see a sub-par M. Night movie again. And that's a shame. Because this was once one of the most promising talents in all of Hollywood.",3,3,6,4 July 2008
Mystic River," Another good movie with so-so ending
","**Spoilers** I am not really sure what to say about Mystic River.  All the elements were present to make a great movie, and yet somehow I felt very unsatisfied when all was said and done.  The acting was tremendous, and the direction seemed flawless.  The cinematography was eerily beautiful, and even the score was decent (seeing as it was written by Clint Eastwood himself).  However, in the end I was left with more questions then answers, and in a sense, felt cheated.  Perhaps it is my own fault.  I probably should have read the book before seeing the movie.  Then maybe I wouldn't have been scratching my head during that parade scene at the end.  The movie would have ended perfectly if it had concluded with Jimmy and Sean standing in the street, pondering the 'what ifs' in life.  Instead it moved into this surreal parade scene that, I'm sure made sense in the book, but was confusing at best on screen. It seems that this scene was trying to convey certain thoughts and feelings without any words.  In a book this is easy to do because even though the characters aren't saying anything, we are told what they are thinking by the author.  In a theatre, on screen, conveying thoughts and feelings through gestures and facial expressions just doesn't cut it.  At least not in this situation.  I'm not sure if Sean, with his gun gesture, was saying to Jimmy 'Hey, way to go,' or 'Hey, I'm gonna get you for murdering Dave.'  Oh well. Mystic River is a decent movie.  I just wish the ending would have shed some light on everything that had come before it.",6,0,0,23 October 2003
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The Very Definition Of Excessive Self Indulgence
","While watching Transformers 2, I could almost picture it in my mind. I could see Michael Bay, sitting in the editing room, mesmerized by all the footage that was shot, coupled with the mind-blowing special effects mixed in, overwhelmed by it all. I could almost hear his very thoughts at that moment: 'I can't let any of this go.' And so he didn't. Which means that what ended up on screen was the result of his inability to let a story be the guiding factor, and allowing his self indulgence to take over. All of that put together equals this: a nuclear explosion of unbelievable eye candy with almost no sign of a coherent storyline. It also equaled a movie that was, at the very least, 30 minutes too long. Very disappointing. I guess, though, that I'm to blame just as much as anyone else. I dropped 10 bucks down the drain faster than you can say Megatron. And by doing that, I guess I provided the justification that Bay needed for this sub-par mess. The idea that, as long as it looks neat, and things blow up real good, then that's all that matters. No doubt this movie will make millions upon millions. It may even reach the billion dollar range. But that doesn't make it o.k., and it doesn't make it a good movie. Heck, it doesn't even make it a decent movie. And I hope Bay will realize that. Because if he doesn't, then we can all expect to see it again in the third installment. And that will be the real shame. But as I have said before, that's just my opinion.",3,9,21,26 June 2009
Crazy Heart," Exceptional Acting In A Pretty Decent Movie
","Sometimes an acting performance is so good, that it makes a film much better than it would have been otherwise. For me, Crazy Heart is one of those films. Jeff Bridges takes this movie, throws it on his back, and then exceptionally marches it through a story that was interesting, but not entirely memorable, and a screenplay that was passable, but certainly not remarkable. And it's not just Bridges who shines here. Maggie Gyllenhaal also turns in an impressive performance that was well deserving of it's Oscar nomination. Even Colin Farrel and Robert Duvall make the most of what they are given here. But even the great acting could not catapult Heart into the realm of movie greatness. And much of that has to do with the fact that there were some flaws that simply cannot be ignored. First, even though Bridges and Gyllenhaal did have good chemistry, something about their characters' relationship just didn't seem genuine. I think much of that had to do with the fact that it developed unrealistically quickly. There were also decisions made by some of the characters that did not seem real. For example, we are led to believe that Gylenhaal's Jean Craddock is very weary when it comes to men and relationships. We are led to believe that her son is the single most important thing in her life, and that she would protect him at all costs. And yet, for some reason, she quickly jumps into a relationship with Blake, a man who is as damaged and self destructive as one can get. Not only that, she also doesn't think twice about leaving her son in the care of Blake on two different occasions. I just didn't buy it. To me, these decisions were based more on plot development, and not on trying to portray behavior that would be exhibited by real people. And in a film where these decisions make up a very large part of what this movie is about, that's a problem. However, even with these problems, I still liked Crazy Heart. I still think it's a pretty decent movie with some exceptional acting. But I can't help to think that, perhaps, it would have been better for the audience if it was the other way around.",6,2,3,21 March 2010
Army of Darkness," Hilarious and Entertaining
","This was a hilarious and entertaining movie.  I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is one you want to get when you think you want to see a scary movie, but really want to see a funny movie.  The medieval premise was genius, and really added to the feel.  Army of Darkness is just a fun movie.  That's about all I have to say about this one.",7,1,1,12 April 1999
It Chapter Two," Second Time The First Part Was Better Than The Second Part
","They say that most people learn from their mistakes. Maybe that's true, I don't know. However, what is less true I believe, is someone learning from someone else's mistakes. No one wants to think that they're susceptible to the same potential problems as someone else. And I think that's one of the issues when it comes to It Chapter Two. Andy Muschietti (director) and Gary Dauberman (writer) had the example of It (1990), the television miniseries that was very popular, to learn from. The main problem the miniseries had was that when the makers decided to split the film into two distinct parts (instead of interweaving the kids' story with the adults' story like the book), the first part was largely considered better than the the second part. In other words, the kids' part of the story (as well as the child actors' performances) were better and more interesting than the part of the story with the adults. Well guess what? Muschietti and Dauberman, knowing this, decided to go the same route, and split the part of the story with the children up from the part of the story with the adults. And the results were pretty much the same. Most people consider It (2017) to be much better than It Chapter Two (2019). Including me. IC2 is a number of things. Unfortunately none of them are positive. It is too long. It is too convoluted. And, quite simply, it is no where near as good as the first chapter. I had a feeling that this was going to be the case. Even when one of the story lines for a certain adult gets shortened before the rest of the adults get together, it's not enough to lighten the load with too many characters. And the problem is, the makers of the film obviously felt as if each character had to have equal screen time with equal scary events happening to each one. And going through those stories one by one, in that manner, takes away any kind of surprise that may have otherwise existed. And when there aren't any real surprises in a movie that's supposed to be scary...well let's just say that tends to neutralize the frightening parts of the film. In other words, it's poison. How disappointing. Perhaps, if anyone ever decides to adapt this story again into a film (honestly I, and a host of others really hope that never happens) they will try and tell the two parts of the story the same way Stephen King tells the story in the novel...simultaneously.",5,0,2,25 November 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," one of the best
","The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made.  There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most.  I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would have been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough. It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had to sit back breathless.  I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned.  A true classic!",10,3,5,18 November 1998
Marriage Story," One Of The Best
","I debated whether or not to even write anything about Marriage Story. It has touched so many people, and I don't want to come at this disrespectfully, because, in my life, I have not experienced divorce. My wife and I have been married happily for 20 years. My parents are about to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. And both my maternal and paternal grandparents were married for nearly 70 years and nearly 50 years respectively. So I guess I feel like I'm trespassing here. But I love movies. And I loved this one. And there are many things that are done well in this film. so here I go. First I should say that I have not been a huge fan of Noah Baumbach in the past. It is not like I have anything against directors who concentrate on smaller stories that seem as if they are actually pulled from the pages of real life. In fact, I love independent cinema when it is done well. Alexander Payne, Kenneth Lonergan, and Wes Anderson (although Anderson's films are more surreal sometimes) are some of my favorite directors. Again I think this movie is done well. The screenplay is very good. The acting is phenomenal, worthy of the award nominations I am sure are going to come to fruition. And the direction always seems sure of itself (save for a few scenes that go on longer than they should). But it's more than that. However, before I expand on that let me address some of the things that may make people a little hesitant about seeing Story. It's depressing. There is no getting around that. in fact, there is a point in Story where the depressing part of the film becomes so overwhelming, that it actually begins to almost physically hurt. it's predictable and it knows it. Almost from frame one, everyone who I saw it with knew exactly where it was going. And like in real life, there is no real silver lining. But it's not hopeless. And here is why, if people are hesitant to see this movie, they should ignore those feelings of hesitation. The son. As far as hope is concerned, the son in this film is the most hopeful part of the this couple's existence. He is the glue that keeps the lives of the characters together, even when divorce rips them apart. And as far as it being depressing...well...that's life . But I can say that every depressing experience that I have ever been a part of, and although divorce has not affected me, I have still had my fair share depressing moments, there's always a ray of hope somewhere. The lives of these people have that ray of hope as well. And because of that, there is a feeling that they, in the long run, will be alright. Another reason to see this movie has to do with the supporting characters. From the attorneys, to the extended families, almost everyone has someone who lifts them up when everything comes crashing down. One of my favorite songs is called 'Held,' by Natalie Grant. In it, there is a line that I love. Grant clearly means it in a religious sense, but almost anyone can relate to it. It says,This is what it means to be held,
how it feels when the sacred is torn from your life
and you survive.
This is what it is to be loved
and to know that the promise was
when everything fell we'd be heldEveryone has someone who, when life comes crashing down, will hold them. When Story was over, l felt like that would be true for the two main characters in the story. No matter what...no matter where they end up, they will always have the people in their lives to count on. And I think that even includes each other.",9,5,14,2 December 2019
The Truman Show," Good movie!
","The Truman Show is most certainly one of the best movies so far this year. This movie was funny, sad, and powerful with performances that are top notch.  Jim Carrey better get an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Truman Burbank.  Carrey was perfect as the typical 'Leave It To Beaver' kind of guy, who turns out to be a real person, who has real feelings.  You see, it's not the 'Leave It To Beaver' part that is so great about his performance, it's the metamorphic change that occurs in Truman where he moves from the 'Leave It To Beaver' guy to the real man, who will stop at nothing to know the truth.  This isn't a movie where you can just sit back and enjoy the ride.  You have to think, and if you look close enough, you will see the quietly powerful message; the message of hope and freedom, the idea that no innocent man or woman can be kept in some place against their will, and the idea that if deception is involved, then eventually truth will prevail and hope and freedom will be restored.",8,0,0,22 October 1998
Heat," Great Film
","Heat is simply one great film.  There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said about this classic.  If you want to see two brilliant actors at the top of their game, then you have to see this movie.  It is perfectly written and directed by Michael Mann, one of the best film makers today. Mann picks and chooses his projects wisely (note:  he has only directed six or seven Hollywood movies in the last twenty or so years), and they almost always differ in content (ex. this is the same guy who directed one of my personal favorites 'The Last Of The Mohicans').  A great all around film, and certainly a classic in the cops and robbers genre, Heat certainly makes the grade as far as I am concerned.",9,0,0,10 November 2001
Moon," One Of The Best Films Of The Year
","After weeks of waiting, I finally got the chance to see Moon tonight at a local theater. I have to say, I was not disappointed, and it was worth the wait. This is one of the best films of the year, and one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long time. There are some very complex issues that are dealt with here that one rarely sees nowadays on film, and especially in a Sci Fi film. Ethics, morality, sacrifice, and even hope are all examined with care and consideration. I would say that Moon is the very antithesis to a film like Transformers 2, a movie that was almost all special effects brawn, with very little brains. In Moon, an intelligent story is told that was very well written. And although there are few characters, they are still characters that the viewer comes to care for. Sam Rockwell deserves any and all awards that will be given to him for this role. If I had to use only one word to describe his performance, it would be this: Powerful. And when the best picture noms are handed out in January by the Academy, I would be very surprised if Moon is not on the list. Kudos to Duncan Jones for crafting one fine motion picture, and for having the guts to tackle a difficult genre for his first feature length film. This is one that will make many other first time directors green with envy.",9,2,3,18 July 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A Masterpiece
","First, I want to say that I have waited two days to post this review. The reason I waited? I wanted to make sure that my feelings about this movie right after I saw it were genuine, and that I wasn't just caught up in the hype that surrounds this film. Slumdog Millionaire is a masterpiece, and quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in the last fifteen years. It is the ultimate story of hope and redemption, and it ends on a note so satisfying, that the only other movie I can even think of comparing it to (as far as satisfying endings are concerned) is The Shawshank Redemption. I don't know if Slumdog is as good as Shawshank, but I do know that it is pretty darn close. What's even more amazing is that I don't think I have ever heard of any of these actors, and yet all of them give powerful, compelling performances. Indeed, the only person's name I did recognize in the credits is Danny Boyle's. And what a movie Boyle has orchestrated here. It is my opinion that one could not ask for anything more from a movie than what is present in Slumdog. We have action, we have suspense, and we have loads of drama. There's tragedy, and there's triumph. It has a wonderfully written screenplay, and is edited in such a way that the pace of the film never slows down. I was so engrossed in this film, and the journey that is taken by the characters, that I honestly could not believe that I had sat in a theater for just over two hours. I know there will be naysayers here. But they will be few and far between. There will be cynics that complain about the unrealistic nature of the 'coincidences,' and there will be those who are unconvinced by the happy ending. But they will be a small minority. And they are entitled to their opinion. However, it is my opinion that if you love movies, and if you are looking for a powerful story about ordinary people surrounded by extraordinary circumstances, then you need to see this movie. Trust me. It is the type of cinematic experience that only comes around once in a great while.",10,4,8,21 December 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," A Movie That Loses Its Way
","Law Abiding Citizen, in a way, is a movie that became too big for it's own good. The Gerard Butler character was a mastermind. He was so intelligent that no one could figure out how he was doing the things he was doing. So crafty, that no matter what safety precautions were taken, people were still dying. The problem, though, became very apparent as Citizen was nearing the last half hour. How do you explain it all. It's almost as if 3/4 of this movie was made, and then the makers remembered that they had to end this thing. And so they did. Only what we were given, the resolution to it all, was so anticlimactic (and for that matter, unbelievable) that it was almost laughable. I think it would have been better to leave it a mystery then to give the audience what was one of the most outlandish conclusions to a film I've seen in a long time. That's not to say that what came before this was a masterpiece. The dialogue was, at times decent, and at other times sub-par. The characters were never developed enough for people to really care about what happened to them, and the editing left something to be desired. But even with all of that I was still interested. I still wanted to see where all of this was going, and how all of this was happening. I shouldn't have been so eager. They say that sometimes, the unknown is much more intriguing than the known. I guess the makers of this film should have kept that in mind.",6,25,31,21 October 2009
Up in the Air," Good Movie...But Not Without Flaws
","**Major Spoilers** For about two thirds of Up In The Air, I was thinking to myself, 'this is definitely going to be on my top five list for the year.' The acting is very good. The characters were strong and likable. The dialogue was sharp and witty. There seemed to be the right mixture of both comedy and drama. It felt like a movie that was going somewhere great. Then came the rest of the story. Don't get me wrong. I've seen some films before that were ruined by bad endings. Up In The Air does not fall into that category. In fact, I wouldn't even call the ending bad. It was just not as well done as the rest of the movie. It felt hurried and predictable. I honestly don't think any of the events that occurred at the end of the film were a surprise to anyone watching (including the 'major' revelation about Vera Farmiga's character). And a few of the scenes felt like they were slipped in out of obligation (i.e. the scene where Clooney's character calls the airline to set up a trip for his sister and her husband, or when we find out that Anna Kendrick's character quit because of the suicide). However, even with all of that, I still liked it. There was still so much that was good about this movie, that it might not be on my top five list for the year, but it is definitely on my top ten.",8,25,40,5 January 2010
