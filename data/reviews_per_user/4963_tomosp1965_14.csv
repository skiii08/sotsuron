Source Code," Just Awesome!
","I have given other films a 10 and they were great, this film is in a different league! Gyllenhall is fabulous in his roll and his fine acting only helps build the tension, as we go on a train journey that feels more like a roller-coaster ride.The premise of the film is whether love can conquer time and fate itself. Is time something that is set in stone, or can it be manipulated? Reasoning says no, but quantum physics implies yes. This is a clever film and has a well thought out script. I implore people to watch it and hopefully come to the same conclusion.",10,1,4,21 April 2015
Se7en," May be the best film ever!
","This film may be the best film I have ever watched. I was gripped from start to finish and actually applauded when the credits started to roll. The last time I did that, was when I watched 'The Sixth Sense'. The writing is exceptional, the plot believable and the acting is of the finest standard. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt make a great partnership, even though it would seem unlikely, given their different approaches to dealing with homicide cases.I would ask everyone to try not to second guess the outcome, but rather follow the clues, as the detectives do.This is a fine film of the finest quality, with an ending to make your hairs stand on end.",10,2,3,28 March 2015
Fury," 1945's Platoon!
","This film is great in parts and a bit long winded in others. Pitt is excellent in the role of war weary sergeant and gives a gutsy performance. Shia Labeouf is good, Pena and Bernthal are OK, but the best acting is by the young Logan Lerman in the roll of 'Norman'. I feel this film would have been better condensed into 90 minutes, instead of the 2 hour 14 minutes it ended up as. The length of some of the scenes is unnecessary, and in the tension of war you expect something to happen, but it doesn't most of the time.This is not a pretty film in many scenes and the blood and guts may upset the weak willed, but for those of you who like that kind of film, then this film is a must.When it ends, see if you think.......'Platoon'.",7,1,5,20 April 2015
Darkest Hour," Oh, what a war we fought.
","Gary Oldman gives a masterclass of acting, portraying one of Great Britain's greatest leaders.I think the reviews, (so far) that give low points, are from those who have seen too many movies that dramatise and falsify war, so obviously expected it from this film.The acting is marvelous, the cinematography excellent, and the script true to the actuality of Churchills pondering and orations of that time. Not one part of the film was overdone, nor was it turned into a blood and guts, flag waving fantasy. The events Britain faced in 1940 are honestly depicted and not one compromise is given away to the sensationalist.I think this is a great film, but it may take time to be accepted as one of the best war films ever made.10/10",10,0,2,9 May 2020
Oblivion," An epic 'pick and mix' of Sci-Fi classics.
","I so wish I hadn't seen The Matrix, Star Wars, Mad Max, Armageddon, or in fact many other great futuristic, apocalyptic or space themed movies, as this film wouldn't have got a 6, it would have been a ten!The pro's of this film are: The score, (Which is wonderful), the cinematography and the visual effects. It is beautifully made and the CGI doesn't affect or interfere with the flow of the movie.The cons are: The script is somewhat plagiarized from other films of this kind. In fact its the Sci-Fi equivalent of ' Hot Shots' or 'Scary Movie'. What I mean is, you see the influences of many film's in this one. Also, its a ninety minute film, not two and a half hours.Don't get me wrong, its a good film, some may even say its fantastic. Others, who have seen all the above mentioned movies, will say its rubbish. I think I am being fair and judging it on its merits, its OK as a movie and I enjoyed it.",6,0,0,23 April 2015
Gran Torino," Good film, great lead, poor support.
","Having watched this film for a second time, (To make sure I didn't miss something), I am slightly confused by the rating in IMDb's top 250. This is a good film, with a fine script and Eastwood is excellent in the role of the cantankerous old racist. What lets this film down is the supporting cast of 'unknowns'. To say some of the acting from them was not at its best, well that would be an understatement. Bee Vang is trying to act on a par with Eastwood and fails, he instead comes across as wooden. The script though is excellent and says all you need to say about modern society. I feel that this film could have been an all time classic if better actors had been in the support roles.",6,0,3,7 April 2015
Elysium," Why so long, why so confusing?
","My points are for the CGI alone, the rest of the film is too long and too confusing. I have lots of issues with this movie, but I will not go on and on about them, I will just mention my main issue again, why is it so long? This film could have been done and dusted in 80 minutes, but no, it just goes on and on, which resulted in me getting bored and wondering why I bothered going to watch it.Oblivion, which is kind of similar, is a masterpiece compared to this yawn fest. I see that in the reviews, people are 50/50 in their appreciation or condemnation of this film, I am in the latter camp. It could have been so good, but I'm afraid the director spent to much time picking scenes where CGI could be incorporated. This detracts from what isn't a bad premise. Don't get me wrong, the CGI is excellent, its just that its over applied in many scenes.",4,0,1,28 April 2015
In Time," Spending time wisely till the clock reaches zero.
","This is a great concept for a film, its just not as fine tuned a film as it could have been. Time being the most important thing in everyone's life, becomes a statement that was never so true.The premise is this: The characters live In a world where money is obsolete. A persons age, or the time they have to live, becomes transferable, which can then be used to purchase life's essentials. No one can live past 26, that is unless they can get extra time, either legally or illegally. The rich of course, don't have the problems poorer people do and live in a different 'time zone'. Thats where the question, can someone poor escape their existence, is pondered! I won't add more, as it may spoil your viewing.There is some fine acting from the cast in the movie, but unfortunately that doesn't include the lead. Timberlake fails to impress and his acting is not quite good enough. Strangely enough, I feel that Mark Wahlberg could have done a better job as the lead. They're both former pop idols, but Wahlberg is definitely in a different acting league.8 out of 10",8,0,0,5 May 2015
12 Years a Slave," The Count of Monte Alabama!
","I thought this story was reminiscent of Dumas's 'The Count of Monte Cristo', so much so that I knew what would happen at the end and that he would attain his freedom.Its a depressing and brutal film, which of course depicts how it must have been for the slaves. I applaud the acting from most of the cast and appreciate that Pitt and McQueen would have had a hard job convincing actors to participate in this film. The whole shameful episode of slavery is an emotive subject and must be difficult to portray in a way that neither attracts subscription to far right ideology, nor receives condemnation of its portrayal.I think the film is OK as films go, but the subject matter and the depressing script, may leave people wishing that it wasn't such shocking viewing.5 out of 10",8,3,4,28 April 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog day on steroids.
","Why does Hollywood have such a fascination with 'time reversal' movies? This film is yet another one in the genre, where the lead character lives the same day over and over again. It may be possible if we consider the 'many world's' theory, but again, the film at no time suggests this. It incorporates elements of other films you may have seen, like 'groundhog day' or 'predestination' etc, but for a loop to be created that makes a mockery of time continuum, then the 'other world's' theory must be included as part of the dialog. Its the only way someone watching can make sense of it. This is a visually spectacular movie, where the use of CGI is never underused. Cruise portrays a believable character, where, on his journey of self discovery and stoic bravery, he leads the viewer into a world of alien invasion and terror. Blunt too is excellent, playing the hardened, war weary veteran, with charisma and balls. There are comedy moments and lighthearted homages to other films like it, but overall this is a tense action thriller that leaves a lasting memory.There are too many paradoxes created in this film for it to work in the quantum physics world, but its enjoyable.8 out of 10",8,0,1,6 May 2015
Shooter," Firing killer shots in a killer movie!
","This movie is an excellent romp through a world of military people, espionage people, government people and ordinary people. Its a world where you're never sure who to trust, with interesting statements, where some of the revealing hypothesis raised in this movie are probably true. There are many 'lone wolf' based films, some good, some bad, this is another one. What makes this film different though is the brilliant script, plus the believable plot.Wahlberg is magnificent as the disgruntled and disillusioned gunnery Sergeant and gives a performance that deserves merit. There are also great performances from Danny Glover and Ned Beatty, they give the film a sinister edge. The only miscasting is Michael Pena, I felt he didn't fit as the rookie FBI agent.The movie is the best in its genre and takes the viewer on a twisted journey through the world of money motivated industrialists, power driven politicians, psychopathic mercenaries and weapon experts.Go buy it, you won't be disappointed. 9 out of 10",9,0,1,4 May 2015
Inception," Intrude, interfere, influence, inception. Pure genius!
","My oh my, this film is something of a masterpiece. I expected a lot from this film, (given all I had heard about it) I got a lot more than I had bargained for.Di-caprio is one of the finest contemporary actors in Hollywood, giving a wonderful performance as 'Cobb' the flawed extractor. He shows in this film why he is sought after by directors. In fact all the performances were excellent in this movie, which only compliments the beautiful score and brilliant writing.Its the special effects that deserve the most applause, as they take us literally into the psychedelic world of the dream-state. I can honestly say that the CGI in this film is the best I have ever witnessed.Nolan is a genius who not only writes fantastic stories, he makes fantastic films too.This is a movie that doesn't disappoint and finds a place in my all time 20 favorites.10 out of 10",10,0,2,9 May 2015
Looper," A bit of a 'Time' waster!
","I so looked forward to this film, as I enjoy 'timetravel' movies. But after sitting through nearly two and a half hours of this movie, I left relieved it was finally finished, and bemused as to why the makers had chosen to have so many long boring scenes. The actors look bored most of the time, and there is some miscasting. Bruce Willis seems to have been cast as a lure for the paying public, whilst Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a dreary and unlikely action hero.The story is puzzling, leaving more questions than answers, plus the premise is weak, which left me bemused and head scratching at the end.As for entertainment, well its an OK film. The action, (though sparse) will keep you watching, but at the end you will wonder why you bothered.",6,0,0,27 April 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Chavs posh wet dream
","It is a good film even though the young recruit is annoying. I find it improbable that a street talking waster could be accepted into an upper class organization. The premise may have been more believable if the recruit was middle class rather than from the 'ghetto'. Samuel L Jackson is fantastic as the evil tycoon and Colin Firth is also great as the Bond like agent. Michael Caine does a good job as the 'M' character, its just the hero of the film who doesn't fit with the rest of the cast.There is a lot of product placement and it isn't difficult to see who sponsored the film.This film is OK, but it isn't great. 6 out of ten.",6,2,7,2 May 2015
