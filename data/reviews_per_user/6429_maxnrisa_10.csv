The Blair Witch Project," A few things to cheer about, but basically a waste of celluloid.
","Good Points: There aren't any.  I meant it.  This movie is the single most ridiculous and pathetic attempt at suspense I've ever seen.  The only good things I can say about are: A) The acting actually isn't bad, astounding as it may seem.  B) I admire that the actors worked without a script.  It requires genuine acting skill and I applaud their dedication.Bad Points: Everything else.  The entire movie is seen from the points of view of two video cameras the characters brought with them, so right off the bat there's not much to be said for direction or cinematography.  The story is boring.  A bunch of students going off into the woods in search of proof of witch stories in a local town sounds like a good plot at first, but it doesn't go anywhere.  Literally.  You never find out what happened to everyone.  You never get to see the 'witch.'  The ending is absolutely the biggest let down of any movie I've ever seen.Bottom Line: Save your money and rent something else.  This movie, to put it simply, sucks.",2,1,3,12 November 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Razor-sharp directing and unique approach make for a great movie.
","Good Points:  This, friends, is the future of filmmaking.  Director Darren Aronofsky slices open the rose-tinted haze, exposing the reality for you and does not for one iota sugar-coat this film based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel about the lovely effects of heavy drug use on the lives of four radically different characters.  Psychedelic.  On the edge.  In your face.  Very creative visuals.  Aronofsky is original, which is something the movie biz needs.  BADLY.Bad Points:  Not much to complain about here, although people expecting a happy ending will be disappointed...and GOOD FOR YA TOO!  Life don't always have a happy ending, kiddies.  If you want fantasy, go watch Peter Pan. Reality bites.  Now open your brain and sit down.Bottom Line:  Incredible and unique movie.  A nice change from the processed movie food Hollywood usually crams down our throats.",9,0,1,12 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a bad movie, but still more of the same.
","Good Points:  Clearly the strength of Phantom Menace lies in the visuals. Lucas makes the most of current FX tech with mind-blowing computer animated eye candy.  Also, we finally get to see Jedi combat the was it was probably meant to be all along.  Well-choreographed fight scenes are abundant, and if the pod race doesn't make you grip your arm rests and grit your teeth, then you must be from L.A.Bad Points:  More so than in any other Star Wars movie, the story is severely lacking.  It's hard to punch Lucas in the arm for this, though, as he's clearly setting things up for the next movie.  We may very well experience the something similar to the original three films, having the middle movie turn out to be the best.  But by itself, the story is nothing special.  And as far as I'm concerned, Jar Jar Binks can take a long walk out a short airlock.  This character serves one purpose: comic relief. That's it.  Totally unnecessary, and further illustrating Lucas's penchant for keeping things just cheesy enough to make intelligent adults get that 'Oh...come ON!' look.  Even the title is ridiculous.  'Phantom Menace' sounds like a Scooby Doo episode.Bottom Line:  Basically an enjoyable movie, but it just doesn't capture the drama of the other Star Wars films (what there was of it).  If you're a Star Wars fan or into eye candy, you won't want to miss it.  But don't expect to come away with the meaning of life.",7,1,2,14 November 2001
X-Men," Not bad, but not great, either.
","Good Points:  It is an entertaining flick, in spite of its flaws, with plenty of sweet eye candy.  The mutants' powers are nicely brought to life through the miracle of CGI.  Kudos to Patrick Stewart who played a wonderful Professor X, Ian McKellen as the perfect Magneto, and Hugh Jackman who deserves every penny he gets for playing Wolverine with charisma and style without coming across cheesy like everyone else in the cast.  Bad Points: It's not that the movie is BAD per se, but there's nothing outstanding about it.  The directing is decent but not ground-breaking, and aside from Stewart, McKellen, and Jackman, the acting is nothing special.  Bottom Line: Kids will love it.  For the adults, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.",5,1,2,12 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Not as great as the first two Star Wars flicks, but pretty good.
","Good Points:  Again, it's more of the same great operatic sci-fi stuff from Lucas and the guys.  The story moves along nicely through this wonderful fantasy universe highlighted with sweet FX from the geniuses at ILM.  The climax where Luke finally turns to the dark side and attacks Vader is on my Top 10 list of all time great scenes.  Truly a stroke of cinematic storytelling genius.  Bad Points:  Well, by now, some flaws are bound to manifest themselves. 'More of the same' is ironically bad as well as good.  Sticking with what works is fine, but there's really nothing new here.  It's more cool looking ships, weird aliens, climactic battle scenes, and the whole good vs. evil jazz.  Also, older audiences will roll their eyes when the Ewoks make their appearance.  I understand Lucas wants to make Star Wars enjoyable to all audiences, but I think the Teddy Bear thing is going a little too far into the cheese dip.Bottom Line:  Not as a good as the first two Star Wars movies, but definitely worth watching.  I mean...if you've sat through the first two, you may as well see how the whole thing ends, right?",8,0,1,14 November 2001
Cast Away," Not much substance here, but Tom Hanks fans will (sadly) love it.
","Good Points:  About the only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was, overall, well made.  Robert Zemeckis makes a good movie any way you slice it, and no one can debate Tom Hanks' acting prowess.  The rest of the cast did well also.  Bad Points:  But there it ends.  There's nothing in Cast Away that hasn't been done already.  You've got your typical 'stranded on a desert island' theme coupled with the 'trying to return to a life after years of being out in left field somewhere' idea, and it just makes for a rehash of old plot devices.  And, I'm sorry, but ANYONE in their right mind would have ripped open that package in record time in case anything it held could aid in survival instead of keeping it intact so that it could be later delivered (you know...on the off chance you DON'T starve to death) with a burst of pride for a job well done.  GIVE ME A BREAK.  I swear, every time Hollywood uses some idiotic plot device just to do something tear-jerking, the heart of creativity dies a little more.  Tom didn't seem to have a problem ripping open the rest of them now, did he?  A REAL Fed Ex man would have kept them all!  (Sh'yeah...and pigs might fly outta my butt!)Bottom Line:  Unless you're a Tom Hanks fanatic, don't waste your time.  And if you are, broaden your horizons for pity's sake.  Watch something else. This movie is just another excuse for rich people to get richer.",6,0,1,14 November 2001
2001: A Space Odyssey," An allegorical space opera masterpiece.
","Good Points:  Absolutely everything.  The lovely mating of Arthur C. Clarke's story with (da Man) Stanley Kubrick's directing gives birth to a classic film with a life all its own.  And here we have an interesting case of 'nobody got it, but in a COOL way.'  The meaning behind 2001: A Space Odyssey has been debated since the day it first hit the screen, and this is, without argument, part of its charm.  Clarke and Kubrick take the road less travelled and refuse to spell it out for us.  If asked what it means, no doubt they would with a steely gaze reply, 'What do YOU think it means?' Absolutely fantastic film in every way.Bad Points:  The only complaint I have about this movie is Kubrick's penchant for stretching things out.  Usually it's appropriate and well-placed, but sometimes not.  I think most would agree that sitting there watching spaceships flit about to classical music is neat for the first three minutes, tiresome by the seventh, and downright boring by the tenth. And if we were going to be forced to watch every move Frank made getting to the A.E.35 unit, could we at least hear something besides that annoying hiss?  Don't get me wrong.  I love Kubrick's work and the man is a genius. But even genuises do something stupid now and again.Bottom Line: 2001 is one of the finest movies we hairless apes have ever made.  The fact that it was made in 1968 only serves to further astound the viewer.  Fantastic story.  Masterful directing.  This is what filmmaking is all about, people.  Watch it or die.",9,2,4,13 November 2001
The Matrix," Pretty good movie, but overrated.
","Good Points:  First and foremost, the concept.  A lot of people will think it's a new one, but actually this kind of thing has been written about before in sci-fi novels and short stories for a long time.  But for the movies, it is a unique plot.  Most average people were probably still trying to wrap their brains around the story weeks after they'd left the theater. And, of course, lotsa brownie points for feeding our brains with yet more mind-boggling special FX goodies and well-choreographed butt-kicking.  The cast, except for Reeves, did well, and special thumbs-up to the peformances of Lawrence Fishburne and Joe Pantoliano.Bad Points:  Sorry folks, but any movie with Keanu Reeves in it automatically gets docked a few.  Yea, he's cute, and probably a nice guy. But, 'Bill and Ted' movies aside, he can't act.  Plain and simple.  Also, the movie depended too much on eye candy and the directing was way too Hollywood-ized.  What could have been truly epic was given the 'Let's Give The Public What They Want' treatment and turned into little more than an excuse for a lot of fight scenes and instant-gratification visuals which, while impressive, don't lend much to the real substance of the movie.  And to tell you the truth, this whole 'Chosen One' crap is getting a little old. Let's come up with some other excuse, okay people?  This plot device should have been replaced a long time ago.Bottom Line: In spite of the flaws, a good movie.  Won't go down in history with classics like Star Wars and Blade Runner, but worth watching.",7,0,1,13 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Sci-Fi classic, one of the best ever made.
","Good Points: Truly a classic and, for its time, ground-breaking movie, Star Wars is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made.  Even today the original movie, which is now actually Episode IV of course, holds up pretty well, even in the special FX department.  When you realize that Star Wars has been around for twenty-five years and Lucas can STILL pack a theater, all one can do is kow-tow to one of the gods of Sci-Fi. Bad Points: About the original movie, there is little to complain about. What few complaints one could conjure are due simply to the fact that the movie is so old.  But all things considered including age, the only complaint I have is that its very typical in a lot of ways.  With the exception of Princess Leia, all the main characters are men.  Surely a technologically advanced society would also have moved forward in a social way as well, meaning more women in positions of authority.  This is prevalent throughout the Star Wars series.  Also, Lucas's directing was a bit banal.  It was okay, but nothing spectacular.  Someone like Stanley Kubrick would have made the movie absolutely immortal.Bottom Line:  The bad points are very minor ones.  Overall, anyone who says that Star Wars isn't a fantastic film doesn't know what the heck they're talking about and you should lend no weight to their opinion.",8,1,2,12 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Excellent movie, and the best of the Star Wars series.
","Good Points:  Everything that made the first Star Wars movie great is in abundance in Empire Strikes Back.  The mood is darker than the first film and not quite so fairy-tale-ish, and it's nice to see the good guys get their butts kicked for a change.  Also, here the characters develop further than in the first film which shows that Lucas was pacing things nicely for what was to become a trilogy.  And who could ignore the special effects? Those wizards of eye candy, Industrial Light and Magic, which formed out of the first movie, deliver some incredible visuals that are still fun to watch even today.Bad Points:  Very little to complain about here.  Honestly, I can't think of a single thing I didn't like about the movie.Bottom Line:  A great sci-fi classic just like the first one.  If you liked A New Hope, you'll love Empire.",9,0,0,14 November 2001
