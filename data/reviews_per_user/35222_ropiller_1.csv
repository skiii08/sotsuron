Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Weak Coctail with poor taste
","The makers of this movie obviously were only up to produce another blockbuster without any message.The plot clearly is a cocktail of stolen ideas from actually hip and successful blockbusters as Twilight, From Dusk Til Dawn, Django Unchained, etc. but mixing up too many flavors without selection ends up with a very poor taste as this movie clearly shows.When I think of the potential this story had provided, if the vampires of the south would have been more a synonym than 'real', this movie is not only worth a single star. Only the 3D effects, picture and action scenes made me give 3 stars for this idiotic botch.The way it is, it shows Abe Lincolns talents more an axe swinging madman than the brilliant thinker and speaker he really was. If the modern US had been founded on a guy as shown in this movie, what a poor nation would it be? To me it's no surprise that no really good actor obviously wanted to part in this movie, why the set is filled with rather no-names that act as such.Even if I had only want to spend an entertaining afternoon with a movie that does not need me to activate my brain cells, there would have been many better choices. Definitvely not a movie I have to watch again...",3,3,5,2 March 2015
