Angels & Demons," Well... So much for Angels And Demons
","To start off with... I haven't read The Da Vinci Code nor Angels And Demons. This review is only made from watching the films. I'm what you might call: Not a reader. I prefer the visuals instead.I remember when I first watched TDVC it was kind of long and boresome. After I got it on DVD and watched it a couple more times, it hooked me. Especially the scene with Hanks and McKellen discussing, over a cup of tea, how the gospels came to life. I very much like their argumentations for and against their validity into the Bible.Sadly we don't see any kind of this in AAD. The movie is driven by the action quite a bit, and do not dwell at any time in longer discussions or something close to that.TDVC have been watched a great many times, where as AAD will more be like a part of the DVD-collection. To be dusted off and watched occasionally Don't get me wrong though. The scale of the movie is grand. But it feels more like a tourist-attraction to come see the Vatican and Italy's churches rather than to tell a good story.McGregor is almost always awesome in whatever role he plays. But he alone can't carry the weight of this much anticipated movie on his shoulders.I do have to comment that 2 distinguished gentlemen from Denmark played a role in this movie too. Kaas as the assassin and Lindhardt as the Vatican police officer/keeper of the Vatican library (Note his awkward interpretation of the English language even though he's portrayed as a German, or something like that). Sorry... But he don't quite pull this off, though a great danish actor. Kaas on the other hand I liked very much in his role. If You haven't figured it out yet... Yeah I'm a dane too. lol I like action very much. But to me, it's kind of misplaced here to a certain degree. When You know the story of TDVC and how it plays out, then AAD disappoints me because we don't dwell too much on any given thing in this movie.A good work-out action-piece is my vote on this one. Would at any given time prefer to watch TDVC.",5,0,0,16 January 2010
The Descent," Loved this one
","This movie had been sitting on my shelf for months without being wieved at all. Call me conservative when it comes to horror-flicks, but I tend to stick with the ones that hit it big in commercials and cinemas. Have got about 400 movies to choose from (Various genres), and couldn't decide which one to watch one evening. So took this one down the shelf, as one of my movies I hadn't watched yet. Have to say that I didn't have great expectations plus it sounded as a cheap B-movie from what you can read from the cover. But that changed. The first about 40 minutes builds up the story, but then it slowly starts to win in on you, and the pace of the story quickens up from there. I was pleasantly surprised of the twists and turns that came up during the movie - without revealing anything or too much (I hope). Get this one in your DVD-player and be entertained. Can only recommend you watch this in a dark room with NO lights on and plenty of surround-sound. SERIOUSLY. Enjoy and be scared",8,1,3,17 November 2007
300," Watch THIS
","I watched this epic movie in the theatres with a lady-friend of mine WITHOUT ANY expectations at all. She's An horror addict and I'm an action-addict. Did check up on it AKA trailers and whatnot, but couldn't decide what to mean about it. Both of us hadn't any expectations other than we thought it would be 2 hours of entertainment. But when the movie started I was literally hooked from the first scene until the last and so were she. It literally BLEW me away. I, up to this point, considered Gladiator and then Troy to be the best movies in this historic-genre until the day I layed my eyes on this flick. No, it's not historical accurate at all. All of these kinds of movies has some added dramatization (in some kind of way), whether you like it or not. It's Frank Miller's interpretation of the battle of the brave 300 Spartans. I haven't read/watched his cartoon, but that doesn't matter. Robert Rodriguez Did SOOOOOOOOO GOOD with his (Frank Miller) Sin City. What a cult flick if you ask me. 300 came out of the same kind of dust. Sure it isn't a movie for the person that looks for what's wrong in the storyline or what's accurate. Take it as it is. An epic action story that also deals with matters of the heart (Seen from the Spartans wiev). I personally couldn't wait 'till it got out on DVD. 2 months before this got released on DVD, I got hold of a documentary called 'Spartans: The Last Stand Of The 300'. Check it out if you wanna know THE true historic battle. The day of release? You betcha I was there to get hold of the 2-disc Special Edition. I don't EVEN care about any goofs and whatnot. This movie HAS gotta be the best of 2007. Both cinema- and ALSO DVD-wise. If you don't like a lot of action and blood, then don't get this one. To ALL of you OTHERS.... GET IT!!! And GET IT NOW...........",10,1,4,17 November 2007
