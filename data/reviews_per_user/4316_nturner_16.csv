Stop-Loss," Denunciation and Tribute
","I was a young adult during the Viet Nam era and by only a stroke of fate was not submitted to that carnage. Of course, during the 1960's, there was a draft and every young man was subject to being sent off to die at the whim of government officials.The trauma to the protagonist in Stop-Loss can be likened to that of a young man drafted into battle in Viet Nam. The difference is this contemporary tale relays that the young man in question, Brandon, had volunteered to serve in the military and completed a tour of duty in war-torn Iraq with honors and along with his buddies with whom he enlisted arrives in his Texas hometown to a hero's welcome. He has had enough of war and is elated to be able to return to his civilian life and put the horrors of war behind him.Brandon then finds that he has been stop-lossed - the fate of some eighty-one thousand soldiers thus far during the past five years - and is ordered to return to battle in Iraq. He flies into a rage and verbally assaults his commanding officer. As a result, he is ordered to the stockade until time to be redeployed. On his way to the stockade, he overpowers his guards, escapes, and goes AWOL.Thus begins a quest to favorably resolve his situation by seeking out the senator who has told the conquering hero that he is available for help and counsel. Through a twist of fate, he is aided in his flight by the fiancé of his best friend with whom he had served in Iraq.The young men depicted in Stop-Loss are surely not what one would call refined. They hail from the lower class of a small, Texas town and - had they not enlisted - would probably have had some sort of dead-end job. The armed forces offered them a profession and guidance. Unfortunately, it also offered death, horror, disfigurement, and post traumatic stress. These men are lost in their former world and exhibit negative reactions to it such as drunkenness, fighting, acts of civil violence, and combative attitudes toward the women in their lives. These men have allowed their narrow-minded attitude of macho to practically destroy their lives. Add that macho attitude to the indescribable visions of war in their minds, and you have an explosive situation.The actors in this film perform an impressive job at giving the viewer a believable look at these young men and women.Ryan Phillippe as Brandon is a perfect as the former macho jerk who has established himself as a leader who is maturing into a thinking, reasoning man.Joseph Gordon-Levitt masters another edgy role as a man so dependent upon army life that he is unable to function as a civilian.Channing Tatum is affecting in the role of Brandon's lifetime best friend who not only is suffering post traumatic stress but is unable to come to terms with the actions of his buddy.Victor Rasuk gives a heartbreaking performance as the lover boy of the group who is horribly disfigured and wounded in battle. His performance is a tribute to all of the real soldiers who return from war and defeat seemingly insurmountable odds.Abbie Cornish portrays Jeanie, an admirable woman who is the fiancé of Brandon's best friend and his support during his flight. Cornish gives us a sexy woman who is tough and not about to be done in by fate and the idiotic actions of the men in her life.Needless-to-say, this film is a denunciation of the war and the stop-loss policy, but it is also a tribute to the young soldiers who go off to Iraq thinking that they are doing something good for their country. It's a very good film with a big heart and worthy viewing for any citizen.",8,1,3,7 November 2008
United 93," Sobering Look at Real Heros
","I added this film to my video service queue with trepidation because I tend to shy away from films that exploit real-life tragedies, but it got such good reviews during the time it was in the theaters that I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad that I did because it is truly a rewarding experience.To me, the events of 9/11 continue to be somewhat surreal in my mind. I sometimes have to remind myself that I, indeed, did see those two towers collapsing on television and think that just a few miles from my home, the Pentagon was laid waste by another attack. But the event of that day that has always been paramount in my mind was what took place in that airplane somewhere above Pennsylvania. That horrible day was surely not lacking in heroes, but those few ordinary people on that plane became, probably, the most extraordinary heroes of the day.The film is extremely well done in that it does not contain any of those standard Hollywood elements normally associated with films of this sort. Instead, the viewer is given a close-up view of the events in the plane, at aviation tracking stations, and at military headquarters. As a viewer, you feel you are actually there observing the events as they happen.The depiction of the hijackers reminded me of Paradise Now in that they are not evil devils but simply young men who have been brainwashed in order to carry out a mission of evil and destruction.For those who rent or by the DVD there is a worthwhile documentary on the disc. It is an hour long and shows some of the actors in the film meeting the family members of the people they portrayed. What the family members have to say, and their lives since the time of the event are engrossing.This film is very worthwhile viewing that gives further insight into an historical event that will be discussed and debated for many years to come.",10,3,6,9 November 2008
In Bruges," Tongue-In-Cheek Treat
","Bruges is a city in Belgium that has most of its medieval architecture intact, and it serves as a character in this film much as New York City, London, of Los Angeles often serve as characters in many films. In Bruges is a dark and very bloody comedy in which the city of Bruges adds its own somewhat bizarre background. Bruges is not of our everyday world just as the events in the film are surely not daily experiences.Ray is a novice hit man who on his very first job, accidentally kills a young boy. Ray is sent to Bruges with an older hit man, Ken by their boss, Harry. The reason given to Ray by Harry is so he can basically get his head together after his horrifying mistake. The real reason is that Ray has been sent to Bruges to be murdered by Ken. At the beginning, Ken only suspects this assignment until he is contacted by Harry.The older, wiser, more sophisticated Ken is overwhelmed by the history, art, and beauty of Bruges whereas the young and crude Ray hates being stuck in this little city so far removed from modern times. As their visit continues, Ken endeavors to interest Ray in the sights and knowledge available, but Ray, who is wracked with guild over murdering a young boy, only wants to drown his remorse with drink, drugs and the companionship of a newfound local girl.Eventually, Ken receives the phone call he has been dreading in the back of his mind. Harry orders that Ray be murdered because, 'You can't kill a kid and live.' All of this leads to an extremely bloody ending, but along the way, the audience is treated to a string of bizarre characters and even more bizarre events that are filled with delightful dark, dark element of comedy.Along with the tight darkly humorous script, the superior acting - especially the acting of the three male leads - is what gives In Bruges its eight stars.Brendan Gleeson plays Ken and his beautifully understated depiction of a man worn down by his own sins who just wants to survive is a sight to see. It would seem impossible to feel any sympathy for a man who murders for his profession, but Gleeson gives us such a man.Colin Farrell at thirty-two is ten years too young for the part of Ray, but his considerable acting talent enables you to forgive those extra years. He makes you believe he is Ray, a young man from the wrong side of the tracks who has accidentally committed an unpardonable sin and is suffering in his soul.Ralph Fiennes may be a little over the top as Harry, the boss, but he certainly pulls it off. Keep in mind that these are unreal people in an unreal environment, so a little overacting can certainly be forgiven.These three stars of the film are supported by a group of premier actors in series of extremely unusual roles.As for the DVD, the extra features are a real treat. Not only is there a very good 'making of' video, there is a beautiful tour of Bruges. The delight of the extras, however, is a short video based upon the considerable foul language in the film which would make a sailor blush. This f**king little video is fun, fun.Yes, In Bruges is dark and bloody. If you shy away from such fare, avoid this film, but if you can plant your tongue firmly in your cheek and sit back to enjoy a flight of sinister fancy, give this film a viewing.",8,0,2,7 November 2008
Brokeback Mountain," Comparing Brokeback Mountain and Making Love
","When I first began to read and hear the hoopla about Brokeback Mountain, an oft heard comment that struck me was that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were to be congratulated for assuming the parts of two gay men and having scenes of love making. There were also indications that this was a first in a major production. I remember having seen Making Love in 1983 in which Michael Ontkean and Harry Hamlin (two well-known stars of the time) had several love scenes. This was ground-breaking stuff for the time, so Ledger and Gyllenhaal were not the 'originals' as so often depicted.One can't justifiably make a comparison of the two films. Brokeback Mountain is a superior film with a sobering message that can easily be applied to a universality of relationships while Making Love is a somewhat Pollyanna view of a more specific relationship of a gay man coming out to his wife. Perhaps the happier, more resolved ending of Making Love comes from the difference in time periods of the two films. The events in Brokeback Mountain take place twenty years earlier than the events in Making Love, and the political and social attitude toward gay persons matured considerably between 1963 and 1983.I believe, however, that the characters and effective performances of the four lead actors should be examined. Without considering the time differential, the lifestyles and backgrounds of the leading characters make a difference in the way they were depicted and the eventual outcomes of their relationships. Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal) play two working class guys totally immersed in a macho homophobic world whereas Zack (Ontkean) and Bart (Hamlin) play two college educated professionals living in a sophisticated environment. Even though these pairs of characters spring from two different time periods and cultures, there is a striking similarity between their emotional interaction. Jack and Zack are more open, more willing to further the relationship while Ennis and Bart are fearful of full expression of the love each feels for his partner. All four actors give impressive and totally believable performances that give the viewer full insight into the emotional trials of the men. These performances make viewing both films an enlightening experience.As stated earlier, Brokeback Mountain is all-in-all a far superior film when compared to Making Love, but I recommend also viewing the latter for a realistic portrayal of two men facing life changing emotional incidents.",Null,3,4,9 November 2008
Match Point," An Allen Character in Disguise?
","A talented young Irish tennis professional moves to London and obtains a position at an exclusive tennis club, makes friends with a wealthy member, becomes romantically involved with the member's sister, and then becomes sexually involved with the member's fiancé. The story in nothing new, but it is written and produced with great panache by Woody Allen.Roger Ebert in his review says, 'often he uses a Woody Figure (preferably played by himself) as the hero. Match Point contains no one like Woody Allen ' I find that statement ironic for, as I watched the film, I was thinking that the main character - skillfully played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - is a Woody Allen hero. The only difference is that, in most of Allen's films, the lead character is a somewhat neurotic Jewish man lost in a world of Gentiles whereas in Match Point, the lead character is a somewhat neurotic poor Irishman lost in a world of Englishmen. None-the-less, Jonathan Rhys Meyers is perfect for the part of Chris Wilton in the film because he has the ability to appear in many different guises from an innocent boy-like man to the incarnation of pure evil, and the complex character of Wilton offers that full range to the actor. Meyers' acting and Allen's writing and direction keeps you wandering as to the fate of this character all the way to the end of the film.Scarlett Johansson plays Nola Rice, the object of Chris Wilton's adulterous desire, and she is beautiful in both physical appearance and acting skill in the part. Again, we are shown a person whose diverse emotions make her seem a different person at various times in the film.Most of us wear our masks and adjust our behaviors according to our needs and the situation, but the characters in Match Point - particularly the two major characters - have honed that skill to absolute perfection. As Mr. Ebert also states, 'each and every character is rotten' I didn't find them all totally rotten - some are just a little on the gamey side. Without likable or admirable characters, the captivation and brilliance of the film is that Woody Allen has given us these people, shown us what they do, and then lets us see the realistic - not moralistic - results.",9,1,2,9 November 2008
Gone Baby Gone," The Affleck brothers are a powerhouse of talent.
","Casey Affleck is nominated for best supporting actor in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; the results of which will be known within a week of the writing of this review. Affleck will probably not win, but he certainly deserves the nomination. In my mind, he is the star of The Assassination... - a film I did not enjoy even though the acting and the production values were superior. In my mind, if you want to see Casey Affleck at his very best thus far, watch Gone Baby Gone.Gone Baby Gone is a gritty morality tale directed and co-authored by Casey's more famous brother, Ben. It is one of four novels know as the Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro mysteries written by Dennis Lehane. The story takes place in a working-class neighborhood of Boston where there is nothing glamorous - drugs and crime seem to reign supreme in this place where the residents eke out meager subsistence. Kenzie and Gennaro are asked by the relatives of a missing girl to take up the search as they feel that the police are not doing their best efforts.The missing girl's mother, Helene McCready, is an addicted slattern who doesn't seem worthy of motherhood or, for that matter, any modicum of human sympathy. In the part of McCready is Amy Ryan who is nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress. Ryan surely deserves the nomination for she gives us a character whom we must certainly hate, but for whom we feel sympathy. Ryan is really good in this part.As the investigation proceeds there are many twists and turns - none of which I'll relate in fear of spoiling the film for anyone who has not yet seen it. In the end, it all comes down to a weighty moral decision that must be made by investigator Kenzie. I must admit that I do not agree with his decision, but the superior acting of Casey Affleck enables me to understand the choices made by Kenzie.These two Affleck brothers are a powerhouse of talent, and I am sure that their gifts to cinema will continue for many years to come. They both know the Boston neighborhood and the people who inhabit that space and bring nobility to persons who would most surely be considered ignoble by the majority of society.",9,0,0,7 November 2008
Burn After Reading," A Dark Romp
","This is a real kick of a movie. Ethan and Joel Coen are noted for their dark humor and absurd situations, and in this film, they give the audience a witty satire on the security community - throwing in a neat stab at the attitude of those who man the exercise centers of our country. Be aware that just about everyone in this film is a dolt, and if not a dolt, a bastard or a bitch. Throw self-centered security and exercise nuts together and shake - you get Burn After Reading.The basic plot is fairly simple - simple, that is, as the ultra creative Coens can make it. A security man has been forced out of his job and decides to write a tell-all memoir. His discontented wife is having an affair with another security man - a sex manic who seeks pleasure with every woman he meets. A disk containing some data for the memoir is found by a exercise consultant who thinks she needs extensive, very expensive plastic surgery in order to attract a man. She and her fellow worker decide to hold the disk for ransom in order to raise the money for the surgery. As I said, simple! Handled in the wrong way, this absurd plot would have been a silly, juvenile mess, but the Coens have taken this ludicrousness and made a highly entertaining romp. It is the directing and acting that bring this beautiful farce to its high altitude. Needless-to-say, the Coens are geniuses at this sort of thing, and they have a stable of super actors to bring their warped vision to fruition.John Malkovich plays the disillusioned security man on his way out. He's a drunk, and a surly drunk at that. He pretty much hates the world and wants everyone in it to suffer. Malkovich has the unique ability to play such a character and still make the audience feel a little sorry for him.Tilda Swinton plays Malkovich's bitch of a wife who is having an affair with the sex-crazy guy. She is a pediatrician who hates children. What more needs to be said? Swinton plays this cold woman to the hilt.George Clooney is the lover who can't get enough sex from anyone. Plus, he is probably the second biggest dolt in the film. Clooney is just great in this role - a real treat to watch.All of the acting is superior - including all supporting characters - but Brad Pitt absolutely steals the show as a not very bright fitness nut determined to help his friend finance her plastic surgery.That friend is played wonderfully by Frances McDormand. She has mastered the technique of making even the most outlandish character believable, and she certainly pulls out all the stops on this one.It is beyond my belief that a large number of critics did not like this film. I can only assume that they have completely lost their senses of humor and absurdity or never had them in the first place. Burn After Reading is an absurd delight created by super directing, a very witty script, and exceptional acting. I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't get one good chuckle after another from this one.",9,1,5,9 January 2009
The Lives of Others," A Vivid Reminder
","I begin this review by quoting Jesse Vint III. Mr. Vint is a character actor seen in numerous films and television programs. Of The Lives of Others, he states, 'This film slowly gripped me, but by the end, the grip was merciless.' I couldn't have said it better. That's why I am borrowing Mr. Vint's words. As a matter of fact, when I first started watching this film, I was thinking that it wasn't going to be worth over two hours of my time. I soon discovered that it is worth far more. It turned out to be a deeply personal experience for me as it reminded me of certain shattering events in my own life. I actually had nightmares last night relating to those events which, I'm sure, were aroused by viewing this extraordinary film set in East Germany a few years before the fall of The Wall.The element of the film that caused me to continue to watch even though I first thought that I was not going to be entertained was the depiction of the lead character, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler played by Ulrich Mühe. Mühe's interpretation of a man who appears totally devoid of emotion is hypnotic. The character Wiesler is an officer in the Stasi - the secret police in charge of following the movements and activities of every person the country.The Stasi employed some 100,000 people to keep track of some 16 million citizens. In addition, the Stasi had a huge network of unpaid informers reporting the activities of their friends and neighbors. Imagine - one person to spy upon and report the lives of just sixty people. Horrifying! Mühe is an actor who grew up in East Germany and was the victim of both the Stasi and 'friends' who were informers. That surely had to add to his insight into the character of Wiesler, but whatever his resources, his performance is surely one of the finest ever recorded on film. Wiesler is a man so imbued with Communistic doctrine and devotion to the state that he has become an observation and interviewing machine more than a man. There is a revealing scene early in the film in which Wiesler summons a prostitute to his house. He sits on his sofa with his shirt buttoned to the top, trousers and belt still fastened, while the prostitute plies her trade - machine sex. The only hint of any human emotion is at the end when he buries his head in her ponderous breasts. At this point in the film is when I began to feel sorry for this pitiful man rather than hate him for what he does.Wiesler is assigned to observe a famous playwright who has always openly supported the government - but why? We find that Wiesler's superior is having an affair with the lover of the playwright - a beautiful and famous stage actress - and wants the playwright out of the way. The motive behind the observation goes totally against the principles to which Wiesler has devoted his life and career. Thus we see a seed planted that will grow to change the life of this man. That change takes place as he observes the lives of others.Along with this totally breathtaking film, the DVD contains features which truly enrich the viewing experience. Through these features, the viewer is treated to the history of the research that went into the film, the writing process, the historic locations, and the thoughts of the actors. They are not to be missed.If you are reading this review, you probably have an interest in film. As a film viewer, you must see The Lives of Others.",10,4,6,8 November 2008
Across the Universe," A Joy from Beginning to End
","I'm not sure whether the younger generation will appreciate Across the Universe as much as I. You see, I'm from the time that songs told a story, you could actually understand the words the singer was singing, and songs had a tune rather that just shouting to a boom-de-de-boom-boom rhythm. Across the Universe is a musical that actually began with the songs - all those of the Beatles. There are the standards that are familiar to anyone not living in a cave for the past forty years, but not being an avid Beatle fan, there were songs that were new to me.All of this takes place in the Viet Nam War era. It certainly means a lot to me as I would have been the age of those young people in the movie. There is an extremely inventive segment in which young Max goes for his induction physical. That certainly brought back some memories for me - both haunting and humorous. The induction scene is witty and camp, and the director certainly zeroed in on all the indignities save one - the bend over and spread your cheeks part.The story of the film is simple - yet beautiful and romantic. Young Jude is a steelworker in Liverpool who travels to the United States on a personal quest. He meets Max who has just dropped out of college. Max invites Jude to Thanksgiving dinner at his family's home where Jude meets Lucy, a high school senior and Max's sister.Jude and Max go off to New York and find living quarters in The Village with a group of creative young people. In the meantime, Lucy's love who has gone off to Viet Nam is killed, and Lucy decides to spend the summer before college with her brother in The Village.Needless-to-say, Lucy and Jude fall in love, and the two spend an idyllic time loving, drugging, and working - he as an artist and she as a protester of the war.Max, as indicated previously, is drafted and is sent off to Viet Nam.The lives of these three and all of their friends are shown to the audience through those wonderful Beatle songs, extraordinary choreography, and impressive video effects. This movie is a joy from beginning to an end that comes too soon.One last personal note: 'Something' is my favorite song, and there is a scene in Across the Universe in which Jude sings 'Something' as he watches Lucy sleep and sketches her. Wow, did that bring back memories and stir my heartstrings! I hope that Across the Universe does the same for you.",10,1,2,7 November 2008
Green Street Hooligans," More Than Just A Sports Movie
","Hooligans is a very good sports movie but considerably more than just a sports movie. Elijah Wood plays Matt, a retiring, actually cowardly, Harvard student who is expelled just weeks before he is set to graduate because he is blamed for the possession of drugs that his roommate has hidden in his closet. Even though his father is a world-famous journalist who would have surely been able to save his college career, Matt chooses to slink away with his tail between his legs. He goes to England where his older sister lives with her husband and new baby. Matt's brother-in-law has a brother - Pete, play by Charlie Hunnam - who is a brute of a man. Through circumstance, Matt is given over to Pete's 'care' on his first evening in England.Pete takes Matt to the local pub where his football firm meets before each game. It seems that a football firm is just another name for a gang, but instead of using guns and knives as gangs do in the United States, the firm uses fists and blunt objects to enforce their territorial rights. There is a point made in the film by the members of the firm that they disdain the violence of gangs in the United States because - by using guns and knives - their encounters are not 'honorable.' They, instead, inflict 'honorable' injuries - broken bones, concussions, bruises, lacerations, etc. upon their rivals.The amazing fact about the members of the firm is that they are all 'upright' citizens holding down respectable jobs and nurturing families. Pete is depicted to be a caring teacher. But when it comes to football, these 'ordinary guys' turn into unbelievable monsters.Matt, who has spent his life thus far as a repressed academic, is totally bowled over and entranced by the excitement created by these men in the bar before and during the football game. After the game, Matt is attacked by members of another football firm. Pete and the rest of his firm show up and insist upon revenge. Matt, at first, just tries to get away, but then is drawn into the violence and comes to the realization that he is able to inflict punishment upon his rivals - a feeling totally new to him.Matt becomes a true member of the firm - much to the chagrin of his sister and brother-in-law. All of this plays out to expose complex relationships between Matt, his relatives, and the members of his own and a rival football firm that lead to tragic events.Hooligans might have been just your standard coming-of-age story had it not been immersed in the world of hooligans. A look at a fascinating, albeit scary, sub-culture, exciting sports scenes, excellent acting, and superior directing make this film much more that 'standard.'",8,0,0,9 November 2008
The World's Fastest Indian," Story of a New Zealand Legend
","It's been a while since I've seen a Reader's Digest, but I remember one of its standard features, 'My Most Unforgettable Character.' The hero of The Worlds Fastest Indian would most certainly be topic of that feature. Burt Munro was certainly a 'character' and is a New Zealand legend.The film is a dramatization of several months in the late 1960's of his extraordinary life in which he traveled to the Bonneville Salt Flats in order to attempt setting a land speed record for his 1920 Indian motorcycle.We begin by seeing Burt - played by Anthony Hopkins - working in his workshop on parts for his beloved Indian and soon discover that his workshop is actually his home - a shed on a suburban lot covered with overgrown weeds. The appearance of his shed and lot - plus the noise he makes at all hours with his motorcycle - are somewhat of an annoyance to his neighbor, but we soon learn that he appears to be universally liked in his community.Anthony Hopkins gives a more than excellent performance in portraying this man obsessed with his dream yet thoroughly likable, somewhat innocent, and a little more than randy. Yes, he basically is 'a dirty old man' but totally lovable in that guise.In addition to Hopkins' endearing representation, the whole movie has an easy feel of an earlier, more innocent time. All of the people that Burt meets in his quest are people we would also enjoy meeting. This makes the whole movie a viewing of easy pleasure.On the DVD, you are also treated to a lengthy documentary about the real Burt. Both the documentary and the film are a labor of love for director, Roger Donaldson, and that love shines on the screen.",10,1,2,9 November 2008
Glory Road," An Insightful Lesson in History
","All March Madness means to me is that I probably have to extend the recording time for 60 Minutes on my DVR because there will probably be some basketball game running overtime when the program is to start.Glory Road played the other night on a cable channel. I decided to watch it again, and it reminded me that you can even hate basketball - which I pretty much do - and still really enjoy this film. The actual game of basketball has very little to do with what makes Glory Road a must-see film - especially for the younger generations for this is a true story of how prejudice is overcome by principle and strong will.Those who do know of the basketball season depicted in Glory Road will know of Don Haskins who was the coach at Texas Western College (now the University of Texas at El Paso). Texas Western was one of the first southern colleges to integrate its sports teams, and the final championship game of the 1966 season was the first in which all starting players were Black.Haskins is depicted as a strong-willed man set upon his proved strategies as a coach who learns some new things from the cocky Black players recruited to bring life to a failing team. He is played by Josh Lucas who gives us a man who might look young and unsure on the outside but is strongly willed and principled. Haskins was thirty-five at the time of the game as was Lucas at the making of the film making him perfect for the part.Another strong, though short, performance in the film is by Jon Voight as Adolph Rupp, the opposing coach in the NCAA Championship game. Rupp was sixty-one at the time of the game and noted as one of the greatest coaches of all time. Voight's depiction of Rupp as a man of an earlier generation disdainful of a young coach breaking the rules and the color barrier is chilling.If you haven't had the opportunity to see Glory Road, I recommend a viewing for it is an inspirational sports story as well as an insightful lesson in history. If you have seen it, take some time from watching The Big Dance and watch it again.",8,0,0,7 November 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Not a Silly Comedy
","I have my niece to thank for my enjoyment of this film. I am not a fan of Will Ferrell. The previews I saw of this film on television made it look as though it was another of his comedies in the Will Ferrell style, so I had dismissed it and never considered seeing it. At a dinner, my niece told me that she and her husband had greatly enjoyed the film and assured me that it was not a typical Will Ferrell vehicle. Boy was she right! This is an excellent movie, and it has caused me to look at Ferrell in an entirely different way.It is the story of Harold Crick, a man stuck in the rut of all ruts as far as his life is concerned. He is an IRS agent who quietly goes through each day according to a regular schedule and never deviates from that schedule. One day he hears a voice in his head that is narrating his entire life. He, at first, dismisses the phenomenon, but when it starts to exactly describe events, he becomes concerned and seeks professional help.Supporting Ferrell's excellent, understated performance is a slew of superior supporting actors.An unrecognizable rotund and bearded Tom Hulce is the company shrink who is Harold's first stop. Hulce is perfect in portraying the square peg in IRS's round hole. He is a delight.Linda Hunt charms as the somewhat bemused psychiatrist who keeps insisting that if Harold is hearing a voice, he is schizophrenic. Harold insists that the voice is not telling him to do things but merely narrating. In a beautifully delivered line, Hunt states that his problem in not based in psychiatry and suggests that Harold consult an expert in literature.Dustin Hoffman shines as the literature professor who, at first, rejects Harold's appeal but then becomes intrigued. In his acting, Hoffman sometimes has the tendency to go a little over the top when playing somewhat quirky characters, but here his acting is restrained and perfect.Maggie Gyllenhaal is the woman who astounds Harold with her beauty, intelligence, and passion for life. His desire to know her better - along with the comments from the narrator - cause him to examine and change his life. Gyllenhaal deftly gives us a sexy, desirable woman filled with an independent spirit.The neurotic author with writer's block and her down-to-earth assistant sent in by the publisher to help get the book finished are played by Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah. What a combination! They are so good together. Thompson's character is a total mess dressed in rumpled clothing, twisting tissues to shreds, and staring vacantly with red, wild eyes. Latifah's character is always perfectly dressed and coiffed and is a picture of firm, yet compassionate, control.In the special features on the DVD, the actors laud the director for his low-keyed guidance. It is clear that viewers can thank Marc Forster for creating a film that might have been a mess and total farce, but is, instead, a witty, thoughtful examination of life.Also on the DVD, the creators explain about the GUI (graphics user interface) used in the film. For me and all you other non-geeks reading this review, look up at the top of your screen. All those buttons, etc. are GUI In the film GUI is imposed upon the screen to show how Harold deals with the outside world. He is obsessed with numbers and order and the GUI is perfect in showing his computer-like thinking patterns.If you haven't seen this film or had dismissed it as a silly comedy, I urge you to take the advice of my niece and see it. You won't be disappointed.",8,0,0,7 November 2008
Lord of War," Grip the Mind and Conscience
","The rise to power of an international arms dealer is the subject of Lord of War. The film follows Yuri Orlov from his youth on the streets of New York, where he first gets the idea of going into arms's sales, through a career of accumulating wealth, winning the woman of his dreams, and gaining the power to bend governments to his will. The story is said to be based upon actual events with the character of Yuri representing five major arms dealers.Nicolas Cage is the star of Lord of War, and I cannot think of many other living actors who could have taken this part and made it their own. He has an uncanny ability to portray a man without affectation yet exude powerful emotions of love, lust, guilt, and remorse. Cage narrates the film with his unique sardonic tone, and that narration is a perfect rendering of the message of the film: this is business -- big business -- and a few million innocent lives should never interfere with profit.That special tone in Cage's voice is so very effective in such lines as:'There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?'and'I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers.'Lines of this character and some humorous situations may cause viewers to see this as black comedy; however, the suffering caused by war depicted here is so graphic that humor has little standing. Nevertheless, movies are made to entertain, and this film's dark wit creates superior entertainment.Jared Leto, as Yuri's brother, effectively represents the decay that infects a person of conscience who becomes involved in the business of human destruction. He provides an interesting contrast to Yuri who is seemingly without emotion or conscience.Yuri's wife, beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan, shows us the love that might have been available to a man whose emotions had not shut him off from mankind.For the depiction of pure evil and avarice, Eamonn Walker and Sammi Rotibi are notable for their portrayals of an African despot and his son. Rotibi especially chills with a manner of a man who has, from birth, absolute power over the life and death of anyone within his range.Andrew Niccol's writing and direction have provided us with words that grip the mind and conscience and images that evoke both gentleness and horror. Lord of War should engage the interest and concern of a wide audience.",10,3,5,8 November 2008
The Good Shepherd," Three Hours of Enthralling Entertainment
","I was overwhelmed by the quality of this film. It is a fictional representation of the birth of the CIA and its first director, James Angleton. From the little I've read of Angleton, he was the poster child for paranoia, and Matt Damon does him justice in a superbly understated way.Damon plays Edward Bell Wilson who begins his career as the master of covert operations and misdirection as a young boy when he conceals the reasons for the suicide of his father. Edward shows some semblance of normalcy during his college years, but personal circumstances and his involvement in covert operations during World War II turns him into a nationalistic automaton. The United States of America is his true god and family, and even though he is a good man at heart, he is no real husband or father. Damon's often silent - never overt - acting paints a startling portrait of a complex man.The film is peppered with big stars, but John Turturro stands out as Wilson's right hand man. Turturro is chilling as the person who actually carries out most of the violence seen in the film. Wilson appears to be totally non-violent, and Turturro is his grimly capable Mr. Hyde.More that just a telling of the start of the notorious agency, this film is also a love story, a family tale, and a mystery. We are treated to views of the mystifying Skull and Bones society of Yale University. As a matter of fact it plays a big part throughout the film supporting the rumors that most high-ranking members of the CIA are also members of Skull and Bones. In the love story, we get a hint at what Wilson might have become had not circumstances conspired against him. And the family tale focuses upon the father-son relationships of three generations of the Wilson family. All of these are bound tightly around the real central character - the CIA.I have read several reviews that compare this film with The Godfather, and it certainly has many of its excellent qualities. Its production values are top quality, all of the acting is far above average, and Robert De Niro skillfully heads up the whole thing to give the viewer nearly three hours of enthralling entertainment.",10,2,3,8 November 2008
The Pursuit of Happyness," An Excellent Film Made Better by Watching It at Home
","I have a running debate with friends and family as to whether it is better to watch a film in the theater or at home. I almost never go to movies in theaters because they cost a small fortune, and I am usually beset by some rude person or persons who spoil my enjoyment of the film.The Pursuit of Happiness is another positive to my side of the discussion because of the extra features available on the DVD.The story is of the real Chris Gardner who overcame great obstacles in order to become a successful multi-millionaire. All the while following through with his pledge to be a good father - not absent as was his own. I have seen Chris Gardner in a number of interviews on television. He is a dynamic personality who has achieved phenomenal accomplishments. Therefore, this unbelievable story is really true.Will Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Chris Gardner, and he certainly deserves the acknowledgment. But, in my mind, he deserves even more acknowledgment for giving his star power for this project that would have probably been overlooked by the Hollywood powers-that-be.The first thing that Smith did - as co-producer of the film - was to hand pick Italian director Gabriele Muccino. Smith had seen two of his films and was entranced by Muccino's ability to project real human feelings to the screen. He was certainly right because the director shows us real people and real emotions in every character.I read the thoughts of one reviewer who thought that this film suffered from the fact that it had a big budget - because of Will Smith's star power - and would have been better as a low-budget independent film. He makes the statement that the homeless extras in the film look too slick to really be homeless. The irony is that the homeless characters in the film were really homeless people hired to perform in the film. He would have done well to investigate the actual production of the film.Because of the big budget, the viewer is treated to the real locations in the life of Chris Gardner. This is something that could not have been accomplished in a film with a lower budget.In the DVD extras, the director states - this was for me, an enlightening theory. He says that the American Dream is not fully understood by citizens of the United States, therefore he, as an Italian, can better express the full ramifications of what the American Dream actually is. In other words, the American Dream is a reality and it is available for anyone who seeks its promise. Considering the state of our country today, those are certainly encouraging words.Here, I hark back to my opening paragraphs. This is an excellent film made even better by watching it at home and enjoying the extra features available on the DVD.",8,0,1,8 November 2008
