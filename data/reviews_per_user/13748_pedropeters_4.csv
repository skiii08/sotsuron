Minority Report," A great addition to the science fiction cannon.
","Minority Report takes place in 2054 and concerns a group of police force which are equipped with the capability to foresee a crime about to happen with the help of three mutated humans called 'precogs'. Unfortunately for John Anderton (Tom Cruise) as he sets up to work on the next crime about to happen he is horrified to see that the offender is he himself. What follows is a cat and mouse hunt which involves his entire corporation and then some. The visual effects are amazing, and the tone of the film is finely balanced between dreary, rainy grey and futuristic blue. Cruise and Colin Farrell star. Great movie.",Null,0,0,17 September 2018
21 Jump Street," Watch it even if you're not a fan of the TV show.
",21 Jump Street is easy enough to appeal to folks new to the material but it lacks the punches of a pure R rated film(this one is PG). Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play opposite personalities in that Hill is a geek and Tatum is a stud- who are assigned as partners as they go undercover at a high school to find some drug activities that lead to something bigger. There are enough laughs and yes- Depp has a cameo which should excite older fans and the film is basically a satire of the 80s in many ways. If you want a good film to sit down with for a throwback to the 80s than 21 Jump Street should be a great option. 7,Null,1,2,16 October 2018

Dog Day Afternoon," A meditative take on a famous novel.
","This is a classic of 70s cinema. Dog Day Afternoon, directed by the late great Sidney Lumet features a fine turn by the then fresh Al Pacino who plays a callow youth robbing a bank. The pacing is fantastic, there are many political underlying themes(the lower class's revolt, transgenderism) and it came out at a time when there was much disconcert on the streets of America. It is truly a great film and its reputation has only increased with time. Watch this one. 8/10 (Watch it for Lumet's crisp direction and Pacino's acting). Solaris (1971): Stanislaw Lem's Solaris is a highly regarded book and Andrei Tarkovsky's film adaption is pretty much spot on, though Tarkovsky being an auteur brings his own touch to the proceedings. The story is about a cosmonaut who is sent to a space station revolving around a mysterious planet in the future. The cinematography and production design are haunting- the spaceship is so different than what we usually see in Hollywood. The acting is restraint and works here. Some people have said there is a sense of pretentiousness and rightfully so as some scenes go on way too long. But hey, this is Tarkovsky we speak of. This is one of the finest hard science fiction films and you should see it at any cost.",Null,0,0,20 November 2018
