Blade Runner 2049," blade runner re visited
",Excellent film though the running time is a touch too long. it recaptures the atmosphere of ridley scott s original classic. ryan gosling is excellently detached until the truth becomes more apparent. to me it is engrossing and successfully attempts to tie the knots of phillip dick s compelling vision. the question of new life was always at the forefront of both these intruiging films,8,0,4,13 April 2020
