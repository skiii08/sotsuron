The Blair Witch Project," 'I don't know what's wrong with the people who didn't like this film. It's far more inventive than any run of the mill horror film that's come out in the past several years' EXCUSE ME but i beg to
","yes cus a bunch of young people getting lost in the woods and killed, is real original... B.W.P is nothing more then a cheap rip off of like 10 other horror movies, and its not even that well made... When i first saw it, i thought well its an intresting movie but the more i think about it well it just gets dumber and dumber, the movie is just not well made, bad diolog, and bad acting kills this movie... And i think they tried to hard to make it look real, and forgot a simple thing in story telling, which is making it intresting... this movie stunk up the place...",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Greatest Movie Ever??? I think so...
","The plot of the movie i won't go into detail, but in not so may words, the movie, is F%#&ing awesome, the special FX's are the best i have seen in my life. No movie has ever been captured, with such beauty, and elegance, from the sets to the c.g.i, to the fighting scenes. It's incredible Lucas has created a masterpeice, i heard some bad reviews, and to those who gave it bad reviews shame on you for missing the point... This movie has humor, FX's, Action, and the beginning of a love story which i believe, will be the best ever set on film. The old saying when lucas came out with A.N.H was, 'they don't make movies like this' what i say is they should make more movies like this. Unlike the other great movie of the year, and probably the best movie of the year, till T.P.M came out of course 'the matrix', T.P.M, has more eye candy, and humor to hold you in your seats, and believe me i was hook't to the screen, i mean i had to use the rest room for like an hour during the movie, and did not go cus i did'nt want to miss out on anything. I'm so glad i didnt use the rest room. =0) Lucas has combined what i believe is some of the coolest looking characters in films history, and the casting of Liam Neeson as QUI GON JIN was perfect, i believe he has played the role he was born to play. And as for Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan Kenobi, i have been a fan of his since trainspotting, and was ecstatic when i heard he was casted for this movie, and i think he is as perfect to play the role of Obi Wan Kenobi i think he pulls it off really well, especially the fight scene. But he was not the main jedi knight in it, and probably will have more screen presence in episode 2. As for Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala she was good in it, and she looks great in it, she is becoming a very beautiful woman, so i think she is also perfect for this movie, and she did a good job in it, so it works out fine. There is tho something about the film that botherd me well two things in fact, one that Darth Maul does not come out more in the movie, i have become his biggest fan, he looks so damn cool in that make up, and that double lightsaber is to die for... I hope some how someway he is back in episode 2, even tho he had something happen to him, which i won't say cus i don't want to give anything at all away, i want people to see this movie for them self's... But needless to say he is the best looking, character in the movie, he looks evil and by just looking at him, you can tell what he is all about, he is one hell of a character, like i said i want more maul, this is where i beg i guess, i know the chances of mr lucas seeing this review is slim to none, but in case he does see it, here is what i have to say, please please please, have maul back in episode 2, i mean i know millions of people would be blown away if he is back, and in more of the movie. I know i'll be happy to see him again... I mean the times he is on the screen i was jumping up and down on my seat on the edge almost screaming. Now to the second problem i had with the movie, simply put it was too short, i think it could have been another half hour long, so that we could have seen A: more maul, B: more of Liam Neeson C: more of the queens, building relationship with Anakin Skywalker, speaking of who i thought young  Jake Lloyd was not great but not bad in it, he did a good job considering he is a kid, and all, i think he has a great future in the buisness... But getting back to my second problem with the movie, yes i would have like't it to be longer, for those reasons. But the good thing in all this, is that there is yet another one coming out in 2 years, so mr lucas can get all the info from us the fans, and see what we like, and dont like, so that he can shape the next one to fit the demand of the fans... I know what my demad is 'MORE MAUL'.  =0) In all from a scale of 1 - 10 this movie is an 11, i mean you add everything in and you cannot do anything but marvel at how well made this movie is, and now i know lucas has had 20 plus to make this scrip't come to life, but still i think he has out done himself, i mean out of all the STAR WARS movies, this is without a doubt the best one, hands down, and i love the old trilogy mind you, i like them a lot but this movie is just incredible, i have seen it twice now, and plan on seeing it again like 30 more times, before the years over, so mr lucas you get an A+ from me, good luck on episode 2... And May The Force Be With You!!!",10,0,0,27 May 1999
Man on the Moon," One great movie, and one great star...
","If you ask me Jim Carrey is the best actor in a movie for last year, he did the best performance of all the movies which came out, yes spacy was good in american beauty, but no-one can touch jim carreys heartfelt performance in this movie, the academy awards keep screwing it up, i mean how dare they not nominate jim, he deserved it, and he is the rightful winner I am on strike against them i will not watch those academy award shows ever again, unless till they recognize the outstanding performance that jim gave, i dont care how they do it... jim is one hell of a comedian but you know what he is even a better actor, and in this movie he not only played the part he became the man, he infused himself into kauffman's world, and into his mind, and the end results were a true masterpiece of a movie, which is sad that more people didnt go to see... the fans missed out on a truly great movie...",Null,0,0,20 May 2000
