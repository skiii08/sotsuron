Alien 3," I like this movie...
","Alien 3 is one of the darkest, most morbid movies I have ever seen. It took a while for me to respect this film, (I hated it when I first saw it in '92), but I like it now. The acting by Weaver, Charles Dance and the entire prison cast is first rate, the dank and dirty sets of the Fiorina 'Fury' 161 prison colony are inventive and the surrealistic dark dreamlike mood of the film has a strong resonnating effect; (a funeral scene about 20 minutes into the movie intercut with the birthing process of the new alien is powerfully haunting and effective). I guess my only serious complaint with this film is that the special effects, especially the creature effects, aren't quite up to quality standards. Not as good as the first two, 'Alien 3' is definitely better than the fourth entry which should have found a better story and a better director.                           I give this film a B.",Null,0,3,13 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nooooooooooooooo!!!!!
","People waited in line for hours even days all around the world for THIS???? Mr. Lucas it's not the 70's and 80's anymore. This generation has different tastes than the one before us. This movie was so incredibly juvenile and silly that I couldn't help but sink in my theatre chair from embarrasment! Granted the first three films were silly and the acting was a little off but they were FUN! But I'll give credit where credit is due. Set design, costume design, creature makeup and certain other CGI effects were really terrific. Good job Mr. Lucas! But 'The Phantom Menace' suffers from mediocre acting, a so-so storyline and...and...........Jar Jar Binks??? Why do we need more comic relief? C-3PO and R2-D2 are more than enough. The look of Jar Jar was fine but his character should have mirrored the ferocity yet loyal friendship of Chewbacca. The film needed a darker and harder edge to appeal to those of us who grew up on the first 3 films but who also aren't kids anymore. (Remember 'The Empire Strikes Back'?). Great special effects aren't going to be enough for those of us who made it through the blockbuster filled 80's. We naysayers of this film want a great script, great acting, great characters etc. etc... Better luck next time George. When you make the next film, please keep in mind that not everyone who wants to see it will be six years old.                          I give this film a C-.",6,0,1,9 January 2000
Alien: Resurrection," You have got to be kidding me!
","The fourth chapter in the 'Alien' series is by far the worst in the bunch. After the lackluster success of the third film, I was expecting a major 'pick-me-up' for this one. Leaving the theatre that cold November night, I actually came to the conclusion that the third film was BETTER. The problem with 'Alien Resurrection' is that it doesn't feel like an 'Alien' film. I missed the Ellen Ripley from the first three films. She was a caring person; someone the audiences liked. In this film, she's a cold, steely I-don't-give-a-crap clone. The violence was horrific and the special effects weren't that impressive in my opinion. They should have gotten a real director for this film. Why not John ('Die Hard') McTiernan or Renny ( 'Cliffhanger') Harlin? The films few saving graces were the casting of Brad Doriff as one of the deceived scientists and Dominique Pinon, the wheel -chaired mechanic of 'The Betty'.
Stop the sequels please!",Null,2,3,11 September 1998
Blade," Incredibly gory!
","That's not to say I didn't like the film but good grief! 'Saving Private Ryan' wasn't this bad! Are they trying to go for some sort of record here? This is one of those films that I take guilty pleasure in enjoying despite the large amount of violence. Wesley Snipes could really use a hit and I think he may have one with this one.
No sequels please.",Null,0,1,10 September 1998
Armageddon," Keep the camera still!
","What's with the camera work in this film? It seem that Michael Bay is filming a rock video here. The camera is constantly moving from left to right, up and down and many times, the dialogue consists of people talking on top of one another. I understand Mr. Bay got his start in the music video business, but watching his spastic camera work for 2.5 hours made me dizzy. Despite all this however, I'm glad the film is doing well. I thought the disaster fad that Hollywood jumped on 2 years ago was fading but apparently not. 'Armageddon' is god-awful silly but a fun ride nevertheless.",8,1,1,10 September 1998
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Gives sci-fi a good name...
","'Empire' bypassed the cheerful adventurousness of the first film to where the forces of good suffer dearly and the ultimate force of evil in the film is discovered to have personal ties in the life of the hero. This is 'grown up' Star Wars and the best written. With the personal and relational battles we as human beings face in life, it's disheartening when evil triumphs over good and when the bad times outweigh the good ones. But that sort of thing is a reflection of how real life works sometimes. This film mirrors that fact effectively.                               I give this movie an A+.",Null,0,0,13 January 2000
