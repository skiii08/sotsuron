Mission: Impossible III," A thrill ride!
","J.J. Abrams adds his stamp of excitement and twists in his feature film directorial debut as he ups the ante in the third installment of Tom Cruise's 'Mission: Impossible' franchise. The film opens with Ethan Hunt rescuing one of the IMF agents (Keri Russell) who has been captured by enemy agents. Unfortunately, she is killed during the rescue and Hunt assembles a team to track down the villain (Philip Seymour Hoffman) responsible. When he escapes capture, he tries to take personal revenge on Hunt by kidnapping Hunt's new wife (Michelle Monaghan) as a threat and to ensure Hunt steals a weapon for him. Some excellent, well-publicized high tension stunts done by Cruise highlight much of the action sequences, which are top notch, as Hunt's team travels the globe from the Vatican to Shanghai in search of Hunt's wife and the 'Rabbit's Foot' weapon. A great thrill ride, and a sign of things to come for Abrams, putting him on the forefront of action films.",8,1,1,16 June 2015
Spider-Man 3," Not as bad as advertised
","Although the critics and some fans ripped this entry into the Spider-Man franchise as the worst of the Sam Raimi directed pictures, it's still an action packed entry as a superhero flick. Peter Parker thinks his life is good as his girl Mary Jane has gotten a part in a Broadway musical. However, his best friend, Harry Osborne is still hellbent on vengeance for the death of his father, the Green Goblin. A two-bit criminal, who has been discovered to be the REAL killer of Ben Parker gets exposed to a scientific experiment while trying to escape from the police, and his molecular structure has been changed to that of sand. In the meantime, while the city celebrates Spider-man, an alien symbiote crashes to earth and invades Peter's costume, creating an entity that brings out Spider-Man's dark side. When Peter rids himself of the costume, an ambitious photographer takes over the costume and becomes the entity Venom. It takes teaming with harry to defeat the Sandman and Venom. Although some of the action is far fetched, the action makes up for it.",7,4,4,20 June 2015
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," A more tongue-in-cheek sequel to Hellboy.
","Some references to the plot follow. In this sequel to the hit 'Hellboy', director Guillermo del Toro adds a little more humor to the mix as the team has to save the world from a paranormal Prince who is trying to summon the 'Golden Army' his people had created to get rid of mankind. The added humor makes it a breezy and enjoyable watch, despite not being as close to the tone of the source comic. The main players are back with Ron Perlman once again bringing the Dark Horse character to life. Hellboy is now known to humanity despite the efforts of bureau head Manning to keep his identity a secret. A new team leader, the gaseous Dr. Krausse is sent by Washington to keep an eye on Hellboy. While still having spats with Liz, he has to find a way to investigate and find the aforementioned Prince. An enjoyable 'popcorn' type flick.",6,0,0,9 June 2015
28 Weeks Later," A tenser sequel!
","'28 Days later' was a surprise hit when released, and though it didn't do as well at the box office, I feel its sequel '28 Weeks Later' is a much more action packed thriller than its predecessor. It is 6 months after the rage virus has swept through London. The city has been cleared of all infected victims, and is now starting to repopulate. However, when two children are reunited with their father, who survived an attack at a farmhouse, and seemingly saw his wife killed, they find their mom has also survived, and is an immune carrier of the virus. She inflicts the virus at the hospital where she's being treated, and hell breaks loose as a doctor tries to save the children from the onslaught of infected, since they might carry a cure in their bloodstream. A great turn by pre-'Hurt Locker' Jeremy Renner as an American soldier who tries to aid the escaping group, as well as Rose Byrne playing the sympathetic doctor. In my mind, much more action than the original movie, and the film keeps you on your seat's edge.",8,1,6,18 June 2015
Judgment at Nuremberg," An acting seminar...
","An all-star cast delivers top notch performances in Stanley Kramer's excellent courtroom drama, 'Judgement At Nuremburg'. Maximilian Schell is a revelation in his Oscar-winning turn as the defense counsel for four German judges being tried for war crimes during the Third Reich's reign in Germany.The judges are charged with handing out morally wrong convictions handed down to citizens who opposed the state, or were politically affiliated with parties who opposed the Nazis, and then passing cruel sentences to those citizens, which included women and children. Heinous punishments which included sentences to concentration camps, sterilization of citizens and mass executions are discussed at great length. Kramer gets superb performances out of Montgomery Cliff and the great Judy Garland, as broken victims of these verdicts. It includes messages of how the military establishment will continue to repeat mistakes of the past, as well as the message to the whole world that we should never forget the sins of war, whether it affects millions, or one human life. A powerful film, whose 3 hour length flies by as the drama grips you.",8,0,1,12 June 2015
Mission: Impossible," 60s Series Reborn On the Screen
","Tom Cruise stars in the rebirth of a 60s TV staple as he brings 'Mission: Impossible' to the big screen. The popular TV show is infused with new blood as we follow the trail of Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) as he is framed for the death of his team while on a mission.

Standout turns by Jean Reno and Ving Rhames as new members of his team, they look to find the 'mole' who has betrayed the Force as well try to find out who is looking to steal the list of identities of all the IMF agents. Brian DePalma directed this initial entry of the new film franchise, which was controversial upon its release due to its treatment of one of the original characters, Jim Phelps, played by Jon Voight. Although fans of the original TV series were up in arms, the film was still enjoyable, with enough intrigue and twists to keep viewers interested.",7,0,0,16 June 2015
A Hard Day's Night," A film that documents the greatest entertainment phenomenon in history.
","If anyone wants to witness the phenomenon that was 'Beatlemania' in the 1960s, all they have to do is view 'A Hard Day's Night'. Although it's a fictional account of two days in the life of the rock group on tour, it captures the essence of what their life on the road was actually like. It also served to enhance their 'personalities' as individuals, as well as show their spirit of fun-loving lads as a group. And as a bonus... the music throughout is superb! Sprinkled with Beatles' hits, Richard Lester's film almost serves as a blueprint for the music video form that took over the airwaves in the 1980s. Filmed with humor, great tunes and fast-paced editing, 'A Hard Day's Night' usually never fails in delivering smiles and pleasure. If you're a music fan, and a rock and roll buff, the film is a must!",10,39,48,24 October 2005
Munich," A story of vengeance.
","Based on the true events that followed the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes by Black September terrorists, 'Munich' covers the Israeli government's secret mission to exact justice and kill the terrorists responsible who escaped. Steven Spielberg once again tackles a controversial subject without making judgment on the protagonists himself. We follow the leader (Eric Bana) of the group sent on the mission of vengeance. His group is funded secretly by the government of Israel, but has no contact with them. They must find their victims through leads or info they get on their own, mostly through nebulous sources, who might be playing both sides against the middle. Noticeable is a pre-James Bond Daniel Craig who shines as one of the group members. Bana's character leaves his life behind for the mission, missing the birth of his child after his wife moves to Brooklyn in the USA. He struggles with the separation, as well as struggling over dealing justice in this manner, and possibly endangering his family. The film itself stirs up tension, but might have been edited a little tighter and less lengthy. Also, there is slight difficulty in some scenes in identifying who exactly is who when differentiating between the good guys and bad.",7,0,0,30 June 2015
