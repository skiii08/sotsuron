Requiem for a Dream," Supposedly good...
","The cinematography was great. This film was beautiful to watch from a technical standpoint. There were really only one or two things I'd change (Those annoying split-screens!), and I really loved film speed was played with.The acting was wonderful on all parts (Even Marlon Wayans, shock of all shocks!)And I want to marry the score.But I absolutely hated the movie. Why? Because I've never felt so emotionally manipulated in my life.",1,26,55,25 July 2002
