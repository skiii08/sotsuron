The Blair Witch Project," Like an episode of the X-Files but less satisfying.
","The Blair Witch Project was an interesting film that had a very unique concept. The story was well conceived and the sheer reality of the filming effects helped to make it more believable. The acting was fine given the premise of how the directors operated (limited scripts and a lot of adlibbing)and the scariest movies are the ones that really make you think and disturb you for days afterward (which this one did). The shaky camera technique and the disappointment of never seeing much of anything kept the movie from being more enjoyable. I think even a glimpse of what they were seeing would have been sufficient. I view this film as being much like an episode of the X-Files, but not even as good as some of those. At least with the X-Files there's a payoff...and although things on that show are not often wrapped up in a tidy package that's easy for everyone to live with, there is a creepy chill that stays with you, makes you think and long to see more. I wanted to see what happened after the films were discovered and brought back to town. I wanted to see what was being shown and written on the Internet site that helped hype the movie. Bottom line...better than most horror films, but not the best I've seen. Left me wanting too much.",7,1,1,2 September 1999
