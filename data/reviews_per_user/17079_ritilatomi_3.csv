Blade Runner 2049," A major disappointment
","The movie was a waste of time, I'm disappointed. It could have been better if the plot would had been decent or they even had tried to make it decent. Now there were all too many useless and dull side characters and frivolous complexities in the story. In addition, the script and dialogue were awful: they would have worked better if the movie had been cut till 1,5 or 2 hours of total runtime. Dialogue was repetitive. From the beginning, you just wait that OK, when does the action start. There are action sequences, but they are short and uninteresting. There's some nudity, too, but those parts with boobs are rather lame. It's a pity.Visuals and soundtrack were excellent as well as all gorgeous females in the cast. Otherwise, it is an over-long and boring movie to watch. Avoid and rent it instead if you want to watch it.",3,8,16,15 October 2017
Requiem for a Dream," Gets better and better every time
","Excellent movie and it gets better every time I see it again. Basically it is a desperate description of drug use in the modern American big city. On the other hand, the movie paints a meticulous depiction of a couple of people striving for happiness, satisfaction and a better, more fulfilling life. Especially Jared Letos work is stunning although other main characters perform excellently as well. One might find the movie very depressing and sad but that might be the aim of Aronofsky the director to get that kind of mood in his masterwork. World is full of happy and cheery movies so there is always a room for a bit depressing ones, too?",10,3,5,20 August 2014
True Romance," Horrible, over-acted and dull movie
","First of all, the acting is really over-acted all the way of the movie till the ending credits. Acting ruins everything and makes the movie unwatchable and even the serious scenes appears comic unfortunately. In addition, the soundtrack is dull and stupid, what were they thinking? Perhaps nothing. The plot is boring and not interesting; enough reasons to hit fast-forward after the first thirty minutes of the movie. I have to give one star because of the Arquette's beautiful eyes and buxom body, they will never disappoint and there is no option to give zero stars on IMDb. Finally, there are plenty of drug/crime-related movies to watch ie. this is easy to forget as quickly as possible.",1,7,21,12 March 2016
