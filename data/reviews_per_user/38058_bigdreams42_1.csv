The Monuments Men," Worth Every Penny: Anything Less Than 10/10 Is Shoddy On The Reviewer's Part
","The actors were great, and I loved the veneration given to the art. I am thankful for this movie so that when I see these works I can appreciate the price paid to have them. I loved the reason why the art must be saved, but you'll have to watch the movie to hear it. From a movie filming perspective I thought the action scenes were filmed well, and there wasn't any shoddy animation which is duly appreciated. There aren't any sexual scenes, which is highly appreciated, nor unnecessarily bloody scenes either. There was however quite a bit of cursing which I could have done without, but there wasn't to much and it was light where it was thrown in. Overall fantastic historical movie that is a must see to understand a not fully lauded point of World War II.",10,2,4,27 May 2014
