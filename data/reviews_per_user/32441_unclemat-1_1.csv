Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolutely disgusting. Has only one value.
","The only value is it reveals how many boorish and tasteless public is - rating such a boring, offensive and primitive movie so highly.Absolutely disgrace to cinematography and film industry as a whole. Mix of languages, cultures, offensive to both Kazakh people as well as Americans. This movie does not break barriers or reveals social oddities - it simply offends in an absolutely primitive way. Can only cater to very unsophisticated viewer - maybe that's why it seems to popular in the U.S.I wonder if people who laughed at this movie so loudly, were the same who did not laugh much watching 'Little Miss Sunshine' - a masterpiece of modern comedy.",1,16,34,20 November 2006
