3:10 to Yuma," fast movie with a lot of emotional undertones
","The film is overall a fast paced action movie with a lot of emotional conflicts.though the climax was a little bit difficult to believe.Russell crowe is stylish and charismatic ,but it was really the one legged rancher who stole the show in the end .two stars less for the seemingly an impossible end.the tension between the ranger and his son was well depicted .and the way Russell had almost with the ranger's wife too was done with minute nuances.the landscapes were very beautiful and even the minor characters come alive .and the bar girl with those green eyes and great buttocks is awesome.The only problem I had with the movie was it gave the impression to me in the end that stardom inched its way over the credibility",8,0,0,11 September 2013
