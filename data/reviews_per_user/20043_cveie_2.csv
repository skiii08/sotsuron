Requiem for a Dream," Do you want to sleep at night?
","This story is as horrible as they get. You turn off the TV with a completely empty feeling inside, as though all hope has just been torn away. I was not able to sleep the night I saw this movie, and would advise people to brace themselves before pressing play... This is not a bedtime story...",2,3,7,23 August 2002
Minority Report," Lack of mystery
","After visiting IMDb my expectations for this movie were huge. Steven Spielburg has done extremely well in creating Washington DC anno 2054. The scene is really set for a spectacular movie, and it's not boring at all! However it is so obvious who the villain is in this movie, and it really takes a lot of the joy out of it. If Spielburg had put a surprise ending on this one, it would definately rank amoung his best work.",6,0,0,14 August 2002
