Requiem for a Dream," Almost a home run, but not quite.
","Flashes of genius are cluttered throughout the depressing tale of heart break and drug addiction in the film Requiem for a Dream. Superb acting from Leto, Conneley, and yes, even Wayans made this movie a must see. The directing was no set back either, the unique style of every scene made the movie visually appealing as well. The only set back for me was the story itself. The story consists of constant heart breaks, highs, lows, and there is no clear morale or point. Requiem for a Dream is extremely dark and bitter, but it gives a raw up close look in the minds of demented drug addicts. This movie is not for everyone, but it is worth a try. 8/10",8,0,1,12 February 2013
