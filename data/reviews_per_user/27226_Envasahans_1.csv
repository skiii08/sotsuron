It," Highly anticipated, deeply disappointed
","IT is one of the few movies I actually looked forward to. The trailers looked great and the first reviews were very good. Nothing could go wrong, right? Uhm... no not exactly.The first 10 minutes of the movie (the Georgie meets IT part) were utterly brilliant and caused the first WTF moment. Things were looking good for IT.But it would be my last WTF moment because after that scene everything falls apart in IT.PROBLEM 1 the storytelling If you read the book or/and saw the miniseries you'll know that the story switches between past and present day. In the new IT you'll only get the past (guessing that the present day wil be in the sequel). This pretty much destroys the buildup and intensity of the story.PROBLEM 2 Pennywise Don get me wrong: Bill Skarsgard does an excellent job of portraying a terrifying clown but that's the problem right there. Pennywise in the new IT is only terrifying while the book describes Pennywise as a clown who appeals to children in a pleasant way and becomes terrifying when the victim is in grasp. It's the contrast between funny clown and horrific monster that makes the original Pennywise (book and miniserie) really terrifying.PROBLEM 3 CGI Never thought I would actually complain about CGI in a movie because I usually complain about the people complaining about CGI. But in IT the CGI really got on my nerves. Somehow it completely kills the eighties vibe. PROBLEM 4 Young Richie Toszier I like the dude in Stranger Things but in IT I had an instant disliking to his version of Richie Toszier. I don't know why but it just didn't feel like Richie....Maybe it's the fact that I grew up with the miniseries that I don't dig this version of IT but I tried. I really did and I really wanted to like it but I simply can't. I didn't feel it, I didn't feel the tensity of the book, I didn't feel the dark hidden secret of Derry... I only felt disappointment.",4,5,10,19 September 2017
