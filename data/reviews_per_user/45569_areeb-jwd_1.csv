Airlift," Historically inaccurate, and a terrible movie
","Why have people rated this positively, I shall never understand. Being in Kuwait during the invasion, I know for a fact that the Indian army was no where near Kuwait for an 'airlift', and the role of government officials has been distorted drastically. The acting is mediocre, the dialogues are a clich√©, the script is just horrendous. Akshay Kumar should stop acting altogether, watching him makes me want to stab my eyes. Its a really poor film. I wish I'd seen interstellar for the 10th time instead.Just pathetic, absolute trash.",1,18,34,9 February 2016
