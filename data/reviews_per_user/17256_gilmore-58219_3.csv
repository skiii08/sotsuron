It," Good but also disappointed
","The movie was good but as a fan of the mini series movie from the 90's, NO ONE could ever top Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise. Plus the movie is very different from the book. I understood that they wanted to make it more current in the time periods but doing that and making changes to the characters really takes away from what made the novel so great. Don't like that they made Ben like the town historian and Mike a farmer ( like what the heck). And then with Henry dying ( or at least that's what we're lead to believe). Idk, I just don't understand the new concept for the movie and how they plan to do the sequel. Lots of questionable things for me as a fan. It's gonna take one heck of a sequel for me to consider the remake of one of, if not, the best horror novels of all time, to be better than the iconic 90's adaptation. Good luck",7,0,0,8 April 2018
Ready Player One," Awesome in every way!!
",Spielberg pulled out all the stops in this one! From the great soundtrack to the nostalgic icons he threw in the mix. Bound to be another instant classic!,10,0,1,8 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," What a Atrocity!!
","I've been a Star Wars fan my entire life and I'm 37, and I had such great hopes when I heard Disney was gonna continue the Skywalker saga. Instead all I've got from this movie and the last is a big broken heart! They have trashed the whole thing by making these last two movies!! Just goes to show that all Disney cares about is the almighty dollar! If they truly cared about the franchise they would have kept Lucus on as consultant and went with his ideas for the continuation of the saga! Now that I've said my piece on to my review:
The Last Jedi was cinamatically a good movie. Lots of bright shiny lights and one liners for humor. Otherwise, Luke Skywalker milking a beast for blue milk!!! Really, was that necessary?? Just about lost my dinner to that scene. Then Leia flying through space using force powers she's never showed any signs of!! Give me a break! And then you go and kill Snoke without even an idea of who the heck he was or where he came from and why his force power is so strong. THENNNN, to cap it all off,... you go and kill off Luke Skywalker!!! That's the last straw!!! Even if that was ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, it shouldn't have happened until the last film, if at all! If I knew then, what I know now, I would've been very satisfied with Episode 6 being the last Star Wars movie in the Skywalker saga.",2,12,16,8 April 2018
