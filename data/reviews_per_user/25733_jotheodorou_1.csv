Walk the Line," Oscar nominations on the horizon for Phoenix and Witherspoon
","Terrific film, the lead performances are spectacular. Special kudos to the music editors, the sound was one of the best I have heard on film. This movie reeks of Oscar nods.The Cash/Carter duet numbers give you goose bumps, their chemistry thru their music gives you chills! A moving story, not your standard bio pic, and clears up all the Johnny Cash myths out there. Technically, quite an achievement for a new director (or is he?) and there is not a false note in this film. A must see, and you don't have to be a country music fan to appreciate the genius of Johnny Cash, and the appeal of June Carter.Too bad Johnny and June cannot see it, they would be so pleased.",Null,7,16,17 November 2005
