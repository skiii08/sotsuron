The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Simple Re-telling of the Bagavad Gita
","I read several reviews of this movie written by critics who simply missed the message.  Some even thought this movie was about nothing more than a man who lost his sexual prowess.This is a graceful, simple re-telling of the Bagavad Gita, the story of the warrior whose body survived the battle without his will and soul intact. The story of the man who overcame his victim mentality in order to fully realize his potential.The story is truly beautiful when you open yourself to the beauty.",10,0,1,22 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Bravo! The heart of the writing shines through!
","Bravo!  All I can add is that I nearly jumped from my seat when I saw how they filmed Sam's reaction to Frodo leaving.  In any other film, that performance would have been over-the-top.  I was afraid they would miss the importance of Sam's undying willingness to act from his heart. It was perfect! (Thanks, Sean, for getting it right!)",10,0,0,27 December 2001
Spirited Away," Amazingly filled with signifcant images
","Amazingly filled with significant images.  It seemed that every frame contained archetypical images that might escape the casual observer. Spirited Away is simply overflowing with spiritual truth.  Highly recommend more than one viewing of this sweet, exciting story.",10,0,1,13 December 2003
