50 First Dates," An 'Up' Movie
","I thought this was an 'up' movie with a kind of 'down' plot. I saw Adam Sandler as a very caring person who took a very difficult situation and dealt with it in a very positive way. I thought Drew Barrymore looked prettier in this movie than in a lot of others I've seen her in. She has the classic 'Barrymore' profile. I also liked Adam Sandler more than in other movies. Did you notice the credit he gave to his family at the very end? The scenery was beautiful. I had a little trouble with his helper at the Seaquarium - I'm not sure of the gender. Sean Austin could have done away with the lisp but his character rang true to some men I've known like that. Also, I didn't now you could train a walrus! I'd watch it again.",8,0,0,22 April 2005
