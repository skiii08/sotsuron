The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Cheese or not to Cheese? :p
","Best film of all the series. I have no idea why people insist on hating the Twilight Saga. I guess people just need to pick on something. I personally couldn't of enjoyed this movie more. Right from the beginning it had you on the edge of your seat wondering what would happen next. It had my full attention. I'm anxiously waiting for it to come out of DVD so I can purchase it and watch it over and over again of course :). One of the best modern day movie romances. Girls love it because the world lacks such romance and they yearn for their own Twilight love Saga. The guys hate it because they don't want to deal with the expectations this movie may bring upon them. Romance what? Romance Who? lol. Some find this film cheesy, but what's wrong with a little Cheese? Right? Cheese please! :D I hope you enjoy because I sure did!",10,0,10,15 January 2012
