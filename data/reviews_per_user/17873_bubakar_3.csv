The Blair Witch Project," Don't let the cynics fool you.
","After seeing this brilliant little piece of filmmaking I expected to see nothing but raves.  Granted there are plenty, and I certainly realize that tastes vary.  I just want to make it clear...I've seen well over 4000 movies in my fairly short life.  This is not only the most terrifying film I've ever seen, it is one of the finest piecest of filmmaking I've ever seen.  Is it a gimmick?  Yeah.  But gimmicks can be brilliantly used.  You don't think 'Rosebud' was gimmick?  It was...and it was brilliantly used.  Do I think that BWP was as good as Citizen Kane...I would never be so bold as to suggest that.  But is it a great film?  It is a great experience.  Don't let all of the new 'irony' and distance keep you from enjoying this movie.  Give yourself over and you will be taken on a most terrifying ride.",9,1,1,31 July 1999
Troy," Major Disappointment
","There are elements of Troy that work nicely.  The CGI effects are something special indeed.  The fight scene between Hector (Bana) and Achilles (Pitt) is very nicely choreographed.  In the end, though, it's all for naught. Peterson (who has delivered great action films in the past - Das Boot, Air Force One) needed to run to the editing board many times over.  I don't mind lengthy films (I can name several three-hour-plus films that I count among my all-time favorites), but 'Troy' pushes things to the limit.  Too many sequences feel redundant.  Brad Pitt is nice to look at and little more. He does not have the commande that Achilles should have.  For a warrior that is supposed to inspire the confidence of an entire army, it seems unlikely that he would muster more than a chorus of 'eh'.  Paring down one of the cornerstones of Western literature is certainly necessary to make it watchable on the screen, but seeing 'Troy' is certainly not necessary for anyone.  Save your $10 and your butt - Don't see 'Troy'.",4,9,19,14 May 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A World Masterpiece
","Ang Lee's film is a lyrical masterpiece, rightfully noted by the American Film Institute as 'bringing the world together.' Heavily weighted in Eastern philosophy and tradition, 'Crouching Tiger' accessibly brings Asian film to Western audiences. The film begins by slowly setting the stage for the romance subplot between Chow Yun Fat's 'Mu Bai' and Michelle Yeoh's 'Shu Lien'. The fan expecting all action may find this initial opening slow. However, the more estute fan will recognize this as the necessary build-up. Les the action fan get bored, the fights kick up a mere ten minutes into the film, and when they do, boy, is he paid off.  The initial fight scene introduces the audience to an audacious display of superior martial artistry.  Anyone who thought the use of the word 'arts' in 'martial arts' was a stretch will be proved wrong. The choreography in this initial battle is pure bliss.  Every time you think they can't outdo themselves, believe me, they do. With each subsequential fight, you think you've seen the best, but then Ang Lee, moving himself into the world canon of directors, tops them all with a fight at the top of a bamboo forest that will literally leave you in awe. This viewer has seen too many films in his lifetime, but 'Crouching Tiger' really brought back the magic of going to the movies. It truly lifts you to a place where you've never been.  I, again, felt like the six year old who saw 'Star Wars', and to recapture that feeling 25 years later was cinematic bliss. Go.  And then go again.  The new millennium has just begun, but Ang Lee has given other filmmakers a peak to reach for.  'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is the 'Star Wars' for the world economy. Subtitles or no, it is the greatest film in decades, and, I believe, for decades to come.",10,0,0,2 February 2001
