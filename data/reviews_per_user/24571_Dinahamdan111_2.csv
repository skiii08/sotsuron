Come and See," Not worth watching
","I decided to watch this movie after reading the good reviews, but the movie actually is boring, slow, action is only in the last 45 minutes. The sound is weird.
Honestly, don't waste your time. There are way better WW2 movies.",4,3,26,8 February 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Extremely boring, don't waste your time
","I can't believe the ratings!! The movie is sooo boring and slow. I'm so disappointed, I had to write this.
If you're here to watch a touching or dramatic movie about the holocaust as I was hoping to, this movie is so far from that, go watch Schindler's list or The pianist.
I was tempted to watch this based on the ratings, but definitely such a waste of time.",2,2,7,10 January 2020
