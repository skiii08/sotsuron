United 93," A respectful account to a tragic event.
","United 93 was the first Hollywood rendition of the unforgettable 911 plane crashes. Thankfully there was no Titanic love story, and no big budget re-enactment of the 911 crashes.Tastefully, Writer/Director Paul Greengrass decided to show three of the plane crashes from the perspective of the control centers. This turned out to be a very interesting, and suspenseful way to present the tragedy. The decisions that had to be made and the actions that weren't being carried out, really revealed the hopelessness of the situation. Although this created suspenseful moments and great anticipation, the same conversations and shaky camera movements for almost an entire hour became a bit tedious.There is no main character in this story. Instead the main character is the body of passengers that boarded United 93. The reactions of the passengers and flight attendants seemed very real. United 93 is made up of all kinds of passengers. Business people. Families. Tourists. The portrayal of those aboard United 93, down to the moments when serious decisions needed to be made concerning the terrorist attack, seemed painfully believable.Greengrass was also successful in making it clear that the terrorists were also human. The terrorists displayed moments of hesitation and fear to commit these acts of terror. Though their actions were undeniably vicious, they were men that would do anything to serve the Lord.My only complaints were that the control room conversations did begin to drag in the beginning, and an ending, or lack thereof could have been improved.There is a great, great rise in the climax and the movie definitely makes an impact. But frankly, it seemed like the movie took the easy way out by using text on the screen to tell the rest of the story rather than presenting it visually. With that great rise in suspense leading to nothing, the movie almost feels incomplete.Overall the movie is a great reminder of how significantly the event affected our lives. Thank God they didn't make it out to be a Shwarzenegger blockbuster or a Pearl Harbor romance. Instead it respectfully told the story of the individuals aboard United 93 who had no choice but to become their own heroes.",8,2,5,30 April 2006
"I Love You, Man"," I Loved it, Man!
","Man, I love Paul Rudd. And I'm almost positive that right after you watch his latest feature, you will too.Paul Rudd (Clueless, The Shape of Things, Anchorman, 'Friends', 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Role Models) plays Peter Klaven, a semi-successful real estate agent who proposes to his beautiful girlfriend of eight months, Zooey, played by the talented heartmelter Rashida Jones (Karen from 'The Office').Their relationship seems almost picture perfect, their classic love-at-first-sight story, their comfortable HBO TV Nights, and best of all, her girl friends adore him. The only problem is, Peter's guy friends don't care much for Zooey, because well, he doesn't have any. In fact, he's never really had any. Which begs the question: Who the hell will be Peter Klaven's Best Man at his wedding?? A couple of uncomfortable and unpredictable man dates later, enter Sidney (Jason Segel), who shows up at an open house hosted by Peter Klaven. Only he's not there to check out the multi-million dollar estate owned by 'The Incredible Hulk' Lou Ferrigno. Sidney's there to scope out the recent divorcées who commonly show up at open houses, and to grab some free sandwiches while he's at it.With Sidney's uncanny understanding of male behavior, his barbaric display of testosterone, his similar taste in Rock & Roll, and his honest and vulgar approach to male bonding (hence the R-Rating), is this really the Best Man Pete's been looking for? Or the Worst Man that could ever happen to not only Pete's pending marriage with Zooey, but also his career, and ultimately his life?? As implied by the sentimental title, this film was building up to be the definitive Bromantic Comedy, and in my opinion, they pulled it off. I Love You, Man is Paul Rudd at his finest. He charmed his way into a clueless Alicia Silverstone, he started a timeless string of homophobic questioning with Seth Rogen, and he helped a self-loathing Jason Segel forget Sarah Marshall with a spaced out surf lesson.Now Paul's back to find a best man, and the chemistry he has with the best man to-be is pure comedy. Thankfully we get a front row seat to all his awkwardness, his flamboyance, his unabashed silliness, and his hopelessness, and all of it is completely hysterical, and completely endearing. (You know how I know you're gay? You think Paul Rudd is endearing.) Alongside Paul is a unique ensemble of characters, including Andy Samberg playing Pete's gay brother, JK Simmons playing the everyman father (not unlike his role as Juno's dear old dad), and a handful of other awesome cameos that create some great moments. Director John Hamburg does a great job of creating an open environment to let them play off of each other, uninhibited and sometimes ridiculous.I Love You, Man is funny, honest, over-the-top yet true-to-life, and yes, I'll say it again, completely endearing.",10,92,155,21 March 2009
500 Days of Summer," (500) Thumbs Up for Days of Summer
","An opening disclaimer sets the tone for the rest of the movie: ironic and so true. The movie is fun, frustrating, simple, difficult, triumphant, and depressing, much like the nature of any loving relationship. (500) Days of Summer is a traditional love story told in a nontraditional fashion, combining and contrasting over-the-top fantasy with harsh reality. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy loves girl, girl doesn't love boy because her divorced parents destroyed the very idea of true love sending the boy into a downward spiral of sorrow and recklessness.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect that writes greeting cards for a living. Of course, he has an even greater aspiration to one day find true love, a curse and a blessing that was embedded in his innocent mind after watching 'The Graduate' at a young and tender age. His life changes completely when a new Executive Assistant joins the office: Summer Finn (the beautiful Zooey Deschanel), and she's like a modern-day Audrey Hepburn. Who wouldn't fall in love with an Audrey Hepburn? A drunken office karaoke session and a long-awaited kiss later, Tom and Summer Finn are goofing off and holding hands at an IKEA. (Aww, Tom and Finn. How cute.) Their relationship is reminiscent of Joel and Clementine from 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind.' Like Eternal, their story is told nonlinearly. We ping-pong between different stages of their relationship, from Day (1) to Day (500), revealing both the beauty and the tragedy of Tom's pursuit to win Summer Finn.The difference is, Tom doesn't have a machine to erase any trace of Summer, but must instead live with the pain that scarred him so deeply. What Tom does have is a great support system: two close buddies who care for him sincerely but have no clue how to handle this unhealthy situation, and a kid sister who happens to say all the right things.Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are perfect in this movie. He is tossed around both emotionally and physically, from extreme highs to terrible lows, and if you don't cheer for him, then you have no heart. She just owns the screen, and everything about her makes it easy to see why a guy would spend (500) days pining for this woman.There are some amazing moments in this movie, beyond the content. Like Eternal's Michel Gondry, Director Marc Webb started his career making music videos ('All That I've Got' by The Used and 'I'm Not Okay (I Promise)' by MCR, amongst other countless greats). It's no wonder why his feature film debut is as artistic and as entertaining as it truly is. This is Day (1) of a film career that is no doubt going to be an enjoyable one to watch.",9,12,24,26 July 2009
Cloverfield," Cloverfield: Midnight Showing
","At one point in the movie, one character echoes the famous words from the original home-video horror flick The Blair Witch Project: 'I'm so scared.' Only in Cloverfield what they encounter is much more scary and life-threatening than a crazy lady running through the woods. Cloverfield is a 90 minute roller-coaster ride that will increase your adrenaline as much as it will increase your dire need for a vomit bag.Rob is leaving for Japan for his career and a surprise party is thrown on his behalf. Hud takes up the responsibility of cameraman, whose purpose is to document the farewell testimonies. This provided an interesting way to introduce the characters and gave insight into their personalities and relationships. Telling a story through this style of filming could be pretty difficult, but Cloverfield actually pulls it off. You even grow fond of some of the characters in the process, which is especially important for a movie that depends on the survival of the characters. It also helps that the actors gave likable and pretty convincing performances.The party is interrupted by a series of tremors, a short blackout, and a flurry of fireballs flying through the air. New York is under attack. From then on you are sucked into a crazy trip through the panic of the dismantled city as Hud decides to continue videotaping the events, knowing that the world will want to see what exactly happened that night in New York City.Although the movie offers a great story of bravery and camaraderie, that's not what anyone cares about right? Everyone wants to know what 'It' is. Trust me. 'It' is something far more ugly and terrifying than a giant cuddly ape.Going into the movie, you of course need to suspend a little disbelief. Aside from the monster itself, you also have to accept their ability to somehow escape certain situations; otherwise it would be a much shorter movie. If I were documenting the whole thing the video would probably last five minutes. To make up for it, little details are thrown in to maintain the atmosphere of authenticity, taking pictures of the head of a decapitated Statue of Liberty with a cell phone camera for example, or the looters who horde the electronics store amidst all the chaos.The special effects are completely mind-blowing. The Toyota Tacoma and 'Ratchet and Clank' commercials really did something special when they combined special effects with the home video feel. Cloverfield takes this concept to the maximum extreme and does an excellent job making the surreal as real as it can get.The suspense will get to you. There are times that make you jump and times that make you cringe. The end will either leave you wanting more or begging for it to be over. No matter what the case, Cloverfield is an experience you will never forget. (Word of advice: DO NOT sit in the first five rows, especially in IMAX. Big mistake.)",8,4,11,18 January 2008
Tangled," Belle Who? There's a New Beauty in Town.
","Rather than your ordinary Once Upon a Time, the story of Tangled starts with a voice-over from Flynn Ryder, our egotistical antihero, warning you that this is a story about how he died. This American Beauty style prologue is a clear indication that although it's a Disney movie, this story is not without the darkness of Grimm. As Disney's 50th animated feature film, Disney freaks and general moviegoers alike will be pleased to find that Tangled is worthy of the golden hallmark. It's beautifully animated, full of surprises, and really funny. I'll even go so far as to say it has the power to jerk a few tears.Disney decided to go with an alternate title instead of sticking to the original Rapunzel. It works because this imaginative retelling seems to be a little more than a story about a girl with long hair. It's also a story about an old woman consumed with a fear of dying. Her name is Gothel, and she's the figure that sets all the action in motion by kidnapping the baby princess at birth. She did this because she's aware of the magical properties that lay hidden in our heroine's golden locks: sing a special song to it, and you can live forever.Gothel hides Rapunzel away in a tower, raises her as her own, and forbids her from seeing the light of day, urging the world is an evil place. This is creepy within itself, and among all the Disney villains, Gothel is by far one of the creepiest, reminiscent of the mom in Stephen King's Carrie, from the scary way she keeps her daughter sheltered down to the scary way she is ultimately defeated.Gothel at least had the decency to provide Rapunzel with a library of books. This has kept Rapunzel occupied for all the 18 years she spent in isolation, and has made her apt at a range of activities some of us may never learn: painting, paper mache, charting stars. Still, she longs to see the world, if only to find the source of the floating lanterns: mysterious lights that fill the sky every year on the night of her birthday.Flynn Ryder's not your average knight-in-shining armor. He's more like Gaston in a Han Solo costume. Poor Flynn is in enough trouble as it is, constantly hounded down for stealing a prized possession from the royal family. Aside from the palace guards, Flynn has to deal with twin goons that resemble Jason Stathem and a tenacious police horse. Next thing you know, Flynn is stuck with a teenage girl in desperate need of rebellion.Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi provide the speaking and singing voices for our two protagonists, and do a phenomenal job. The voice acting is pitch perfect, just like the music composed by the legendary Academy Award-winning Alan Menken.I can't wait to see Rapunzel at Disneyland, not just because she's smoking hot, but also because it'll be entertaining to see eight guards following close behind to accommodate her long head of hair. The 260 million dollar budget makes this the most expensive animated feature to date. Considering the magic it will bring to households 50 more years down the road, Tangled is worth every penny.",10,33,40,29 November 2010
Ant-Man," Ant-icipation is over. I Love You, Ant-Man.
","Ant-Man must have been a challenge for these filmmakers. The preceding films from the Avengers Universe featured an epic roster of out-of-this-world heroes whose names alone make you tinkle a little: IRON MAN, THOR, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and then there's Ant-Man. (Womp-womp) While die-hard fans of the comics would recognize Ant-Man as an original member of the ensemble, the general audience may be left to wonder WTF?!Ant-Man, do you even lift, Bro?The filmmakers must have been aware of this, considering the tongue-in-cheek treatment of the script. With a screenplay largely penned by Shaun of the Dead legend Edgar Wright, and built upon by other great comedic writers, Joe Cornish (Attack the Bock), Adam McKay (Anchorman), and Ant-Man himself Paul Rudd, Ant-Man does indeed do some heavy lifting, delivering one of the funniest, most entertaining, and visually satisfying superhero movies to date.The ant super-suit is sick. Red and silver with bulging insectoid eyes, it looks like a modern day motocross version of the Japanese monster slayer Ultraman. As soon as he hits the shrink button, you are sucked into a world so awesome you have no choice but to brace yourself and see where the ride takes you. Stan Lee wanted to make this movie in the 80's but ironically Disney, the production company behind today's Ant-Man, already had a shrinking movie of its own in the works. While 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' was amazing in its time, I couldn't be happier that they waited for the movie effects of today to let Ant- Man zip this way and that, from our world to the minuscule one and back. Coincidentally an ant saved the kids from a giant scorpion in that Rick Moranis classic, and in Ant-Man the ants also play a major role in saving the day. That's right. His power is not only to shrink to the size of an ant, but also to control an army of them. In that respect, this movie is unlike any superhero movie you've ever seen.The Pym Particle, created by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has the ability to shrink a living human being. Think of the possibilities! Microsurgery, mobility, and of course, warfare! The latter makes Dr. Pym realize just how dangerous this technology really is and he decides to cease research and development altogether. Years pass, and the existence of this technology is reduced to a myth. What Dr. Pym didn't know is that his own assistant Darren Cross (Corey Stoll, House of Cards) had been obsessing over this myth and has been trying to replicate this technology on his own. Stoll has a unique ability to make you sympathize for his character at times, but can also be straight up scary.Dr. Pym and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly, Lost) know they have to stop Cross but keep butting heads. Hope is a badass, but Pym refuses to let her get involved, which reveals some deeper, more serious daddy issues. Their only hope is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd, my man crush), an ex-convict who was a professional burglar, not a robber because Lang insists that implies physical violence, and he's not about that life. To pull off the job, Lang enlists his original heist crew, played by David Dastmalchian, Rapper T.I., and Michael Peña, who offers some of the most hilarious scenes in the movie. What ensues is an adventure, a comedy, an action movie and a heist rolled into one Little Debbie oatmeal cookie crumb of elephantine excitement and pure elation. If you haven't noticed, I like this movie.Close friends may say I am biased because it stars Paul Rudd, whom I have been enamored with ever since Clueless. When Cher realized she was in love with Josh, I too realized Paul Rudd is my number one man crush. Let me close this by taking a moment to acknowledge how perfect Paul Rudd is in the role of Scott Lang/Ant-Man. He is a master at self-deprecating humor, as seen in movies like 'I Love You, Man' and 'Knocked Up' and his role as Mike Hannigan on 'Friends.' This is a necessity when you see how Ant-Man may have somewhat of a Napoleon Complex when he inevitably has to measure up against the mighty Avengers. Paul Rudd has shown his chops as a dramatic actor in movies like 'The Shape of Things' and 'Admission,' and again here in Ant- Man as an estranged father, who wants nothing more than to spend more time with his daughter Cassie. While elements of his various roles can be seen in Ant-Man this was nothing like anything Paul Rudd has ever done before, and he pulled it off.His dedication can be seen not only in the moment that reveals his handsomely chiseled abs. In preparation for the role, Paul Rudd bought an ant farm to study. Even after he finished shooting, he decided to keep it. Just when you thought you couldn't fall in love with Paul Rudd any further. On the week the movie was released, Paul Rudd earned a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and deservedly so. Somehow it's not the star that immortalizes him in film history. It's his stellar performance in Ant-Man, the movie that will shrink and find its way into your heart and stay there forever.",10,54,110,19 July 2015
The Hills Have Eyes," A Trip Gone Wrong
","'The Hills Have Eyes' features a small family that goes on an incredible trip that suddenly became a living hell. Such was the same unfortunate fate of the movie itself. The movie had potential to be a great thriller, but slowly faded into a world of horror movie clichés and improbable situations.A small area in New Mexico was designated a nuclear testing site. However a family of miners refused to leave the area. The result: a generation of deformed beings with a strong resentment to the rest of the human race.This movie tells the story of a small family on their way to San Diego. The movie was successful in establishing the family as a relatable and likable group of people. There is a retired cop father, a loving mother who was once a 60's hippie, their oldest daughter along with her baby and husband (the son-in-law looking for the approval of the in-laws), the adorable adolescents Bobbie and Brenda, and their lovable canines Beauty and Beast. Aww how cute.Little do they know, they are driving directly into the clutches of another family that is not so lovable. A group of deranged individuals, physically and mentally, who not only rob from the passing tourists, but mutilate them, and of course, the inevitable tendency for deranged families in horror films to indulge in the delicacy of cannibalism.The film was good in setting the atmosphere for the different families and in turning up the suspense and tension when the two collide. In the beginning, you surprisingly care for the tourist family and hope they make it out alive. But as the events transpire, and the family begins to make stupid decisions, and the deformed family begin to make stupider ones, the emotional content of the film is lost, including any hint of compassion and even, unfortunately, fear.There were a few walkouts in the theater when I watched it opening night, but i couldn't tell if they were due to the graphic content, or the unsatisfactory film-making. There are moments of great suspense and a phenomenal makeup job on the Texas Chainsaw-like ensemble. But seriously, when are victims in movies going to learn never to leave each other alone and follow unfamiliar noises? And when will cannibalistic families learn to eat 'em when you get the chance, instead of waiting around and giving your dinner that final opportunity to get away?For what it's worth, this was a decent attempt, and the movie is good enough for a rental. But when it comes down to it, I'd rather spend a night in those hills than a night with the crazy truck driver in Harold and Kumar. 'The Hills Have Eyes' is not so much a horror film as it is an instructional video for what not to do when going on a cross-country road trip. Never trust gas attendants. Unless its a Shell.",4,6,14,11 March 2006
The Conjuring 2," Conjuring 2 Director James Wan is the Master Magician of Horror
","Director James Wan is a magician. He has all the tricks... Sleight of hand... Misdirection... Creating illusions that will terrify you to the core, without having to resort to gore or cheap thrills. Granted he is a master of making you jump out your seat, of making your heart skip a beat, but it's his ability to force you to hold your breath that makes his Conjuring movies so appealing and so much fun to watch. The camera pans and tilts at weird angles. The foreground and background focus and blur interchangeably as if to visually bend reality. A voice whispers in the dark. And through all this, somewhere in the back of your mind, the nagging horror that horrified you when you watched the Exorcist for the very first time, five words: Based on a true story.Like the first Conjuring (brilliant movie) the sequel is a dramatization of a case investigated by real life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The first Conjuring described the events of a house haunted by a witch called Bathsheba. The Warrens were often tackling multiple cases at once, and to emphasize the emotional stress that came with it, the first Conjuring also detailed the Warrens' experiences with a doll named Anabelle that reportedly came to life, possessed by an evil spirit, that is to this day locked away in a glass case in the back of the Warren household.In Part 2 we are re-introduced to the Warrens by reminding us of the case that catapulted the couple into the public eye, the murders in Amityville. The majority of this film, however, actually takes place across the pond in London, where a strange entity disturbed the peace of a poor, struggling single-mom and her four children. This became the most documented paranormal case in history, an entity known as the Enfield Poltergeist.The Conjuring 2 has a great cast. Frances 'O Connor plays Peggy Hodgson, the single mom who has to hold the house together in the midst of all the horror, including all the ridicule from non-believers. She's a mother trying and failing to maintain sanity. She wants to be brave for her kids, yet can't help but to be visibly agitated. Her youngest son Billy, a little boy with a stutter, is adorable, constantly bullied by his peers but is overwhelmed with boundless joy at the sight of a biscuit! The one who stole the show, however, was Madison Wolfe as Janet Hodgson, who in the real-life haunting was the entity's favorite target. Definitely see shades of Linda Blair in her performance.Other players like Simon McBurney as Maurice Gross, the British paranormal investigator who was primarily involved with the Enfield Poltergeist, even the constables who corroborated that some freaky stuff went down in the house, look and act just like those involved in the real case (did some investigating of my own on YouTube). Of course the real heroes of the film are Ed and Lorraine Warren played by Patrick Wilson (Insidious) and Vera Fermiga (Bates Motel) - as you can see both actors have a tendency towards dark material. They are an attractive couple, extremely likable, and as in the first Conjuring, there's a sense of adoration and compassion for the work the Warrens do. Both Patrick and Vera have this uncanny ability to make you feel comforted one minute, but with a slight contortion of the face, you know something is wrong. 'I've got a bad feeling about this.' Regardless whether you believe in this stuff or not, there's admiration for a couple who have dedicated their lives to helping others, freeing the tormented from inexplicable horrors when no one else can. Ed and Lorraine Warrens were the only ones outside of the clergy who were authorized by the Catholic Church to perform exorcisms.'Based on a true story' should always be taken with a grain of salt. There are definitely some fantastical terrors that are there for show, inspired by nightmares as seen in Insidious or the Babadook. Like the first Conjuring, they don't turn a blind eye to alternative explanations for the events that take place, and allow you to view the subject from the skeptic's standpoint before diving headfirst into the dark realm of the beyond. One thing for sure is that the filmmakers have respect for the original material, pulling from old photographs to recreate the real settings, down to the details of the posters on their bedroom walls. What better example is there of respect for the material than this: prior to filming Conjuring Part 2, the filmmakers had a Catholic priest come in to bless the set. Apparently eerie occurrences took place when they filmed the first Conjuring movie. I ain't afraid of no ghosts. No poltergeist is going to stop Director James Wan and Writers Chad and Carey Hayes from telling the amazing story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and with many more cases yet to be explored, I really hope they can conjure up another one.",9,0,2,12 June 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Scott Pilgrim wins. Flawless Victory.
","The movie opens with an 8-bit recreation of the Universal Pictures company logo, complete with a new rendition of the studio's fanfare done in nostalgic MIDI format. Ah the good old days of fat video game cartridges that never work until you blow into the microchip slot. For me, this was love at first sight as Edgar Wright (Director, Shaun of the Dead) prepares you for a crazy ride through the trying times of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a young romantic determined to literally fight his way into the heart of his one true love, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). You will find yourself entranced by the dazzling visuals backed by a score made up of head-thumping punk rock and classic video game themes. This truly is an epic of epic epicness.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is adapted from a popular series of graphic novels written by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Inspired by punk rock, Manga comics, video games, and Kung Fu classics, this movie is a modern telling of a classic love story, catered to the MTV Generation. That's not to say anyone born outside of this generation won't enjoy the ride. No joke falls flat. Instead they fly at you in vivid color. The movie reads like a comic book and plays like a video game. Like a comic book, the text is an integral part of the storytelling. A series of D's flies out of Scott Pilgrim's bass guitar in rhythmic fashion as he prepares for a killer solo. An occasional onomatopoeia flashes across the screen with a THWOMP or THUNK of someone's head, reminiscent of the Adam West Batman. Like a video game, every bad guy Pilgrim kills spontaneously bursts into coins, accumulating a score that serves no purpose. It's a wacky game of Whose Line is it Anyway where the points don't matter but you find yourself rooting for a winner.I was reminded of Tarantino's Kill Bill. The hero has a list of people to kill, but unlike the Bride, Pilgrim isn't out looking for trouble. The trouble finds him in the form of The League of the Seven Exes, a dark alliance formed by Ramona's latest ex, Gideon Gordon Graves (Jason Schwartzman), whose sole purpose is to challenge any romantic soul brave enough to seek the heart of the impulsive, attractive, and elusive Ramona Flowers. Every ex that Pilgrim encounters offers a different kind of fight, a new challenging way for Scott to win, and another chance for Wright to bring you an entertaining display of light and sound.Scott Pilgrim vs. The World introduces you to a wild ensemble of characters. Scott Pilgrim himself is a scrawny, unassuming young man who seems harmless at first until you discover the impressive track record of broken hearts he's left along the way. One of those broken hearts belongs to the girl drummer in his indy punk rock band, the Sex Bob-Ombs, another endearing Nintendo reference. Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) is his Chinese high school girlfriend, head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend and completely obsessed with his band. Pilgrim's anal sister (Anna Kendrick) and his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin) also offer big laughs.Like Tarantino in Kill Bill, Wright is given a playground with no rules. The fourth wall is almost nonexistent and nobody ever asks why, not the people watching the movie nor the people in the movie. You sit back, suspend all belief, and hope that Scott Pilgrim beats the game. Like Miyamoto's Super Mario Brothers, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a game you will want to play again and again and again.",10,6,25,16 August 2010
Batman Begins," The Bat is Back
","Over the years the Gotham City that was once a dark place lined with evil and corruption, in desperate need of a hero, deteriorated into a circus tent of Hollywood displays with over-dramatic architecture and special effects... Where criminals dance around in blacklight sensitive face paint and so-called villains compete for best comedic performance. Behind all the bright lights and all-star celebrity casting, we lost grasp of what the saga is really about: Batman.Batman Begins opens with Bruce Wayne's discovery as a little boy of an underground cave where he is traumatized by an attack of massive waves of thousands of hideous bats. From this incident came an instilled fear that will forever torment Bruce Wayne. After the death of his parents, a deep hatred towards crime grows more and more until Bruce decides to vanish from Gotham City. He learns the skills of an ancient vigilante ninja organization, developing not only the skills of martial arts but most importantly the mastery of fear- skills that will ultimately be the best weapons in facing the evils that will reach Gotham City and to avenge the death of his beloved parents.Batman Begins restores the integrity of the Batman saga and goes into an even deeper conflict... his constant struggle with fear and his deep hatred towards everything evil. What the other Batman movies lightly touched on, Batman Begins tells vividly. Why a billionaire would devote his life to fighting evil. Where he gets all his nifty convenient gadgets. Why Bruce Wayne can take on 30 armed guys all on his own and without a gun. And finally why he dresses up as a bat... after all 'A guy who dresses up as a bat... clearly has issues.' And Batman does and should have issues, especially after witnessing first hand the death of his loving parents, deaths that he feels partly responsible for. The other movies didn't emphasize enough the true anger Bruce Wayne has towards those that commit to a life of evil, but in this movie, Batman, effectively played by Christian Bale, is clearly depicted as a man anxious to release his anger and frustration to avenge the death of his parents.Evil is definitely present in this movie. Where the villains in previous Batman movies seem like decent people to hang out with, or in Poison Ivy's case make out with, the enemies in this movie know there is a job to be done and that there is no time to be funny- not to belittle Jack Nicholson's role of the Joker, who has a right to be funny. The depiction of the Scarecrow was amazing, possessing an evil presence unlike any other Batman villain.As much as I loved Tim Burton's work, and Michael Keaton's portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman, I'd have to say that the direction of Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale as Batman put together the best Batman movie ever made. Besides Christian Bale, the casting was impressive. Alfred, played by Michael Caine and Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, are both characters you'll be glad to have alongside Bruce Wayne.It really is refreshing to see Batman and to finally learn after decades who he really is. A Batman who is angry and troubled and there to kick some ass not just for show but with a passion. Now the legend can live on with dignity and generations from now on can see the true man behind the bat... not just some heartthrob in tight pants.",10,16,22,16 June 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," Disney headed in the right di-WRECK-tion!
","The trailer alone, garnered much buzz for Disney's latest 3D adventure. Seeing some of'the great video game villains of all time assembled in one room was just too good to be true. The hype was elevated to even greater heights given its ubiquitous presence at San Diego Comic Con. In the back of mind I kept thinking, 'THEY'RE GONNA WRECK IT!'Thankfully, the movie succeeds in creating a heartfelt tribute to the golden era of the 80's arcade, decorated here and there with familiar cameos that are both nostalgic and laugh out loud hilarious. The actual video game characters and their respective worlds don't play as big a role in the movie as I imagined. My wishful, nerdy brain hoped Ralph would be jumping through pipes in Mushroom Kingdom, riding horseback through Hyrule and blasting away at baddies alongside Mega Man and who knows who else. This didn't happen, and may have to do with the price of buying the rights to some of these iconic images. But the new world Disney Animation Studios created is rich with surprises, and rivals that of Monstropolis, Toy Story, and the Kingdom of Far and Far Away. Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by the incomparable John C. Reilly) is the Donkey Kong to Fix-It Felix, Jr.'s Mario in a fictional 80's arcade game. The game itself is believable enough to have existed during the era. Ralph, along with other villains in various games throughout the ages, share the same plight of feeling under-appreciated by gamers and other citizens of the video game world. The breaking point for Ralph was the 30th Anniversary for the 'Fix-it Felix, Jr.' arcade. To commemorate the event, Felix throws a party in the penthouse of the game's high-rise apartment complex, a party that Ralph wasn't invited to. (The DJ of this party offered another cameo I really wasn't expecting and left me in awe of this tribute to electronic art.) What sets Ralph apart from all the other villains is that he is determined to actually do something about the unfortunate role of 'Bad Guy' he was programmed to assume. He intends to jump to different arcades in order to become a hero in another game. This act of invading a game other than your own is mysteriously referred to as 'Going Turbo' by the other inhabitants of the video game world. It's considered taboo, especially since it runs the risk of permanent death: dying outside your own game makes it impossible to regenerate.After a series of unfortunate events, Ralph eventually crash lands into Sugar Rush, a cross between the worlds of Candy Land and Mario Kart. There he befriends the adorable Vanellope (voiced by the lovely Sarah Silverman), who like Ralph is seen as an outcast in her game. In her case, she is considered a freak due to her tendency to glitch out. To Vanellope, racing runs deep within her code, but the only thing stopping her is the candy land's ruler the Candy King, who is adamant on keeping her out of the race.Ralph's spontaneous hero's journey spells trouble for the rest of the video game world. Due to Ralph's disappearance, the 'Fix-it Felix, Jr.' game is in danger of being unplugged, leaving Felix with the hefty responsibility of retrieving his clumsy counterpart. Ralph's brief stint in a Halo-esque game called 'Hero's Duty' is also a big nuisance to the foxy Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch). She must now track down and exterminate a Cybug that Ralph mistakenly helped escape from the game. If the bug goes viral, it could destroy every game in Mr. Litwak's entire arcade for good.The video game setting offers awesome moments of creativity for the Disney animators, from the way the characters are drawn and animated, to the way their lives are portrayed outside of their own game. The voice talent is also really impressive across the board. While the movie isn't the all-out Smash Brothers brawl many were expecting, the movie comes with loads of surprises that are sure to delight and entertain a wide audience, gamers and non-gamers alike.The movie could not have come at a better time. People who grew up during the era of the arcade are now starting to have families of their own, and are very likely to laugh along with the children they bring to the theaters. This same video game generation also witnessed the Disney Renaissance of the early 90's: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and the Lion King. With Wreck-It Ralph destined to be an instant classic, following the success of the equally impressive Tangled, we are in for a new Disney Renaissance for a whole new generation.Note: Get there early enough for an excellent animated short, and stay to watch the credits roll if you haven't yet satisfied your nerdy gamer fix.",9,33,40,2 November 2012
Cars," Pixar delivers another classic package.
","Pixar has the difficult obligation of bettering itself with each subsequent movie in order to please their fans. With instant classics in Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, the Pixar standards are set high. I wondered how Pixar could take the concept of talking cars into an entertaining film and original story and characters, especially considering the studio's standards.Though the new Pixar film is not 'better' than its other features, Cars is definitely up to par with the rest of the classics, delivering yet again a complete package of stunning visuals, a great story, and memorable characters.Lightning McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is a hot shot racecar that needs to make it to California to make it to a big race and fulfill his childhood dreams of winning the Piston Cup. However, a series of unfortunate events lead him to the beat up town of Radiator Springs. Though the town doesn't look like much, it is actually full of an assortment of charming citizens that take great pride in the place they lived in all their lives, its people (cars rather) and its history.In Radiator Springs, the hotshot McQueen learns lessons about the different aspects of life he has taken for granted, among other things: like how to have a good time at a night out with Mater, a rusty tow truck voiced by Larry 'the Cable Guy' (Git R Done!).Pixar pulled it off. A movie about talking cars actually turned out to be a heartwarming story, with hilarious sequences and dialog. Pixar does a great job of personifying the world of inanimate objects. A lowrider that specializes in Body Art. An Italian tire salesman (salescar rather) obsessed with and only with Ferraris.The movie was entertaining from beginning to end (even before and after the movie). Make sure to get there early to check out the awesome short 'One Man Band' a worthy addition to Pixar's collection of animated shorts. And after the film, Pixar replaces their blooper gag reel for a new treat that may be the funniest closer yet.How does Pixar do it? Create such great stories with such memorable characters? Besides Oscar the Shark Slayer I can't remember anyone else from Shark's Tale, and I am hopeless in remembering a single character's name from Robots, nor the Wild, but I can name Pixar characters in a heartbeat. Those movies can eat Pixar's dust Lightning McQueen style.No photo finish is necessary to determine that Cars is a definite winner. We can all breathe a sigh of relief that John Lasseter and Pixar yet again prevailed in bringing us another gem to join our growing collection of Pixar classics. Sigh.",10,7,10,10 June 2006
Kick-Ass," 'Kick-Ass': They're Not Who We Thought They Were
","'Original' and 'Unconventional' seem to be the common words used to describe 'Kick-Ass'. The movie climbed to the number one spot in the box office opening weekend, climbed up the prestigious IMDb Top 250 Movies of All Time, and has climbed into the hearts of moviegoers across the country. Unfortunately, all of this, especially the premise of the movie itself, is completely misleading.A painfully mediocre high school student wants to make a difference in his own dull life and in the violence-ridden streets of his own city. Our antihero wants to become a superhero. The story starts off on the right note, getting us engaged and bringing on some good laughs in the process. He has no revenge story, no Martial Arts training, no money to get a hold on any cool gadgets. However, what begins as an 'unconventional' and 'original' superhero story, takes a turn and becomes the same typical, cliché, and generic superhero story it intends and claims to drift away from.By some freak accident, he acquires a damaged nerve system that significantly decreases the sensation of pain, and even gets some cool metal plates integrated into his skeleton. Cool! Like accidentally getting bitten by a radioactive spider.Then he meets Bid Daddy and Hit Girl. People love Hit Girl, and what's not to love? She's an 11-year old kid who can say bad words, dodge bullets, and kill a dozen bad guys at once. People say this movie has no gimmicks. An 11-year-old kid who can say bad words, dodge bullets, and kill a dozen bad guys at once is a total gimmick. Big Daddy is a supercop with a vendetta and Hit Girl is his daughter who has learned everything a supercop knows. They have a revenge story, and even have a ton of money which allows them to buy a bunch of fancy new weapons. Cool! Just like Batman.Sure there may be some entertainment value in it for you, (if you're into a couple masturbation scenes and an 11-year old girl getting shot at) and the acting is convincing enough, given the ridiculousness of the story. The movie only falls short in being something other than what it claims to be. 'Kick-Ass' is not 'original' (see Blankman) and is not 'unconventional' (see Spider-Man and Batman).The last I checked, at the bottom of the Top 250 List was 'Toy Story 2,' which is more than a hundred spots short of the place 'Kick-Ass' landed so quickly. If you want to see a movie that's a hundred times more original and unconventional than 'Kick-Ass', see the movie that's at the bottom of the list.",4,37,75,25 April 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Want a golden ticket? Watch this movie.
","Whether it was the nostalgia of incredible feats of imagination brought about by the original or the curiosity of witnessing Wonka's factory for the first time, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory offers sufficient amounts of creativity and humor to live up to the precedent set by the classic Willy Wonka film, and at the same time is charming enough to win the hearts of anyone witnessing its magic for the first time. Although words like 'imagination' and 'magic' may be concepts that will stray some moviegoers away, the sarcasm, wit, brutal honesty, and the ironic mocking of family movies makes 'something for everyone' a valid statement. The hardest part for any remake is of course living up to the expectations of the classic and at the same time setting itself apart from the original. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stays true to the original but surprisingly at the same time has so much more to offer.And now the necessary recap for those who have no idea what all the hype is about. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp, duh) is a recluse who hasn't seen the light of day for years, as shown in his pale complexion. Suddenly a contest is announced sending 5 golden tickets around the world granting access to his bizarre factory with only one contestant winning a lifetime supply of chocolate and a mysterious grand prize. Charlie (Freddie Highman, Finding Neverland) is a young boy with grand hopes but a tiny grotesque house where the soup of the day everyday is cabbage soup. His emotions are in a whirl as Golden Tickets quickly run out and his bedridden relatives debate more and more regarding the issue of finding a golden ticket.All of this may be deja vu to some, but Tim Burton's vision, Johnny Depp's talent, and John August's memorable screenplay should not be overlooked. Besides the change in title, this really is a different movie. An obvious change from the original over thirty years later, is the advancements in special effects. The classic Wonka movie was an amazing display of innovation considering its time period. With our age of computer generated imagery, movies can either look breathtaking or they can look like crap. Tim Burton doesn't overuse the c.g.i. in this film thus preserving the film's beauty and focus on the characters.Another good decision was using a live actor to play the oompa loompas rather than using more c.g.i. At first I was taken aback when there was an absence of orange midgets in overalls. However, the performances by Deep Roy as all the oompa loompas were actually some of the most entertaining parts of the movie. With the wide variety of musical styles provided by Danny Elfman, Roy was able to display his true versatility: ranging from Latin dance to hip hop to 60's acid rock. The movie even points out how random and choreographed those musical numbers seemed to be. And if the musical numbers don't meet your oompa loompa fix, the movie even provides a history behind how the oompa loompas came to be employed under Willy Wonka.This leads to the next major characteristic of the film: the depth it went into the lives and personalities of each character. Everyone was perfectly casted and even the minor characters had more of a voice. The bedridden elders for example make the scenes at Charlie's home more enjoyable. In this film, Grandpa Joe isn't the only one with a voice. More detail was also put into the other kids, more personality and more depth into how they got their ticket and what they plan to do with their prize. Another noticeable difference is the presentation of Wonka from Johnny Depp compared to Gene Wilde. They both seem to be really eccentric individuals and both seem to show a lack of interest to the kids on the tour, but they also have their major differences.Johnny Depp as always delivered a classic performance and a character that sets itself apart from other roles. Wonka was depicted as a merry Mister Rogers type who also has the bitterness of Dr. Evil yet the enthusiasm of Ed Wood. Wonka seemed to take pride in his work, but at the same time lacked confidence in himself and showed signs of insecurity, often bringing out index cards for everything he wants to say- a major transition from the aggressiveness of the original Wonka. This may be attributed to the history behind Wonka and his factory which is revealed more and more as the film progresses.The film understands that they are taking on a project that is regarded as untouchable. Willy Wonka isn't the same, oompa loompas aren't orange and there is no bubbly soda that makes you float to the ceiling. This is because these are aspects of the original that are reserved for the original. Instead regard these as two separate movies. This is not a musical but instead an epic film that goes deep into the heart of the story and the characters, most importantly Willy Wonka himself.This is another Burton and Depp collaboration that won't fail to please and to entertain and to wow the audiences. If you don't care about anything I said, just know that this is a memorable movie that won't be a waste of your precious time and money. With it you'll be purchasing hilarious moments and large quantities of creativity, the very substance that made us fall in love with the world of Wonka to begin with.",8,0,3,16 July 2005
The Dark Knight," Dark Knight shines bright!!!
","After sitting in the darkest, dirtiest slums of Gotham City for a little over two and a half hours straight, I still didn't want to go home. 'The Dark Knight' was brilliant in every way. Although this is the darkest superhero movie to date, the incredible vision of Director Christopher Nolan, the captivating action sequences, the philosophical themes, and the pitch-perfect performances delivered by every member of the all-star ensemble made 'The Dark Knight' shine bright, especially, of course, the darkest performance of them all, The Joker, brilliantly played by the late Heath Ledger.Heath has just been showered with enthusiastic reviews since the early screenings. You can't help but wonder how good Heath can possibly be. After watching the screening on Wednesday, trust me, Heath is so good it's scary. You hold your breath in absolute awe with every scene he enters, and linger on his every word. You laugh along because he's hilarious, but deep down inside you are terrified. The Joker gets so deep into your psyche you find yourself rooting for the lunatic, and wondering why.Thank God Christian Bale as Batman is just as likable and just as ruthless, and we're all relieved that we still have a reason to root for the good guy. Once you get past the phony raspy voice Batman must feign to conceal his identity, you will begin to appreciate Christian Bale as the most complicated Bruce Wayne to date, faced with serious cerebral issues, whether he's struggling to find out what's best for the city, what do about his love for Rachel Dawes, and what the heck is going on in the Joker's crazy cranium.At some point in the movie, every character is faced with a seemingly simple, yet ultimately difficult decision, what's right and what's wrong. For someone like Harvey Dent, perfectly executed by Aaron Eckhart, everything can be made right. For the Joker, the whole world is wrong. Throughout the entire course of the movie, the line between right and wrong gets thinner and thinner, and what ensues is complete mayhem.'The Dark Knight' is a total package. You get an adrenaline-pumping action flick, a suspenseful crime drama, an emotional love triangle, the perfect amount of comedy, and a complete work of art. Round of applause once again for all the performances. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman are just naturally likable actors. Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal continue to impress again and again. And yes, the crowd was applauding when Tiny Lister made his appearance (aka Deebo for 'Friday' fans and Zeus for wrestling fanatics). And sigh, Heath Ledger.Jack Nicholson's Joker had a line that haunted me as I grew up watching Tim Burton's film: 'You ever dance with the devil under the pale moon light?' The new Joker introduces a new question to torment the ages: 'Why so serious?' The eerie monologue that introduces this creepy quote is sure to leave a lasting imprint in the back of your mind for years. And Heath Ledger delivers a haunting performance that will join the ranks of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal and Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, and will go down as one of the greatest villains, if not the best, ever depicted in the history of film.",10,6,14,18 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Greatest game or not, this is a great movie
","As you know 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' is about golf. I used to snicker at the over-dramatic title, but through great visual display credited to director Bill Paxton (better known for his acting in Twister and hilarious supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies) we find out that this has much more meaning than a game.Though the movie is about golf, it seems as though the sport is just the framework for what is really going on. What is really going on is a story of individuals being told they can't fulfill their dreams, be it age or social status. A conflict between a son's wishes and a father's demands. An English golf legend looking to bring the title home with the country breathing down his neck.Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a God-given talent who was never permitted to play golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the upper class 'gentlemen,' it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. What posed a greater threat was the discouragement of his father played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) who felt that playing a mere game will never improve their poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother, Francis eventually comes face to face with his idol, the golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane).More impressive than the game itself, was the movie's cinematic achievement. This proved that storytelling is successful through pure cinema. The entire movie could've been told without dialog. There are scenes in the movie that build strong suspense and powerful emotion with only pictures. In one particular scene, Francis Ouimet swings and the entire crowd turn their heads to watch the ball fly into the distance, all but the face of Harry Vardon looking intensely at Ouimet without a flinch. The ways in which the golfers visualize the course offer more aesthetic enjoyment.A pleasant supporting cast completes the whole. Peyton List plays the love interest and looks worth playing for, and Josh Flitter plays a lovable caddy that keeps Ouimet focused as the pressure bogs him down. Golf fan or not, you'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great medium to tell any story.",8,33,54,28 September 2005
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me to Hell is an Instant Horror Classic
","In the spirit of the Evil Dead Trilogy, Director Sam Raimi drags you into a world of complete insanity with this soon-to-be horror/comedy classic 'Drag Me to Hell'. The movie is everything I expected it to be: no holds barred, good old fashioned fun. It knows no bounds and goes completely over the top, and just keeps going. It's loud, imaginative, as scary as it is hilarious, and especially enjoyable to go see at the movie theaters. Sam Raimi's blend of humor and horror is unique and exciting, his timing is amazing (which is difficult enough when the two genres are separate), and you really do enjoy every minute of it.The premise is simple. A loan officer (played by the lovely Alison Lohman) is cursed by a really creepy old gypsy woman after denying her of a third extension on her mortgage payments. She visits a psychic, who tells her a very evil spirit is now after her soul and she only has three days to rid herself of this black curse. Justin Long plays her immensely supportive and incredibly wealthy boyfriend. He is a realist who believes her experiences are merely the product of post-traumatic stress, but is willing to accept the notion of supernatural forces if it helps her.The movie does not take itself too seriously, like many horrible horror movies tend to do. Instead, the movie plays like one of those walk-through haunted houses you visit during Halloween, or those creepy carnival rides with spooks that make you jump at every corner, for the sole purpose of keeping you fully entertained. 'Drag Me to Hell' makes it fun to go the movies, and it will definitely endure as a great feature for decades of horror movie nights to come. Ultimately, 'Drag Me to Hell' is just a classic campfire horror story, and Sam Raimi just so happens to be one of the greatest storytellers of our time.",10,2,6,7 June 2009
Up," 'Up'-Lifting
","The masterminds behind the mysterious walls of Pixar Animation have the strangest ability to transform the simplest ideas into the most poignant stories of our time. They do not disappoint this time around, as they take you on an aerial odyssey to South America in a floating house. I know we say this every year, but this is arguably the best Pixar film yet, and quite possibly one of the best films of all time, period.'Up' tells the amazing story of Carl Fredrickson, a retired balloon salesman who refuses to surrender his house to the demands of urban expansion. On the surface is a little old man who is stubborn, apathetic, uncooperative, and bitter with age. But beyond the rigid face, the white head of hair, and bulky glasses is an aging man who is suffering from loneliness, unable to part with the house he once shared with the love of his life. He met her when he was a goofy little boy, and she was a spunky little girl, and together they shared a lust for adventure inspired by the great explorer Charles Muntz. The history of Carl and his wife Ellie is told through one of the most moving opening sequences in recent memory. Translation: I may have shed a tear or two.Lucky for us, Russell, an enthusiastic Junior Wilderness Scout, comes around to mend our broken heartstrings in hilarious fashion, as his youthful innocence is quickly countered by Carl's old indifference, and vice versa. What they do share, however, is determination. Russell will do anything to assist the elderly and become a Senior Wilderness Scout, and Carl will do anything to find Paradise Falls and finish his late wife's Adventure Book. Their interaction is classic, a relationship that both child and adult are likely to enjoy.As always, Pixar does a fine job of suspending our disbelief in a way that is strangely acceptable. The flying house, for example, is a simple network of balloons sprouting out of the chimney, with the strings tightly fastened to the fireplace. To steer the flying vessel, shower curtains serve as the sails and a crank tied to the weather vain is the helm, while a garden hose works as the anchor. The idea is incredible, but works wonderfully in the reality of the story, as Carl in his youth often had trouble preventing his balloon cart from floating off the ground.While the movie is obviously fantasy, it touches on issues and emotions that are very real and very dark. 'Up' serves as a reminder that adventure is out there, even in the boring stuff we take for granted in everyday life, and therein lies the real answer to overcoming our darkest times.'Up' is original, funny, inspirational, beautifully animated, and full of surprises, as all Pixar films tend to be. Even an old bit like talking dogs is used in a way that is different and really entertaining. Fortunately for me, I only watched 'Up' in 2D, and have an excuse to come back and enjoy once again, the magical adventure of Carl Fredrickson and the little flying house that could. Adventure is out there! And on my list of cinematic adventures, 'Up' is way up there.",10,2,6,30 May 2009
Les Misérables," The Miz is the Bizness
","The life of Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is best summed up in the words of another beloved street rat, 'All this for a loaf of bread?'From that single loaf, we become witness to an epic game of cat-and- mouse (between Wolverine and The Gladiator), the birth of a revolution, and a gut-wrenching performance from Anne Hathaway you won't ever forget.The movie was filmed in five months, and is the first musical film adaptation to record the audio live, rather than have the actors lipsync over a pre-recorded studio track. Tom Hooper's decision to film the actors live evokes some of the most powerful scenes in recent memory, particularly from Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, both deserving of Oscar nods. His use of extreme close-ups (REALLY extreme close-ups) and long, uninterrupted takes gives a raw, gritty quality to the film that brings out the true pain and suffering of the Miserable.While there is much that goes on in this sweeping tale involving the excitement of an uprising, and a short-lived love triangle not unlike the one in Victor Hugo's other masterpiece The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the story is all about redemption, and redemption comes in the form of Jean Valjean. He spent 20 years in captivity, and his only crime was being a good uncle: he stole a loaf of bread to feed his starving nephew. Those 20 years moved Jean Valjean to lose faith. The real story of Les Miserables is Jean Valjean's quest to find it again.Problem is, the road to recovery is blocked by the lawman Javert (Russell Crowe), who forces Valjean to play Catch Me If You Can a la Frank Abagnale. Like the nugget that won't flush, Javert keeps coming back. He suffers from a classic case of hubris, and refuses to see Valjean as anything more than a criminal. The only thing that keeps Valjean going is Colette, I mean, Cosette (Isabelle Allen/Amanda Seyfried).While Allen is absolutely adorable as young Cosette, and worth fighting for, Seyfried shines in the role of the woman Cosette has come to be, her voice so angelic you soon forget she used to predict the weather with her boobs. While Javert represents Pride, the only obstacle in Valjean's road to redemption, Cosette serves as Hope and the only guiding light. Valjean takes it upon himself to raise Cosette, after discovering he inadvertently led Cosette's mother's life to ruin.Not since Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta has any female performance looked so tragic yet so beautiful as Anne Hathaway in her role as Fantine. As brief as her appearance was in the film, she killed the role and stole the show. If Anne Hathaway doesn't get an Oscar, I will shave my head.How did they deliver such an ambitious film in so little time? For one they had the right crew. The composers and lyricists of the original musical were heavily involved with production. It also helps to have Tom Hooper as Quarterback. Hooper was masterful in telling a simple story about a king with a speech impediment, and is the perfect captain to helm the ship that takes us on a voyage of so many emotions. There's even ample room for humor provided by Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, which was much needed in a story so miserable. They both have big names and have the effortless ability to bring big laughs. The same can be said for the entire cast. Not the big names and the big laughs part, but the effortlessness in their abilities to know their roles and to own them. Did I mention Anne Hathaway deserves an Oscar?Catwoman and Wolverine in one of the most epic musicals of all time. Who'da thunk it? At least we're already used to seeing Jackman with Mutton Chops. Too bad Jean Valjean can't Berserker Barrage his way out of this tragedy. He does, however, have the power to heal himself, only it takes much, much longer. He heals himself through humility, through forgiveness, and through moving musical soliloquies that show us how powerful we can be even when we are most miserable.",10,0,1,9 January 2013
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," He will love it. She will love it. Jen will despise it.
","As an action movie, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is explosive with trigger happy gun brawls. As a romantic comedy this movie is as charming and as funny as any Meg Ryan Tom Hanks collaboration. This movie has the ability to meet the needs of all types of moviegoers, but be advised to leave the kids at home.The movie opens with our couple at a marriage counseling session that updates with the progression of the movie and the status of their relationship, which turn out to be some of the most hilarious parts of the movie. Mr. and Mrs. Smith like any marriage, has its secrets. But to Mr John Smith and Mrs Jane Smith, these secrets can be deadly. At home they lead the normal lives as all couples do: agree with or disregard his sense of interior decoration, like or pretend to like her homemade cooking. At the office they lead, not just secret lives, but top secret lives as Mr and Mrs Smith both turn out to be top hit men (or woman) at two different organizations. However, after getting assigned the same mark, they get involved in each other's business and soon after get their new assignments: each other... developing into a dangerous, and hilarious relationship.The premise may seem like True Lies without the Austrian Accent. True Lies also showcased a superspy whose secret life intertwined with his personal life. What sets Mr and Mrs Smith apart is less focus on their missions and more focus on their interaction and the suspense and hilarity of their relationship's development.Doug Liman has definitely come a long way since the independent days of Swingers. However, even with his move from Swingers and Go to his bigger scale movies of Bourne Identity and Mr and Mrs Smith, he maintains his keen ability to connect with the audience. In other words, despite the bright lights and razzle dazzle, for lack of a better term, necessary in an action flick, he finds room for the audience to get engaged into the characters and what will come of their relationship... of its continuity or its termination.One person who wouldn't bear to watch a single minute of this is poor Jen Aniston. Publicity stunt or not, all the tabloid gossip about Mr and Mrs Smith off camera has definitely helped it in the box office. But more importantly the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie on screen set the foundation for the movie, and without that chemistry the movie wouldn't have worked. Both actors have proved to be tremendously talented actors (See Fight Club and Girl Interrupted) not to mention eye candy... I'd sell my soul for one night with Angelina and I'm not afraid to admit that anyone would kill to have abs like Brad.Their chemistry, acting ability, and sexual appeal were all necessary for this movie to work. Imagine if instead they clashed like Mr Smith played by Tom Cruise and Mrs Smith played by, I don't know Katie Holmes? Or if their acting needed polishing like Hayden Christensen alongside Paris Hilton. And not to say anything about their sex lives, but what if they had the sex appeal of Horatio Sanz with Chyna. No nothing else seems to work. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were made for this movie.With a duo of that magnitude, this movie was certain to be a hit. It was refreshing to find that it wasn't misleading and that Mr and Mrs Smith delivered a package that was able to charm you, hold you in suspense, make you laugh hysterically, and make you want to wet your pants and make out with the girl next to you.I can't think of anything wrong about this movie. Whether your fix is gunfire and cracking necks or if its enchanted moments and steamy sex appeal, you will be satisfied. To top it off Doug Liman reached back into the vault of the legendary Swingers world and resurrected good old T money Trent. Not only should you see it but see it again. Bring a date or two, and then tell your friends and family. This movie is classic.",8,2,5,13 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally.
","The trumpets blare for the last time as Star Wars lights up the screen for the last time in the final installment to the Star Wars legacy. Stormtroopers and Jedi Masters alike gathered opening weekend to bid their final farewells to George Lucas' staple to pop culture and world history, camping for even an months... But was it worth it?Everyone knew what Revenge of the Sith would eventually lead to, Anakin's transformation to the darkside and the Jedis' fight for survival. All we were waiting for is how George Lucas would deliver. Is Yoda still badass? Can the love between Anakin and Padmay get anymore cheesy? The answer is yes to both questions. Within this battle between good an evil was a battle within itself, a good movie and a bad movie.There were of course times that wowed the crowd. The anticipation and the hype in the atmosphere of opening night was the biggest factor in bringing out the excitement of the movie, in addition to the impressive fighting choreography. Revenge of the Sith included some of the most involved and graphic battles between the forces of the light and the darkside in the Star Wars saga. Yoda again stole the show, who remains calm and wise one minute and unleashes Jedi fury the next, and Lord Sidius looked creepier than the demon in the Exorcist. Ewen McGregor shined as master Obi Wan Kinobi who established himself as one of the greatest Jedis, while Anakin proves that he's much more cooler when he's evil.There were parts however that wasn't par to the potential George Lucas has especially on a scale as great as the Star Wars universe he created. Despite the satisfying fight scenes, the rest of the movie seemed rushed. Some poorly executed CGI scenes for example. The love between Anakin and Padmay which had potential for some powerful scenes but instead resulted in cheesy clichés. And why is the rest of the Jedi council so weak? But don't ruin the experience by reading reviews on it. If anything, it succeeds in completing the trilogy and make you compelled to relive the saga in its entirety starting from back in the good IL' days when Luke would go from whining about his power converters to facing his father in one of the most memorable on screen battles in history. The Revenge of the Sith could have ended with a stronger impact but instead it faded away. Nevertheless, its still worth the experiencing one last time.If not for yourself, do it for R2D2, who was awesome to see in action, or for James Earl Jones, who was comforting to hear as a reminder of how it all started... a long time ago... in a galaxy far far away.",8,1,3,21 May 2005
WALL·E," Pure Genius.
","Original and incredibly insightful. Heartwarming and hilarious yet surprisingly dark. With dialog almost nonexistent, Andrew Stanton (writer and director of Finding Nemo) exhibits an amazing ability to tell an intelligent and emotional narrative, relying heavily on expressive action and stunning visuals. The story of WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth class), a robot whose sole purpose is to gather up the forsaken Earth's rubble and compile it in an organized fashion, is a blatant reminder that we ultimately need to get our (keep it G-rated) act together.And of course Wall-E is not without it's special treat, an animated short that precedes the main feature. 'Presto' is equally brilliant, lovable, and fully entertaining.",10,0,2,1 July 2008
300," Explosive to the Extreme!!!
","Only the hard and strong can be called Spartan. 300 is a film that brings forth the same intensity and passion to film-making that the Spartan warriors they portray bring to the battlefield. Visually stunning frame-by-frame with sword clashing, bone crushing audio that creates the same impact to the film.The Spartans are beasts. A whole army of 300 bloodthirsty soldiers... an 8-pack of abs seems to be a mere requirement. King Leonidas is so fierce and hardcore, he makes Achilles and dare I say Maximus look like Ben and Jerry.With each fleet that King Leonidas and his army of 300 Spartans must endure, comes new surprises and new challenges that keep the audience wondering if or how they will survive. The fights are unsparingly brutal and innovative, beautifully shot. And the scenes aren't just blood, sweat and gore. Although you get all that and more, the fun is also in witnessing the different tactics the 300 use to outsmart and overpower the Persian Army. One thing that sets the 300 battle scenes from Troy, Gladiator, or Braveheart are the wide assortment of creatures they are forced to do battles with. I guarantee you will not find a goat playing a sitar in any other movie but this. I will say no more.Even the love scene is shot so intimately and passionately with the same intensity as the battle scenes. (By the way, on a side note, isn't funny how an audience giggles when there's a naked man, and goes dead silent when it's a naked woman?) Anyway...The Queen is just as powerful as the warrior king. She has the challenge of gaining the support of the rest of Greece to join in her husband's fight against the Persian Army. She's so likable and respectable, you have her back the whole way through.So far the Frank Miller series is 2 for 2! This is a film not to be missed. Yet again another theater that ended with a resounding applause. King Leonidas can now join the ranks of the other epic heroes that shoot fireballs from his eyes and lightning bolts from his arse. FREEDOOOOOOOM!!!",10,7,17,5 March 2007
Pineapple Express," Good stuff. Not the best I've had. But good stuff.
","Obviously, they were high when they made this movie. At times it works to the movie's advantage, creating really hilarious moments, and other times it leaves the movie looking sloppy.What's awesome about the Apatow productions we've grown to love is their fearlessness in being blatantly crude, yet smart, and actually pretty touching in their own silly ways. This movie was exactly that at first, but once the movie switched from comedy to action/comedy, it snowballed into a mess that could've been done a whole lot better, and maybe even funnier.Watching the previous Apatow movies, it's pretty apparent that a stoner movie is something they've been anxious to do for a long time. With their edgy sense of humor, and a touch of Mary Jane, Pineapple Express was destined to become perhaps the best stoner comedy in history. Unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to its destiny.What Pineapple Express suffers from is another case of great characters stuck in an okay movie. You got Dale (Seth Rogen) who of course smokes pot all day and has a day job passing out subpoenas in the most creative ways he can think of; Saul (James Franco), Dale's dealer who is hilariously outlandish at times, but proves to have a genuine heart, and has a day job selling and smoking pot all day; Dale's high school girlfriend Angie (played by the lovely Amber Heard), who remains devoted to Dale despite being thrown into his unfortunate predicament; Red, Saul's supplier who displays incredible resilience; and the hit men, who are just as sloppy and clumsy as the potheads they're chasing.Sounds funny, and it is, which is why I'd still recommend this movie, but the movie was only a disappointment because I strongly believe an Apatow stoner movie could have been done way better. As far as stoner movies go, I'd still pick Half Baked or Harold and Kumar over Pineapple Express. As far as action/comedy, I'd pick Hot Fuzz or Last Action Hero over Pineapple Express. As far as Apatow productions go, I'd still pick Knocked Up or Superbad or 40-year-old Virgin or Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Anchorman or Talladega Nights over Pineapple Express.Again, I'd still recommend Pineapple Express because there's no denying it's hilarious. It's like the Class Clown. He says something, and you laugh because he's always funny, even though he's had better days. Today the Class Clown just happens to be high.",8,0,3,7 August 2008
