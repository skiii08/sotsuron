The Expendables 2," Fix it now
","I was extremely disappointed, who do they think they are, how dare they replace jet li with some stupid female, I was angry the whole movie for that. Second why bother bringing in Liam if he is to die in first 10 min, would have never happened if jet li was there and not some dumb chick. You BETTER fix your mistakes in the next one. Lastly you also better leave out Chuck Norris, omg his voice is annoying. Ps why would you leave out Mickey rourke all together? Hello!!!!!!!!! We wanted to see him more than some annoying woman with Jason, didn't like her in Buffy, hated her in angel, what makes you think we'd like her in this?!?!? I could go on but for the most part the scenes with the team were great, the scenes with Bruce and Arnold where great too, keep the great, lose the garbage, and improve on the lacking and the third could break records.",6,1,2,2 December 2012
