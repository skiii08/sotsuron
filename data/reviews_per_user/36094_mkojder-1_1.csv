Alien 3," Director's Cut Is A Must See
","After getting the Alien Quadrilogy last Christmas, I must say that the actual Director's Cut version is incredibly good. The studio should have let David Fincher's version onto the screen. It's much scarier, makes more sense and is in every way superior to the theatrical release. The documentary on the making of this film is just incredible, you really get an inside view in the making of this film. From the conception, to the completion - battles with executives and producers.I think David Fincher was screwed by the studios, but still got an incredible film out eventually - check out the boxed set. I think you'll find your money well spent!",10,3,7,30 December 2004
