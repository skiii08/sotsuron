Million Dollar Arm," They made my day !!
","I think this movie is one of the bests ever! . The small details about the two kids life and there actions first time in America are perfect . Also, I loved JB's feelings and thoughts changing .Brenda was very ideal , I fill in love with her character . After all , the best thing is positive energy that the story gives to you .. it's very cheering :). I would never be bored watch this again , and I hope one day meet Dinesh and Rinku <3 ..",10,0,0,3 November 2017
3 Idiots," One of the greatest
",I can't explain my feelings It's really one of the greatest movies I saw in my life. That perfect combination of fun and learn that's the life and that what we need in it. My review maybe a silly short one but I believe it's an honest one.. like the movie just jumping into your hurt and mind.. That kind of art I wanna to make and see.,10,0,0,23 March 2020
