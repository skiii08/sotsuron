Frost_Nixon," Great Acting makes for a Great Movie
","Frost/Nixon is quite possibly one of the best takes on political scandals I have seen in quite a long time. This movie does a fantastic job on characterization of both Nixon and Frost and displays the tension, importance and social breakdown of the era in a fantastic way.The story really keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch the build up of the interviews and the gathering of information, to the actual interviews where Nixon and Frost deliver great debates from both sides. From the start of the movie everyone knows what to expect for the ending and the suspense of getting there and the emotions put into Nixon's character make the conclusion much better then anyone could go in expecting even if they know the outcome of the interviews already.Unfortunately, I can't really see anyone whose not actually interested in the Watergate scandal or the Frost/Nixon interviews finding this movie as phenomenal as I do. The bottom line, I think everyone who has a feeling for history, acting and a good scandal will greatly appreciate this movie.",7,2,4,24 December 2008
