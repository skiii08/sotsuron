The Lobster," Great idea - terrible execution
","The message this movie was sending about society and singles and couples etc was all great. 10/10 message. The movie itself however was utter garbage. I understand the deadpan way of speaking was supposed to be part of the 'dark humour' but it got old real fast. That's only one of the many issues with this movie. I gave it a 3 because the first half was ok, it kept my attention enough with an interesting set up. But once it moved outside the hotel I was on my phone playing apps, waiting for it to be over. It's a pretentious, artsy fartsy movie that tries way too hard to be clever.",3,2,3,26 January 2019
Get Out," Do people really like this movie or do they just think they should?
","I'm white, so I realise I should be giving this movie somewhere between a 7-10 rating to appear as woke as possible, but c'mon, this was pretty garbage... So many plot holes. So many silly moments. Took itself way too seriously. The two leads were ok, did a decent job. The rest of the actors I found incredibly annoying, especially the brother of the girlfriend. Definitely not the worst movie I've seen, but NOT worthy of the hype and high ratings.",3,35,58,3 March 2019
