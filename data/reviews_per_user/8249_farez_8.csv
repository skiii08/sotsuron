Ford v Ferrari," One of two best Racing Films ever...
","My review for Ron Howard's 'Rush' enthusiastically placed it at the top of the heap for 'racing genres' if that is such a thing. That film was excellent even if you are not a racing fan.Well now that I have seen 'Ford vs Ferrari', I am having a difficult time choosing which one is better. I'm going to lean towards Ford v Ferrari because of the performance by Christian Bale as it is fresh in my mind and certainly a great character and acting job. I love his rebelliousness and genuine love for the machine...the way he communicates with it intuitively as if it was alive, Iis great stuff. At first I didn't think Matt Damon was cast well for the part of Carroll Shelby. From what I know (and I did meet him once) he was more of an outspoken cowboy, but I have to say Damon was excellent and his performance grew on me. Not as good as Bale who stole the show, but still excellent. The Lee Iacocca character was also slightly miscast but still, a very entertaining performance.I liked how the period corporate culture of the US car industry was portrayed, with strong personalities and business practices of that era. It was especially entertaining when the Ford boys were they trying to match wits against Enzo Ferrari.As to the racing and car stuff, it was great. Period authenticity was respected even in the scenes in France. The growling soundtrack and sweeping score just works. I enjoyed the innovative camera work of the racing scenes. The Ford GT40 was a miracle of brute American know-how against the refined Italian machinery of the legendary Ferraris.Based on factual history (with a little artistic license thrown in), the story is compelling and left me very satisfied.In my opinion, 'Rush' and 'Ford V Ferrari' are the two best racing movies ever.",9,1,2,6 February 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dead Man's Plot
","I enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean film very much for Depp's engaging and brilliantly entertaining portrayal of a mischievous pirate captain and his gritty crew. The rest of the cast was great (Rush, Knightley and Bloom) and overall that was the best pirate film since the classics of the 1940's and 50's.Unfortunately the sequel Dead Man's Chest really sucks. This is a comic book without the heroes. If you like comic book movies, Spiderman and X-Men were way better and much more intellectual.Sure the effects were ambitious and at times impressive, and the island scenes pretty, but the natives were goofy rather than intimidating and the whole aftertaste was all like a nightmare rather than a dreamy fun adventure.The plot is convoluted. The script dumb. The storyline unbelievable and the special effects over the top and aimed at the Saturday morning cartoon demographic. Even with the same previously excellent cast, the acting is sub-par. Depp's performance is lackluster. He stretches his old character awkwardly without introducing anything new and his humor is less funny the second time around. I don't think it's his fault, it's just that the producers wanted sequel cash and spent their energy on effects and not on a script or a story. While the first film had some authenticity to it even with its fantasy visuals, this film seems to be aimed only at 12 year olds who want to see lots of slime and monsters. Who cares about an intellectual dialog? I was extremely disappointed and am no longer looking forward to the next sequel which is so unabashedly teased at the anticlimactic end.I'm sorry but this film drops the baton. When is someone going to make a real pirate film with historically authentic villains and Das-Boot realism? Today's technology should be used to help a film not hurt it. I want to see authentic villains like Rackham the Red or the fierce Blackbeard who would drink grog and gunpowder, and light matchsticks in his beard to scare the enemy. That's way cooler than an octopus head or hermit crab face. Imagine what could have been done with a realistic evil captain who steals the gold and the lovely love interest...anyway I digress.This film is like a video game without the joystick.I wish Davy Jones' locker had never been disturbed.",4,2,3,10 December 2006
Moana," Beautiful and expressive with lush visuals and great music.
","One of the better Disney classics I have seen in some time. Maybe a bit much for kids under 7, but it has a lot of appeal for most ages.The characters have a lot personality and their expressive faces are really amazing. The score and songs are surprisingly catchy. What really stood out for me is the gorgeous ocean (which plays a central character), in all of its colors and moods. Idyllic beaches, clear aquamarine lagoons, Starry skies, violent waves, lightning storms and stunning luminescent scenes abound.There is an underlying mother earth wisdom which tries to surface while teaching us about early Pacific culture, mythology and their history as ocean voyagers. The main character Moana is equally wonderful as a curious toddler (utterly cute), and as the young heroin who musters the courage to carry on the destiny of her ancestors. Her Demi-God sidekick Maui is also a great character.I have had a lot of reservations with some of Disney's more recent productions, as they tend to be more trendy and less traditional, but this one manages to have progressive sensibilities while maintaining that high standard we expect.",8,0,2,13 May 2017
Rush," Best Racing Film of All Time?
","It's been so long since I've seen 'Le Mans' with Steve McQueen, and 'Grand Prix' with James Gardner, that I am reserving judgment on 'Rush' as the greatest racing film of all time. I'm going to have to see them again, but there is no doubt that 'Rush' is a serious contender, and certainly the winner in the last few decades (sorry Tom Cruise).It becomes especially compelling when you understand that the events depicted are largely as they really happened. This Ron Howard film faithfully captures the story of two distinct personalities rising to the top for the 1976 Formula One season.James Hunt, the good looking free spirit playboy with raw talent, and Niki Lauda, the brilliant technician. Their opposite approaches to winning makes for a fascinating rivalry and pulls you in where you actually care for both drivers and you respect them equally for different reasons. Both drivers have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they share a wicked competitive spirit that tests them to the edge of their lives.Aside from excellent character development, the sights and sounds of both the cars and the era are convincingly captured. Sexy interludes, a dynamic soundtrack, and lush imagery compliments this film to make it a gripping experience even for those of you who have no passion for auto racing.It's a true story, a good film, and a great racing movie.",8,2,5,18 November 2018
1917," Ambitious and Effective Soldier's Experience
","As far as war movies go, this one is different. My only criticism might be the total lack of humor. As expected, It is certainly not a comedy, but lighthearted humor doesn't even come into the fray.I thought the seamless continuous shot might be a gimmick that would bridal the film (I don't really see the need to avoid edits), but for this film, it is very effective. It pulls you in with our main character and as the film progresses, so does the immersion and the tension. You really do feel like you are experiencing everything as a witness.On top of that, the cinematography is very ambitious....sometimes beautiful.There are metaphors of the contrasts between innocence and aggression. They are well done and poignant. The score is grandiose if not a bit over the top, but it will undoubtedly allow your tears to well.The acting is beyond reproach and the aftertaste is respect. We've all seen a lot of war movies. This one is less about bravado and more about humanity. Our hero is not the typical bad-ass, but rather a young man who is pretty much obliged against his instinct to complete a mission not only because he's following orders, but mostly for honor and his own soul. In that way, he becomes a hero.Well done with some memorable scenes I will likely never forget.",8,8,12,6 February 2020
It's a Wonderful Life," This Film is a Life Changer
","Everyone has heard of this film, and if you haven't seen it, it's probably because you live in Antarctica or you have purposely avoided watching an old corny rerun in black and white. I command you to watch it, and if you have a heart, you will cry with joy. This film has endured as a timeless classic for 70 years for good reason. This film is pure art because it taps into the human experience in such an effective way. The message that we are all important is simply and beautifully brought to life. Jimmy Stewart's performance is human, funny, poignant and brilliant. Do not look for subtlety, clever meanings, high drama, modern art, political correctness, special effects, sex scenes, or car chases. You won't even see any color (avoid the colorized version at all costs), but what you will find is a perfect little film that will stay with you forever. This film represents the very best of what America wants to be at its core. I appreciate high brow multi-million dollar productions as much as any other film geek/ movie buff, but this film always brings me home because it reminds me of what really matters in life. Watch it and savor every wholesome corny second of it. If you don't feel something, you are not human.",10,5,9,6 December 2015
Vanilla Sky," Good brain food
","Tom Cruise gets on my nerves with his preachy self, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he is a pretty good actor and in this film he shines. Have not seen the Spanish film 'Open Your Eyes' of which this is a remake, but this one was good enough for me to want to see it as well. Is it a love story? Not really, a sci-fi? Not really, a drama? kinda sorta, but really it's all of the above and shouldn't be categorized.The story although seemingly convoluted at first, stretches your mind and starts to make more sense as you realize Cruises' affliction is causing him some heavy head trips. Cruise holds his own as the central character carrying quite an acting burden as a self centered but likable rich boy, a total victim of circumstance, and a love smitten puppy to the amazingly attractive Penelope Cruz.Cameron Diaz has always been a favorite of mine: expressive and playful with an edge, and here she excels in the role. Penelope Cruz actually is her perfect antithesis: secure, natural, grounded, and utterly irresistible, which gives her enough power to convince us that even studly Tom Cruise had met his match.Enough said, can't say too much, but the story concept is very interesting and although at first I probably wouldn't have rented this film even upon recommendation, I am glad that I experienced it. Don't let anyone explain the concept. Let it reveal itself to you.",7,0,1,22 May 2006
Amélie," A Must See Film that Swells with Creative Genius and Personality
","I resisted this film for years for no good reason. I'm a guy and I'm not prioritizing my time for romantic comedies, but now that I have experienced it (more than once might I add), I consider it to be one of my top 10 favorites of all time. It is the story of an outcast girl who finds meaning by doing crazy little favors for strangers. It's her contribution to the world that gives her stark life purpose. But what is so engaging about this film is the manner of humorous style, colorful characters, artful camera work, editing and overall creative genius that really sets it apart. It has an overall quirky personality that puts it in a category of its own. It is relentlessly droll and funny, and it confidently opens little charming surprises that are touching. Perhaps it's a stretch but if you enjoyed 'Raising Arizona' with Nick Cage by the Cohen brothers (another favorite, but not quite to this level), you will probably love this film for some of its similar originality and styling cues. I happen to be French so I have an extra appreciation for the nuances that the original dialogue brings, but the subtitles are well translated and my friends have all thanked me for turning them on to Amelie. This film is a gem.",9,0,1,6 December 2015
