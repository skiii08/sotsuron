Raiders of the Lost Ark," Asps; Very Dangerous.
","Review #5 of 'My Top Ten Favorite Movies' Reviews 'Spielberg can never top this. Period.' - Luke Y. Thompson, Dallas Observer Luke is right. This is the best Spielberg film as of yet. I don't believe he can top this. The movie's charm and adventure just captivate you and fully engage you in the movie. It works like clockwork.This film combines adventure, greed, power, love, Nazis, Harrison Ford at his best, and many other things to make the best adventure film ever made.All the actors seem to enjoy their roles, and I especially love Paul Freeman's crazy French archaeologist character, Belloq.There are many iconic scenes here; the boulder chase scene, the plane explosion, the U-boat scene, the 'kidnapped Marion' scene, the 'Indy-shoots-the-guy-with-the-sword' scene, and of course the melting faces scene. I could go on and on. You will like every moment of this movie, and will want more. Since you want more, you have 3 almost-as-good sequels to watch!

Gravity," A Cinematic Experience Like No Other
","There is no other film experience on Earth like Gravity. Which makes sense, keeping in mind the whole movie was located in space, with only the ending scene being on Earth.Alfonso Cuaron has struck gold with his masterpiece Gravity. It explores the silence of space where all you can hear are your breaths and your thoughts as you spin around aimlessly. This is usually harmless until a crisis like debris comes into play. From then on, Sandra Bullock puts on an amazing performance which will definitely give her an Oscar nod, and George Clooney is his usual affable self.One thing that really defined this movie's greatness was its careful attention to being realistic. From the tears slipping down Sandra Bullock's cheeks actually floating off her face, to the oxygen in her suit depleting at a steady rate, this movie doesn't look over any detail or flaw. Instead, it uses simplicity and directness to flow the movie along. Nothing was that unbelievable in this movie.Even though sound was a luxury in this movie, the emotional side of the film was not. Confined to tight spaces, Bullock couldn't really do anything to hide her emotions. She couldn't run anywhere to hide, or walk into a different room. Instead, we all saw and felt what she was going through, and actually cared about what happening to her character.Another thing this movie did that was great was switch perspectives of the camera. We went from seeing what was happening from the character's eyes, to a third person view, to a wide camera angle, all in a few seconds. And the best part is, the camera was so fluent and coherent that we didn't even notice that the perspectives were changing until it actually happened. Genius filmmaking.I could go on about this things this movie did right, because to be honest I can't think of anything I didn't like in the movie, which is extremely rare. Overall, this is a new kind of cinema experience that cannot be replicated again. (Yes, that was a challenge, directors!) Everyone in the target audience and beyond should see this movie because of its realistic sense of things and its careful attention to detail. The cinematography is beautiful, and the views and perspectives this movie gives are to die for. The emotional core, themes, and moral lessons this movie offers should be soaked up with ease. And the way it draws you into the story and what's happening is truly an amazing feat.",10,5,9,20 October 2013
Oblivion," Visually Stunning,But With Some Flaws
","I debated whether seeing oblivion or Iron Man 3 the weekend I saw it. I regret my decision.Even though Oblivion isn't that bad -- with its beautiful cinematography and visually stunning images -- Iron Man would beat it any day, and it just seems kind of mainstream.Story was decent enough I guess, but there were some flaws in it and logic had to be suspended. In fact, at some scenes, i thought i was sitting in Inception! So, some of the flaws include: Morgan Freeman's character. This is the first (and hopefully last) time i will say this... Morgan Freeman was not right for this role, even though he did a good job.Plot holes.Too many silence scenes; no enough action scenes.and finally, illogical scenes and bad editing.Overall, this was a slightly too long movie that tried to be more than it was, with a mainstream story line, but very visually stunning cinematography.HandHStudios Rating:5/10",6,0,0,6 May 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Worth Watching if You Like Clint Eastwood, But Don't Expect Any Character Development.
","Possibly Eastwood's last movie, this could be a solid conclusion of his acting career.Trouble with the Curve is a good-at-best baseball drama with a star-studded cast and an interesting story. It succeeds for the most part, but a couple of flaws bring it down from what could've been an Oscar-nominated or -winning drama with Eastwood as its front man.The flaws include: - A clunky script and illogical moments. - Clint Eastwood's character almost never redeeming himself. - Repetitive, annoying fights between Adams and Eastwood's characters. and some more.Ill say the positives first. The cinematography and shots I this film were up to par: never going beyond, but never going backwards either. The acting was good, setting the standards for a movie of this caliber. The cast had a lot of Hollywood greats such as Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, John Goodman, and Justin Timberlake. I liked Timberlake the most, the only male character in the film to actually have the where-with-all and be completely sane. ;-)That being said, the film lacked many good qualities. The script was clunky and never seemed to fit in at the right moments. Of course, Eastwood had his one liners ('What are you fellas staring at, I'm not a pole dancer.'). But there was just constant fighting, and repetitive lines of dialogue between Eastwood and Adams. He would grunt, she would yell at him for not being there for her as a child, blah blah blah. The first time was acceptable, but then it just got plain tedious. And after about a minute of talking to him, she would storm out of the room, and then they would be shown together the next scene like everything was fine and dandy. There was never any redemption of Clint Eastwood's character until the very end, as if the first 45 minutes of the movie were a waste. And Justin Timberlake's character was very good; the guy can act! And even though he was a relief for the whole movie, he didn't get enough screen time to outdo the mess that Eastwood and Adams made throughout the movie. Even though it seems like I had a million things to complain about, I still recommend this movie. Why? Because, flaws aside, it meshes together baseball, Clint Eastwood, a good cast, and enough family drama to compete with the Kardashians. HandHStudios Rating: 6.7/10",7,1,2,13 August 2013
We're the Millers," A Marginally Funny Comedy With Some Love-It and Hate-It Moments
","I saw the trailer for 'We're The Millers' and two things hit me: 1. I've never seen Ed Helms (who's in this movie) in another movie besides The Hangover Series (and if I decided to see this).2. Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper.So I said 'What the hell, why not see it.' This movie wasn't as bad as some critics are saying: it had some laughable moments, and some parts fit right into the movie like a shoe. That being said, there are parts of the movie nobody asked for or wanted, and moments I didn't like.First off, this movie had a sort of funny comedic overtone, but the hard fact is that this movie's central plot was drugs, drugs, and more drugs. As David (Jason Sudeikis)says a quarter through the movie, 'This is not a smidge. You've got me moving enough weed to kill Willie f**king Nelson!' This movie is placed in the genre of comedy, but leave out all the laughs and goofy moments, and it has messages about 'family' and 'sticking together' at its core, a feat achieved by a handful of these kinds of comedies. So, there's a plus.The comedy was decent, there were a few memorable scenes that deserved a few laughs. But other than that, I wasn't laughing that much. The movie took a lot of chances, and only had a few payoffs. But as I said before, it had a deeper layer of family morals, sticking together, and so forth, which balanced out all the guilty laughs and stripper jokes.This comedy had some love-it and hate-it moments, for sure. It was really balanced in terms of how much I hated it and liked it, so I can't say there were more love-it moments, or more hate-it moments. There were some parts of the movie I can't stand, and some parts I thoroughly enjoyed.Overall, this movie had some core values of 'family morals' that redeemed its ways of slapstick humor and sexual jokes. Ironically, for an R Rated comedy focusing on drugs, this was really a 'family movie'.HandHStudios Rating: 6.4/10",6,3,7,11 August 2013
Collateral," This Movie Does Collateral Damage to Lesser Action Thrillers.
","Collateral was a good, action-packed thriller with enough taxi shots to last me a lifetime. Tom Cruise is at his best, and so is Jamie Foxx. Both actors contribute well-rounded,tough characters into a good cast, also including Javier Bodem and Mark Ruffalo. This movie had a pace that was just right, as well as a story that was gripping and fun to watch. It also gave you a feel of time, because of the 5 jobs Tom Cruise had to pull. You knew were you were in the movie based on how many were left, granted you can do math. Insummation, this was a good tale of two very different people having to put up with each other, even when guns are drawn. Jada Pinkett Smith tied the movie together, and also played the role well. The only negative thing i have to say is that it got a tiny bit slow at points, and the dialogue as well as camera shots could've been cleaned up a bit. But other than that, this is a flick worth watching.HandHStudios Rating: 7.5/10",8,0,0,12 March 2013
Elysium," If Your Looking For a Good Action Movie, This Is It
","'Elysium has spectacular visual effects, an interesting story, and a good performance by Matt Damon.' Even though Matt Damon has done some 'paycheck' movies lately (We Bought a Zoo), I believe he really wanted to do Elysium.Elysium combines great action with an interesting storyline, good acting, and enough eye candy to give you a cavity.The visual effects in this movie are stunning, and Elysium has some pretty cool gadgets to go along with it. I especially liked Damon's 'drilled-in neurological droid suit'.I didn't get Jodie Foster's accent throughout the movie, and I believe she was sort of a weak link, but it didn't really take away from the story, so I guess I can forgive the movie for that.HandHStudios Rating: 8.3/10",8,3,5,2 September 2013
Saw," Saw Left A Bad Taste In My Mouth... But That's the Point of It!
","Saw is the perfect movie for hardcore horror fans who want to see a good gory film, because Saw has more gore than a pig slaughterhouse. Seriously, I mean there's always someone bleeding profusely at some point of this film! Yet another reason fans of the genre will be enamored with Saw.Besides surpassing the average genre fare, Saw is intelligent. Unlike the usual slasher or gory pic, Saw's story is, for the most part, logically sound, although I put 'logically' very lightly. Obviously, it's not every day you wake up in a dirty abandoned bathroom chained to a pipe! For what the film was, it made relative sense. At least, it made more sense than most of the other horror flicks I've seen. The story was engaging, and very compelling. There were a few gaps in logic and minor plot holes, but that's pretty standard for any horror movie. The real logical person in that situation would either find a way out in the first 5 minutes or give up and find a way to kill themselves. But a 5 minute movie where the main character dies in the first 5 minutes wouldn't sell at the box office, would it? So the filmmakers have to suspend logic in some places to move the story along, something most critics don't understand. That doesn't make the movie bad, because believe me, if the mentioned critic saw the '5-minute Saw' I talked about before, he/she wouldn't complain about the real film at all.Moreover, Saw actually had pretty decent acting. The characters were well-rounded, and this movie was a good kick-starter for the career of Leigh Whannell. Cary Elwes, who I've seen in Twister, Princess Bride, and Robin Hood: Men In Tights, turned his usual goofy character into a serious, dramatic role as Doctor Lawrence Gordon. Desperateness loomed in his eyes the whole film, as he had no idea what was to happen to his wife and child being held captive by an unknown man he thinks is 'The Jigsaw Killer'. Danny Glover, who almost always dies in a movie, (It seems he's almost surpassed Leonardo DiCaprio in movie deaths!) takes on a detective role as Detective Tapp, obsessed with finding the Jigsaw Killer after Jigsaw kills Tapp's partner, played by Ken Leung. This film was a good watch, especially if you like horror films, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. But that was the point!HandHStudios Rating: 7.7/10",8,0,1,12 September 2013
Reservoir Dogs," Classic Tarantino... and Then Some
","Review #4 of 'My Top Ten Favorite Movies' Reviews I'm just gonna go ahead and say it: I think this movie is better than Pulp Fiction.Unlike most of the Tarantino fans, I think this movie was a little bit better than Pulp. I just liked the story and characters more.Anyway, let me talk about THIS movie.Reservoir Dogs is a timeless classic. There are no smartphones, iPads, or laptops. Just good old fashioned killing.No spoilers, the story is about a group of men who are pulling off a bank heist. But when it goes terribly wrong, they think they have a rat working for the police in their midst. This is followed by paranoia, suspicion, and rage. (I didn't differ very much from the IMDb description, so I don't believe any spoilers were revealed.) This story is very captivating, and the actors make it that way with no-bull performances. Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, and Chris Penn were all in the early stages of their acting careers, and this movie was their big break. In fact, if Harvey Keitel hadn't agreed to produce it and star in it, it probably wouldn't have even seen the light of day; or at least it wouldn't have been as big as it is now.The script is very compelling and stylish. It gives a certain edge to the movie that made it better. A lot of this movie's dialogue has been quoted many times. My point- it was a very memorable movie.Overall, you have to see Reservoir Dogs. It is a timeless classic that defined Tarantino movies for the rest of his career.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10",10,0,0,5 September 2013
Pulp Fiction," Good Tarantino Flick About Gangsters, But Not Great.
","Pulp Fiction is one of those movies I liked more in retrospect than at the time. I think Tarantino's genius does play a part in this film, and the product is substantial; but Reservoir Dogs is better.All the characters use witty, random dialogue about European hamburgers and the sexual implications of foot massages, but to what avail? I mean, as fun as it is to hear and watch, I just found that the whole movie lacked something. Maybe a little bit more editing would've done the trick; maybe it was something else. I can't quite put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong. I think this is a classic Tarantino movie. I enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson's quotable lines, as well as a couple of outstanding scenes. (The OD, the Big Date, the scene where Harvey Keitel gets rid of the body, etc.) As a whole, the movie does work. But some minor details would make it even better.The storyline of Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames was a little much. (Did Ving *really* have to get raped?) I know Tarantino just wanted to add some shock value to his film, but even for a person who doesn't mind that kind of thing in movies I found it a little extreme.Oh, and one more thing: I learned that 'zapateria' means 'shoe store' in Spanish, courtesy of Butch. ;-)HandHStudios Rating: 8/10HandHStudios",10,2,5,8 September 2013
The Departed," Scorcese Strikes Gold Again. (No Spoilers)
","I can't shake the feeling of how much this movie reminds me of 'Goodfellas'.The Departed is a slam-bam thriller, exceeding my expectations, which were already very high. The way Scorcese moves between scenes and plays this movie up is genius.The script is excellent, providing rich dialogue to move the gripping story along, and the cinematography is just wonderful. The angles and style of filming that Martin Scorcese is famous for emanates here, shining brighter than films of kin.The acting is just amazing, with a star-studded cast that delivers the goods, and then some. I enjoyed Matt Damon in the title roll, and Leonardo DiCaprio trails right behind him. Jack Nicholson brings charisma to the roll of Frank Costello, and executes with Oscar-worthy style. I especially liked Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin's loose cannon-like characters. They provided a stunning edge to an already sharp blade of a film.I can go on and on about everything else that is good in this movie, how it all clicks together, but I suggest you watch it for yourself if you haven't already, and find out what all the hype is about! I would give it more than 100 if I could.HandHStudios Rating: 11/10 :-)",10,0,2,11 August 2013
Die Hard," Why Die Hard Defined the Action Genre
","Review #2 of 'My Top Ten Favorite Movies' Reviews In 1988, when Die Hard came out, my parents and a family friend went to see it in New York City in a big theater. The movie was so crowded, they all did not even get to sit together. (And I don't even think it was opening weekend!) Take that into consideration for how big a movie this was back then and still is.Die Hard is the best action movie, and probably my favorite movie, with a close second or tie with The Shawshank Redemption.Die Hard combines well-executed action scenes with cheesy but iconic one-liners and a great main character. As sarcastic, profane, and messed up John McClane is, you have to find yourself rooting for him.Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, and Bonnie Bedelia, Reginald Veljohnson, and many others will have their acting skills defined by this movie forever. After all, it definitely gave a career boost to some, although Willis already had a nice acting resume on his plate. Nevertheless, it redefined the whole genre.Action movies consist of a bunch of key elements that come together to form a coherent picture. (At least I hope it will be coherent, as some tend to fail at this process.) They combine action scenes (obviously), at least a couple one-liners, a car (there's always a car or some kind of vehicle), a villain, and usually an explosion or two. Or three. ;-) All of these elements and many more were all in Die Hard, and it kind of changed the genre for good. You will hear people say 'Oh, that movie is a Die Hard rip-off', or 'That stunt was first made famous in Die Hard.' It's not that action movies didn't have these elements before Die Hard, it's just that Die Hard made them better and/or famous.Die Hard will keep you on the edge of your seat, and is an extremely well-done picture that doesn't lag or slow down at all. It eases into the action in such a way that it feels natural and not forced or unnecessary.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10",10,3,3,5 September 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," A Closer Look at Shawshank's Genius
","Review #1 of 'My Top ten Favorite Movies' Reviews I'm not going to go through a whole review, since there are plenty of reviews detailing why this is the greatest movie of all time. I'm just gonna give a quote:'The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen because of its ability to capture raw emotion.' I'm also going to elaborate on the three biggest reasons people dislike this movie.1. It's too slow.The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion.Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing 'Kumbaya'? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.3. This is not realistic.Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10, and everything higher.",10,0,0,5 September 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Director Christopher Nolan Strikes Again.
","The best installment of the Batman trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises is involving, gripping, and riveting. The story is on par, as well as a great cast new to the series (Tom Hardy, Anne Hathaway, Marion Cotillard, etc.). The movie never lags, and Tom Hardy's Bane comes across as a testosterone-fueled hunk of a man who knows true pain and wants to do justice in his own twisted ways.While some may say that the background story of Bane isn't what's in the comics, just stop. Did it fit the movie? Maybe it didn't, because I bet my ass director Christopher Nolan took that into consideration. I bet they did a screen test, and that storyline didn't work. To be honest, it's not that big of a detail and can be easily overlooked, and it didn't do any damage to the story. In fact, it made it *that* much more interesting.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10",10,6,10,19 September 2013
Amélie," Even in French, I Could Connect With Amélie!
","I watched Amélie with English subtitles, since I do not speak French. If I can connect and understand a movie so well, even when the dialogue spoken is in a different language, then that is the mark of true genius.Although this is a foreign film, it didn't feel awkward or messy, like some other foreign films I've seen. Instead, it played out well with a moving soundtrack and beautiful cinematography. The shots of Paris were breathtaking, and the acting was very well done. Love was in the air in this film, with some very funny and erotic scenes entailing. The dialogue, although in French, was still very well-spoken and had a sharp wit to it. I don't want to give more away if I don't have to, so I'll just say don't take your kids to this film until they're at least 16 or so ;-)HandHStudios Rating: 9.3/10",9,0,1,29 August 2013
Looper," An Annoying Plot Shift Ruins a Could've-Been 10/10 Movie
","Looper starts out great. The plot is fresh and original, the acting is pretty good, Joseph Gordon Levitt looks a hell of a lot like an actual young Bruce Willis, and the movie goes from there, with JGL trying to chase his 'future self' through the present. This movie is complex, but once you hit Nirvana with the idea, like Inception, you will understand everything.As Levitt chases his future self through the world, he stumbles across a farmhouse, and there lies Emily Blunt. From that point in the movie --a little under halfway-- the plot shifts, and is all about Blunt's son. (I won't spoil what happens anymore).I hated this plot shift as the focus of the movie veered off the side of the road of getting to the intended finale. other than this, the movie isn't half bad.HandHStudios Rating: 7.2/10",7,1,2,17 September 2013
Fast Five," Great Racing and Action Flick
","I've seen the rest of the Fast and the Furious movies, and hoped this one was going to be just as good. And it was! In fact, i liked this one better than the original! It had great action, thrills, and was the same kind of story as the other ones. Of course, i have to comment on the undeveloped story, flat characters, and unrealistic parts of the movie. Of course, i knew i was going to have to suspend disbelief going in, but some of the sequences of action in this movie were too hard to overlook. They fall from a 1000 ft high bridge, plummeting into water, but of course, they are okay! Also, the plot and acting was iffy. This is a generic action thriller with lots of one-liners and car crashes. But that's all that we came for right? So that makes it a little bit better. If car chases, thrills, and kills are your criteria that you look for in movies, then definitely see this one. You won't be disappointed.HandHStudios Rating: 6.2/10",6,0,1,19 March 2013
Gangs of New York," Gripping, Riveting, Undeniably Good; Until the Final Third
","Gangs of New York had my eyes glued to the screen as an amazing, stunning, historical piece to Martin Scorcese's filmography, until the final third of the movie where it fell a little flat. The plot twists and smooth storytelling Scorcese is famous for just went into thin air. I don't want to spoil the movie, but after a major scene between Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio, the movie gets a little banal and dried up until one of the very last dramatic scenes. The pace and the throbbing heart that kept this movie alive just suddenly fails to keep going. The story slows down, and not much happens for a while. Now, don't get me wrong; this 'final third' isn't the worst part of a movie I've ever seen. It's just that compared to the rest of the movie, this part lags and is a touch dry.Other than that, this is a great movie with a talented cast and a great director. The story isn't all that complicated, but Scorcese's great filmmaking talents pull it off and make it interesting. It is for all I can see historically accurate, and it really has the feel of the violence and desperation of that time period. This is officially the second best role of Daniel Day-Lewis, in my opinion. (The first being Lincoln, of course (; ) HandHStudios Rating: 7.5",8,0,0,15 August 2013
Goodfellas," Goodfellas- Better Than The Godfather?
","Review #3 of 'My Top Ten Favorite Movies' Reviews Goodfellas is a 'true' picture; unlike some mob movies, it doesn't glorify organized crime, per se, it captures it perfectly on-screen.The key in the success of Goodfelas is the dialogue. The script is just absolutely amazing. As profane and raw as it is, it really gives you a glimpse of how gangsters actually work and what they actually do. There's no denying the realistic nature of the film and how Scorcese's genius puts this film on the same level as 'The Godfather', if not better.The characters in this movie are captivating. De Niro's calm, collected character is offset by Pesci's loose cannon, loud-mouthed performance. Pesci definitely deserved the Oscar he won for this role, as he plays a character that is sick, as shown by his actions, yet likable all the same. That just shows what a great actor Pesci is.Liotta gets Henry Hill down perfectly. His performance is one of the best in his whole acting career. He is innocent, yet violent; quiet, yet he has a temper at times; calm, yet crazy; his personality contradicts itself throughout the movie, yet this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it makes his character *that* much more interesting to watch.Overall, this Oscar Winning, highly acclaimed picture deserves all the hype it gets: it's smart, realistic, and raw. These elements combine to form one of the best Gangster movies ever made. And yes, I think it is even better than 'The Godfather'.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10",10,0,1,5 September 2013
