Blade Runner 2049," Waste of time
","I got suckered into BLADE RUNNER 2049 because some 'profound' critics described it as a 'search for identity'. Baloney. It has the intellectual depth of a 9-year-old. The production creates a giant dome and then fills it with peanuts--a story so simple it can be summarized in less than 1/2-page. Ryan Gosling is amazingly flat- lined--and through all his trials and fights, his hair is never out of place, as if made out of cast-iron. Once Harrison Ford comes on the scene, the contrast highlights how shallow Gosling's acting is in this film. Also, at over 2-1/2 hours, I was amazed at how many non- sequiturs there were: 'How did we get from here to there?' I asked far too many times. Also, there is nothing new here, nothing creative or imaginative that I didn't see in the 17 minutes of previews of 6 or 7 other IMAX films full of explosions, post-nuclear landscapes, yada- yada-yada. This was a waste of money; worse, it was a waste of time. Recently I spent 2- 1/2 hours in an airport because of a late flight-- at least I read a good book during those 150+ minutes.",2,7,15,17 October 2017
