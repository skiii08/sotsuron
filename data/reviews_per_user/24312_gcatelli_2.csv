Walk the Line," perhaps best movie scene i've ever viewed
","'Walk the Line' has one of the finest scenes i've ever seen in any movie. toward the end, we see Johnny hosting a family gathering. now that he's been off substances for awhile and been behaving like a responsible husband and father, Cash and his pappy are finally reconciled.Cash's two young daughters are trying to talk to their grandfather through styrofoam cups attached by a string. but, neither they nor their grandfather can hear anything through the cups, because the string is hanging loose.Johnny explains to his pappy that the string has to be pulled taut for it to conduct sound between the cups. Johnny then walks away, suggesting his pappy tell his granddaughters a story.the father, looking utterly perplexed, says he doesn't know any stories. Johnny shoots back: why don't you tell 'em about the time you built a boat and saved your family from a flood? (the incident inspired the Cash tune 'Five Feet High and Rising'.) this scene revealed the source of what had up until then been the father's lifelong resentment of the son. every boy in America knows the string has to be pulled taught to carry sound between two cups. the only conclusion to be drawn from the father's ignorance of this simple fact of childhood is that he had been too poor to have had a childhood. growing up in the Mississippi Delta, the father probably started working in the cotton fields around age 5 (the same age as his son Johnny later would).but, by contrast with his father, Johnny had never wanted to do anything but play. he was fishing instead of helping his brother when the older boy (their father's favorite) was killed in an accident cutting wood at the saw mill. as an adult Johnny hadn't worked at a regular job -- he played the guitar instead. when he wasn't playing the guitar, he was playing around with alcohol, drugs, and women he wasn't married to.being of Scottish descent, the father was the sort of man who'd have preferred having boiling oil poured into his ear, rather than ever brag about himself. whereas Johnny's career was about self-promotion, to the point of wanting fans to think of him as some kind of career outlaw, which disgusted the father.so, even though the father was the kind of man who, like Noah, had saved his family by building a boat with the flood waters rising, when asked he couldn't think of any story to tell -- just the opposite of Johnny.an incredibly rich, yet economical, scene.",10,3,4,30 September 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," the most shamefully dishonest movie i've ever seen
","'Goodnight and Good Luck' is shown in gorgeous black and white. i would see the film again just to enjoy the cinematography.however, beyond aesthetics, i think another reason for the use of b&w was to emphasize the filmmakers' dishonest portrayal of the controversy as a matter of 'black and white' in the figurative sense. indeed, at the beginning of the movie, Murrow is portrayed as saying something like: ~i don't believe every story has two sides; and, besides, the other side has had years to present its case.~ i don't believe Murrow (or any other honest journalist, for that matter) believed the former; i don't believe he ever said that; and, even if he did, the makers of this movie (who didn't give 5 seconds to the other side, incidentally) are well aware that, based upon the revelations in the Venona papers and revelations by the successor organization to the old KGB, there certainly were lots and lots of shades of gray to the whole episode.see, for example, the very anti-McCarthy cold war historian Thomas Powers's concession that much of what McCarthy *originally* claimed (ie, that the State Department was shot through with Soviet Spies, the Truman Administration knew this, and that they were dealing with the problem silently, without letting the public know what was really going on) was largely true, contrary to the film putting the words into Murrow's mouth that '99%' of the people McCarthy was accusing were innocent {never mind its slyly trying to make it seem as if Alger Hiss was not proved to have been a spy}.(google searches of 'Venona' on the New York Review of Books, NY Times, Nova, etc will confirm this.)that McCarthy was a nasty drunk and a scoundrel is not in dispute. but, nonetheless, the substance of his original charge is largely true, contrary to this movie's 'black and white' representations.on his Sunday morning talking heads program, Chris Matthews said he had reservations about a film that was so one-sided. but, after seeing it, he realized this film is not about what happened then; rather, it is about what's happening now. that is, about the ways in which dissent is being equated with disloyalty. (for just one example, the very name 'Patriot Act' implies that its opponents are, well, unpatriotic.) but, in a subsequent show, aired the day of the Oscar awards ceremony, Matthews said 'the problem with Goodnight and Good Luck' (as a candidate for Best Picture) is that this movie makes it appear 'as if the other side was making it all up.' (quotes to the best of my recollection.) contrary to the implicit claims of this thoroughly dishonest movie, the other side had no need 'to make it all up'.",9,0,3,30 April 2006
