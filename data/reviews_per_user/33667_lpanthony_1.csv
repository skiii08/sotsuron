Hereditary," The best part of this movie was 1 single death.
","Thats it.
Like a bad XXX movie, you watch 2+hours all for a 15second moneyshot.
Acting is average.
Camera work is average.
Story line is below subzero.
There is no development on any part. Who was the father? What did he do? What was the daughters issues? What really was the problem with everyone?
What was with the ending? I walked away with more questions than a child in Sunday school!!!!
Not worth the trouble or the time.",1,1,3,23 March 2019
