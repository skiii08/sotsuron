Alien 3," Pales in comparison
","' This is rumor control, and these are the facts..' Alien 3 pales in comparison to the previous two films. It seems David Fincher wanted to combine the elements of the first two films to create a dark, foreboding action movie.Something just didn't work. For one thing there isn't anyone in the film to truly like, after all, everyone is a double y chromo and prone to things like murder and rape. Not exactly the cast you get all teary-eyed over when they meet the alien. Only Riply (Sigourney Weaver) remains from the other films, and she is acting a tad strange in this one too. For example: Ripley is asked to remain in sick-bay because the men have not even seen a woman in years. Remember too, that these are men that are all lifers, having no qualms about committing horrid acts. So what does Riply do? She goes to the mess hall to have lunch with them. Ripley was a very smart woman in the other two films, what happened? Too long in cryogenic sleep? At one point Riply tells the inmates 'I've never seen one(the alien) move Quite like this one does.' I guess she hasn't seen too many poor cgi effects before. This is the weakest of the alien series. That is, of course, until they made Alien Resurrection.",6,704,875,31 May 2001
Alien," Dark and Foreboding
","Dark, foreboding, sinister. Ridley Scott has created a world of shadows that conceal a lurking predator within the sealed hull of a space cargo ship. An alien creature who's sole drive is to survive, and that can only be accomplished with the death of the crew of the Nostromo. 'IT, the Terror from Beyond Space' is a forerunner of this film, but Scott has elevated the horror story way beyond those 50's monster flicks(don't get me wrong, I love those old horror films).The tensions build slowly and then reach fever pitch.From a deserted rock of a planet to the dark cooling tunnels of the ship, Scott has created a vision of the future that looks and feels authentic.A landmark film that changed the look of this genre for a long time to come. The cast is perfect, especially Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. She defines the strong woman that can control her destiny instead of succumb to it. A highly recommended film.",10,0,1,28 May 2001
Aliens," Something Rare, a grand sequel
","James Cameron took the continuing story of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in a different direction than the first installment. Where Ridley Scott slowly built tension in the claustrophobic Nostromo, Cameron takes the story back to the desolate planet LV-426 and is relentless in the action that ensures. Ripley, along with a troop of Colonial marines, are not faced with a single alien(which almost killed everyone in the first film), but a hive of them.    The two films marry together quite nicely. The dark foreboding atmosphere of the first and the nonstop battle excitement of the second. Other fine performances are delivered by, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and of course Lance Henriksen as Bishop.This is a rare film:A sequel that is as good as the original.",10,0,1,28 May 2001
Insidious," half and half
","Insidious begins with the Lamberts(Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) moving into a new home that is as haunted as the Belasco house. As all hell breaks loose their son (Ty Simpkins) falls into an unexplainable coma. Ghostly things continue to happen so the family pulls up stakes and moves into another home, but the evil follows them.With the aid of a psychic(Lin Shaye) the Lamberts learn that their son's astral body is trapped in a place called 'The Further'by a lip stick faced demon.There is a s√©ance with a gas mask no less. It's downhill from there.Insidious has a few jump scenes but fails to scare. The confrontation with the demon is a let down as the demon appears as ultimately powerless.The biggest scare was remembering Tiny Tim singing Tip Toe Through the Tulips on Laff-in.",5,0,0,13 July 2011
