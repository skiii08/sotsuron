The Legend of Bagger Vance," 'Golf' would have been a more suitable title
","Matt Damon plays Rannulph Junuh, a golf champion from Savannah, who leaves his gorgeous (isn't she?) girlfriend Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) behind to serve his country in World War 1. When he comes back, he is not the same person as he used to be, playing poker instead of golf and drinking heavily. However, when he is invited to take part in a huge golf tournament in Savannah, he finally agrees, accepting the mysterious Bagger Vance (Will Smith) as his 'caddie'. The second hour of the film, we see Junuh compete with two of the biggest golfers in the game for the $10,000 prize.Calling a film a 'legend' is always pretentious and often out of place, and this dramatic comedy by Robert Redford is no exception. The photography, especially during the golf game, is beautiful and the cast is OK, but the story never really came alive. Some parts of the plots were far too superficial, like the romance between Junuh and Adele and the return of Junuh: when he comes back from the War he is mentally destroyed, but it is never explained why, as if the makers of the film thought that this is already such a horrible cliche that an explanation was unnecessary. Overall, this film never felt like a 'legend'; 'Golf' should have been a better suitable title. But it was entertaining enough to prevent me from rating it lower than 6.6/10",6,3,6,2 May 2001
The Untouchables," Great sets, great music, great actors.. but that's all
","After having paid a lot of tributes to Hitchcocks work, it seems he has done the same with the classic gangster movie. 'The Untouchables', does, unfortunately, consist of a lot of cliches: the old and wise cop (Connery), the ultimate gangster (of course Al Capone, played by DeNiro) and the dull businessman (Smith). The acting is good. But although the acting is good, I didn't like to watch the actors at times, because they were playing rather gangster movie prototypes than human beings that we don't 'know' yet. That wouldn't be too bad if De Palma had been original about the plot, but he hasn't.But, don't get me wrong, this movie is still big fun! On the visual side, this movie is, of course, great, as we are used to see from Brian De Palma. In contribution of that, the movie is blessed with another fine and pulsating score from Ennio Morricone (however, at times too emphatically). Eight stars out of ten for 'The Untouchables'.",Null,0,2,31 August 2000
Jaws," Spielberg at his very best
","I saw this movie for the first time a the age of six. I wish I hadn't, because it spoilt my holidays on the beach...Spielberg seems to be the only director of a JAWS-movie who understands how to make his movie scary. I mean very scary, and not laughable as the sequels are.How did he succeed in that? Because he didn't do any more than show us what we are and have always been afraid of: that there is something in the water that can attack us at any time. And we don't get to know much more than Brody (the chief of police) about the shark, and that's why we can fully identify with him: When Brody is looking in a book about sharks what these animals look like and how they attack, we look with him over his shoulder, as fascinated as he is; When Brody is uncomfortable sitting on the beach (being a guard, knowing there may be a shark around), we are.Spielberg keeps his story simple, but very effective. I couldn't find a single weakness in the entire movie, although I have seen it about 15 times or so. The first part of the movie is a lesson in how to build up tension; the second part is a fascinating 'Duel' (referring to Spielbergs debut, which is about as good as 'Jaws') between the shark and the three men. Although they don't seem to be the perfect trio to fight the shark, I think they are the best to appear in this film. At least, I can't imagine who would have played the roles of Brody, Quint and Hooper better than Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss did. Especially Robert Shaw (my favourite actor) is fantastic: I have never seen a more adorable macho than Quint. What a pity that this great actor died in 1978. I almost forgot to mention the terrifying music: couldn't have been better for 'Jaws', the ultimate horror film and my personal favourite.",10,1,2,3 September 2000
