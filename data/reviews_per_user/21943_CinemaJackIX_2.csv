The Avengers," The Avengers
","My Experience Part When I saw the trailer for The Avengers and was skeptical. I loved 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'The Incredible Hulk', and even tolerated 'Captain America: First Avenger'. This could have easily gone either way because a movie this big had never been done before. I walked into the theater for the midnight premiere with 3D glasses in hand not knowing what to expect. Fast forward to the end. I walked out of the theater flabbergasted wearing a grin from ear to ear. Review THE GOOD: The Avengers certainly earned their name. Joss Whedon was able to do what most cannot. He took very different characters from very different universes and brought them all together for one of the best comic book adaptations my eyes have every had the pleasure of watching. The story was solid and plausible for what Marvel Studios has created. The cinematography was great, especially the 360 shot with all of them in a circle ending with an establishing shot of the group with aliens on the New York skyline. And of course, who can forget the Hulk. He stole the show and the motion capture animation was breathtaking. THE BAD: God bless him, but I was not feeling the Captain America suit. He stuck out like a sore thumb which was a real shame. AND THE UGLY: Movie ticket prices are a bit too high. I wanted to watch this at least 2 or 3 more times after seeing it for a second time.",10,1,4,5 May 2012

","My Experience When I saw the first trailer to Iron Man 3, I was ecstatic. After having seen the disappointing Iron Man 2, I was dead set on this being a redemption movie simply because this was post Avengers. I walked in the theater knowing full well that I will one day own this on Blu Ray Combo Pack and now I don't even want a bootleg of this (never thought I say this) garbage. I'm writing this review because it is getting way too much praise and should not. When it comes to movies (especially comic book adaptations) I have a very high tolerance for fantasy, creativity, and imagination all grounded in reality. But even I have my limits. I got 3/4 of the way through the movie until I just couldn't buy it anymore. It was not getting any better. I could no longer blind myself to the plot holes and that this is a flat out bomb.ReviewGOOD: Iron Man 3 had me in stitches. Hands down the funniest Iron Man yet. Which is way I gave this 2/10 rather than its well deserved 1/10.BAD: Like I said, I was able to get pretty far into the movie until the foundation of reality began to crumble. And once you pass that breaking point. The trolls come out of the woodwork on everything leading to that point. Strike 1: One definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results. Tony Stark now has post traumatic stress sydrome induced by the awesome powerhouse of a movie that was: The Avengers. Which was a very smart route to go.'The Invincible Iron Man' that we know and love has reached a new level in humanity and venerability that we all have and can relate to. This problem was never resolved. In order to get over his memories and hallucinations of battle from The Avengers he goes to fight in another battle. Insanity. Ball 1: It is a Christmas family comedy nothing more. Do not kick off the summer with a Christmas movie. It's sort of an unspoken rule. This is nothing against Christmas. It's remains to this day my favorite holiday and always will when it is appropriate. Strike 2: This is was near breaking point, Sir Ben Kingsley. One of the best actors of our time. The Mandarin destined to be one of the greatest performances in a comic book movie or movies in general since Heath Ledger's Joker. The role was abruptly dismantled and castrated into nothing more than: Trevor. An actor with a drug and alcohol dependency. A front for the real Mandarin Guy Pearce's character. Bad twist. UGLY: Ball 2: There was an overuse of CGI especially when Rhodes was swinging while holding on the trailer. It reminded me of the biggest abomination to ever grace human presence that is: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Strike 3: This is the last and biggest strike for me. All valid points made were permissible until this point. Pepper Potts at the beginning of the movie finally put on the Iron Man suit which was awesome. Naturally, she had no knowledge of using it and struggled operating it. Fast forward to the end of the movie if you will. She seemed to have full knowledge of the Iron Man hand blaster along with knowledge of hand to hand combat. She takes out the archenemy of Iron Man: The Mandarin. In Spiderman (2002), did Peter Parker let Mary Jane take out The Green Goblin? Did Bruce Wayne let Vicki Vale (Batman 1989) or Rachel Dawes (The Dark Knight 2008) take out the Joker. The Mandarin is the archenemy of Iron Man. I have no problem with female leads taking out villains. For example, Catwoman took out Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and I loved it, but there is a reason why we call them archenemies. They challenge the physical and mental essence of the protagonist. Which Guy Pearce's character did and all Stark did was slap him around a bit and then let his girlfriend finish him. It seems Marvel Studios' Phase 2 isn't off to a good start.",2,5,11,5 May 2013
