The New World," The New World, could be better with more action, less montages
","The New World, could be better with more action, less montages. I would just start to get interested in the plot of The New World then a montage of music, film and an actor narrating. The montages would put me to sleep. Cut them out and leave the plot and action, would be a wonderful movie. The pace of the movie was interrupted by the narrative montages, which got to be boring. Made it hard to care about the characters or understand them. The montages didn't add anything to the storyline. They didn't show anything, nothing was gained by them. Hard to understand the young boys and some of the men at the fort. Not all of the natives words were translated onto subtitles.",3,1,4,11 May 2006
