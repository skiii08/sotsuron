Ford v Ferrari," Ford v Ferrari hits u with full speed and is miles ahead of most films this year
","Must see racing movie. James Mangold brillant film making , amazing character performances from Bale and Damon ( Bale in particular, becomes Ken Miles, he is Ken Miles, it's astonishing how he does that every movie) , nerve wracking racing sequences , terrific sound track - sound editing & mixing...make this a wonderful movie about racing...and surprisingly what's more is the heft of human drama that actually hits u hard more than the racing itself....Mangold has made the impossible, making a racing movie that will be cherished by motorheads and loved by the regular movie lovers as well...Iam giving it 10 .",10,1,2,26 January 2020
Train to Busan," A Zombie movie like no other.....
","Train to busan looks the usual zombie flick...with a normal zombie movie plot line...where it scores is it makes us feel for the characters within no time...Director keeps us guessing until the final minute of the film..which is no easy feat...Underlying social commentary in the film adds to the story...zombies are not the scariest things in this movie...humans are more scarier basing on the decisions they make...It has gripping screenplay...and all the usual zombie flick stuff like... near misses, blood and gore, stupid decisions characters take( i hate it when they do that)....What is different is..zombies are super fast...(like world war z) No mention about the incident which made zombies( for a change, i liked it)Above all its a film about a father and his daughter...A zombie film with a surprising emotional connect....Must watch....its not what you expect..itz better..",9,1,4,18 March 2017
Looper," Our choices decide our past, present and future
","The perfect time travel movie made....not an easy thing to accomplish...but Rian Johnson does it and it looks so good....powerful storytelling, stylish good old action and the visuals reminding of 'Children of Men' is what makes this futuristic sci-fi , an excellent movie........and the HEART this movie has...makes it a GREAT movie.... Do watch it...you will be surprised....",9,1,2,2 March 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Riveting war movie
","Beautiful and brutal....Savage and tender.....the best war scenes filmed since 'Saving Private Ryan'...Mel Gibson makes an engaging character study...and a stirring anti-war movie.... Based on a true story...which was nothing short of a miracle actually...the film shows...the casualties of war quite beautifully...and reminds us to stand by our beliefs no matter what....and that's what a world at war needs, men of belief.",8,7,11,2 March 2017
