Black Swan," Enter into Darkness of Swan Lake
","This movie, 'Black Swan' is deep and thought provoking into a world of the hard and unknown - darkness. Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a young and upcoming ballerina that has danced four years for her dance company. She has followed in the footsteps of her mother in search for the perfect star role as a ballerina. Set in New York City, she engorges into dance with no other interests to life with her mother as a primary advocate and supporter. A suspenseful thriller along with drama, it leaves you on the edge of your seat as you await the next. Tomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) plays as the director of this dance company with the main focus of finding the next Swan Queen for their new and upcoming season of 'Swan Lake.' He challenges Nina all the while, breaking her free from the perfection that she so long desires, setting barriers to break if the final outcome is desired. The dancers become more challenged to strive for the star role as scenes are played out. The road takes Nina to places of darkness in a fast paced world that she is not accustomed to. Erica, Nina's mother that is played by Barbara Hershey, sets the stage of a young innocent young lady, primed and propped for the world of ballet as she horns deep feelings of her own life as a young ballerina. When Beth, the 'princess,' who is played by Winona Ryder, is replaced by Nina, her life becomes a whirlwind of changes; this leads Nina to the performance where she must be the white, innocent and graceful and the black, dark and near evil, swan in one. Lily (Mila Kunis) is the sole dancer who appears to be challenging Nina into this long awaited role of the Swan Queen. Invigorating and captive, these young dancers become rivals and more than less, Nina lives on the edge of danger as she becomes in touch with her dark side.",8,0,1,1 May 2011
