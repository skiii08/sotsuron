Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Miraculously, It's Better Than People Say
","'The Phantom Menace' is actually a good movie - with flaws. Most of my complaints stem from the fact that this movie works way better in theaters AND when I was younger.Having observed this movie many years later, there's a lot of savory things along with some bad. First, the bad.Jar Jar's character was OK, to be honest, with the exception of one scene: THE CLIMAX! Seriously, it might work for kids, but when you're building up to a grand slam end, it only weakens it to have some goofball hopping in between droids trying to play ball-tossing. Diagnosis: some misplaced comic relief. Another weak point wasn't so much the acting - but rather the wasted moments where tension could be kept better. 'Oh, we're being shot at. Shields up at maximum.' Most of the bad acting was really the boring security guards trying to talk politics most of the time. Also, and I'll probably be the only one to say this: Natalie Portman was a little too wooden to make me believe her homeworld is in danger. Lastly, and this is the biggest problem - the Sith. We know the Sith are evil. We know the sith are enemies to the jedi. BUT WHO ARE THE SITH!? The film never really explains, and even keeps Darth Maul in the shadows most of the time the movie runs. With a proper explanation, the film could've felt more like 'The Beginning' instead of 'Starting a certain point-in-time in the Star Wars Universe'.NOW! The good . . . we're introduced into a whole different world from the original trilogy, and each new scenic place IS inspired, just as well as the originals worked for their days. The visuals were astounding, though on the little screen aren't nearly as impressive. Characters are INTRODUCED in part one, and are DEVELOPED in part two. I think the characters were introduced pretty well. The only problem with this is that the characters are just . . . there. There's no swaggering Han Solo, no underestimated Luke . . . just an obedient Obi-One, a politically motivated Queen Amidala, and a Jedi Qui-gon.Overall, it IS good, and I think the reason most people were disappointed with it was because they had in mind certain little things that made it obvious Anakin turns into Darth Vader - in the movie, Anakin is an innocent little boy, not someone who will obviously become evil, for example.I recommend it.",7,9,12,17 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Still Better Than People Will Say
","'Attack of the Clones' has good and bad, and, traditionally, we'll start with the bad.The worst complaint I have is that george Lucas abandoned the 'innocent boy' tagline and had Anakin in love with Padme BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO KNOW WHO HE IS NOW! In his first scene (in an elevator), he's getting pimped up to Padme! This forced love affair naturally taints the rest of the movie with horrible lovelines, 'Sand gets everywhere,' and overall, a horribly done lovestory. Had Anakin developed an interest during the movie instead before it even begins, the story could've had some stronger points. Plus, no offense George, but I tried using the 'You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams' line and got slapped for it. The other bad thing was the acting - particularly the boring tone Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have concerning things. Uh, hello? At least TRY to look concerned? Plus, once on the small screen, the visuals aren't that great.Now . . . magicially, this film DOES get its audience comfortable with the evironment, and while people criticize this movie as having long, boring scenes, I think the scenes prolong the audience to get involved in the adventure (even if it hasn't really started yet). In short, it develops the story almost perfectly. In fact, very well. Simply put, this isn't the main point of the prequel trilogy. Knowing that, this is part II, the DEVELOPING part. Episode III is (in this case) the EXECUTION, where the author says, 'This is what the story is about.'Episode II stumbles a lot, but, along with great visuals throughout, it gets its audience comfortable with the evironment.",Null,1,1,17 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Best Movie in the Series
","'Revenge of the Sith' is the EXECUTION part of the trilogy, where everything is developd and now, we are to see how everything transpired into, sadly, the darkest chapter in the series - the rise of the Empire, the end of the Jedi Council, and the rise of Darth Vader.First the bad. Okay.Now for the good. While I still think Natalie Portman needs improvement, I knew instinctly that her role in this would be only to have two children and die. Anakin, (Hayden C.), although definitely not the greatest actor in this, is by far better than the whining in Episode II. Plus, the visuals did something for me that the previous two had not done - set the tone.The very first prolonged shot set the tone for me, immedtaiely making the audience aware of how screwed things are in the story. (Don't worry, if you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it). The movie runs really fast until about the middle of the movie, when things start going wrong.The downfall of Darth Vader is tricky. Many people say it was forced, but I don't think so. Honestly, even after the horrible love story we laughed at in Episode II, Anakin's love for Padme is ultimately his undoing. His desire to control things is used by the Emperor through reverse psychology - which brings me to another highlight.Ian McDiarmid outdid everyonr in this just about. His snaky way of dropping seeds into Anakin were expertly done. And we finally get to see a sith at his evil best.The drama did it for me. Sad as this will sound to everyone, this movie made me cry at least five times. Seeing how that innocent little boy became the monster he becomes is extremely moving.PG-13 makes this really good. PG-13 for intense warfare violence, a graphic scene that explains why he goes into the Vader outfit, and . . . a cutaway scene that says 'This man is butchering little kids'.In short, the story is delivered without missing many beats. The long six-year payoff works, and hands off to Lucas for surprisingly making me cry like a little girl.",10,0,3,17 August 2006
