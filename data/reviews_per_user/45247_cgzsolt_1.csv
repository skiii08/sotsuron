The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A great political thriller
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is the 3rd installment to the very popular 'Hunger Games' Series. Going into this movie you must know, There are no games, There isn't a lot of action but there is killer suspense, and great acting by Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. The film begins where Catching fire left off, in the opening scenes I thought I was watching a Horror movie, It WAS that dark. In District 13, Katniss Everdeen is very emotionally unstable as she learns that her hometown District 12 is destroyed and no longer exists. District 13 Leader President Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) Try to convince Katniss to become the symbol for the long brewing revolution, but Katniss Isn't down with that, not until Coin agrees to rescue Peeta and the other tributes.This film is very dark and emotional, scene after scene there are people being executed, shot to death or blown up. But there's also a great action sequence in the movie that features 'The Hanging Tree' sung by Jennifer Lawrence, Which she did a great job of.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a great political thriller, it is mostly a media war consisting of Propaganda video vs Capitol Propaganda video. Towards the end of the film it gets very intense and suspenseful, the ending scenes reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty, so if you enjoy extremely emotional films and War. This is one you want to watch.But if you're expecting tons of action sequences, maybe waiting for Part 2 is something you should consider. I think people have confused themselves into thinking Part 1 will be full of action, it isn't, but It's very good and stays true to the book, in fact the most faithful book to movie adaptation I've ever seen.That's why I give The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 | 8/10 Stars, Roll on Part 2.",10,17,49,21 November 2014
