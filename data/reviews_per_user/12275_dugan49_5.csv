Saturday Night Fever," You should be dancing
","The rap on SNF today is that it is dated. The music, the dance moves, the clothes, and this supposedly detracts from the film. Personally I don't get this, every film that is about a specific place and time ends up 'dated'. Some even start out that way. If a movie was made today in 2012, about the disco scene from the mid 70's, wouldn't they use similar music, dance moves and fashions as SNF does? The 'dated' complaint is senseless, in my opinion.Saturday Night Fever begins with a lot of visceral energy as we learn about Tony Manero and his obsession with disco dancing and hanging with his lower class Italian crew. There is a vibrancy to the film that jumps off the screen. As the thin plot unwinds, some of the energy unwinds with it. There is a raw appeal to the street milieu that carries us through some of the more pedestrian scenes and conversations, but as expected, it is when the music is playing and the feet are moving that Saturday Night Fever comes alive.",8,1,2,4 February 2012
We Were Soldiers," In the Upper Level Of Modern War Movies
","Not as good as Saving Private Ryan or Blackhawk Down, but better than most other war movies of the past 25 years, We Were Soldiers is a no nonsense retelling of the first large scale engagement in Viet Nam between American troops and North Vietnamese regulars, in 1965. Mel Gibson stars as Colonel Hal Moore, who leads the famed U.S. 7th Cavalry , now air mobile, into a 'test' battle in the central highlands of Nam to judge the effectiveness of new combat tactics derived through use of helicopter transport of troops directly into a hostile ( hot lz) landing zone. Immediately upon landing, Moore's battalion is attacked by hundreds of NVA, regular soldiers of North Viet Nam who are based in the nearby hills. The attacking force soon balloons to thousands, and the Americans are outnumbered and surrounded. The movie then very diligently and dutifully portrays the hectic and brutal three day battle.The best thing about this movie is it's point of view, which shows the regard a commander has for his troops and his dedication to his duty and mission. Gibson is outstanding in portraying a decent yet disciplined leader who must maintain control and cohesion in the midst of chaos and incredible violence. Sam Elliot also stands out as the unit's Sergeant major, an old timer made of guts and granite.It's not a perfect movie and the violence , while overwhelming at times, is not as well done as in the two films I mentioned at the top. Still it has it's moments. A lot of them as a matter of fact. The main pleasure I took from this film was in watching military men of honor do their thing on a field of battle while I was sitting in a comfortable chair in a safe place.",8,0,2,20 September 2011
Duck Soup," Funniest 15 Minutes In Movie History
","The last 15 minutes of Duck Soup, inside Groucho's command headquarters during the war with Sylvania, are the funniest 15 minutes in film history. Non stop verbal, physical and visual gags, puns and insults, and almost all of them hit the mark , and play well 80 years later.Aide to Groucho, who is shooting out the window - ' But sir, you are shooting your own men.Groucho hands the aide a bill - 'here's five dollars , keep it under your hat.'Grouch takes the five dollars back and says 'better yet, I'll keep it under my hat.'Duck Soup is the best Marx Brothers film because it is the most cynical and anarchic of them all. Some of the jokes are dated beyond help, and make cultural references that today's generation simply will not understand or appreciate, but those last 15 minutes are enough in itself to make this one of the all time great comedies.",10,1,2,4 February 2012
Parasite," deserving of accolades
","Parasite has it all. Direction, acting , screenplay and camerawork are all award level.This film is not boring, and the first hour is about as fascinating and attention grabbing as a movie can be. The second hour is not quite as successful as the first, in my opinion, but is still high level entertainment.The key to Parasite is the script, which is tasked with leading the viewer through a myriad of pinpoint plot developments that always seem to be teetering on a razors edge. I feel safe to say this is one of the best screenplays of the 21st century.If I had to summarize Parasite it would be , 'never a dull moment'.",Null,0,0,19 April 2020
Unbroken," First half superb - last half not
","Unbroken opens with an extended sequence of a bombing run by a US B-17 crew against Japanese targets in the Pacific, and the subsequent attack on the bomber by a squad of Japanese Zero fighters. This aerial combat sequence is one of the most harrowing of it's kind I have ever seen. You actually feel like you are in that plane experiencing that terror and exhilaration first hand. This segment cannot be over praised, it is that good. Another sequence in a bomber, where the plane experiences massive engine failure and crashes into the sea with the crew all on board is also very well done. The flashback segments on Zamperini's running career are also fine, the extended sequence depicting three airmen's time on a life raft floating in the middle of the Pacific ocean is well done. So far it's all good. Then we get to the meat of the film, the prisoner of war scenes, and the film becomes a ponderous slog through torture and brutal beatings of the main character by an effeminate and sadistic Japanese captor. This is essentially the entire second half of the film, and it becomes monotonous and numbing. The photography, sound , and music in this film were all award-caliber, and Jolie shows great promise as a mainstream director.",7,6,10,7 April 2015
