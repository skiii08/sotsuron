Angels & Demons," Ron Howard's Angels & Demons
","First you should know this is not Dan Brown book. This is Ron Howard's Angels & Demons. A different story line with his biases added. Ron Howard direction and Tom Hanks performance was equal to Da Vinci Code. The movie has good action, great sound effects and a lot of eye candy. The 140 minutes went by fast. Like most sequels the uniqueness of the first movie is all ready out of the hat. The uniqueness is lost the second time around. Do not go to the movie thinking this will be the best movie ever, it is not. If you go thinking this will be fun, you will be right. I give this movie 9 out of 10. . I am a fan of Ron Howard and Tom Hanks movies and wish if they have to state their political views that they would give both sides of the issue. What does the stem cell issue have to do with the story line any way? Religion is part of the story line and I think Mr. Howard was fair with that issue. Man can and dose miss up religion not Jesus.",9,2,3,22 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," No salvation for the Terminator
","I am sad to say Director McG destroyed this franchise. His casting was terrible. Christian Bale is a great edgy character actor. He could not sell the audience he is the kind hearted John Connor. Bale should have been the Terminator. Sam Worthington would have been a better choice as John Connor. McG story telling at best was confusing. The story was all over the place with weak dialog. The visual effects looked great but they did not help tell the story. They actually made it more confusing because most of the time they had no purpose. His many battle scenes went on so long that they became boring. McG put in a lot of nonsense. Example, Connor has a piece of iron the size of a 2x4 plunged in to his chest that protrudes out his back. The next scene he is on the operating table looking like he was there for a yearly check up and the doctor say I think he has a bad heart. The movie is bad, boring, ridiculous and a big disappointment. Not even a good rental.",2,7,13,22 May 2009
The Soloist," The Soloist a good time not to see it
","When you pick a movie I hope one factor you will consider, are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society. When a comedian/actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves (do I want to support that behavior)? In this case Mr. Foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong, good behavior from bad that loving-kindness is better than hatefulness. Mr. Foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from. Saying sorry does not get him off the hook. It will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. No longer see anything they are part of. We cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them.",1,5,21,22 May 2009
