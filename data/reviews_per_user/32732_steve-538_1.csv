The Blair Witch Project," I AM BEGGING YOU STOP ALL THE HOOPLA ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!
","Ok, so I saw the movie, finally. Ok, I see what the critics say about it. It's unusual, right, Oh, how great: black and white, made by two amatures, great, looks so real, the movie is developed, filmed in the woods, cinema verete-shmerite.. ok, ok, ok. Please.... The movie sucks, boring, no plot, and for my $9.50,  at least show me a glimpse of the Blair Witch !I know just what happened, the two directors/geeks came up with the idea of putting 3 kids in the woods. But they did not have a script written. It's ok, they said. Let's try it. Half-way through the movie they realize that they don't know how proceed or how to end the damn movie. And they tried, and they tried, and they tried.They experiment with putting a pile of crap in front of the kids sleeping bags. Suspensful.. OOOOH, stop it! They started making noises at night Eerie...Oh, Please, Horrid! so.. But what do you do next?. .. OK. I've said enough, I want my money back. The movie is half-done...Boys get a real camera. This movie belongs in  Anzhelika movie theater. They are very lucky, that this summer did not have so many hits! the king is naked!",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
