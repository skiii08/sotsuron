Scarface," What A Great Bad Movie
",A truly deplorable over the top mindless gangster movie but I love it ! Pacino plays one of the lowest low life despicable gangsters ever and most of the other characters are not much better only Montana's mother has any morale quality as everyone in this film is mired in the muck. The vulgar language and violent carnage is wonderful and somehow works in this never boring classic. Many other films of this type I find distasteful and offensive but for reasons I can't explain this one I never tire of seeing. The drug deal gone bad early in the film is masterfully done and the climactic shoot out with Montana and his former drug partners hitmen standout along with the always brilliant Pacino.,9,0,0,7 January 1999
Gettysburg," Good film slightly flawed by Turner TV style production
","When I saw Gettysburg the weekend it opened I think around summer of 1983 I was somewhat disappointed but considering the rarity of historical epics ' my favorite film genre ' and the quality or lack of 80's & 90's films it was a refreshing change of pace and a decent film. Gettysburg was also a subject I had been waiting a lifetime to be put on film having been a Civil War buff. I was disappointed even prior to seeing the film with the knowledge Ted Turner was involved with the production. I expected and was correct in my assumptions that it would be similar to many of the TNT made for TV productions in style and pace, have some political correctness and be mild in the area of blood and graphic violence all of which were detrimental to the film. On the first point I thought the direction was lackluster and the battles did not have the intensity of the much more moving and exciting Glory.  Concerning PC I thought the speech by Jeff Daniels as Chamberlain was moving and one of the best scenes in the film however his sergeants comments about blacks was out of place and a little too much for 1863 !  I don't think its always necessary to have blood & guts all over the screen as in most current films depicting violence but I do believe that if ever graphic violence was necessary to convey a historical event it was needed most notably during Pickett's charge in which bodies were ripped to shreds by the massive fire that was inflicted upon them and was part of the great tragedy and horror of the Civil War.  I would have also liked the film to be in a wide screen format but again I think this has to do with Turner and TV. I liked all of the performances of the small star cast in the film even Martin Sheen as Lee ' I'm not sure why his performance was criticized so much ' my favorites were Jeff Daniels and Tom Berenger  with the only exception being Sam Elliott a perennial TNT movie star who was annoying with his over-acting.  On the plus side was the very fine score and for a 4+ hour film it flew by and had many moving scenes one of them was the rousing cheer of Lee's men as he came to greet them prior to the climactic battle and two great scenes involving Chamberlain ' his speech early on and leading his ammunition depleted men on a desperate bayonet charge' . I also have to admit I watch this film every time its on Turner and my appreciation grows for it with every viewing and the shortcomings I mentioned bothered me initially but not in my repeated viewing and considering the extreme rarity of Civil War epics I now would highly recommend seeing Gettysburg.",7,2,2,14 January 1999
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," No Sundance we didn't put enough dynamite in there !?
",I'm sure we all have one film that we see and ask the question ' what is all the fuss about  !? ' for me BCATSK is that film. It's far beyond my comprehension how this film was so popular with filmgoers and critics. Although I think critics jumped on the band wagon over time in part due to its popularity as I think it was coolly received when initially released . Whatever the case may be its my personal candidate for most over rated film ever !  To start with I didn't find any of its lame dialogue witty or funny. I specially hated the initial scene with Redford and Ross ' keep going teacher lady and Why can't you ever be on time ' also the closing lines between Redford & Newman were also unfunny and corny. My recollection of the trailers for the film gave me the impression this was an action film and I consider it to be a contemporary of films of its time Bonnie & Clyde and The Wild Bunch. Those were truly great films while BCATSD was a pale imitation. The few action scenes in the film were too lightweight and the only memorable moment in the film for me was when Butch & Sundance kill  bandits during a period where they try to go straight and Sundance comments ' well we've gone straight ' When the film tried to get serious and hard edged the producers bailed out badly at the end. Our Hollywood pretty boys  were freeze framed at the conclusion instead of being graphically shot to pieces as was the norm for the time and had they the courage to film it that way it would have given the film some power. I'm sure they would tell you that it was not the intention of the film to go in that direction but this was to be a fun light film. Light yes fun perhaps to those amused by the dialogue but nothing else. I'm sure the Newman Redford combo and chemistry had more to do with the film's success than anything else. It was nicely photographed and had a good score but what is this movie about and what is it saying to us !? The Pinkerton pursuit was overlong and I think in part due to the lack of any real script. I got the impression they wrote it as they went along. I don't think BCATSK was a bad film just a mediocre one that just happened to become an all time classic.,5,11,19,14 December 1998
Independence Day," mindless junk
","When I saw the early trailers for ID the first thing that came to mind was ' War Of The Words ' which is one of my favorite SCI-FI films. I was unfortunately suckered into seeing this over-commercialized over- hyped pile of mindless junk. Forgetting that this is the 90's and during the summer special effects and action are all that's required to draw people to the theaters. A plausible well written story with good drama, tension and excitement are not necessary for the brain dead of our society who continue to throw away money on this junk every year which means we will continue to see more garbage like it every year. This film is not that bad and I wouldn't detest it so much if it didn't earn so much money. I keep hoping people will tire of these films and spend their money on something better or will never see the end of junk like this. The first half is not too bad and the image of the huge spaceships that cover entire cities is quite scary and does have dramatic impact. Once we get to the underground secret lab and the hidden space ship the film goes down hill faster than you can say ID !? The clichés pile up starting with the millionth time since Watergate on film that our Gov. is keeping secrets from the people even the Pres., then of course we have to have at least 1 gooey slimy gory alien surgery scene and as far as the special effects I saw nothing in this film new or impressive that we haven't seen since Star Wars which is now over 20 years old. Then we're expected to believe that as advanced as this allien invader is their technology has not improved in the last 40+ years that they wouldn't detect one of their old spaceships is manned by man and infiltrating their brain center and that we could learn to fly it in a very short time or that it would still even fly !? It's too bad the producers couldn't find some creative writers to find a more scientific or imaginative way to destroy the invaders. I'll take War Of The Worlds, When Worlds Collide and  Colossus The Forbin Project 3 far more entertaining end of the world dramas and watch them over and over again rather than every sitting through ID which should stand for Idiots Donate !",3,6,10,22 February 1999
The Dirty Dozen," The Best Ensemble Rugged He-Man Cast Ever !!!!!!
","Time and Turner saturating the airways about once a month have taken some toll on the impact of this great action adventure film which has the best ensemble rugged he-man cast every to take on the Nazi's on film. Tame by today's standards it was landmark in 1967 for unlike any previous war film the objective was not to take an island or a hill or a fortress but to kill enemy officers. Released during a time when we still considered war to have some morale standards at least when conducted by American's what better way to justify murdering our enemy than using the dregs of the American Army in a top secret covert mission.  Our heroes a mixture of murderers thieves and rapists were actually more villainous than their Nazi adversaries  The dozen's casting was highlighted by the brilliant Cassavetes as the punk gangster Franco and Savalas as the sadistic psychotic bigot Maggott. Bronson, Brown &  Walker are the brawn of the group and the film provides all of them the opportunity to display their physical attributes. Sutherland represents the only other major character of the dozen as the unit idiot. Lee Marvin was in his prime and I consider this his best and most definitive role as the leader of the dozen. Borgnine and Ryan also standout as adversarial superiors to Marvin. This was a man's film from beginning to end and although not as colorful or explicit as the excellent book it was based on it was every bit as good a film as was the book and the exciting climax was a big improvement on the non climactic book.",10,21,33,7 January 1999
Saving Private Ryan," It's only a war movie
","I'm waiting for the second run of SPR so I can see it for a third time. This is not to say I loved this film or consider it to be the great masterpiece so many have over-hyped it to be. I happen to love historical epics and WWII is my favorite history subject along with the rarity of this type film these days makes it the more desirable for me to view. I do concur with all the rave about the opening beach landing being an intense awe-inspiring film experience however the remaining two plus hours of the film are quite ordinary and only the exciting battle at the conclusion of the film rescues SPR from being a dull disappointment. I also find the battle at the end of the film to be a contradiction to the opening battle and confuses the whole message.  In the first battle we are in the middle of massive carnage and gore and get the feel of being pinned down and what it's like to fear moving an inch and being killed but if you don't move you will be killed anyway! There is no false heroics only desperate men trying to stay alive and do their job. This better than any battle I've seen on film convinces me that I don't want any part of combat and there is nothing glorious about it and those that endured through it deserve our greatest admiration and respect which I believe is the primary message in the film.  The conclusion however resembles the rousing old adventure war films of the past.  Capt. Miller has found Ryan and has orders to bring him back to be sent home and this is his mission but instead he is talked into defending an important bridge by Ryan who doesn't want to abandon his comrades. We are then treated to an exhilarating battle that does not nearly match the terror and gore of the first and all the old W.W.II movie clichÃ©s start to show up. The rock hard sergeant who feels no pain no matter how many times he is shot, Ryan and his honorable loyalty to his men refusing to go home without having to risk his life any longer and of course the cavalry saving the day at the end when all appears lost !? I have a problem with films today dealing with war in that they go out of there way to try and convey too many messages as I believe there is a fear that its no longer politically correct or acceptable to make a war film for the sake of entertainment.  I do believe there have been some great war films with a message such as Paths Of Glory and Go Tell The Spartans and others but there have been far too many that try too hard to preach war is hell and so on and SPR is one of them. I'm not ashamed to say that I prefer films like The Longest Day and Where Eagles dare as they are more entertaining and far more successful at what they are trying to be. No film today tomorrow or a hundred years from now will ever convey the horror of war or will impact society's view of war alone.  Twenty years from now some other war film will come along and SPR will seem tame in comparison but it will still just be a movie like SPR is.   I went to see SPR for the action and my W.W.II interest and was compelled only by those two things not the weak story line or pretentious messages and syrupy drama. SPR is a good film because of two great action pieces that hold up the long message laden middle and if it wasn't for the cliched conclusion and Ryan simply returned to the rear this film would not be seen by as many people who would have been disappointed by a anti-climactic non action conclusion which is the primary reason people view war films to see combat action not be preached at about how horrible war is !",7,0,0,25 January 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," You are the ONE !? NOT !!
",I don't want to hear about how deep or profound this boring overblown mess is. The fights are tiresome and the philosophy even more tiresome. What was fresh exciting and dazzling the first time around is dark drab and exhausting to sit through.  There is one very impressive action piece near the end but its not enough for me.,4,0,0,2 June 2003
