Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," terrible
","This film seems more like it's out to make money rather then to renew the magic of star wars. I mean, lets face it, if u put the name star wars on anything it is going to make money. This trash proves it. terribly over hyped, teribly acted, not exciting, not magical like the originals, and jsut plain downright awful. and lemme tell you something, i had a head ache the next week from this movie due to jar jar binks talking. had they killed him off it might have been enough to make this a mediocre movie. 1/10 stars",Null,0,1,18 June 2002
Minority Report," absolulty astonishing
","this movie completely blew me away. easily one of if not the best movie of 2002. how often does a movie come along that has amazing special effects, story, acting, and a great plot twits ( or twists). i would recomend this movie to anyone. if u haven't seen it u definetly should. u will not be disappointed. 10/10",9,0,0,31 July 2002
Fight Club," one of my favotries
","this movie is one of the greatest movies ever made. now i know those are some pretty strong words, but in my opinion this movie ranks right up there with the godfather and citizen kane.the acting was superb, the story was amazing, the plot twists were incredible and really just the overall theme of the movie is an amazing concept that astounds me. lost souls looking to find a way out, this flim shows what american society can do to an average person. i just can't say enough about this movie and how it amazed me. this is also proof of how bradd pitt is one of the greatest actors out there and is overdue for an oscar 10/10 stars",10,0,1,18 June 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," By Far the best Pirate movie ever!!
","I recently went to the theatre to catch the new flick Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the black pearl. From seeing the previews i expected this to be a great movie and let me tell you it was! This movie was adventurous, mysterious, genuine and funny! Johnny Depp was great as captain jack sparrow and he had me laughing numerous times throughout the movie. the storyline was great, the acting was great and the movie was very exciting! i would recommened this movie to anyone and everyone! The speacial effects were awesome! The movie was Great and exciting without being corny or boring, it was an edge of the seat thriller at times, a funny comedy and times and even a romantic love story at times. I loved this movie and i think everyone should watch it! Id give it a 10 out of 10!",10,0,1,13 July 2003
Spider-Man," best super hero film
","I went to see this film about a week ago thinking it was gonna be terrible. usually these moneymaking hyped up films are pretty bad( phantom menace, titanic) however i have to admit i was pretty entertained. The special effects were breathtaking, sometimes i actually felt like i was saoring new york city right behind spiderman. the action was great, the acting was great too. Some people have told me they thought toby maguire was terrible as peter parker. this is absurded, maguire did just what he had to do and brought emotion and life into parker. Something that keaton, kilmer, and clooney failed to do with wayne.dafoe was excellent as the green goblin. i liked him in this role and was glad to see him execute it with such devilish charm. the only downfall of this movie is the green goblin costume. It looked like a power ranger. I think more imagination could have gone into that. besides that this movie lived up to the hype and i went away from it realizing why it made so much money. Few films fail to accomplish this. I would recomend this film to anyone.   10/10stars",10,0,0,18 June 2002
Saving Private Ryan," the greatest war movie ever
","after seeing this flim,my perspective on what war is was changed forever. instead of heroics, and valiant speeches, i saw madness, chaos, and death. it showed how war can not only kill and man, but destory them mentally. the great sacrifice that was made by ww2 vetrans had finally become clear to me. instead of feeling like i could blow up anything like i do at the end of most war films, i felt like i never want to go through the hell that those brave men had to go through. god bless america 10/10stars",10,0,1,18 June 2002
Titanic," the most over rated repulsive peice of garbage i have ever slayed my eyes on
","first of all i cannot belive this movie made the most money ever?!?! how could it. the love story was nothing new, or great. u want a good love story go watch casablanca. hell,saving privet ryan was a better love story then this. there is absolutly nothing great about the story or the way it was told. however i will give the movie some credit. the actual sinking of the boat is very historically accurate. the speacial effects are amazing.however the sappy, unoriginal, corney love story abourd the boat, and the acting, and cast, and music completely sucked. no imagination or geniuse flimaking or storytelling went into this film. i am getting mad jsut typing this. mostly because this atrocity is the highest grossing flim ever. HOW?!?!?!? u new the boat was gonna sink. the love story was not anyhting new. the only reason this made so much money was because geeky teenage girls who have nothing better to do and wouldn't know a real movie if it slapped them in the face went to see it about 90000000 times each. i girl i know personally saw it about 9 times herself.why?!??!!? there is nothing great about this movie i'm sorry and the fact that it made this much money just boils me -100?10 stars. i wouldn't recomend this flim to my worst enemy and i wouldn't go see it again if u payed me what titanic made at the box office",Null,2,3,20 August 2002
A Beautiful Mind," a beautiful movie, not beautifuly rewarded though
","This move was absolutly fantastic. the acting the music and the directin all led to this movie winnig  the best picture oscar, and rightfully so.HOwever, the only problem i have with a beatiful mind at the oscars is russell crowe. HIs portrayl of john nash was absolulty fantastic. how he did not win the oscar is beyond me. not only was russell's acting job superior to denzels, his role was much more difficultto play. now, i'm not taking anything away from denzelsacting, i think he is a fine actor and is deserving of an oscar. HOwever, this year i believe the best performance was russell's with a beautiful mind. besids that this movi was great and ifu have't seen it u should.  10/10 stars",Null,0,1,27 June 2002
Identity," very good thriller, worth the price of admission
","this was a very exciting thriller. I like movies like this that are exciting and keep you guessing till the end, with out turning into a corny free for all. I would recomend this movie to anyone. Right now, i'd say it is the best thriller out right now. GO see it.",9,0,0,3 May 2003
