The Blair Witch Project," Hitchcock would approve of this.
","The Blair Witch Project is an excellent movie in the spirit of any of Alfred Hitchcock's classics.  The psychological terror is immense, and it builds to a great climax.  Anyone that tells you that this movie was bad has no imagination and can't appreciate a film that makes the person think.  Too bad for them.  Excellent movie.",8,0,1,25 July 2000
Sucker Punch," What's the point?
","Sucker Punch takes place all within the mind of a woman sent to a mental ward. In fact, the sequences in the film are a fantasy within a fantasy in the mind of Emily Browning, called Babydoll in the movie. It's like Inception, only sucky. Joining her within her fantasy world are Abbie Cornish (Sweat Pea), Jena Malone (Rocket), Vanessa Hudgens (Blondie â€“ a weird choice given that she's nowhere near blonde), and Jamie Chung (Amber). The second layer fantasies are the more interesting ones, with the girls fighting giant evil samurai, steampunk Nazi soldiers, slaying a dragon, and much more. Unfortunately, despite all of the visual goodies (and the film is shot beautifully with some really cool effects), the film just lacks any sort of coherency or sense for its plot.I think the title of the movie refers to how the audience feels after wasting nearly 2 hours of their lives watching this movie, they got sucker punched. An alternative title would be Zack Snyder's Ultimate Fanservice Extravaganza. Dressing up his female stars in schoolgirl outfits right out of Sailor Moon, and having them fight in all sorts of different fantasy settings, feels like something out of a manga universe. He tries to make a film for the fanboys to drool over, but the only drool that emerged from my mouth was when I nearly fell asleep. I usually like Snyder's films also, both 300 and Watchmen, but this one just bothered me for reasons I can't quite pin down. Probably because I was just laughing throughout the film at the absurdity and pointlessness of everything taking place on screen. Don't waste your time on this one.",4,1,4,1 September 2011
The Mummy Returns," Great Summer Popcorn Movie
","The Mummy Returns is a great sequel to the entertaining Mummy.  The action is fast and furious, and pretty much non-stop.  The fight scenes are excellent, and well coordinated.  The Mummy Returns has great action, beautiful special effects, and it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.  This is not a movie you could easily fall asleep to.  It's got some good humor, and it has two love stories in it as well, so not just men will enjoy this movie.  All in all, it's a good, mindless action movie to kick off the summer movie season with.  Grab a big bucket of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy!",7,0,0,5 May 2001
Gladiator," Superb movie, one of the greatest ever.
","Gladiator is an amazing movie, featuring sensational cinematography, great special effects and computer graphics, and some of the greatest fights and battles ever seen in a movie.  The shot when the camera pans across the battle field in the opening sequence is amazing, as the viewer sees the arrows streaking across the sky, the catapults launching in order, and the armies marching.  And it was done on computers too, but it looks completely believable.  Great sequence, great movie.  If you haven't seen it, go see it.",10,0,0,23 June 2000
