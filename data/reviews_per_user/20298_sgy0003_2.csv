Iron Man 3," Meh......
","MY first review!After watching the first two films i was really excited about Iron man 3. I just watched it, and i really don't know what to say.Let me first get the good new out of the way; Robert Downey Jr. is still a perfect actor for Tony Stark. In fact, i think all the actors and actresses did their part really well. There were many funny parts of the movie.Now time to go over bad news; I've heard so much about Mandarin and his powers from the ten rings, I expected something flashy. Instead, what the movie got me was.....SPOILER ALERT! the old dude wasn't Mandarin. All the threading poses were just a show. The real Mandarin did not even use the ten rings. I guess not being original with the actual supervillan is common now days(Dark Kinght Rises). After that point the movie was just your typical superhero movie. Tony tries to save Pepper from falling, she does, but she comes back. As for the War Machine, I honestly thought there would be more of him. There weren't nearly as much fighting scenes as the second film did.Overall, I think it is a nice addition to the Marvel movies, but does not leave as much impact as first two Iron Man movies did",1,0,2,3 May 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best I've seen so far
","I have just finished watching this movie. It is amazingI really did not think it was going to be this good. After hearing so many great reviews from friends and relatives alike, I've finally decided to watch it. I love it.The story is amazing the main character Andrew is a pure genius. He manages to build a library in the prison, do taxes for prisoners, guards, and warden alike, comes with perfect escape plan, and exploits Warden's corruption, fakes his identity, and finally gives a gift to his friend Red.I thought the performance were amazing too. Morgan Freeman is just amazing at every act he does. Other actors were pretty damn good as wellwell-deserving 10 out of 10",10,1,2,13 May 2013
