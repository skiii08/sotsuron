Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," This movie takes itself too seriously.
","What I was hoping for when I sat down and watched this was some action and some comedy. I was hoping for a movie that didn't take itself too seriously. Needless to say, this wasn't what I got. I really don't know what to say about the 'vampire' genre anymore except that I really can't stand it. This movie is trite, overdone and completely laughable (not in a good way).Another issue with this movie is the time sequences. The movie moves too quickly with not enough character development to actually allow the viewer to get to know the characters a bit better. Lincoln is a prime example of this as he goes from tragedy to champion vampire murderer in a matter of seconds it seems. More development could have been done with Henry Sturgess' character as well. He seems to completely fade in and out of relevancy.With that out of the way, there are some good technical aspects of the film. The camera work is solid and some of the effects are neat. Rufus Sewell is good too as the villain (a role he seems to excel in). The venues in which the movie was shot made the viewer feel like they were immersed in the past.Imagine the movie 'Zombieland' taking itself seriously. You would then have this movie as the result.",4,1,4,23 October 2012
Sinister," Tension Roller Coaster- Solid Flick!
","Sinister is solid horror flick and one I would recommend going to see if you are fans of the genre. It has some very disturbing moments and the use of 8mm tape is genius and adds to the mood. The acting is strong and Ethan Hawke shines as a 'has-been' author trying to strike it big again before his descent into terror.Another couple of solid notes worth mentioning are the soundtrack and cinematography of the film. Both are excellently done. Both will have you constantly tense and on edge while you constantly strain to see into room corners. Also, the short sequences shot on 8mm tape were excellently done and very disturbing.The storyline itself was weak. As it unfolds, it shouldn't take the viewer long to come to the only possible explanation as to what happened to the various different families as the simplest solution is probably the correct one. After this, all that's left is to wonder about whether the ending is going to be good or bad. The ending was disappointing and the explanation of what was happening from 'Deputy So-and-So' was very contrived.One other note and I'm not really sure if this is a positive or a negative to the film to other people, but I found there was too much tension in the film! The constant darkness the movie seemed to be in started to become familiar to the point that scares weren't having the affect they probably should have. When you are constantly anticipating something, 'surprises' lose their effect.At the end of the day, we go to a scary movie though for thrills and this does deliver in that respect. Its a good horror movie with a strong lead acting performance and should leave most people satisfied. I enjoyed it.",7,0,1,25 October 2012
