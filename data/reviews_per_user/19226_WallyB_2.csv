Minority Report," Hang It Up Boys
","Tom Cruise plays, well, 'Tom Cruise' is this sad pale sci-fi 'product' from the Spielberg factory of over developed concepts. Not a scene went by where I didnt feel poked, prodded and manipulated. So many, many plot holes its amazing this flick could stand up under its own considerable weight.  While we do get a sniff of 'Blade Runner' and 'Total Recall' most of the stink here is pure self-importance on the part of its cinematic creators.  If Cruise is playing a character one degree different than the unpleasantly moody 'Ethan Hunt' of 'M.I.' it certainly isnt obvious.  Spielberg's direction provides neither awe nor wonder and few if any surprises or mystery.  The SFX were unimpressive, especially the much touted fight / chase sequence - much looking like it was lifted from a Playstation 2 Racing Game cartridge.While this IS the type of movie you want to see on a big screen, it's doubtful you'll feel you got your $9 worth.",1,4,8,27 June 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Reloaded.....with blanks.
","Yes, dazzling effects.  Big deal.  Dazzling effects are expected in effects movies.  The storyline, apart from the basic three sentence plot description, defies understanding.  'The Architect' ? give me a break. More bull**** shoveled here than The X Files Movie.The Burly Brawl is just a fight, big deal, ooh ooh, lots of Agent Smiths but to what end ?  Big car crash chase, ho hum.This movie was an overblown mess in search of a story.A Kung Fu B movie with 200 million dollars worth of SFX is still a B movie.",1,0,1,28 May 2003
