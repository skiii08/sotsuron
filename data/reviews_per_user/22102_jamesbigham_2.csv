First Man," Disappointed
","After watching the trailer I felt that this film would be an uplifting biopic of human achievement told from the personal perspective of Neil Armstrong. After seeing the film I came away feeling disappointed and let down. The film starts up slow, with the feeling that one has started in the middle or somehow missed something important. I feel that Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Neil Armstrong was a bit weak and very stoic; I'm not sure he smile more than twice. The script (or lack of it) was very bad; there is very little dialog, and a lot of staring into space. The visual effects are very good; however, many of the views feel incomplete (for instance: you hardly ever get a good look at the Saturn V Rocket). The score wasn't bad, it wasn't over the top either. I believe if there would have been more dialog, and less feelings and emotions this film would have been much better. As it is, I personally think they could have cut around a half hour of the film and nobody would ever notice.",6,10,16,1 March 2019
Dunkirk," Great Survival Story!
","Dunkirk is a amazing movie, with great acting, an amazing score, and astonishing sound effects! Fionn Whitehead delivers a amazing although almost wordless performance. That an actor could portray so much emotion without speaking is simply dumbfounding. This movie has a way of drawing you in, and you lose yourself in the story! I couldn't believe that it was only 106 minutes.",10,2,3,23 December 2017
