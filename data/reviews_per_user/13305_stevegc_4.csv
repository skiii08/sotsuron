The King's Speech," Bloody splendid movie
","I say, bloody splendid movie, old boy. That was my best proper British accent. What do you think? Although this isn't an action movie with cars exploding and spies trying to kill one another, I was riveted, on-the-edge-of-my-seat thrilled by this movie. The tension created by the marvelous performances of these brilliant actors was truly inspiring. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush made this material come alive. The back drop of this movie is also a very compelling moment in history. And a not so well known behind-the-curtain peek at the history of the royal family. 'It's pronounce Ma'am like ham not Ma'am like balm' as the Queen would say to everyone she met. Any actor that wins an award for their performance in this movie should stand proud. I would even be alright with it winning best movie of the year ... but don't tell Christopher Nolan I said that.Odds and ends ... when I watch an ensemble piece like this I can't help but pigeon hole each actor into the first character I saw them play or the performance where I first became of aware of them by name. What I mean by that is every time I see Colin Firth, no matter what role he is playing, he is indelibly connected to his role as Mark Darcy in the movie Bridget Jones's Diary for that is the first performance where he managed to make an impression on me. For Geoffrey Rush it's Shine. For Helena Bonham Carter it's Fight Club. For Derek Jacobi it's The Odessa File. For Michael Gambon it's Gosford Park. And for Timothy Spall it's Wormtail from the Harry Potter movies. Which brings me to another interesting note, Gambon, Spall and Bonham Carter have all starred together in the Harry Potter movies. It's a small world.http://scottishtexan.blogspot.com",8,4,7,20 February 2011
Angels & Demons," Who owns the moment of creation?
","Plot Based on the best selling novel by author Dan Brown, Angels & Demons is a popcorn thriller about a symbologist professor named Robert Langdon, played by Tom Hanks, being summoned to the Vatican to assist in foiling a diabolical plot against the church and its cardinals. The pope has died and 4 cardinals are kidnapped before the start of the ceremony to elect a new pope. A cryptic note is sent to the Vatican police that details the intentions of the Illuminati to kill the 4 cardinals and blow up Vatican City. Robert Langdon must decipher the clues and, in a sense, save the church. Along for the ride this time is beautiful and mysterious scientist Dr. Vittoria Vetra played by Ayelet Zurer. Together the two set out on a frantic hunt to find the Path to Illumination. The story is full of church intrigue, power struggles, and violence from within and without the Vatican.Central Conflict One of the themes at the center of this movie is science versus religion. More specifically who owns the moment of creation? CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, is on the eve of proving the God Particle exists that created life in the universe from the collision of matter and anti-matter. The Illuminati choose this as the time to strike back at the Catholic church in an act of vengeance for a previous incident against the Illuminati referred to as La Purga where 4 members of the Illuminati were branded in the chest with crosses and burned at the stake.'Are you not Entertained?' The verdict is Guilty. I was entertained. In a recent Colbert Report interview Ron Howard stated 'The thing that Dan Brown does so well in his novels is he collects all these fringe theories and conspiracy theories, old and new, and combines them in these works of fiction and yet he puts enough verifiable history in there so that it stimulates your imagination and your curiosity while it entertains you.' Ron Howard so succinctly encapsulates why this movie and others like it such as the National Treasure are so successful.Does this movie solve the issue between religion and science? No, but I think it sheds enough light on the subject to spark some interesting conversations that just might make people finally realize that religion and science are not inherently at odds with each other.If you're interested in this movie, you should also check out ...National Treasure National Treasure: Book of Secrets The Third Miracle Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed and of course ...

Terminator Salvation," Please cast Moon Bloodgood in more movies!
","The year is 2018. Judgment day has come and gone leaving humanity in the hands of a few, scattered resistance fighters. Various terminator models roam the post-apocalyptic wasteland either killing or harvesting humans all under the direction of a faceless, computer enemy known as Skynet. And the salvation of the human race rests in the hands of one man ... John Connor.Unfortunately, this plays out more as a guilty pleasure movie than a canonical extension of the James Cameron Terminator series. If the first movie was about saving Sarah Connor, and the second movie was about saving John Connor, this installment seems to be about saving Kyle Reese. This is where the holes in the story begin with me. How does Skynet know about the relationship between Kyle Reese and John Connor? I can understand that they know about John Connor from his FDR style fireside chats over the radio as the leader of the resistance. But how would they know about his relationship with Kyle Reese? Kyle Reese and the T-800 are sent back in time in the year 2029 and yet this is only 2018.In the first Terminator movie Kyle Reese assesses the conflict between man and machine in the following quote, 'That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.' That context helps build the tension in the first 2 movies. Whereas the conflict in this installment is full of less tension because it seems Skynet is content to leave the resistance to its own devices while it's busy in the lab working on schemes. There are no scenes like in the first movie where we see terminators infiltrating resistance camps. That would have been cool. Interesting side note, Arnold's workout buddy Franco Columbo plays the terminator infiltrator that shoots up the resistance camp in Kyle Reese's flash back sequence in the first terminator movie.Influences and flaws: MCG cites such movies as Black Hawk Down, Children of Men, and Road Warrior as influences for this movie. In reality, this movie plays out more like a thinly veiled rip off of those movies while managing to never come close to catching the authenticity or originality of any of those movies.That's probably my biggest complaint about this movie is that there's nothing original about it at all. It's just a rehash of old clichés. Why there's even the cliché post-apocalyptic child, same archetype child as found in the Road Warrior, old Star Trek reruns (Bop!), or Aliens. I half expected her to say ... 'The Terminators mostly come out at night, mostly.' The 60 foot tall harvesters are right out of the movie War of the Worlds. Even the sounds they make are exactly the same as Spielberg's alien harvesters in War of the Worlds. The air battles in the canyons are played out. The terminator motorcycles are straight out of Road Warrior and in fact the entire high way sequence is straight out of Road warrior. The acceptance of Terminators as allies and even mentors for young would be resistance leaders (in this case, Kyle Reese) and not just enemies was already introduced in T2. The final sequences take place at an industrial plant and plays out exactly like the ending of T2. cough, cough, HACK! All the call backs to the original material in the form of 'i'll be back' and 'Come with me if you want to live' felt cheesy instead of inciting nerd nirvana like the call backs did in the recent Star Trek movie.Maybe my problem is that I've seen too many movies and my expectations are set a little high. Or maybe MCG is a hack and this movie should have been held to a higher standard. Nevertheless it feels like they're just cashing in on the Terminator name.Other franchises have been successfully rebooted such as Hulk, Batman and James Bond. I think in those cases, the source material needed a bit of freshness to appeal to modern audiences. This attempt at rebooting falls flat and lacks the fresh approach necessary to over shadow the source material. James Cameron casts a giant shadow. This movie plays out more like a made for TV sci-fi channel attempt at capitalizing on the franchise name instead of a true reboot of the franchise. Being a fan of the series, it was fun to see the T-600 walking around like zombies ineptly attempting to kill humans. But beyond serving up more endoskeleton murder machines walking around with 'crush, kill, destroy' on their little tiny robot brains, this movie doesn't offer much.Characters: A bright spot among the acting was new comer Sam Worthington who plays Marcus Wright. We find out that Marcus Wright is a prototype cyborg used by Cyberdyne systems to infiltrate the human resistance. That is something I would have preferred to find out in the middle of the movie when it's revealed rather than in the TRAILER!!!!!!! Because really that's the only twist in this movie. Other bright spots are Moon Bloodgood who plays a fighter in the resistance and Anton Yelchin who plays Kyle Reese. All the other performances, including Christian Bale who seems to be phoning this one in with his Batman voice, fall flat.'Are you not entertained?' A very qualified yes. It's not so much that I dislike this movie as I think it's forgettable. Really, once you've seen this movie, there won't be any scenes that you'll be talking about with your friends afterwards.If you're interested in this movie, you should also check out ...

Donnie Darko," screamingfoot from New York
","screamingfoot From New York wrote,'I did have a problem with the fact that Donnie had a marker in his hand with which to write the number business on his forearm. Does he sleep with a black marker? And the 2 'bad boys' who just happened to show up at Grandma Death's place.'Donnie is shown picking up the marker when he was sleep walking. He grabbed the marker from the refrigerator marker board that was used throughout the movie.Now this is just a theory about why the two guys were at Grandma Death's house but I believe it was to rob her.  They mention a couple of times in the movie that she was rich and kept jewelry around the house.  Being that she was an invalid and it was Halloween made it a perfect opportunity to rob the place.  Bottom line it was a plot device to have a reason for the Old lady to be in the street to make the car swerve and hit Jena Malone.",Null,0,0,2 August 2003
