Alien 3," Ripley crashes on Fury-161 and an alien comes along.
","It picks up where Aliens leaves off.  Ripley, Hicks, Bishop, and Newt crash on Fury-161 and Ripley has to fight a new kind of xenomorph.  It lacks the good script and creativity that made the other Alien movies work.  It still is a good movie, but if you liked the first two movies, this one might be a small disappointment to some.  This movie has more gore in it which is not appealing to all.",Null,0,0,25 February 1999
Aliens," Ripley returns to LV-426 with Marines to check out why transmissions stopped coming from the colonists.
","A great movie that proves that you can have a second movie in a series that is as good as the first.  Sigourney Weaver does a great job on the character Ripley.  Michael Biehn also does a great job at playing the smart Corporal Hicks.  James Cameron also did a great job on writing the script.  In all, the movie is a great one with good characters and has a lot of suspense.",10,5,6,25 February 1999
