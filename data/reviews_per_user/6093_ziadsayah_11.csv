It," An Achievement in Horror Film Making
","IT !!!!!!! 2017 Cinematic ReleaseThere are No Spoilers in my reviewLet me just tell you how excited I am to review this Amazing phenomenal.IT is the best Film of the year that i have seen so far. It is so Dark so detailed so moving so terrifying so electric and so TenseIn a town where children are disappearing mysteriously and Adults are keeping silentA town where children are being abused and bulliedA town where the children are trying to resolve the mystery and trying to find their lost brothers/sisters and friendsThere are unanswered questions where did this clown come from why is he a curse? Why is he taking children and why are the Adults quiet about it.You get so close to the characters on a very personal level and you get to know them and there life style.The love between friends is stronger than evil.
The characters are well made the cast is brilliant and the story is so scary and terrifying.This Film is so good and worth watching an owning it as a piece of history.IT is moving as well with lots of emotionsOne of the best Films of the year and it could get some Oscar buzz not sure yet.Last but not least I believe horror Films with kids acting tend to be more terrifying and scary as you are colliding pure souls with evil. Such Films as Annabelle 2 Creation, Also Stranger things the series on Netflix.A huge 10/10Go see it it is worth every minute.",10,0,2,16 July 2019

Us," A Confusing Masterpiece
","US !!!!! 2019 CINEMATIC RELEASEJordan Peele has his own way of delivering a message to the people.He did it in Get Out and he delivered a very strong message.We all thought US, was relatable or it follows Get Out or a Prequel to Get Out, however it is not related to Jordan Peele first film.US, is a standalone original new horror film that talks about your own mind and your own Soul, which can be against you, can be deadly and can be pure evil. Can it be controlled?I am 50/50 about this film. I dont understand why they come from the underground and not through a spirit? Why they come from an a musement park near a beach? Is this film an imagination of the mind? Does it have political and racial signals and messages? No idea more research needs to be conducted. How do the US know where the others live? So many unanswered questions in Jordan Peeles mind.The thing I loved about this film, is the tension, the acting, the climax. Lupita Nyong'o is a magnificent actress she delivers both of her roles with power and she could lead to the Oscar's again for 2020.US is a film that you need to see more than once and research more about it because it has so much loop holes.I will give it 7/10 for now because of the confusion until further notice.",7,0,3,13 April 2019

The Favourite," A Great Cinematic success in comedy
","The Favourite !!!!! 2018 and 2019 Cinematic ReleaseA hilariously great Film that will keep you laughing from start to finish. A great film that tells you back in the centuries, women did have desire for each other in a very witty and hilarious way and the men clown faces makes you laugh even more. The Wardrobes that were designed for this Film are amazing.This is a marvelous film making with such funny acting, the chemistry between all actors is just devine and so raw and original.The cinematography is different than I have ever seen in any film, from the way they handled the camera work, to the way the whole film was made is just outstanding. The Camera angles are genious.Olivia colman's performance Is absolutely oscar worthy and she should be nominated from her funny humour to her suffering to her secret affairs she is just amazing, she blends in her character so well. She is just an amazing actress and always has been.Rachel Weiz and Emma Stone also performed so outstandingly good they both should be nominated for supporting roles. The way the delivered was so original. By far Emma Stone best performance to me.The magic of this film that made me love it, is the chemistry and the funny story behind it and the whole idea if this old England and English Humour is so good.The only let down in this film, is the ending which I was expecting it to be better and some Revenge made.All in All an outstanding film to see and enjoy8/10 highly recommended.",8,3,6,6 January 2019
The Lion King," Lion King Graphically too real and emotionally failed badly
","I wanted to love this film so much and I did not. No Facial expressions, Less emotions and terrible voice overs.Why was this film made too real? They should of done it like the Jungle Book. I felt so bored, sleepy and the ending was not effective. I am so unhappy that this Grant film in 1994 wasn't made as good.",5,1,2,27 July 2019

Joker," A MASTERPIECE THAT COMES FROM A DARK PLACE, A SAD PLACE, THIS IS HIS OSCAR MOMENT
","JOKER !!!! 2019 CINEMATIC RELEASEDC COMICSI BELIEVE THAT JACQUIN PHOENIX IS NOW THE REAL JOKER. HEATH LEDGER WAS AMAZING HOWEVER JACQUIN IS PHENOMENAL AND LEGENDARY.This film activates so much in your mind, about how this world is neglecting mental health and how they expect everyone to behave the same. Sometimes you cannot sitdown and explain things to people because people simply dont understand.
This film potrays that the constent meetings the constent talks that are useless and uncessary. He as an actor and his character makes you realize so much things and so much truth, because it happens in reality. If someone rich dies the world cries but if someone with an illness such as mentality dies in an alley way, the world does not care at all.This film is dark, powerful, and so disturbing. Jacquin Phoenix is going to win the oscar for this and if he does not then he is robbed. You will be transended into a different world in this film.Must see a piece of masterful art of work in film making. The Score is amazing too and the cinematography is unimaginably beautiful.JOKER SAID WILL MY DEATH MAKE MORE SENSE THAN MY LIFE.10/10",10,1,1,11 October 2019
It Chapter Two," A very Terrifying ride, however gaps were missing
","IT CHAPTER 2- 2019 CINEMATIC RELEASEWhen we see a film that we love like the first IT in 2017 we want the 2nd film to be the same, or better and with added scares and excitement.I had no doubt in my mind when I walked into the cinema to see IT chapter 2. I was so impressed by the way the film was made, the concept of it, the characters and the idea of feeling so emotional for them, feeling their fear and the way they have to go through this curse together. It was all so personal to them, so haunting and so scary.The thing that I felt was missing in the film which I think would have been a great idea even though they may not appear in the book, was getting the people of Derry involved in the Curse. Reason why every 27 years kids go missing without a trace and people dying without a reason. That would have added so much more excitement to the film.
Adding also to the film is seeing people getting punished for the crimes they have committed, you will understand this part once you see the film specifically the first scene.Anyhow I love the movie, it is long and very detailed film about the characters. It is more scarier than the first film and more tense from start to finish. I recommend it to all and to Horror lovers.I give IT Chapter 2 a deserving 8/10",8,0,0,21 September 2019
