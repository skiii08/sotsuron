The Blair Witch Project," Overall, a good piece of work...
","I went to see this film despite many people telling me not to bother. People were telling me that it was awful, that the camera work made them ill, or, even worse, that 'there were no special effects in it'.I went anyway.  I thought it was a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood cr*p that's released.  At the time, the film really did scare me (a little!).  I felt my pulse rising in parts of the film, and I generally felt anxious - something that rarely happens to me from watching a film of any sort.I missed out on most of the plot links the first time, and it wasn't until later that I realised the significance of some features of the plot, for example, Mike facing the corner at the end of the film, or the three piles of rocks outside the tent.As I said, this film was a refreshing change to the normal Hollywood horror film you get these days.  You don't get to see what's actually frightening the trio - there are no ludicrous CGI monsters, no over-to-top gore effects. It's an original piece of work, that worked out very well for the writers/directors.Although many films and series have tried to emulate this film since its release, I don't think it would ever work again.  This line is closed.I watched the film again a couple of nights ago.  This time it didn't scare me at all.  I suppose it was because I knew what was going to happen.So, to summarise.  The Blair Witch Project is a refreshing break from the norm.  It's original and it's genuinely spooky.  BUT, don't watch it more than once - it's a waste of time.",Null,0,1,25 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What the hell was he thinking???
","Maybe it's just that I am one of the ones who grew up with Star Wars (I still remember going to see ROTJ when I was 6 years old), but this film was a HUGE disappointment.There was so much hype surrounding it when it was released, and I'd heard that it was not much good, but I finally got the chance to see it the other day (just had Sky Digital installed).It wasn't ALL bad.  It had some pretty decent moments.  But on the whole it was pretty dire.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Not much. 
Jar Jar Binks.  What's with that then?  Has Lucas gone insane or something? You can see where he was going with it - trying to make the film more acceptable to children (I didn't really understand the original trilogy until I was about 10-11 years old), but in doing so, he's alienated the adult community like myself who could relate the events of the film to the original three.  Binks is a BIG failure, as I'm sure tha majority of people agree.  If Lucas doesn't leave the character out of Ep 2, he might as well not bother with Ep 3!Plot inconsistencies.  Not too many that I can think of.  The big one being that in 4/5/6, Kenobi was supposedly trained by Yoda.  In 1, he's been trained by Qui-Gon Jinn.To sum up, this is fine as a kids film, but if you're one of the original Star Wars fans, you won't find much satisfaction here.One last point: 'Attack of the Clones'???  Yup, Lucas has gone insane.",Null,0,1,3 September 2001
Pitch Black," Not bad, but hardly original.
","I saw this film on DVD last night.  In short, I thought it was pretty good, but not exactly original.  The basic plot has been done many times before (e.g. Alien/Aliens).  It had a number of good points.  The special effects were pretty good, even though it is apparent that the CGI animators STILL haven't quite got the hang of colouring and lighting - some of the creatures look out of place due to the mismatch of colouring.It also had a few technical flaws, such as the double-ringed gas-giant planet (which I'm sure is not possible), and also the fact that the double-eclipse to block the light from both light-sources would be unlikely to occur every 22 years - it would happen on a much larger time scale.Aside from these technical flaws, though, it was a moderately scary film, although I have seen much worse.In all, I'd give it 7/10.",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
