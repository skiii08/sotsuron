Ali," Hard to believe but Will Smith *is* Ali!
","I was amazed at how a combination of 35lbs of muscle, some amazing camera angles and true acting ability made Will Smith Ali...The film appeared (to this 30-something who doesn't remember it first-hand) to hold no punches... Ali's struggle within the political arena of the Nation of Islam, his womanizing (the love scene with Jada was hot!) and the US's ongoing struggle with race issues were all addressed and created a mood that helped me to see how Cassius Clay became 'The Greatest.'There wasn't a bad performance given by anyone and if you can 'see' Jon Voight in Howard Cosell, you're good - my companions had to read the credits to see who played 'the mouth' of sports!Highly recommended - unless you don't like fighting scenes (there's close to 30 minutes of intense boxing scenes but hey, it's Muhammed Ali's story afterall).",8,0,0,21 December 2001
