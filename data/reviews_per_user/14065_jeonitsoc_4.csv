Blade Runner 2049," A philosophical journey in a dystopian future
","I'm a sci-fi addicted guy. I saw all the movies you can possibly name made since 1902 that regard science fiction. I've watched and analyzed Blade Runner for years since i was a little kid, explored old movies seeking spots that could have inspired that movie, and noticed most of the references and analogies in the movies after it. To me, Ridley Scott was extremely lucky to be surrounded by the right people at the right time to achieve such a high quality sci-fi noir movie (the original and final cut versions). Each and every year i hope that some rich talented guy make a movie that can somehow give me the same goose bumps and thrills me with philosophical questions; finally after many many years i've seen a movie that not only entertained me with those, but also delivered some of the most fascinating shots i've ever seen. This movie made me think about our society, about the relations, connections we have with the people around us, with the struggle of any individual to find a purpose, the fight to belong to something. The pace reminds me of those glorious old movies made in the past where every detail had a weight, every expression was a book to decipher. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, it's distant from the style of today for many reasons; exactly like an expansive bottle of Johnnie Walker, some people won't understand the taste and just reject it.",9,3,14,6 October 2017
A Quiet Place," Finally a different sci-fi thriller
","I just finished watching it, all i can say it's that i enjoyed in its qualities and its flaws. Some people argue that some characters do stupid things, but they don't consider the context. Nobody is perfect, and sometimes the smart is not the fittest to survive, sometimes all you need is the luck to understand the answer to your problems at the very last moment, despite the fact that the audience might have understood that 25-40 minutes earlier. Finally a thrilling movie slightly different from the rest, thanks to whoever made this.",7,0,1,4 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star Wars is dead! Long live Star Wars!
","NO SPOILERSThis movie had few main purposes, from the producers point of view. Those are completely fulfilled.This movie purposely cut the ties with the original saga.It's biggest weakness is the producers, you can see which scenes were forced in by those with the money. I would say that a lot of money were coming from a country named China. You could say this movie targeted Chinese customers who are not very fond with the SW original trilogy, and even less with the episodes I, II and III. 
The plot choices are not bad, on the contrary, the writers knew they couldn't make something too close to the original feel, so they decided to explore ways that could hurt your expectations. It has great moments that are really enjoyable, considering that we're still watching a Star Wars movie, nothing serious, it's a sci-fi fantasy epic saga in a galaxy far far away... but this time the galaxy doesn't feel so far away, you can clearly see and count each and every 'quotation scene' from other movies, from the series 'clone wars' and so on. The old magic of the Star Wars universe in my personal opinion has been slightly ruined, still i think this is a proper Star Wars movie, maybe not between the best, but still very enjoyable. 
There are though parts were it's clear that they are selling toys, and this kinda hurts my feelings.
All this conflict between the new and the old, is well described in the first part of the movie through the character of Luke.
I liked it, because i entered the cinema with no expectation and strangely no hype, and was a bit stoned (not enough to not see these little details that hurt my eyes and my feelings)",7,1,7,14 December 2017
Alien: Covenant," Not a bad movie
","I don't understand why other IMDb users can't appreciate this average sci-fi movie. The plot is kinda interesting, fills few holes left in prometheus, has the proper amount of gory action, a female fighter, super cool color palette, and a dark yet nice main protagonist (David). What did you expect? An original movie? Are you kidding yourself? Alien is 30 years old; the Giger's drawings are maybe 40-45 years old. Why criticize a well packaged Hollywood product of entertainment? It is a nice sci-fi alien-ish movie.",6,1,7,20 May 2017
