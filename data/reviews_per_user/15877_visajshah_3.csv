Casablanca," Simple story in a Complex setting done beautifully!!!
","I say a 'simple' story because I am writing this piece after almost 77 years of the film's release, but in 1942, this story would have been quite original and new. The film naturally and flawlessly integrates a moving love story with the War backdrop. Bogart and Bergman make you feel the love through their expressions and emotions. Top-notch acting by the entire cast makes Casablanca one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. The film is crisp and fast and manages to keep you hooked throughout with its thriller element. With so many stories going on, you will be hooked to the screen.",9,10,10,26 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Tribute to Hollywood... from Hollywood
","This film pays a long due tribute to the Hollywood and the very fact that it comes from the acclaimed auteur Quentin Tarantino makes it even more meaningful. Excellent direction and fabulous acting, on part of all 3 leads, make this a must-watch. Though slow and meandering in the first half, the film sums it up in a beautiful (slightly comic!!!) manner.",8,7,19,20 August 2019
The Matrix," Heads off to the Conception and Execution!!!
",The Matrix has an out-of-the-world concept something which you might have thought about in your 'dream'. The visuals are stunning and way ahead of time. One of the best Sci-Fi movies. The movie is very well made especially the action sequences. Keeps you hooked throughout.,9,1,1,19 August 2019
