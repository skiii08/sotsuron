Iron Man 3," Great entertainment but shouldn't be Iron Man 3
","Keeping it short and sweet, 'Iron Man 3' does not live up to the standard the first two Marvel creations paved over the last five years. John Favreau's replacement director, Shane Black took the reigns on the third installment and Marvel clearly provided him freedom within its creation. While the action holds up, fun choreography blended with Tony's new tech there are some major plot holes. Over the years Stark's suits (MK 7-8) have endured encounters with: Thor the God of Thunder, Ivan Vanko's reigns of lightning...oh and a trip through a worm hole whilst battling the alien race, Chtauri. These old suit model types are outdated and yet his MK 47 in IM3 cannot withstand the heat from Guy Pearce's poorly explained fire-henchman. This, I just cannot understand.For me this was a disappointing end to the Stark/Iron Man legacy. Favreau should have held the torch til the end. This movie will receive some very varied reviews, no doubt. Hell, I'll watch it again just for the entertainment and good chuckles.6/10.",7,3,6,30 April 2013
Cloverfield," Brilliant.
","When the first indescribably spontaneous trailer for 'Cloverfield' previewed, Abrams and co. effectively threw the absorbent mystery net over the viewers. Releasing the brilliantly teasing two minute trailer of a ravaged national sculpture being tossed through NYC and supporting text other than 'Produced by J.J Abrams' - no movie title. Terrorist movie? Monster movie? Disaster movie? What we acquired about J.J's style from 'Lost' was that there were no limitations. This movie was spectacularly marketed. The opening character meet and greet serves a comfortable introduction to the characters who endure the mystery J.J has in store for them. Deciding on a slightly less recognisable cast really allowed the interest in the characters to flourish, with no John Mcclane's or James Bond's to assure us they'll get the girl and save the world. 'Cloverfield' is boldly portrayed, tensely gripping and since its release in 2008 has been a monster movie unrivaled (arguably until Abrams returned with 'Super 8' in 2011).8/10.",8,1,2,30 April 2013
Drive," Superb
","The opening credits flash Grand Theft Auto's 'Vice City' hints, with its cool and classy pink font, introducing us in style to Gosling's 'Driver' for the first time. Yes, Gosling's Driver. He absorbs the character as valiantly as Robert Downey Jr.'s 'Iron Man'. Very few names spring to mind when imagining a replacement. I automatically fell for his majestically mysterious character. With no name other than Driver, we embark on the leather-glove-wearing-smooth-criminal's story, which is slowly and elegantly leaked out to us over the course of the movie. A part-time stunt man who works with the manipulative and shady Shannon (Cranston) at a car garage and spends more time in his car than his small apartment (which is never seen in full light - not one for interior design maybe?), you cannot expect an easy answer to his story and past.As this profusely poetic performance from Ryan (Yes, first name basis now) develops we are opened up to his expanding character. From a rock skimming gentleman holding the the son of Irene (Carey Mulligan), Benicio as he sleeps. To a driver perspiring confidence behind the wheel of a get-away vehicle and using excessive force when defending those he cares about . Elusive and weary behaviour, limited speech and social contact built from a fantastic lead man, complimented by solid supporting characters (Cranston, Mulligan and Albert Brooks in particular) all combine to create a masterpiece of entertainment.'Drive' is a clear cut example of how 'less is more'. My favourite movie to emerge on to my screen from the movie industry over the last three years.",9,2,5,16 April 2013
Pitch Perfect," Hit and Miss, Give It a Try
","After repeatedly watching the short advert for this movie during TV ads, I caved and rented it. Expecting an sing song version of Step Up, I thought I'd be entertained enough with possible decent dance choreography mixed with funky tracks. However, turned out to feel like a Glee rip off (I don't watch a lot of Glee). Cheesy top 10 tracks, although some I can listen to, felt tacky and weak. Bit too stereotypical for me, but hey, people seem to love it. Some love able characters, Anna Kendrick in particular and Fat Amy provides the most laughter being a new female face in comedy (Rebel Wislon). There's enough laughter and musical numbers to keep many entertained so hats off to them!",4,0,3,19 April 2013
