Sucker Punch," Amazing!
","I loved it! I wasn't really sure what to expect from the previews I saw because the settings did appear to jump around.The effects were great, the costumes were hot of course. The pale color schemes of the Asylum in comparison to the vibrant ones of the alternate settings added a lot.I agree you really had to pay attention to this one when it comes to the plot, which I always like in a movie. The ending was not what I expected at all but definitely not disappointed.Instantly liked the music as well. Cant wait to get the soundtrack when it's available.",10,7,14,3 April 2011
