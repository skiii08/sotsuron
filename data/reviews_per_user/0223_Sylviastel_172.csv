"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Nobody's perfect!
","Friends star David Schwimmer made an impressive directorial debut in this comedic film. The star is Simon Pegg who works at lingerie store as a security guard. He ran away five years ago from his marriage to biracial Libby played wonderfully by Thandie Newton. Libby was pregnant with her son at their wedding that never happened. Well now Libby is dating Hank Azaria's character, a successful American working in London. I love the London film shots. Anyway Dennis Doyle played by Pegg decides to run the marathon. With his friend Gordon and his neighbor, Mr G, who sent him training. Will he give up and quit like he has so many times before. You have to watch and be surprised. It's a great comedy to watch for fun.",8,1,3,31 October 2013
The King's Speech," Colin's Oscar Performance!
","Colin Firth will definitely win an Academy Award for Best Actor for playing King George VI in this film. The true story of a stammering Duke of York who became King of England during World War II is done remarkably well. I adore Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Mother Elizabeth, his wife. The cast is simply first rate. I barely recognized Jennifer Ehle as Geoffrey Rush's wife. Geoffrey Rush did a remarkable job in playing the speech therapist. In any other year, Rush and Carter would win their Oscars. The nominations are all well-deserved. This period piece of British history is done nearly perfect. The story moves on quickly and it's well-done. The writing is first rate. The direction moves quickly. If anybody wanted to know what makes Queen Elizabeth II, this film should help fill in the missing pieces of the scandal of her Uncle King Edward VII and his scandalous relationship with American divorc√©e Wallis Simpson. He left the throne for her. While for those of us who aren't aristocracy, we can't imagine what they're lives are like. Shakespeare has written about kings and men who seek it. Not George VI better known as Bertie. I think he would have rather preferred to be a commoner like the rest of us. Instead, he sacrificed his personal life to lead a nation in it's most difficult time. It's not an easy job even now. Bertie would be very proud of his daughter, Elizabeth II, and her reign as Queen.",9,1,2,5 February 2011
Moneyball," The Best Baseball Movie Ever!
","Brad Pitt surprised me as Oakland A's General manager Billy Beane in this film about actual events. Jonah Hill does a superb job as Peter Brand, the Yale educated assistant manager. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great as the head coach. Hoffman was a great loss as an actor. Billy Beane is a real person. This film is about a two hour love story about the game. This film is for baseball lovers too regardless of what team you're rooting for whether the Oakland Athletics, the New York Yankees, or the Boston Red Sox. The accolades were well deserved for Pitt and Hill. I am not much of a baseball fan to begin with or a sports fan at all but this film made me enjoy the game which can for hours and seven games with a rival. This film is not about money which has overtaken baseball but the love of the game. This film shows how a small underpaid team like the Oakland Athletics can be David to New York Yankees' Goliath.",10,5,6,9 September 2015
Whip It," Ma'am, put down the lip gloss and step away from the mirror.
","Drew Barrymore made her directorial debut in this funny, realistic tale about a girl named Bliss Cavendar from suburban Austin, Texas who became a roller derby girl on a team. Her mother, Brooke (Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden) wants her daughter to become a pageant winner. Ellen Page played Bliss very well. The supporting cast is first rate with Jimmy Fallon; Drew Barrymore; Academy Award nominees Kristen Wiig as a single mother and Juliette Lewis; Daniel Stern as Bliss' father and other familiar faces. Drew takes a story about a girl who rebelled against the norms and parental expectations. Drew did a terrific job in directing and acting. The film is first rate, funny and memorable. You would never know it was Drew's film debut and a worthy one as that.",10,0,0,4 November 2018
Black Swan," I'm Not That Girl Anymore
","Nina Sayers is a hardworking ballerina in a New York City ballet company. She is the perfect ballerina for Odette, the white swan, but she desires to be Odilr, the black swan. Natalie Portman's performance of Nina Sayers is heartbreaking and brilliant. She captures the madness and Nina's inner demons so well. Barbara Hershey is perfect as Nina's mother, Erica. She can be overbearing but she watches her daughter change with this career making role. Unfortunately, Erica shields and protects Nina but she can't save her daughter. Nina's self-destruction is a slow painful process to watch but she had a history of cutting and scratching and self-mutilation. Nina deteriorates quickly and Portman deserved all those accolades for her performance here. The director here also did 'The Wrestler' where the title character also would risk his health for his job. Unlike career wrestling, ballet is a tougher discipline where perfection is sought. Nina's mental health is sacrificed for her career when her mother tries to save her, it is too late. It is a heartbreaking end to such a promising career. If you have the DVD, you can see Tina Sloan (Guiding Light's veteran Lillian Raines) and the director's parents at the gala meeting Nina. I found the movie hard to watch at times. Mila Kunis is wonderful in her role too.",9,1,3,1 April 2015
Frost_Nixon," It Should Be Frank's Oscar!
","If I was a voting member of the academy, I would vote for Frank Langella as Best Actor for his performance as the disgraced president Richard Nixon. I also think Michael Sheen OBE should have been nominated as well but he would easily won in the supporting actor category playing Sir David Frost OBE. Both Frost and his producer, John Birt, were knighted by the Queen. I didn't like the Reston character very much and I have read one of his books on Rev. Jim Jones. Langella and Sheen performed the same roles on Broadway and the West End in London. They did a brilliant job and were both equally brilliant in their roles. I never thought that I would have sympathies for the former disgraced president but I did. I felt Langella brought the role of Nixon from a caricature into a full-fledged multi-dimensional human being. Of course, the President is a human being although they were elected to the highest office in the country. This film is one of the best that I have seen but I would have liked to have seen Nixon's interaction with underused Patty McCormack who plays his devoted and dedicated wife, Patricia.",9,3,6,1 February 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Still Tasteless and Offensive!
","Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat is quite a unique character. The comedian/actor portrays Borat, a Kazakhstan television personality. He goes to America to film a documentary. He starts off in New York City to Washington D.C. to Los Angeles, California in pursuit of Pamela Anderson. The film has some funny moments but they are overshadowed by the anti-Semitism in the film. Apparently in his village, there is a running of the Jew annual event which is not funny but offensive. When he and his partner Azamat stay with a nice older Jewish couple in America, they are so afraid that they leave in the middle of the night. The Anti-Semitism is bad enough for me but it's tasteless and offensive to actual Kazakhs who aren't' Anti-Semitic. Then there is the scenes in which naked Borat and Azamat are fighting naked and chasing each other throughout the hotel in Texas. It's gross and disgusting rather than funny. They are so afraid of Jews that they drive across country in an ice cream truck and they can't get a gun to protect themselves from the Jews so they get a live black bear. It's not funny but just offensive to Jews and to Kazakhs. If Sasha Baron Cohen wasn't Jewish himself, they wouldn't have gotten away with it in the first place.",5,0,1,16 April 2015
Miracle," Best Hockey Film of All Time!
","Kurt Russell should have an Oscar award nomination for his performance as Coach Herb Brooks, the coach for the American team who would compete against the undefeated Soviet Union whose players were all about winning full-time. Kurt Russell is perfect in this role. He has his mannerisms. The film has casted 20 players mostly college aged students to play the actual roles. Patricia Clarkson is perfect as Patty Brooks, the supportive and understanding wife. Al Michaels plays himself who was there when the team performed a miracle. It's a feel good film overall about overcoming the odds. It's a family too. It's also an educational film as well to teach a lesson about teamwork. There are no profanities or violence in it as well except the hockey scenes on the ice but that comes with the territory. It might be the best hockey film of all time. The job was well-done by being faithful and accurate to the story.",8,1,1,13 June 2013
Captain Phillips," I'm The Captain Now!
","The film is based on actual events with American Captain Phillips being taken hostage by ruthless Somali pirates in the ocean. Newcomer Barkhad Abdi earned an Academy Award nomination for his first acting role and it was well-deserved. Abdi nails the complexity of his character Muse, the Somali pirate. Abdi was captured by the ship at first and held captive. Captain Phillips became a hostage getaway. Tom Hanks played Captain Philllips with believable and earnestly. He portrayed him as a father and husband and a fearless leader who wanted the pirates to leave his ship behind with his men aboard the ship unharmed. Captain Phillips tries to get Muse to surrender to the authorities. Just like the men aboard the ship, Muse has bosses who would kill them rather than understand that they only had limited amount of money like $30,000 but their bosses would want more. Abdi and Hanks play very well as amateur and veteran in scenes. The film was believable especially about the fear and terror aboard the ship. The director did a terrific job in recreating the situation.",9,0,2,20 July 2016
The Sound of Music," A Timeless Classic!
","The Sound of Music is one of those films that you can probably recall the words to the songs and memorable lines. Dame Julie Andrews is brilliant as the postulate aspiring nun, Sister Maria, who is sent to help a local military man, Captain Von Trap, played by the brilliant Christopher Plummer to raise his seven children. At first, the children are resistant to Maria's unconventional ways. She makes an attempt to become the friend despite the oldest daughter who doesn't need a mother but does after all. Maria eases her way with the Von Trap children by teaching them how to sing and be children again. She gives them the play clothes made out of curtains or drapes from her bedroom quarters. They sing, play, and have picnics in the beautiful Salzburg mountains. Of course, Maria causes discourse in the Von Trapp family household but she manages to stay on and wins over the Captain Von Trap who was seeing a very beautiful Fraulein Schraeder from Vienna who is not crazy about children. Of course, this story takes place before the rise of Hitler and World War II. When Maria and the Captain come back from their honeymoon, they must face separation with Captain being ordered to serve the Third Reich despite his obvious disdain. The scenes at the Convent are also memorable especially with the late and wonderful Anna Lee MBE as one of the nuns. Again, the scenery, the art direction, the costumes, the music, the writing, and acting are all first rate.",10,2,8,20 April 2008
Catch Me If You Can," A little too long but still a great thrill ride!
","Frank Abernagle Jr. becomes one of the most successful con artists of the last century. He likes to fool people into believing. If he had studied acting, he would have probably gone very far. Frank is played by Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio and Frank Sr., is play by Oscar winner Christopher Walken. The cast is first rate which includes French actress, Nathalie Baye, as his French mother, Ellen Pompeo before Grey's Anatomy, Kitty Carlisle as herself, and the Oscar winner Tom Hanks. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg. The film is quite detailed about Frank's life conning everybody from his parents to everybody else. The film earned several Academy Award nominations. It's a smart film but it's too long. It does bring back the Pan Am airline legacy even for a little while. Before 1991, Pan Am Airlines was the king of the airlines before it closed down due to poor mishandled financial matters and weak security which helped cause the 1988 disaster. The story ends before Pan Am's image is tarnished.",9,1,3,27 April 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Almost Perfect!
","Okay, maybe it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture instead of Ghandhi. It had a great storyline of a young boy Elliot, played by Henry Thomas, who bonds with an alien named E.T. for Extra Terrestial. Of course, people like Peter Coyote is soon out to capture the alien from Elliott's home. His mother, Dee Wallace, is perfectly cast as the divorced mother of three who is unsuspecting of the creature in her home. As a nine year old when this film came out, I was envious the actors who played Elliott and Gertie played none other by Drew Barrymore, a descendant of American acting royalty. The film is a classic family film which should brings families together. I don't think it's my favorite Spielberg film of all time. that would be Jaws. I could watch that film a hundred times and still go in the water but E.T. is a tear-jerker and you might want to keep your Kleenex in reaching distance when you watch this film. I will always treasure the memory of my father who took me and my sister to see this film at the cinema.",10,1,2,19 February 2007
Casablanca," A Brilliant Classic Love Story!
","Of all the films of the last 100 years, Casablanca is still regarded as the ultimate love story up there with Gone with the Wind but it's different. Casablanca didn't have the same expectations as Gone with the Wind. It was filmed in Hollywood during World War II and nowhere near the danger in Northern Africa or Europe at the time. Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart are two star-crossed former lovers who reunite again. The film has Ingrid's character, Elsa, married to Claude Rains's character on the way out of Casablanca to safe. Bogart plays the American club owner with the famous line of 'Play it again, Sam.' Music and love brings the two lovers together. We can't forget the ultimate supporting cast that includes Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and others in this classic film. The writing, acting, and film is all together first rate.",10,1,2,20 April 2008
Lifeboat," Tallulah! Tallulah! Tallulah!
","Tallulah Bankhead made very few films and this one is probably the best known of her film performances. She played Constance Porter, a self-involved wealthy journalist, who was aboard a ship before a Nazi torpedoed it. She survived along with her luggage in the lifeboat by herself until other survivors come along. Bankhead had a history of difficulty and perhaps it is why she never made a film career. Bankhead was better known onstage in theatre. The cast includes other theatre veterans like Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee and more. Mary Anderson and Heather Angel are the only two female supporting roles overshadowed by Bankhead. A film veteran like Walter Slezak also performs. The cast and ensemble work together as a team though surviving in the lifeboat. The film could actually be adapted to a stage production if possible. The film is set in one lifeboat surrounded by water. The director Alfred Hitchcock did an admirable job with this film. Sadly, 'Lifeboat' gets overshadowed by other Hitchcock gems. If you see his entire film catalog, you will 'Lifeboat' as a gem and treasure not to be missed. It should have been nominated for Best Film as well too. I only wondered and worried about what happened at the end of the film. It leaves you hanging and wanting more.",9,0,2,2 June 2016
Chinatown," Except for the Ending, this is a classic film!
","This film follows Roman Polanski's mindset. By the time, he directed Chinatown, Polanski had survived the Holocaust in Poland and survived the Manson trial. I know Polanski is guilty of molesting a young girl and fled the country. Those events occurred after this film. For the record, Jack Nicholson is brilliant as Jake, a man with a conscious. Fay Dunaway is brilliant as Mrs. Mulray and the legendary John Huston acting as her father is bone-chilling. The film is the story about life in Los Angeles during the great depression when it was nothing at the time before all the development. It's hard to believe that Los Angeles was once a small town that prospered into the entertainment capital of the world. It has become one of the world's priciest places to live in or around. The story is well-known especially about the relationship between Mrs. Mulray and her father, Mr. Cross. But in 1974, they never would have revealed such truths. After all, Huston plays a powerful wealthy businessman and investor. I am giving it a nine because I dislike the ending. It's chilling for me to see the wrong person to be killed and another character on the way to be victimized.",9,3,7,5 June 2006
I'm Not There," A Rare Find in Films Today!
","Todd Haynes has delivered his best film to date about the multiple facets of living legend musician, poet, and writer, Bob Dylan. While Dylan has been awarded the Kennedy Center Honors, this film is quite a tribute to the man's legacy and his role forever in the world and not just America. For most of us, Bob Dylan is a songwriter and musician but also philosopher, poet, and activist. His music inspired people and still does. The film is a mixture of six characters including an African American child Marcus Carl Franklin who played Woody in the 1950s. There is Cate Blanchett's well-deserved Oscar nomination for supporting actress as Jude Quinn in the mid-60s in England where the song, 'Mr. Jones,' comes into play. Bruce Greenwood played the inspirational role of a British television journalist. There is Richard Gere in the 1800s small town with his dog, Henry. There is Ben Whishaw who is not used enough in the film. Of course, the late Heath Ledger played a significant role opposite French actress, Charlotte Gainsbourg. Michelle Williams played Coco, an actress, as well. This film is perfect casting. The writing might need more tweaking and the ending was confusing but the originality is what I'll take away from it. This film is a perfect tribute to Bob Dylan.",Null,1,3,22 August 2011
Fight Club," Ed Norton's Brilliant!
","I have to save that this film is entertaining to watch and can be seen multiple times. To me, the twist in the film wasn't a shock. This film is meant to be shocking and a revolution even in the minds of the general public. This film could be used to examine society where men get together and perform fights in order to prove themselves. The fight club becomes one man's obsession and way of life even leading to anarchy, destruction, and illegal activities trying to break away from the dread of life itself. The narrator played by Ed Norton is played brilliantly. He comes across as the average every guy in a dead end job, unhappy, miserable, and seeking a purpose in life by going to support groups for diseases and conditions that he doesn't have in life. It is Helena Bonham Carter's chain smoking character, Marla Singer, that comes into his life to further cause havoc and destruction. He needs reality of others but not another fake member like Singer in his groups to convey his need of belonging and self worth. I could go on but I think you get it. Brad Pitt does also a fine job in his role. The script has some holes in it but it's well done and entertaining.",8,0,2,19 February 2011
Citizen Kane," Spectacular!
","When I first saw Citizen Kane, I did not know what the hype was all about. Since I heard about it on Happy Days, I wanted to see it. After the first few times, it was nothing spectacular. But there is something perfect about this film. I also fell to sympathize Citizen Kane in my last viewing. It is also a purely addictive film. The writing, the casting, the directing, and film-making was absolutely perfect. Nobody in their right mind would change an aspect. Citizen Kane remains today perhaps the most important film of all time to film-makers. They look to see what they can do. Until Citizen Kane, every previous film looked the same. When Citizen Kane came, it changed the film world forever. Not even Titanic would appear as an inferior and insufficient comparison. Titanic is nowhere in the realms of Orson Welles. Kane will forever be challenged. It is truly the best film ever made. One word is simply perfect! Perfect, Mr. Welles.",10,1,3,26 September 1998
Monster," A Depressing Story of Aileen Wuornos!
","I don't know why Aileen Wuornos, American female serial killer, gets more attention than others like Sante Kimes and Karla Homolka. She has a terrible childhood which included abuse of all kinds including sexual, physical, and psychological. Aileen is a tragic figure of society while Charlize Theron plays her quite brilliantly as a sad, tragic figure also a murderer. Most serial killers like Gacy and Bundy are remorseless and refuse to admit any wrong doing but not Aileen who finally confesses to murdering her johns but the motives are vague and unclear. She was probably threatened psychologically from childhood trauma. Unlike most serial killers, she was a detached killer who shot and robbed her victims who were mostly men. The film shows the men in a sympathetic light which is right in this case. The victims deserve sympathy while I feel sympathy for Aileen who I had trouble watching this film because she is so tragic and humanized by Theron's performance. In the end, she faces her fate while most killers sentenced to death fight all the way. Aileen stops the appeals because she wants to face her penalty. Even her relationship with SHelby whose named was changed shows that Aileen did have a conscience and the ability to love that few serial killers or sociopaths are capable of to do at all.",9,0,1,11 March 2008
Shakespeare in Love," Yes, Saving Private Ryan got robbed! But it's still a fine film!
","Shakespeare in Love is an alright film. I like the casting of Tom Wilkinson, Imelda Staunton, Judi Dench, Anthony Sher, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Affleck, etc. It really is a first cast. The script is better than good, almost great. The directing is also first rate. But this is where I agree that another film by Steven Spielberg should have won the Best Picture for the Oscar. What Shakespeare lacked, Spielberg well provided for in his triumphant film of the Normandy landing. Yes, Tom Stoppard is a wonderful playwright, very cerebral, and it is a good love story. I don't think it was Paltrow's finest performance to date but then I like Shallow Hal better. The film is worthy to watch for historic and educational purposes. It is also a very entertaining film as well. It has a humorous moments. First of all, Judi should have won an Oscar for a role earlier in her performance in 'Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown.' Like another film, she gets honored a year later for an 8 minutes performance (a record). Maybe they forgot Beatrice Straight's performance in Network which won an Oscar as well.",9,0,1,23 April 2006
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Are those sad tissues or happy tissues?
","I was surprised that I would enjoy the film as much as I did though. I enjoyed seeing Hawaii onscreen. Jason Segel wrote and acted as Peter, a composer, who breaks up with Sarah Marshall, a television crime drama star. To get over it, he goes to Hawaii where Sarah and her new boyfriend, Aldous (Russell Brand) also vacation. What are the odds that they would end up in the same resort? A great cast makes the film worthwhile. I enjoyed seeing Kristin Wiig, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and others. If it doesn't make you want to go to Hawai, nothing will. I enjoyed the Hawaiian background probably best of all. The film has some comedic moments and doesn't try to go too far.",8,3,4,4 July 2019
The Hunger Games," What will happen next?
","Suzanne Collins' trilogy begins with the Hunger Games in the futuristic society where every year 24 are selected from 12 districts. Jennifer Lawrence delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Katniss Everdeen who goes in for her sister. She and another boy about her age from their hungry poor village in the outbacks of the capitol. The future looks grim and depressing in Catniss's community. Once she is selected, she and the other guy are sent to the Capitol. I have to say that the make up, hair, and costumes are outlandish, strange, and even bizarre. The people in the Capitol seem to relish the hunger games. While the future has the inevitable society catastrophe of wars, drought and famine, the Capitol city seems untouched. What bothers me about this movie is the violence and children caught in this horrific game of survival viewed by the world. I wonder why others didn't volunteer to enter the hunger games instead of children who stood no chance. It's a brutal film. I am becoming a fan of Jennifer Lawrence who does a terrific job here and deserves a second Oscar nomination. She reminded me of her role in 'Winter's Bone.'",8,3,8,13 September 2012
Argo," Suspenseful Escape from Iran!
","Ben Affleck plays Tony Mendez, CIA officer, who plans to rescue six escaped Americand from the Canadian Embassy in Tehran, Iran during the Revolution. This film won the Academy Award for best picture. It is an entertaining film though with an all star cast. Oscar winner Alan Arkin and Emmy winner John Goodman play Hollywood director and master make up artist who aids Mendez. Under the pretense of making a film, the six Americans would be Canadians visiting locations under assumed identities. Victor Garber plays the Canadian ambassador to Iran. The film uses archive footage from news. It was a wise decision than play actors and actresses in their roles. Affleck does a better job as director. He does a brilliant job in redirecting the actual events and the film is well deserved of accolades.",10,1,4,22 August 2015
The Rocker," Pure Enjoyment!
","Peter Cattaneo MBE is probably best known for his hit film, 'The Full Monty.' But here, he really utilizes top character actors and actresses to create some memorable and humorous moments. Rainn Wilson maybe the star but he's not alone. Jeff Garlin and Jane Lynch plays his brother-in-law and sister. Christina Applegate plays the mom of one of the musicians. The story isn't as sweet or vulgar as one would think of today's comedies. The only questionable scene is Rainn's character is naked for the rehearsal which lands him better known as the naked drummer. The beginning is humorous with Fred Armesen and Will Arnett as members of Vesuvius who ditched the drummer, Robert Fishman (Rain's character) right on the verge of stardom. Fish retrieves to having a somewhat normal life even has a normal girlfriend played for a few minutes by Jane Krakowski. Jason Sudekis plays the band's manager. Howard Hesseman plays their RV driver. I loved the casting of this film because of all the familiar faces. Jane Lynch is one of my favorite actresses because she can be both dramatic and comedic at once. This film is rated PG-13 and I think it has to do with that one nude scene but apart from that. They really have a message about working together as a team. This film wouldn't have been made without the teamwork of the cast and crew itself.",8,14,18,3 July 2010
Madagascar," Colorful and First Rate Graphics!
",Animated movies like this one has supplied both quality for families and audiences alike. The story of a few animals at the Central Park Zoo in New York City takes an interesting turn when they are shipped off to a preserve in Kenya but things don't go according to plan. David Schwimmer's voice as Melman reminds you of his character of Ross on Friends. Melman the Giraffe is neurotic and hypochondriac. Jada Pinket Smith's voice is the hippo. Chris Rock's voice is the Zebra who makes a daring escape in Grand Central Station. Ben Stiller's voice is Alex the Lion who is surprisingly dramatic at the right moments in the film. The animation is first rate with almost realistic looking scenes of the city and the island. The story has some weaknesses but the characters are delightful and the kids will love it.,Null,0,0,11 August 2011
Brokeback Mountain," Why Brokeback Lost the Oscar?
","Do you really want to know why it didn't win the Oscar? Well maybe because prior to the Academy Awards, we were bombarded with how great this film was. It was considered groundbreaking, controversial, etc. and it widely praised. Did it ever occur to anybody that it would turn off the Oscar Voters? Of course it didn't that would be too easy, you make a film and promote it so heavily that brokeback fever became brokeback annoyance. You just wanted to get away from all the hype. I hated seeing the signs on the London tubes and billboards everywhere. This film was not going to get to me as it did others. I'm too strong for that. Just like Titanic which I never saw, I got sick of hearing about how wonderful Brokeback is. I think Mad TV depicted a great sketch about it with two girls. When one said 'I wish I could quit you but my husband won't let me?' and the other replied 'My husband drove me up here.' THe first replied 'My husband is over there.' I have to say that I never laughed so hard because that was the depth of the film itself. So Crash beat Brokeback, finally a film inspired by life in Los ANgeles for a change, set in Hollywood and filmed there. Who are the Hollywood Oscar voters? The people who work there that's who. THey didn't film Crash in Vancouver because they could for cheaper but anyway, who gets the last laugh. Now if only I bet on Crash in the first place. By the way since I wrote this interview, I got a very negative email about my comment. Funny, I have written over 400 reviews for this site and this one came back. I won't delete this review because I think I have something important to say about the film itself. I don't care about the homosexuality. I am a liberal lefty feminist who does support gay rights to marry, adopt children, divorce and equal rights to benefits. I am not homophobic in the least and if you think I am then I recommend reading some of my other reviews for Portrait of a Marriage and Paris Was a Woman. Just for the record, this is only a movie.",2,3,43,21 August 2006
Home Alone," Be Careful what you wish for, you just might get it!
","I don't know why I avoided this film. It's a John Hughes classic film in his style of American suburbia. Macaulay Culkin has the startling role as Kevin McAllister in suburban Chicago town in a beautiful home. He plays the child precociously and with vulnerability at eight years old. After he is banished to the attic, he is forgotten the next day after his parents fly to Paris, France for a family holiday. There were fifteen in all. The scene where they are racing to the plane would be unrealistic today. Kevin believes his family left him alone. With two burglars played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, Kevin learns of their plot to burglarize his home as the silver tuna. Kevin's mother realized that she forgot him at home. Worried and desperate, she would do anything to reunite with them. There are noticeable Chicago actors like Ann Whitney and Alan Wilder in minor roles. Of course, there is John Candy in a small role as well. The cast did an excellent job with their roles. The film wasn't expected to be such a hit at the box office. You can watch this film repeatedly and still enjoy it like other John Hughes films.",10,0,1,4 June 2017
Spotlight," If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one.
","There are two films to see if you are studying to be a journalist. Spotlight is one and then there is 'All The Presidents' Men' about the abuse of power in the highest offices. Spotlight recounts how the Boston Globe uncovered not only the abuse but the massive cover-up to the Cardinal to protect their pedophile priests which became the first story in a worldwide scandal about abusive priests. We are now hearing about nuns being abused by priests. As a lifelong Catholic, I was fortunate that I wasn't a victim of such abuse. This film isn't about the abuse although horrible and massive to have thousands of survivors come forward but it is about the institution of the Catholic Church who abused their power in failing to protect vulnerable, innocent children from such horrific abuse. I know that the Catholic Church is not infallible. They are at fault for allowing such heinous but crimes but they are not alone. There are other religious organizations who have survivors coming forward about their own abuse. I hope that they don't stop coming forward. Boston was a heavily Catholic city with a strong Catholic influence in its politics and history. Boston was the hometown of the Kennedys and other Irish Catholics. The Catholic Church's power was finally brought down by a newspaper named the Boston Globe who I pray never goes out of business. This is why the press is so important. The cast was first rate and the film won the Best Picture Academy Award.",10,0,0,2 August 2018
Juno," Juno is Above Those Twice Her Age!
","Juno is why we go the movies or at least I do. I want to be touched, moved and enlightened by a story. Juno is a thoughtful and simple story told well. The cast includes well deserved Academy Award nomination for Ellen Page. She carries the character and the film with an honest moving portrayal of a teenager. Juno gets pregnant with her boyfriend's baby. She tried abortion but couldn't go through with it. Seeing an ad in the penny saver, she decides to let a couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) in nearby St Cloud. The story is set in the Minnesota suburbs. Juno lives with parents (Academy Award winner J.K. Simmons and Emmy winner Allison Janney). She has a supportive father and fine stepmother.

","Jake Gyllenhall does an admirable job in playing Robert Graysmith, a San Francisco cartoonist, for the San Francisco Chronicle as the Zodiac Killer becomes known in 1969 and through the 1970s. The Zodiac killer's identity has eluded police even those like Graysmith who become obsessed with the case even risking his marriage and his relationship with his young children. Robert Downey Jr. played Paul Avery, the reporter, in a suitable performance. The rest of the cast is first rate with Chloe Sevigny playing Melanie Graysmith;Dermot Mulroney as a cop; John Carroll Lynch as Lee; and others. The Zodiac story still has eluded police to this day but the story is a fascinating part of history. The victims aren't forgotten but the Zodiac's prime suspect has disappointing results. Despite it all, the Zodiac still eludes us to this day. Who was he and why did he do it? More important was his relationship with the press and the police. He seemed to enjoy toying with them. While I read Graysmith's book on Zodiac, this film does a decent job in recreating historic events in the Zodiac crimes to detail. Maybe I have forgotten some of Graysmith's details but I'll never forget that the Zodiac is still playing games even from beyond the grave.",8,0,0,15 March 2012
Milk," A Great Film But Not Historically Accurate!
","I had to accept Hollywood wasn't going to show the actual history of life in San Francisco in November 1978. The film is great but not accurate as it fails to mention details to better understand Harvey Milk's legacy. He became a gay icon and legend for the gay rights movement. The film is told largely from Milk's perspective with him at a recorder. He knows that he's a target and doesn't see the danger close by. Sean Penn deserved his Academy Award for playing Harvey Milk with a complexity of a multi-dimensional character. The supporting cast is stellar including James Franco as one of his lovers. Alison Pill is terrific as Anne Kronenberg. Victor Garber was fine as Mayor Moscone. Josh Brolin was brilliant as the troubled, unstable Dan White. The film doesn't project all facets of Milk's career. He was largely the most visible gay politician in the seventies and they're have been others like Barney Frank, Christine Quinn, and more to come out and service the public. Gay marriage has finally been legalized in this country.",8,0,2,16 May 2016
Hotel Rwanda," The Timing of the Actual Genocide could not be anymore poignant!
","In 1994, Steven Spielberg and the film, Schindler's List, won countless awards and honors for it's subject on the Holocaust and how one German businessman, Oskar Schindler, caught in the struggle helped save over a thousand lives. Like Paul in Hotel Rwanda, Oskar was a businessman who was seeking opportunity in Cracow. Just like Paul, Oskar saved a thousand lives from the gas chambers and concentration camps. While Rwanda is nowhere near Eastern Europe and is located in Africa, we know very little about Rwanda. In 1994, the Rwandan president was murdered leaving two ethnic groups, the Hutus, and the Tutsis as enemies again. The order was removed. The Hutus were incited by hatred, lies, propaganda, and direction from their leader to kill those 'cockroaches' known as the Tutsis. By the end of the genocide, almost a million Tutsis were murdered. Paul is a hotel manager for a Belgium company, Sabena, who is put in charge. His wife is a Tutsi and he is a Hutu. The hotel has guests played by Nick Nolte who is a Canadian UN Peacekeeper unable to do anything because of red tape and Joaquin Phoenix is a cameraman for a news organization who risks his life to videotape the slaughter on the streets. For those sheltered at the Hotel, Paul maintains that it will be a safe place whether there is enough food, water, or supplies. Paul must bargain with the general who does not believe that he will be found guilty of war crimes against the Tutsis. The horrors of this genocide is not brutal because we don't see much blood but we see bodies lying on lawns and the brainwashed killers with machetes. Paul played by Don Cheadle definitely earned his Academy Award nomination as did Sophie Okeondo who was nominated. I wished it was nominated for best film of the year. Unfortunately, the western nations took their slow time in stopping the genocide. Rwanda does not have oil but coffee and tea. This story is about 1268 refugees who survived the genocide in 1994.",10,0,0,1 April 2007
The Hateful Eight," Daisy smiles and says When you get to hell, John, tell them Daisy sent you...
","The all star cast featured Jennifer Jason Leigh in her Academy Award nominated performance as Daisy, a prisoner who faces death by hanging in Red Rock, Wyoming. Kurt Russell is the bounty hunter John Ruth who brings her by stagecoach to Minnie's haberdashery. There are wonderful performances like Bruce Dern and Samuel L. Jackson. The film is broken into chapters and is set up like a mystery. It can be crude, violent, vulgar and bloody but it's the wild wild west in the 1800s. You can't expect anything less from a Tarantino film. Still I enjoyed it. I hope you do enjoy something different from this director.",10,0,3,16 September 2018
"I, Tonya"," We will never know the truth!
","The Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan scandal of the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics was the biggest ratings winner for the ladies short program. 24 years later, the world has changed and moved on. The figure skating world had other scandals but none topped the Harding-Kerrigan saga. Nancy was Olympic bronze medalist from 1992 and Tonya finished fourth place. Tonya would have probably been okay if she hadn't an abusive ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly in her life. She married him to escape her abusive mother (Allison Janney earned an Academy Award for her performance in this role). Tonya's life was one tragedy after another. She should have been removed from her mother's care as a young child. She was neglected and abused since she was a young child. Tonya's relationship with her mother, Lavona, was abusive and dysfunctional. Her father abandoned them and he was the fifth husband and her fourth child. She was a chain smoking waitress who worked hard to put Tonya through skating lessons. Tonya was a high school dropout with only figure skating on her mind until Jeff entered her life. Margot Robbie escapes into the role of Tonya Harding as a believable tragic figure skater. The film is about Tonya Harding's life not about Nancy Kerrigan. After the scandal, figure skaters earned a lot of money as a result by performing for television specials. If you have any prejudgment about this film, you need to see for yourself and decide for yourself about what really happened in 1994.",10,2,3,18 March 2018
Moana," Moana is Magnificent
","The most recent animated film by Disney is entitled 'Moana' about a Polynesian princess. She lives on a South Pacific Island. Don't know if it's Hawaiian or Polynesian but a major character is named Maui (played by Dwayne the Rock Johnson) as a demigod. Moana is the village chief's daughter. Her grandmother has a tattoo on her back of a stingray. She plans to return as one of them. The animation is first rate with beautiful colors especially the ocean. Moana was the chosen one to return the heart to another island. Tattoos especially on Maui are part of the picture as well. Moana is a likable girl who chooses to follow her heart to the sea and set things right in for her village. I especially liked the beginning of Moana as a young child. The grandmother does a terrific job as the crazy village lady. I enjoyed the colorful graphics and the film's story line. Unlike other Disney films, Moana doesn't have a love interest. Her relationship with Maui was friendship throughout.",9,3,14,8 December 2016
Crash," Breathtaking, horrifying, and yet probably the best film of the year!
","In Hollywood, they should just look outside their walls and gates for a good story. They don't have to travel very far. The story of Crash is complicated to describe but it is an ensemble piece with an excellent cast like Matt Dillon who plays the racist cop with sick father at home fighting with an African American HMO representative for coverage. He takes his anger out on a successful African American couple. Thandie Newton is unrecognizable and believable as the light skinned wife of a successful television director who gets felt up by Dillon's character and humiliated but in the end, there is something called redemption that these characters seek and need to prove that they are not the cruel, heartless, caricatures of society. Matt Dillon's character is a veteran Los Angeles Police Detective but a racist filled with anger and hatred. I hope he is not overlooked for his performance in this film. By the end of it, I wanted more and I saw this film on an airplane screen but I was glued to every word and scene. Brendan Fraser is miscast as the Los Angeles District Attorney. He is just too young. I love William Fichtner who has been around for years and finally getting noticed. Sandra Bullock is wonderfully complicated as Brendan's wife. They both survive a carjacking and are distrustful. The Persian man who loses his place of business because of a break-in and vandalism is also heartbreaking but you end up liking him and feeling sorry for him in the end but who suddenly has hope for the future despite losing everything to hatred. This film is a lot about hatred, prejudice, racism, sexism, and it is also about redemption of the characters. Don Cheadle is also wonderful in his role. I hope the Oscars don't forget about them one bit. It's the film that is worth watching again and again. You want more when it's over and you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films about life in Los Angeles. Finally, the Oscars votes came in and Crash won. The controversy over the other film is ridiculous and the most absurd. This film was not meant to win an Oscar for best film. It was the little film that could. When Haggis directed it, he was not thinking about how many awards this would win for him but the message of optimism in a pessimistic society. I'm glad Crash won over the other film. Roger Ebert named this film of the year in his annual top ten. The other film came in 5. In my opinion, I think the Academy was right in selecting this film. Yes, this film has just as much controversy as the other film does. I won't name it because it's not worth mentioning. It was the upset of the night and I would have loved to have watched it on television but I fell asleep and woke up to the news.",10,1,6,31 December 2005
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," I Don't Completely Get It!
","Maybe there is something wrong with me. I have watched this film twice and I still don't get what all the hoopla is about. I'm not saying that this isn't a dark comedic masterpiece with a first rate cast, director and writing but I don't think it is as funny or dark as it could be. It takes a lot to watch it without being distracted. George C. Scott is brilliant as is Peter Sellers CBE. Sterling Hayden, James Earl Jones ,and Keenan Wynn are also great in the cast. Kubrick was known for his perfectionism and I'm not surprised by this film. It's short and maybe too short. There is a lot going on in the film. There are funny lines like there is no fighting in the war room is classic but that it's about it. The film is too short, too clever for my taste.",9,9,19,16 April 2008
Blades of Glory," You'll laugh yourself seriously!
","Will Ferrell can do almost anything and here is play a sex addicted (heterosexual) American men's single figure skater, Chaz Michael Michales. His main competition is played by John Heder from Napoleon Dynamite as James McElroy who is adopted by a rich billionaire who takes talented orphans and makes them superstars. He's played by the great character actor, William Fichtner ( I remember him from As the World Turns). Heder can actually hold his own playing this gifted, sexually naive, effeminate skater. Both skaters get booted from men's single competition after a fight. So after three and half years of doing ice shows and working at a sports store, McElroy's longtime coach played by Craig T. Nelson reunites them to do pairs skating. Unfortunately, the top American pairs skating is played by the funny Amy Poehler from Saturday Night Live and her real-life husband Will Arnett as Fairchild and Stranz Von Wallenburg. They are like Kitty and Peter Carruthers of their time, another brother-sister team from the United States. The Office's Jenna Fischer plays Kate Von Wallenburg, the younger sister and assistant to her siblings' obsessive quest for the gold. In the meantime, Kate and Jimmy fall for each other but Kate's sister Fairchild has other plans for her sister. The Von Wallenberg siblings are always blaming Kate for their parents death in a car accident as they were driving her to ice skating practice. Of course, there are cameos by Olympic Gold Medalists, Peggy Fleming, Scott Hamilton who plays a commentator and Britan Boitano, and Olympic Silver & Bronze medalist Nancy Kerrigan at the National Skaters ASsociation. Of course, the writers have worked around not setting it around the United States Figure Skating Association and their Olympics is the Wintersports in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It's a funny movie despite some flaws. If only ice skating was about art instead of about how many triple jumps that a person can do in four minutes. Most of the music, costumes, and actions in the figure skating world shown here wouldn't pass the world skating league.",8,0,2,6 August 2007
Horrible Bosses," Could Have Been Better! A disappoint overall!
","The film has such promising hope with a cast like Kevin Spacey, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jason Bateman in there. The premise is three best friends from growing up decide to kill their unsavory bosses like Spacey and Jennifer Aniston who plays a predatory dentist on Charlie Day. Spacey drives Bateman's character crazy. The film begins okay and you think it's going to get better but it doesn't overall. After 90 minutes or so, the film comes to a predictable conclusion. The film has a great cast but the humor in the writing doesn't come across to me. I think the film could have used more light humor instead of bathroom sleazy humor to get it's point across. Julie Bowen has a small role as Spacey's unfaithful wife. The trio of Sudeikis, Day, and Bateman could have delivered a classic but it's mediocre here.",5,1,2,15 October 2012
The Polar Express," Classic Christmas Film!
","Chris Van Allsburg best selling children's book is considered by many to be classic children's literature. The film version is an animated which benefits the story further. Tom Hanks plays the narrator, producer, and the train conductor. The animation is first rate, award winning, and breathtakingly realistic as well. Of course, this is a children's story and there are some dark moments like the girl who didn't have her ticket and the main character who found it and planned to return it to her so she doesn't get kicked off the train and the ending. Of course, I am surprised that there was negative criticism. If I had children, I would love a classic film like this about the true meaning of Christmas. The act of being the giver and the receiver is what the story is about. Let's not talk about the nativity, that's for another story. If It's good enough for Chris Van Allsburg, it's good enough for me.",10,18,26,18 January 2007
Elf," Great Family movie for people of all religions!
","Will Ferrell is a comic genius. Only somebody with his talent could develop naive Buddy the human elf into a great family film. The film is done with a lot of heart and sometimes is even corny but it is a great family film. There is rarely expletives or violence in the film. Will steals this film easily from stars like James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart. If you're looking for a good holiday movie without any preaching, this is it. I wish Artie Lange was doing more acting like this than the Howard Stern show. He is an untapped comic genius in his own right. Artie Lange is the John Belushi of our generation and sadly he has some of the same problems. Will Ferrell is worthy of the success. He is brilliant, likable as Buddy. How can you not love him after seeing him in this film? If you're a fan of SNL, you will know why there are volumes of his best work. He is simply incredible comedic genius and we love him at our house.",10,0,2,6 December 2003
Capote," Brilliant Performance by Hoffman!
","Truman Capote is the subject of this film about his time investigating and writing about the Clutter murders in Holcomb, Kansas. He befriends the murderers, Perry Smith and Richard Hickcock in order to write his book, 'In Cold Blood.' Catherine Keener does a fabulous job in playing Nelle Harper Lee (author of 'To Kill a Mockingbird). Keener does a brilliant job in playing the actual woman. Surprisingly she's still alive but reclusive to give interviews for decades. In many ways, Truman and Nelle were opposites who were both writers. Truman isn't a very likable character in my opinion. He is as shallow at times as the people he writes about. He loved a good party and he needed to be the center of attention. I believe this film shows Truman's inner demons as well. His alcoholism would kill him but he was haunted by his conscience and his relationship with the two murderers. The film director does a fantastic job in recreating life in 1959. The actors who play Smith and Hickcock do a fantastic job. Chris Cooper does a great job in playing Alvin. Bruce Greenwood's performance of Jack Dunphy is adequate as well. The film's cast and crew do a first rate but in all honesty, I didn't care much for Truman Capote. I could see why he was popular but I see right through his pretension to see his corrupt soul.",9,1,1,3 April 2012
Barry Lyndon," Ryan O'Neal's Best Performance to Date!
","Ryan O'Neal has given what should have been an Academy Award nominated performance in a title role of 'Barry Lyndon' with a top notch cast featuring Sir Michael Hordern as the narrator along with Marisa Berenson as his wife and other familiar British theatrical actors in the cast. Sadly, O'Neal wasn't nominated but his performance is stellar perhaps the finest of his long movie career. Stanley Kubrick is the most unlikely director to direct a classic historic piece based on a novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. Of course, my favorite Kubrick film is 'The Shining' and always will be. This film garnered Oscars for art direction, cinematography where natural lighting was preferred, costumes, and original score in music. The film can be slow at times but the pace picks up along the way with Hordern's narration which makes it simply easy to understand the situation. Everybody gives a stellar performance under Kubrick's direction but there are some inappropriate sexual scenes which are overshadowed by the story of Barry Lyndon himself. If you love Kubrick, you will appreciate his take on the typically British novel.",Null,1,2,5 September 2011
Full Metal Jacket," War is Hell!
","I am a fan of Stanley Kubrick's films but this is not one of my favorites. He follows marine soldiers from boot camp on Parris Island where they are dehumanized and demoralized all at once. The marines go to fight in Vietnam where they find themselves an unwanted presence. Matthew Modine plays a soldier and a reporter for the Stars and Stripes newspaper. Modine gives a terrific performance about a man disillusioned with war. Kubrick is a perfectionist and a realist. This film is crude, honest, candid, brutal, and realistic. It is an anti-war film anyway. I still don't understand the ending. The war scenes are realistic and violent all at once.",7,1,3,5 January 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," You Have to Wonder What Happened To Dixon and Mildred!
",This film won Academy Awards for Frances McDormand (Mildred Hayes) and Sam Rockwell (Dixon) and rightfully so. Woody Harrelson won an Academy Award nomination too. The film is carefully constructed with rich character development of the three leads. Frances McDormand is a force to be reckon with any role and she is here too. Peter Dinklage and Clarke Peters have supporting roles too. The film is really a realistic portrait of a small American town. I'm not crazy about the open ending part of the film but you do understand Mildred and Dixon.,10,2,5,18 March 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," Heartbreaking!
","Henry Fonda perhaps give one of the best performances of his career in this film. He delivers one of the best performances in film history. He deserved to win an Oscar for this performance. Jane Darwell delivered a fantastic performance as Ma Joad, the matriarch of the family. Each scene was done perfectly with lighting, acting raw and brilliant, natural, etc. The film is the story of an Oklahoma family who like thousands of families who battled the Dust Bowl, the drought, the poverty, the starvation, the history, etc. This film is a classic based on John Steinbeck's classic novel. The Joads migrate west to California for the California dream of prosperity and better living but they're like thousands of others. It's heartbreaking and dramatic but inspirational about a family's surviving.",10,2,4,20 February 2012
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl's Still Got It!
","After 30 years, Meryl Streep shows that she is still the Queen of the films. This film based on the novel about a young girl played by up and coming Anne Hathaway as a college graduate, Andrea, who has high aspirations in the journalism field. She accepts an assistant job to the dragon lady known as Miranda Priestley who resembles more Leona Helmsley in personality. She is the editor and power broker in the fashion industry of Runway magazine. Think of it as Cosmo or Vogue. As Miranda, Streep steals the scenes. She can make her vicious, complicated, and then vulnerable. She earned an Oscar nomination (her 15th) so far. Despite the film having more youthful roles for Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway, Streep shows that she's tops and why. I loved the scene where Andy runs to Smith and Wollensky's restaurant and I have eaten there and have their steak sauce. It's an excellent restaurant. I love the New York City scenery as well. I was disappointed with the scripting of the film. I thought they could have done better and more. Still I love Stanley Tucci as Nigel and the film is entertaining but not much more. It reminds me my days as an assistant in a New York publishing house. It's not that exciting because it was for computers.",7,0,0,16 January 2009
Romeo + Juliet," It's not for me! I just hated it!
","After only watching a few minutes of this adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, I couldn't take much more of it. It was something that I could laugh at rather than take seriously. I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language, I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that. If there are others happy with it, so be it but not for me.",1,41,77,4 May 2006
Forrest Gump," One of the best, moving, memorable films of the 1990s!
","When I hear the music, I think of how wonderful the world can truly be if there were more Forrest Gumps out there. When the film came out, it was truly breathtaking. It showed that the great and talented Tom Hanks can perform anything. Had this film been released a year before? He would have probably have gotten his first Academy Award for Best Actor. Truthfully, his role in Philadelphia was good but not Forrest Gump. We don't really remember much of the role in the previous film except that he played a Philadelphia attorney dying of AIDS and suing for justice for his termination. While the film, Philadelphia is good. It's not Forrest Gump. What separates Forrest Gump from Philadelphia is that there is so much more going on around the character. I think it's a shame that Sally Field did not get an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for playing his mother and Robin Wright also did not get a nomination for Best Supporting ACtress for playing the love of FOrrest's life. They were some of the best female performances of that year alone. When you hear the music or the soundtrack, you are reminded of the some of the most memorable moments in movie history of a truly remarkable character named Forrest Gump. Gary Sinise was also worth mentioning because he was nominated for BEst Supporting Actor as the man's Vietnam comrade who he saved. That touching moment of when Forrest realizes his gratitude for saving his life is still chilling and touching and remarkable like the film.",10,1,2,26 January 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Fine but Hard To Believe!
","The kidnapping of Amanda McCreary in Boston sets the film in motion with an all star cast and director Ben Affleck based on Denis Lehane's novel. The author wrote Mystic River as well. If the film is an accurate adaptation, there are similarities in storytelling. There are twists and turns in the storyline. The most difficult scenes include that weird family of a drug addict couple and their child molester house mate. The scenes in the house are weird and creepy. Casey Affleck (Ben's brother) is fine in his role but another actor could have been better. The plot and mystery behind the kidnapping is so convoluted and unbelievable. Amy Ryan did a great job in playing the careless mother. The film reminded me of the Casey Anthony case in many ways. At least this film has a happier ending.",7,0,1,1 September 2015
Bridget Jones's Diary," t is a truth universally acknowledged that when one part of your life starts going okay, another falls spectacularly to pieces.
","How would Bridget Jones write this in her diary about her life? This film is a cute, comedic unrealistic commentary on women in their thirties like Bridget Jones played beautifully by Texas American Renee Zellwegger. A role that could have been done by any British actress striving for her big break has been done by one of Hollywood's brightest rising stars. Renee can sure play British and she also plays Beatrix Potter. THe casting choice of her to play this very British role might be shocking but she manages to do this role without being Meryl Streep and being more a talent to watch out for. Bridget's parents are played by the underrated Gemma JOnes and Oscar Winner Jim Broadbent. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant play the men who seek to win Bridget's heart. Firth plays Darcy here and in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice television mini-series and Hugh Grant is famous for playing the lovable loser at love. The film was filmed mostly in London and England. Although you can't stand in any airport for JFK in New York City. Any way, the film is a lot of fun to watch and should be shown over the Christmas holiday season.",8,1,1,10 August 2007
American Hustle," Entertaining but Flawed!
","The cast is awesome especially Louis C.K. In a supporting role as a federal agent. The cast is stellar with A-listers. Amy Adams is unforgettable as a con artist torn between two men. Bradley Cooper and Christian Bale play seventies characters based on a true story. I loved the music, art direction, costumes, and actors but I found the writing to be weak and confusing tone as a viewer. I didn't know what was going I some of the time. Jeremy Renner's Carmine Polito is actually a likable person despite his shady corrupt side. My biggest problem was that the agent and Rosenfeld look so much alike. I often confused Bale and Cooper in their roles. They just look too much alike. I felt Jennifer Lawrence was miscast as Rosalyn Rosenfeld. She was just too young for the role but she did a terrific job anyway. Lawrence is a terrific actress and enjoy her in other films but not here.",8,0,2,13 August 2015

","The Godfather Part II has excellent writing, plotting, editing is even brilliant, acting, and overall quality to watch over again and again. You can never get sick of watching this film. I miss John Cazale. He was truly a gifted actor and I miss him. He played my favorite Corleone brother. Sure Alfredo was never brilliant or vicious but he was sweet, gentle, and warm most of the time. He had a conscience and I despise Michael for killing his own brother. I think he killed him out of jealousy. Alfredo spent more time with Michael's son, Anthony, than he did and he resented him for it. Alfredo could have been spared. Four years after Godfather Part II, John Cazale died of cancer after filming the Deer Hunter. He never won an Oscar or made too many films but he made every role memorable. Rest in Peace, John. I miss you.",10,4,6,14 October 2002
The Aviator," A Long but Classical Film!
","I could see why Leonardo DiCaprio would want to play Howard Hughes. He was an incredible genius but also deeply troubled man. This film shows how Howard Hughes operated with the women in his life like Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Faith, and others. He was paranoid and obsessive compulsive disorder. He was terrified of germs. There are more scenes in the film about his spiraling out of control with his mental illness than anything else. Despite his obvious inflictions, he was truly a brilliant businessman, aviator, and film producer. Nothing was too small or impossible for Howard Hughes. I thought Cate Blanchet deserved her Academy Award for playing iconic actress, Katharine Hepburn. Let's face it, Kate Hepburn was an extraordinarily gifted actress and an American treasure. Blanchett pulled off the performance perfectly to make even Hepburn proud of it. The relationship between Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn was mutual admiration and love even when she left him. Hughes' love for Kate went further than that. The rest of the cast includes Kate Beckinsale (Ava Gardner), Sir Ian Holm, John C. Reilly, Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, etc. Everybody in the film business wants to work with Scorsese and who can blame them. I want to work with him. This film is nearly perfect if not too long at times but truly captures some of Howard Hughes' troubled and successful life.",9,1,1,7 March 2011
Burn After Reading," Entertaining Dark Comedy!

The Washington DC locations highlight the film about how a confidential disk falls in the wrong hands of two gym employees who blackmail and extort information. France's McDormand plays Linda Litzke, a single gym employee who seeks cosmetic surgery. The film is a dark comedy much like Fargo, a film by the Coen brothers. It's entertaining at times. The two married couples who live in upscale DC are equally unhappy. I love the location shots in Washington DC.",8,1,2,17 August 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," You want more after 3 hours
","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring would make the late author very proud. It is extremely well done with a great cast of actors. There are not enough female roles in this story and it is a great story. Who would have thought that Sean Astin grew up to be a hobbit from his days as a 'goonie' and Tobey Maguire who was best known for his role in the Ice Storm as Mike. Now he is the star of the film. He plays beside the wonderful attractive Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, the magnificent Christopher Lee as the dastardly wizard gone arye, Sir Ian McKellen as the wonderful charming gandalf(Sure he could play Macbeth and Shakespearan role but he certainly can play his friend, Dame Maggie Smith, in a Saturday Night Live appearance. He was just perfect and now he plays with his action figures. Then there is wonderful Sir Ian Holm (Just imagine two Sir Ians on the set, what are the chances). The film is about 3 hours and after all that there is still more and you want more. I only wished that they would finally give knighthood to Christopher Lee and John Rhys-Davies.",10,1,2,26 June 2002
21," It Could Have Been Better Though!
","I read the book, 'Bringing Down the House,' about a few years ago so I don't remember the details. The film could drag at times. The cast is wonderful especially Kevin Spacey as Mickey Rosa, Lawrence Fishburne as Cole Williams, Kate Bosworth as Jill Taylor, etc. The cast was fine in their roles even the supporting roles. While the film looks great on paper especially the Las Vegas scenes, the script seems to be the weakest part of the film. It never really flies off the ground. I'm still wondering what happened to Mickey Rosa and his prot√©g√© students who take Las Vegas casinos by storm. They used Planet Hollywood, Riviera, and Red Rock Casinos in this film. Still I think the film could have been much better overall. It did drag at times and I thought it could have been overall. It's still is nice to see a book made to film about blackjack, card counting, and trying to beat the system.

","Sir Mark Rylance earned an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Rudolf Abel, a German immigrant in the United States over espionage in the late fifties. America was going through the McCarthy era where the fear of communism was paranoia. As a daughter of parents who lived through Communism Eastern Europe in the fifties, they immigrated to the United States. The Germany especially the East Berlin side was grim and bleak under communism. This film did a terrific job in relating and bringing the story to life about James Donovan, a lawyer who defended Abel under enormous pressure. His family endured bullying and taunting from friends, neighbors and colleagues. Tom Hanks was perfect in the role by the way. Alan Alda also played a supporting role. Again the film really belonged to Sir Mark Rylance who was also awarded Knighthood for his services as an actor. I could watch him in anything.",9,0,1,20 September 2018
Little Miss Sunshine," A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try.
","When I heard Alan Arkin's name as winner of the Academy Award for Actor in a Supporting Role, I couldn't be more happier. Arkin was well-deserved of this ultimate honor. Arkin played Grandpa who encourages his granddaughter, Olive, in Albuquerque, New Mexico to travel to Long Beach, California to complete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Too expensive to fly, they drive in a yellow unreliable van experiencing one adventure after another. It's an enjoyable film overall.",9,0,0,3 February 2018
Hugo," A Beautiful Cinematic Masterpiece!
","Martin Scorsese adapted and filmed Brian Selznick's illustrated novel to the screen at the insistence and suggestion of his school aged daughter to make this into a movie. Thank God for that! This film is quite beautiful to watch. Sir Brian Kingsley did a fantastic job as a French toy shop owner in a Parisian station. His character Georges encounters Hugo Cabret with a past of his own. After World War I, Paris is between wars and struggles to rebuild. Hugo is one of many orphans. Aside from the stunning acting and art direction, I wished he hired more French actors and actresses. While I love to see Sir Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths, Sasha Baron Cohen,and Frances De La Tour. I enjoy the British cast but felt that they should have cast French actors and actresses in this roles. Still I loved the movie as the power of magic movie making.",10,0,2,22 June 2014
The Shining," Excellent Adaptation!
","I love this movie and I have seen it various times. I love Shelley Duvall playing Wendy Torrance. I think that is the best performance of her career so far. During the filming which they show a documentary after the movie on my tape, they show how Shelley was pushed so far. I guess it was easier in Kubrick's direction to make things rough for her to get the outcome he desperately wanted. Shelley forgave him because the outcome was worth the effort. Kubrick was not known for being a genius for nothing. He had scenes done over a couple hundred times just to get it right. But this film shot in England was worth the effort, Kubrick captured the story nearly perfectly although he altered the outcome slightly. Jack Nicholson might have won three Oscars for other movies but he'll always be remembered for saying 'Here's Johnny' in a demented way. The kid who played Danny Torrance was perfect in the role. I love the imagery and visual art direction that the film provided. I also loved Scatman Crowthers as Danny's friend and the cook. There are few horror films that I watch over and over but this is one because I liked the characters, the story, and the supernaturalness around the hotel. There were questions that it didn't answer but that's okay.",10,0,2,11 October 2006
American Beauty," Just about a perfect film!
","I would give it a 10 but I still think it should have been another actor to win best actor that year. Yes, Kevin Spacey did a brilliant job in this role. He always gives his best in any role. He lives to act in my opinion. Contrary to other people's opinions. He puts 100 percent in the film and he will go down as one of the great American actors in history. Well anyway, I still think and believe that another actor like Richard Farnsworth should have won for his role in Straight Story because it was his last great role and he has spent a lifetime in the movie industry but that's my only complaint. I do have another complaint and that's the gay couple that lived next door. They just seemed almost functional in my opinion in a neighborhood where straight families are generally dysfunctional in the first place. I don't believe there is anything functional about any family regarding their sexual orientation--straight or gay. Everybody's dysfunctional, it would have been nice to see some of it in the gay couple. They just seemed too happy if you know what I mean. Well anyway that's another little problem with the film but it's otherwise a great film overall. I think Annette Bening should have won Best Actress Oscar beating Hilary Swank who won for Boys' Don't Cry that year. Again she was beaten for her role in Being Julia. Kind or ironic? Annette is brilliant. Sam Mendes has a tough act to follow after winning his first Academy award for his first film. Anyway, I thought Mena Suvari and Thora Birch were pretty good in their roles. I didn't even recognize the great Allison Janney as the depressed wife next door. Maybe her son should give her his stuff to make her happy. She's almost zombie like. I love the scene at the drive-thru restaurant. That's American suburbia in my opinion. I loved Peter Gallagher in his small role. I did feel that the main characters did love each other despite their problems. It's heartbreaking at the end of the film. A great film like this makes you think about your life in suburbia or anywhere. Is anybody really happy? Why do we take on roles like working at jobs we hate and pretend to be happy? That's what American Beauty is really about, are we really happy in our lives? Maybe not as much as we could be. I think everybody can be a great actor or actress-pretending to be happy in an unhappy world called the living. Not to sound depressing but when I saw Carolyn trying to sell a house. The scene of her breaking down and crying was the heartache of life in general. It didn't matter if it was the city, suburbia or rural. Maybe it's a film about materialism, Even the rich aren't really happy, neither is the poor.",9,0,3,19 April 2006
Over the Hedge," A Great Family Film even for Adults!
","The animation is quite brilliant and the voices of stars like Allison Janney, Bruce Willis, Thomas Haden Church, Wanda Sykes, Garry Shandling, and Steve Carrell only enhances the film. They play the roles of chipmunk, skunk, squirrel, a bear, and humans in the film. I have to say that the humans were deliciously fun to watch. The woman played by Allison Janney is a typical suburbanite with a deep seeded hatred for pests and rodents in particular. She contacts the exterminator played wonderfully by Thomas Haden Church in the role. Their voices add to the characters. Anyway, she sets up an elaborate system where nothing can live in her backyard. Anyway, the animals that live nearby in the hedge are humanized with voices to develop their character senses. There is a lot of adventure in the film and you wouldn't be human if you didn't want to see the animals win this time. It's a wild ride!",Null,1,1,18 August 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Warning, you'll be offended!
","This film, 'Walk Hard,' is spoof of the biographies on musicians like Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. It means to be light-hearted but there are just some offensive moments in the movie. Apart from the offensiveness particularly the stereotyping of Jews running the music industry, there are some worthy laughs. John C. Reilly can sing and work solo without his buddy Will Ferrell. I love watching him play the dim-witted musician without a sense of smell. Of course, I was offended by his brother's accidental death. He was cut in half during machete fight between young Dewey and his brother. His brother was the favored son. Dewey's mother is played by the wonderful Margo Martindale who also meets a strange demise while listening to her son's song on the radio. It's good to see Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell as his band mates who introduces him to drugs, alcohol, and sex. Christine Wiig plays his first wife. Jenna Fischer plays Darlene Madison who is a take on June Carter. The film is nothing more than silliness but there is some things to be offended about.",4,1,4,20 December 2009
We're the Millers," Make Me Look The Guy!
","Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston play a drug dealer and exotic dancer who pose as suburban parents of teenagers to smuggle in drugs from Mexico. The film includes two awkward teenagers. Emma Roberts and Will Poulter play Casey and Kenny. The cast is first rate and the writing is above average. I enjoy watching Ed Helms as the boss. Luis Guzman deserved better in his small role. Kathryn Hahn and Will Offernan play another couple on vacation. This vacation movie reminds me of the National Lampoon's Vacation more so. Despite them playing a family on the road, they clicked well together. They take a plane from Denver to Tuscon and then rent a massive RV to Mexico. The direction is pretty good. The film has some slow moments but it's worth watching. Jennifer Aniston can pull off as an exotic dancer than her normal girl next door appearance.",7,0,1,31 January 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," Crazy meets Crazy!
","I enjoyed watching Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence as two broken unstable people. He is separated from his wife after the incident. She lost her husband and went sex crazed in her office. As Pat, Cooper does a terrific believable job in portraying him with his mental illness. As Tiffany, Lawrencr won a well deserved Academy Award for best actress. I thought she should have been won for 'The Hunger Games' but she deserved it anyway. Here Lawrence shows why she won as well with a realistic portrayal of a grieving widow. I love Jacki Weaver as the supportive loving mother. She earned her second Oscar nomination. She is a such a great actress. Robert DeNiro plays the dad and did a wonderful job as always. The film was shot on location in Philadelphia area. The Eagles scene was realistic and football is more American than Apple pie. The film is a heartwarming love story.",9,1,3,8 October 2015
In the Name of the Father," Great Cast and writing makes for a wonderful true film about injustice!
","It is no surprise that Peter Postlewaite O.B.E. was rated as one of Steven Spielberg's favorite actors. He gives an understated and well deserved academy award nomination for his performance as the father of Daniel Day-Lewis's character. You learn to easily accept them as father and son in this film. They work very well together. Emma Thompson also get a supporting role as the British lawyer who helps Gerry get out of prison and exonerated for the crimes. The film pulls no punches about the violent persuasion into making a false confession. It breaks your heart to see lies, propaganda, and innocent people going to prison for crimes they didn't commit in the first place but it does happen all the time which is why I am against capital punishment in my country for that reason. The film earned several academy award nominations including for best actor in which Daniel Day Lewis also became a naturalized Irish citizen. He would seem an unlikely candidate for British knighthood like his grandfather now. The film is more relevant today than when it was released. Terrorism has returned with a vengeance. People seem willing to put innocent people behind bars because of their ethnicity. We must learn a valuable lesson in not judging a book by its cover. In the meantime, prison life was not enjoyable but neither torturous. Both Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon are in prison together which makes the situation bearable. In fact the other prisoners are more decent and hospitable than the men who put the innocent men there in the first place. Gerry does honor his father's memory by clearing his injustice.",10,0,4,2 January 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," I'm a virgin. I always have been.
","Compared to the fact that anybody who is still a virgin is often ostracized by non-virgins for not getting. YOu wonder if it's all worth it whether it be the wrong or right person. This movie will please a lot of religious conservatives who make the presumption that you are any less because you are still a virgin. This movie allows a great comedian like Steve Carrell to play the oldest virgin known to mankind because he is so good at acting in general. We grow to admire and like this character unlike his television show. The fact that he has to come forward and admit his virginity is kind of like coming out of the closet. I love Jane Lynch. She is such a great actress and comedienne and deserves to be recognized. She is wonderful in Christopher GUest films and I saw her last night on Charlie Sheen's show and as always, she is wonderful. This movie is good to show for its lightheartedness and its attempt to be different. It's successful at that. It shows virginity in a positive light rather than as a freak show. There a lot more virgins out there but I'm not one of them sadly. I grew up where getting rid of your virginity was a top priority and how sad is that to give it to somebody who never calls you back.",9,1,3,10 January 2006
Ratatouille," Probably the Best Film if Not most Entertaining of 2007!
","Ratatouile is one of those films than can entertain children as well as adults. It's smart, beautifully crafted in animation. The story of a Rat who aspires to be a great French chef like Gusteau, a fictional male Julia Child. He gets caught up watching Gusteau as he learns of his death from television where the resident of the house, an old French lady with a gun, goes literally ballistic when she sees two mice. She blows the ceiling only to discover a scene like in Williard or Ben about a thousand rats living above her. Horrified, she begins shooting like Dick Cheney on vacation. She doesn't stop once they leave her house which almost destroyed. She goes right on separating the main character rat and his family and friends. He begins talking to Gusteau in his cookbook which he uses as a life raft away from the crazy lady with a rifle actually. Slowly, he finds himself at Gusteau's restaurant and slowly warms up to the aspiring human chef.",10,1,2,19 April 2008
54," Sex, Drugs, & Disco
","Ryan Philippe plays Shane from Jersey City, New Jersey. He tells the story of his life at 54 during the last days of the era. Mike Myers is fine as Steve Rubell. There are plenty of familiar faces here. Perhaps, I'm disappointed that Sherry Stringfield was barely used in the film. I enjoyed seeing the twin towers in New York City. I definitely understood where Shane was coming from in actuality. New York City always looks better from the New Jersey side. I grew up in New Jersey where you aspire to be there. New York City in the seventies and eighties were exciting, fun, and gritty. I wouldn't have mind living then there. it's not the same New York City anymore. Club 54 was the ultimate place to be in the city. this film does a fine story in telling the story of 54 in the final months. Every party ends somehow and it did for Steve Rubell.",7,0,0,14 August 2015
American History X," I'm the most dangerous man in this prison. You know why? 'Cause I control the underwear.
","Edward Norton and Edward Furlong, play two brothers. Norton is the older brother, Derek and Furlong played the younger brother, Danny. Their father is murdered. The cast is first rate with Beverly D'Angelo playing their mother, Doris. The story about the two brothers is that is a convicted ex-con who killed two African American men while they were robbing their family home. He gets sentenced to 3 years at Chino prison where he learns to change his racist point of view.The movie is quite powerful and not for children. The black and white scenes are the past and the present is in color. The scene in the prison shower is not an easy one to watch neither is the killing scene. The director shows the ugliness of hate in the family home and in the community. They have a great cast like Avery Brooks, Stacy Keach, William Russ, Jennifer Lien. It's a sad story! It's a movie that will make you think about things.I think Elliott Gould also gave a great performance. The film still packs a punch twenty years later and beyond. Perhaps times hasn't changed as much.",8,0,1,5 June 2010
Enchanted," Simply an Enchanting Movie! Take it to Broadway!
","Amy Adams is simply delightful as Giselle, the engaged woman of Prince Edward, in a land called Anadalusia, a land where it lives in Animation. The beginning is a bit slow and typical. Once Giselle is tricked and pushed into the wishing well by a witch who is really Edward's evil stepmother. The cast is first rate with Amy Adams as Giselle, James Marsden as Prince Edward, Timothy Spall OBE as Nathaniel- the queen's henchman, Susan Sarandon as the wicked stepmother, Tony Winner Idina Menzel who won for playing Elfaba on Broadway's Wicked plays Nancy, the girlfriend, of PAtrick Dempsey's character, Robert. Robert takes Giselle in because his six year old motherless daughter, Morgan, insists that she is a princess. Of course, this is a Disney film. I'm sorry that one of the songs didn't win the Academy award for Best Original Song. I think this movie can be adapted into a Broadway musical since Disney pretty much dominates Broadway shows especially musicals.",8,0,1,20 June 2008

Bess, the Duke, and Duchess form an unusual trio in a very complex relationship. Bess was Georgiana's best and only true friend. The film has a remarkable cast with Ralph Fiennes as the Duke.

Dirty Dancing," Dirty Dancing Coming to Broadway for it's 20th anniversary!
","There was talk on the E! Hollywood Special about the Making of Dirty Dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies. Maybe the music, the dancing, or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becoming a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this film established Jennifer Grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally. Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit. It has the love story, the music, and most of all lots of dancing. Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily. it is nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother. It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations. At the end of the film, it is sad to see the hotel owner, Kellerman, be baffled by the next generation. It happened anyway! Most people prefer cruises and traveling through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills. Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos. Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever, this should be a no brainer! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times. There are people that have probably seen this film-a 1,000 times by now. Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old. Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times. I watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heart throb, Johnny Castle. Nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music, two soundtracks, and even a tour in the late eighties. I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical. It would work for the audience to be part of a film. No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again. Well, Australia and London both have had productions of Dirty Dancing. It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary.",10,52,92,24 June 2004
To Rome With Love," With age comes wisdom. John: With age comes exhaustion.
","Woody Allen is best known for playing neurotic New Yorkers for decades. Here, he plays a retired opera conductor whose daughter has relocated to Rome, Italy. Woody Allen has written, directed, acted and produced an all star cast with Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Judy Davis and Allison Pill in the cast. The film is centered around Roman landmarks like the Trevi Fountain and Piazza Navona. The stories don't intermingle. Davis and Allen played a retired couple visiting their daughter and make a discovery in the shower. Alec Baldwin guides Jesse Eisenberg through a love triangle during his stay. Roberto Benigni and Penelope Cruz also star in this film. There are some scenes done completely in Italian with subtitles. Woody Allen wanted to pay homage to the great Italian film directors like Fellini and others in this film. The film is not so serious but delightful and entertaining to watch overall.",6,2,3,26 June 2018
Bridesmaids," Disappointed!
","I'm wondering how this film earned Academy Award nominations for best supporting actress (Melissa McCarthy) and Kristen Wiig for original screenplay. They didn't win the awards but I'm wondering how this film got nominations in the first place. Wiig wrote and played the main role of Annie, a failed baker, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her best friend played by Maya Rudolph is getting married and she's maid of honor too. The previews made the film look funny but it is actually sad and awkward at times. Annie feels and acts like a failure because she had low self esteem. McCarthy is always a hoot but I didn't understand her character as the groom's sister. Wiig is talented in her character's self- deprecating sense of humor. I just wished the film had more funny moments. This is first rate cast including the late great actress Jill Clayburgh as Annie's mother in probably one of her last film performances. The trip to Las Vegas was a total waste in actuality.",3,3,5,21 September 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg's best film to date!
","I first saw this film in the movie theater. The beginning of the Normandy landing has not left my mind. It is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film. You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamati, one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role. This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance. SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time, the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened. You will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see. HE does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at it's best. I didn't care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home. I wanted Steven Spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about World War II even surpassing Schindler's List which I felt was inferior to this film. The script was superb, the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date. It still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level. he won the Oscar for best director but after seeing Shakespeare in Love, there is no doubt in my mind that Saving Private Ryan was robbed of Best Film. Sorry, Shakespeare in Love!",10,4,7,23 April 2006
The Pianist," Poland is no longer alone.
","Roman Polanski was a holocaust survivor. He directed perhaps the most important film about the period based on the true story of Wladislaw Szpilman, a Polish Jewish pianist, who survived on his own strength with the help of his friends and even a German soldier who helped him in the end. The film is based on the true story. They're were horrible events that actually happened in the Warsaw Ghetto. Warsaw today was built upon the ruins of World War II. Adrien Brody was well honored with an Academy Award. The supporting cast was excellent with Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman as his parents. Roman Polanski is the best person to direct a film about the Holocaust and even from his own experiences. This film is perhaps Polanski's best film and most personal of all.",10,0,0,20 July 2019

They have endured a lot together. Ralph Fiennes should have won an Oscar for his performance here. He did a terrific job. The lobby boy named Zero Mustafa also did a terrific job. Every performance is first rate here. The art direction, costumes, and makeup truly deserved their Academy Awards. The movie is just enjoyable all around with a wicked sense of humor all around. This is the kind of film that you enjoy watching repeatedly. It has a wonderful original score. Wes Anderson is best known for large cast and art direction.

Seabiscuit," Almost Perfect Film!
","I never thought that I would care about a movie about horse-racing. I saw this film by chance and I thought it was incredibly first rate and worthy of the Oscar nominations. Tobey McGuire is brilliant as is Jeff Bridges, the millionaire who loses his son in a car accident and his wife played by Valerie Mahoff in a divorce shortly later. The story about Seabiscuit is based on the true story about how America suffered through the Great Depression after the roaring 1920s. The film's art direction, costumes, and scenery is first rate. The narration by the wonderful David McCullough is somewhat appropriate but at times I felt that I was watching a documentary about the great depression which intrigued me more than the subject of horse-racing and how America survived the great depression. Tobey's character is an equestrian from a family who lost everything in the great depression. Before he would read Charles Dickens' classics with his parents and siblings at the dinner table, after the crash is where his parents made the ultimate sacrifice in leaving him with a man who owned a home and horse-racing.",8,0,2,10 May 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Ang Lee's Best Film to Date as of 2006
","First, I don't think it matters that there are subtitles and the language is Chinese. The story is strong and moves along smoothly. The fighting scenes are worth watching alone. The actors are choreographed to dance and fight with you just wanting to see who defeats. The story is also told with great costumes, art direction, and scenery. The stars of this film are Asian actors and actresses who don't get enough work in this business. While the subtitles might throw you off, it's not hard to understand what's going on by studying their actions, movements, and facial expressions. If Ang Lee had the actors talk in English throughout the film, I don't think it would have lost much value to me since I'm not Asian or Chinese or the audience. I believe that this is one of the best foreign language films of the last decade and it was awarded an Oscar for Foreign Language Film. Although I don't think Ang Lee cared about awards in making this film, this film has female characters who are both strong and equal to the male characters in the film. The females sometimes steal the scenes from the men. It's nice to see women portrayed as strong, equals than emotional inferior characters. They are equally adept at the fighting scenes and they give their all to those scenes. When you think of Ang Lee's other films, nothing could really master the beauty and uniqueness of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",10,10,16,8 January 2006
JFK," The Best Film of the Century
","There are very few films who can keep me watching over and over again. I just love this movie. I felt like a part of the story. It opened my mind and eyes to the obviousness of the crime. If you doubt the story, then you wouldn't enjoy it as much. It is so well executed with the film editing, the music sends chills down my spine, the acting ensemble i ncludes The finest American actors and actresses. Asner, Jack Lemmon, Costner, Spacek, Tommy Lee Jones, Pesci, Bacon, Laurie Metcalf, John Candy, Gary Oldman, and the list can go on and on. Do not forget Donald Sutherland's role as his main informant. The only problem is that the film is too short. It is still a brilliant piece of American Cinema. Never before did I feel like an American robbed of my King. Rest in Peace Jim Garrison and the others who sought the truth. We are still seeking the truth even now.",10,3,16,15 January 2001
Get Out," I want your eye, man. I want those things you see through.
","Jordan Peele wrote and directed this psychological thriller where he earned an Academy Award for original screenplay. Peele was blessed with an excellent cast like Catherine Keener and Bradford Whitford as Rose's parents. The other cast members were just as excellent in the their performances. Peele slowly introduces the audience into an interracial city couple. They go to the suburbs to visit Rose's parents. They all seem so happy to meet her African American boyfriend. It just seems too good to be true. Their employees, an African American housekeeper named Georgina and Walter who worked the grounds are just strange and off to Chris. The next day at the strangest party, we meet very eager middle aged caucasians and a very strange silent bingo game. Peele carefully reveals the secrets to the audience layer by layer. There is not that much gore and violence until the end. Peele was masterful at building the suspense, intrigue and dilemma. There were a few minor questions about the motives behind the secret. I don't want to spoil the plot. The film slowly builds to thrilling conclusion and that's what makes it a great thriller. Peele was careful about slowly building that with every scene and sentence. You just couldn't help yourself once you first start watching it. I enjoyed the performances from Whitford, Keener and Stephen Root as well. The actor who played the leading role deserved his nomination for best actor in the film.",9,2,7,24 May 2019
The Theory of Everything," Want Proof of God's Existence! Just Look at Stephen Hawking!
","Eddie Redmayne earned his Academy Award and also an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) for his services to drama. His performance of the great physicist Stephen Hawking CBE, CH, was captivating, believable, and executed with perfection. Redmayne has performed Hawking with sincerity, intelligence, and without pity. His performance is one of the year's best and perhaps the best in a long time. His character's illness slowly progresses his physical abilities but not his mental capacity. He is still a a genius and his survival defied the odds and life expectancy of only two years. He is now in his seventies and is active as ever. Despite his inabilities, he is still a brilliant genius but a human being with flaws as well. He became a husband, father, professor, author, and even speaker without his voice. The talking box conveys the only voice that most of the world is aware of Hawking. Despite his inability to speak due to a tracheotomy, he has still endured and survived. I don't know what qualifies for a miracle but Hawking is an example of one. He still is going strong. I also enjoyed the performances by Felicity Jones as his devoted wife Jane Wilde and Maxine Peake who played Elaine Mason, his nurse. Emily Watson also plays Jane's mother too. David Thewlis is remarkable as Hawking's mentor professor.",9,0,2,6 December 2015
The Lives of Others," Almost Perfect!
","I don't know German but this film really is incredible in terms of cinema. It's one of the films that deserved the Academy Award for foreign language. The cast does an incredible especially the male roles including the Captain who eavesdrops on the German playwright. He is torn between his country and doing the right thing. The film is surprising. Martina Gedeck is the best German actress alive in my opinion. She plays Christa with conviction and believability. Her character is the actress and playwright's lover. There is lot going on here since life under Communism was strictly under surveillance. Anything could get you locked up and imprisoned even the most innocent offenses. It's no wonder life under Communism was paranoid and frightening situation. It was all about control and lack of decision making. For anybody like myself whose parents were raised in Communist Poland, East Germany appeared to have everything under it's control much like George Orwell's novel, 1984. You don't want to be caught or even suspect under East German rule during this time. The film's almost perfect except I would like have seen a more solid ending.",9,1,1,13 June 2012
Schindler's List," Just about Flawless but Painful to watch!
","I have seen Schindler's List once and it is more than enough. This film can be too painful to watch at times. Even though my own family survived the war as Polish Catholics, they too still have scars to last more than a lifetime. My one problem with Steven Spielberg is that it's not graphic enough. The war was terrible and almost everybody in Poland was scarred as well. Schindler's List is a difficult film for adults to watch because it is graphic, brutal but all wars both graphic and brutal. Oskar Schindler wasn't so much hero or saint but he was a human being who did an incredible thing by saving thousands. There are others out there who did their part like Raoul Wallenberg. I have to say that if ,Holocaust survivor and Polish Jew, Roman Polanski directed this story to film, it might have been more brutal and graphic or maybe there would be more of a connection. I felt that Spielberg lacked that connection in this film.",10,9,13,15 April 2008
The Incredibles," A Superior Animated Film!
","Okay, Pixar and animation has a lot more going for it. Besides only needing human voices to make animated movies and television series, the top and first class animated figures are done by computers now than hand-done but it takes a village to make a great animated film. The Incredibles is about a superhero couple who retire to have a normal life as they can. Of course, Craig T. Nelson is wonderful and recognizable as the voice of the father and superhero who can't give up his former profession. His wife is the voice of norm here who wants a normal life for their family. I could see why this film and others have attracted audiences whether young and old, parents, grandparents, and children. Most audiences can relate to the situation and enjoy the Disney film and appreciate how technology has come along way.",9,1,1,7 June 2007
School of Rock," Rock and Roll Live Forever!
","I love Jack Black. YOu can have your Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, Jude Law, and any other hunk but I'll take Jack Black because he is not only funny but he appears normal like the rest of us. He rocks this film playing a guitarist who gets kicked out of his own band. Hard on his luck, he accepts a substitute teaching job for $650.00 per week under his roommate's name. Under pressure for not chipping into the rent, his roommate's girlfriend played beautifully by Kathy Silverman even in this small role does a great job. So he takes the substitute job with hopes that he will start a band again. Anyway, he discovers the band under his nose when he learns that the kids play musical instruments at a top notch private school where tuition is about $15,000 per year. Joan Cusack was perfectly cast as the school principal, uptight and disliked by the teachers. Of course, Jack Black's character and the students of ten year old wonder actors and actresses all have a part in the project of a rock band under the disguise of a competition. Anyway, everybody even know-it-all Summer has a part as band manager. The band has a role for everybody in the class. One student works the light while another works the security in hopes of keeping the principal away from the classroom secret. I love his role of teaching rock and roll history. I feel ancient now. Jack Black earned a Golden Globe Nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy Film and I think the honor is very well-deserved and I look forward to more of Jack Black.",9,1,2,4 December 2006
Amadeus," Breathtaking! Stunning! Worthy of Every Award!
","There are few films out there even today that can match Amadeus' incomparable genius. For starters, the two leading actors played by Oscar and Golden Globe Winner F. Murray Abraham and Oscar Nominee Tom Hulce play Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two rival composers. When Abraham speaks, you can't take your eyes off him whether he is elderly or young and promising and gifted as well. He saves his envy for the spoiled musical prodigy Mozart who is also goofy and childish as well. It's Salieri who begins to despise his rival without telling him the truth of how much he resented Mozart's musical genius and that God chose Mozart over Salieri. Anyway, the backdrop which includes the lavish costumes and art direction are unforgettable. The movie takes you to another place and time where the same occurrences of rivalries, jealousies, and envy can be a powerful weapon of hatred. Mozart naively believes in Salieri's friendship and support. I don't care for the casting of American actors like Jeffrey Jones playing the Austrian emperor. Cynthia Nixon playing the maid hired by Salieri to spy on the Mozart family. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was adequate as well as Christine Ebersole. British actors like Roy Dotrice (when will be honored) and Simon Callow CBE are equally the same. It really is Salieri's film overall told from his point of view. You can't forget Mozart's unique laugh and his desire for his father's love who wants him back in Salzburg than in Vienna. Salieri's father died while he was young. We don't see much of the women in the film but that is expected since you expect that women were still second class citizens. Salieri envied Mozart's genius as well as zest for life outside music. He loved parties and people while Salieri preferred music. Oh what a film for the ages!",10,2,4,3 November 2006
Coyote Ugly," From a True South Amboy Girl!
","I was born in Amboy, Perth Amboy, right across the river from South Amboy where the girl, Violet Sanford, was supposed to be from. I was there the day that the film came to town to shoot the opening scene. They all ordered pizza from the pizzeria, Delios, right across the street whose owners are truly Sicilian born and bred who have been making pizza since before I was born. I met some of the crew members. The filming only lasted a couple of days but I remember it like yesterday. South Amboy is not so far away from New York City that Violet could have made the trek on her own like the hundreds who do from the South Amboy train station which goes directly to Penn Station. I really became a fan of Piper while watching the film last night on television as well as Maria Bello who plays bar owner, Lil. My family are huge admirers of Melanie Lynskey mostly from her role as Rose on Two and Half Men but she's good here except she plays the accent just a little too thick. Nobody in South Amboy talks like that. You can't help but love John Goodman. Anyway the film's alright with a story of Violet Sanford who wishes to become a songwriter.",7,0,1,25 March 2007
Call Me by Your Name," When you least expect it, nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.
",The film is set in Northern Italy in 1983 before the AIDS crisis. The film is about a teenager named Elio Perlman who comes of age one summer. Oliver is his father's research assistant sent for a summer internship. Their romance slowly begins and unfolds during the film. Elio's parents must be the most enlightened parents ever. They even hint that they know about their son's sexuality before he tells them. They even send him and Oliver on a road trip together towards the end of the film. The romance is believable. The actors do their best to convey their attraction although somewhat discrete in Italy. Elio lives with his parents at a villa in Northern Italy year round. The summer flies by though as does the film. The film does have an abrupt ending about Oliver and Elio's relationship.,8,1,2,18 August 2018
The Hurt Locker," A Very Intense War Film!
","Kathryn Bigelow was the first woman to win an Academy Award for Best Director for this film. The film is s testament about war and how it affects soldiers and civilians too. This film stars Jeremy Renner as William James, a military professional who defuses bombs. Renner does a brilliant job in his performance. He gives a gut wrenching performance. The cast is a superb ensemble. Bigelow doesn't shy away from the horrors of war and brutality of it. Bigelow doesn't sugarcoat the life of war in Iraq. There are heart wrenching scenes like being unable to defuse a bomb to save a man's life or the loss of a friend and local DVD seller Beckham, a young boy. It is hard watching the images of children living in a war zone. Bigelow deserved the award for showing the cruel brutality of war. There are no winners in war but only losers on both sides.",10,1,2,24 October 2015
Moulin Rouge!," A Beautiful Visual Feast of Dance & Music!
","The cast all gave terrific performances about the Moulin Rouge nightclub in turn of the century Paris, France. Ewen MacGregor and Nicole Kidman play doomed lovers. Oscar winner Jim Broadbent ('Iris' supporting actor) and others supply strong performances. The music and dancing is wonderful along with the stunning art direction and costumes. Nicole Kidman won an Oscar for another film in the same year but she is marvelous here. The film was shot in Australia far away from the real Montmartre section of Paris, France. The songs are more familiar and modern despite the setting and time. This film could be adapted for a stage musical. The weakness in this film is with the storyline. I felt there was more attention to the songs and dancing than the script.",8,0,2,4 October 2015
Coco," To know Coco is to love Coco!
","This movie is a visual delight for the senses. The story of Miguel, a small town Mexican boy who aspires to play music. His family are shoemakers and music is banned in their home. Miguel wants to play music. Nothing could please Miguel if his family gives their blessing to him. When Miguel accidentally ends up in the land of the dead, he reunited with his deceased family members. Miguel goes on an unforgettable journey. The land of the dead is vibrant, colorful and alive. I'm not too crazy about the skeleton imagery though. Apart from the skeleton imagery, I did enjoy the film. The cast of voices are marvelous.",9,1,3,7 December 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Likable Animated Film!
","This family friendly film is about an inventor who creates a machine to distribute food instead of water around the world. When the machine gets out of control, the world could be destroyed by an abundance of food. I did enjoy the film's super animation with its realistic people and settings. The colorfulness in the environment is well received. Anna Faris plays a likable weather forecaster. Bill Hader plays the voice of the inventor. The story is unrealistic but the film does manage to pull it off. I found the film weakest in the storyline and character development. I rarely recognized the voices of notable actors and actresses in their characters. Their characters were developed and their voices weren't necessary needed by A-list actors and actresses. The only two voices that mattered were Hader and Faris who did a stunning job in their roles. Their characters weren't developed enough though and the film's storyline is overshadowed by its poor development. For a family film, it is enjoyable all around. The effects are just stunning and the visuals are brilliant with colors.",7,1,2,19 August 2015
Lincoln," Sir Daniel Day-Lewis' Well Deserved Third Academy Award!
","Sir Daniel Day Lewis was well awarded for playing sixteenth American President Abraham Lincoln. The film is based on Presidential Scholar Doris Kearns Goodwin's award winning novel, 'Team of Rivals.' Spielberg does a brilliant job in recreating history which is not always an easy task. Sally Field was a wise choice to play Mary Todd Lincoln. Sure they could have casted a younger actress but I'm glad that Sally got another chance at a third Oscar. The cast is a dream come true with great performances by everybody all around. The film is about recreating history particularly with the Emancipation Proclamation in abolishing slavery and ending a dark time in American history. The film can be slow at times while there is plenty of dialogue too.",8,2,4,19 July 2015
Million Dollar Baby," Reminds us of what is missing in films today!
","One of the reasons that I don't like going to the movies now is the violence and profanity that fills films rather than great meaningful dialogue. I knew the ending which is why I didn't want to see it. I didn't agree with it which is the only reason that I am giving it a 9. I found the relationship between Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank to be both beautiful, meaningful, and surprisingly platonic which is rare in movies today. There is too much focus on sexuality and this film lacks it completely. The relationship is more father and daughter than anything else. Clint's character Frankie Dunn finds a willing substitute in Hilary Swank's character, Maggie Fitzgerald. Her character recalls her father fondly in spoken memories only. She does not share the same fondness for her mother and other living relatives. Maggie follows her dream to box professionally which her mother disapproves. Maggie works hard, long hours of waitressing. She saves her pennies and even brings home scraps of leftover food. Hunger and poverty is never really talked about in films anyway. Maggie is a strong character who never gives up her dreams and she is loyal to her trainer, Frankie Dunn who learns to train her. The film's ending still leaves me asking more questions. I am not a person who cries easily and I had tears in my eyes. Morgan Freeman is also wonderful and deserved his Academy Award. In any other year, Clint would have won for Best Actor too and Hilary's performance is both heartbreaking and Oscar winning. She is the best actress of her generation with her own heartbreaking story. She always gives it her all in film and this is no exception.",9,3,4,22 August 2005
Garden State," A New Jersey State of Mind!
","Garden State is the state motto. Zach Braff was born, raised, and lived in South Orange, New Jersey which is home to celebrities like Kelly Bishop and Andre Braugher. South Orange is an upscale suburb of New York City and neighboring Newark, New Jersey. Zach Braff is perfect as the director, writer, and leading actor in this film which I heard about when he hosted Saturday Night Live. His loving homage to his home state makes you wonder what really goes on in New Jersey. There are multiple sides to life in New Jersey. I just couldn't believe that he got the wonderful Sir Ian Holm to play his father. Natalie Portman is truly believable as the girl of his dreams. Jean Smart is unforgettable as Carol, one of his friend's unconventional mothers. Life in New Jersey varies from the very rich to the very poor, rural, suburban, and urban. His story begins with a phone call from his father informing him that his invalid mother drowned in the bathtub. He returns home to New Jersey for the funeral and reunites with old friends. His character is an aspiring Hollywood heterosexual actor who works as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant until he gets another acting job. In Hollywood, he's one of thousands aspiring actors out there. I love how he compares Natalie's family to his own.",9,0,1,26 May 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Suspenseful, Intriguing! What movies should be about!
","This film is not for children or squeamish adults. This film has shocking moments like Lisbeth's relationship with her appointed guardian for instance. I won't spoil the circumstances but it's worth noticing Lisbeth's sense of justice throughout the film. Without knowing it, she is following Michael Blomquist, a disgraced journalist with prison time for libel. Anyway, he has six months so he takes a leave and is hired to find out about the disappearance of Harriet Vanger. The Vanger family is one of the wealthiest in the country but they have their share of secrets. Anyway, the story slowly unravels at a decent pace. I haven't read the books but I was interested in seeing the Swedish film over the American version of the same story. Maybe it's because I think Sweden has a great cast in this film. The actress who plays Lisbeth Salander is fantastic in this role. She was plays Lisbeth in the trilogy. I can't wait to see those films.",10,6,8,19 January 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The Best Film of the Year!
","I am amazed that this film does not get the same attention at Brokeback MOuntain. It is simply an incredible achievement for director George Clooney. My biggest complaint is that it is too short. There is so much going on during that time. I am reminded of how the news changed since the days of Edwin R. Murrow. I am reminded of how much I dislike my local and national news. There is too much softness regarding on reporting abroad. Major international news stories go unnoticed anyway. Maybe our society has become content to worry about our own problems. Murrow was an unsung hero of his time. He went against McCarthy who orchestrated a mass witch hunt unprecedented in American history since the Salem witch trials. I don't care for our news system today. It has become a sad commentary. This is a first rate cast with David Straitharn sure to earn a Best Actor NOmination at the Oscars. I would like George Clooney to get one for director. This film is a triumph over controversial yet an important time in American history. We must not forget the communism witch hunt of the 1950s. Today, there is another kind of witch hunt going on. I don't care about other films. Nothing has made a strong impression on me this year but this film. I left wanting more of it. The black and white cinematography added a film noir to it. It could have been done in color but not as effective. Bravo, George Clooney. Your Aunt Rosemary would be so proud of your achievement.",10,2,4,13 December 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Another Burton & Depp Film!
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have worked together before in other films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. In this film, Depp plays the strange Willy Wonka who has perfect teeth and a strange personality. We learn in this film about his dentist father played by Christopher Lee CBE (he should be Sir Christoper Lee) but that's another story. Poor Willy Wonka who wear a head brace to make his teeth perfect. He puts five chocolate bars with gold certificates. The lucky winners include the obese and slob, German Augustus, the spoiled rotten Veruca and her father played by James Fox, another great British actor, the blue girl from Georgia who is a champion like her mother, the troubled boy, and Charlie Bucket and his grandpa Jones. Charlie is poor and it is obvious that his family is struggling. Helen Bonham Carter's teeth are as poor as Willy's is white and perfect. The Buckets live in a shack with other notable British actors and actresses like the great Liz Smith who is not a gossip columnist in New York City but one of Britain's most under-rated and gifted comedic actresses in her eighties and going strong. She should also be on the honors list.",7,0,1,11 February 2008
The Insider," Truth is Stranger Than Fiction!
","60 Minutes is one of our finest television hours today. It has been around since the late sixties and has become a fixture on Sunday nights. As it gets older, it gets better. If you are not a fan of 60 Minutes, you might be after this film. It's one of the most incredible news hours on television. I always watch the show on Sunday nights. Anyway, this film is inspired by the actual events that brought a segment to life despite the possible devastation and possible ruin of CBS and 60 Minutes. Russell Crowe played Dr. Jeffrey Wigrand, a tobacco industry scientist, who gets fired and realized his industry's lies. Somehow Pacino played Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer, who gets the story with Wigrand's interview which could shatter the tobacco industry's image as ignorant about the effects of smoking. Well, I think this film belongs to Pacino because he's brilliant in the role. Crowe does a brilliant performance as Wigrand, torn between his family and the truth. Christopher Plummer should have gotten an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Mike Wallace. There are not many actors who could have pulled off Mike Wallace but Plummer does a brilliant job that was ignored at Oscar time. Still the cast is brilliant with Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife; Debi Mazar as his assistant; Diane Venora as Mrs. Wigrand.",10,1,1,17 January 2010
Into the Wild," An Almost Perfect Film!
","The great American actor, Hal Holbrook, was rightfully nominated for an actor in a supporting role in the film for his performance. The rest of the cast is first rate and Oscar winners include William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden. If you like Kristin Stewart, she does a very good job here as well. The cast is first rate and the writing is as well. The film's structure has a lot of flashbacks to the past of Christopher Candleless's life at home in West Virginia; his journey in America; and his time in Alaska. The actor, Emilie Hirsch, did an excellent job in playing the main character who seeks meaning in life without connection to society. In the film, we see what caused him to become the man he was and why he yearned a sense of freedom from money, family, and people in general. I haven't read the book but it's based on a true story about this remarkable young man who donated his life savings to charity and took off to see the country. The ending could have been better though with a follow-up on the other characters. Still, Jena Malone's narration and informative background history help us understand Chris's plight with life and his search for meaning like a modern day Thoreau or Ralph Waldo Emerson.",9,0,2,29 March 2012
Annie Hall," One of Woody's best!
","Okay, Woody Allen could be annoying sometimes and is heavily neurotic even in this film which he wrote and directed. The film is somewhat autobiographical about his relationships with a WASP woman named Annie Hall played by Diane Keaton in her Oscar winning role. Woody plays himself in the film even with a different name. Even though it's a short film, the story moves quickly and you have to be alert for some of the humor about the relationship between men and women. The supporting cast includes Tony Roberts, Paul Simon, Carol Kane and others. Woody's hatred of Los Angeles and all things Californian is well-known and documented. He is out of touch when he is away from New York City where he is equally neurotic. As a couple at first, Woody and Annie get along great but slowly Woody's own negativity creeps into the relationship. Annie starts seeing a therapist and their relationship unravels. When Annie's promising career as a cabaret singer rises, Woody becomes threatened and goes to Los Angeles to bring her back.",8,8,13,10 October 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
",I first tried to watch this film on a long flight from Hong Kong to London but I never saw the middle. The film is beautifully short by Stanley Kubrick and crew. He was definitely a master in beautiful colors and scenes. My problems with the film is the lack of storyline. The movie seems endless at times with the lack of storyline and the pacing of it. I know it's a masterpiece by film standards. The shots and visuals are enough to make me watch it again just not so soon. Kubrick was one of my favorite film directors who wasn't afraid to take risks and challenges. Keir Dullea was fabulous in the movie though. I believe the film needs to be on the big screen to be fully appreciated for its glory.,8,0,0,1 March 2018
Men in Black," It Worked Well because of Fiorentino!
","I have been a fan of hers since I saw her in Dogma. Now I wonder why I never noticed her before. Here she teams up with Oscar Winner Tommy Lee Jones and Oscar Nominee Will Smith as government agents to stop aliens from ruining our planet. First, the film is quite smart, witty, and works well. My favorite scenes are with Linda though not because I'm a fan of hers but she really steals the thunder and knows how to make a comeback whether verbal or physical. I don't know what happened on the set to make her the pariah of the film but she did deserve to return for the sequel. But for whatever reasons whether it was fate or her destiny, she was not and her performance in this film really shows that she can play Dr. Laurel Weaver as a smart, sensual, sexual, intelligent woman. We need more women like that and more actresses like that. She's approaching fifty now and it's not hard to believe that she wasn't even forty but she knows how to be equal with Smith and Jones. The problem might have been that it said men in black and not woman in black. I wish the best for Linda though where ever she is.",7,0,0,11 March 2007
The Graduate," Unforgettable!
","I still remember the way that the camera had focused on Bancroft's legs as she was putting on pantyhose or stockings as Ben Braddock played by a younger Dustin Hoffman was talking to her. The odd couple of mature, sensual, Mrs. Robinson and the college graduate, Benjamin Braddock. Who could forget the first time that Mrs. Robinson was completely naked and offered her assistance in helping Ben with sexual liberation. Of course, the two get together at hotels. It isn't until Mrs. Robinson's daughter played by the beautiful Katharine Ross comes into the picture and Ben falls for her just as she had for him. Sadly, Mrs. Robinson is not amused with the romance and losing Ben to her own daughter. It sounds like an episode of Jerry Springer just not in a trailer park but in a lovely Southern Californian development. The rest of the cast is magnificent featuring William Daniels, Murray Hamilton, Alice Ghostley, Buck Henry, Elizabeth Wilson, and others. It's a great film!",10,1,2,12 May 2007
Singin' in the Rain," Lina. She can't act, she can't sing, she can't dance. A triple threat.
","I haven't seen Singin in the Rain but it's a great film. It has a sense of humor with a terrific cast like Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly. It's become a timeless classic. Now I know why Debbie sang 'Good Mornin' on Will & Grace upon arrival. She broke out as Cathy Selden, an aspiring actress who can sing, dance and act. The film is colorful, musical and full of beauty. Less than two hours long, the film did a terrific job in the editing room. My biggest upset was how the film turned out for Lina. I felt her humiliation was uncalled for at the end by exposing that Cathy was the voice behind the squeaky actress. Apart from that moment, the film is perfection.",9,1,1,15 March 2020
This Is Spinal Tap," I've waited 20 years to see it and now I know why Jamie fell in love with Guest!
","There's nothing about this film that you probably have not heard. It is the film that introduced the young Barron Christopher Guest to his future wife, Jamie Lee Curtis. They are one of today's most successful and happy couples in Los Angeles. While Jamie lee has never been directed by her husband, Christopher Guest must be one of the shyest geniuses in Hollywood today. He has never casted his famous wife or equally famous in-laws (Janet Leigh or Tony Curtis). I thought he directed this film. He did not but Rob Reiner who plays in it too. I have seen most of Christopher Guest films like Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, and I just adore his directing style. He has the same group of talented actors like Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, JEnnifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, EUgene Levy, etc. This film shows the beginning of his genius as well. It is written by the stars and not some nameless screenwriters. In fact, actors and actresses so adore working with Guest as a director that they are always returning to work with him again and again. He should be recognized for his wittiness and unique brand of humor that he has wonderfully given us. Too bad he is happily married.",9,0,4,22 April 2006
Chariots of Fire," Still a wonderful film!
","I loved the soundtrack to this film and I was glad to watch it on Oscar Sunday. It is worthy of its' Oscars and is based on a true story. The music can be haunting and beautiful at the same time. Vangelis is a musical genius. The cast is stellar with some new faces of actors and actresses like Alice Krige and even Ruby Wax if you look closely. The 1924 Olympics is the climax of the film. It's still a beautiful and wonderfully entertaining and educational film to be seen. I loved the cast including Sir Ian Holm, Sir John Gielgud, and the young aspiring Olympic athletes including Brad Davis, Ian Charleson, and Ben Cross. The story is beautifully told in writing and the direction is brilliant to convey the beauty of the story. This is a feel good classic film from 1981.",10,30,42,2 March 2004
The Artist," Uggie Still Rules The Film!
","This film was more silent and black and white unlike today's films. This film paid tribute to Hollywood's early silent years. Jean Dejardin, a French actor, plays George Valentin, a silent film star in the twenties. French Berenice Bejo plays Peppy Miller, an up and coming starlet. George and Peppy's romance rules the film. The French leads have a great supporting cast. The film's biggest star is actually the dog named Uggie. George takes his dog everywhere. The film was beautifully done and worth watching. You find something new every time. This film depicts early Hollywood. I love George and Peppy in the film. I also enjoyed seeing John Goodman, James Cromwell, Missi Pyle, Penelope Ann Miller and even Malcolm McDowell.",10,1,6,29 September 2015
Mission: Impossible," The movie is not impossible to understand!
","Granted, I heard terrible things about this film before I saw it on video. After watching this film several times, I got the plot but I also get a little more each time. I love watching Dame Vanessa Redgrave as a female criminal mastermind in this role. I also enjoyed a bit known actor, Rolf Saxon, an American expatriate living in London, as William Donloe. Remember he's the poor sucker that gets the blame for a breaking an entry that caught him off guard. I like Rolf Saxon as the gullible American in this film. He's the best part of the film in my opinion and the surprise to me since I became a fan of his in 1994 after watching old Capital City episodes. I believe did his job extremely well and deserved to be listed in both beginning and ending credits of the film. I love John Voight and can't imagine why Angelina Jolie doesn't want much to do with him. I felt Tom Cruise was adequate. I like Vingt Rhames and Henry Czerny in the their roles. I forget the French actress who was Voight's wife. That's too crazy to believe. I thought that Kristin Scott-Thomas and Emilio Estevez deserved more time on screen but that's the movie for you. I loved the Prague setting, Virginia countryside, and London as well.",10,1,3,7 October 2005
Life Is Beautiful," life is beautiful
","This is a a great film and a beautiful love story between man and woman forgotten over recent film-making. Bellini shows a difficult story with humor and grace that even most people can relate too. When Guido finally gets his princess, their happiness is disturbed by the concentration camps and the Holocaust. Even Bellini brings necessary humor to comfort his only son from the evil of war. It's a heart-breaking film with Roberto playing the main character, his real-life wife plays his wife on screen in this film and often in others as his love interest. The little boy who plays his son is also wonderful. The film itself is a visual beauty to watch at first. It makes you want to pack up and head to Rome.",10,1,3,19 February 2002
A Clockwork Orange," What Kubrick does best?
","I have only seen this film once and yet I probably will watch it again. It's kind of painful to watch sometimes especially those scenes in the prison. Malcolm McDowell should be knighted by now. His role of Alex, the criminal, becomes a three dimensional character rather than just a caricature. Of course, the late great Stanley Kubrick provides spectacular images and scenes with color and unforgettable music. The movie shows a futuristic society in which the criminal like Alex can be cured but mostly by some of the most inhumane motives. I don't approve of Alex's crimes but I don't think cruel punishment is the way to redeem and cure the hard criminal. Because once he goes on the outside, he reunites with some of his victims. They return the crime. So crime begets crime, victim becomes criminal and the reformed criminal like Alex becomes a victim of society. This film ponders the questions about curing criminals. By making him a victim of crime, he becomes the victim. The sad truth is that it does not work. Criminals like Alex need psychotherapy, drugs, and something more than watching Nazi films about abuse. BUt I'll definitely watch this film again. With Kubrick, you can never get enough, boy do I miss him.",10,1,4,19 January 2006

The movie begins with the wonderful Christopher Plummer (one of today's finest actors on stage, film or television) as his grandfather and Oscar winner Jon Voight as his father. Gates believes that there is a conspiracy to steal the original declaration of independence from Washington D.C. by thieves who seek the treasure. He decides to take it before they do. They are hot on his trail and he takes a female love interest and antique document restorer along for the ride with a trusty male sidekick. They uncover one clue which leads to another.

Reservoir Dogs," Stuck in the Middle with You. Clowns to the Left of Me. Jokers to the Right of Me!
","The first minutes of the film is about a breakfast and lunch before the eight men dressed suspiciously go out for a job in a jewelry heist. I don't know about you but if I saw that group of men, I would call the cops right away. Since we don't get to see what happened in the jewelry store, it was mayhem and carnage. We don't really know what happened during the jewelry heist. Although I can only imagine the horror of it all, they return to the warehouse where the men under aliases are wondering who the cop is in the group. The audience learns before the end. I don't get the film's appeal though. I have seen it twice. Except for the conversation at the restaurant, we don't see any other female roles in the cast.

","It's hard to be an artist, both talented and in turmoil by inner demons like David Helfgott. Geoffrey Rush deserved his Oscar for this role. He truly brings the character alive and well to the audiences. Lynn Redgrave deserved a supporting actress nomination for her performance as the woman who would turn out to be the love of David's life. Googie Withers, one of Australia's best known actresses, played beloved Catherine, his mentor and financier in David's younger years. John Gielgud has a brief but memorable performance. I like the fact that they filmed this film in both Australia and England. This film really examines mental illness and how David triumphs over the odds. He was down and out and forgotten. Somehow when you hear his music, you remember how much he triumphed over the odds. Despite his mental breakdown at what would have been the beginning of an extraordinary career, he was down but not out. He had to recover and slowly work his way back to the living. When David plays music, he becomes alive and genius to us. Many people have been where David has been and are still going through the pains of life. This movie is an inspiration for all of us, artists-writer, performers, painters to get up and rise again. When he returns to play live in a small Perth bar, you get chills down your spine. It's a great kind of film and you wish to be in Perth, Australia.",10,2,3,2 March 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," More Questions than Answers but we miss Kubrick!
","I was a bit disappointed because I felt that I still need to know more about the party. I wanted to shake Sydney Pollack's character and asked him more questions. Why was he there? How do you join? Is it a secret club? What was the purpose of the red caped man? All I could think of was that the red caped man was a leader of a satanic cult. The music and the chanting of the words. Now if this was some kind of party, why did they have such creepy music and chanting. Then some of the masked guests or participants removed their capes, the women were beautiful but practically naked with only their masks and bikini bottoms. Then they all started touching each other as the music and chanting continued. Once they were done, they went off with the other cloaked men. We saw scenes of debauchery (I hope I use it properly) at this mysterious mansion. Naked women mostly and few naked men engage in sordid lovemaking. Of course, Pollack's character only hinted that the masks were protect the identities of the rich and powerful at these parties. No matter what, what was a prostitute doing there? When one woman risks herself to save Tom's character, we are expected to believe it was all an act. Come on, I can't believe that Tom's character was just playing a role in dark play. I'm sorry but I have so many questions about the house, the party, and the participants which left me kind of disappointed. While I love Kubrick, the film is worth watching but not for children or for the squeamish. We miss you Kubrick, wherever you are.",10,5,10,16 January 2006
Some Like It Hot," Monroe, Lemmon, and Tony Curtis! What more could you ask for?
","I haven't seen this film until this past weekend. I know it has been highly rated as an all time classic comedy and I can see why. I love Tony CUrtis and Jack Lemmon as two male band players forced to dress up as women in order to get out of CHicago after the Valentine's Day massacre in 1929. Tony Curtis deserves a lot of credit for playing the male suitor to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar. Even though Jack Lemmon is hysterical as Daphne, you can't forget how giddy and happy he is when he finds love with a male suitor played wonderfully by Joe E. Brown. I forget who plays the female conductor but she's also wonderful in the film. It's sad that Marilyn Monroe died so young only three years after making this wonderful classic film. She and Tony Curtis appear made for each other in this film. Jack Lemmon was well deserved of his Oscar nomination but I can't imagine why they left out Tony Curtis. Billy Wilder chose wisely to film it in black and white. I love the train ride scenes and once they are down in Florida. I love and miss both Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe. I wish Tony Curtis would talk about it on the Actors Studio since he is still very much alive and well.",10,0,0,21 February 2006
Pulp Fiction," First Rate Cast but silly plot!
","I don't get this film and why it's so great according to Siskel and Ebert or other critics. Maybe it's the style of filming that is both experimental and groundbreaking, all I found was that there was so much cursing and swearing and a weak plot. I love the scene where John Travolta dances with Uma Thurman. It's silly but memorable, probably the most memorable scene from the film. I think the film is disappointing because I preferred the spoofs from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV versions. This film is completely about life in Los Angeles. I liked the interaction between the two hit men played by Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's characters. It seemed to be real. I don't understand the diner experience. I thought it was out of place. I think I have to watch it again and again to finally get it.",8,0,2,20 November 2006
The Disaster Artist," We're actors, Greg. For you, me, people like us, even the worst day on a movie set is better than the best day doing anything else.
","I was surprised to Jacki Weaver in this film but she was brilliant playing Carolyn/Claudette in this film. James Franco would have definitely been a front-runner for an Academy Award for Best Actor. He directed, produced and acted as Tommy Wiseau, an aspiring actor from unknown background. Greg Sestero befriends him in San Francisco and they go South to Los Angeles, California. Tommy's background is a mystery even to Greg. The film is based on the actual room, 'The Room,' which became a cult hit. Tommy Wiseau is not an easy character but James Franco brings out the best and worst in him that you actually feel sorry for this man. Granted, Tommy's behavior on the set is quite troubling. He can be abusive and unforgiving. While 'The Room' was never an Academy Award quality style film, Tommy and Greg set to make out a film which became a cult classic around the world. That is quite an accomplishment. I have to see 'The Room' now though. The film celebrates film-making from the ultimate outsiders like Tommy and Greg who proved that they can break through.",10,2,2,2 July 2018
Mystic River," Chilling, Cringe Worthy Tale!
","The film is about the relationships among three men from childhood after one of them is abducted by two men and kept a prisoner for four days in the woods. The beginning scene where he gets in the car made me cringe. Thankfully, we never see the abuse but we know with it being just as horrifying. Decades later, the men like Jimmy runs a neighborhood deli; Sean does homicide cases for the state; and Dave is battling his demons from childhood when he was abducted and tortured by two grown middle aged men. Sean and Jimmy feel guilt and pain about the time Dave was taken away. When Jimmy's 19 year old daughter, Katie, is found murdered, we see an Oscar winning performance by Sean Penn. Dave is played by Tim Robbins in an equally moving Oscar winning performance in the supporting actor category. Marcia Gay Harden earned her second Oscar nomination for supporting actress for playing Dave's long suffering wife. The end of the film has some twists and turns. Sometimes, karma takes place. Jimmy is not always the family man and has his own secrets. I wondered about Kate's funeral scene. Laura Linney does a fine job playing Jimmy's second wife. The film was directed by legendary Clint Eastwood on location in Boston. The supporting cast is excellent particularly Jenny O'Hara as Estelle Harris and Susan Willis who played Mrs. Prior. Emmy Rossum does a memorable turn as Katie Markum. Kevin Chapman is memorable as one of the Savage brothers. Laurence Fishburne was great as Sean's police partner in investigating Katie's homicide.",9,4,7,23 April 2013
It's a Wonderful Life," Simply Perfect!
","It's A Wonderful Life is about George Bailey played beautifully by the late great actor, Jimmy Stewart. It's directed by Frank Capra and it's an impressive film overall. Donna Reed plays his loving wife and the mother of his children. Who could forget his guardian angel, Clarence? and the wonderful people who make Bedford Falls, New York. The film is long but it's worth watching. Before NBC bought it, it used to be shown repeatedly around the holiday season. There was never a day without It's A Wonderful Life! Still almost every show from Married with Children to Saturday Night Live has used the story line of what it would be like if George was never born. He learns at the end that he had a wonderful life and it sends chills down your spine and tears to your eyes. It's the kind of film that you don't forget or want too. It makes us all feel important.",10,1,5,26 December 2006
A Beautiful Mind," A Princeton State of Mind!
","The cost of brilliance might be madness. You don't need to look further than the brilliant math genius John Nash played here by Oscar Winner Russell Crowe. He should have won another Academy Award for Best Actor in this role. It's not easy at Princeton University. They probably didn't flinch an eyeball in their ivy digs over the Oscars. It's the kind of university where it takes a whole lot to impress those ivy geniuses. After all, they have Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison, author Joyce Carol Oates, and Nobel prize winners on their faculty as well. Ron Howard said he loved filming in Princeton, New Jersey which doesn't seem to fit in the rest of stereotypical New Jersey. It's like another world of it's own where geniuses discuss politics, history, economics, math, and literature. It's hardly believable that some of them probably don't own television sets because they think it's waste of time and a distraction but they probably have computers instead. Princeton is a state of mind and a place where the mind is valued more than the body. With brilliance comes madness for John Nash. Ron Howard creates a beautiful film based on John Nash's story of suffering and demons that battles his mind for control. I like the casting of Judd Hirsch and Jennifer Connolly as the loving, devoted wife. John Nash will be remembered for this film more than his brilliance but that he was human just like the rest of us.",10,0,2,19 February 2007
The Departed," Not Quite About Whitey Bulger!
","Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed' is a terrific entertaining film despite the violence, profanity and some sexuality. Jack Nicholson gave one of his best performances as Frank Costello, a Boston mobster. Instead of Italian mobsters in New York City, it is Boston and Irish mafia. Leonardo DiCaprio plays an undercover cop in Costello's mob. Matt Damon plays cop and his mole. The two men don't know who is playing who. The film features great supporting performances by Ray Winstone, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlburg, Vera Farmiga. The film storyline is gripping to watch and can't help to see how it ends. Martin Scorsese did a fabulous job in recreating the Boston mob. The film was shot on location in Boston. Scorsese and his brilliant film editor did a terrific job. Damon and DiCaprio gave terrific acting performances as two men driven to get and or help Costello. In the end, there are just too many departed after all the violence.",10,1,3,15 October 2015
Psycho," A boy's best friend is his mother.
","Lock your bathroom doors when you take a shower. This chilling horror classic by the master of horror, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, is probably his finest film. The cast is stellar featuring the unforgettable Janet Leigh in her Oscar nominated role as Marion Crane who steals 40 thousand dollars and takes to the road. She ends up at the Bates Motel operated by Norman Bates played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. The rest of the cast is first rate like the wonderful Vera Miles as Lila Crane, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam as the private investigator. I believe the actor who Sam, Marion's cash-strapped lover, is also quite good in the role. Frank Albertson and Lurene Tuttle and Pat Hitchcock also round out a supporting cast. I won't spoil the plot but the classic should not be tampered with as it is simply one of the best thrillers ever made.",10,5,9,11 November 2007
Rosemary's Baby," Chilling, frightening and yet a must see!
","Rosemary's Baby is one of the most controversial films of our time. I can't stop thinking about how sweet and nice Ruth Gordon was in her Academy award winning role. I loved her as Minnie even though she proved that even appearances can be truly deceiving. Who would ever thought that you lived next door to Satanists in New YOrk City. I felt sorry for Mia Farrow's character, Rosemary, but she does give the performance of her career. The haircut by Vidal Sassoon has been etched in my memory since I saw it on television. THe conception of her baby was hard to swallow and not for the squeamish like myself. John Cassavetes also gives a memorable, unforgettable performance as her husband willing to sell his wife out for a successful acting career. You never really like the character because of his immoral actions. As Rosemary comes closer to the truth, we are equally horrified by her discovery of her husband's new allegiance and the satanists who look so ordinary like Aunt Bee from the Andy Griffith Show. You never see them as anything but ordinary and that proves that the nicest, kindest neighbors can fool you. Ruth Gordon's performance as Minnie is well chilling. I won't give away the ending but I bet everybody knows it. A Satanist was consulted on the film and he was connected to Charles Manson whose gang murdered the director's wife. It's more horrifying than the film itself. While I get goosebumps about this story, it won't just leave you. You will always wondered what happened to that baby. Polanski who survived the holocaust as a child always knows how to remind you that people even the sweetest looking people in the world can be evil too.",10,3,4,16 December 2005
Zero Dark Thirty," Based on Actual Events!
","Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow has delivered a great dramatic film. Based on actual events, the film shows the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. Jessica Chastain is a perfect choice for Maya. Chastain is a brilliant actress and worth watching for. She reminds me of a young Katharine Hepburn with red hair. Bigelow does a great job in building for an exciting climax. I felt the ending was abrupt like what happened to everybody. The film can be slow at times especially the first hour. The film recreated the compound true to the actual one. I watched the film in French but understood it without subtitles. The supporting cast are first rate with James Gandolfini as the CIA director. Chastain's Maya is relentless and determined to find and kill Bin Laden known as UBL. It is nice to see a female character like Maya in a very masculine film. Jennifer Ehle plays Jessica, a fellow CIA agent. Maya and Jessica are strong, intelligent females equaled to their male agents. It is nice to see women not portrayed as vulnerable, weak and incomplete without a man and baby in their lives. The film is as truthful and faithful to the story.",8,0,1,12 August 2015
Love Actually," When I was young and successful, I was greedy and foolish, and now I'm left with no one. Wrinkled and alone.
","A great all star cast and writing is fused together with this Christmas holiday movie. The director and writer, Richard Curtis, did a terrific job. It begins in an airport and ends there. The cast included the wonderful Alan Rickman; Dame Emma Thompson; Colin Firth CBE; Rowan Atkinson CBE; Hugh Grant; Laura Linney; Liam Neesam OBE; Martine McCutcheon; Bill Nighy; Billy Bob Thornton and more. A young boy falls in love after his mother has died during Christmastime. We don't even see Anne Reid and Frances De La Tour at all due to the edits. The film director could have made two movies. Alan Rickman and Thompson played a long term married couple. Laura Linney's character is an American woman living and working in London, England with a mentally ill brother. I wished she had a happier ending in her life. The film is heartwarming tale of life and love in London, England when you wanted to live there. Bill Nighy was great as an aging rock star. Atkinson has two scenes pivotal to the plot. There were just so many story lines going on that could have edited in writing first hand. Still it's a happy film overall.",9,1,3,14 January 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," Please Don't Remake This Film!
","Harper Lee created a classic in her novel. This film adaptation is probably the best novel to film ever. It stars Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch in his Oscar winning role. Mary Badham plays the unforgettable Scout. One of the main reasons that I purchased the film was to see Ruth White in her performance as miserable Mrs. Dubose. Sadly she had a much bigger role in the novel but for everybody involved in this film classic, it was worth any minute of time. Alice Ghostley is also in the film as one of the mother and neighbor. Rosemary Murphy plays Maudie Atkinson. The film is first rate and classic which should never be remade even for today's audiences. It stands on it's own much Godfather and Citizen Kane. Please don't remake this film with today's stars.",10,4,6,23 February 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Now I know why they closed?
","This film is a brutal commentary and observation about mental health services in the United States. Many of these facilities have since closed. Many of these patients would be homeless on the streets. I only saw bits and pieces of the film in the past. Finally to see it altogether, Jack Nicholson is perfect as McMurphy. Nurse Ratched is well played by Louise Fletcher. Nurse Ratched is seen as the villain and labeled one of film history's villains. I don't see Nurse Ratched that way though. I don't know her enough. I believe she is doing her job which is difficult heading a psychiatric ward. I guess we see her coldness and true nature at the end when she discovers Bill's indiscretion. She uses it against him cruelly which leads him to tragedy. But I still don't think Nurse Ratched is this monster.",9,3,4,9 July 2014
Whiplash," For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune. You were, Erickson, but he didn't know and that's bad enough.
","SPOILER: J.K. Simmons richly deserved his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing Terence Fletcher, a jazz teacher at a prestigious music conservatory called Shaffer in New York City. When Andrew Neiman, a promising drum player, joins the studio band for competitions. He is pressured by his teacher to perform for excellence. Terence Fletcher is one of those teachers who can inspire and terrify you all at once. He is also abusive to his band of students. His relationship with Andrew is quite complex. The film is quite dark sometimes with lighting and scenery. Andrew goes to great lengths to arrive at a competition. The film is about Andrew proving himself to Fletcher as a musician and seeking his approval.",9,1,1,23 May 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," I'll give this little cookie an hour before we're doing the no-pants dance. Time to musk up.
","A great cast works this script about life in the seventies where sexism and misogyny were still in the network news. The location is San Diego, California where Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) has to share his anchor role with a woman (Christina Applegate). Ron is not the brightest bulb in the bunch. He makes serious errors which lead to his firing. The cast is first rate with Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell and others who even make cameos. It's a fun film overall despite some of the vulgarity and profanity but still worthwhile.",9,1,1,8 July 2019
The Green Mile," Your view of Death Penalty will change from watching this movie!
","Despite the difficult subject of death row, Stephen King's Green Mile is a story about death row inmates and the men who guard and will execute them in the end. The cast is excellent with Tom Hanks always turning in an Academy Award winning performance as the head guard. I never imagined the Bosom buddy could be brutal. He is surrounded by very accomplished actors and actresses-Bonnie Hunt plays his wife and Patricia Clarkson plays the ill-stricken wife of James Cromwell's character. I enjoyed watching professional actors like James Cromwell, Harry Dean Stanton and William Morse turn in excellent performances all around. I have to say that I was saddened by Michael Jeter's finest performance in the movie before his own death by AIDS. Of course, the main reason I watched was for Doug Hutchison who now plays Sebastian Hulce on Guiding Light, my favorite soap. As wonderful as he was in The Green Mile, he is better as Sebastian. I found his performance to be a breakthrough performance for somebody. But it is Michael Clarke Duncan who truly earned his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor that was really inspiring to watch. If you ever had a definite view of the death penalty, this film will change your mind about the barbarism and cruelty not on the death row inmates but on the guards themselves. I probably won't watch this film again. I get too emotionally involved. I am glad that the electric chair is not used like it used to be. It is rarely used nowadays. It is replaced by lethal injection. But now I wonder about the guards who befriend and form relationships with their prisoners whether they liked it or not. Now I wonder what happens to the guards after they become executioners themselves? You wonder what makes them different from the criminals!",10,0,1,21 February 2005
Jaws," My Favorite Spielberg Film of All Time
","I love Jaws and I still go in the ocean even though I've seen this movie about a hundred times. I love watching JAWs. It's probably Spielberg's best film to date, sorry Schindler's List, E.T., and Saving Private Ryan. This movie does not leave you with any bad feelings. The movie is first entertaining from beginning to end and it is well-done. I love Roy Scheider in his role as the water phobic police chief, Lorraine Gary as his wife, Murray Hamilton who I always mistake for Hal Holbrook as the Mayor of Amity, Robert Shaw as the shark hunter, and Richard Dreyfuss as the shark expert. Anyway, there are great moments in the film like when Chief Brody catches his young son imitating him at the dining room table and asks him for kiss and Mrs. Brody watching with a cup in hand. It's those moments of pure magic that make you want to watch over and over again.",10,1,2,31 October 2001
The Wrestler," Mickey Rourke the Wrestler both make comebacks!
","Who would have thought that washed up and notorious Mickey Rourke would be the front-runner for an Academy Award for playing Randy Ram Robinson, a veteran professional wrestler and celebrity in the wrestling entertainment world. First, I am not a wrestling fan in the least and this film shows the bruises, damage, and the non glorious side of the sport. Rourke is beautiful as the bruised, damaged self-proclaimed 'piece of meat.' The beginning of the film shows him as the washed up Ram after an appearance and his life where he lives alone in a trailer park where he hasn't paid his rent. He works days at the Acme supermarket and nights where he goes to a strip club and befriends Cassidy played by Marisa Tomei. If people thought her first Oscar win was a shock, she should get her second Academy Award for this performance as the stripper and single mom who wins Ram's heart. Ram has a daughter, Stephanie, played well by Evan Rachel Wood but her character never is fleshed out as more than just his lesbian daughter living with her girlfriend but it's never said. He just suspects and we don't know much about Stephanie's history in the first place. We don't have that connection between them which would help explain their wounded relationship. Maybe Stephanie is more her father's daughter than she pretends not to be. I didn't like the ending but I won't spoil it for anybody else except that it's not clear. Regardless, the film was shot on a very low budget but it's still inspiring and Mickey Rourke's performance is well alone worth the effort in watching him despite the pain and blood that comes with wrestling. If you didn't have any respect for wrestlers or strippers before the film, the film will make you look at wrestlers and strippers a little differently. Tomei's character, Cassidy, shows a different side of a stripper about aging in a profession where they don't want you too and where you're nothing but a piece of meat. In reality, Cassidy and Ram can both share in professions where they use their bodies. For both, it is not only a way of life but a living. For Cassidy and others in the profession, they make more money than working as secretaries in reality. Ram's whole life is wrestling. If you take that away from him, you take away his life's meaning.",8,1,1,25 January 2009
Kingpin," We don't have a cow. We have a bull.
","Woody Harrelson played a well-known bowler in retirement who stumbles upon an Amish man named Ismael (Randy Quaid). Together they stumble upon a cross country travel trip to Reno, Nevada. Bill Murray played a competitor. There are familiar faces but it's an okay film overall. I'm not particularly fond this Farrelly brothers film. I didn't find it too funny or entertaining. I liked the ending.",8,1,3,9 July 2019
Inception," It's a good film but not great!
","The whole concept of Inception is about planting ideas in the subconscious of another's mind. Christopher Nolan wrote, directed, and produced this film which has an impressive array of special effects, sequences, and issues about time. What is five minutes of dreaming can be an hour in the dream-state? Whatever it is, the cast is quite brilliant. Poor Sir Michael Caine who is not used enough along with Peter Postlethwaite OBE who is on for just as much. They are both great actors. The cast includes Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt, Ellen Page, Ken Watanbe, Marion Cotillard, and Cillian Murphy. The cast is first rate as well as the special and visual effects. There is a lot going on here and I was disappointed to learn Fischer's secret but I won't spoil it for you. The plot is more corporate espionage. Anyway, everybody in the dream game is hooked up by wires to the same machine of some kind. It reminded me of the film, Coma, where their bodies were suspended in the air. That was scary enough. I think the mind is an untouched part and not used enough but I wouldn't mess with it like this because there is always the trouble that you can't get back to reality which may not be so bad after all.",8,4,15,18 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Downey should have been nominated!
","Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job in playing the difficult, complicated role of Sherlock Holmes. Jude Law is perfect as Dr. John Watson. The rest of the cast is first rate as is the costume designs and art direction which is set in the mid 1860s. The story of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson always is a mystery. Dr. Watson is planning on moving and marrying lovely girl named Mary. Rachel McAdams plays a pivotal role in this story. There are a few funny scenes like Holmes waking up naked and cuffed by the scared maid and the bantering between Holmes and Watson whose relationship is never really explained. They say goodbye to notorious killer Lord Blackwood who is executed and promised to have three more dead. The script here needs some work and some of the stuff like Holmes' brilliance is hard to digest but it's an enjoyable adventure of a film. I still think Downey should have been nominated for an Academy Award for this performance.",7,0,2,21 March 2010
The Blind Side," Sandra's Oscar Nomination!
","Something is going to be wrong if Sandra Bullock isn't awarded an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actress for her performance Leigh Anne Tuohy, a Memphis interior designer, wife, and mother to Collins (a girl) and Sean Jr. She is married to successful Sean Tuohy, a former basketball star. They are both alums of Ole Miss or University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. Bullock does her best as portraying Leigh Anne to be both flawed and credible. She doesn't overdue her performance as the wealthy white woman who brings Big Mike home to their million-dollar home in Memphis for one night which lasts a couple of years. She warms up to him who changes the family in ways that probably wouldn't have been possible. Big Mike prefers to be called Michael. Until he became homeless, he was living on the couch of a neighbor in the slums who offered a place to stay because his mother has substance problems. Michael has flashbacks to his childhood but the film doesn't dwell on it so much. Michael gets into a private Christian school because they think he can play football. He comes with the man, Tony and his son, Steven. After Michael starts school, we hear an argument with Tony and his wife over Michael's situation.",8,1,2,26 December 2009
Music and Lyrics," Entirely Predictable and Entertaining!
","Drew Barrymore teams up with Hugh Grant in this romantic comedy about a washed up has-been eighties singer, Alex Fletcher, with Grant in that role. Drew plays a plant caretaker with a gift for lyrics. The two match up when Cora, Britney Spears type, offers Alex a chance to write a song for her based on a title. He has only a few days to come up with the song. Alex has survived his career in playing high school reunions, state fairs, and action parks. Now, he has a chance at a comeback since Cora is a huge fan but the music and lyrics have to work out as well. Thanks to Drew, they make a believable pair. They have a strong supporting cast like Brad Garrett playing Alex's manager and Kristen Johnston playing Drew's sister. It's an okay film overall. The writing could have been better but Drew and Grant make it believable on screen. They should get together more.",7,0,0,6 February 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Note on Riggan's dressing room mirror: A thing is a thing, not what is said of that thing.
","Michael Keaton earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for playing Riggan Thompson, a film turned stage actor. He was famous for playing the Birdman in the movies. In this film, he wants to succeed on Broadway in a play. Emma Stone played his daughter, Sam. Edward Thornton played his co-star in the play. Zach Galifankis played a producing partner in the production. Filmed on location in New York City, the film is about temperamental actors and the process being one. The film is somewhat entertaining except I can't stand the bird costume. Michael Keaton does a tour-de-force performance as Riggan, an unusual name. The film won an Academy Award for Best Picture. The film is quite entertaining especially with the cast. The ending doesn't make sense though.",8,0,1,17 July 2018
Platoon," Not Stone's Best Film to Date!
","I don't think this is Stone's best film to date. In fact, I loved JFK and consider it to be a masterpiece. Platoon is a war film and I'm not crazy about war films in general but Stone's direction and personal experience with Vietnam is clearly an effective tool in this film's brilliance. It's raw, ugly, dirty, and filthy but then what war isn't any of those things? As far as Vietnam films, I preferred the Deer Hunter but I am going to say that Platoon goes further where other films have not gone before. It's different when the director has been there and done it himself as a Vietnam veteran like Roman Polanski who survived World War II POland as a child. There is nothing that they are not afraid to show as if they are holding something back. This film is about war and the young men who go only to return home differently. As far as I know, this film is still important today as it was twenty years ago. First rate cast include Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger, and other young men.",8,1,3,20 November 2006
Halloween," Who's Afraid of the Boogey Man?
","Who would have thought that a film like this made on such a tiny budget would create such an impact on Hollywood thriller movies? Halloween was the first horror classic of a new generation. Just in time for this year's Halloween holiday, Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh) plays the target of demented Michael Myers who escapes from a mental institution where he was sent after killing his babysitter when he was just a child. He escaped around Halloween which is the anniversary of the murder. Anyway, Jamie is wonderful and shows that she has inherited her parents' acting ability enough to become a star in her own right as well. I love Donald Pleasance as the psychiatrist. I think he should have been knighted and this was one role that I think he loved because he returned several times. Sadly, he is not around anymore and I miss him dearly. I love his performance in this film. I think everybody had a great time making this film.",10,0,2,11 October 2006
The Queen," Dame Helen's Oscar Finally!
","Dame Helen Mirren is one of the world's foremost talented actresses that she has won countless awards. Her casting of Queen Elizabeth II is quite stunning considering that she already played her namesake and won an Emmy for it. She really becomes the Queen that we all know and love because she blends into the role so well that it's nearly impossible to think of her as the same person who played Jane Tennison, a Titanic Survivor in the S.O.S. Titanic. I admired Sylvia Syms and think she should become a Dame herself. James Cromwell is great as Prince Phillip and should get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as well. I can't forget Sylvia and think she deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as well. Stephen Frears really deserves nominations for recreating a week that was well unforgettable because it was so painful. I always knew that the Royals were real decent people with flaws and problems of their own. It's hard to imagine them as anything other than the caricatures that the British tabloid press make them out to be. The Royals have lived in a fishbowl their entire lives and will do so. It's not easy being Royal, I'm sure the Queen has her days as well.",10,11,19,15 September 2006
Raging Bull," A Classic Film by even today's standards!
","Martin Scorsese, Joe Pesci, and Robert DeNiro: When these guys get together, you know something big is going to happen and this film is a perfect example of great quality. Raging Bull is Jake LaMotta's rise and fall as an athlete to a nightclub performer. I think this is the film that Joe Pesci shows that even little guys can cause the most harm. When DeNiro and Pesci play the La Motta brothers, you believe it because they have such great chemistry with each other. I don't think Pesci was ever intimidated by Scorsese or DeNiro. This film earned DeNiro his second Academy Award and you can see why. Not only is the transformation, physical but emotional and psychological as well. These characters are flawed, human, and believable with great cast of actors. Don't forget Cathy Moriarty who was discovered to play Jake's young second wife. Even at 18, she can play younger and older and believable. His second wife can be beautiful and smart but trapped in a fractured marriage. She deserved her Academy Award Nomination for Best SUpporting Actress because she can handle herself against DeNiro and we see how he fell in love with her. Don't forget Pesci's wife is played Theresa Saldana who does hold her own. This film shows that black and white can still be beautiful film work. Nicholas Colasanto from Cheers is also in the film as well in a small role. Scorsese's best films are with DeNiro and Pesci at least in my opinion. At the end of the film, I wanted to know more about these characters.",10,2,2,16 February 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Definitely not for the Squeamish or Easily frightened!
","The Silence of the Lambs is one of the most frightening yet intense and intelligent films from the early nineties. The casting of Sir Anthony Hopkins as the evil Dr. Hannibal Lector was a perfect choice and he won an Academy Award for his 16 minutes of airtime. Jodie Foster deserved her second Academy Award for Best Leading Actress in this film. Jodie's Clarice Starling is perhaps one of the best female heroine roles of all time. I enjoyed watching this film again on AMC with tidbits of information on the bottom of the screen about the film-making. I would have like to have seen more Diane Baker on screen. I would have like to have known more about Dr. Lector's past too. The film always packs a punch when you least expect it at the end of the film. Besides great acting, directing, and writing, there is something unforgettable about this film. You walk away wondering about why this happens and about the monsters inside of them.",10,3,5,14 March 2005
Bruce Almighty," A Crack at Taking God's Job!
","Bruce Nolan was an aspiring journalist who wanted nothing more than the local anchorman job in Buffalo, New York instead of doing funny bits of news like the introduction where he is at Polish bakery celebrating the city's largest chocolate chip cookie. It starts off smart but it wears thin overall. Bruce is played by the unforgettable Jim Carrey who is brilliant at physical comedy much like John Ritter, Don Knotts, and Jerry Lewis in this film. Morgan Freeman plays God who transfers his powers to him to see what it would be like to be God. So Bruce is now God and he must hear prayers and confessions of everybody. God's job is not easy if you are believer. He has a lot of work but I take this comedy as is rather than serious drama. Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend (how did Brad Pitt trade her for Angelina is beyond me?). She is equally superb in the straight woman role. There are supporting players like Steve Carrell, Nora Dunn, and Sally Kirkland to name only a few.",7,1,1,12 June 2008
Mr. Holland's Opus," I can sympathize as a teacher!
","As an out-of-work teacher, I can see and understand Glenn Holland's desire to do more than just be remembered as a teacher but to create a piece of work. As an English teacher, I too aspire to break out the best novel to pull me out of my world. Teaching is hard and rewarding. It's not easy. Don't let anybody fool you otherwise. Richard Dreyfuss' performance as Glenn Holland is not only memorable but unforgettable one of his best roles. Glenne Headly is terrific as his wife. He has a fantastic supporting cast like Olympia Dukakis, William H. Macy, Jay Thomas, Alicia Witt, and others to support the film. The film is kind of a downer about a man who has spent thirty years of his life as a teacher in a small town. I was troubled by the fact that he and his wife stopped having children after Cole was born. I thought the deafness was to create friction between the musical father and his deaf son. Still, it's a good film. You'll cry a little.",7,3,3,1 July 2010
La Vie En Rose," Everybody loved Edith Piaf's voice! She sung for the masses!
","Edith Piaf was uneducated, poor, and sickly but she had a spectacular singing voice to reach and touch her audiences. In watching this film, I realize Edith's impact even to this day. Marion Cotillard plays her brilliantly and earned that Academy Award for Best Actress just like all the other accolades. It doesn't bother me that Cotillard didn't sing her part but she acted as Edith Piaf perfectly. She made me understand who Edith Piaf was as a person. Her childhood was grim, bleak, and miserable. She was a sickly child who was lucky to have survived. Her parents especially her mother had mistreated her. Her father actually cared for her more so but not enough. He was a performer himself as a circus contortionist. Edith's childhood did not lack it's share of misery. As she grew, she used her singing voice to earn money on the streets of Paris. She had a close circle of friends and there were those who believed in her. French movie icon, Gerard Depardieu, has a small part in the film as one of those who would advance her singing career. Edith had no shortage of heartache, pain, loss, and misery. When she sang on stage despite needing assistance to stand and walk, she glowed and shined unlike nowhere else. My only complaint is that I didn't see what happened to Edith during World War II.",9,3,4,21 February 2011
The Deer Hunter," Definitely a movie about war!
","In the end, it does not matter that you disagreed with the Vietnam War and America's involvement. This film is about the American men who went to Vietnam leaving in their relatives and friends behind to wonder what was happening over there. They went over there to serve their country because it asked them too or ordered them to go. Whatever the reason, the movie is full of fabulous performances by Meryl Streep, John Cazale, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, George Dzundza, and John Savage. I think the cast is well-ensembled and brilliantly acted. The small town in Pennsylvania is quite important to know the significant impact that the war had on small towns in America. Everybody was affected by their absence. Not knowing their fates is often worse than knowing it. After the war, three of the men must face their lives back home. They are never the same again. The game of Russian Roulette is used effectively and frighteningly. We must remember that the Vietnam vets suffer enormously from being taken hostage by Vietcong. It does not matter but they suffer psychologically. Walken definitely deserved his Oscar. I just keep thinking about John Cazale in his last performance. He is dying of bone cancer in reality and dies after filming is over. The Deer Hunter is truly a powerful theme. The deer is a representation of humanity. Humans hunting and killing in the jungles of Vietnam is not much different than hunting and killing harmless deer in the mountains.",10,2,4,4 July 2004
Am√©lie," A Sweet Magical Film but flawed!
","Audrey Tatou's performance as sweet, shy introverted Amelie is really a brilliant in the film. Of course, the film is quite playful and joyous at times. It's one of those feel good films that come around once in a while. Well, this film has a great cast. I loved Isabelle Nanty who plays hypochondriac tobacconist Georgette. She's a brilliant actress herself comically. This comedic, light-hearted and serious film at times is quite enjoyable to watch. I love the Parisian sites like Sacre Couer and Montmartre as well. Amelie tries to make lives better for those around her around the time of Princess Diana's tragic death. She wants and she dreams about being appreciated for all those good things. Amelie's childhood wasn't a happy one. She didn't have playmates. Her mother died tragically and her father the doctor was cold and distant. She works as a waitress in a bar/restaurant in Paris. She visits her father on Sundays. For the most part, Amelie is a lonely character until she herself falls for somebody.",8,1,4,18 December 2010
Shall We Dance," Dirty Dancing for the Mature Folk!
","It has a great cast with Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere as a married couple in Chicago. Jennifer Lopez has a supporting role as one of the dance instructors and Stanley Tucci who is always fabulous plays one of Gere's colleagues and dance enthusiast. Anyway, the plot about the husband going to dancing lessons and the wife suspecting that he's having an affair is a bit far-fetched but the cast works well together even if the storyline is weak. They filmed some of it in Chicago, a great city to visit. Anyway, the film is somewhat corny and predictable about the dance contest. Still it can be worth watching anyway with a great cast and crew. I forget who played Bobbie, the star dancer, she is familiar to me.",6,0,1,7 December 2006
Casino," It's like a roller coaster ride! It's addictive, fun, and entertaining!
","I love Casino especially if I watch it from the beginning. Robert DeNiro should have won an Academy AWard for this performance along with Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. The film is perfectly entertaining about casinos before it became Disneyland. There were other great performances by Don Rickles, Alan King, etc. The film is a Martin Scorsese film with two of his favorite actors--Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci giving Oscar performances. The script was fresh and entertaining. I also have to say that James Woods' performance as Ginger's pimp was worthy of being nominated for best supporting actor. THis film has several fabulous scenes and moments. By the end, you really don't want it to end because it's that good. I love how Ace and Nicky (Joe Pesci's character) narrate and explain the on-going activities between the Las Vegas Casino and it's connection to Kansas City, Missouri. I really enjoy watching the scenes of Ace being in control and the corruption that occurs. But it's that kind of film. You know what happens but you enjoy the ride anyway and I do enjoy this film. I always look forward to seeing it on the cable stations. Of course, Ace and Nicky's friendship is the crutch of this film.",10,3,5,8 February 2006
Get Him to the Greek," Well I hope you're wearing a condom cause I have a dirty mind.
","If you watched 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' you will make the connection. Aldous Snow was a character in that film. Russell Brand does a pretty good job in playing him. He's offensive, vulgar and obnoxious at times. Jonah Hill played a different character where he goes to London, England to collect Aldous Snow and bring him to Los Angeles at the Greek Theatre. It's harder than it sounds. Along the way, they stopped in New York and Las Vegas before making it in time to a sell out concert. It's not a bad film but not one of my favorites.",7,0,0,6 July 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," You Left Asking More Questions!
","I actually saw the Broadway musical of 'Spamalot,' based on this movie. While there were funny and memorable moments like when the killer rabbit appears and attacks the soldiers, this film can be confusing and you wonder what you're watching but it's still enjoyable. It takes place during the plague when almost everybody died and even there has a sense of humor. If you're not a Monty Python fan, you may not appreciate nor understand the humor of the film. Still, it's a comedy but a dark comedy with a great cast like John Cleese, Michael Palin, and many more. The ending was confusing to say the least and there were no actual credits on my DVD. Still, you have to see it once to appreciate the mockery of old British stories which is what it's aiming at like 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' and 'The Canterbury Tales.' You just sit back and enjoy without having to think too much about it.",8,1,2,9 April 2012
Saboteur," Classic Hitchcock!
","I picked up this film because it was a bargain since it was on VHS which is going out of style like black and white when color arrived on screen. This classic Hitchcock thriller works slowly but the pace is steady not too fast and the horror and thrills is watching us see the chase across country. The film stars Priscilla Lane (I have a very good friend named Priscilla after her who married a Lane). Robert Cummings plays a man who wants to clear his name rather than take the blame for his friend's death in Los Angeles. Along the way, he meets up with Lane's character and they head for New York City to uncover the Saboteurs in New York City. The final scene is worth watching for when the film is all over. Hitchcock may have made many other horror films but Saboteur is one of his better films.",9,1,3,25 January 2007
Moon," Just don't get it!
",While Sam Rockwell gives a tour De force performance as Sam Bell who lives and works on the moon for lunar industries. Gerty is voiced by the wonderful Kevin Spacey. Rockwell plays a very lonely astronaut whose wife and daughter are on earth. He is at the end of his three year mission contract when an accident happens. Surprise to say this film is per gravity but with paranoia and obvious isolation. The film asks more questions than answers about The two Sams and Gerty's role up there. Lunar industries has another agenda but I don't know what it is. The filming is spectacular and believable about the moon and its harsh conditions of life. Rockwell should have earned accolades for his performance here.,7,1,4,6 December 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Absolute Best Film of the Year! The one you can't miss!
","Truthfully, I didn't want to spend a couple of hours in a movie theater on Christmas Day but my sister wanted to see this film. It was a remarkable experience because it far exceeded my expectations. The casting was perfect with three actors playing the main role of Jamal Malik who goes from the slums of India to possibly becoming the first person to win the grand prize in Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? In the beginning, he is suspected to have been caught cheating and is interrogated for the night quite harshly but it's nothing compared to his life. He works as a gopher for a telemarketing office in Mumbai which is India's Hollywood. There is a reason for everything and the film is well-thought out and executed to perfection. The young actor who plays Jamal is brilliant in the role. Everybody in the film really delivers as well as the thousands of extras. Of course, there are difficult scenes to watch but I won't go there and spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I can see why this film is a front-runner for the Oscars. It has everything going for it including a great cast, a great script, and directed brilliantly with the perfect edited portions.",10,2,7,25 December 2008
The Breakfast Club," One of the greatest films of the 1980s
","I work with teenagers. I remember when I saw the Breakfast Club. It was on television, cable or regular, maybe both. I grew up in the 1980s and I can relate to this group of teens. This film was serious and funny, dark and light comedy all at the same time. John Hughes is one of my favorite directors of all time. Maybe it's because to the kids of the 1980s, we grew up knowing his films and the lines and the characters and everything in between. I lived in the suburbs. The characters here in this film are casted excellently. Molly Ringwald owes her career to John Hughes' films, so does Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and Emilio Estevez. We can't forget Paul Gleason and John Kapelos who play the principal and the janitor who worked a Saturday to remember. We all grew up with the lines from the film especially Johnny's. THe film touches a lot of issues like teen suicide, depression, child abuse, emotional and psychological abuse, and running away. We love the music and we remember the ending. We will always wonder what happened on Monday morning after their detention. What a school library, they make some public libraries to shame.",10,0,0,13 May 2006
Gladiator," Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
","Russell Crowe won an Academy Award for his performance. Joaquin Phoenix was great here as his Julius Caesar, power hungry and vengeful. His father, the Emperor, has chosen Maximus (Crowe) to succeed him. Julius kills his own father and terrifies his own sister. He kills Maximus' wife and son. Maximus is presumed dead but survives and avenges Caesar. It's a grand spectacle something like an old epic from the golden days of Hollywood. The acting is quite good with casting Richard Harris and Sir Derek Jacobi in supporting roles. The film is done well but it's very long though.",9,2,3,17 January 2020
The Social Network," A Brilliant Entertaining Look at the Facebook Success!
","Jesse Eisenberg earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in playing Mark Zuckerberg (the genius behind Facebook). This film recounts the history and the court case against him. The film flashes back between the depositions and the real life accounts. The supporting cast is first rate and the writing is nearly perfect. Justin Timberlake is fantastic as Sean Parker, the Napster genius, who mentors the young college students behind Facebook. Jesse's Mark isn't a likable character at times. Mark comes across as a jerk and obsessed with Facebook's success. The Harvard students are just like everybody else. We see Mark move to Silicon Valley where he rents a house across the street from Sean Parker. We see how Mark screws his best friend and business partner, Eduardo, who is a likable character torn between his devotion to Facebook and reality. The cast is first rate and I can see why this film got several accolades.",9,0,0,13 July 2013
The Wedding Singer," A great fun film to watch for the whole family!
","I was just watching the Wedding Singer last night on television. I still love this film for all its quirks. I love the fact that it was set in the eighties. Contemporary music and MTV with all its real world shows are not the same as in the eighties. I become very nostalgic watching this film. I remember all the songs, the Madonna look of the moment, the Rubix cube, Freddy Kruger, etc. It is hard to believe that it's almost twenty years since 1985. It was much better in 1985 for me, I was still a child and there were always music videos on MTV. They weren't just concert videos neither. They told little stories. I wished that we were still in the eighties with the music and culture. Besides all the eighties stuff, they never tried to outdo it in the film. It really is a beautiful, sweet love story between Drew Barrymore's character, Julia, and the wedding singer, Robby Hart. I love the flight to Vegas and I won't spoil the ending for anybody else. The scenes at reception hall were always a pleasure to watch and a great cast. I love watching fellow SNL--Jon Lovitz, Laura Kightlinger, Kevin Nealon, play even small roles. I loved Ellen Law playing Rosie. She was the best supporting character in this film. The fact that Billy Idol is also in it playing himself is another reason to watch. I wish there were films about the 80s.",8,6,12,13 September 2004
The Pursuit of Happyness," The True Pursuit of Happiness!
","Chris Gardner's inspirational story is brought to life by Oscar nominee Will Smith. His son, Jaden Smith, plays Chris' son Christopher in the film. In this story, Chris Gardner is a man who wants to be a broker at Dean Witter. Unfortunately, Dean Witter internships don't pay a salary for six months. I hope they changed that since 1981 when the story takes place. Chris Gardner must deal with his broken marriage and fights to keep his son. They move to a motel after they can't afford to live or pay the rent. Christopher is what keeps Chris going despite losing his apartment, his marriage, his car, but he also has six scanners which he tries to sell. They are bone density scanners sold to doctors. The cast is first rate with James Karen as one of the bosses. Chris Gardner is a man who would do anything and does. It's an inspirational story of father and son in the toughest of times.",8,0,0,19 June 2008
The Birds," When Birds go Wild!!!
","The Birds is a Hitchcock classic but I never understood why the birds attacked people in the first place. After all, they can go anywhere thanks to their flying capabilities. Tippi Hedren plays the female who travels to a small Northern California town from San Francisco to deliver love birds to a young girl played by Veronica Cartwright who becomes a great actress as an adult as she was a child. My biggest complaint is why the birds go mad in the first place. I admire Hitchcock for all his genius but I never get an answer and it's still an enjoyable movie. Maybe we just have to figure it out for ourselves or maybe we should stop abusing our habitat. The supporting cast includes Morgan Brittany, Darlene Conley, and Suzanne Pleshette as a school teacher.",9,1,3,11 November 2007
All the President's Men," Damn the Consequences!
","I can't imagine the thought of remaking this film. To begin with, the cast is amazing. You have Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Martin Balsam, Jason Robards, Jack Warden, Penny Fuller, Jane Alexander, Polly Holliday, Hal Holbrook, Valerie Perrine, Allyn Ann McLerie, Meredith Baxter Birney, Stephen Collins, Sloane Shelton, etc. Can you imagine a finer cast together? It would win a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble. The writing is also amazing as well. This is real life and based on a true story. Now that we know Deep Throat, we don't need somebody to make a remake of this film. You can't bring together a finer group of people. Alan Pakula is one of the finest directors. Sadly, it did not win Best Film. I don't know who it lost too but this film is still breathtaking, addictive, and always worth watching even with editing and dubbed language over some of the cursed words. Watching Redford and Hoffman play Woodward and Bernstein is like a great roller coaster ride. You don't want to watch but you can't imagine not at times. As journalists, they show the rigid dead ends of life before the computer age. Remember manual typewriters, no answering machines, library card catalogs, and paper records. The scene in which they are digging endlessly for receipts remind us of their hard work, sleepless nights, dead ends, answers from few brave souls who confessed about greed, money, lies, and corruption in our government. Imagine a simple burglary opened a Pandora's Box of American corruption. You still have to wonder about the people involved for real. Imagine yourself in their position or in Woodward and Bernstein who were brave, smart, and had the guts to do their journalistic jobs despite the consequences.",10,3,3,16 February 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Off to see the Wizard and Dorothy and Toto too!
","The Wizard of Oz has survived, thrived, and often influenced great works like Broadway's Wicked musical based on the evil witch who died. The story from L. Frank Baum's novel of the same name is adapted again but starring the wonderful Judy Garland as Dorothy, a role that never really escaped her identity. Margaret Hamilton, a former school teacher would play the evil witch in this version. The supporting cast of characters included munchkins that earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The munchkins introduced it's audiences to dwarf sized adults many of us for the first time. The Wizard of Oz and it's unforgettable cast of characters included in the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion. The film version has inspired spoofs and countless attempts to recapture it's brilliance. The cast and crew are unforgettable in developing one of the finest film classics of our time and with Judy's Over the Rainbow performance, you won't forget her ever.",10,5,6,20 April 2008
The Fighter," Christian Bale & Melissa Leo's Performances Shine Here!
","The Fighter was truly a story about Lowell, Massachusetts and two brothers. The brothers are played by Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. Bale is the older brother who has achieved some success beating out Sugar Ray Leonard but he became a drug addict and criminal. Bale's Dicky still coaches his little brother, Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. For Wahlberg, this story hits close to home because he's from nearby Dorchester. Anyway, Christian Bale earned his Academy Award as best supporting actor for his performance. There is no trace of his British accent. He simply becomes Dicky and whether you like him or hate him, he makes him simply sympathetic to the viewers. Wahlberg's Micky tries and succeeds at freeing himself from his over-protective mother Alice Ward (played brilliantly by Melissa Leo in her Oscar performance). As Alice Ward, Leo is unrecognizable from past performances. Amy Adams plays the girlfriend, Charlene, who loves Micky but makes him see his crazy family. There are moments in the film that are sweet like when Alice and Dicky are in the car at the crack house and they start singing together. This film has some flaws but not much in it. The police officer and trainer was the actual O'Keefe who had to audition for his role. Jack McGee is fine as the father as well. The sisters were okay but they were always together for most of the time. I couldn't tell one sister from the other. You see Alice Ward was married with Dicky's father and had a couple of his kids. She divorced him and remarried George Ward and added Micky and a few more girls to the family.",9,0,1,20 March 2011
V for Vendetta," People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.
","I have to say that watching this film on a long flight from London to Newark was kind of interesting. The Guy Fawkes masks were unpleasant to look at but it had another meaning. Imagine a world run by John Hurt's character, what brilliant casting that was to cast him. Remember he starred as Winston in the George Orwell novel based film, 1984, in 1984. Well anyway, he was perfect as the ruthless British dictator. I only caught the last hour of it but I can tell it was a great film filmed in London and Germany. His ruling party is basically a fascist culture much like the Nazis. They close the London Underground or at least they think. V is the mysterious guy in a mask who captures and releases Evie played by Natalie Portman. Ironic that they filmed this movie in Germany of all places but that's another story. Anyway, V is seen as a villain in the beginning until Stephen REa from the Crying Game begins to understand him as well as Evie does. It's a weird love story between Evie and V. I am giving it a 9 because I wanted to see V's face.",9,2,5,21 August 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Could have been so much better!
","First, I love Will Ferrell in almost anything. He makes me laugh whether it's a movie or on Saturday Night Live. His comedic partnership with John C. Reilly is perfect. In this film, I am glad that I waited for it to come on television. It has a great cast but the writing needs to be better. I love actress, Jane Lynch, who I think is too young to play Ricky Bobby's mother but I'll take her anytime. She's brilliantly funny. Gary Cole is perfectly cast as his estranged father. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the openly gay French race car driver with an American husband. He is a stark funny contrast to Ricky Bobby's character. The casting is perfect but the writing is weak in my opinion. Will Ferrell is hysterical as Ricky Bobby and John C. Reilly is equally brilliant as his best friend and rival. I only wished that the writers worked a little harder to be less vulgar and more funny.",7,0,0,23 December 2008
Semi-Pro," A bit disappointed!
","I have to say that I was disappointed with this Will Ferrell film because he is so talented and the cast is full of equally talented and known people like Woody Harrelson, Rob Corddry, Andrew Daly, Christine Wiig, and Maura Tierney. The film is set in 1976 in Flint, Michigan before the city took an economic turn for the worse. It's actually Michael Moore's hometown. It would have been nice to have seen him in the film. Unlike his Blades of Glory, his Jackie Moon is a lot more tamer than his Chaz Michael Michaels character. There is a scene with Patti LaBelle but I won't spoil it for you. Apart from the language and the surprised PG-13 rating, this film is a lot tamer about the American Basketball Association dissolving and only taking four teams to the National Basketball Association. Will the Flint Tropics be one of the lucky teams, you will have to watch and see. There are some moments like when Jackie Moon wrestles with an actual bear and jumps over the cheerleaders to help improve audience numbers. Will Ferrell is still one of my favorite performers and even though the script needs improvement, the film is still watchable.",5,1,2,30 June 2010
The Godfather," Definitely one of the best films ever made
","The Godfather is truly an excellent film with a sensational cast, genius writing, and direction. Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again.",10,2,6,28 November 2001
