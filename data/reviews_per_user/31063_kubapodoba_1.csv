Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," In my opinion a masterpiece
","That Movie..man I'm lost for words. I'm currently 21 years olds I went for the premiere back in 2011 when I was like 12 years old. And I liked it back then I remember.
But since they've added it on Netflix I've decided to rewatch both parts.
And oh my god. I had no idea how good of a movie it is .
Ofc every movie has its flaws and and nothing is perfect.
But Robert Downey jr is playing his part excellent being super smart a bit crazy, sometimes cocky yet remaining British with British humor :D. The plot is good imo not many moments when the action slows down so you're always entertained. I wasn't bored for one second watching it.
Adding the music which has a nice rhythm and happy jingles of those times makes you really immersed into the action.
But the technical aspect of this movie BLEW MY MIND. The slow motion in this movie is the best I've seen in the industry. And I'm watching this movie in 2020!!
Not gonna spoil anything but the scene in the woods BLEW MY MIND. Like crazy.
I definitely recommend watching it, I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
Looking forward to 2021 and Sherlock 3!!",10,2,4,20 February 2020
