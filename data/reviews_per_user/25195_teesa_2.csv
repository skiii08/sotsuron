Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," WOW!! I loved almost all of it!
","From a person who absolutley hated the first Star Wars movies, this one is outstanding... There is so much action in it, that you do not get bored, untill the end, that part is dragged out a little.  Anyhow, people who don't like it need to just relax, yeah, it isn't the same Star Wars as before, Hello Losers, it isn't supposed to be!!! And don't diss the director, he can do whatever the hell he wants to, he did the first one how he wanted, and if he wants these ones to be different just role with it.  I do think we should have been able to spend more time with each character, but then again my butt was numb after the three hours it took to watch it like it is, if it were any longer I wouldn't be able to walk for weeks.If you missed it in the theaters, I don't know if I would bother renting it, you definately need the huge screen and surround sound.",Null,0,0,20 October 1999
Spice World," Wow, ouch that had to hurt!
","I am not a Spice Girls fan, but tried to watch the movie anyway just for some laughs.  Instead I ended up turning it off about 15 min into it.  The only part I saw was when they were on the bus and I couldn't take it.  If you are a huge fan of theirs then perhaps you would like it, anyone else, please don't waste your time or money, you'll definitely be disappointed.",Null,7,13,30 September 1999
