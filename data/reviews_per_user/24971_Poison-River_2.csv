Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vamos A Matar, Companeros!!!
",":Spoilers: :Spoilers: :Spoilers:The only thing disappointing about this film is the weak-tea reviews being dished out by some critics. Critics who should know better. There's an unhealthy air of 'Kill-The-King' Syndrome doing the rounds.Let's not beat about the bush, this film is a MASTERPIECE, and is infinately better than Vol.1. All the kick-and-rush of Vol.1 is replaced here with pacing, depth and texture. This is a homage, not just to Spaghetti Westerns in general, but to the ultimate Spaghetti; Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In The West'. The opening scene with Bill and Beatrix outside the Two Pines Chapel is played out against almost total silence, pretty much like the opening of Leone's marvel. Beatrix then makes a long, slow methodical process of elimination as she wipes out those who surround Bill, almost in identical fashion to Charles Bronson's 'Harmonica' as he edges closer and closer to Henry Fonda's reptilian villain, 'Frank'. The final confrontation between Beatrix and Bill is also similar to the meeting of Harmonica and Frank; it is long and never rushed(there's almost 50 minutes between Beatrix bursting through the door, and the eventual outcome). Just as Harmonica and Frank's confrontation is dealt with in mutual respect, dignity and understanding, so Bill and Beatrix's final meeting is touching and emotional as both still love each other, but must ultimately kill each other. Bill's death is dignified and romantic, a master-stroke from Tarantino.The film is heavilly littered, or should that be bejeweled with references to the great Spaghetti Westerns; the backwards tracking shot out of the Chapel as the Deadly Vipers move in is pure Leone; the mariachi trumpet score from 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and the whistling motif from Sergio Corbucci's 'Il Mercenario'; and the whole chapter of Budd and his reformed 'gun-slinger' taking on a lousy job but being dragged into one last job for a suitcase full of cash, these are all classic Italian Western traits. Just as Vol.1 was his Eastern, so Tarantino now gives us his Western.The acting in this movie is astonishing. David Carradine is an utter revelation, and his lengthy monologues are a joy to listen to. Uma Thurman again delivers, and kudos to Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen for putting in the performances of their career.The 'buried-alive' sequence comes as blessed relief to someone like me who was haunted by the denouement of George Sluizer's 'Spoorloos', and remains surely the most atmospheric and realistic burial scene in movie history.Only two loose-ends bother me; What happened to Sofie Fatale? And if Bill felt Beatrix could never lose her Assasin mantle and live a normal life, how come he allowed Vernita to do just that? She married, had a child and settled into the family-routine. Hmmmm......That aside, this is a work of genius, PURE GENIUS. 10/10.",10,0,1,24 April 2004
The Girl Next Door," A Pleasant Surprise
","I really expected this to be awful, clich√©d and embarrassing....BUT, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Whilst strictly a teen-movie(in premise at least) there is a fair amount of nudity and swearing to lift this out of the cheese-factor. Emil Hirsch is an amiable male lead, while Elisha Cuthbert looks far more beautiful here than she ever did in '24', although it's interesting that she looks better when appearing natural, than when dolled up as a porn-starlet. Timothy Olyphant adds a certain menacing charm to proceedings by apparently playing a watered-down version of the character he plays in 'Go'.All in all a pretty good little movie that deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it got upon it's release. Better suited for older teens though.",8,4,4,19 April 2006
