Antz," Marvelous, Classic Animated Picture
","This movie was truly a splendid look at one ant's life, and how he feels the need to break away from his monotonous, boring life... with the princess of his colony.With a star-studded cast, headed by the always great Woody Allen, ANTZ! is a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of seeing.Highly recommended (Especially in DVD format!).",8,1,1,27 May 2000
