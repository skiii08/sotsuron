The New World," Somehow I just love this movie
","Reading the reviews, I can tell this movie wasn't popular with the average movie-goer, and I can't really blame them or expect them to agree with me. So, maybe this is a very personal review, but I found this movie very pleasing to my taste. I enjoy movies that are soft and calm. It's very calming and stress-reducing. And I love the way it was edited to show her transition from innocent child-likeness to womanhood. I thought the editing was brilliant because it moved along at a slow but continual pace, like the river so often shown in the movie. But most of all, I loved the interaction between the actors, especially Q'Orianka. She's so hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing. I wish this movie could have gotten more love because I feel so alone in my love for it. But for now, I'll continue to enjoy it on my own and treasure it as one of my favorites.",10,0,0,15 July 2018
Passengers," I actually like the story, but...
","I found Jennifer Lawrence's acting distractingly bad and over-the-top. It FELT like acting, and that's no good. I think had it been a better actress I would've given it a 10. Other than that, I liked the style, the visuals, and the story. Chris Pratt made me sympathize with his character's decision.",8,3,4,25 May 2019
Aquaman," Up there at least to Wonder Woman's level
","I thought it was entertaining and had an interesting plot. The visual effects were amazing. I kept thinking, oh my gosh, how much did that one shot cost? But for being a mostly CGI movie, it worked, and it made me think a live action version of The Little Mermaid may be possible after all. And the action sequences actually held my interest! What I think a lot of people will not like about this movie is that it had more of a comic book-y feeling than the others, but that's probably why I liked it! With that being said, it meant that the costumes were laughably over-the-top. I would say the weakest aspect of the movie is the acting, which is pretty sub par, especially from the 2 leads and Aquaman's teenage self (that acting was cringe-worthy!) Overall, between this film and Wonder Woman, I think DC may have a chance of catching up to Marvel!",9,3,6,26 December 2018
