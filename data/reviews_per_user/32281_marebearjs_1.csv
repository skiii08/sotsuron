Walk the Line," awesome movie!!!
","This movie was worth every second!!! Juaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon had amazing chemistry together, it almost made you want to cry. The way they sang all the songs and told Johnny's life story truly did him justice. They did not make him out to be a hero like most biographies would, they just told his life the way it was. After seeing this movie you will leave the theaters moved and very emotional. If possible you also leave the theater having more appreciation for Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. I cannot describe how brilliant this movie was. Watching this movie made my boyfriend and I feel like he was so legendary that he was almost fantastic.If you haven't seen this movie yet, GO SEE IT! now, immediately!",10,2,5,21 November 2005
