The Hangover," Over the top
","Some parts were funny. I found myself cracking up but I think it could have been done a lot better. A little far-fetched and silly at times. The acting was alright. I don't think it flowed well and the editing left much to be desired. The chicken in the room was funny but the whole thing with Mike Tyson was over-the-top. He's not funny nor that whole segment. The Chinese gang angle was funny. The climax of the movie was terrible. That should have been thought out more. But then again, I'm just a reviewer and making movies is hard and it's a tough business. Overall, I enjoyed it but I think it could have been thought out a little better. It had the potential to be a classic but fell short. Maybe the producers were pressed for time.",6,0,0,5 January 2010
