The King's Speech," Choice of music?
","Masterpiece theatreish movies aren't my cup of (very British) tea, so I don't find much interesting about the movie with a couple of exceptions, and I will leave it to others to gush with praise. Of course the performances are fine (those British can act) and it was a treat to see Claire Bloom again, if only briefly (and even if I didn't recognize her at all). It struck me odd that the future king, who was surely reared better, would act so ungentlemanly toward Logue, even if the latter certainly takes social liberties. Does noblesse no longer oblige? But I was particularly surprised at the choice of (mostly) background music, especially at the climactic point of the big speech about Britain going to war with Germany. I wonder why they chose all German music (slow movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony and slow movement of Beethoven's 5th ('Emperor') piano concerto. Surely it isn't explained by the German blood in the royal family. Surely they could have found some rousing music by British composers.",Null,0,2,15 February 2011
