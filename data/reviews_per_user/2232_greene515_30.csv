Vertigo," Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding,
","It's hard to believe 'Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' wasn't a box-office success when originally released in 1958, It has since taken its deserved place as Hitchcock's greatest, most spellbinding, most deeply personal achievement. James Stewart plays a retired police detective who is hired by an old friend to follow his wife Kim Novak, whom he suspects of being possessed by the spirit of a dead madwoman. Shot around San Francisco (the Golden Gate Bridge and the Palace of the Legion of Honor are significant locations) and elsewhere in Northern California (the redwoods, Mission San Juan Batista) in rapturous Technicolor and VistaVision, Vertigo is as lovely as it is haunting.",10,2,4,4 June 2010
Black Swan," Riveting
","'Body Shock' is something of which that Director Darren Aronofsky specialises in, it is an unusual trademark which is featured in his previous efforts such as 'Requiem For A Dream' and 'The Wrestler' 'Black Swan' is no exception.In her deserved Oscar winning role Nina (Portman), fit's the bill as the sensitive dancer who is constantly monitored and domineered by her over protective Ex Dancer Mother Barbara Hershey.Nina is promoted to prima for a new production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, Nina's demanding Boss the excellent Vincent Cassel, Beckons Nina to delve deep in to her dark side so she can embody the dual role of the Swan Queen and the Black Swan. However tensions run high upon arrival of rival dancer Lily, Mila Kunis which the two dancers extend their rivalry which descends into a bizarre friendship, which drives Nina into a spiralling descent to madness where she literally embodies the physical persona of the title. One can see direct references to Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes,",Null,0,0,18 July 2011
Walk the Line," One OF The Best Movie Biopic's Ever!
","Joaquin Phoenix, Walk's a fine line of excellence, in this fantastic true life music biopic of the one and only Johnny Cash, Whom Joaquin Phoenix, uncannily emulates, Essentialy picture starts with the legendary Folsom prison gig which effectively bookends the film, This film charts the young Cash from his itinerant childhood to his days as a struggling salesman/come wannabe musician, And his days on the road which cash resists everything but temptation,Reese Whitherspoon, in her first Oscar winning role(And deservedly so) Plays the equally legendary June Carter Cash, who sticks with Cash during his turbulent times,In my own opinion 'Walk the line'is a fantastic picture,which also has an equally fantastic soundtrack,",10,1,2,28 March 2006
In Bruges," There will be blood!(Too much!)
","'Martin McDonough's 'In Bruges' with the dream casting of Colin Farrell, and Brendan Gleeson, as bumbling hit-man, and seasoned hit-man who flee to the beautiful city of the title after Farrell botches a hit, the pair take in all the sights the beautiful city has to offer, the rest of the film chronicles Farrells wayward romance with a beautiful drug dealer who supplies film crews with drugs, there is an amusing subplot which Farrell befriends a diminutive actor who is making a 'eurotrash' film on location, the villain of this film is Ralph Fiennes who literary phones in his performance, his role is very like a take off of Sir Ben Kingsley in ' Sexy Beast' Gleeson receives orders to take do away with his protégé, but failing to do so only incurs the wrath of Fiennes,who travels to Bruges for an overtly bloody shootout,The downside to this film is the 'overuse' of strong language which is evidently used in a conversation with Ralph Fiennes and Gleeson it's usage is akin to a swearing contest! how many times do we have to hear the dreaded 'C***' word uttered? in the space of one minute almost twelve! one of the 'funny moments' which at least tries for laughs is Farrell's berating of an obese American family who are offended by his remarks regarding their weight! the scene is amateurish in it's staging and would best suit the cutting room floor, or deleted scene section on the DVD. Unfortunately the 'shoot em up' climax is marred with a downbeat 'shoot em up 'climax which feature some of the most realistic gunshot wounds ever committed to celluloid Sam Peckinpah would be proud! gore-hounds will not be disappointed with the liberal overuse of blood and gore which seem left over from a previous film albeit of an Eli Roth nature( witness Brendan Gleeson fall from the tower a bit over the top, but nevertheless very well done) I was reasonably entertained by this but feel that the filmmakers could of toned down the content instead of going all the way to 'eleven' Gorehounds will be pleased everyone else will probably have a sour taste in their mouths. for a better buddy,buddy pairing there's '48 Hrs' 'Midnight Run'",2,14,45,26 March 2008

Warrior," A Knockout
","'Warrior' is an outstanding Mixed Martial Arts/Boxing film, Joel Edgerton star of 'The Thing' Prequel is excellent as Brendan Conlon a Physics Teacher who is battling the bank from declaring bankruptcy, In an effort to save his home he participates in several MMA bouts, in order to pay off his loans. His estranged and deeply troubled brother Tommy who has eloped from his unit in Iraq returns on the scene and also competes in the MMA scene, where we see several brutally realistic bouts take place not just with other MMA hopefuls but eventually between the two brothers. The two leads are excellent, Joel Edgerton is entirely convincing as is Tom Hardy who is terrifying and brutal in the ring. Nick Nolte is amazing in his role as the equally troubled father who trains Hardy, one can argue that it appears that Nolte resembles Lee Marvin in his appearance. Nolte's portrayal has won him universal critical praise and rightly so.",Null,1,5,6 October 2011
Quantum of Solace," Bond, James Bond in the style of Bourne,Jason Bourne
","Quantum of Solace (2008) is the twenty second and counting bond production to date with the new bond Daniel Craig, in my own opinion this isn't a stand alone bond per Se but more of a companion piece to it's predecessor 'Casino Royale' where it pick's up moment's from where Casino Royale concluded, unfortunately my own nitpick's of the film is the absolutely terrible title 'song' another way to die 'sung' by Jack White and Alicia Keyes' they really should of stayed with first choice Amy Winehouse. gone is the traditional linear editing this makes it very unclear what is going on in the fight scenes but i guess it's realism is what the filmmaker's are going for or that they are trying to compete with the Bourne identity. the villain played by Matthieu amaracic who resembles Roman Polanski)who play's the villain Domnic Greene is more or less an unconventional choice which also remind's one of Louis Jordan in 'Octopussy' the obligatory Bond Girl Olga Kuryenko is simply a stunning addition to the series, expendable Gemma Atherton play's Agent Field's it is later revealed in the credit's ( her first name is strawberry) the late Roy Kinnear's son Rory make's a welcome addition to the series as an aid to 'M' Dame Judi Dench who like Casino Royale is given more to do. unfortunately with it's frenetic hand held photography and editing Quantum of Solace certainly deserves another viewing to fully appreciate it. all in all an entertaining companion piece to Casino Royale'",10,6,15,3 November 2008

Neville does research in his basement laboratory to try and find a cure for the virus, and regularly sends out radio messages, calling for other survivors to come and meet him, I Am Legend, spent decades languishing away in development hell, it should of stayed there! this is evident as what really is a great premise is wasted. There must of been a deadline to get this made, and the flaws are all too apparent witness the rubbish CGI effects (the CGI mutated dogs spring to mind) and also the creatures. in my opinion watch Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man' it's a much,much better film.",1,6,7,31 December 2010

Liam Neeson(who despite his excellent acting abilities cannot make 'taken' a good film, let alone an original film it's all been there and been done before!for instance it seems that this film shamefully rips off the famous chase scene from 'French Connection II' and even the aforementioned boat climax from 'Ashanti' the usual frenetic 'Bourne Identity' style of movie-making is ever present in this film one unfortunately with the horrible 'trend' to please the censor's 'Taken' also has alternate versions which no doubt are bloodier seedier, whatever! but the editor's scissors cant save this disaster of a film.",1,5,16,29 January 2010

The Last King of Scotland," Forest Whitaker. in the role he was born to play!
","'The Last king of Scotland' is by far in my own opinion the best film of 2006' current acting favorite, James Mcavoy, plays a wet behind the ears young doctor, who sets out on a voyage of self discovery and more, travel's to 1970's Uganda where he becomes caught up in a political coup,and inadvertently becomes involved, and subsequently becomes personal physician and adviser, to madman dictator Idi Amin, initially he is treated like royalty by the Scottish culture loving Amin, played by Forest Whitaker in the role he was born to play, the resemblance is frighteningly uncanny. Whitikaker's performance mixes black comedy, and all out paranoia. The young doctor, then is caught in a powerful struggle between Amin and his horrific regime, this film's attention to detail is stunning shot on super 16 film stock which has a stunning effect that genuinely looks like it was produced in the 70's.

","Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke), once a former big name in the sport but now long past his prime.the camera follows Randy around as he conducts his business, giving us ample views of the back of his head with its long mane of bleach-blond hair. However a picture surely emerges of a dedicated loser, living on the edges of past glories, the law of diminishing returns eating into him minute by minute. Randy is now relegated to the small-time independent circuit and the measly handful of dollar bills he collects for a bout won't stretch to paying the rent on his trailer home - or maybe that's because he spends too much of it on booze and his favorite lap dancer, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei),in her most 'revealing' performance to date! down at his local club. Randy is alone in the world and his only family is his daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), who has such a mountain of issues with her father that she can't stand the sight of him.
