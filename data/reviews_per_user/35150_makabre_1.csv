Alien 3," Who thinks Scott and Cameron should go back and do the third again.
","Seriously...Cameron made a perfect nuclear family out of odds and ends as it were. Hicks, Newt and Ripley. with todays CGI technology they could get a CGI newt to be at the crash site or in the ship whatever the story could be. and then go forward a couple of years to them all living together....of course its sounds pretty bad but I'm just brainstormiong.I did not mind Alien 3, sure it needed work for it to match anywhere near the previous two in success but I hated the fact that the writer killed off two characters that could have made something new in the trilogy.I think even Cameron complained about that making me think that fox are a money grabbing bunch of ...., i mean why do you think the Simpsons rip on them all the time. I love Finchers work and don't blame him I blame the writer.I think that Scott and Cameron would go back and do something different. like the Alien getting back to earth or something like that...I mean even the stories in the comics seem like a good place to start...even if their plots are paper thin.lol. Maybe its not a good idea and I don't know the ins and outs of Hollywood...but I'm betting if two BIG directors like them got together. Weaver, Beihn and anyone else would definitely be willing to do another...I mean its almost impossible to get as bad as alien resurrection. That would make my life happy if it happened but hey its just a dream.",6,3,5,10 September 2006
