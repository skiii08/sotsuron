Blade Runner 2049," Fail
","I gave up half way.
I really like science fiction and wanted to like this movie because the original was always so highly rated. But thing is I didn't like either. This movie was was dull & boring and only a little less so than the original. Hopefully this one doesn't become a franchise. A stinker or a remake of stinker which is also a stinker ...... you know what I mean .......",3,7,12,19 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Korg !!!!!!
","This is the best of the Thor movies and one of Marvels most solid efforts. Lots of action and humour. Both Thor & Hulk are great and work well together. Really liked Korg , a very funny character who I'd like to see more of. A typical hero movie but still worth watching.",7,1,3,8 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," OK
","I went to see this one at the movies with my son.
It was ok, watchable, but definitely one of Marvel's weaker efforts. A bit lame at times, and nothing new really added. The main actor is likeable and did a good job with the script he was given. Which was a little less intense and maybe directed at a younger age group than previous efforts. 
My 8 year old son liked the movie but did not rate it as highly as some of the other Marvel movies, he was slightly disappointed with it.
I recommend you give it a go, something to watch at home on a rainy day.",5,1,3,19 June 2018
Interstellar," Did I miss something?
","The movies backdrop is sensational, the premise of the movie is good to. The movie however is slow, boring, long winded ....... Did I just describe Christopher Nolan?",1,1,4,21 June 2018
Bird Box," Ok
","The beginning of the movie was great, had me hooked. Then it sort of ran out of steam. The ending was disappointing. Sandra Bullock was great, really intense. Worth a watch.",5,0,1,26 December 2018
Dunkirk," Boring
","This movie is supposed to be a masterpiece, I had high expectations. Half way in and I was bored out of my mind. It's hard to follow and there are no real characters that engage you. What a stinker.",1,3,6,21 June 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Solid effort
","Enjoyed this one, plenty of laughs, action and all your favourite characters. A few surprises at the end which sets up the next movie and has you wanting more. Another solid effort",7,0,3,8 July 2018
Django Unchained," Great
","Like this movie. Great storyline, likeable characters, lots of action. Enjoy",8,0,3,21 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Good Effort
","A decent effort, lots of suspense , action. The plot isn't perfect but the movie is still gets lots of things right. Some reviews are too harsh. Plus love Blunt , she's awesome. Worth watching",7,1,1,11 January 2019
Logan," Awesome / SO GOOD !!
","Logan is basically the best super hero / anti-hero movie I have ever seen.
Hugh Jackman absolutely nails his part as does Dafne Keen who is so intense and fearless. Everything about the movie is great, from the Characters to the scenery, the script and the ending which is not at all typical. The movie is violent and in your face, possibly not for the faint hearted or young children. I have seen it a few times and expect that I'll end up watching it again. Awesome",8,2,4,19 June 2018
Life Is Beautiful," Fantastic
","A beautiful movie, absolute masterpiece. A must watch movie.",9,1,4,21 June 2018
The Shape of Water," Overrated
","Fantastic back drop, costumes etc, it looks great. The storyline is weak , obvious, ridiculous. Shocked at how highly rated this movie is.",2,27,47,16 December 2018
Wonder Woman," Rubbish
","Another highly rated movie that ended up being a dud. The storyline was average, the acting not any better.",1,2,8,21 June 2018
The Greatest Showman," One of the best in 2017
","Hugh Jackman is fantastic, such a diverse actor, he can do it all. Not normally a fan of musicals, usually stay away from them. This movie is funny, touching and also uplifting. The music is lovely. A great movie to watch with the whole family. A must see",8,1,2,8 July 2018
Alien: Covenant," Give it up
","Doesn't come close to the originals.
I think this franchise has come full circle. They've run out of ideas and now are just cashing in. Let it go, move on.",3,1,4,21 June 2018
