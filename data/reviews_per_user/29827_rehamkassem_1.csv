It," Disappointing
","I don't know about the high rating thing, but it's definitely worth a 5! the movie is not even scary at all and I knew this bought the ticket, but I was told that the story behind it is really good so I was like alright sounds good, but it turned out to be childish. I already knew what it was all about in the middle of the movie. The scary characters weren't scary at all, they really looked normal, a clown, a weird lady who is not scary and even the jump scares didn't get me. Me and my friends got disappointed",5,0,4,21 September 2017
