Frost_Nixon," Refreshing and Candid
","While I am not an expert on Watergate, I have read quite a bit on Nixon and the performance by Frank Langella was absolutely stunning. While he does not quite look like Nixon, or quite sound like him, 10 minutes into the move you think it is Nixon. It is a masterful performance.The movie itself was pretty good. It is not great, though the ending is great, if that makes sense. First let me say, the movie drags for about an hour mid way through. While the scenes with Nixon are riveting, the parts of David Frost are just not that interesting. Probably because he in real life, he is simply just not a guy you are dying to learn about.While I have not seen the actual Front/Nixon interview tapes in their entirety, those that have concede they were painfully boring with the exception of the Watergate segment, which riveted the nation.And that was the movie too. The movie was from David Frost's point of view, because it had to be. If it were from Nixon's point of view, nobody would have cared because in reality nobody really cares about David Frost. The movie does have some interesting moments, but nothing memorable....except the scenes with Nixon.What made the movie was the final 20 minutes. While it was not Ron Howard's intent, you do feel sorry for Nixon in the end. Maybe it's because many years have passed. Maybe its because the last two guys we have had in the oval office have been so unpresidential, it's refreshing to see an larger than life figure.Frank Langella carried this movie. Without him, it would have been a bust. But with him, its one of the year's best. Stick with the middle of the movie and be patient. The ending is powerful.",8,2,5,27 December 2008
Two for the Money," Pacino needs to work on his script selection
","I went into this movie determined to like it. I usually enjoy dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc...I went into this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I am a big Pacino fan.What a piece of garbage. Quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in five years. This makes Pacino's debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we get it. You are in shape Matt. We don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron, shirtless.Secondly, how many plot holes are in this movie? Why introduce the phone call from Brandon's long lost Dad and never address it again? What was the point of his Mom hanging up on him - why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money - what was the point of that? The guy from Puerto Rico who lost 30 million? Also, since sports betting is illegal in NY, and its acknowledged its illegal, how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet at the end? This was simply a very poorly written script. It had potential, but it was devoid of a coherent plot. I thought Pacino learned his lesson about script selection after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My Gosh, this is the same actor that starred in the Godfather! Don't waste your money.",2,6,11,27 October 2005
American Sniper," As a Conservative, thumbs down
","I cannot believe I will agree with Michael Moore, ever. But Snipers are cowardly. I get it, they are necessary in modern warfare. But to glorify a sniper is like glorifying your pest control agent.The entire movie is about a sniper picking off Iraquis. They walk in the street and Bradley Cooper picks them off one by one. You got like 2 hours of this, over and over.I don't get this movie or the hype. It seems the only one that made out was the widow of the real like Sniper, she is walking away with 10 figures from the rights. She is happy no doubt.If you like video games where people shoot random people this is definitely your type of movie. IQ over 100 stay away.",1,7,24,9 April 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," Very big let down
","I bought this movie because '2001: A Space Odyssey', was one of the 'classics' I had not yet seen. I had a brief prior understanding of the plot (the whole Hal thing), but was fairly in the dark about this movie. I was excited when I sat down to watch it.I can honestly say I gave this movie a shot, but for me, this movie was something akin to watching a plant grow for three hours. I am sure there are some that find this movie to be a masterpiece. But I have to believe for most of the public, this movie was almost intentionally boring.Now intellectuals will claim, 'You just don't understand the brilliance of 2001: A Space Odyssey'. Well I am hear to tell you it it has nothing to do with understanding...rather its about 'wanting to understand'. I have no interest in spending 3+ hours of my life being supremely bored, trying to analyze what Stanley Kubrick was trying to communicate 35+ years ago.The purpose of any movie is to entertain, and if after being entertained you can take away a deeper meaning in a movie, then all the better. But you first must have an entertainment value, which in my opinion this movie was devoid of.When I finally hit the stop button on this movie, I could not describe how let down I was. I am not into space movies all that much. Lasers, phasers and androids are not my thing. But one of my favorite movies was 'Alien' - A slow paced movie that thrived into a classic because of the incredible suspense associated with it. There was a great payoff after the first hour of waiting.When I was in college, in my Literature class we used to sit around for hours discussing what the author (i.e Twain, Hemmingway, Poe, etc...) 'really meant' in his book. I always used to suggest he meant what was written in his/her book, hence why he wrote it. I was usually dismissed as 'not getting it' as others suggested some deeper meaning, something the author did not write, but somehow what he actually meant.OK, whatever. Everyone is different. Some people see 2001: A Space Odyssey as a masterpiece. I see it as an extremely over-hyped movie, the most boring movie I have ever seen and I will never watch again.And in the rare case this movie had some deeper meaning that Stanley Krubrick wanted you to find, I have to ask....Who Cares?",2,36,72,28 January 2006
