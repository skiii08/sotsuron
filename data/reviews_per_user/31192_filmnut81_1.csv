The Ring," Not bad...
","I just saw this movie about 2 hrs. ago, in the ever so unique George Lucas Surround Theatre. I have to say that this movie was creepy. Even though it brought out the 'The Sixth Sense' feeling, I enjoyed the cinematography it offered, and score as well. Some parts scared the h*** out of me, with the weird screeching sounds. Without that, it wouldn't have been as creepy as it is. Go see it, just for the fun of it, not expecting a teen slasher flick. I believe we've had enough of those, huh?7 out of 10",Null,0,0,6 November 2002
