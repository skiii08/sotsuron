The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It will leave you on the edge of your seat, anxious to see what will be waiting in Mockingjay Part 2.
","This film is the third movie following The Hunger Games trilogy. It is the first of two films following the novel Mockingjay. The film follows the story of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). The film begins with Katniss waking up in District 13. She has survived two hunger games and has now been retrieved by District 13, who was once thought to be non-existent. During the film Katniss works with the president of District 13, President Coin (Julianne Moore) to start a right in the Districts to rebel against the Capital. Reunited with her sister Prim (Willow Shields), her mother, and Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss agrees to become the Mockingjay. A symbol for all of the Districts to symbolize and follow. Throughout the film the Capital and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) attempt to take down Katniss and District 13. President Snow is using Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) against Katniss. He knows that she loves him and in the beginning of the film, he drugged and used in attempts stop the rebelling throughout the Districts over the Capital. However, Katniss is determined to bring Peeta to District 13 with her. District 13 is successfully able to retrieve Peeta along with the other victors from the Capital. However, it is not what she expects. Peeta has been brainwashed and is programmed to kill Katniss. Peeta is kept in isolation in attempts to undo the hi-jacking' of his brain, as they call it. The film is the groundwork for Mockingjay Part 2, where District 13 will take on the Capital. The theme of the film is to start a riot in the brainwashed Districts against the capital for the right of humanity. The film is centered on making the other people in the District see what is really happening in the Capital and to never lose hope. Katniss takes on the role as the Mockingjay to serve as a mascot for the fighting they are about to face. Many people in the Districts were unaware of the happenings in the other Districts and were not aware of the unfair treatment they had been receiving. Katniss works to reveal to them the cruelty against humanity and to take the Capital, which is the leading of brutality against the Districts. This film is very similar to the Divergent. That film involves a plot of citizens living in community divided by factions. The factions are unequal, just as the Districts. Much like the Hunger Games, the story involves tragedy in children/teens. The Hunger Games chooses their gaming entertainment among children, while Divergent determines the faction of each person as they are children. Divergent is the beginning of a rise against the government to end the abuse against humanity and the faction lifestyle. There are special effects and sounds used throughout The Mockingjay. As much of the film involves combat style fighting, there are hovercrafts flying through the air, special weapons being used, and a large amount of explosives. In addition to the effects from the fighting, the music in the film sets the scene to a dark feel. There are several songs used in the film that would make you feel more suspenseful, or uneasy. The music suggests to the viewers that something dramatic is about to happen without using any dialogue. Lastly, the film is a thriller. It will leave you on the edge of your seat, anxious to see what will be waiting in Mockingjay Part 2. It involves romance, action, and even comedy. Regardless if you have read the books or not, the films are definitely worth watching.",8,0,7,21 March 2015
