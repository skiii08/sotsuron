Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," **Captain Jack Sparrow is back but not the others**
","The movie provides quite a nice dose of full-packed entertainment and overall the movie is good. But when compared to the last 3 parts it seriously lacks that *POTC* factor. Well its only Captain Jack Sparrow to be honest who has lived up to the expectation and Pirate Angelica also grabbed quite an attention from the spectators but rest of the crew somehow failed to impress, specially Barbossa in spite of being in the earlier parts. The new crew and members certainly could not make an impression on the viewers like the earlier crew. But in a nutshell the movie should be watched without comparing it with the other, then it would be quite an entertainer.",Null,0,1,24 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry ends Voldemort in Style.
",A MUST WATCH. Total entertainer with ample doses of heart-filled excitement. The suspense created in the 1st half is acutely executed with a brilliant end. Harry Potter Series really ends in style. This is one is certainly the best of the lot. Honestly being a crazy fan can't think of any negative points to this one. Maybe since the last part the time-line could have been a little longer something about 2hrs 30mins. The last part surely made me emotional. Perhaps it would have been little better if the character of Severus Snape could be given in a little more detail and maybe the final duel could have been a little fearsome. But the nonetheless THE MOVIE IS BRILLIANT.,10,0,2,15 July 2011
