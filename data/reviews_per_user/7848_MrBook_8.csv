Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Different from Vol 1., but still good.
","I keep hearing everyone bitch about how Vol. 2 was 'boring and didn't haveenough action.' It definitely does not have the amount of action as Vol. 1; but what it lacks it action, it makes up for in character development and dramatic tension. Watching the Pai Mei sequence, which I particularly enjoyed, showsthat Tarantino has watched a lot of the old HK flicks (the shooting style and the use of snap-zooms were perfectly mimicked). It would also seem that DavidCarradine is back on the 'cool list,' as Tarantino seems to do with many actor's (especially one's with the faltering careers). A very satisfying second half to the movie. 9/10",9,0,1,26 May 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Amazing Movie, Totally Heartbreaking
","Aside from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; this is one of the best movies I've seen in the last year (if not ever). This has already been placed on my top ten list. Never have I seen a movie so emotionally involving, that it takes your heart, and not only rips it out, but puts it in a blender and gives it back to you. Amazing performances by everyone in the cast (especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto). Never have I been so afraid of a refrigerator. This movie will make you want to never take ANY type of drugs again. They should show this to kids in school, not only as an educational tool towards drug use, but an example of a cinematic masterpeice.",10,0,0,28 January 2001
Scary Movie 2," Liked the first, but this was excruciatingly bad.
","I admit, I liked the first one. It had some clever jokes, and funny movie spoofs. But this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've haven't been this tempted to walk out of a theatre since I saw Batman & Robin. It was like the Wayans took all of the gross-out gags from the first one, and decided to make the sequel completely based around that. This time around, the cast is in a haunted house spoof, that consists of so many unfunny jokes, that you throw your arms up in the air saying 'what were they thinking?'. The humor in this movie is extremely desperate and contrived; even going as far as to spoof movies that aren't even horror movies. As my local newspaper said, Chris Elliot 'milked out every scene as much as he could without garnering a single laugh'. The only funny part of the movie was the Exorcist spoof (especially the party scene with Andy Richter playing the piano). After that, your waiting for the movie to be funny, until the halfway point when you just give up. For the remainder, your subjected to an annoying parrot that gets old really fast, Chris Elliots deformed hand, Anna Farris's very Jan Brady like disposition, recycled ejaculation jokes, and other very redundant examples of toilet humor. Don't get me wrong; I think toilet humor can be funny if it's done well. But this was just ridiculous. Worst movie this summer.",2,2,4,8 July 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Poetry in Motion
","I went to go see this movie with high expectations, and wasn't disappointed at all. I would have liked to have seen more development between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat, but other then that, it was a great movie. I see that many people don't like it because of the 'flying', and it could've been done very cheesy; but I've seen many Kung-Fu flicks and Ang Lee has pulled it off very beautifully. Characters soar and even fight with a grace that is very balletic in nature. I didn't find this movie boring at all, but very engrossing. I love movies that take me to 'another place' and that's exactly what this did. The fight between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh was amazing, the bamboo forest scene was hypnotic, and the score was haunting; I can't say enough. It makes me happy to see amazing action sequences combined into what's actually a very good character driven movie. Ang Lee has opened a whole new door to the American audience, and has redefined the typical martial arts flick. Amazing, beautiful movie.",9,0,0,28 January 2001
Hellboy," Coming from someone who has never read it, I was still disappointed.
","I thought the movie was very uneven. The story didn't flow very well, the action wasn't that great, most of the characters were too underdeveloped to care about, the emotional relationship stuff (with the exception of HB and Prof. Broom) was kind of cheesy, and despite being the coolest character in the movie, they didn't seem to do enough with Kroenen. Selma Blair was the worst thing about themovie. The love subplot was extremely dull. I guess I'm the exception because everyone seems to like this movie. At least it wasn't as bad as Daredevil. 6/10",Null,0,0,12 April 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I was pleasantly suprised! Great movie!
","I'm not a huge Tarantino fan but I do enjoy his movies. I just don't worship Pulp Fiction like everyone else does. Anyways, I got to see Kill Bil vol. 1, at a free screening and I was very impressed! I love old school Kung-Fu cinema, and this movie was a great throwback to the martial arts/ action movies of the 70's. I have more respect for Uma after seeing all the stuff that she had to go through for this movie. The cinematography was great, the action was cool, and all the actorsdid a great job of pulling it off. Some people claim this as the 'goriest movie ever,' but they obviously haven't seen Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive. Great movie 8/10.",9,0,1,19 April 2004
Mystic River," Not worth the glue that holds its Oscars together.
","I HATED this movie. The story was EXTREMELY contrived. The pacing was veryslow (could've had at least 30 minutes cut out). The cinematography was dull. Very Shakespearean and pointless character turns were made towards the endof the movie. Most of all, the performances were cartoonish AT BEST. If aperformance that consists of screaming is what earns an Oscar these days, then by all means, go for it. If you just won an award for looking doe-eyed, walking around slow, and talking like the Mayor in The Simpsons, then good for you. If anything, I appreciated the effort by Eastwood, but I really don't understand the praise that this movie is receiving. Overrated trash. 3/10",Null,0,0,12 April 2004
The Thin Red Line," Good thing going, but....
","the cinematography overkill killed it. This movie started out very well, was very philosophical and spiritual compared to Saving Private Ryan; but just went too long. I consider myself a patient moviegoer, but I kept expecting it to end. When I talk about the cinematography, don't get me wrong. It's some of the most beautiful, color-rich cinematography I've seen in any movie; but if they took out many of the shots of wildlife, and plants, the movie would've been a good 45 minutes shorter. Someday, I'll see it again, and see if my opinion changes.",6,2,4,28 January 2001
