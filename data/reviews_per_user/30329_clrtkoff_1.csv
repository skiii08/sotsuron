Source Code," Frustrating to watch
","This may have been a good film, but 48 minutes in and the main character still doesn't know what he's doing. 48 minutes of 'we're wasting time with all these questions, just find the bomber'. If they would just spend five minutes explaining it to him at the beginning they could've used the time in the movie to give it some actual content. It seems like a lazy way to fill the time and it's extremely frustrating. I'm ready to turn it off, but I'll finish it. Bottom line: it's frustrating, lazy, and full of time-wasting fluff instead of actual content.My advice? Pick a different film.",2,0,3,3 February 2013
