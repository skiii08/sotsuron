Sucker Punch," The Award for the Worst Movie Of All Time goes to...
","Well this has to be the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen many many films. The plot - nonsense, the way she enters this dream state every time she does some erotic dance beggars belief. The dreamstate is outrageous WWI soldiers, Dragons, life on other planets, suddenly futuristic.. none of it makes any sense. Its almost like they tried to cram in as many special effects as possible into those segments of the film to surround an otherwise poor script. Problem is as good as the special effects are it so unbelievable, in one scene Baby Doll throws a Map into the air to distract the enemy so they look up - during this scene Baby Doll's spice girls suddenly pop out from nowhere and annihilate the enemy. We then see the map still accelerating through the air at mach 5 or something and Baby Doll leaps into the air and catches it! Absolutely rubbish.Add the most depressing, emo-infested soundtrack into the mix and what you have here is the Worst Movie of All TIme.This is nothing I can say that is good about this movie, even the special effects are ridiculous at times with predictable 360deg rotations, 'that-would-never-happen moments' and over- done stop frame animation. Its almost as if they are trying to be artistic... but this ain't no picasso.Plot that doesn't make sense, confusing, terrible soundtrack, over-exaggerated special effects that quickly become lame and tiresome, not very entertaining at all... the list goes on.And to top this all off... at the end of the film some character that consistency appeared in her dreams appeared on screen driving a bus! WTF how does that make any sense!Some people say there are movies that are so bad that in fact they are good - Sucker Punch is not one of them - this is just bad bad bad.",1,9,17,24 November 2011
