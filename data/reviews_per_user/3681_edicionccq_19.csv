It," That Time When They Made 'It' the Perfect Dark Comedy.
","Yes, 'It (2017)' is a dark comedy. Nothing in this movie is scary except for a couple of unique effects, but you know that's fake as hell. I know, sometimes what is scary about a movie is the concept and how frighten it would be if that happens in real life. But you know you are never experiencing this in your life.The cast is full of junior kids and their all likeable. Every child possesses their personality very correctly defined and what frightens them is unique for all them. Their interactions with each other and as a team are what make this movie gold material in the dark comedy department. The jokes are always landed even when they don't seem to be intentional.The horror aspect is decent. The special effects are awesome, and they seem to really invest much work in making IT a great scary villain. The performance of Bill Skarsg√•rd is awesome; he absolutely looks like a monster and he embraces it.It is a dark comedy that you should see because it's humorous. Not so scary but at least it tries to be a decent horror film.",8,0,0,24 November 2019
Unbreakable," 'Unbreakable' is annoyingly slow but I like it!
","A few months before 'Glass' was premiered, I discovered 'Unbreakable' in Netflix. The plot was so good that I decided to give it a try.The movie is an interesting take in what I called 'Comic-book genre' because it has superheroes and villains in them. In this movie, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) starts wondering if he has super abilities after he is the only person to survive a train accident.Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson) will try to convince him he probably is a superhero.The story is actually magnificent. We follow David Dunn in his journey of self-discovering and trying to understand what's happening with her. Simultaneously, we see the problems that he encounters with his family because this is also a family drama.There's a lot to praise about this movie because what it achieves is extraordinary. Except for one slight thing, the pacing is slow as F*. This movie feels too long because it remains 106 minutes but almost 90% of the movie is the self-discovering process and the questioning everything about his life and just like 10% of the comic book action. But all of it is worthy with the ending twist that it's by far the second best of the franchise.",7,0,0,7 December 2019
Train to Busan," Train to Perfection.
","In a modern world full of movies about zombies, when someone makes a twist in the story, they could make something great. 'Train to Busan' is an example.I don't usually follow movies from Asian countries because they are not my cup of tea but this is in fact more than just that. The plot is reasonably simple but the twist in the story makes it better and unexpected. The chemistry between the father and daughter is lovely, and the rest of the characters include their unique storyline that affects the way things are going to develop.The special effects are impressive, and the acting is excellent. The ending is almost breathtaking. If you love zombies, this is an excellent movie of the genre.PS: I don't detest the idea of a 'Train to Busan' remake in America. I merely hope is good, it will still be unnecessary but pleasant.",10,2,3,22 November 2019
Us," What does this say about 'US'?
","'Us' is about racism. I'm joking; I will not make that joke twice. I genuinely don't understand what 'Us' is about.
'Us' is about a entertaining story that's ruined by the plot holes.
The plot is clever at the beginning when you are not thinking that much about why is happening the thing that is happening. But once the movie starts revealing their cards, you begin questioning every single thing and can't just deal with all that.
The acting is on point and if you ignore the plot holes it could attend an entertaining movie.",6,0,3,23 November 2019
The Irishman," What's the point of 'The Irishman'?
","Martin Scorsese is beloved for many people in the community. I'm not one of them. I watch the movie without thinking a lot of who direct that movie. I want to enjoy of the production like the final product, then I would care about who participate in his creation. But this time, it was impossible to not know who make this movie. Everybody was talking about who made 'The Irishman' because it seems like Martin Scorsese is a recognize director. I haven't watched any of his movies and after watching 'The Irishman' I don't want to neither.Martin Scorsese was the man who said the Marvel Movies weren't cine. So after the hype of this movie, I was expecting to see what cine really is. I was disappointed.The Irishman is a very well-made movie. It has good shots, great acting and good CGI to make his cast look younger. That's all the compliments I could give to this movie.The story in the Irishman is just boring. It seems like it will be something good and full of twists and emotions, that it will be a wild ride but I wasn't really moved for anything. This movie is so long, and it doesn't feel like it should have last that much. I didn't feel entertained. I was all the time expecting for this film to end because I never felt like it was going somewhere.I know Marvel movies aren't artistic or pretentious enough, but not a single person watch Marvel features with an intention to watch the next masterpiece of the decade. People watch Marvel flicks because they know they are going to be entertained. Even though their films are predictable and they don't risk a lot, they are entertaining. You watch Marvel movies because it doesn't pretend to be something that is not. 'The Irishman' pretends to be a masterpiece, art and one of the most amazing movies in the world. But you need to be entertaining too.",2,3,9,7 December 2019
BlacKkKlansman," I'm not racist but 'BlacKkKlansman' c'mon.
",I was expecting something good when I decided to regard this film. The plot is really appealing but the movie is so slow and doesn't develop in an compelling way.I enjoy Adam Driver's acting so much. He's the highlight of the movie in my opinion. But John David Washington felt flat for me. His character was boring and the actor didn't have enough charisma to make it better.I didn't feel like there was something at risk most of the time. I have watched some reviews that said they invented much stuff of the real events. I wish they added some action to make it more interesting.I'm giving it some starts for Adam Driver and the scene where he is almost interrogated about being Jewish. That's the best scene in the entire movie.,4,7,12,7 December 2019
Split," 'Split' Surprised Me!
","When I start watching 'Split, 'I had a different kind of story in my mind. I know it was connected with 'unbreakable' because after I watched that movie, I search if it has a sequel and this movie showed up. But I heard many stuff about this movie that I was expecting something very different.Even though what I had in my mind before I watched 'Split' was something different, 'Split' is amazing. James McAvoy is the best actor to this role, he and his character is clearly the highlight of the movie. He delivers every line and personality in a unique way.The story starts in a high note, but it has a slow pacing but at least you feel like there is some progress all the time, something that 'Unbreakable' lacks sense of direction. Anya Taylor-Joy and the other girls do a great job, overall Anya who is the second most important character in the film. She and her character are stunning and deliver a entertaining secondary story full of twists.The horror and action in this movie are unique. It doesn't need to be connected to Unbreakable to be successful, and M. Night Shyamalan recognized this but he still gave us a odd perfect sequel.",10,0,1,7 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood: Great actors with a poor fairy tale.
","Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a television star who has a career going downhills, and his stunt double/friend, Cliff Both (Brad Pitt) tries to help him with everything he asks. Meanwhile, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is living his best life in Hollywood.That's the plot. Don't expect anything else. This movie is a dramedy that should last half of what it actually does. 2 hours and 10 minutes of this movie are full of drama about how bad is Rick's career going. And showing us how he is a really good actor. On the other side of the story, we will see how Cliff is doing with his career that is also going downhill but he is hot so who cares. Meanwhile, Sharon Tate is just there for people to see how gorgeous Margot Robbie is, also to make us love her in case she's killed by the Manson family, you already know what really happens.I didn't like this movie, but I didn't hate it either. Allow me to explain myself; I wanted to like this movie because I love the Sharon Tate case. Also, I think that Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio are amazing actors. And they were pretty good. Leonardo DiCaprio carries the whole movie; I love most of his scenes, he's charming and it makes you love him. Even when the story is boring, you really want to see what Leonardo DiCaprio is going to do next.Brad Pitt has a great scene, and it's the Bruce Lee scene. That scene alone is the second best thing in the whole movie. But that's it with Brad Pitt's character. He has a scene in Rancho Spahn that is superficially tense but I actually find it quite useless.The ending is whole other level. It's full of action, and it has been so far the best of the whole movie. But it feels like another movie so I don't know. I would like having more scenes like that in this movie.This movie gets 5 out of 10 because it's so slow and boring sometimes but the acting is so great that saves the movie.",5,2,2,21 December 2019
Get Out," 'Get Out' Brings Out Commentary about Racism.
","'Get Out' is about racism. I know this statement is groundbreaking, but I would say it anyway. I, a white guy, have watch thousands of movies about this topic so I recognize what I talk about when I talk about racism.Of course I'm joking. I don't know a lot about racism but is unnecessary to watch this movie, is a really entertaining movie even if you don't get the social commentary in the story.The acting is on point. The twist are unexpected and the last 40 minutes are worthy of all your money. So go ahead and give it a try, it's a decent movie.Oh but before you watch it, be aware this isn't a horror movie that will frighten you with jumpscares, it's more like a dramedy with thriller. It's unscary is what I'm trying to say.",8,0,3,22 November 2019
Aladdin," Aladd√≠n is Back. Now in Live Action.
","I didn't watch Aladdin, but I did recognize what the movie was about. I regard a couple of scenes on the internet. Therefore, I was excited to watch this movie because people said it was a good adaptation. Everyone was lying.Allow me to explain myself. Minor spoilers.
This movie is boring. The visuals are great because it's visible they expend many budgets to this movie but it is not so magical. I regard a couple of scenes from the original movie like the scene with Jazmin trapped in the hourglass and the massive fight against Jafar. SPOILER. This doesn't happen in this movie. Jafar isn't an absolute evil; he is a hot villain but is not threating at all and the visuals are not half as good as the original movie.
If you are not going to go big with the magic aspect in this movie, then don't re-make it. It doesn't offer anything new except for the Jamzin's actually good song. So don't expect much of this remake.",3,0,1,21 November 2019
The Lion King," The Lion King is Back. Now in Live Action
","I expected that maybe because I didn't watch the original movie, I would naturally love this remake but the harsh truth is that's not the case.
The visuals are great and... That's it. The movie doesn't have much to offer.
The characters are quite blank; it lacks of emotions. Some songs are enjoyable but some are decent none less. I was disappointed because even though everything looks so realistic, everything seems so irrealistic and it doesn't achieve you experience something.
In conclusion, some stories don't translate properly from animation to 'Live Action.'",3,0,3,21 November 2019
Hidden Figures," Hidden Figures: Talent doesn't look gender or race.
","In the 60's, three African American women were trying to make a change in their lives. Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) helps Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) to make history in the U.S. Space Program. Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) tries finding a way to maintain his group employable when technology seems to be close to does their jobs, and finally Mary Jackson (Janelle Mon√°e) pursues her dreams against every odd to become an engineer.This movie starts great. It has heart, and it has a great cast full of great actors. Every character has a personality that differentiates from others, and they set their motivations. But the movie starts to fell flat halfway through it.My interest at the beginning of the movie was really high, and I like every character but then at the middle of the movie I start to lose focus. I think is predictable what's going to happen and they don't try hiding it. It's a simple good movie that demonstrates how these women have to work twice as hard as anyone else to be noticed as equals. It doesn't intent to be more than that. The message is clear but they should have more focus on that in the middle of the second act.This movie gets 7 out of 10 because it has heart, talented cast and an incredible story. But it isn't as good as it promise to be in the first act of the movie.",7,2,4,21 December 2019
Midsommar," Beautiful image but boring story
","Hereditary was considered one of the most amazing movies of the last year. I thought it was boring and pretentious but at least it tries to be something original, also the story was good in so many ways and it wasn't so predictable. But that's not the case with this movie. Midsommar has a very good start, I honestly thought it was going to be good because starts really well. But after a couple of minutes it become pretty boring and it makes you want to sleep.
My interest starts to appear again in a death scene for how graphic and violent it is but honestly is only downhills from there. The story becomes so predictable and you just want some gore scenes or something that makes you get traumatized as much people says but that's not going to happen.
I'm going to give this movie 3 stars for:
1. Three good deaths
2. The visuals are on point
3. I recognized some actors",2,14,22,20 October 2019
La La Land," A lovely movie
","Finally I had the chance to watch this movie. I usually don't enjoy a lot of the movies that are nominated for the Oscars because they usually are too long and visually perfect but they don't make me feel something.La La Land manages to be perfect in every single aspect. The visuals are awesome, the music is so good, and the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone is so perfect that it makes me root for them.",10,5,5,10 November 2019
Joker," JOKER IT'S JUST EPIC
",I'm not a big fan of comics. But I am fan of everything around the pop culture that superheroes are. So I know a couple of things about Gotham and Batman.My hype for this movie was because it's proclaimed as very violent and talks about mental issues. I love characters with mental health problems so watching this was awesome. The Joker it's the first movie with a low pacing and obviously not commercial that I would say it's my favorite of all times.The third act of this movie it's golden. No spoilers but the ending left me shaking.,10,3,5,20 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Is enough of 'It: Chapter Two'?
","This was always arranged as a two movies saga. So this is the end of It, and it doesn't live to the expectations.Allow me to explain myself.The first movie was the perfect dark comedy and you might believe that may be it wasn't risky enough because the cast was full of kids and they were all destined to survive for the sequel. So they make a good choice focusing more on the comedy on the first movie and then the sequel will be more dark and scary.You were incorrect. This movie isn't scary again. It's a horror dark dramedy and is monotonous as you don't have any idea.The first act of the movie is all of the characters being invited to come back to the town where everything happens on the first movie, so you have to observe their reactions to the invitation. I wouldn't consider this as a spoiler because it's something that everybody recognizes is going to happen. Over here are the spoilers of the formatTHE SPOILER BEGINS - The second act is they collecting the things they need to defeat Pennywise but everybody has to go alone in their quest. The format is: First they go to one place, then they will have a memory of when they were kids that explains why that object is so meaningful for them. When they get the object, they probably will see pennywise and all their fears seem to be coming true. - THE END OF THE SPOILER.The second act is so repetitive and slow that causes you feel like this movie could last just two hours without the filler. The ending is pretty satisfactory, they are deaths that will make you cry and the message is excellent for the movie. It's another pleasant dark comedy but it's just too long.",7,0,1,24 November 2019
Parasite," PARASITE: OUTSTANDING.
","PROS:EVERY SINGLE THING.The acting is great. The pacing is amazing, it always feels like something is happening and you won't get bored. The message isn't scream out at the audience, you need to read between the lines.
The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.CONS:Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying. But read some reviews and probably you would understand what's the message behind the ending.",10,31,52,3 January 2020
Marriage Story," MARRIAGE STORY: Two extraordinary actors can make a boring premise something great.
","Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are going through a hard divorce when Nicole decides she wants to stay in L.A. but Charlie doesn't want to leave NYC. Charlie and Nicole both want something, and it's the best for their son Henry (Azhy Robertson).I want it to see this movie even though I find it quite pretentious and I usually don't enjoy movies called Oscar worthy. The premise of the movie also seems pretty boring, a movie about a couple experiencing a divorce but watching both sides of view without antagonizing any of the parts involved... Unusually, it sounds good but not really that entertaining to last more than two hours.I was so wrong. This is one of the best movies of the year. Everything in the technical aspect is perfect, the director knew what he was attempting to achieve and it did it amazingly. Not a single second in this movie doesn't look amazing. But that's not what I treasure about the movie.The acting is absolutely incredible. Some scenes are pretty long and I find myself surprised how Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver can deliver those amazing performances. I cried in four scenes, and I was always expecting what would happen next. The script is brilliant; they cause you to empathize with both characters even though they both have issues and weaknesses.I totally recommend this movie. It's full of heart in every aspect.",10,8,12,27 December 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Kingsman The Secret Service: How action and comedy should be combined
","Colin Firth, Taron Egerton and Samuel L. Jackson, they are part of the cast of 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' an excellent movie about Eggsy, a young street man, who is recruited by the secret service called Kingsman, but before Eggsy can be a Kingsman, he would have to survive an extreme training program. Simultaneously, an evil tech man is working in something that could alter the world for worse.The cast is outstanding, and the acting is on point, something expected when you have Samuel L. Jackson as a part of it. Every character is excellent. You can root for the spies but at the same time you don't hate the villains, you hate the villains' plan but not them because they are also funny and smart.The story is a little bit a clich√©. It's a formula about a character being trained to be part of something great and then try to stop a villain to prove he deserves to be part of the group. It is predictable in some aspects, but it's actually really good, the pacing and the jokes make it enjoyable. This movie has some twists that make the story even better.
My conclusion is this movie is an excellent start to a franchise. It's so funny you will laugh in every scene or most of them but at the same time it has absolutely good action scenes. It's bloody funny, give it a try, I'm convinced that you will like it.",10,2,2,12 December 2019
