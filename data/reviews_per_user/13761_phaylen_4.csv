10 Cloverfield Lane," Mind blowing, heart pounding, White knuckle Ride
","I'm a film snob, and admit I didn't expect much from this after being so disappointed in it's predecessor. I couldn't have been more wrong.Easily, this is the best psychological thriller to come along in in years. John Goodman is a absolute genius, and his performance rivals even the most iconic ones in modern cinema. I am not typically reactive to films, given that I've seen the goriest of the gory and am resistant to the shock scare tactic that lesser films leverage to make you jump.That didn't happen here. This film leveraged your emotions.This film gave me anxiety, it had me literally nervous. Very rarely does a film come along with such a great concept that it leaves the viewer incapable of predicting the results or consequences, but this hit the mark on every single level. It entertained, provoked a reaction, and had me completely invested from beginning to end.THIS is what filmmaking is about. This shows that Hollywood is still capable of original concepts and clever stories rather than just recycling comic book superheroes over and over again. In a better world, John Goodman would get an Oscar for his gripping performance because there hasn't been anyone come close to the talent he demonstrated throughout. Never boring, always unfolding, this was simply masterful cinema.",10,5,9,26 March 2016
Brokeback Mountain," 'Brokeback' not all it's cracked up to be
","I was one of those people anxiously awaiting this film that has been critically lauded since before it's release. I listened with great anticipation as people in various internet/news/magazine forums raved about how important and inspirational this film was. It won SAG awards, Golden Globes, Director's Guild Awards, and is the front runner for this years Best Picture Oscar. Finally, I saw 'Brokeback Mountain.'Now, it's time to be honest, to cut right into the bone and leave the meat for the industry hype machines. What was supposed to be one of the most profound love stories of our time was everything but. The pacing was so proposterously slow that I nearly fell asleep in the first hour. Sometimes, 15 minutes of screen time would pass with only three words of dialog. The atmosphere Ang lee set up is unmistakably his signature, sweeing mountains, mists in the forests, the feeling of remoteness. Intentional, I'm certain. While the performances in this film were stellar, it boils down to this; The story was benign. Truly the most vacant story I've seen in years. Far to quiet to maintain any true cinematic value, with the exception of the aforementioned cinematography. The powerful love story hailed worldwide is actually not at all absorbing, but makes you feel more sympathetic to the women in their lives that they are uniformly deceiving. The focus was not at all on the male protagonists, but how they adapted to mundane lives away from Brokeback Mountain...I expected to be moved beyond measure, in fact, I was bored, emotionally detached, even a little depressed by the ending, which was so anticlimactic that it failed to serve any real emotional impact except the traditional 'awww...'I believe now, after experiencing 'Brokeback Mountain' that this IS an important film only in that it spotlights the very real repression many gays suffer with even today. If homosexuality were not the centerpiece of this film, it would never have been made specifically because of the dry, dull nature of it. 'Brokeback' should be regarded as a statement film. Thats what it set out to do, and thats what it has accomplished, much in the same way 'Schindler's List' (a far better film) portrayed the Jewish tragedies during the Holocaust. Because of these statements alone we celebrate like these.. In Brokeback's case-not because they are exempliry of cinematic greatness, but because they encourage a progressive mentality, and promote a little more social understanding.",4,10,53,24 January 2006
2012," What Entertainment is About
","2012 was one of the most sophisticated, high concept speculative pieces of film making in recent years. Big budget 'Event' films are always panned by critics because they have garnered a stigma for lacking substance and relying on special effects to rake in the box office dough. Sometimes this is true. In the case of 2012, however, it is absolutely false. It reminded me, as someone who hasn't been to the movies in a couple of years (I tend to be indifferent to recent titles and wait for the DVD)what entertainment is about. It reminded me that films don't have to be super-serious art house dramas to be enjoyed - or at least to be confident in admitting We enjoyed it.I spent a roller coaster ride in a darkened theater for over two hours. It was intense, thrilling, emotional, and SHOCKER - it even compelled the audience to think. 2012 never tries to pretend it is anything more than exactly what it is - An adventure thriller that speculates the end of the world. It introduces us to relevant characters so the story is not simply one special effect after another. You develop an investment in their plight - rarely do big budget films allow you to make that connection with fully realized characters.This is more than just a disaster film of epic magnitude: Although Roland Emmerich has rightfully earned the title 'The Master Of Disaster.' It is the perfect film to lose yourself in for awhile, and leaves you with great tabletop conversation afterward. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys great character driven films with high octane visual spectacles!",10,10,26,21 November 2009
Warcraft," This Will Surpass Your Expectations!
","First, a couple things about me... I'm old. I played the MMO on it's first night of release in 2004. I'm jaded. Especially when it comes to video adaptations. I'm skeptical of gratuitous CGI.Warcraft managed to turn every one of my preconceived notions around on me. I went to see it out of pure nostalgia. Let's see how they completely obliterate this. It happened to so many video game adaptations that should never have been made, I had no reason to believe this was any different.I walked out of the theater and literally said out loud, 'That was excellent!' Sure I haven't played the video games in over ten years now, and my friend who accompanied me had never played any Warcraft games at all, yet that didn't interfere with his enjoyment of the film at all.If you're a Warcraft fan, every element of this film is a loyal nod to the original material; From the bricks in the buildings and familiar landmarks of Azeroth, to the over-sized armor and even the musical score was beautifully composed in that iconic WoW style.For once, CGI is used properly: To give the characters and creatures that distinctive look. It's never distracting! Which is amazing! Because I am so tired of these 200 million dollar movies using CGI just to say 'Look at me! I have 200 Million dollars!' I have so much respect for the filmmakers who opted to use CGI to bring the characters to life rather than give us a shoddy substitute with big explosions.I walked out absolutely delighted with the film. It had a cohesive storyline; Well defined characters that are faithful to the original context they are adapted from, and the visuals are used in masterful ways that will leave you in awe. Don't let a lack of familiarity with Warcraft stop you from seeing this film. It stands on it's own merits and is the perfect introduction to that universe and legacy that has been so successfully created over the last two decades.If you are familiar with the film, I leave you with something that made me laugh out loud in the theater with absolutely stupid joy: Keep and eye out for the Murloc!!Bluhrglelerglelurglelurgle!",9,8,15,25 June 2016
