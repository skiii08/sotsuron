The Devil's Advocate," A MUST SEE!!
","What an AMAZING movie. The concept it simple and still so full of layers and twists. Al Pacino is at his best!! He's funny, intense, serious and his presence in the movie just gives you chills. Keanu and Charlize are wonderful together. Their chemistry is undeniably magical and they are just so incredible. This movie is INCREDIBLE!! I LOVE IT!!!",10,0,0,7 January 2020
Sucker Punch," I LOVED IT!!
","I couldn't believe the reviews were so bad. The fight scenes and music were intense, the girls and the Wise Man are AWESOME and the message is cool. I loved it!!",8,10,13,15 December 2019
A Star Is Born," Rated all for the acting.
","Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga and Sam Elliot were PHENOMENAL in the roles!! The story, not so much. It felt so erratic and jumbled. I am happy to have seen it for the sake of the actors because I LOVE them, but they deserved a better story line.",5,0,3,22 October 2018
Get Out," Wasted my time
","I...don't...get it. I had high hope's to find out what was going on with these rich white folks. When it was finally revealed what was going, all I could think was, HUH??!! I thought it was just downright moronic. I did think the racial barriers the movie tried to overcome (interracial relationships, treating others with respect no matter what race they are, etc.) was commendable but it wasn't enough to save the film. That was a big let down for a horror fan who was looking forward to this movie.",1,8,14,17 March 2019
Green Book," Will become a classic
","Years from now, when I'm old and feeble this will be one movie that I will recall with fond memories. It will go down in history with classic movies like Forest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption and It's A Wonderful Life. Not only is the movie funny and heart warming, it teaches you a valuable lesson about very different people coming together in very different and unexpected ways despite their differences. Not only that, but it has lovely and incredible music. IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!!",10,1,2,8 March 2020
