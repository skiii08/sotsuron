Marie Antoinette," Converse goes in one scene - goof or on purpose?
","In the scene where Marie Antoinette is going through her shoes while preparing for a big party you see a pair of Converse All Star 1923 Chuck Taylor basketball shoes for about one and a half seconds. The shoes is seen together with lots of shoes from the time era. Its an anachronism. But the question is...Did Coppola put the Converse shoes there on purpose (which I think she did) or is it a goof? Does anyone know?By the way, the film is really really good! Kirsten Dunst is fantastic as Marie Antoinette. And the cool music from the 80s brings life to the film. I think the soundtrack will be fantastic.",8,2,10,12 September 2006
