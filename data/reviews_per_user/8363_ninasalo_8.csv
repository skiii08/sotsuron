The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk
",I didnt like it as much as the film before but it was OK. The near 2 hour run time doesnt do justice either and it can be a little bit boring in some parts. Edward Norton is a great cast for the lead and gives a good performance. I think they relied far too much on effects instead of story behind it!,5,0,0,4 May 2018
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 is bad
","Tony Stark spent about 15 minutes total wearing the suit. Marvel needs to stop letting the actors walk over them with the I WANT PEOPLE TO SEE MY FACE thing. 
 This movie was called Iron Man. If i want to see some guy using gardening gloves modded with junk he got at Home Depot I watch HOME DEPOT MODDED GARDENING GLOVES MAN. The only reason i gave this 1 and not a zero is beacuse a honor of being the worst movie ever goes to Batman & Robin.",1,1,4,1 May 2018
Iron Man 2," Iron man 2
","I found this film so highly disappointing. When i saw the first Iron Man i was blown away by it. It was epic, action packed adventure. Which included an excellent easy to follow script and great entertaining story. One of the best super hero movies of all time!!!!!!!!!! But this movie SUCKS !!!!!!!!!!!",4,0,2,4 May 2018
Batman Returns," Very Good Movie!
","While its still doesnt remain as good as the first one or the dark knight, this is still a great sequel to the first batman movie. While it does to feel like it focuses on its villians, batman still gets enough credit to be one of the greatest super heroes ever!",9,0,13,1 May 2018
Batman Begins," Batman Begins
","One of the most fantastic parts of Batman Begins is how complex the film is. Nolan is not primarily concerned on making a entertaining comic book pic, but rather on making a intriguing art house character drama. The number of deep and thought provoking themes brought up in movie is something to be hold, considering how the campy Adam West version introduced many people to the character",10,2,2,1 May 2018
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight
","This super hero movie is a rare film that drills deep inside the character and the script more than the action. It may be boring to a few people who despite waiting for 2 hrs; however i promise you, Heath Ledger will keep you amazed the whole time. Ultimately, Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is a masterpiece, a film that doesnt just show off the visuals and action, but understands what deep pains and afflictions a superhero suffers.",10,0,0,2 May 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","I liked this movie. But the problem is i wanted to LOVE this movie. There where just so many small plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the film that kept creeping in and jarring me out of the experience as well as several secondary characters that really served no purpose at all. I would list them out but i wont to avoid spoilers. All in all, this felt kind of sloppy for a Christopher Nolan movie.",7,0,1,2 May 2018
Iron Man," Iron Man
","I have never cared for RDJ as an actor and the current comic version of Iron Man is an unlikeable fascist dick so i had zero expectations going into this movie. I only saw it because i had eight bucks to spend and two hours to kill. Coming out of the movie, I brought another ticket because i would have been ripping the theater off if i had only paid full price for it. This is standard by which all future Marvel Movies will be judged. I simply cannot praise this movie enough. Its as good as Batman Begins but LIGHTER and more suitable for children and it has enough sly humor that the adults will be entertained as well. RDJ gives the performance of lifetime in the role he has born to play. I have seen this movie six times now and im going back to see it again!!!!!!!!",9,0,0,4 May 2018
