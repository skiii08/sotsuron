United 93," what a load of rubbish!!!
","hey you guys who have commented on this movie, and given it amazing reviews on how touching and moving it was... sure... if it really happened that way! its total rubbish.. flight 93 landed at Cleveland airport - safely- I agree what happened to the passengers is truly sad.. but also unanswered..please watch the documentary called-- loose change-- it explains everything.. you can download it on limewire its truly amazing.. for instance.. the calls that were made by the loved ones... at 30.000 feet.. even at 5.000 feet.. cell phones wouldn't work!",1,16,53,4 June 2006
No Country for Old Men," Great until the last half hour
","Well, I am a Coen fan for sure , and had to make sure I got to see this movie on day 1 of release. And for the the most part i was pleased, well shot, well thought out, character development was amazing, acting superb. But here were the problems.The last half hour was a disappointment and it went downhill Needed editing i.e. tommy lees scene at his friends house were not needed. By that stage in the movie why? And the end , It was a major disappointment.. Usually the coen movies stay with me for a while after. But this one just annoyed me. I know this movie should be up for Oscars. for acting/cinematography but it wont win best movie for sure.",10,18,39,10 November 2007
District 9," not bad
","firstly this movie does not deserve it 9+ marks out of 10. It started off bad. it was boring, I was cringing through the whole first 35 mins. he parallels to racial apartheid aren't exactly subtle, the acting was bad too, esp the lead actor. it uses this faux documentary style that is so clich√©. It was just disappointing, shame really. wait to see it on cable or DVD.It's mainly a compost of other sci-fi movies, as old as 'RoboCop,' 'Aliens' and 'The Fly' and as recent as 'Cloverfield' and 'Transformers.' It's a bad joke that 'District 9' will be hailed for its 'originality.' The movie's main fun comes from wondering what coin of the pop realm Blomkamp will pluck out from his memory bank next.",6,3,9,16 August 2009
Transformers," Much too long!
",this started out well.. good effects.. funny...and it kept me and my friend interested..but .. i must add.. this was much too long.. we all got bored.. and also the silly sentimental stuff was too much.. it started to make us laugh for the wrong reasons.. t he good points.. acting was flawless.. effects.. visually very good.i would say stay for the first half..and you've pretty much seen the best of it.I would wait for the DVD < i guess there will be transformers 2 and 3 and ....,4,2,6,15 July 2007
