Insidious: Chapter 2," Rather dull
","Was rather dull.. Wasn't scary, the only part that was at all 'jumpy' was the title screen that was unnecessarily loud and rather pointless in my opinion. The film didn't really pull me in and I found myself losing concentration waiting for something a little bit remotely exciting or scary to happen. Sadly disappointed. I believe that this film had a lot of potential having enjoyed the first one, however again I was sadly disappointed. The best bits of the films was when someone thought it was scary and ran out the screening and when it ended. Wouldn't recommended at all!",1,13,25,10 December 2013
Frozen," Surprisingly rather good.
","Having went into this movie not really expecting anything from it as i chose it to just pass the time. I must say I was rather taken a back at how enjoyable this movie actually was! Personally I found it had a little bit to much singing and not enough reindeer! Personally my favourite characters where the snowman and reindeer! But that is besides the point, the movie was very pleasant to watch and I think you actually felt something for the characters which is rather nice for a animated movie. Bits where funny, bits where sad, bits where happy and I feel it had the perfect balance for all. Highly recommended it both children and adults a like!",8,1,3,10 December 2013
