50 First Dates," It was a good time pass! and time pass only
","This is a sort of movie that can make you switch-off TV. It is a mediocre type of movie. There is no wit, no thrill, no romantic scenes; nothing but a novel love story about a man who falls in love to a girl in a restaurant. That girl happens to have lost his memory and only can remember things of a day and that too for the same day.So the boy has to introduce himself to her daily.There is not much that this movie offers. Not very well acted either. Though Barrymore was good.There is not much that this movie offers. Not very well acted either. Though Barrymore was good.",6,0,0,13 August 2006
Pearl Harbor," Apart from controversy it is an excellent movie!
","I was surprised to find out that this movie is not in IMDb top 250 list. More astonishing thing is that many of the people are giving it rating 1. Come on people! the movie at least deserves better. I accept that the history it depicts may be inexact, the story moves slowly, the love story is sappy but apart from those things it was good overall. People who do not have seen this movie Don't listen the people who say this movie is a crap. Listen what argument they give for its being crap. All of them are getting emotional. If u see through all of the hundreds of Comments written here you will find that most of the US citizens and some UK citizens are giving it bad rating. That is because they think their history is distorted or they have seen enough of WW movies. This movie deserves that you see it yourself and then decide which side you are in.",8,2,3,16 August 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Every second of this movie is spectacular.
",I liked this movie when I first time watched it but it was never my 'the best' movie. Then I happened to watch it again and ever since it is by far the most enjoyable movie i have seen.Andy(Tim Robbins) is a true social spirit. It was after Andy's(Tim Robbins) hundreds of letters that was sent to the authorities requesting funds for the prison's library that they at lastcsent the fund with the words 'Please stop sending us letters'. He teaches a fellow inmate to get degree. It was the same student who told Andy about a man he knew who has killed Andy's wife (for this crime Andy was in the Shawshank Prison). The Warden could not let Andy go as he was his key to financial success. From that moment Andy was committed to take revenge. And he did it.Every second of this movie is spectacular. It is the best movie I have ever seen and heard of! Enjoy every word of it!,10,0,0,16 August 2006
