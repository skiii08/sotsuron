The Avengers," Big Audience, Small Impression
","The Avengers by Marvel received high ratings from several movie sources and although the film attracted audiences, it didn't leave the audience with an impression. If you want a simple, action-oriented flick with decent characters, laughs, good cinematography, and some small levels of character transformation, this is the movie for you. However, if you are looking for something that speaks to your soul, entertains, shocks, and leaves you with an unyielding catharsis, then forget about it. The Avengers was rated in three fields; cinematography, story structure (plot & theme), and characterization. Of these, it ranked highest in cinematography and store structure, although it ranked fairly evenly in all three â€“ a balanced and organized film. However, it lack focus and import regarding the theme, and the plethora of characters makes it difficult for the audience to connect with their trials. Consequently, when Iron Man undergoes his ordeal, the audience feels disconnected and cannot experience the catharsis intended. Overall, it was a good film with good acting, organization, and appeal, but when it comes down greatness, it doesn't fit the bill.",7,4,12,2 June 2012
Rio," Vibrant but Tasteless
","Rio is a vibrant, fun movie that will entertain both children and adults with its humor and spontaneity. In order to save his species, a flightless blue macaw and his keeper must spread their wings and journey to Rio do Janiero trailed by a ring of international bird smugglers. The main characters, a bird named Blue and Linda, his bookish owner, are both flightless in the sense that they choose not to explore beyond what they know. That is, until they discover that Blue is the last male of his species. Nothing forces them out of their comfortable lives except their sudden desire to help save Blue's species. The plot and themes are strong, making it functional and enjoyable to the audience, although it strongly lacks in characterization. Both Blue, Linda, and the entourage of secondary characters are either stock characters or merely flat. Additionally, the movie twists its positive theme of 'have the courage to be yourself' into a negative morale of 'being yourself is doing whatever feels good.' It also has a secondary environmental theme. This theme is enforced by lyrics sung by cute birds singing, 'I just want to live my life to party' and other similar tag lines. We repeatedly see birds and people dancing at Marti Gras and exploring being themselves by getting loose, partying, and learning to love others by being reckless instead of selfless. Not child friendly themes in my opinion. The movie also exhibits completely flat villains, no mystery, no true conflict (no impossible goal). It's a comedy only film with a strong theme and plot but no real substance.",4,3,4,2 June 2012
