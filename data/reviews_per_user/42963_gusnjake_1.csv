The Blair Witch Project," Follow The Stupid Creek
","I can't believe how many people were suckered in to this bland, boring, over-hyped joke.  It is easy to see that these morons were city kids, anyone who has spent any time camping knows to follow the creek.The only thing that was a bigger non-event then Blair Witch was the Y2K scare.  This was not a good movie, it was a giant hoax perpetrated by the film makers who are laughing at all the people gullible enough to have fallen for it.",Null,0,1,22 February 2000
