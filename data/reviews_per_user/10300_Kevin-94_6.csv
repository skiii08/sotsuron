Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Weak
","Some thoughts on Phantom Menace.1. The main thing missing from all the prequels was a sense of emotional connections between the characters. Take Obi Wan. He spends the three prequels performing his various duties as a jedi. What are his hopes? Dreams? Fears? Loves? He has no emotional agenda and no real emotional connection to the other characters. It's true of all the prequel characters, who seem to exist in their own solitary worlds, disconnected from others.Remember the original Star Wars? Remember Luke and Han, bickering like brothers but helping each other when in need? Remember Luke's father/son like connection to Obi Wan, and the sense of loss he felt when Obi Wan died? Remember the droids, arguing but never less than loyal to each other? That was how Lucas wrote then. Today, I always imagine George sitting in some big mansion, like Charles Foster Kane, rich and very much alone. His movies are emotionally cold and the characters are all estranged from each other.2. I'll never understand why Lucas chose trade routes and tariffs as central aspects of his adventure movie plot. Was he sitting in his office one day, arranging for a shipment of Star Wars toys to China, and was upset about tariffs and thought 'Here's an underutilized idea for an adventure movie.' Or maybe he didn't realize that business trade negotiations, although perhaps relateable to him, weren't relateable to a large segment of his audience.3. Making the force a chemical in your blood rather than a mystical ephemeral power robs the force of a lot of its mystery and fascination. It makes the force mundane. Another thought: Since the prequels take place 'before' the originals, how come nobody in the Star Wars/Empire/Jedi films seems aware of this blood thing? 4. It's interesting to have Luke be Vader's son and Leia's brother, but having C3PO be Vader's pet robot as a child seems a little too coincidental.5. Annikan is a dull kid and his force powers are never really demonstrated. Remember in the first Spider-Man, when Peter Parker was trying out his new powers? He was fascinated and curious and horrified all at once. Annikan should have had a scene like that.6. Why didn't they bring Annikan's mother along with them? He's a boy and presumably will need a nanny, right? Why can't she be that? It might have been interesting to kill her off. That would give Annakin an early trauma, one that would inform his later dark side conversion. It would also form an interesting corollary with the first Star Wars film, where the death of Luke's aunt and uncle caused him to leave his farm life for a world of adventure.7. Science fiction writer David Brin wrote a piece for Salon magazine years ago that articulated a lot of basic flaws of 'Phantom Menace.' Be sure to check it out for an intelligent, thoughtful analysis (some of which I've reiterated here.)",4,0,1,12 August 2008
Star Trek Into Darkness," BOLDLY GOINGÂ… backwards, not forwards.
","It was understandable that the first film of the new 'Trek' franchise would evoke, to some degree, the originals. That film was a transitional film, a bridge from old to new. And having accomplished that, I was hoping that 'Star Trek Into Darkness' would carve out its own ideas, stake its own claim and justify itself as a fresh take on the 'Trek' conventions (no, not those conventions).Instead, if anything, this film is even more reliant on past story ideas than the first film was. And in the final analysis, 'Star Trek: Into Darkness' can best be characterized as a remake of the classic 1982 film 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.' And why do that? For over thirty years, that film has been available to anyone who wanted it. 'Star Trek 2' is the best Trek film ever. It has a wonderful blend of action, character and original science fiction ideas. It also has enormous heart and interesting themes about aging, death and the costs of maturity. This film evokes the basic outline but none of what made that film great.In interviews, the filmmakers refused to say the identity of the character played (very well) by Benedict Cumberbach, but said it was a famous Trek villain. It's a short list: Harry Mudd (who gets a shout out here), Q and Khan. At first, I thought it might be Q. Cumberbach more closely evokes John DeLancie than Ricardo Montalban. And that would be a neat surprise, since everyone in the audience would be assuming Khan. (And the fact that Q is not part of the Kirk 'Trek' universe would be a neat surprise too.) It couldn't be Khan, I thought to myself. That was just be too obvious. Surely, the filmmakers have something far more interesting up their sleeve.Alas, just as smoke is indicative of fire, the revelation that the villain is Khan falls entirely flat. It's about a surprising as the revelation in 'Indy 4' of who Mutt's father was.Cumberbatch is fun in his way, but I wished the writers had given him more to do, other than arch his eyebrows and speak the usual bad guy rantings in his melodious British voice. Montalban's Khan was a Shakespearian figure. He was angry, funny, sexy, soulful and, in the end, totally crazy and sadly tragic. (Nicholas Meyer, the film's director and co-writer was a Shakespearian scholar.) Cumberbatch is a cool actor but his villain is too one note, in the end, to register much.As the film goes on, the references to 'Star Trek II' pile on and on, until it becomes clear that this film is pretty much a straight up remake. There are some vague attempts to inject some fresh variations. (It's Kirk, not Spock who risks his life, etc.) But disappointment sets in as time goes on and the film fails to evoke any fresh ideas. The pile up of references and shout outs made me feel like I was watching a 'Simpsons' Halloween episode parody. Spock's pained 'Khaaaan!!' lament was the jump the shark moment, and it drew huge laughs at the screening I attended.I enjoyed the film's action sequences, but I'm hoping that future 'Trek' films will dial down the homage to the originals, and dial up the new and original ideas. The time has come to stop recycling and start creating. For a franchise that boldly boasts of 'new frontiers,' this chapter is sadly derivative.",6,3,7,2 June 2013
American Beauty," Grow up, Lester!
","Dear Lester Burnam:  I was sorry to hear of your death, mainly because I was very curious to see how your experiment would have ended.  You blackmailed your employer for a year's salary.  Had you not suddenly died, what were you planning to do?  Maybe someone will one day write a 'sequel' to your story, one set in a parallel universe where you didn't die, and after the money ran out, you had to decide what to do next.  It's not surprising you've come to the conclusion that old=bad, teen=good. All the grown ups around you are fools.  All the teens are wise and kind.  The only real problems the kids have are their loser parents.  Lester, the critics talked about how you chose to purge your life of what is 'bad' and get in touch with what really mattered. They were wrong.  You criticize your wife for loving a couch, but a moment earlier, you told her you 'ruled' because you bought a classic car.  I couldn't help but notice that what was 'bad' was invariably grown up, while what was 'good' was invariably youthful. You drift away from your wife and focus on a teenage girl.  You give up your mature, responsible job to work at a fast food place.  You buy the car you wanted to have as a kid.  Lester, the critics have it all wrong.  You're not 'improving' your life, you're infantalizing it.  You're turning your back on grown up life and trying to act like a kid.  Lester, you are not alone in your youth obsession.  Years ago, teenagers went to movies and watched with fascination as grown ups like Cary Grant and Grace Kelly fell in love.  Today, people in their forties watch 'Dawson's Creek' and 'Titanic.'    It's a new world, one where being a kid is cool and sexy, and being old (my God, forties!) means being dead.  Personally, I'm having none of it.  I was miserable as a teenager and I'm looking forward to the rewards of maturity.   Rent 'Welcome To The Dollhouse' or 'Lord Of The Flies,' and I guarantee they will cure you of your teenage fascination.  Grown up life has a lot of pluses.  Raising a daughter is one.  A marriage where the years spent together have created a unique bond that no one night stand can come close to is another. 
Your failure to make your grown up life work, and your desire to regress to teenhood is not something to feel proud of, Lester.  You can't turn yourself into a teen, no matter how hard you try. And even if you could, you shouldn't.  The solution to your problems would have been to fix your life.  Don't like your job?  Quit and find a better one, and not at a fast food place.  Don't like your marriage?  Don't obsess over teen girls. Get some counseling.  And pay attention to that teenage daughter of yours.  Grow up, Lester.  It's not so bad. I",Null,0,0,3 May 2001
Ghostbusters," Not so crazy about it
","To be honest, I wasn't crazy about this movie. Bill Murray's character comes off like a liar and a manipulator with little interest in science or anything else except scoring with Sigourney Weaver. The film seems to want to position him as the underdog, but in scenes in which others criticize him, I found myself nodding my head and thinking 'You're right, he is a loser.' Murray's annoying qualities could be forgiven if he was a sympathetic character who grows into a better person, like Dustin Hoffmans' character in the far superior 'Tootsie' (A film that Ghostbusters eclipsed as the highest grossing comedy.) But he remains a jerk throughout. The kiss he shares with Sigourney at the end seems like a tacked on happy ending that is entirely unearned. Murray seems disinterested in what is happening in the film, cracking lame jokes but hardly ever involved in the action in any meaningful way. He's the least capable ghostbuster, and the others have to explain things to him. I know this was popular but I'll never understand why.",Null,0,3,18 November 2007
Toy Story 3," Godot with toys
","Anyone wondering what Schindler's List might have looked like if performed by toys need look no further than 'Toy Story 3.' An ugly, dark, joyless movie, 'Toy Story 3' will frighten children and send adults into therapy.The first 'Toy Story' was a delight, capped off with a fun and exciting chase sequence, in which Buzz and Woody attempted to catch up to the moving van that held all of their friends. Sure, if they hadn't made it, it would have been sad. But the chase and the movie as a whole was a lot of fun, capped off by some fun Randy Newman songs.'Toy Story 2' was an even better movie, because it added an interesting ingredient to the soup: An acknowledgment of death. The sequence where Jessie laments how her life lost its meaning when her owner grew up is truly heart breaking. And the final spoken lines of dialogue, referencing Buzz's catch phrase 'To infinity and beyond,' but placing the phrase in the context of death itself was a masterstroke. Adding these dark elements in select moments elevated the movie into something special.'Toy Story 3' makes the mistake of taking those select moments and turning them into the WHOLE MOVIE. The stink of death, loss and alienation is as prevalent here as a Beckett play. The story of Lotso's grim rejection by his owner and his subsequent change to a dark, Nazi-like dictator poisons the fun. (What, no up tempo Randy Newman song about that?) And the depiction of Ken as a gay stereotype was offensive, and future generations will squirm at those moments, like they do today over the racist depiction of Asians in 'Breakfast at Tiffanies.' (The Pixar films would never take a black or Jewish toy and make them act in a stereotypical fashion, but I guess gays are fair game.) As with most sequels, character growth is mostly zero. The characters have done all their growing in the earlier segments, and so they spend the movie mostly running around, learning nothing, never growing. Woody comes off as absurdly delusional in his belief that the best thing for him and the others is to sit in a plastic bag in an attic for decades until such time as maybe Andy wants his children to play with them.But life at the daycare center is another form of hell. The film strives to depict the toy's plight as a parody of a prison film, but ends up evoking the holocaust and Nazi concentration camps. The tyranny, torture (yes, torture) and betrayals the toys face in the day care center are dark and awful, but still pale in comparison to the act three climax. Here, we have the pleasure of watching our heroes in a trash compactor, facing an almost certain death in an oven, to be burned alive. Again, one can't help but think of the holocaust and how the victims there were burned in ovens.But it all ends happily. The characters are saved and live happily ever after.Or do they? For a film that shows such craft in its writing and such subtlety in its characterizations, the final fifteen minutes of the film are mind boggling inconsistent with what has come before. It begins with the claw, that rescues its characters, God-like, from their peril. Up until now, God-like interventions had been non-existent. These characters always had the ingenuity to get themselves out of jams, but suddenly not here.In the scenes that follow, Andy suddenly loves his toys. And life at the daycare is a toy utopia. (Remember that the only change is that Lotso is gone. I guess he took all the evil with him when he left.) The final image of the film is the sky, with a series of similar looking clouds. Seem familiar? It's the same clouds as the wallpaper in Andy's room. The characters have found themselves, post-fire, in a happy but manufactured world. Conclusion: They died in the fire and this is heaven. I'm happy for them, because sitting through this movie, I felt like I was in hell.",3,44,105,15 July 2010
High Fidelity," A sour, bleak film
","Please forgive me for writing my review in list form.  It seemed highly appropriate, though perhaps a little unoriginal.  The reasons I didn't like `High Fidelity'.  1)  Rob is: a)  immature, b)  alienated, c)  depressed, d)  self-destructive, e)  passive and f)  almost completely aimless.  If you haven't seen the movie, I can tell you that none of these things are played up for comic purposes.  He's just a pathetic man living out a pathetic existence.  2)  Rob isn't just the main character here, he's the whole movie.  He spends roughly half of the film alone, talking to the audience.  I don't think I'd want that much one-on-one from any character in any movie, let alone this character (see # 1.)  3)  The scenes he did have with other characters almost always fell into one of three categories:  a)  Rob lies or is lied to. b)  Rob is criticized, or criticizes, or feels hatred towards someone. c)  Rob engages in meaningless small talk.    What the film (and Rob's life) lacks is Rob engaging in any meaningful, positive interactions with other people.  He's very alienated.  This makes the film very bleak and unpleasant.  It make it harder to grab us emotionally, and care about Rob.  4)  Rob's life (and this movie) lack any sense of urgency or trajectory. Rob is aimless, blowing through life, with few goals.  The story drags. 
5)  I know that people like Rob exist, and that the filmakers did a good, uncompromising job of capturing him, warts and warts (I was going to say `warts and all' but I couldn't figure out what the `all' is.)  Nevertheless, it's not enough to be realistic.  I wanted to care, to get involved, and I never did.  The characters never generated any sympathy and the story never developed any momentum.",Null,0,0,8 June 2000
