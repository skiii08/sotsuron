Marie Antoinette," The movie is a masterpiece and the music superb.
","I think that this movie is a masterpiece and the music was superb. I have seen it 4 times and enjoy it every time. It is well depicted according to history if you know about French history and have been to Versaille.I have read books like Marie Antoinette by Stefan Zweig 'The Portrait of an Average Woman', but the movie is more close to Marie Antoinette, 'The Journey' by Antonia Fraser. The movie really takes you to the past, you can feel it. I congratulate Sofia for her art in showing history in a manner that we could really understand who was the fascinating girl named Marie Antoine,Arduchesse of Austria and later Queen of France.Waiting for your next masterpiece!",10,1,4,15 January 2008
