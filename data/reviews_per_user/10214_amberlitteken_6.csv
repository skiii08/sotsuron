It," All aboard the IT hype train!
","Elements I look for in a horror movie include 1. scenes that invoke the feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach 2. music that underscored the tone and builds suspense adding to my feelings of unease and 3. well done cinematography and acting that leads to my full immersion into the movie and gives me that adrenaline rush; that fight-or-flight instinct that has me death gripping the cup holder.The IT remake hit the mark on each of these elements. It had enough nostalgia from the original while kicking everything up a notch that it will please both people new to the franchise and older Stephen King fans alike. Hell, even Stephen King was immensely pleased with how IT turned out! 10/10",10,2,3,8 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Amazing!
","What are you doing reading this review? Go see the movie! It's fantastic!!! I was laughing as soon as the movie started, after the credits (seriously don't miss the end scene!), and even now thinking about it. This is now my favorite Thor movie AND Marvel movie. There was not one stale moment during this film unlike other Marvel movies. Highly recommend.",10,1,10,9 November 2017
Justice League," Too much going on
","The main things that fell short for me in Justice League was the weak uninteresting villain, the unrelatable super heroes, not to mention the wasted time on new character introductions. The villain was so uninteresting in this movie I had to look up his name: Steppenwolf. So insert uninteresting overdone villain plot here. He wants earth to be his and unleashes these hellish bugs in swarms all over to help him take it. And he couldn't just do this himself he needed the help of these weird ancient magic boxes. Yeah I dunno. I can't even recall him being in a decent fight scene. Actually, Steppenwolf isn't in a lot of the movie. He is never really shown preparing for battles, raging over failures, or celebrating his successes.Justice League had unrelatable superheros. Take Superman for instance. He is literally better than any of the other superheros at everything. What is the point in having a super-fast superhero like Flash, if Superman can run (oh, or fly...can Flash do that!) just as fast as him? Wonder Woman couldn't take Superman in a one on one fight. And Batman? At this point he is more like a concerned citizen with lots of money. So Flash, Wonder Woman, and Batman are irrelevant when standing next to Superman. We also rarely see these heroes make a mistake. They always overcome what should be undefeatable opposition, with tactics, pure strength, teamwork or Superman, their ace in the hole.Since Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg did not have their own character introduction movie, Justice League had to take time out of the movie to introduce these characters, give them some backstory and bring them into the League. Oh and Superman was dead at the end of Batman v Superman...so they had to find a way to bring him back to life. This was all a huge mistake. These many disparate plots detracted from the movies main conflict and resolution plot and had the audience watching weak character development. The audience had to switch context multiple times between bringing in Flash...waiting on Aquaman to stop being a loner, deal with Cyborg learning about his newly acquired powers, reviving Superman, and oh right. the dude trying to destroy the world.Oh...and if you thought Superman's face looked weird in this movie, you are right. Henry Cavill had a mustache during part of the filming, which they had to edit out in post production.",4,0,0,16 December 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Best Avengers movie to date
","Marvel and the directors have done a fantastic job at keeping the movie spoiler free, so I'm going to keep this review spoiler free too. :)A few things you should know going into the movie, if you are deciding if you want to take your child or whatever, is that this movie is not another Thor Ragnarok. This movie is super dark to Ragnarok's light-hearted, fun. Not that it isn't good, its just different. The second thing you should know is the movie will not end resolved. This is more like a part 1. But a tastefully done and much needed movie split, not like Harry Potter or Twilight or The Hobbit, where it just seems like a money grab. And as always stay after the credits for the Marvel patented end credit scene. Hands down the best thing about this movie is the villain Thanos and the amount of character development the put into the script. It's almost unprecedented the amount of screen time afforded to the antagonist. The second best thing is all the characters in this movie! The scale of the Marvel character integration is is just awesome. We see the Guardians of the Galaxy cast meet Thor, we have Spider-Man, the Black Panther, Dr. Strange, Loki, the Winter Soldier, and the core Avengers team: Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, the Black Widow, Vision, the Scarlet Witch, and more! We really only miss Ant-Man and Hawkeye. :(This is a must see in theaters movie, before you accidentally read or overhear a spoiler. Best enjoyed with popcorn.",10,1,4,13 May 2018
The Disaster Artist," James Franco did a fantastic job.
","The Room, may actually be the worst movie ever made. It is so bad that it wrapped back around the rating scale and actually became, good? No, that can't be right...But somehow this movie now has 'cult classic' status. This movie has a horrible plot, terrible script and even worse acting brought to you by the producer, director and actor Tommy Wiseau, who played the character Johnny. If you have not seen The Room yet, you probably should...even if you have to fast forward most of it. You definitely need to watch it in order to fully appreciate The Disaster Artist. James Franco's portrayal of Tommy Wiseau/Johnny was spot on, his accent and mannerisms had me amazed and many of the scenes in The Disaster Artist looked like they were plucked straight from The Room.James Franco fantastically portrayed Tommy Wiseau. It really is a testament to Franco's acting skills that at times I actually questioned if it was Wiseau or James Franco on the big screen. The imagined behind the scenes depictions of Wiseau as he goes through filming and 'acting' was so believable. The end of The Disaster Artist actually had me questioning if it was a comedy, like I initially believed. It felt more like a tragedy near the end. And maybe that is how we know Franco did an amazing job: that we can go from completely mocking Wiseau and his terrible acting and screen writing in The Room - to watching The Disaster Artist and relating to Wiseau through James Franco's portrayal. James Franco might even deserve an Oscar for his performance.",8,0,1,2 January 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Whodunit!
","I definitely enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express. It was a fun murder mystery. The greatest thing about this movie was, hands down, the whodunit feel. Murder on the Orient Express was very reminiscent of the Scooby Doo or Nancy Drew mysteries from my childhood. The detective, is Hercule Poirot, a borderline OCD character that strives to find an even balance in everything in life. Because of his unique outlook, he has throughout his life become a great detective with the ability to see things that are out of place. While trying to go on a real vacation, he takes the train Orient Express where there is eventually, of course, a murder. The movie follows the detective as he strives to ascertain the murderer by finding clues, questioning the other passengers for motives, and cross referencing alibis. I thought the characters were well played by their actors, the flow of the movie was never stale, and the detectives mustache were on point. Throughout the movie I was switching between which passenger was my top suspect for the case, and the ending did not disappoint me.",7,7,18,13 November 2017
