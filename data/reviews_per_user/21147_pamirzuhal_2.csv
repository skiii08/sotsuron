Iron Man 3," best film
",I have seen this film it was the best film I have ever seen and I liked it very much. I have seen it twice and as usual the second and third parts are better than the first one. I enjoyed watching it. I'm not a massive iron man addict but this film is full of action and adventure with lots of special effects. There is a good use of computer generated graphics. The acting was very good and there were lots of famous people in the film. The story was very interesting I liked the film. Iron man was very strong and had special power. the only thing I did not like because it was a long film.I would recommend this film for the people who have seen the first two.,10,1,4,17 January 2014
