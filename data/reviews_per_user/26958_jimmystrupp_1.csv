Saturday Night Fever," Boring, pointless and nauseating film
","What a miserable film! I was in the 'Disco Sucks' crowd in highschool and never did get around to watching this iconic film. Funny thing, though I am still not a fan of disco, the club scenes were the about the only watchable part of this dark, weak plotted flick. Only the soundtrack and the funky dance scenes made it
bearable. Good enough opening scene then the film takes a nosedive. After we were a third of the way through, the discussion was should we bother to finish this miserable flick or not. Every other word was the F-er and the fast forward came in handy all too often for the adult film , foulness, misogyny, violence and sleaze. I felt like I needed to take a shower after all the raunch. Every character creeped me out; not one to root for. They all could have jumped off the bridge at the end, I wouldn't of cared. Cool dance moves in a otherwise boring, pointless and nauseating film.",1,1,3,16 March 2020
