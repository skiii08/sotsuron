The King's Speech," An Intimate look at the life of Royalty and how it Shaped History!
","Set in Pre-WWII England, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), the King's youngest son, has a stuttering problem. His wife Elizabeth (Carter), in desperation, seeks out an unorthodox elocutionist (Rush). The three of them embark on a great journey that exposes the human in all of us and plays an intricate part of History.One of the greatest movies you'll ever see this year! It's a wonderful exchange between the Nobility and common classes exacted through the roles of these great actors. The writing is brilliant and the delivery is classic without being too boring.Who knew being a member of the Royal family would have so much pressure attached? Firth's depiction of such a pivotal historical figure must invoke an even deeper love of England's King. Rush's anti-groveling is quite-witted and entertaining. Carter is wonderful. Watching her, you honestly forget that she's played villains in other recent blockbusters.I highly recommend this movie.",9,1,3,26 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," As Swashbuckling as 'Curse of the Black Pearl'!
","To be honest, I was not a fan of Pirates 2 and 3. They seemed thrown together to make a movie as quickly as possible to sell tickets...mission over-accomplished. So I had my doubts going into 'Stranger Tides'In this new adventure, Sexy wonder of the World, Capt Jack Sparrow is off on a quest to find the fountain of youth. We see many characters of Pirates past and new faces with new villains. Ian McShane is superfluous as Blackbeard. His depiction in the movie is wonderful. Johnny Depp is on queue, as always. The Romantic story of a handsome religious zealot, falling for a beautiful and dangerous mermaid is AWESOME! The last piece of the recipe, which remains to be scene (pun intended) is Penelope Cruz, as Angelica opposite Sparrow. I'm not certain I'm convinced of her caliber playing opposite such an icon. We will see as this franchise sets sail once again. I believe (and hope) that this film will run the course of the first in theaters, gaining popularity as time goes on with even bigger box office busters to follow. I highly recommend this movie as someone who loved the first 'Pirates' film, still purchased the 2nd and 3rd. Then thoroughly enjoyed the 4th.",7,0,1,22 May 2011
Skyfall," Much better than Quantum of Solace
","Finally, the return of Daniel Craig as Bond. At the first the movie follows the typical Bond spy vs. spy type film. As it progresses, we get to see a side of Bond and M that is not revealed in any Bond film so far. I enjoy the change and the deepening of the Story plot. I've read other reviews saying it's the worst Bond ever. That's ridiculous, have you seen the original Casino Royale? Daniel Craig has been criticized as being a blow up, high impact, no smart gadget Bond. I agree. He's a Bond for today's generation. Q is nerd, but most people today identify with the gadgets and electronics that previous Bonds were so famous for, the element of blunt instrument violence lends a great appeal for movie goers now. If you're a Bond fan, this movie should not disappoint.",7,5,15,10 November 2012
Tangled," An Adventure that put the Magic of Disney back in theatres again...
","Better than the Princess and the Frog! Disney did a great job with this film. Yeah, it's still a Fairytale, but honestly with all the other animated films Disney has under it's belt, combined with what Dreamworks is putting out, there aren't a lot of fairy tales left out there.It's a unique creative twist on a well-known bed time story that doesn't exactly put you to sleep. The Characters are spot on, though typical. Flynn Rider, your bad boy stereotype bumps into a perfect princess and shares an adventure laced with romance and plenty of humor.This is a great flick to take the family to and I look forward to seeing what Disney has next in the pipeline.",8,2,4,12 January 2011
No Strings Attached," Great fun date flic!
","This movie has a typical romantic comedy plot but honestly, the only variables in all romantic comedies are characters and script dialogue.Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher do a great job of exhibiting chemistry and getting the audience to hope the two of them into a happily ever after denouement.They're both beautiful and appealing to a lot of people. Their performances are a great combination of crack up laughter and heart felt longing.The dialogue is witty and somewhat vulgar in certain instances that makes for a fun time whether you're out with your friends or on a date.",8,42,80,26 January 2011
Brave," Good but not great...
","The backdrop for the movie and the music are enchanting and lovely. As for the storyline, the challenges our protagonist faces, They are a little confusing. She has a few antagonists to deal with. First, this is a coming of age movie, Merida battles the traditions of her culture as far as a choosing a suitor, But she doesn't find a suitor, at all. Second, she deals with her strained relationship with her mother, this is the central struggle within the movie, a theme that is rarely explored in fairytaledom. Personally, I don't think it hit the mark as firmly as the father son relationship in Finding Nemo. Lastly, Merida unlocks the mystery of a Tale about her culture from years ago. Bottom line, the movie has too many different Antagonistic elements that aren't fully developed throughout the storyline. The film will definitely sit among the staples of the media of choice for young people, but I don't think it's been the best product that Pixar has delivered.",6,1,4,29 June 2012
Thor," Great Action Flic, BUT...
","This movie is really good on a lot of levels, from the buff, good-looking Hemsworth to the charming Portman. The Audience is transported to another world to see where Odin lives and it's believable. But I was looking for a little more depth of character from the God of thunder. We know as the hero, he is supposed to save the day, but his concern and instant love for all humanity almost seem to come from nowhere as he transitions from the headstrong reckless God of war, to a hero who suddenly loves the entire planet.Portman's portrayal of Jane is good, but I believe she didn't have much to work with by way of script and much of their interaction seemed rushed. Though we are left looking forward to a sequel in the Avengers, I still wished we could have seen, just a little more depth to the people involved here before moving on to the avengers.",6,0,2,8 May 2011
