The King's Speech," A sure-fire Oscar nomination
","Having read reviews of this film soon after its release, I knew I had to see it. Best decision I've made in a while. The characterisation of the main players, esp Helena BC, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush is first class with performances which should rightly earn each an Oscar nomination at least. The production design is so evocative of the time with homes in the style I remember from my childhood accurately recreated.Firth's reserved then occasionally uninhibited manner while working with Logue is a masterpiece of acting but it is also hard to decide which of the two is bringing out the best in the other, they are so well matched. Top marks for casting. There are few if any 'exciting' scenes but it would be hard not to feel a welling of emotion as the future king stumbles towards his potentially catastrophic major speech announcing the start of war with Germany. Even as he delivers it, Logue (Rush) is coaching him with his unconventional style. The result is heartwarming and undeniably realistic (a typically British rather than American finale, if that makes sense).Cannot recommend this film too highly. Music is great too.",10,1,3,18 January 2011
Jurassic World," Unexpectedly bad - American Hokum Dressed Up As Entertainment
","I could hardly wait to see this sequel having been a fan of the franchise since the original Jurassic Park was released. Despite the hype and anticipation, after just half an hour of this drivel, I wanted to leave. I wonder which studio official decided this disgraceful insult to the term 'Jurassic' should be distributed in its present form. It seems the first draft of the script outline, with all its plot holes, lack of dramatic tension and predictability was enough to convince them it would be a money spinner and further development was unnecessary before filming started. Conceptually, this is proof, if proof were needed, that the US film-making fraternity are convinced that a movie not full of guns, rockets and helicopters can't be exciting. We have an improbable hunky hero who remains unsweaty, groomed and clean after several days battling dinos in a steamy jungle, a woman (supposed to be a good actress but in this film it is hard to believe) whose idea of jungle attire is designer corporate wear with her sleeves rolled up and high heels. And then there are the kids; both of them have minimal screen presence and their main role contribution is to whimper and be even more stupid than you'd expect. What a polar difference to the pair in Jurassic Park. Spielberg has an expert eye for top notch child acting talent and should at least have been consulted on these two.Apparently there was no upper limit on the budget for special effects and they are superb but the plot is dire in the extreme and so full of holes it can make a true fan cry. Cloying and shameful references to its prequels abounded but they seem inappropriate in a movie that has moved so far from a great concept and cinematography to low-grade video game garbage.Probably the most disappointing movie I have seen in decades.",1,17,32,25 June 2015
