United 93," Beautiful&Heartbreaking
","I watched all the Oscar nominated best pictures this year and I have seen most films released since, but this movie moved me (that is saying something) like nothing I have ever seen before. The transition from the mundane routines of life to the realization that every moment we are alive is worth fighting for is captured flawlessly by this film. The director himself spoke of the bravery of those terrified passengers as the first act of retaliation in a Post 9/11 world. They knew their fate from heartbreaking last words with their loved ones, they knew they had to try and all of us can empathize with what they did because we would do the same if our lives depended on it. Please watch this, feel it and never forget...",10,1,4,19 June 2006
