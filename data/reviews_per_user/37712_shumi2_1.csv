Alien 3," Most underrated movie ever
","This movie is simply excellent - the action, the crew, the acting, and mostly the soundtrack. I don't understand why so many IMDb users say so bad about it. The extended edition is a 'must have' - those 31 minutes in plus make the difference. For me, it is much better than the second of the sequel ('Aliens') - there were too many creatures (Sigourney Weaver thinks that too). My only regret is the divergences between the theatrical and the extended version. I would prefer an hibrid version, mainly because of the end part (when Ripley falls into the furnace - I prefer the version in which the alien gets off her chest) and I prefer the version in which the alien gets off the dog.",10,3,4,28 January 2011
