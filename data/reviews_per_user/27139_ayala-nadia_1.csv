Come and See," Realistic!!
","The reality of this film is amazing. I felt as if I were in the scenes, whether it was an explosion, a love scene, or death scene, you were shown the results of these events happening as if it were happening to you. The use of the hand held camera made me feel as if I were actually following the protagonist step by step. The disappointment the protagonist feels when he could not deliver the cow to feed his people, I was saddened because he tried so hard and had gotten so far. The scene were the chapel is being burned down, was so emotional and scared me. Seeing this happen right before my eyes and the idea that this happened is truly tragic. The actors performances were so real. Glasha's character going crazy not knowing how to feel, act, or what to do. The protagonist not only mentally but had physical changes through out the movie. He started out as this naive boy and grew into a man who has seen everything. This film was possible because of perestroika and glasnost and marks a new beginning for Russian film making. I am glad I got to see it.",10,2,2,2 August 2009
