Raiders of the Lost Ark," I LOVE this movie!!
","I love this kick-butt movie. I think its the best in the series!! This is on my top 5 most favorite movie list!!!! U RULE HARRISON FORD!! Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are the best movie producers/directors/writers EVER!! I love the part in the start of the movie when Indy retrieves the golden fertility idol. I personally DO NOT think the special effects in this movie were cheesy at ALL. Lucas and Spielberg make a great team. They did pretty good for being made in 1981. Before i saw it i thought it was going to be cheesy as heck! but it wasn't.GOOD JOB! -Luke P.S. If Harrison Ford is reading this message, PLease email me! Please and Thank you.
