United 93," mega intense
","Very good movie, but don't go see it with out preparing yourself. I don't remember a more intense time at a movie theater. The way it was shot brings you right into the film. I think the movie actually takes place in real time. The story takes place in the 111 minutes that the movie runs. I was also impressed by the number of people that play themselves in the film. The actors are all unknowns and take a backseat to the story. The film is more than just a memorial to a group of folks who decided to do something in the face of terror. It can serve as a way to bring us together and ask questions, again. I am still a bit conflicted about recommending this movie, however. Perhaps it is too soon for some folks. Perhaps the wounds are still too fresh for some.",9,5,12,28 April 2006
