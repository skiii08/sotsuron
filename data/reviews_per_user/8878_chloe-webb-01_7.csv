It," I don't know what to think..
","I appreciate acting, cinematography, music, settings, locations, lighting...the works, in films. But I just can't seem to love this. If they had stayed with that haunted looking house as the main setting, then I would have really liked it. But let me list all the random places in this film: school, a few different homes of the kids, a library, a cellar, a haunted house, the sewers, the woods, the waterhole, the town, the garage, the pharmacy...I'll stop there. It was just small glimpses of every place to try and shed light on every single thing, it was almost like it wasn't a straight story to follow. Alas, some of them were great. Some scenes dragged, some scenes weren't enough. The clown itself was great: scary, good voice and acting. But it kept shape shifting into weird things haha. The kids were good, but not as amazing as people are saying in reviews. It was well filmed too. There was one scene in the movie that just turned me off and lost my interest..and that was the 'cleaning the bathroom'. I thought, okay..so they just happen to have all these cleaning supplies and extra gloves and they are gonna clean it top to bottom? Shouldn't it just disappear?! Anyways. Watch it yourself and see how you go. I'm not sad I paid to see it. Just wanted it a little more basic and not so exaggerated.",6,21,40,7 September 2017
This Is the End," Movies like this restore my faith
","I thought it was excellent. Most movies are whipped up in 5 minutes and never show detail or excitement, enough to captivate the audience. Every character was made primary and each had an equal part. The good CGI was used on the important parts, and the way the movie chopped and changed genre a few times, was really creative. Improvisation made this movie, and characters did pull off being realistic. The acting was very well done and there is not much to fault on the movie, besides a few predictable scenes, here and there. I'm also a little sad that those few good characters didn't make it to the end. But.. As long as these guys keep making movies, I'll keep paying to see them! UNREAL!!!If I could relate it to any other movie it would be: Little Nicky!",8,4,12,14 August 2013
The Hateful Eight," Definitely not a classic
","OK, so what do you think when you think of a Tarantino movie? Me, well I think of: great camera angles, impeccable actors and acting, brilliant or witty dialogue, terrific screenplay, quirky and intense soundtrack, bloodshed, suspense, cleverness, plot twists, strange and just a style that is his own. Let me just be upfront and honest about this movie, there were quirky uses of songs- but they did not work. There were good camera angles but bad lighting. There were outrageous displays from characters but nothing we had not seen before, and far less convincing. There was a great cast, yet no actor truly shone through. Apart from Kurt Russel and those beastly mutton chops and handlebars being his facial hair. The costume designer went overboard and it led to confusion. The set was intriguing at first but soon came to be the reason I was doubting the storyline and what was transpiring. Yes there was blood, and the catering to the brutality fanbase. But characters dropping one by one is hard to believe in such circumstances. Tarantino has used several of previous success and ideas from his catalogue and tried to apply them to this movie. He is scraping for ideas and desperately trying to somehow have the wow factor. To me, it was history repeating itself, it left me yawning and wishing he would cast someone besides Samuel. L Jackson.",3,2,10,27 January 2016
Suicide Squad," A little short of what it could be
","Firstly, I found it started off quite fast, introducing all the characters as briefly as possible, was a task. There was some substance missing in the scenes of the Joker, to begin with. I feel as though there could have been much more dramatic shots of him, it was almost comedic like. However, in the later half of the film I seen Jared Leto shine through with glimpses of his fantastic acting skills. If there is to be a sequel, which is obvious- then I believe they will allow more screen time for the diabolic couple, Harley and Joker. The first thing that struck me was the soundtrack! Instead of instrumental or theme songs, they chose well known classics from different genres to spark interest for the viewer, as first seeing each character, the songs coincided with them. Secondly, you can rest assured that the costume department was not lacking in this film! Every piece was striking and significant of each character. I can almost predict that cosplay lovers are going crazy for the next comic conventions, to show off their replicas from this film. Lots of great props and whimsical items throughout. The overall inclusions of the film are good for any movie lover, as it catered to the bad ass, the sexy, the sad, funny, action, serious and quality actors that make a great essential. The part that fell short, in my opinion, was the plot and the scenes that we have oh so many times seen. Which are 'let's save the city' and the gun action fights in between buildings. There wasn't enough to capture you through those moments, in the cgi department. I did like the variety of all the characters, but at the same time it was hard to enjoy it more, knowing that it was far fetched. I would have liked an in depth on each character and why they had special powers or what have you. My favourite would have to be Diablo, he is super cool for anyone that likes an underdog or not so much of a showy costume character. I have to agree that Margo Robbie was superb in her acting, and the delivery of all her lines were on the mark. The Joker was not in it enough and didn't have solid script to mesmerize, hopefully we see more of him to come. So I would like to say, go see this and enjoy it, but don't expect to be amazed. It's just some bad ass fun.",6,1,8,4 August 2016
The Lion King," It's just like how they revamped Crash Bandicoot! Refreshing
","Gonna cut to the chase. The people who are disappointed in this film were over analysing and they must not have an open mind. The movie was very well made! The opening scene is captivating, good camera shots, majestic animals and it stirs the emotions!! They stayed true to what visuals you would actually see in Africa.. the music remained the same, even the instrumental pieces, there are a few new desongs thrown in for good measure, and Beyonc√© was a great choice. The cinematography (for movie geeks) was probably the best part of all.. there is so much attention to detail in the scenes, which I loved.. the voices and the voice actors were nowhere near as bad as people are saying. I thought they were just the right fit for their characters. Mufasa death scene still makes you cry too. There really isn't much to critique besides the acting ability of the voice actors, meaning they aren't as solid as the original. Colour was lacking a bit in scenery, but overall it still had that magical feeling and it was a delight to see this cleverly made into live action. This is for a whole new generation, 25 years after the original..Disney did NOT ruin The Lion King!",7,1,5,17 July 2019
Beauty and the Beast," If they ruin The Lion King, like this..
","Rubbish. The budget went on the sets, and sets they are. Looks like something on a behind the scenes tour of a movie studio. One dimensional as if the wind would blow them over. I can't believe the dialogue and casting in this, woeful. Sad to say I'm not a Disney fan if this is what they are making. Should have left it well alone, at the original. Emma Watson is not an authentic actress. Belle is way more mysterious and calm. Just so disappointed in this film. I am cringing at it right now, while it plays in the background. I can't even sit through the rest. 3/4 of cgi and every poxy fantasy movie you have ever seen.",1,5,13,31 August 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Badass, visually awesome, daring, original.
","What can I say. I'm hardly the type to sit through a movie. Especially a 2 hour plus. But this. You cannot take your eyes off the screen. All the characters are eccentric. All the costumes are magnificent. The guns and war vehicles are completely out of this world. The ideas are flowing like mad. The filming location is so beautiful, and seeing it on the big screen is incredible. Charlize does not say much, but with her finesse, she doesn't have to. Hardy is brill. All of them play their parts excellent. The harsh desert, sweating and getting downright dirty, it is just so freakin good. I love this movie! All I can think of right now is: WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE?!?!?!!?!!?!?!?",10,3,16,5 June 2015
