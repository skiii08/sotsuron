The Ring," Japanese Water Torture
","Following in the footsteps of 'Panic Room' (see my review) and 'Punch-Drunk Love' as critically praised pieces of trash, 'The Ring' comes from underground to bore you to death at a theater near you.  This is one of those movies that is off the charts STUPID, like 'Blair Witch' STUPID, where anyone whose brain is in the 'on' position realizes that this is nothing more than a lame fright film that has been done before a hundred times.  It is far from scary and defies all logic from frame 1 to the end of the flick. This film may have the bells and whistles to entertain 11-14 year old kids, but anyone who is above the age of 20 should be embarrassed if they enjoyed this garbage.The problems are mostly plot related and I don't feel like 'spoiling' any of the logic defying twists and turns that nearly put me to sleep.  Let me just tell you that if you like really slow movies that don't require a pesky plot, or continuity, this is your cup of tea. It's a horror flick, so for the most part the acting is poor.  The 'acting' in the opening sequence is quite horrid, as if the untrained kids were reading their lines off of the script just beyond the camera.  Brion Cox, who I have seen in other films, is quite scary in his delivery, as if he forgot that he has 30 years of film experience.Naomi Watts is the one and only positive in this stinker.  Her presence alone carries this movie, as in Mulhullond Dr. (another piece of junk) and she needs to learn how to say the word 'pass' when she is offered fine fare such as this.  She still manages to remain relatively unscathed as the entire movie crashes and burns around her and hopefully will star in something better soon.If you think that 'Jeepers Creepers' and 'The Blair Witch Project' are five-star, grade-A films, this movie is made just for you.  I think those movies are amazingly dumb and I felt stupid after I watched them, and felt even dumber after watching this film.  I think 'The Ring' actually symbolizes the large plot holes that are readily apparent if you are paying attention.  If you are willing to check your brain at the door, you have a chance to not hate this movie, but I doubt it.",1,6,15,7 November 2002
Memento," This IS one of the greats.
","Now I am not the type of person who writes a glowing review about any old movie, because usually those that I like get enough acclaim and more that I don't get too much acclaim.  This is my exception to the rule.  This movie is about as good as film gets.  This is not your everyday run of the mill, same old, same old JLo film or something, this is an original, thoughtful, intelligent film.  Those that have read or heard that it is 'backward' or 'confusing' pay attention while I explain the unexplainable:  when the movie is in color, the plot is from the back and is progressing to the middle, thus the first five minutes of the film occur at the end of the sequence of events.  Then the next five minutes are in black and white and are the beginning of the story arc (there are additional flashbacks of Leonard's memories, but those are fairly easy to follow).  Then it goes back to the next color scene which is the one chronologically in front of the opening scene, then another black and white which is the next scene from the beginning.  The film actually comes together with the final black and white scene becoming color and then there is the conclusion, but both parts are actually the middle: so scene 23, then 1, then 22, then 2, and so on.Now to the actual merits of the film:  Guy Pearce carried 'LA Confidential' on his shoulders (with the help of some fine actors) and has amazingly gotten bigger shoulders because this is his film.  Throughout the whole movie Pearce is front and center, the focal point.  Everything revolves around him and he gives a great performance, without overacting once.  The rest of the cast do a passable job.Aside from Pearce's performance and the 'gimmick', there is still an amazing script, cinematography, and director which I am going to lump together and label as 'The Nolan factor.'  Nolan's other recent effort 'Insomnia' has received lukewarm reviews, but I like his work.  It is not style for the sake of style or to cover-up plot holes, it is style with substance and that is something few film-makers can achieve.To tell you how engrossed I was with this film when I first saw it on cable (and I was sure I would hate it), I literally received a phone call about 30 minutes into the film that was from my mother and I was so into the film I realized she had been talking to me for a couple of minutes and was asking what was wrong, and all I could say was 'Can I call you back in like an hour, I am watching this movie?' and as soon as she said 'Yes.' I hung up the phone, having not one time taken my eyes off of the television.If you are up for it, it is an experience, but make sure you have a little over an hour and a half set aside and are ready to think... and you may think about unplugging the phone, so you can avoid a lecture about phone etiquette.  This film is one of my 10 favorite films and deserves a 10 out of 10.",10,0,3,7 July 2003
Identity," Where is Donald Kaufman's credit?
","Wow, some movies are difficult to describe, others are a lot easier, and this falls into the second category.  I rented 'Adaptation' the last time I went to the video store and I did not like that movie much either, because it was overly slow, but there is one part that makes me laugh:  Donald Kaufman creates a script where the kidnapper, the cop and the kidnappee are all actually the same person... SPOILERS BEGIN... this is that movie. Charles Kaufman was making an overly critical statement of what has come to be considered a good film, and this movie actually uses a script mirroring the over-the-top script used in 'Adaptation'.  It is scary that a movie like this gets made in the first place.  The problems I have are from the start. First it is clearly Cusack's voice on the phone with Molina's character explaining the past.  It is clear that Molina supposedly started the 'cure' on the phone with him, because how does the movie start without it, and if that is the case, why would you 'cure' someone over the phone without having him properly watched in case something went wrong?  Why does Molina's character not know which identity killed the people as a child, especially if one of those involved is a child?  Did the child never come out and talk to Molina's character?  Then how did that identity get invited to the motel? END SPOILERI will throw the non-spoiler positives in the middle, between the criticisms.  The cinematography and acting were pretty good.  I am usually quite hard on Cusack, but he gave a good performance and wasn't overly 'cute' in the way that makes me want to shut off his movies.  This is his best performance since The Grifters and I enjoyed it.Amanda Peet looks like a hooker, but that is what she was supposed to be and she too had a good performance.  Of course, she always looks good (even as a hooker) which doesn't hurt.Jake Busey should had been used more instead of playing 'The Frighteners' role again.  He is scary, but deserved more screen time instead of being just thrown into the story with little backstory.The rest of the ensemble was fine, nothing great, but still over-achieving the script.MORE SPOILERS  Now the Liotta turn was so obvious from when he tried to call an ambulance, it just was clear he wasn't a cop.  The scene where Cusack looks in the mirror was the best scene in the entire picture BUT let you too far into what was happening and then you stop caring about which characters survive because it doesn't matter anyway, because they are not real.  The kid being the killer was VERY obvious when the mother dies, because the kid goes in to see her alone and go figure, she's dead.  Having the kid die together with someone else was too obvious, 'Gee the m.o. of the killer is to kill one at a time, and leave a key card for each, do you think anyone will notice when we conveniently give ourselves an out by 'killing' two characters at once?  No of course not, we will have the bodies disappear, at that point and then let everyone know they are watching the thoughts of a serial killer and make no more references to the pesky keys until the end, plus we can 'shock' everyone by having the kid come back in the end because the audience will be too into the 'orange-growing feel good story of an obese man, believing himself to be a really hot woman' to notice.'  If you listen really closely, you can hear Charles Kaufman screaming at how awful the plot really sounds.  END SPOILERS.I rate this movie the following way: 1 for the Cusack performance, 1 for Amanda Peet and 1 for Jake Busey, but -1 for obviousness of the plot curves and lack of creativity which gives it a 2 out of 10.",2,4,10,17 September 2003
Evil Dead II," It's not the original
","Why can't this movie be half as good as the first? I may be alone here, and that's fine, but this movie makes any low-budget B horror movie look professionally done.  For as good as the original was, this movie is as bad? I can understand if you missed the original, this may be entertaining... no, I can't understand.  This movie tries to be funny and scary, but succeeds at being neither.  Watch, rent, and buy the first one, but leave this one alone.  This movie is the definition of a 'set-up' movie.  How can the director get from 'Evil Dead' to 'Army of Darkness'?  Make a pathetic excuse of a movie to attempt to bridge the two.  This movie could never live up to the first one, but I can't believe it was THIS bad.",1,7,20,12 January 1999
