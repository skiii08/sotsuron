Sucker Punch," Hard to say
","I don't know whether this is a good or a bad film. It's just not ordinary, that's why you get the love-hate impression. I think the acting could be a tad better, but the script is bad. This is one of those films to be seen in the cinema: big screen for the action scenes and special effects, because there is no story development. One turn around, it's very simple. If only action scenes excite you, it will be an almost enjoyable film. I wouldn't watch it again soon, maybe within some months for fun. The script is not good. If the film is uncommon, the script is almost clich√©. If it seems too critical, don't worry, you can take your fun out of it. But that's all.",Null,0,0,10 June 2012
