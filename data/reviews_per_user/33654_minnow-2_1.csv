The Blair Witch Project," Nothing scary about bundles of sticks and piles of stones
","There are many scary things about 'The Blair Witch Project.' 1) someone might do a sequel 2) the style might be used by other director wannabes 3) somewhere out there, there's a director's cut with unseen footage 4) there are college kids so dumb, they really can't follow a stream down hill 5) they aren't dead 6) someday, I might pay to see another movie just as bad.One of the worst movies of 1999!",1,1,3,5 September 1999
