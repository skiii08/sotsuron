The Mask," Jim Carrey
","Jim Carrey and the character he plays fits him super well.Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors ever. In this movie, he is able to show his wide range of acting abilities. I truly don't think anyone else could've played this role better.Jim Carrey is the Lebron James of the cast and crew on this film team for 'Mask'.Overall, a funny, entertaining movie.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
It," Stephen King; Great Storytelling
","A scary movie beyond just being scary.There are many symbolic elements and metaphors in this movie. Stephen King tends to do that in his books - this movie is made after his book 'It'.The filmmaking complements this story so well. From certain lighting, to the sfx, to the music, and animations.If you want to have your brain twisted for a couple hours, this is a go to movie. Well, any Stephen King based movie for that matter.",9,1,2,9 May 2020
If I Stay," Memorable Movie
","I shed a few tears on this one.The mix of music, the theme, and the fictional aspect of it has with it a touch of realism too.We all wish we could see ourselves outside our own bodies. If I stay showcases that and much more.I can remember where I watched this movie and when I watched it because it was so memorable.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
Fight Club," Cinematography and Acting is Great
","David Fincher is someone I have come across recently. I have been delving deeper into studying directors and their films and David Fincher is on that list of mine.Fincher does a great job of using black fill and a low key lighting shot to complement the theme of 'Fight Club'.And along with the great cinematography is a great cast that put a ton of effort into making this movie be felt by the viewer.Unique, interesting, and funny are my words to use here.",6,0,0,9 May 2020
The Hunger Games," Top Tier
","The Hunger Games series is a special one. I read the books prior to watching the movies and the movie does a great job of mapping out the storyline.Jennifer Lawrence brings a stellar performance to the table on this one.Many people imagine a world in which things like this can happen. This movie brings it to life and makes it moving and emotional, as well.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Rocky V," Excellent
","Excellent.Not writing a review because Rocky I was when I went into major depth of doing Rocky movie reviews. I've been doing this for a couple hours now and just want to finish.But, that doesn't neglect the amazing quality and storytelling of Rocky and the Rocky series.Love you Philly. Love you Rock.",6,0,1,10 May 2020
The Irishman," Scorsese Masterpiece
","I love the basis of when this film takes place and it's even cooler because I live in the Philadelphia area.Martin Scorsese does an amazing job of making this filmmaking match the storytelling. Some of my favorite parts were interactions between Frank and his daughter - especially when they were eating breakfast after he killed someone on a mission the night prior and the wide angle lens makes it feel close. It's as though Frank's daughter knew what was going on, but since there was nothing said, the filmmaking fills the silence void.I enjoyed this film with a great film crew and cast.",8,2,2,8 May 2020
Finding Nemo," Something We All Know
",This is at the top of the list for best movies of my younger life. Disney was always the best with adding personality to its animated characters.In 'Finding Nemo' they gave these fishes all different personality types. It's hilarious to watch their journey to recover Marlin's son Nemo.A great movie that will live on with its legacy for a long time.,8,0,0,9 May 2020
Superbad," Let's Go
","Let's go Jonah Hill and co.This movie is written from a true story perspective as Seth Rogen mentioned in an interview.I watched this when in high school so I can relate, but definitely not to the full magnitude of experience that this movie portrays.So for that reason, it was entertaining and hilarious to watch. This will always be funny to watch.It will age like fine wine for the following generation too.",8,2,2,9 May 2020
Creed," Great Sequel to Rocky
","Michael B. Jordan crushes this one. It's great to see the Rocky legacy live on and Creed still be remembered.How would've thought that this string of movies would come after the original Rocky.The filmmaking in this one is modern and up to date and gives a renewed spirit to Rocky and the young Creed himself.Now, new generations can appreciate the series of Rocky through Creed.Great work on this long-awaited film cast and crew.",8,1,1,10 May 2020
Creed," Crushed It.
","Michael B. Jordan crushed it on this long-awaited film.In a sequel to the Rocky series, its great to see the legacy live on. How amazing is it that they made this string of movies with Rocky and now Creed.Great work by the cast and crew and bringing a more modern feel to Rocky and this boxing movie.Live on Creed!",8,0,0,10 May 2020
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Classic

Dead Poets Society," Deserving 10/10
","A rare 10/10 and it's deserving of such. This movie had a profound impact on me....and no better person to play it then the great Robin Williams.He acted with such emotion and intensity and vigour in each scene. It is RARE to feel like I'm inside the film, but in this case I felt like Robin Williams was constantly talking to me in this film.Alongside him, the rest of the cast did a great job.This movie was more than just acting. It represented how a person should live and enjoy life. Thank you for such a gem.",10,2,2,9 May 2020
About Time," Romantic Twist on Top of a Twist
","Romantic movies have my heart, but one with a mix of time travel and fictional magic to it, is fun to watch.It let's the viewer live through the main performer, Tim, as well.I'll probably watch this back eventually.",8,0,0,5 May 2020
The Last Song," Romantic Movie to Remember
",I can't remember a ton of this movie from watching it many years ago.But I enjoyed watching it for the players in it and the theme surrounding it.,4,1,1,5 May 2020
The Terminator," Legend
","'I'll be back'

Shutter Island," Wow. Wow. Wow.
","I was trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together the entire time. But it was only till the very, very end that Martin Scorsese decides to pull the cat out of the hat and reveal to us the true scheme of the movie.The film has you on edge most of the time. Some things come out of nowhere that you have to take into consideration. So, there is no real mental space to actually catch up to figure it out. With that being said, the film crew knew that (or I should say the writers).So, towards the end they give you a calm softball to ease you into the reality of the scheme (just as they did in the actually film for Teddy.Unreal story. Unreal filmmaking. An all time for me. It was one of the first movies from Scorsese that truly left an impact on me.",9,0,0,9 May 2020
Doctor Strange," Insane Visuals
","I'm a big fan of all the Avenger characters and movies but this movies visual effects were astounding.As someone in the film realm, it had me astonished when I watched this as a second year student in college.I remember my friend recommending me to watch it for the visuals and symbolism.....I see why now.",6,1,1,6 May 2020
Interstellar," Memorable and Remarkable
","When I remember where, when, how, and who I watched a movie with......you know it's special.Interstellar fits that category.It was similar to inception but I was able to follow it a little more in depth.One of my favorite scenes was when Cooper (NASA pilot) uses the signal of pushing the books in an alternate universe he is in to signify he is still alive to his daughter. And if that made no sense, please watch the movie.It is astounding, fascinating, and mental chess are good words to use for a movie description here.",8,1,1,9 May 2020
Rocky II," Excellent
","Excellent.Not writing a review because Rocky I was when I went into major depth of doing Rocky movie reviews.

Forrest Gump," Iconic
","I was in Los Angeles two months ago and while there I traveled to Santa Monica. When at the Santa Monica pier, my friend took me to Bubba Gump Shrimp (a place where he actually worked for a short period of time while living in LA).It was unbelievable to me that a restaurant was made after a movie. That shows the magnitude of the Forrest Gump brand in totality.But besides the food being great at Bubba Gump, I enjoyed the movie even more so. Storytelling was at its apex in the Forrest Gump movie.",9,0,0,29 April 2020
"Monsters, Inc."," The Best Movie For my Younger Self
","Monsters, Inc. Pixar. Storytelling.One of the most iconic movies in my generations time. As I get older and older, I begin to appreciate more and more the work of Pixar and the animated movies that made a massive impact on me.The best thing is....it's all centered around a kids fantasy of monsters in a closet. Just think about that. So, amazing.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Elevated
","Young, courageous soldier to Captain America.I love how they set up the point until Captain America become Captain America. Especially, when they used the test of throwing the fake grenade on the ground to see which soldier would react fast enough and which soldier would have the most courage to jump on it.From that point on, the visual effects and transformation of Steve Rogers is great.A superhero movie that doesn't disappoint.",6,1,1,9 May 2020
10 Things I Hate About You," Funny Classic
","This film is dated more than the other romantic movies I've watched, but it was one of the best out of all of them.Even though I gave it a 6, it performs well for the younger me. It was the relatable high school facet of it that appealed to me most.",6,0,0,5 May 2020
Baby Driver," All Time Movie
","Baby Driver tops the charts for me - by far.The filmmaking is excellent in this one and the introverted main character in a high intensity situation makes it all the more appealing.I don't usually rate 9 stars, so I can definitely say I'm thankful for this entertaining film.",9,0,1,6 May 2020
Man of Steel," Underrated By All But Fully Appreciated By Me
","(Writing this review after I wrote the review for 'The Incredibles' movie)Superman. The perfect superhero. Clean. Good looking guy. Moves with stealth.Even though he comes from another part of the universe, he grew up with an average family. I love how they have Superman's dad as an innocent and genuine man. It builds Superman into a man of character that can use his powers effectively and is more than just 'the man in the suit'.I've always loved and appreciated this movie and character. It has an innocent goodness to it.",8,2,2,9 May 2020
The Shining," Scary and Engagin
","Stephen King.That's all the review should say haha.When something from Stephen King is made into a movie, you know it is going to be great.This movie has such a great relationship between the filmmaking/cinematography and the story itself.The cast and crew executed brilliantly on this one and truly brought Stephen King's book to life.An old movie for me and my generation, but still a scary one.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
American Beauty," All Time Movie For Me
","Another rare 9 in the books - and for a reason that is.Kevin Spacey helped in making a gem on this one along with the other major players in 'American Beauty'.When I first watched this, I tried my best to decipher certain themes from it. But it was so good l, that I truly couldn't to do it as well as I wanted.It was only when my friend explained his opinions on the movie further, that my eyes were forever widened to Sam Mendes' masterpiece.",9,0,0,6 May 2020

The Intouchables," Beautiful
","'The Upside' was a remake of the 'Intouchables'.I must clarify that the 'Intouchables' is the OG and the best of the best relationship and inspirational movies I've ever watched.Even though it wasn't in my primary language of English, I felt the language of love and emotion through this film.It's so beautiful to see two totally different people come together to change each other's lives for the better.Amazing, beautiful film.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Yesterday," Watched this Yesterday
","No I didn't actually, but that would've been timely.'Yesterday' the movie is a script that many wish to ideate in their head. But only this film crew and cast can execute upon it.Behind the great filmmaking and cinematography, this movie has a sense of realness to it. Since being rich and famous isn't as great as it seems if you don't have those you love around you.",8,1,2,6 May 2020
The Fault in Our Stars," Story and Romantic
",'Two teenage cancer patients begin a life-affirming journey to visit a reclusive author in Amsterdam.'I mean c'mon. How great is that?'The Fault in Our Stars' was a great book and to be made in a movie with excellent performs was amazing to see.This movie is sad but beautiful. It makes you appreciate the people and little things in life.Great job cast and crew. You made my heart happy.,6,0,1,9 May 2020
Liar Liar," Has it All.
","This movie has a little bit of everything. Comedy, drama, and family.Jim Carrey brings his all in this one. And it kind of fit the roles he previously played in movies like 'Bruce Almighty' and 'The Mask'. This storyline is a little more realistic though.I only rate movies 1-6 and 8-10. I feel like 7 is an 'on the fence, I'm not totally sure rating'. So, 'Liar Liar' definitely deserves to hop the fence to the stellar movie category for me.The ending is phenomenal too haha. Please watch if you haven't.",8,0,1,9 May 2020
Revolutionary Road," Top Movie of All Time
","And the rarest ratings of them all for me. A stellar 10. And writing this review is being done directly after writing the review for 'American Beauty'......two of Sam Mendes' greatest masterpieces of filmmaking thus far.This movie made me stay up an extra 2 hours in bed after watching it due to mullying over its beautiful filmmaking and storyline.I know Sam Mendes enjoys directing movies about the American stereotype of romantics and family. So, for him to direct 'Revolutionary Road' was a match made in heaven (no irony intended).This movie had such high and lows and the masterful duet between Leonardo and Kate made it all the better. It felt so real!!!! And it was a sad ending that didn't go the viewers way for once.And since people usually remember things for how they end, this one left a sting if beauty in my mouth. In line with that, Kate Winslet did an amazing job in this movie after the major fight scene. She came back the next day and embodied what I just said for my reality of watching this film - she wanted to leave her husband with a fond memory between them - as sad as it was too.",10,0,0,6 May 2020
Get Out," Interesting
",One of Jordan Peele's first bigger movies.He absolutely crushed this one. He used more symbolism than most experienced directors and writers use in their films.I had to really stay present throughout the entire time of watching this movie in order to understand it.Great work by cast and crew.,8,0,0,22 May 2020
Good Will Hunting," Amazing - Start to Finish
","Even the storyline is good before watching the film. That shows the potential of this film.This movie can be raved about so I'll just bring my one opinion, that's a downside, to this review. It's a little dry at times and it's pace is slow, which caused me to lose interest at times.Humans always remember things for how it made them feel. So, that's my take on that same point with this film.I will add this though...Robin Williams and Matt Damon: excellent chemistry and acting.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
The Incredibles," Groundbreaking Super Hero Movie
","I was a fan of the Incredible group when I was younger. When Disney decided to come out with this movie, I was ecstatic.I always found animation and fiction to be unbelievable. You knew it was going to be special since Pixar led the way on making this.All super hero movies I watched up until 'The Incredibles' were non-animation based. So, to see this presented in front of my eyes was astonishing. The fact that each character had their own distinct personality in the family that suited there super power was excellent too.On top of the drama, seriousness, and tension, there was always a tablespoon of comedy. I enjoyed the Incredibles so much. I always will....no matter how old I am.",10,0,0,9 May 2020
I Am Legend," Incredible
","Will Smith.Along side Jim Carrey and Robin Williams as my favorite actors is Will Smith.In an end of world scenario, Will Smith brings a great performance to the table. In a desolate area, with just his dog, he makes everything feel like it is actually happening.You feel bad for him at certain points and want the best to play out. And in the midst of COVID-19, as I write this review, the movie is somewhat relevant.Will Smith is a legend in 'I am Legend.' His movies always age like fine wine.And as always, big kudos to the film crew for the effects and cinematography in this one.",8,0,1,9 May 2020
Gran Torino," Appreciating Clint Eastwood More and More
","'Gran Torino'. Such a niche storyline but such a fascinating story to say the least.As I see more and more of Clint Eastwood's work, I am appreciating both his acting and directing.I believe he directed and performed in this one which is all the more fascinating.Great job Clint. Great job cast and crew.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Ex Machina," Immersive Storytelling and Visuals
","I am pretty blown away. In a movie that would seem to be simple to create and has a simplicity to its setting, it is actually complex and insightful.Maybe that's done purposefully for two reasons: first, so we can digest everything we're seeing with such an advanced topic....and two, so it can set a scene of utopia-type AI and human intelligence.Things are revealed in such a subtle fashion between Nathan and Caleb. And it's with those subtle revelations that the plot continues to escalate further and further.Wow. I'm going to meditate on this movie but I will say that it came at such a timely era and happening with the paradigm shift in our society.Also, in terms of the filmmaking, the usage of red and blues was excellent. The visuals was top notch (so, much deserving of their oscars awards) and the cast was phenomenal.Thanks for the recommendation Adam. This was amazing. A somewhat sign of the times.",9,0,1,10 May 2020
1917," One Shot Take!
","A one shot take amazed me. I've never seen a movie that has done this before. That was the thing that intrigued me the most.And I actually watched the behind the scenes of how they did it. Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes put in a tremendous amount of work to make every scene calculated. And I mean every scene. It was a step by step process to make sure the one shot take would be executed upon perfectly.And beyond the curtain of the filmmaking, the storyline was great. Having it be a one shot take made it a personal connection between the viewer and the two soldiers. It was a sad, yet uplifting and inspiring movie of showing a partially true story from a story that Sam Mendes grandfather told him about WWI.",8,2,3,8 May 2020
Million Dollar Baby," Great Film
","My Clint Eastwood appreciation goes on and on.One thing I remember from this movie was the stool on the corner of the ring. This is such a deep, emotional, and toughing story. It fits the mold of the cast who played each character.The filmmaking complements the theme as well. And for that reason it's an all around great film. But I can't give it above the 7 star line because certain things didn't check off for me and it was on the slower side.So, for my preference and observance in movies I give it a 6 star rating. Even if I put my interest aside, I would give it a 6.5 at most.Still.....great work cast and crew.",6,0,1,9 May 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Different Yet Excellent
","Quentin Tarantino has a different style of filmmaking. So, going into watching this movie I was slightly expecting what would come of it.But I was quickly taken on a rollercoaster of storytelling since the cinematography is different and the storyline is revealed to you in reverse.This action thriller is special and one that should be appreciated because there was definitely a ton of work that went into making it.The fight scene towards the end is one of the best I've ever scene.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
The Dark Knight," Profound Film
","(Writing this after I wrote 'The Incredibles' movie review)The Dark Knight is a distinct superhero movie in its own way. Batman is not one with super powers. The only 'super power' he has is his mind and resources.The darkness of Batman is interesting too because he moves in such a low-key manner. He never wants to be seen or never wants to be know for heroic acts. He is humble in his work. Yet, everyone knows who he Batman is and what he does. That's all the reason as to why he is a citizen behind his mask.This movie portrays what each human can be, beyond the fictional realm. Empowering, profound, action thrilled are first words that come to mind from 'The Dark Knight'.",9,0,0,9 May 2020
Friends with Benefits," Funny
",Funny with a twist of relatability and drama.Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunos come to the table with a stellar performance for this cliche and comical movie.Great job cast and crew.,6,2,2,10 May 2020
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Great Film
","I love true story films.My friend recommended I watch this and said it inspired him greatly. It definitely inspired me greatly, as well.I was hooked the entire time. Young Shia Labeouf did a great job and played the role of each emotional scene so well. I truly felt his emotions and struggles.The end scene was amazing. The fact that his father showed up to the final scene was unbelievable.",8,0,0,8 May 2020
Men in Black," Futuristic and Funny
","A movie like this has to have some seriousness to it in order to play out well. But the smooth connection between the two lead actors, Will and Tommy, also brings a flavor of well-fit comedy.As Will and Tommy play the roles of Jay and Kay as agents in a private, yet unofficial government agency, it complements the situation they are in.
It's a private (serious), yet unofficial (that's where the humor comes in) government agency.Just as Jackie Chan and Chris Rock have the good cop, funny cop role, so do Jay and Kay in 'Men in Black'.Great movie with great visuals.",6,0,0,9 May 2020

Up," A Classic Animated Movie
","'Up' is an absolute classic.This movie is so great. It has excellent animation, a beautiful storyline, and interesting characters.I love how relentless the little boy scout is and how much the older man transforms from this experience.As fictional as it is, Pixar did a great job of making it fell real and personal as always.Classic, classic, classic.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Snowden," Real and Entertaining
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings the heat on this film.I still remember the scene when Edward Snowden leaves the building with the needed data he wanted to expose the government m. My palms were sweating and it made me lean forward some more.The fact that this film is real is mind-boggling to me. It's a sort of documentary in and of itself too.Truly, truly great movie. It also shows the courage and strength of one individual who wore an invisible white hat to help others.",9,0,0,6 May 2020
Invincible," Another Great Philly Underdog
","True Story. Philadelphia. Underdog.All those things are reasons as to why I love 'Invincible'. Yes, the crew is excellent. But the fact it's an underdog from Philly who comes up the ranks to shock the world is so beautiful. I guess Philly has that taste to some of the true stories (a.k.a. Rocky).I appreciate the work ethic and conviction and humility behind Vince Papale.This was a gem of a movie that had me cheering alongside his friends in the stands at the end of the movie.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Rocky," Rocky!
","Living in Philly, I now appreciate Rocky and the city so much.A classic film from a young Sylvester Stallone that was up and coming in his acting career.The actual true story they based it off of - Rocky Balboa himself - is amazing.Rocky for life and Philly forever baby!I always run the Rocky steps on my runs. His presence as a character is so big in one city that it should show the magnitude of the film and how great it is, as well.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Pulp Fiction," Interesting!
","Quentin Tarantino has a way with his movies. It's such a different style than most directors.For that reason, it makes it all the better. It's not your normal take on a fictional film.'Pulp Fiction' is also interesting because it has four different scenarios intersect together. I remember when I first started watching the film, it was hard to keep up. But once I understood, I was able to digest the storytelling in full.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Titanic," Classic Through and Through
","Classic movie through and through. This movie is amazing. It allows for a great performance with the duo of two great performers.Sad, beautiful, heartfelt.And the one thing people don't appreciate is that it was told in the past tense.

It's a Wonderful Life," Wonderful.
","When I grew up, this was such an iconic movie for my parents.They always loved watching this movie during Christmas time. I don't even care that it is black and white. The storytelling is top tier!!!!!!If storytelling is great and it makes me think deeply, then a movie is great for that sole reason. Yes, I care about the cinematography, but the story is what I truly care about.'It's a Wonderful Life' was ahead of its time and that's why it is truly appreciated now. Thank you for this gem cast and crew.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Die Hard," Die Hard!
","The 'Die Hard' series is so iconic and whenever one hears the two words they know immediately what is being referred to.This film is packed with action, drama, and suspense. The viewer is put in a situation to root for John McClane. He is alone and battling a whole crew of enemies.The averageness of him being a NYC policeman makes it seem like a 'Dark Knight' type movie but without the super hero sense to it.This movie is so great that catch phrases came out of it that people still use to this day. Immediate classic.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
When Harry Met Sally...," Classic Romantic Movie
","This wasn't one of my favorites. I liked 'Harry' and 'Sally' in this movie, but yet again the story line just wasn't suiting for me.The push and pull with this one was great. The element of both ends of the romantic spectrum was enjoyable.",6,1,1,5 May 2020
Joker," Phenomenal Movie; Deep Dive into the Character of the Joker
","This movie really paints a deeper picture of the character of the Joker. It takes a more human view of the 2D Joker character that we all know of. The well-known dispute between Batman and Joker is more understood through this movie - even though Todd Phillips and the writers made it a little more detached from the traditional Joker character in order to give it a more human, realistic touch. The made up scenarios in the Arthur's head and the background of his life as to why he acts the way he does is all made clear through the 'Joker' movie.It's interesting too because on top of the great cinematography, writing, and acting from Joaquin Phoenix in the movie, Arthur Fleck (before he became Joker) definitely did his job. His mom said her son's purpose was to make people laugh and smile. He did that. Just in a different way. Just in an evil way.One thing to note - and I know I'll be reiterating what I said above - but it needs to be understood. This movie truly is different from any movie that is interconnected with the Avengers, Batman, or previous Joker movies. The 'Joker' movie I just watched, is a deep dive into the background of the Joker himself and it shows the spiral Arthur Fleck takes to join his alter ego: The Joker.This movie was talked about in high regards before I saw it. I now see why. Great work cast and crew.",9,2,2,17 May 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Jordan Belfort True Story
","Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill and cast come together to deliver a gem. Although, I don't align with Jordan Belfort and how he acted, the way the depicted Jordan's life (from rise to fall to rise) is pretty on point.Filmmaking was excellent too. Director Martin Scorsese does it again since he collabs with his favorite actor Leonardo DiCaprio.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
It Chapter Two," Stephen King Movie (Part II)
","It was great. No I mean 'It' was great.'It Chapter Two' was great but not as good as the first movie. That is solely my opinion though.I like how this 'It' incorporated a calling back of the younger versions that grew up in Derry, Maine. It's cool to see them face their fears as older individuals.That's the reason I gave it an 8. The metaphorical aspect of this movie is still as intact as the first.",8,2,6,9 May 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Hilarious and Entertaining

The Green Mile," Fascinating and Awesome
","I read the 'Green Mile' book for school when I was younger. It was excellent.And usually films have a tough time living up to the depth of a book. But 'Green Mile', the film, had met its potential in relation to the book.The relationship between the guards and the men in jail was an interesting duality.
The ending was one that I won't spoil either. All I'll say is it was great.",6,0,0,9 May 2020
Inception," One of a Kind is Right
","I just saw a review before I started typing that said 'a one of a kind mind blowing masterpiece.'It definitely is a masterpiece.This is the most complex storyline I've ever seen created. And then to make it into a film is an even harder thing to pull off. No wonder they had to bring in the best of the best for this one.I left watching this movie mind blown. I'll probably have to watch it back once more because I want to understand the plot and solution with more clarity.If I don't get something at first, that means it is damn good.",8,0,1,9 May 2020
WALL·E," Pixar Does it Again
","I remember reading a book that gave an example of creativity and talked about the process that the senior animators and creatives at Pixar used to come up with the WALL-E character.It was actually pretty lucrative. I believe that all the other characters and storyline were set for the movie, but they wanted to improve WALL-E's character. So, in a eureka like moment of insight at a baseball game, the top animator for Pixar was using binoculars at a baseball stadium since he couldn't see the game from a distance. It was at that moment, when using the binoculars, that the animator realized he can use binoculars as part of WALL-E's face.I learned this after the fact of watching the movie but still found it extremely fascinating from a creative standpoint.In terms of the actually movie, it was so amazing even though there was such minimal talking. That's difficult to execute, but only a studio like Pixar could pull it off.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," It Checks All the Boxes
","I love when stories provide all the answers towards the end of the film.Shawshank Redemption does exactly that and more.It has a feel good story, with amazing plots and twists, while also serving up suspense and entertainment.The filmmaking is tremendous, as well. And if I were to have a favorite scene in all of movie history, it would be when Andy falls out of the sewer pipe after crawling in filth to then scream in joy while rain pours on him. It symbolizes more than just escaping prison.
Such a beautiful scene.",10,0,0,29 April 2020

Creed II," Rocky IV was a Favorite
",Rocky IV was a favorite movie of mine in the Rocky series. It was great to watch Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver another great gem with this sequel.I loved the dessert scenes and the mimicking of Rocky II and III when Rocky had to be picked up by his trainer after getting to big for his own ego.Michael B. Jordan puts on a great performance and makes Creed II felt.,6,0,0,10 May 2020
Bruce Almighty," Another One!
","Jim Carrey with ANOTHER stellar act. With Jim Carrey being one of my favorite actors, this is one of my favorite films.The storyline is incredible and the filmmaking and visuals are extremely appealing. I love how there is a twist to each portion of the movie. For example, when Bruce Almighty gets prays from everyone now that he is God, but it goes through to his email.Super clever storytelling.",9,0,0,9 May 2020
Toy Story 3," Pixar Again!
","I write this as I write reviews for 'WALL-E' and 'Up' - both Pixar classics.The Toy Story series is excellent. And it is often hard to come out with one great sequel after another. Yet, Pixar executed so greatly.I enjoyed this one so much.",6,0,0,9 May 2020
Before Sunrise," The Ideal Romantic Movie
",This was a recommendation from a good friend of mine.He said it was his favorite romantic movie of all time. And I will say I enjoyed the storyline a ton.A quick trip from one man with a large dopamine effect of lustful love between a strangers he meets.It's the fictional European tale of lust that humans have preconceived notions of.,6,0,0,7 May 2020
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Top Tier (2)
",Hunger Games at it again.A great fictional movie in a follow up to Hunger Games: Mocking Jay.I enjoyed watching this a bunch.,6,0,1,9 May 2020
The Matrix," More Than Just a Movie
","My subject line fills up a majority of my takeaway from this 'fictional' movie.Keenu Reeves and the cast are stellar performers in this way. They show more than just a fictional tale of a computer hacker learning the reality of the world from rebels.This storyline shows the power of the mind and the ability we all have as human beings. I see the symbolism in this movie beyond just the surface of what is seen on the screen.I will also add that the filmmaking in the action scenes has to be, hands down, the best of any special effects I've ever seen in any movie.",10,1,1,8 May 2020
Green Book," Uplifting
","I watched this movie during Christmas two years ago (2018).It was so great because it brings about a topic that should always be talked about and revolutionized forward.Set in the Deep South in 1962, the personal connection that the two men form is a special one. At times you think they are pushing each other's limits, but it always comes from a good intentioned place of care and transparency.This film is more than just a film. It is uplifting and shows what relationships between anyone can be like.Great storyline. Great filmmaking. Thank you for this gem.",8,0,0,9 May 2020

A mix of sports and self-improvement that leads to the path of change for all players and the school.I love the underdog story. I love this movie because it shows what one coach/person can do to change many lives.The underdog to the best dog.,9,0,0,9 May 2020
Me Before You," Tug at the Heart Strings
","A poor class women and a rich, young man with 'a physical impairment' that eventually form a deep relationship through perseverance and courage.I loved watching The Untouchables, even though the genre is different, and that movie has a similar relationship aspect to it as Me Before You.I enjoyed watching this one with Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke.",6,0,0,5 May 2020
