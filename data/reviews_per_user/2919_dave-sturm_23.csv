Whip It," Outstanding Hollywood mainstream entertainment
","There are no bad movies containing 'Sheena Is a Punk Rocker' on the soundtrack and 'Whip It' is no exception. Drew Barrymore, in her directorial debut, has done everything right, right down to correctly showing that roller derby matches are attended by a few hundred fans in some warehouse, not thousands in an arena.Ellen Page, as the awkward outsider Bliss who finds her inner warrior (her nom de guerre is Babe Ruthless) on the derby track, is luminous. Barrymore's camera is in love with this young actress' incredibly expressive face. 'Hard Candy,' 'Juno' and now this. Is there anything this 22-year-old Canadian sparkplug cannot do? The script also does everything right and gives us characters that make sense. Bliss' mom, played by Marcia Gay Hardin, disapproves of her daughter's choice of extracurricular activity, but is just a worried mom, not some harridan. Her dad, played by Daniel Stern, is henpecked, but ends up taking his daughter's side. Also, it's broadly hinted that mom and dad are not estranged in the bedroom.Barrymore, who plays a member of the team, could easily have put herself out front, but chooses to stay in the background. SNL's Kristen Wiig is tough as nails on the track, but is also a single mom. And there's grinning Zoe Bell, recently seen flopping on a car hood in 'Death Proof.' 'Casablanca' was churned out as just another studio product when it was made, but certain stars come into alignment — script, cast, direction, etc., and a classic was born. 'Whip It' is not in that league, but the same principle applies. Fox Searchlight Pictures was a studio firing on all cylinders when it made 'Whip It.'",8,5,13,27 September 2009
Memento," Not what happens next, but what happens before
","Imagine you're in a bathroom and you see a bottle of whiskey. And you have to question whether that means you're drunk.Imagine a woman gets you so angry you hit her in the face and bloody her lip. She walks out of the room, but returns in a few minutes. You ask her who hit her and she tells you some other guy's name. You vow to punish that guy.Imagine you're running down the street. Some other guy is running too. At first you think you are chasing him. Then, he fires a gun at you and you realize you are the one being chased.This is Leonard's problem. He's out to find and kill the man who killed his wife. But he can't remember what happened five minutes ago. He uses notes, tattoos and Polaroids to keep track of information he has learned. But some of this information is wrong.And get this  Leonard's mission of revenge is told in scenes that are backwards-sequenced.Ingenious. That's the only word to describe this outstanding puzzle movie. Anyone unwilling to devote very close attention to a film should avoid this one. Those willing will find it immensely rewarding.I like highly contrived movies. Ironically, I'm not a big science fiction fan because I like the contrivances to be within the realm of present-day plausibility, if that makes any sense. If you share that sensibility, check out 'Memento.'",10,13,18,15 March 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Another cat yanked out of the bag
","A few thoughts: -- Christoph Waltz totally steals this movie, right up until the final scene where's he's squealing like a pig. He better get an Oscar nod.-- I kept thinking, Tarantino hasn't shown a woman's foot in this movie yet. And then came the shoe scene in the cinema office.-- QT movies are a lot like sex. Scenes build and build and build. And then all hell breaks loose in a matter of seconds.-- The scene in the tavern with two tables full of Nazis (or those disguised as Nazis) is absolutely brilliant sustained tension. This is a talented filmmaker at the top of his game.-- You can tell QT makes his movies to entertain himself. You, the audience, are just voyeurs. It's like he says, 'Here, you can watch it. I'm through with it now.' Another director who makes movies the same way is John Waters.-- By the final minutes, after two and a half hours, the audience is saying, you better pay off QT. Seriously, we expect a major scene. Don't leave us with some BS ironic ending. We want to see major nasties on Nazies.-- Oh, and blow stuff up.-- He totally delivers.",8,2,8,29 August 2009
Oldboy," Beautifully made fatuity
","Oldboy didn't work for me. It's pretension cranked up to 11. For some, I suppose, it's 'Look how the octopus struggles to survive even as it's being eaten. How rich a metaphor.' For me, it's more 'Whoa! Never saw that before!' Visually, it's a feast. The cinematography is something that will be pored over by film students for years. Park and his team love putting the camera overhead, like a God's eye view. But even the long pan on the fight scene just seems to scream, 'Look how cleverly we are filming this fight scene!' It just takes you out of the movie. Another fight it staged in a room full of glass stuff so that we can see artfully shot smashing glass.It's a meta-movie. A movie about movies. The vengeance plot, with it's big reveal at the end, seems like a dare it is so preposterous. 'We dare you to swallow this.' It's absurd in the way many opera plots are and I suppose, in that sense, it's over-the-topness should not matter. But it did to me.It also cops out at the end. What are we to think will be the future of Dae-su and the girl? What does the ecstatic look on his face mean? What is he anticipating? Park knows full well the audience is too embarrassed to admit it is thinking of one possibility, so it chooses a more noble motive.A more courageous director would have put a leer on his face.",3,6,14,27 August 2009
The Secret in Their Eyes," Senor Campabella, take a well-deserved bow
","It's a thriller. It's a love story. It's a puzzle movie. It's It's an acting tour de force. It's spectacular cinematography.It's a masterpiece.Going in, all I knew is that it was a highly regarded film from Argentina that won an Oscar. I know zip about Argentine cinema, but it's hard to believe a better movie has ever been made there.One thing Americans should know is that this 'foreign film with subtitles' is in no way, shape or form an 'art movie' loaded with ambiguity and other hoity toity stuff like that. This movie is the work of a master craftsman director working off a brilliant and intricate thriller script.The narrative unfolds in interspersed scenes involving the same people, but 25 years apart. It's the same actors and characters, but youthful in some scenes and with wrinkles and gray hair in others.The plot turns on the aftermath of a brutal rape and murder of a beautiful young wife. Front and center throughout the movie are Benjamin, the passionate young investigator for whom this particular case is one he cannot set aside, and Irene, his colleague (it was a little unclear to an American what their professional relationship was) who clearly is drawn to his passion and has feelings for him, even though she is engaged to someone else (offscreen).Two shots must be discussed. First, there's THE shot. Anyone who has seen it will know exactly what I mean. It's a one-take (seemingly, but not really — it would be impossible without CGI) tracking shot involving a chase in a packed soccer stadium. The second much-discussed shot is only about a minute long and happens in an elevator, but you will not breathe during that incredibly tense minute.Lots of credit goes to the secondary actors, who portray a law clerk with a drinking problem, the perpetrator of the crime, a hapless intern, a weaselly judge and the devastated husband of the victim.The ending is an elegantly shown series of reveals. The next-to-last sequence totally screws with your mind. I kid you not, it's a shocker and it comes out of nowhere. Then comes the grand finale with Benjamin and Irene in the touching end scene.You will leave the theater simultaneously with a chill down your spine and a lump in your throat.",10,15,18,29 May 2010
Superbad," I'm telllin' ya ... kids today!
","I am 58 years old and when I watch teen comedies it's with a certain curiosity about how it's different today in high school. Despite stereotypes of the Sixties, back then teens wanted to look and act as adult as possible. In the suburbs at least, you dressed sharp. The main thing was to be 'cool' and act like you were more sophisticated than you really were. We drank and smoked pot at parties and danced to the Stones and swore and got into arguments about Vietnam. But we were never candid about really personal things, like sex. You were hip, man, but dignified.A lot has apparently changed. For one thing, the idea of boys taking home economics these days is really amazing. I think 'Superbad' is a terrific movie with great dialogue and some uproarious scenes. To wit:The liquor store fantasy scenes.Fogel's new license.The drunk fat kid crashing into Jules.Fogel's 'arrest me' request.Carrying booze in a detergent jug.The mom's-cleavage gag. 'I am so jealous ...'I also really liked the shanghaied-to-a-weird-adult-party scene. This was so real-life I was actually startled. Period blood on his pants! And everyone wants to see it! And her boyfriend is outraged! I thought the guys were doomed. And those sing-for-us cokeheads  so bizarre it had to come from someone's real experience. You would never see something like this in a previous teen-sex comedy.The only letdown was the two cops. Come on. Those scenes in the middle of the movie should have been rewritten or cut. Imagine Fogel protected under the wing of two bad-ass Clint Eastwood types with street scores to settle and you can see where it should have gone.'Superbad' gets props for being original and taking chances. It also has an essential sweetness that separates it from 'American Pie,' which is not a bad movie but suffers in comparison to this one. Let's have more, Judd.",8,0,3,18 March 2008
Juno," Pretend it's an obscure movie no one ever heard of
","Bring an agenda to 'Juno' and it's not going to work for you. If you want to hear dialogue that sounds 'real,' stay home. Compare it to the hype, and be ready to be let down. And don't expect it to be 'Knocked Up.''Juno' is a confection. It's a cotton candy movie. It's really just a fleeting moment in time when the radiant Ellen Page happened to intersect with a witty script by Diablo Cody. It trades on charm. Nothing else.There are no lessons here, no real meaning. The peak emotional line in the movie is 'He is the cheese to my macaroni.' Yet it works. Juno on her bike with the guitar strapped to her back saying that line just did me in. If you cannot see why that is, you are blind and deaf to movie art.BTW, having seen 'Hard Candy,' a completely different kind of movie, I can say Ellen Page is a force to be reckoned with.",9,1,4,18 March 2008
Shutter Island," A dazzling mess
","Acting? Top notch. Cinematography? Perfect. Grotesque images? In spades. Foreboding music? You bet. Gothic atmosphere? Ooo-eee-ooo.The problem here is the story and the way it is told. I had read Dennis Lehane's novel going in and knew the basic arc of the story and the big reveal at the end, but this version stuffs way too much into a relatively simple mystery story. Shutter Island could be ... THIS! Or it could be ... THAT! Or it could be ... SOME OTHER AWFUL THING! And why do we need World War II flashbacks? What do Nazis and Holocaust victims add to the story, except to give Scorcese a chance to show mournful starving Jews, a pile of bodies topped by a heartbreaking little dead girl clutching at her dead mother and an, admittedly masterful, tracking shot of Nazis being mowed down by righteous GIs. Take that, Quentin.And here's a small annoyance. As the GIs enter what is clearly stated as Dachau concentration camp, which is in Germany, we see the famous arch that says, 'Arbeit macht frei' (work sets you free). Trouble is, that arch isn't at Dachau, it's at Auschwitz, which is in Poland. Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. Why can't Scorcese leave well enough alone? Things are over amplified. You can't just show a Nazi commandant's office, it has to be full of blowing paper. You can't just have stormy weather, it has to be a raging hurricane. You can't just show a woman living in a cave, you have to be sure we see the canned rations and canteen of water that keep her alive. Things to marvel at, for sure, but ultimately distracting.After a while, it's hard to tell when U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leo DiCaprio) is hallucinating and when he is not. In one scene, he wakes up from a bad dream and immediately begins hallucinating ... or is it more of the bad dream? Hmm. One can almost hear Scorcese say, 'Hey, let's not just blow up a car, let's put Teddy's hallucinated wife and daughter into the explosion!' Taken together, these things cause a lot of suspense to drain out of the movie and it ends up being a gorgeously made creep-out flick.",5,16,33,21 February 2010
The Orphanage," 'One, two three, knock on the wall'
","Mild spoilers ahead.In these days of J-horror and K-horror and torture porn and zombie comedies, it is wonderful to come across something as classic as this. This is about as artfully made a horror movie you are going to find. Which doesn't mean it skimps on the scares. In fact, there's a scene involving an old lady pushing a baby carriage that made me jump right out of my seat -- twice! The movie opens in what is obviously the most cheerful orphanage in the history of the world. Girls are playing and giggling in bright sunshine. The building is a beautiful manor. That's when we learn that one of the girls, red-headed Laura, is about to be adopted. What unfolds is Laura's story.After the orphanage scene, we cut straight to Laura at age 37. She's married to a doctor and they have an adopted son, age 7. The three of them are all back at the orphanage, now abandoned. The family has acquired the manor (which still looks pretty good) with the intent of reopening it as a home for disabled children.Simon, their son, has two imaginary friends, something which his parents tolerate. Suddenly, after moving to the orphanage, he announces he has five additional made-up friends, one of whom seems to live in a cave on the beach (the manor is at the sea shore).When the disabled children show up for a welcoming lawn party, the kids are given masks to wear (purchased, by the way, at the Deeply Disturbing Mask Store). Inside the house, Laura and her son have a loud argument and she slaps him.Shortly afterward, Laura is attacked by a masked child wearing one of the old-fashioned orphan dresses. The child runs off. It is then that we learn that Simon has disappeared.The remainder of the movie is the search for Simon, who Laura is convinced is still in the house. There is a seance in which a horrifying moment in the orphanage's history is revealed. Clues are dropped. Strange dolls turn up. Doors slam shut. What does this doorknob laying on the floor open? Laura's husband becomes exasperated by her behavior and insists they leave. Laura begs for more time. He says two days, then he leaves.With Laura now alone in the house, the movie kicks into overdrive.I cannot say enough about Belen Rueda as Laura, who is on screen 90 percent of the movie. She has huge expressive eyes that show love, fear, passion and determination. An incredible performance.I also want to call attention to the use of foreshadowing in this movie. If any movie cries out to be watched twice, this is one. Little things happen early that you could miss, but which pay off huge later on.Finally, the ending. It took a while to dawn on me what was actually happening, but once it did my heart was in my throat and I was on the verge of tears. The husband has the final scene and it's incredibly elegant and touching.This is, of course, a Spanish movie and some posts I read here advise that orphanages have a deep resonance in Spanish culture. They were filled up with the children of parents that had been imprisoned or shot for being opposed to Dictator Franco. They were not, as you might imagine, nurturing places for children.This movie is for all time.",9,5,9,23 September 2009
American Beauty," Unsweet suburbia
","'American Beauty' is a fine movie, but multiple viewings reveal some cracks, mostly having to do with contrivances. For example, the two Jims are clearly in the movie simply to fend off charges of homophobia resulting from the ending. Also, Lester and his wife are set up to be too diametrically opposite  she worships success and he basically drops out and 'goes hippie' when he loses his job. Wouldn't it have been cooler if she was the one secretly smoking pot? Col. Fits' hatred for his son is too much. It's just implausibly ferocious, especially given his son's serene response. Angela's slutty dialogue gives away what we later find out about her. The movie plays so many diversion games that you start to see them coming, right up to the violent ending.Still, it's all well-acted and clever and funny and a great example of the all-American suburban satire.",8,1,4,2 June 2008
Wanted," Brainless fun
","This movie makes no sense. Holy sh*t is it fun!I don't read graphic novels. I generally don't like movies made from graphic novels or comic books.However, I have a powerful ability to suspend disbelief. And this is the greatest suspend- disbelieve movie of 2008.Angelina Jolie is named ... wait for it ... Fox! With a twist of the wrist, bullets fly around corners! A fraternity of assassins that is a thousand years old has discovered binary code! Total losers are really heirs to the fraternity! By being constantly beat up, your assassination instincts will emerge and you can shoot down bullets aimed at you with your own bullet! And you can enlist an army of exploding rats as your personal army! And the best way to invade the castle of your enemy is to run in and grab the guns dropped by people you have just shot!What's not to love?I like it that action movies are moving into absurd territory. People might see themselves in The Godfather. Nobody will see themselves in Wanted. Unless they are insane.",8,5,9,29 June 2008
Salt," Ridiculous but fun
","Russian spies? How retro. How old school. Ha ha.Oh, wait, didn't they arrest a bunch recently?Lots of potential in rebooting the old Cold War Paranoia trope. 'Salt' mostly squanders that potential to be a flat-out car-crash and punch-out actioner. Nothing wrong with that. Pass the popcorn.Posts here reference the Bourne and Bond movies in describing 'Salt,' but the movie it reminded me most of is 'The Fugitive.' 'Salt' is one long improbable chase as our CIA agent protagonist Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) runs around Washington and New York trying to clear her name and prevent the assassination of the Russian president, who's in town to attend the funeral of the American vice president.The entire movie is a series of escape set pieces. Her escape from the CIA office. The chase on foot through the streets of D.C. The escape from her apartment. Inside the cathedral during the funeral. Her escape after being arrested. Her escape from the barge. And, finally, her escape from the helicopter.The movie delays letting on whether Salt is a goodie or a baddie. I was not fooled. For all the cops, Secret Service, CIA, FBI, etc., she took on — beating them up, breaking their bones, knocking them unconscious, shooting them in the arm — she never kills a single one. What does that tell you?BTW, how did she get out of that interrogation room in the beginning?A franchise being set up and I think we can anticipate the return of Evelyn Salt, a new movie avenger against a team of men and women trained from childhood, in a secret compound in Russia, to become CIA agents. At the same time, Salt will remain a hunted woman in America. I anticipate the moment in the next film when she tells her boss over the phone, 'You look tired. Why don't you get some rest.'On display here is one of Hollywood's newest action gimmicks -- Salt is coming at a guy to deliver a punch, but first she runs up the wall.The franchise needs a thrilling theme song, something like the Bourne movies' 'Extreme Ways' by Moby.I would have given this 6 instead of 7 stars, but the movie contains the wildest strangulation scene in the history of cinema.",7,3,11,24 July 2010
Control," The awful truth
","I'm an American from Baltimore who used to be a rock critic for my Pennsylvania newspaper back in the eighties. I read an article in the New York Times by rock critic Robert Palmer (not the musician) headlined 'Truly Compelling Rock and Roll.' It discussed two bands, Joy Division the the Feelies.I immediately bought records by both bands and was blown away. (The Feelies deserve a special article of their own and this is not the place).Ian Curtis' sepulchral vocals immediately struck me on 'Closer.' I didn't even know he was already dead. I read in the Village Voice how he had hanged himself and was absolutely baffled. How could this voice be gone? I consider 'Decades' the greatest accomplishment of a British art band. And I'm a fan of Bowie, Roxy and Peter Gabriel.Watching this movie, I see all the stuff that crushes rock. I did not know Ian Curtis had a seizure condition. I did not know his conflicted romantic situation. I did not even know how much his personal life played into his music.British vs. American rock. Where do you fall? False dichotomy. Are the Brits an echo, a mirror, a copy? No, they are an enhancement, a different vision. They return the favor.Samantha Morton as Ian's wife. Wonderful. One of our great actresses. Check her out in 'Minority Report.'Rock music is about a special kind of talent. It has little to do with actual skill with an instrument. It is democratic. It is shamanistic. Ian Curtis had it.RIP, Ian.",8,3,4,20 February 2009
The Usual Suspects," Is that it????
","This is an interesting thriller with a fatal flaw. The flaw lies in the point of view. People who love it think that the flashbacks and other information being given the police are being presented in good faith. They are not. It's all Verbal's POV. And he is lying.Movies like 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others,' which contain huge twist endings, also use POV to divert the audience. But in those cases, the POV which we see is sincere. The characters in the movie whose POV we use are convinced it is true. They are MISTAKEN. We are shocked at the end and the reason is that the characters whose narrative we have followed are also shocked. Kaiser Soze is hardly shocked at the revelation of who he really is. My reaction was more 'oh' than 'Whoa!' His limping was fake!!!Come on.",4,4,7,15 March 2008
District 9," A landmark in sci fi cinema
","Everyone here is posting about how sensational 'District 9' is and they are all correct. I won't go on about the plot or the political themes in the movie.But, some observations: As the movie begins, you share the Joburgers disgust with the Prawns, who are shown urinating in public, digging through garbage and acting obnoxious. They look like walking lobsters. One is shown absurdly wearing a pink bra. Then something happens and the audience reverses course. And I can tell you the moment it happens. It's in the lab when they are testing with Wikus' hand/claw on the alien weapon. They bring in a hapless alien with an X painted on his back and put him up against a wall. You can see that the poor creature is terrified. You think, oh no, they aren't gonna do what I think they're gonna do. They are. Wikus refuses to cooperate and is screaming, but the lab docs force him. I submit that this is the most important moment in the movie because the aliens are put in a whole new light and the audience now takes their side.Meanwhile, audience disgust shifts to the MNU mercs, who drive around in armored vehicles blowing up aliens. They snarl all their dialogue.As the movie progresses from here, we get to know the main alien, who is not called Mongo or Zorg, but Christopher Johnson. Note: His first name contains the word Christ and his last name is pure Anglo-Saxon. He has a small son who's kinda cute. Also, he walks and stands like a man, not like other aliens who tend to sway. And he's a scientist out to rescue his species. We are so on this guy's side.Wikus' character arc is this movie is amazing. He goes from preening twit in the beginning to a rampaging warrior at the end. Tremendous performance. I want to see more of this actor.The CGI on display here sets a new standard.Parts of D9 will remind you of lots of other movies, but mark my words, in the future it will be other movies that remind you of D9.Add to this an ending that will bring a lump to your throat and you have one for the history books.And there'd better be a sequel because there's plenty of unfinished business.",10,3,8,19 August 2009
2012," 'Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair.'
","OMG, there's George Segal! Holy moly, he must be in his 70s by now. He was a leading man back in the day, one of Hollywood's most promising up and comers. He was even in 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Now, here he is in a bit part as a musician on a vacation cruise liner. He's all craggy and old now, but it's good to see him alive and well and ....Uh, I guess we should talk about the movie. The world goes blooey! The end. Actually, there's more to discuss, but that's the whole plot in a nutshell. If that's not what you want in a movie, better steer clear.This movie should have ended showing 500 people all taking a bow. That's the army it took to bring this CGI catastrophe epic to the screen. Think of all of them taking their families to the opening and being able to say, 'See the part where the tsunami tosses the aircraft carrier on top of the White House? I had a hand in that.' The kid replies, 'Gosh mom, you rock!' I've always heard about the earthquake where one day California slides into the ocean. It's clear the filmmakers said, 'Everyone has heard that California one day will slide into the ocean. Let's actually show it.' And they do! If you see this movie you will see Malibu (or maybe Venice Beach) tilt up and slide right into the waves.In the trailer, you see all these gigantic catastrophes and might think you're seeing the end of the movie. You are not. That all happens about halfway through. The first half hour of the movie is set-up. It all begins in 2009 (whoa, the same year as the movie's release!). Scientists discover things going on deep underground that 'just can't be true.' Warnings are sounded. Governments are put on alert. Then 2012 arrives and fissures appear, the surface of the earth begins to collapse, buildings fall ... It looks like mankind itself will not make it. But ... and then comes the second half of the movie, which I will not reveal. But I'll hint — the species survives.What do you see get destroyed? Southern California, of course. Las Vegas. Yellowstone National Park. East India. Washington, D.C. Tibet. What am I leaving out ...Star John Cusack has a movie family. He's estranged from his wife. His little son and daughter have issues. Mom's seeing the plastic surgeon neighbor, who ends up a key character. Woody Harrelson (Hi Woody! Loved Zombieland!) chimes in as a crazy hippie prophet who gives info to Cusack so he's one step ahead as events go south. There's a superrich Russian oligarch (the movie's more or less bad guy). A brave Russian pilot. A sympathetic Russian bimbo mistress (whose fate is shamefully glossed over). There's also the president's chief of staff played by Oliver Platt who's basically doing a take on Henry Kissinger at his most Strangelovian.Roland Emmerich, all along you've been the guy who when Hollywood comes around and says, 'Roland, will you take all the money in Switzerland and make the most eyepoppingest movie imaginable?' has always modestly said, 'Why, yes.' Here's to you.",7,1,5,14 November 2009
Children of Men," what polarity in reviews!
","spoiler alertHow wildly divergent are the opinions about this movie. Amazing. This is a movie I've seen twice now and intend to see again. It bowled me over. One of the times I saw it was with my college-age daughter and she didn't care for it. The reasons she didn't like it are parallel to many negative comments here, to wit:'Why is this happening to humans?' There is no 'why.' It's simply a literary premise, perhaps based on mankind's ill treatment of the earth. Note that it has not affected the animals.'No closure at the end.' The curtain after the final scene shocked me a bit at first, too, but the more I thought about it, it was the perfect ending. The risks will not end. The idea of Kee and baby being hustled through the ship with a crowd of doting docs and nurses as the music rises and we see she has finally reached safety, a tear for Theo running down her cheek. How CORNBALL is that?????? Some people just hate ambiguity.'It's not like the novel.' Fair enough. I have not read the novel, but from what I understand it veers sharply from the book. Stephen King once said he's never upset when movies of his books go off in another direction. He considers the movies separate entities. It's not like the movies replace the books.'Were the Fishes supposed to be good or bad?' Neither. Probably started out good, but the decision to off Julian and keep Kee and use her for political leverage in England turned them bad. Despite the sci-fi trappings, this movie is really about a wrecked loser being handed a mission and getting a chance for redemption. But he's not Bruce Willis. He never picks up a gun. He's wearing flip flops. He picks a car that doesn't start. He never cracks wise. He wears a shabby raincoat throughout the movie. He's terrified and confused. His main good point, and what keeps pulling his chestnuts out of the fire, is that he's trustworthy. And to conclude, my friends, the awesome unbroken shot during the ambush in the woods, shot entirely from the inside of the car, is worth the price of mission alone. Check the extras in the DVD to see how they did it.",9,3,9,18 February 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Differences between book and movie
","This is only intended for Americans who have just now seen the subtitled Swedish movie, which only opened this weekend, and have not read the book and are curious if the two differ.The movie is about 95 percent faithful to the novel. Having read the novel, I was surprised how true the movie was to Stieg Larsson's intricate, but understandable, plot.But there are differences.For one thing, Erika Berger, who is a major character in the novel, is merely depicted as the person in charge of the Millennium magazine's office. She's the attractive middle aged woman who kisses Blomqvist after following him as he leaves the office early in the movie. In the book, she and Blomqvist have been having a torrid affair for years. And she is married. And her husband tolerates the affair (those Swedes!).This has a significant impact on the ending of the novel. What is not depicted in the movie is that Lisbeth Salander has fallen in love with Blomqvist by the end and goes out to buy him a very thoughtful gift for when he gets out of prison. But when she approaches his place with the gift, she sees him and Erika coming out of his apartment laughing, kissing, arm-in-arm. It breaks Lisbeth's heart to see this and she tosses the gift into a Dumpster. That's how the novel ends.The part about Lisbeth spending her stolen fortune on a tropical vacation is actually the beginning of the second novel, 'The Girl Who Played with Fire,' which sends Salander and Blomqvist off on a new adventure a year after the end of events in the first novel.'Dragon Tattoo' contains intriguing hints about Salander's early life. Why was she in a mental hospital? Who was the man she set on fire? All this is explained in the second novel, 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' as we learn all about Salander's ugly life story. And believe me, it is ugly. If any woman in fiction has earned the right to vengeance, it is Lisbeth Salander.I have read all three in the Millennium trilogy. I can testify that if you liked 'Dragon Tattoo,' book or movie, you will love 'Played With Fire,' which is the best of the three novels and the most action packed.The third novel, 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,' is actually a sequel to 'Played with Fire.' In fact, 'Hornet's Nest' begins at the moment 'Played with Fire' ends.The last two novels have already been filmed in Sweden and await release in the U.S. And as we know now, 'Dragon Tattoo' is due for an American remake for release in 2012. Presumably, Hollywood will also film the entire trilogy.I seen postings bemoaning an American remake. I am not among them. I envision six movies featuring Lisbeth Salandar and, to me, that's pure bliss. One down, five to go.How tragic that Stieg Larsson cannot give us another book. He died of a heart attack before he even saw the publication of his trilogy, much less see his writings become the stuff of fiction and movie legend.",9,5,10,3 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," Go to the bathroom before seeing
","'Paranormal Activity' is the little movie that snuck into town in October of 2009 and made everyone pee their pants. I saw it with a fairly large audience and I suggest you do the same because audience reaction is a big park of this movie's experience.The movie starts fairly slowly as we are introduced to Micah and Katie, a young couple living together in a house in San Diego. Nice house, even has a pool. He's a day trader and she's a student. He's kind of immature and full of himself. She's introspective.As everyone knows by now, this is a 'found footage' movie a la 'Blair Witch Project' as we see what Micah's video camera picks up over the course of several days as he tries to document the ghost or demon that has been bothering Katie since she was 8.The camera rolls while they sleep and we see little things. A door moves a couple inches. Another night, a light goes on the hallway, then goes out. Then, more happens. A whole lot more.The movie is almost entirely Micah and Katie. She has a girlfriend who drops in. They invite a ghostbuster-type psychic, who totally wimps out and hightails it.The movie has a kind of pulse â€” safety during the daytime awake scenes, followed by excruciating tension during the sleeping scenes when you have no idea what you will see or hear.Whatever is haunting Katie is attached to her, not the house. So moving would not solve the problem. As the movie progresses, fear turns to terror and she becomes all but immobilized.As the jump moments built and built, the audience moaned and yipped. A few screamed out loud. The final 10 minutes had them gripping their armrests.I have learned that three different endings were shot. No doubt they will be included in the DVD. As for the one used, it delivered the movie's biggest shock and it sure worked for me.As we filed out of the theater, one teenage girl, visibly rattled, said she was sure she would not be able to sleep that night.This is an instant classic, destined to take a place at or near the top of the list of the most frightening movies ever made.",9,0,2,12 October 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Ah, the Sam Raimi-ness of it all
","Sam Raimi's booga-booga-booga approach to horror film-making is on glorious display here, with lots of smash zooms, grotesque corpses and assorted awful fluids and maggots flung into someone's face. He is the master. Eli Roth cannot carry Sam's lunch.Some thoughts: -- Alison Lohman does a fine job in the lead. But I think Ellen Page, who turned down the role, would have been even better. Watch 'Hard Candy' if you disagree.-- Raimi must have searched the world over to find a kitten with extra cuteness for the movie's most controversial, but also one of the funniest, scenes.-- OMG, that stupid-looking goat.-- The scene at the gypsy funeral with the body crashing on top of our heroine, and then LEAKING INTO HER MOUTH. Funniest thing I've seen all year.-- Lohman's chops on full display when she vents her rage in the graveyard scene. Whoa.-- The floating guy at the seance? Not scary, just dumb.-- The bloody nose scene. It's a gusher! Kleenex please! -- I was waiting to see if Raimi would cop out at the end. No he doesn't. Heh heh.BTW, never let an old gypsy lady pull a button off your coat.",8,2,4,30 May 2009
Inception," Breathtaking masterpiece or $500 wallet?
","I'm gonna go with the former, although something in my brain pan keeps coming back to the movie's casual mention (twice) that the rich and powerful central figure who is the target of Cobb's team of dream invaders carries a $500 wallet. Who would pay that much for a wallet? I mean, what could a wallet have that would make it worth that much? I couldn't shake this question about money foolishly spent.Watching this, admittedly, amazingly entertaining but absurdly complicated movie does make you stop and say, 'Wait a minute, I want to see the flow chart.' Plot points race past at breakneck speed. Do they go down three or four dream levels? Why did Leo inception his wife? Was the eroding seashore city limbo? Why were they all tied together and floating in the elevator? How did Cobb 'betray' the team with memories of his wife?Perhaps repeat viewings will make all this clear. If anything, Inception is a movie that will have audiences back for a second viewing to try and clear things up.In a word, Inception is a movie that has its way with you. You are helpless in its clutches. A freight train crashing through rush hour traffic? Check. Siege of a mountain fortress with avalanche thrown in for good measure? Check. Paris folds in on top of itself? Check. Volcanic Hans Zimmer soundtrack? Check.Oh, and machine gun warfare. Lots of machine gun warfare.And then there's that hotel hallway fight. Whoa. One for the books.",9,4,7,16 July 2010
The Runaways," The latest of two versions
","This is an entertaining film version of The Runaways story. I say version because there is another film on this band called 'Edgeplay,' which complements this movie perfectly. Essentially, 'The Runaways' is Joan Jett's and Cherie Currie's version of things. In 'Edgeplay,' which is a documentary, the rest of the band has its say.But let's discuss 'The Runaways.' Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Jett is phenomenal. She's got the slouchy guitar playing, the gum chewing, the swagger and the foggy voice nailed. Jett is all girl and quite pretty, but she's always had the manner of a boy. Stewart gets it right. She is not just twitchy Bella, for sure.If you've ever seen the real Kim Fowley (you can on YouTube), you will see that Michael's Shannon's portrayal of him is not at all over the top. In fact, many who knew him would probably say this depiction is too forgiving to the bizarre monster Fowley really was.Dakota Fanning acquits herself well as Currie, the band's sexpot singer. The movie gives Currie the only family backstory, probably because the movie is based on her memoir 'Neon Angel.' It would have been interesting to see Jett's back story depicted. The movie might leave you thinking she's a native Californian, but she didn't move there with her family until she was a teenager. She was born in Philadelphia and spent her childhood in Maryland.Some may question things that happen in this movie. Did they really write 'Cherry Bomb' on the spot for Currie's audition? Did Fowley really teach the girls to dodge garbage thrown at them on stage? Did the Japanese really go THAT apesh*t over the band? Yes to all. Watch 'Edgeplay,' where these and other facts about the band are discussed by the girls (now women in their forties) themselves in 2004. (The doc is available for instant viewing on Netflix.) This movie was made by Vicki Blue, one of the band's bass players (the actual band went through five bassists, which is why the bass player in 'The Runaways' is a fictional creation called 'Robin').I have my gripes with 'Edgeplay,' mostly about the jittery camera-work, which I guess is supposed to be edgy, but is just pretentious and annoying. But it is the truth behind the 'truth.' 'The Runaways' makes no mention of Currie's abortion while in the band or bass player Jackie Fox's suicide attempt. In 'Edgeplay,' Fox, now a lawyer, even displays the scar on her wrist. 'The Runaways' makes clear that these teenage girls fought. 'Edgeplay' gets into why. In the doc, it is also stated openly that some of them were having sex with each other (and it wasn't just Jett and Currie). Hey, it was the Seventies.Joan Jett declined to participate in 'Edgeplay,' despite the fact she is portrayed in a mostly positive light as perhaps the most ambitious, talented and level-headed member of the band. I was a bit shocked that at the end of 'The Runaways' when you get the obligatory 'what happened to them' text on the screen, only Jett, Currie and Fowley are mentioned.The most shameful omission here is the tragic Sandy West, the band's doggedly devoted drummer and perhaps the best female drummer in the history of rock (well, maybe until the Go Go's Gina Schock arrived). She and Jett essentially started the band, as shown in 'The Runaways.' Her history after the band broke up is sad. She was reduced to construction work. Her post-band life was one of drug using, drug dealing, guns and jail. She died of cancer in 2006, but in 'Edgeplay' you can see her two years before her death discussing the breakup of the band, which clearly broke her heart. She never recovered.It is also wrong to ignore Lita Ford's post-Runaways modest success as a solo rock artist. She's also the most entertaining interviewee in 'Edgeplay.' All in all, I have praise for both movies. Both are candid portrayals of the first all-girl band in rock history, paving the way for the Go Go's, L7, Bikini Kill and, perhaps the most talented of all, Sleater-Kinney, a band that has also broken up, but in a much more friendly way.You go, girl rockers!",7,153,173,11 April 2010
Atonement," Writers lie to us
","I read the novel before seeing the movie so I knew what I was going to see. Ian MacEwan's book is about how writers always cheat. You really should know that going in because I think a lot of people expected 'Ryan's Daughter' or some other sweeping historical romance that may end tragically, but movingly. The ending of 'Atonement' is not tragic. It is absurd. In a way, the movie ending copped out. The book ended with an internal monologue by Briony at her own crowded, happy birthday party. The book reveals her own pretensions to have given Robbie and Cecelie 'a life together' when in fact she really just wrote a happy ending to alleviate her own guilt. It's pathetic and shows how Briony is still the selfish brat she always was. And there was no final scene on the beach in the book. The book is deeply, deeply bitter. It's wrong to slap on a fantasy-on-the-beach ending.Still, most of the movie was captivating, what with the masterful tracking shot, the musical typewriter. The suburban American audience I saw it with gasped out loud when they saw Robbie's typewriter slam out the most taboo word in the English language. David Lean 'Atonement' is not.Ian MacEwan writes fairly transgressive fiction. Too bad the filmmakers weren't willing to go the distance.",8,1,1,26 April 2008
