Angels & Demons," Your average thriller
","For me, this is one of the rare cases that doesn't call I-read-the-book-movie-sucks evaluation. Indeed, the screenplay cherry picks the reasonable parts of Brown's story omitting the nonsense in the book. With most action pulled by Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer's character seems like a filler for a female cast. To make things worse, Zurer acts more like a lab technician than a top notch physicist. The plot is simplistic and predictable. If you read Dan Brown's other books or saw Da Vinci code, it won't take you long to figure out the twists and the villain. Some nice scenes from Rome are the redeeming qualities of an otherwise average popcorn flick. This is not a thriller that will blow you away but will probably entertain you on a lazy Friday night.",6,0,1,11 September 2018
Marie Antoinette," A better storytelling is still in the waiting
","This movie seems about setting the records straight for one of the most misunderstood historical characters. It starts well with Antoinette's girlhood and her introduction to the French court as the Austrian bride. But then it drags on about her vanities, bitter marriage, her addiction to gambling and lavish lifestyle by completely missing the point that she lived at a time which makes up one of the most interesting historical turning points of the mankind. Only at the end of the movie, the revolution is depicted with an angry mob carrying pitchforks and sickles in a perfunctory manner. Indeed, her last years in the dungeon after her arrest are completely ignored, which could be a much more interesting subject than her superfluously narrated court life.Add to that, the pop soundtrack in the first half sounds too cheesy and turns a potentially historical gem into a chick-flick. The only positive side is the superb acting by Kirsten Dunst, who almost single-handedly saves the movie from a complete train wreck. Ironically, this also emphasizes the fact that she was alone in the leading role with a very obscure portrayal of her husband.",4,0,0,30 April 2018
The Ring," Typical horror flick
","The movie must certainly be a feast for the eyes of horror film lovers with all its tension and suspense. However, it can't escape the cliches by touching all the twisted imagination buttons ever created throughout the movie history. As a person who has done with supernatural crap long time ago, I expected some intelligence after seeing Naomi Watts on the cast. Indeed, she was the reason for me to spare some time for this genre but the end result was total disappointment. The part involving the research about Anne Morgan looked promising for a while but towards the finale, nails coming off the walls by themselves, a zombie girl climbing out of a well and then coming out of a CRT screen to scare people to death... Those were all too much occults marring a flimsy story which was struggling to be coherent up to that moment anyway. I also read that the director initially wanted to avoid big names from the cast with the idea of movie being discovered by itself (well, if you believe it...) Sorry for dashing your dreams pal, but this is just another run off the mill horror flick who'd never find this much success but for Watts. As for the movie itself, the storytelling is patchy and lacks cohesion. Some reviewers complain about the lack of character development but I guess this would be too much to expect from a horror movie, anyhow. I should finally give the director some credit that by using blood and gore sparingly, he acted wisely enough to jack up the creepiness level a notch high.",5,0,2,1 April 2018
Se7en," A dark psyco-thriller at its best
","A veteran detective counting his days to retirement and a rookie officer hungry for success and glory team up to hunt down a serial killer who refers to seven deadly sins in his gruesome murders. There's not a specific setting for the city where the drama unfolds except that it's a metropol area. The movie is perfect in directing, editing, acting and cinematography. Dark indoor scenes and narrow gloomy alleys shot under overcast and rainy skies fit very well with the brooding theme of the movie. Despite some intensive chase scenes and violence, Seven is not an action packed movie. Although it's technically classified as a crime thriller the psychological aspects of the main characters are emphasized. Some reviewers describe it as a slow paced movie but it is not. The scenes involving character development are as captivating as those with gun fights and rooftop chases. The tempo is successfully balanced in subplots but the tension is never lost and the movie never gets boring. While horrid murder scenes aren't for fainthearted they can't be compared to cartoonish blood and gore extravaganza in Tarantino's movie caricatures. Like all other scenes, the director D. Fincher uses them in moderation to instill terror in the audience. Some reviewers' comparison of the serial killer John Doe to Hannibal Lecture is ridiculous. With his unrealistic superhuman physical strength, H. Lecture's silly cartoon character looks more funny than frightening in scenes where he bites off ears and noses in a straight jacket and finds his way out from a locked iron cage. John Doe, on the other hand, is an average person who can be easily taken down in a fistfight but his psychopathic ramblings give him a much more real and menacing look.",10,1,1,19 July 2018
Unbreakable," Skinning the cat twice
","As most reviewers do I can't help but compare this movie against 6th Sense because the plot sits on the same framework with the same director, the same lead actor, a similar setup (a grownup and a boy at the center stage), the same dispassionate and wooden acting style from B. Willis, the same slow pace, a similar mystical scenario which defies logic and a sort of unexpected twist at the end... I actually enjoyed 6th Sense. But that doesn't mean I'd like to spend my time on its derivatives. When the originality is gone a stale work remains behind.",5,1,4,10 July 2018
Argo," A solid movie
","Argo is the best Affleck movie that I have seen so far. To start with, the story is so solid that the production doesn't need any embellishment for further dramatization. The script is very well written and acting is good. The scenes are very realistic although the shots seem to be taken in Turkey rather than Iran. This becomes especially obvious with women on streets without a headcover and more so with female airport agents in knee high skirts. In 80's Iran after revolution, it was impossible for women to dress like that, regardless of their nationality. It's amazing Affleck missed this important detail during the shots. Besides that, the editing and directing are in general above average keeping the tension up throughout the movie. Although the movie was criticized for slighting Canada's role in the operation the historical references are generally accurate and realistic. Recommended.",9,1,2,28 December 2012
Knives Out," An entertaining and hilarious story
","Mystery crime has long been a neglected genre in the movie industry with cheap and boring TV flicks like Murder She Baked, etc. With its star-studded cast and intelligent plot, Knives Out is certainly a refreshing and hopefully a revitalizing comeback. Although it feels like a modern day Agatha Christie adaptation with little new to offer, all its cinematographic qualities like acting, directing, scripting, editing are top notch. Despite the abundance of leading figures, the characters are surprisingly well developed and they are far from simplistic and single-dimensional. Take Joni, for example. When it comes to her personal interests and benefits, she sees nothing wrong with scheming a large sum of money from her father-in-law. Her political views on a polarizing subject like immigration, however, are progressive and humanitarian.
Indeed, the subject of immigration is the permeating subtle theme of the movie although the main plot revolves around a crime puzzle. The protagonist is a daughter of an illegal immigrant family from Latin america. She works as a caregiver to a bunch of wealthy white people none of whom has no real accomplishments but lives a posh life by simply leeching off of the rich patriarch. Most of their qualities are pretentious and skin-deep. Even the impressive 'ancestral manor' turns out to be an estate bought from a Pakistani tycoon some 40 years ago. I don't want to give away too much from the plot but the final scene metaphorically and hilariously clinches the underlying subject-matter.
All in all, Knives Out is an entertaining movie which certainly deserves seeing.",10,5,13,18 January 2020
500 Days of Summer," A fun to watch chick flick
","A romantic comedy about a metrosexual man and his sociopathic girlfriend. This is a decent work with good acting and a realistic plot which certainly respects your intelligence. The slow pace of unfolding events is typical for this kind of movies but the seemingly random selection of days and events from a series of 500 days manages to keep the audience attached. Despite its patchy stroytelling, the cohesion is not compromised. Well done...",7,0,0,1 April 2018
Hotel Rwanda," A masterpiece
","There are plenty of good reviews about this movie. It's very difficult to top them and I'll spend no effort to do so. This is about the genocide in our living memory which we indifferently watched on TV screens just like J. Phoenix put it while he was shooting a footage as a reporter in the movie. The reality of the scenes hits you so hard as to make you think you could be one of those souls stranded in the hotel if you were born under wrong circumstances. The acting, directing, story telling, everything about this movie looks impeccable. Technically, there could be some minor flaws to a trained eye, but the little cinematographic details are simply obstructed by the sheer power of the story. A movie about a million people who were butchered with machetes can't escape the violent and disturbing scenes but the blood and gore were craftily kept spare to keep the focus on human drama. Even then, you feel the violence much more powerfully than cheap Tarantino movies, in which brains and guts are lavishly splattered all over the place for redneck audience consumption. In the same vein, I can't imagine any horror flick that could instill the same kind of horror that this movie will fill you with.",10,1,1,8 May 2018
Interstellar," The most overrated movie of the year if not years to come...
","The movie starts very slowly. There's hardly anything interesting in the first hour. During that time, I almost fell asleep in the theatre. Despite the commendable efforts to make it comply with the predictions of modern physics like time dilation, twin paradox, etc. the plot is still full of gaps and utterly nonsensical actions which defy your logic. The 'scientific' references to quantum mechanics, general relativity and string theory (this one is rather implicit...) in the dialogues are very pretentious and most of the time plain silly. The only parts of the movie that would evoke interest and probably keep you awake are as usual about human drama, power struggle and emotional encounters. In this regard, all the efforts to make it compatible with the laws of modern physics become useless and a waste of time. Indeed, I have yet to see any movie that can pull it off since 'Contact.' In this regard, I'd rather see 'dumb' sci-fi movies which concentrate on drama like the first and 2nd gen Star-Trek than this sort of half-ass physics-wanna-be stuff which fail to address your imagination.On the positive side the plot is clear, unobstructed and easily understandable despite the references to theoretical physics. Compared to sheer crap like 'Cloud Atlas' that certainly deserves a praise hence my three stars for the rating.",3,5,9,25 December 2014
Now You See Me," Words wouldn't do justice for how terrible this flick is...
","I've been sort of on a movie fast quite some weeks and how unfortunate I broke it with this piece of crap. From the beginning the movie was screaming for its dismal quality with the trailer-like opening but since I rented it I decided to soldier on at the expense of 2 hours of my life. The first thing that struck me was the theatrical acting of the stars. You can probably put up with one or two and tolerate the overly pretentious acting of the minions for the magicians and the cop for a while but when heavy weights like Morgan Freeman and Michael Kane join the crowd with the same bad acting the movie becomes just unbearable. Everything about it; the french cop who fills up for the pretty brainy character, the car chase scenes, etc. so cliché, so cheesy that I can't remember a single scene which deserves a few good words to balance the score. On top of that, the never ending background music of the soundtrack is very distracting and annoying. Just when you think you deserve some peace after sitting through with this typical Hollywood trash your intelligence takes a deadly blow with the stupidest final twist which is beyond description. This is a bad, bad, bad movie you should avoid even if you're offered money to see it.",1,9,15,2 November 2013
American History X," An unimpressive family drama which fails to deliver
","This is a bland story of a white supremacist and his transformation following his jail term. Despite all the hype and awards, I fail to see anything special about the movie. At times, Derek's long boring monologues almost put me asleep. Take the scene, for example, including the jewish history teacher at family dinner table. On the surface, there's tension and drama but the whole subplot is kept so long with a stale and contrived dialogue that the tension can't be sustained and the audience is tired. Derek's transform from an effervescent skinhead to a contrite preacher also looks very cliche and cheesy. A laundry boy's unilateral clownish acts towards an obnoxious working partner eventually warms up Neo-Nazi's heart and he repents of his past. Besides that some things don't add up at all. While Derek disapproves of his neo-nazi prison gang's dealings with hispanics, he is punished by the gang because he plays basketball with black inmates. Later, when he refuses to join the gang and chooses solitude in prison, the gang which were initially brutal towards him simply let him go. The female characters of the family are poorly developed and shown weak and subdued. The mother is totally indifferent to her sons' street activities. Their room is decorated with swastika flags and all sorts of white supremacist trash, which screams trouble but all she does is to smoke and cough in her bedroom. When the younger one follows the footsteps of the older sibling in prison, she then remembers to ask for help. Why doesn't she act before? Towards the end of the movie, it turns out the racism runs deep in the family starting with the slain dad. But that thread is not followed further. Ed Norton's acting is in general good but far from Oscar worthy. All in all, this is an ordinary crime story and family drama with gazillions of clones produced as tv series or dvd bin movies.",5,2,9,16 July 2018
City of God," A splendid movie
","This is a movie about young people who live in the guts of Rio de Jeneiro. It starts with a scene where a gang of children chase a running chicken and suddenly flashbacks to 60s to set up the background for the main theme. After that, more than 90% of the movie are dedicated to laying the ground work for the opening scene, which is indeed the overture of the finale and a substantial amount of mental effort is needed to piece together the events which unfold at a very fast pace and involve a lot of characters. Despite its patchy storytelling style with full of flashbacks, the movie is coherent without any plot holes. Although a good deal of the actors are recruited amateurs from the favela the acting is pretty good and director's portrayal of the gang leader Ze Pequeno is uncompromising. The movie's fast tempo and action packed scenes doesn't leave any room for character development but this doesn't really stick out. Viewing more than once will probably be needed to grasp the whole story with its details.",9,1,1,16 April 2018
Gone Girl," Funny and entertaining
","The movie starts like your average TV mystery kind with B. Affleck's nonchalant attitude about his missing wife, which makes him a prime suspect for a possible murder. As it moves on the movie transitions into a dark comedy which is fully engaging and entertaining. To be honest, I wasn't impressed by B. Affleck's one-dimensional and uninspired acting style in his previous movies. In this one, however, I observed him breaking out from that boring style and truly earning my full respect with his outstanding performance. As for R. Pike, I have been following her since her role in Sense and Sensibility and she has never disappointed me once. In this movie, she goes one step forward and delivers a top notch performance as a sociopathic wife. I also liked the supporting cast out of which C. Coon shines. This is a well-directed, skillfully shot cinema work with probably one flaw: its length. Although you don't feel bored in its current form, the story could have been told in shorter than 2.5 hrs without losing its integrity.",9,0,1,22 May 2019
Get Out," Modern day Frankenstein
","The movie is a contemporary Frankenstein enhanced with a racial edge. It is indeed a horror movie as classified but carries none of the worn-out cliches of this genre like an eerie soundtrack, spooky settings, creepy kids, cheap jolts, paranormal events all of which test our intelligence and patience because we've seen them over and over again. Although the main idea is 200 years old, the movie doesn't dwell on it but only makes a passing reference, thus keeping its originality. All in all, this is a brilliantly made movie worth seeing.",9,1,4,31 May 2018
The Elephant Man," A touching and depressive story
","The movie tells the tragic story of Joseph (John) Merrick who lived in Victorian England. As a biopic, it is focused on the relation between Merrick and Dr. Frederic Treves who saves him from freak shows and arranges a permanent room in London hospital where Merrick spends rest of his life. Except some deviations which probably don't affect the main theme, the movie in general sticks to the historical facts. Anthony Hopkins displays a superb performance as Dr. Treves who finds himself in a moral dilemma: his humane approach to help Merrick from the cruelties of outside world is counterbalanced by his scientific curiosity which drives him to study Merrick's abnormal physical condition and exhibit him in conferences reminiscent of despicable freak shows. In comparison to the pictures of actual J. Merrick of his time, the makeup artist does a phenomenal job on John Hurt to recreate Merrick's disfigured appearance. The fact that all this happens in a pre-CGI era further adds to the value of the work. Finally, John Hurt delivers a top notch performance in a difficult acting job where he successfully plays Merrick's physical impediments along with his mental and psychological state. On the negative side, the pace of the movie is a bit slow and the narrative is quite depressing which is deliberately aided by the black and white shooting of the movie. Merrick's physical condition and the resulting mental burden on himself get us all moving but can't carry the movie for 2 hrs alone. The surrounding stories involving his abuse by his 'manager' and others, the curiosity he evokes in London high society lack in human drama and tension. The subplots of these stories are bland and too weak to pick up the crawling tempo. Finally, the movie is very categorical in displaying the attitude of people towards Merrick. Overall, we are exposed to three types of people of the time: those living underground and suffer silently due to their freakish appearance sympathize with him; the general public react very cruelly on streets and pubs towards Merrick; the concert going, educated, higher class elites on the other hand are benevolent and behave more accommodating.",7,0,0,15 July 2018
Pawn Sacrifice," Could be more interesting...
","The central theme of the movie is about the historic face-off between the two chess grandmasters of early seventies. The first forty minutes or so stand as a background with a fast-forward narration from Fischer's childhood through his adulthood as a prodigy. The second half is dedicated to the famous Reykjavik chess match with Spassky. Before seeing the movie, I quickly went through the wikipedia article about Bobby Fisher and honestly, found it more interesting than the film itself. Bobby Fisher certainly had an interesting life with ups and downs from his birth to his death and it would be impossible to capture all the important milestones of his life in 115 min. So, the film correctly focused on the culmination of his professional career in 1972. However, despite all the embellished drama over the match, the depiction of the events with a style reminiscent of Rocky Balbao series seems too familiar. Besides that, the hiccupy flow of the movie fails to keep the audience attached. Tobey's acting was good but his potrayal of Fischer as a sociopath went a bit overboard.",6,1,2,3 April 2018
Hidden Figures," Wonderful story
","This is an inspirational story told with a very good directing style and superb acting. The key elements of the era including civil right movements, space race between two nuclear powers and struggle of women disadvantaged twice; first by the color of their skin then their gender in a male dominated profession are told in a balanced way.From other reviewers' comments, I understand there are some twists to the historical facts. It is not difficult to see some scenes are overly dramatized and exaggerated. But that's what separates a drama from documentary and those deviations from the facts hardly change the above mentioned key elements. No matter how big or trivial the contribution of these women to the space program, science or engineering actually were, this is definitely a success story which needs to be remembered as a part of the black history as well as women's ascendance in social and professional ranks. Well done...",9,0,4,26 December 2018
Donnie Brasco," A mobster classic of all times
","This is an exceptionally good thriller on organized crime because it is based on a true story and actual Pistone acted as an advisor in the production. That leaves virtually zero plot hole in the whole movie which makes the events and characters very realistic, which is further helped by the superb performance by Pacino and Depp. The cast, directing, story telling, acting, character development, pretty much everything about this movie is of top notch, hence 10/10 without any reservation.",10,0,0,17 May 2018
The Piano," Average movie with a good cast
","This is a movie about a million year old story in a 19th century New Zealand setting. The plot which is predictable and dull, progresses with a very slow pace and nothing really interesting happens. The dialogs are scarce... well, for the obvious reason. On the positive side, the cast is strong and acting is good. The annoyingly indirect narrative is one of an artsy crowd pleaser with full of symbolism, which pretentiously attempts to cover plot holes of the story turning around 3 unlikable characters and a kid who merely acts as a messenger. In all this travesty, Maori folks are used as a room decoration. Harvey Keitel strikes again baring his butts and genitals for no apparent purpose. This whole mess is certainly a good consumption material for the artsy fartsy crowd who'd go rapturous to tell how much handy-dandy this flick is and decipher its subliminal messages. In reality, it is downright a borefest, although a certain quality cannot be denied owing to the nice scenery.",5,0,2,14 May 2018
Cold War," Indistinguishable footprints on a well-trodden path
","Cold War is about an incredulous love story between a Polish peasant girl and a talented musician in 1950's communist Europe. The uninspiring and dull story spreads over 15 years with Poland in the background stage. This is a theme which has been told countless times in the movie history. While J. Kulig displays some decent acting, T. Kot looks bored, aloof and nowhere near the passionate lover he's cast for. The black and white cinematography only makes the movie too artsy putting the style over substance. The story telling is choppy, jumpy and documentary style which fails to engage the audience. A lot of interesting details are glossed over and happen off the screen. Although the story involves stages in Paris, Berlin and Yugoslavia, the pace is slow and sleepy. The nomination for the best foreign movie Oscar is a big exaggeration for this snoozefest.",4,2,4,24 February 2019
War of the Worlds," A Bastardized Version of H.G. Wells Classic
","This is not a sci-fi thriller. This is not even a bad story. This is a muddled mashup of disjointed series of events involving mindless action, mayhem, explosions, running with no apparent purpose. In other words, a typical Spielberg horse-manure. It is true that if an alien force struck the earth, confusion, chaos and disorder would prevail but that that doesn't mean that its story must be scattered all over the place. The chaotic narrative leaves the impression that the aliens rather hit the movie set. The movie has no plot, no acting, no dialogue, no character development and offers nothing to engage the viewer. When you don't feel connected to the main characters you also become indifferent to their ordeal and struggle for survival. The suspense and tension that a thriller is supposed to build hangs in the vacuum. The movie starts with no promises and delivers nothing in the end, which makes it consistent at least in one thing. After seeing his prominent movies, this one erased all the doubts in my mind that Spielberg can't tell a coherent story.",1,1,1,31 July 2018
Inception," A true classic of its genre
","The major problem with sci-fi movies, especially with space and alien themed ones is that they're laden with so many logic defying crapshoot that it's difficult to sit through them with an adult brain. This is one of the reasons why I disliked and rated Interstellar poorly. Where Interstellar fails, however, Inception excels as a stark contrast to Nolan's latter project. The only nonsense you need to swallow is that people can communicate and collaborate in their dreams. Indeed, there are so many crackpots who claim more outrageous things than dream collaboration that this plot may even sound plausible to some. Once you can see beyond it you discover a very well-crafted story which runs multiple layers deep and keeps you wondering what comes next. Despite its seeming complexity, sophistication and interwoven structure, the plot is not that difficult to follow. The directing, acting and editing are all top-notch quality. The cast is a collection of stars all of whom live up to their fame. There are certainly some plotholes but the quality of the story-telling makes you see past them. The only weakness is the cheesy action scenes where the good guys always come out unscathed from bullet sprays. However, this is a psychological thriller not an action flick, hence it could be easily forgiven.",9,0,1,3 February 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," No spoiler for sure...
","But not much of an informed opinion either. I'll be honest. I fell asleep on the couch sofa 20 min after the opening and don't know whether it was due to the slow tempo of the movie or fatigue. I occasionally woke here and there but could only watch the last half an hour so wide awake. And the only reason for 5/10 rating is for the sake of fairness. During my conscious state, I saw nothing more interesting than hallucinations of an aging actor who remained behind his time. If I felt like I lost two hours of my life to the extrapolation of the finale, I'm pretty sure I'd feel more frustrated and act less generous with my rating.",5,0,0,9 April 2018
Signs," A slow paced thriller
","The movie is about a reverend who loses his faith following the death of his wife in a car accident. All the actions happening in the foreground, i.e. aliens invading the earth, the family's fight against the invaders in their farm house, etc. are indeed a ruse that serve to mask the main theme which is about the reverend regaining his faith. Although the plot involving the depiction of the alien invasion and its aftermath is sketchy and plain silly, the movie gets away with it because the action is pushed to background at the end. The cast and acting are pretty good. The pace is somewhat slow at the beginning but the film gains tempo towards the finale. Its theme is certainly deeper than a pure thriller but its handling of the action falls short of satisfying the fans of that genre. On the other hand, the plot holes in the foreground events weaken the drama and leave unsatisfied those who'd like to see beyond the action, too.",6,1,2,7 July 2018
Identity," A top notch psycho-thriller
","This is a film in which two seemingly unrelated stories run parallel. In one, we see an eleventh hour hearing where a psychiatrist tries to convince a judge to rescind a death penalty prior to the execution of a murderer. In the other, there are 11 people stranded in a highway motel in a stormy night and each one gets killed one after another in a mysterious and gory way. Considering the second story belongs to a very formulaic thriller which has been staged time and again, it would be naive to think that it makes up the core of the plot as the movie meanders along. There are enough number of twists and turns that will make your head spin. However, at the end you come to realize those twists are the essential elements of the plot and are not overly used as some viewers complain. There's also a very fine line between the annoying 'everything was a dream' trick and psychoanalysis inside the murderer's mind. This causes polarized intelligent reviews that sway between love and hate. If you can see past 'the dream' ploy you'll appreciate Identity as a well scripted, well directed and well acted movie which deserves the generally high marks it earns from the reviewers' ratings.",9,0,0,6 August 2018
Cloud Atlas," A 3 hour long trailer...
","The title says it all. As a viewer who didn't read the book the movie was an utterly nonsensical, unrelated chain of events pieced together in a total lack of coherency. The sad thing was after three hours of patience and expectations that this horrid parade of unrelated fragments (by the way, most of them are quite cheesy and cliché) would somehow connect the result was a ludicrous campfire scene on a distant planet where 'old' Tom Hanks with an awful makeup was pointing out a blue planet -yes 'a planet' among a star cluster- in the middle of milky way, in order to show where he'd come from... Speaking of the makeup, the work on 'old' Hugh Grant's face was so amateurish that the poor guy had difficulty in moving his lips when talking.Quite frankly, I've been always leery about sci-fi movies and this one was no exception. However, after seeing the cast, I was a bit optimistic that Tom Hanks, Halley Berry and other big shots would be careful about their reputation before undertaking any risk with their careers. I still think they are. It is quite possible that after reading the book (I'm giving them at least this much credit despite this shipwreck), they mentally connected all the gaps in the scenario with dotted lines and were duped into thinking that this was going to be a good movie. However, for someone who has no idea about the book the gaps are simply too large to bridge.Despite the seemingly complex plot and background, I don't think that overall job in this movie was as difficult as C. Nolan's Inception. The latter did a wonderful job by tying all the loose ends very cleverly. The producers in this movie apparently thought that casting the same actors in different roles (with bad makeups) was enough to connect the events. In the end, however they failed miserably in narrating a coherent story.",1,20,45,31 October 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A sorry parody of Bond movies spiced up with senseless mayhem
","Kingsman is a mishmash of 007 (of the cheesy type with P. Brosnan or R. Moore starring), inspector gadget and any of Tarantino's mindless gore-fests. Its target audience is pre-teen white boys. It's not a movie that a normal adult -including those action lovers- can sit through its entire length. Indeed, I was doing something else while watching it with the corner of my eye. Once, my job was finished after 2 hours of TV time -including commercials, I tuned the channel somewhere else, so I don't know how the story ended nor do I care.A lot of reviewers complain about the violence. It's true that the movie is loaded with senseless blood and gore however, its presentation is so puerile that you can't really take it seriously. Take the 10 min long carnage in the church scene, for example. Everything looks so comically surreal and artificial, that it makes you shake your head instead of cringing and looking away. I don't know why Colin Firth, S. Jackson and M. Cain star in this travesty. One would think actors of their stature would be more selective with the quality of the movies they act in, no matter how much they are compensated for. On the other hand, the two lead characters are so lame and fluffy that no amount of heavy weight actor can put the story on its feet.",1,1,7,23 January 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Humorous and Fun to Watch
","As most negative reviews put it, Fury Road is a fast-paced action movie which stands on a thin plot with a lot of cliches and not too much care about character development. But those are the tenets of any action movie, anyhow. Not taking itself too seriously, Fury Road is humorous in the sense of Schwarzenegger's Terminator movies. As a person who can hardly sit through any action movie, I found this one fun to watch.",6,2,2,18 February 2018
The Fighter," Uninteresting story of a Champion
","The Fighter seems more about Dicky and his antics rather than his brother Micky, the Champion. The band of idiots surrounding Micky, including his mother, Dicky and several sisters are uninteresting, unlovable and not even funny characters. In the absence of a serious plot, we're left to watch the unintelligent, unrefined, boring life of these dysfunctional people all of whom act like in a Jerry Springer show. After about 2 hrs, the movie ends with the usual climax of a sports flick and everything is forgotten.",4,0,0,8 June 2018
