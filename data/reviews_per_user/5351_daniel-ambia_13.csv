Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as 1
","Before my friends and I went to see vol 2 I had not yet seen vol.1. They sat me down hours before and made me watch the first film before right away going to see the second. I am not the biggest Tarantino fan but I must say I was impressed. The violence was awesome and it reminded me of an old kung fu movie with Uma Thurman. Like most of his work vols 1 and 2 were unoriginal. Compilations of older films Tarantino rented when he worked at a movie store. Except at least vol. 1 had beautiful action. Vol 2. was a waste of time. If 1 was a high budget kung fu movie 2 was a low budget western complete with slow dialogue and the insertion of long long hesitations. I did not like this movie. It appealed to pimple faced, twenty-something year old film students across the world who could dissect it and analyze in their film studies 101 and talk about how great it was. But to an average joe like me I though it was bad. It was boring and anti-climactic. I like solid movies, I love to kill a mocking bird and cinema paradiso, I don't just like violence. But if vol.2 was supposed to be more dramatic it should have had more substance. And vol 2 lacked substance.",3,3,7,23 January 2007
Match Point," Great Suspense
","At first I was bored with this film. It reminded me of the talented mister ripley. Chris is an ex tennis pro who gets a job as an instructor at an upper class country club. There he befriends Tom who introduces him to his sister Chloe as well as his fianc√©e Nola. Chris and Chloe begin a relationship, all the while Chris has his eyes on Nola. Chris finally gets Nola to sleep with him and then she disappears after her and Tom split up. Chris goes on with his life, entering high society by marrying Chloe and working for his father in law. Nola reappears and Chris begins an affair with her promising that he will leave his wife. This goes on for a while and then the movie made a fantastic turn which is the reason I gave it seven out of ten stars. For the last hour or so of the film I was on the edge of my seat, biting my nails having absolutely no idea what to expect next. I would not say it is the most original movie I have ever seen but it is certainly very entertaining and suspenseful. Before I got married I found myself in similar situations wherein I was involved with two women trying to keep one from the other. These always end bad and it always blows up in your face which is one of the reasons why its better to leave someone then to have an affair. For Chris on the other hand, things work out a little differently. For what it's worth I liked this movie.",7,3,3,10 February 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," A Fabulous Ending
","Little Miss Sunshine is the story of a family setting out on a road trip in order to enter the youngest member Olive in a beauty pageant known as Little Miss Sunshine. Although initially the trip was supposed to be taken by the mother and the daughter alone, a suicidal uncle, heroin addicted grandfather, nihilistic teenager and father with a successful facade end up coming along for the ride. For the most part the film is uneventful and, aside from Mr. Carell's sarcasm towards Mr. Kinnear, not very comical. Alan Arkin's talent was wasted during this film. His character was dry and inappropriate. Steve Carell did a decent job of playing someone who is suicidal but the script failed to allow him to shine aside from one scene with him and Paul Dano alone discussing life and Proust I believe? Well anyway The movie dragged on and I was bored until the end when the daughter finally makes it to the stage and puts on a wonderful show for the shocked and appalled onlookers. Anyway, the final ten minutes are great and made me laugh and clap and cry and all that good stuff. But to watch an entire movie for the final ten minutes. Not worth it. I give it a five out of ten for effort.",5,3,9,17 January 2007
Jarhead," Great War movie
","Although the boot camp scenes appear to be derived from Full Metal Jacket, the lingo is authentic. If you remember Mr. Emery was in the Marines so he wasn't making that stuff up. As for the war, that was the most realistic part. Because of the troop buildup and technical support, Desert Storm was the face of modern war. (The quagmire in Iraq today caused by Bush is not in my opinion a good example of modern warfare.) Anyway the story follows a young sniper through training and deployment to Saudi Arabia where he finds himself waiting for months guarding oil fields in the Saudi desert. When the battle call is given, led by his Staff Sergeant ( Jamie Foxx in top form) the sniper begins the long trek toward the heart of Kuwait and the enemy. Unfortunately the war takes off without the infantry leaving them in the dust of the armored divisions and the air force. By the time the Marines enter the kill zone the war is all but over. This is an excellent film but if you are expecting a war film with blood and guts this is not the movie for you. This is a movie for marines and soldiers who understand the loneliness of deployment and the relentlessness of constant repetitive military training that you know you may never have to use in the first place. It is a story of the human struggle to overcome personal hardships. I love this movie.",9,2,3,23 January 2007
Gandhi," Couldn't they have found an Indian actor
","The story of Mohandas Ghandi is one that needed to be told through film perhaps several years earlier during the height of the civil rights movement when it could have helped enlighten more people. The cameo by a young Daniel Day Lewis is priceless. Two generations of academy award winners meet on a dusty street set in south Africa. I gave this movie an eight out of ten because it is truly an impressive piece of work. But a part of me is puzzled. Kevin Costner found authentic native Americans when he filmed dances with wolves. Mel Gibson managed to scrounge up the finest in Scottish talent for Braveheart. Why couldn't they find the perfect Indian to play Ghandi, perhaps the most influential Hindu in history? There are thousands of Indian actors the cast directors could have picked from and most Indians, due to years of colonization, speak English better then most Americans. Don't get me wrong, Sir Ben Kingsley is a fine actor and deserved the awards he received for the role. I am simply speculating when I wonder why they picked a British man whose ancestors probably helped invade and exploit India instead of an authentic Indian. That's all.",8,2,16,23 January 2007
Saw III," This movie is terrible
","I liked the original Saw. It was suspenseful and it was inventive and the ending was done in good taste. Saw III is not a good movie mainly because of Jigsaw and his accomplice. Visually it is disgusting and it made me cringe several times because of the gore and I suppose the makeup artists did a good job. But the plot and the lines that jigsaw says ruin the film. His character is extremely flawed. Nothing actually explains his insanity, something about a car crash or something, boo hoo. The actor did not do a good job and the actress who portrays his accomplice is equally obnoxious. The original saw portrayed Jigsaw as a silent killer, which worked. From Saw II until this one they have him as an actual character which I believe was a mistake. He's boring and fails miserably at attempting to play a psychopath. Doesn't even come close to Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs or even Kevin Spacey in Seven. Please don't make anymore of these movies. And if more are made please do not give jigsaw any lines because no matter what he says there is no explanation through words for his insanity.",3,6,10,19 February 2007
Saving Private Ryan," no no no no no
","I give this movie a four out of ten because the cinematography was good. Other then that it was crap. The acting is terrible especially by Vin Diesel, how the heck did he get that role anyway? The plot was ridiculous and boring, the script was very poorly written and over all I am disappointed in both Tom Hanks and Mr. Spielberg. Now I know Spielberg loves to make movies about that era, of course he was too young for that war and too old for the next one, but hey, he's richer then god, he can exploit anything he wants. The movie follows soldiers in the 75th ranger regiment as they land on the beaches of Normandy. (best scene in the movie). Tom Hanks is then given an assignment to rescue Matt Damon and bring him home because all of his other brothers were killed in combat. So almost every man from Hanks' squad dies but eventually Ryan gets saved. The Germans, of course are all incredibly unnattractive brutish men. In reality the war was fought by a bunch of twenty-somethings on all sides who had no idea what they were getting into. But the Hanks-Spielberg team completely redeemed themselves with band of brothers. So do yourself a favor, skip renting this, pay a couple bucks more and pick up all ten episodes of B of B. It's a true story based on real heroes of WWII, and the acting is not bad. Thats all. Save your money if you want to see saving private ryan, wait for it to come on ABC.",4,19,41,5 February 2007
Reservoir Dogs," Why does everyone like this movie?
",A group of men meet in a diner. They are each assigned names after different colors. Then as a team they set off to rob a jewelry store? The robbery goes bad and what ensues is a bloodbath as the police and the robbers face off with each other. This is not a good movie. I love all the actors but I don't think this movie is well written or directed. If you're going to make a movie about gangsters one should do more research then Mr. Tarantino did. He stayed home for a few years watching old cowboy movies and came up with this garbage. I love Pulp Fiction but this film is so horribly conceived its impossible to take seriously. I don't understand Americans. I don't understand why people like this movie. It is so completely unbelievable. I would have rather watched a movie about a child stealing gum from a grocery store.,2,8,19,23 January 2007
The Departed," Not as Good as they Say
","This is not a bad movie. Like all other Scorsese films it is okay. The plot establishes a good cop, bad cop scenario on the streets of Boston. One is a dirty cop, the other is undercover in a crime organization led by Jack. Funny I've never heard of the Irish mafia. Jack Nicholson is the same character he always is in most of his movies except in this one he drops his r's like a good Masshole. It was fast paced and I did enjoy the violence and suspense. And I had a feeling that a lot of people were going to die throughout (hence the title). Anyway, It's been ten years since Titanic and Leo does not look like he has aged a month. It's been eleven years since the Basketball Diaries and Mark Wahlberg looks old enough to play DiCaprio's father. Anyway do not go into this expecting a whole lot of depth. Scorcese has never been able to pull off a movie where the viewer is completely surprised by the outcome. I must say Alec Baldwin is hilarious, Marky Mark is cool, and Martin Sheen is getting old, damn. And the one black guy is not in it very much, reminiscent of Samuel L. Jacksons brief brief appearance in Goodfellas. Anyway go see it, have fun, root for the good guys to come out on top, and ask yourself, why does the academy always nominate the same people year after year? And know that Scorcese will win best director not because he deserves it but because the academy feels bad for him in his later years. Smiley face smiley face, goodnight.",6,0,1,5 February 2007
The Green Mile," Thomas Newman does it again
","I must say the first time I saw this film I was not impressed. I was 15 and with my parents in the theater. I watched it again today with my wife because it came on FX and I was too lazy to get up and change the channel. All I have to say is what a movie. The story is about a gang of prison guards who work on death row in a prison down south, They do the best they can to make the condemned mens lives a little bit better for their final days. That is if the convict is not a complete animal without remorse. Enter Mr. Duncan playing a dimwitted muscular African American accused of murdering and raping two little girls. At first I thought maybe this character is slightly offensive? But his lovable nature and antique soul helped me see beyond that. He is truly a beautiful man, an angel perhaps who has the ability to heal the sick. As the film goes on you learn that he was actually trying to heal the little girls. Anyway let's just say a black man in the south in the nineteen thirties did not stand much a chance of being found innocent of anything even if he was Jesus Christ himself reborn. I shed tears on several occasions to the point where my pregnant, over emotional wife was comforting me. I do give this film my seal of approval for what its worth.",8,0,1,31 January 2007
Platoon," A classic film?
","Willem Dafoe is outstanding in this film as he usually is in most of the work he has done. Forrest Whittaker, Kevin Dillon and Johnny Depp are enjoyable to watch as well simply because they are so darn young. I have read about the war in Vietnam extensively and according to friends of mine who served in that war Platoon gives the best depiction of the environment, uniforms, customs etc... of the time. Unfortunately, although Stone had a lot of the right ingredients to make a war film classic including funding and personal experience, he fell short in my opinion due to the final scenes of the film. As he so often does, Oliver Stone touched on a serious issue but did not have the guts to delve into it as he did in Born on the Fourth of July. The scenes reminiscent to the public of the My Lai massacre are sugar coated. Sheens character somehow turns from being a sniveling preppie private into a VC killing Captain America by the end of the movie. While I'm sure there have been cases of extreme heroism such as that,I felt the way the character metamorphed into a larger then life hollywoodesque Rambo was extremely unbelievable. It took away from the momentum of the film. It probably would have been better to kill off Sheen because in reality that is what would have happened. Anyway, I respect Stone for his politics and for well, some of his films anyway Alexander and Any Given Sunday excluded, but if only he had stuck to his guts and made a war movie with a little more realism then Platoon would most certainly be a great war film classic.",6,1,4,17 January 2007
The Deer Hunter," This movie sucks
","First of all, The Deer Hunter is boring. In the tradition of the Godfather there is a forty-five minute long wedding scene in the beginning where we learn absolutely nothing about the title characters except for that they are Eastern European, that they all like to get drunk and that three of them are joining the army even though all of them look well above maximum enlistment age. Then they go hunting and you learn that, okay they are all hunters. Next, with absolutely no back story, Michael (Deniro) is in the middle of a Vietnamese village when he reunites with his two friends from home. Then all of a sudden they are all in what looks like a POW camp where they play Russian roullete with the guards. Due to limited dialogue and even more limited plot structure most of this film makes absolutely no sense. Although the actors gave critically acclaimed performances, none has the opportunity to shine in my opinion. Also the director obviously had no military advisors on set because he would have known not to put in several details, (fellow soldiers could point them out immediately). Overall I was disappointed because the cast is very promising and even the concept is kind of intriguing, but the movie is just a mess and too poorly edited for a plot to be deriven from it at any point. This should not be called a war film just a boring ass movie wherein Christopher Walken looks really young, that's all. Oh and Meryl Streep looks pretty hot.",3,14,27,3 March 2007
Munich," I don't get it
","I did not like this movie because of content. The acting was good and the script was believable but the subject matter was very disconcerting. What happened to the Israeli Olympians in Munich is not depicted all at once but is broken up into several different flashbacks throughout the film. Each one gets more intense until the end when all the athletes were killed and the terrorists along with them. The audience is supposed to feel so bad for these twelve men when a character in the film casually mentions that over 200 Palestinians were killed in retaliation. But that's not enough. Now an elite hit squad must be assembled in order to make every mastermind behind the operation pay with their lives. And of course the hit men make sure they don't kill any children, they just create an orphan. No I found this movie extremely biased and inappropriate considering the happenings of the world today. Its not okay for a nation that is not sanctioned by the UN to enflict vigilante justice on people who could very well be innocent. It's not okay for two hundred people to die and then the movie goer is supposed to feel bad because 12 Israelis died. How come Spielberg did not show the charred bodies of the civilians lying on the ground after they were bombed indiscriminantely by Israeli tanks. I just think he should have depicted both sides a little better instead of brushing by it in order to appease the liberals. Well I hate liberals but I'm sure they are appeased.",4,0,4,5 February 2007
