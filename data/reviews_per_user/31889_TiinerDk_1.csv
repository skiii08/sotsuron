Howl's Moving Castle," good!
","Ever since I was small, this was my favorite movie, I thought it was really good. It must just be seen. It's a really cute movie, with some good characters, and one falls in love with a lot of history. It can be hot highly advised, also for children. I will probably never get tired of seeing it. For it is really cute. If in has not seen it yet, I thought of to do it. It's the same with all the other movies from the same author, for they are so cute, and has a really good way to describe the world on. The one may seem a bit tedious at first, but it goes quickly, without saying too much. I hope you enjoy your time with this film.",10,0,1,2 February 2015
