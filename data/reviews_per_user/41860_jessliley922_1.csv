It," worst movie ever
",The graphic suck the monster were not scary. shoot the original it movie was way better then this one and the graphics wasn't all that great but it worked all the same. i love Stephen King but this movie dose not do his book justice i'm hoping the 2nd one is a lot better then this one. this is the worst movie i ever seen.,1,1,5,2 January 2020
