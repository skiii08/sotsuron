Black Swan," Fight Club for girls...
","Great film. Top notch. Aronofsky is feeling his groove. This movie is dramatic, somewhat intense, visually stunning, and just silly enough to make it a modern American masterpiece. I call it Fight Club for Girls because I feel that if an alien culture were to invade and watch it and Fight Club they will learn A LOT about men & women. I love what Aronovsky does with feet. Movement in this film in general is enchanting. The visuals are so so sweet. & I respect the story - how well the feminine side of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as both dramatic hallucinations & cold hard reality in the fantasy & fact that spill out of the soul of this woman & put on display in a wonderful dance juxtaposed against the stereotypical nature of the characters who surround her. One of the finest roles ever for a woman in American cinema, & its Natalie Portman's finest performance since The Professional.",10,1,2,1 September 2011
