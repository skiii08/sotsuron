Blade Runner 2049," A Sci-fi blockbuster epic with a smart plot but not so smart themes
","It is rare to find a sequel that outshines the original in almost every way, and BR 2049 should be applauded for just achieving that feat. This is a visually stunning, narratively complex sequel which unfortunately inherits all the thematic weaknesses of the original and so falls a bit short in achieving the ultimate purpose of creating a SF movie, but still needs to be applauded for its ambition.First the good bits : the set designs are unbelievably good and detailed, and it is clear that a lot of effort went in this imagining this future world in a logical and coherent fashion. The narrative is tight and complex and requires some attention on the part of the viewer to connect the dots. Some of the plot details are kept a little fuzzy, maybe intentionally, but it is still leaps and bounds better the original Blade Runner.The core theme of BR has always been about asking what makes us humans, especially relevant in the future where we would have very smart and capable entities who can do things exactly (and sometimes much better) than humans, but they do not have the basic human rights. However, the replicants have exactly the same biological structure as humans, in other words, they are humans both from the inside and outside, but still they are not somehow regarded as humans? This theme is much better explored if the entities are actually mechanically produced (such as androids) and have clear differences in their internal structure from humans. This would starkly differentiate them from humans, but still raise the thorny question of consciousness due to their abilities and intelligence. In BR, it is really hard for me to swallow that replicants are somehow not considered humans.",8,0,5,4 February 2018
Brokeback Mountain," A tragic and melancholic, but beautiful and tender forbidden romance
","In many ways, this is a very typical love story : a forbidden romance, bowing down to the rules and needs of the society, the resulting sorrow, ruining more lives in the process with betrayal, a desperate attempt to cling to traces of the romance, just leading to more heartbreak and an unfulfilling life. As can be inferred from the summary, this is a sad movie, but it is also beautifully shot, full of scenes with natural beauty and soothing calm, interspersed with moments of passion which nonetheless mellow out with gentle love and tender care as time passes and the characters grow older. What truly shines though is the brilliant acting performances, especially by Heath Ledger who truly sells a very conflicted and broken soul, torn between love, duty and fear.",8,2,3,19 November 2017
Pan's Labyrinth," Emotionally powerful and melancholic adult fairytale
","This film has a bit of everything : fantastical creatures, horror and tension, historical slice- of-life (dealing with the aftermath of the Spanish Civil war in 1944), a fairy-tale like story competing for screen time with a grim military attack against rebellious guerillas, loathsome and sadistic characters, but also cute and inherently good characters, warm and fuzzy sequences full of love and emotion, but also extremely brutal and disturbing violence. But most importantly, this film has a lot of heart, and by the end you will feel intimately connected with its principal characters, and it will make you cry with its stirring and somewhat ambiguous climax. This has been called an adult fairytale and there is a lot of ambiguity as to whether the magical and fantastical sequences are real or the imaginations of a scared and lonely child. There are clues towards both these possibilities, but I personally believe that thematically, it makes more sense that the fantasy sequences are just created by the mind of our child protagonist to cope with all the strangeness and brutality around her, and the ending really hits you even more powerfully with this assumption, as we grasp the true purpose of these imaginings and see how it helps her to achieve peace and happiness in a really grim situation.",8,1,1,14 October 2017
Split," Superb Acting by James McAvoy, but don't hold your breath for the twist
","The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy the amazing performance by James McAvoy, who is able to effectively and very convincingly portray wildly different characters almost effortlessly with minimal change in physical appearance and entirely through superb acting. One scene in particular has him cycling through three completely different personalities of his character at the drop of a hat, which is quite remarkable. The twist at the end is so disappointing that it is almost non-existent, those who have not watched the movie Unbreakable won't even understand the twist. At least this movie will keep you entertained and is not as atrociously paced as most of M. Night Shymalan's movies.",7,31,50,24 September 2017
Gandhi," The story of a great man, the birth of a nation
","'Gandhi' is a comprehensive biographical sketch of one of the greatest men of contemporary times, and certainly the greatest man in the history of India. It also dutifully covers almost all the major events of India's independence struggle from the rule of the British Empire. In spite of being an historical account, the movie is by no means dry or pedantic, and it covers a large span of years with perfect pacing, often being witty, moving, humorous, thought-provoking and sprinkled with large doses of Gandhiji's famous messages.It is ironic that a Britisher would create such a moving and heartfelt portrayal, and it does hurt the credibility of the movie that every one is speaking in perfect English (even Gandhiji's famous last words are in English). Having said that, the movie is completely successful in exploring the life and character of Gandhiji, and in providing a faithful overview of the difficulties involved in the birth of India.India's independence struggle was unique, and Gandhiji's idea of non-violent non co-operation and shaming the Britishers by attacking their good image and appealing to their sense of morality and honour was a master stroke. As a person, all of Gandhiji's admirable qualities are on full display here : he was a man of strong conviction, an iron will, a sharp intellect and complete dedication to the cause of a strong, independent India.To be honest, the events portrayed in the movie are so far in the past that it is easy to debate about the importance of Gandhiji's non-violent movement in hindsight : India would probably have gained its independence sooner or later since the Britishers had suffered massive losses in the Second World War, but without Gandhiji, it is hard to guess whether would it have been more violent or less violent, and what values and principles we Indians as a nation would have inherited. It is also debatable how much of those values and principles that Gandhiji so strongly advocated have survived in the present time. All that said, it is certainly beyond debate that MK Gandhi was a great man, and his philosophy and his pivotal role in the birth of India will always be remembered.",9,1,1,14 April 2018
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Slow, very realistic, almost documentary-style adaptation with brilliant acting and music
","This is a slow, beautifully acted western which is a very realistic and faithful adaptation of an actual historical event. To be honest, it is a bit difficult to relate to the principal characters and the themes are very specific to the era which are not much applicable today. Glorification of criminals (especially charismatic gun- slinging cowboys) is not something that is relevant today, and the movie only touches on this theme towards the very end.The movie is beautifully shot, the background music is stirring and perfectly matches the events, the ensemble cast is brilliant and both Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck give good performances. Brad Pitt generally only plays one type of character-the charismatic, confident, commanding leader-and Jesse James perfectly matches that archetype, although I think that Pitt's efforts to show how broken Jesse is inside do not quite hit the mark and are not very effective. Further, every other character is terrified of Jesse but we do not actually see him doing much, which is slightly puzzling. Casey Affleck is also good, but the jump from Robert Ford adoring Jesse James to Robert Ford suddenly deciding to assassinate Jesse at any cost is a bit abrupt and not very convincing. The assassination scene itself is very strange, in fact Jesse's entire behavior leading to the assassination scene is very puzzling, almost as if he had already given up on his life which does not quite match his character. Motivations are not effectively conveyed, and one has to carefully consider the events to infer them. But perhaps that is intentional, as the focus of the movie seems to be just relate the facts and events in an almost documentary-style. The movie is really long and depicts in great detail a number of extraneous events involving other members of the James gang which are only tangentially related to the central narrative. In spite of all the complaints though, I was utterly captivated throughout its entire length, and the acting and music and the gravitas of the characters makes up for all the other shortcomings.",7,0,0,24 September 2017
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Dr - A brilliant construction of an intangible reality
","This is the kind of movie that gets better on every rewatch. The first time I watched this movie, I was left cold and puzzled, as almost the first three quarters of the movie just consists of weird sequences, all mesmerizing to watch and brilliantly created, but with little logic or plot, with the mood crazily jumping from pure horror to comedy to everything in between. To first-time watchers, I advise patience, as there is a method to the madness, and the last half-hour of the movie provides an answer to almost all the strangeness that went before it. (I should also point out that this is unlike most of David Lynch's other creative endeavours, which can be maddeningly surreal and logically unfulfilling). On a rewatch though, one would be able to fully appreciate the brilliance of all the strangeness in the first three-quarters of the movie. There is a very strong rationale behind the weird sequences, as Lynch is committed to the construction of an intangible, irrational reality which nevertheless is intimately familiar to all of us, and which has its own set of rules governing its shape. Every little detail in this intangible reality has a specific meaning, and the way all this ties to the overall plot of the movie is nothing short of mind-blowing. Lynch's script and direction is as usual, mesmerizing and entertaining, Naomi Watts gives an absolute masterclass in acting (in particular, the audition scene is probably the best acted scene that I have ever watched), Laura Harring is stunningly beautiful, and the background score is haunting and stirring and perfectly captures the mood of the movie. The story is ultimately a tragedy, and a cautionary message about the price that we pay for having dreams and then seeing them shattered.",9,3,4,8 December 2017
The Imitation Game," A truthful glimpse into the unique life of Alan Turing
","The Imitation Game is a honest and truthful glimpse (or at least as truthful as a Hollywood movie can be) on the life and works of Alan Turing, one of the founders of modern Computer Science as we know it. Now to be sure, the greatest work that Turing did was formulating the theory of Turing machines and decidability, but since that work is not really exciting or dramatic enough, the movie focuses on his work on breaking the cryptographic Enigma code used by the Axis in the Second world war. Now I was slightly disappointed during the first half of the movie, focusing on the usual melodrama involving unsocial and mis-understood geniuses, love interests, 'traumatic' childhood memories, uncooperative bureaucracy, unknown spies and double agents, etc., but Turing lived a unique and singular life, and the second half exemplifies this. As Turing understood so well, while breaking the Enigma code was a challenge, the even harder problem was what to do after it was broken, and how to use all the un-encrypted information strategically so that the Axis would remain blissfully ignorant of their vulnerability. The movie unfortunately does not dwell much on this exciting storyline, which could have provided a much more interesting and unique look at what was going on behind the scenes in the Second world war. The final years of Turing's life were a tragedy, and fortunately, the movie does not shy away from these ugly details. We can only wonder at what discoveries Turing could have made if he had been allowed to work with freedom and support. But, be that as it may, Turing's legacy will continue to live on in the future, and for us mortals, the immortality of their works and ideas, their name is the greatest achievement that we can hope for.",8,0,0,21 October 2017
The Dark Knight," A Masterclass in plotting and character growth
","There are some things which always stun me on every rewatch of this masterclass : the plot complexity, the themes, and the unique philosophies of almost every major character which compels them to battle against each other, which in turn changes and transforms these characters as they struggle to pick up the pieces of their pride from the resulting chaos. To have some amazingly choreographed and really long and complex action sequences, and most importantly to have them not just for the sake of action and spectacle (not that this would be a bad thing), but use them to fuel character growth and show a clash of philosophies, a clash of egos is an amazing achievement.This is one of those movies (Nolan's The Prestige is another example) where the underlying script is just so strong that other things such as the performance of the actors, the cinematography, the music, etc. do not really matter much. I do believe that Heath Ledger gave a really good performance as the Joker, but I also believe that the character itself was written in such a brilliant way that any competent actor would have done it justice. A mild criticism of the plot is the numerous coincidences and the hellishly complex schemes of the various characters being executed perfectly on every occasion, but the Joker remarks in the movie that he has no plan and he wildly improvises according to the situation. The Batman and the Joker almost perfectly anticipate each other's moves on every occasion, and this leads to a deadly and complex dance between the two which is mesmerizing to watch.I will just say that this is pretty much the absolute pinnacle of super-hero movies, and I am pretty sure that we will never get another super-hero movie anywhere near as good as this one (especially considering the formulaic and childishly plotted super-hero movies being made nowadays).",9,0,0,14 October 2017
The Fly," A very good body-horror movie
","The Fly rests its excellence on two pillars : a great performance by Jeff Goldblum and stunning visual effects. The plot is a fairly straight-forward one of a scientific experiment gone terribly wrong, with a very slow reveal of the horrifying consequences. There is very quick ramp-up of the disturbing factor though, so much so that I was almost ready to close my eyes before the very disturbing final scene. While the plot is a bit clichéd, the characters have very distinct personalities and are far from clichéd. All the three main actors give very good performances, aided by a clever script, but Jeff Goldblum's performance is particularly noteworthy as the eccentric scientist. It is notable that during his character's slow transformation into the fly, we see glimpses of fly-like behavior when he is still a normal human being, and then glimpses of the eccentric scientist even when he turns into a full-fledged monster. The special effects are very good (and gory), and there are some horrifying scenes which appear very realistic.",7,0,0,12 October 2017
Mother!," The mother of all allegories goes slightly overboard, still creative and thought-provoking
","One does not need any deep knowledge of Christian theology to see through the painfully obvious allegory of 'mother!'. As an allegory, it takes itself too seriously, so that every almost every action in the movie feels unnatural, and is not supposed to be taken on face-value but rather as a part of its metaphorical argument. This makes the movie highly creative and thought-provoking, but leaves no room for any realistic character development or plot. All the principal characters are also metaphors for specific qualities, so while their behaviors can seem one-note and jarring, they make perfect sense once you realize the underlying intent. As with any Aronofsky movie, this is not a cosy or comfort watch, and while there is an ominous undertone almost from the beginning, the movie explodes into a orgy of violence and destruction towards the end, albeit again with an allegorical intent.",7,0,1,20 December 2017
