Skyfall," Disappointed
","I'm really glad I got the chance to watch the movie for free at a pre- screening, otherwise I would have felt ripped off.I've always liked the James Bond franchise, every film this far has been enjoyable to watch. The Skyfall story lacked two of James Bonds signature ingredients: An eccentric/mad arch nemesis and gadgets.The second half of the movie felt like a TV-pilot to get to know the characters in preparations for the next episodes.Skayfall came up short on the grandeur.Both Bourne legacy and Taken 2 has been better on the screens this year even though they were more predictable than Skyfall.",4,23,59,25 October 2012
