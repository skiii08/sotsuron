United 93," The anti-Pearl Harbor
","Finally, a movie which doesn't load itself up with predictable melodramas and attempt to force an emotional reaction out of its audience. United 93 simply told the story as accurately as possible and let the viewers reach their own conclusions. Greengrass (writer/director) realizes that when making a movie about 9/11, it isn't necessary to evoke a reaction, instead he simply lets the events speak for themselves.The movie is done so beautifully simple. We know nothing about the characters except for what we learn about them from their actions on that day. There aren't any typical heroes like you would expect to find in the latest Michael Bay trash. Greengrass simply gives us everyday people in extraordinary situations.As hard as it may be for some to see this movie, I would recommend it to everyone as it is easily the most important movie made yet this year (that last sentence may lose credibility since there haven't been many other important movies this year).",9,14,31,29 April 2006
Silent Hill," An atmospheric but empty movie
","Finally a video game adaptation which doesn't completely leave me covered in the movie executives feces. This movie is easily one of the most atmospheric movies made in recent years. The sets all prepare the mood excellently and the tension builds even though nothing in the way of plot ever really happens.That brings me to my main complaint, the movie is essentially about nothing. Which, unlike Seinfeld, doesn't work. The plot is nothing more than an attachment to give reasons behind the various monsters which appear (which are actually done quite well). But in terms of plot and character development, it feels like I am looking at amateur work that someone could make a Lego movie out of.I would not suggest this movie for anyone except fans of the game and genre buffs.",4,0,3,22 April 2006
