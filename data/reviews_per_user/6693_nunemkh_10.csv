The Ring," Brilliant and shocking!
","THE RING is my favorite horror movie of all time for many reasons. It is a remake of an excellent Japanese horror film named RINGU. I love both films and own both DVDs. Now since there are so many reasons why I love THE RING, I'll organize all the things I love and the very few things I would change about this brilliant and creepy film. But first let me give you a short version of the plot: after the death of her niece, investigative journalist, Rachael Keller finds a strange tape that her niece apparently watched one week before her death. The rumor behind the tape is that if you watch it, you will die seven days later.THE INTRO: The introduction to this film is very smart. At first it seems like a cheesy teenage slasher flick. But that my friends is a trick. After about 3 minuets into the film you realize just how mature and suspenseful of a film this really is.THE CHARACTERS: The characters of THE RING are great. Rachael Keller is the perfect journalist. She's very inquisitive and smart; she certainly does allot in this movie and keeps the plot going. Also Rachael Keller is a great mother; she puts her own life in danger so she may save her son. Noah Clay is sort of a comic relief, he's sarcastic and stubborn but is also very smart. Noah helps Rachael solve the mystery of the cursed tape. Aidan Keller is the son or Rachael Keller, Aidan is quiet and wise beyond his years, he was very close with his cousin before she died a mysterious and horrible death. The character list goes on so I'll skip ahead to the villain. Samara Morgan is the antagonist in this film, and boy what a villain. The secret to Samara's past is a sad and brutal one, which would explain the things she does through out the film.THE STYLE OF HORROR: I love horror films like THE RING. THE RING is very unique in it's style, it is filmed like an Asian horror film; full of flash backs, creepy imagery, nightmares, mysteries, and hallucinations. It's very bizarre and surreal at times, which isn't very out of place since this is a supernatural horror/thriller. If you ask anyone who has scene THE RING 'which scene do you remember the most?' they'll probably tell you 'the closet scene!'. This is referring to the 2 seconds of footage of Katie, dead in the closet. This scene is the biggest jump scene in the film. There are a lot of different types of scares in this film; jump scares, suspense, shocks, chills, and intense terror! WHAT I WOULD CHANGE: There is very little I would actually change about this brilliant horror film. In fact, there is only one scene, the climax. I guess I would like one that's a bit longer. The climax in this film is still satisfying but I definitely wouldn't mind a longer one.THE ATMOSPHERE: Atmosphere is something I highly prize in any film, but especially in horror films. It's industrial in some places and fantasy-like in others but it's always tinted green or blue. It's almost always raining and the settings are all very nice. The settings go from Seattle to the forests of Washington to a fictional island and beyond.In conclusion I would like to once again say that this is my personal favorite horror film of all time. I highly recommend this movie to any one with intelligence and an imagination. THE RING is an amazing horror movie, a cult favorite now and a cult classic in the future, a blockbuster, and so much more. The critics loved it and so will you, trust me.",10,2,2,16 October 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," An amazing fantasy cult favorite and an instant classic.
","THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe, is my number one favorite fantasy film.This is because it has all the right ingredients. The score, the acting, the story, the imagery, its all incredibly well done. And because it's the first in the series, and director, Andrew Adamson's first live-action film I could excuse the minor flaws.The plot is interesting enough to capture the audience's attention and the pace is done well enough so that the audience stays with it. The film is about the Pevensie children who are sent to live in a house in the English country side while their father is fighting in the war. Their mother stays behind but they cannot because of the bombing raids that have been occurring: the introduction where we actually see a bombing raid is quit exiting. And so while the children are entertaining them selves in the mansion by playing hide and seek, the youngest, Lucy, finds a large wardrobe to hide in. the wardrobe that Lucy hides in turns out to not have an end in fact it leads to a parallel universe. And so we enter Narnia. A few other events take place and soon enough all four children are in Narnia and cannot leave. It's not because the portal disappeared, but rather they feel morally obligated to stay and fix the problems they have created and to fulfill a prophesy. But this prophesy turns out to be delayed a bit when Edmund, my favorite character, betrays his siblings and all Narnia by siding with a tyrant known as the white witch.NARNIA is a great film because even though it is one out of a million other fantasies aimed at kids, it stands out because it has such a whimsical quality to it. The colors, the lighting, the characters, it all adds up to a magical mix of atmosphere.The score is perfect. The songs played during the battle sequence is beautifully moving. As well as the music during a citrine scene which I cant say too much about since it would be a major spoiler.The mythology in NARNIA is also enjoying to watch. It seems like a mix of Greek, Roman and western European mythology. I must say every shot that includes a Griffin is marvelous. This mythology of creatures also insures some key characters being animals. And some of my favorites include two talking beavers who happen to be marries. Also the character of Mr. Tumnus is a very nice one who seems to contribute to the plot greatly although not too many people noticed that.I would have mentioned Aslan in the previous paragraph since he is also a talking animal, but because he is the god of Narnia and an amazing character that has gone down in fantasy history, he deserves a paragraph for himself, although maybe only a book would be able to do him justice. Aslan is the god of Narnia and like the god that religious people believe in on earth, he is completely mysterious. Its not always clear why he does or doesn't do the things he does or doesn't do, but it does always seem to work in the end. Aslan, along with all the other Narnian creatures, is created amazingly by the film makers. There are so many incredible shots of him. He is also voices perfectly by Liam Neeson.I think what makes me respect this film so much is the fact that there was so much love that went into making this film. And of course that is a very important ingredient in film making.So I would definitely recommend this film to everyone, watch it, and buy the DVD. I got the 4-disc edition and its great, if you're a fan you should buy nothing less than the 4-dosc set. It includes more special features than the 1 and 2-disc editions plus it has a feature-length documentary on C.S. Luis, the author of the beloved NARNIA book series.",10,1,2,26 August 2007
Juno," So far the most realistic teen comedy i've ever seen, and the best.
","It really was the best, it was an awesome movie! The fact that some people didn't like it is just a coincidence. Juno is an up-lifting and hilarious movie. I left the theater feeling better than I have in a long time. The acting is surprisingly great. And the music is so wacky and fit for the movie - I listen to it every day now! I loved the cinematography also, since Juno gets pregnant and 9 months is long enough to go through all 4 seasons, i feel the director of photography really captured the seasons and colors very well. And another thing. I think every good movie needs a lovable character, and every single character in this movie is incredibly lovable! This movie is a great addition to the sub genre of teen comedies and actually is like no other teen comedy you've ever seen. Go out and watch Juno, then buy it! I know i will. Oh i couldn't Wright a review on Juno and mention my favorite quote from the movie- 'that ain't no etch-and-sketch, this is one doodle that can't be un-did home skillet'",10,1,5,8 March 2008
Silent Hill," mixed feelings....( minor spoilers)
","When I first saw the trailer for silent hill, I thought it would be great! Now i don't know what to think.THE GOOD: I liked how silent hill was more than just a horror, it was a fantasy too. It had some of the best imagery I've ever seen in a horror film - the gray children scene -. This may sound weird but i loved the names of the characters for some reason, I guess cause they weren't your every day names. I loved the atmosphere of the movie, something about it just made me think Jappanese horror meets french drama with a little bit of 1990's look - don't ask why. Also I loved that the horror part of silent hill was meant to look like a night mare because t sure was bazaar enough to be a nightmare. Also the costumes were great. THE BAD: A bit too confusing at the end, could've been just a little more explanatory. The characters sometimes make god-awful decisions. Some of the dialog is very silly like when Cybil the cop sees an armless faceless creature walking towards her she yells'stay were you are!' for a second there i thought she would give him ankle cuffs and ask him for his license. For a movie that has a lot of creatures in it's first 2-3 quarters it sure didn't have any in the horrific climax, I think some bazaar looking creatures would've gone great with the barb-wire. and finally what bothered me was the last shot of the movie, plants, honestly they couldn't come up with a better, more relevant last shot than some plants in-front of roses house?So anyway silent hill is a very entertaining horror film although it does disappoint a little.",6,0,0,21 January 2008
The Village," Aazing, i more than loved it...
","When i first saw 'the village' i was blown away. It was so beautiful and compelling. The music is so beautiful and will give you goosebumps. the atmosphere is very enjoyable and so are the sets and locations. The acting will put you right there in the character's position. And the message will tell you something about our selves.I also loved the use of master shots- meaning long takes that show how the actors have learned there lines and can deliver them professionally without having to cut repeatedly.Now on to the scary part, it is after all a horror/thriller. the scars were intense and effective. The Sheeree terror of the characters were so amazing and made me feel a great sympathy for them. You will leave this movie feeling like you've never seen any thing so beautiful and effective in a scary movie before, because the truth is, you haven't.",10,2,2,26 August 2007
Disturbia," a bit too teen-age-ish for my taste...
","Disturbia is not a bad movie at all, its just a little too teen-age-ish. And if you ask me it was not very original. The biggest rip off hear was of course 'REAR WINDOW' it also took some plot points from 'WHEN A STRANGER CALLS'-which if you ask me is a lot better than this film- and also 'SAW'. But other than that it was very enjoyable and fun. There was plenty of suspense and frightening moments. Humor was also added into the mix which is very nice except the comic relief, Shia's best friend Ronny is a bit annoying at times. The acting was good and the song choices were nice too- loved 'LONLY DAY' by System of a down. So folks if you want a good movie with not a lot of adult actors but a whole lot of suspense go out and rent 'DISTURBIA'.",9,0,0,11 October 2007
Across the Universe," best musical ever!
","Just saw Across the universe at the theaters and it rocked! Way better than Tommy or any other acclaimed musical. The songs were amazing! Mostly Beatles but there might have some other origins to the songs. And even though the adaptation's weren't exactly like the original songs they were still great. The acting was very convincing and effective. And the surreal moments were, well, SUREALE! Sometimes confusing though. For example I really didn't understand the deal with the Kayako looking girls in the middle of the lake, but oh well still a nice visual. And all the colorful tydye and volcano lamp images were pretty cool too. This is the perfect movie to watch with some friends. That way you could walk out of the theater singing and dancing in the streets like i did with mine! XD",10,1,4,7 October 2007
Shrek," ahhh, good times good times....
","For me watching shrek is like watching my past. its so fun and enjoyable. the story is nice the characters are awesome and hilarious, and the settings are beautiful. I simply love watching this movie. the voices fit the characters completely. and the music and soundtrack is so nice. donkey is so freaking hilarious! and shrek is very relate-able. No matter how many times you watch shrek, you'll never get tired of it. like i said it reminds me of my past and i hope watching shrek will give you good thoughts and feelings when you watch it, and remember to watch it with a close friend, it'll make the experience all the more enjoyable.",10,0,1,26 August 2007
300," how could a movie so stupid be so popular?
","' this is Sparta!!!!!!!!' my response:'SHUTUP!!!!!!!!!' First of all did the director think that we would want to see characters who act like they're god's gift to this world. seriously i'm not sure if Spartans were really that conceded in real life but i hate the ones in this movie... so much! let me tell you all the things that were wrong about this movie: there were no locations, only sets. the acting, if you can call it that, was horrible. the characters, annoying! the the sex scenes, not cool at all. the battle scenes, the worst part of the whole film. if i were a Persian i would be freaking mad! in this film Persians are portrayed as sissy cowards and weaklings. and smart people are all UN-manly. if there weren't so many parts were the action was slowed down the movie would only be 30 minuets long. the whole film is effects and CGI! As if there aren't good enough locations in Greece were it actually happened so that they could film it there. and i didn't even get weather it was a history or fantasy film.let me just tell you that this poor excuse for a film was nothing but trash!",1,12,24,27 August 2007
Donnie Darko," Powerful.
","The film DONNIE DARKO has got to be one the most powerful films I have even seen. Having said that, you must be wondering why I only gave it a rating of eight stars. I'll explain.When I first heard about this gem of a film, I had been informed that it was extremely depressing much like the song that appears in the ending of the film 'Mad World'. This intrigued me as I am a lover of dark depressing cinema. Although this film is dark and by the ending a bit depressing, it isn't what I would call bleak which is also what I expected it to be.The images can be very disturbing and the dialogues or rather the points and philosophies brought up in the dialog can be very interesting. However some of the dialog is one of the things that I didn't like about this film. What I am referring to is the constant vulgar cussing that goes on between siblings at the dinner table next to their parents which has become a routine scene in American films pertaining to teens. I guess because my I'm not American I can relate to those situations. I also didn't like the incredibly lenient and cowardly parents Donnie had.Since allot goes on this film it was easy for me to forget about these flaws, especially when the last fifteen minutes of the film played before my eyes and took me by surprise. The climax's mix of nostalgic, devastating, and uplifting emotions were only enhanced by 'Mad World', I must say that I first heard this song three years before seeing this film and it felt good to hear it like this.This film left me feeling strange in a way no film ever has, DONNIE DARKO is truly a film worth watching.",8,0,1,14 October 2009
