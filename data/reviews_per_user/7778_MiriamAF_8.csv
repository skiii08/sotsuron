Hereditary," Last 30 minutes of horror
","The movie is too long (2 hours) they could have made it with 90 min or less, acting is great, the last 30 minutes of horror will make up for the slow start/middle parts, the ending reason is not so great though.",7,2,6,23 August 2018
Us," Comedy not horror
",This movie should be listed under comedy category not a horror for sure. At one point I thought Madea's Tyler Perry character would appear.,3,187,281,28 June 2019
The Irishman," It's so boring
","All these raving reviews are bs, a group of big celebrities in a mafia movie with a really boring story telling, boring acting, bad makeup, no fancy wording here just to say this is a bs Scorsese movie, he trashes Marvel's movies while his is a total let down no entertainment no art.",2,15,29,30 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Great ending
","Loved the previous one more, nonetheless this was a great movie, it was wonderful to see the future meets the past. Yay for the avengers all the way",8,0,8,16 August 2019
The Favourite," Bad movie shame on the characters
","Went to watch the movie thinking i'll see something sophisticated with 3 great women actresses, instead I watched something cheesy, Hollywood lesbian story and really bad camera direction, and oh god the annoying music through the whole film. Shame on these actresses who I felt just sold themselves cheap to get it on this movie and accept such a role, especially Emma Stone, you got the Oscar you don't need to flash your boobs to the screen.",1,3,8,25 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," So great
","Loved the movie, great action and dialogue
Can't wait for the next one to see what happens!",9,0,3,26 February 2019
A Quiet Place," The movie is good if you want to ignore all the logics
","The movie is good if you want to ignore all the logics & if you want just to act dumb, first if your kid died why would you get preganant again & bring another child into a world where monsters live, and you can't control baby's crying sound. Secondly the movie in year 2020 and they know the monsters have high ability to listen so how come they never targeted their ears, thirdly if they die by gun why the heck they all don't have guns and used them from the start instead of screaming and let the monster eat them! Lots of holes in the story that offend the intelligent viewer.Never the less I had a good scare watching it lol!",7,0,2,27 June 2018
The Greatest Showman," Loved it
","The movie is so wonderful, it does make you smile. I watched it twice in a row.",10,2,5,11 April 2018
