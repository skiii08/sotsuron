E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," This film is quite brilliant!
","I don't know what age you were when you first saw E.T. I was probably about 20. My older sister had gone to see it when it came out in 1982 and had really loved it and my older brother had gone to see Tron instead. I think that I was more influenced by my brother than my sister and so I by-passed it entirely. It took me ages to even give in to curiosity and watch it one Christmas, because I thought it was going to be tedious and boring and possibly even mushy. But, I did watch it and it was quite brilliant.I saw the re-release in the cinema just recently and I actually got a shiver down my spine when I was watching it. This doesn't happen to me very often - and no it was not cold in the cinema. I really was surprised that the film was as genuine and funny and complete as it was. I was surprised that the cast was actually able to act. I was very surprised that Drew Barrymore was able to be convincing. The music score was perfect. And I say that as someone who has not received much in the way of music teaching but has watched a lot of movies with some really diabolical soundtracks. E.T.'s soundtrack fits so well with every facet of what you see and it gives a real flourish that was definately absent in Tron. I don't want to talk about Mr Speilberg, but I think he did a properly good job of this one. I think what I am trying to say is, that having finally seen this film and having had a low view of it before hand, it was great to be proved wrong. This is now one of my very favourite films, and is the second best cinema experience I have ever had. If you have never bothered to watch E.T. then go and see it NOW!I should note here at the end that my brother has still never seen it, and he probably never will - I think this is something to do with honour, or was it ego.",10,2,4,19 October 2002
