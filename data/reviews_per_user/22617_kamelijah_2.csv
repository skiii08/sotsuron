Your Name.," Best piece of art my eyes have ever witnessed
","This movie has in its depth, its details, its messages outcasted any movie I have ever watched. It's a majestic masterpiece in any aspect. Everything that happens, that's said, every motion and scene has its profound meaning and sense. It leaves your mind in questions during the movie but each one gets answered, nothing is left untouched, each apsect is worked on beautifully. My boyfriend has always hated anime series and this movie is as he says the best one he has ever seen. Yoi are going to think about it long after the last scene has left you in happy tears. Music is beautiful, landscapes gorgeus, characters deeply elaborated and detailed. Complex and beautiful.",10,3,4,31 August 2018
It," Utterly disappointing
","I felt obligated to write a review, due to not just a slight difference between the movie rating and the actual experience our whole theater room was having. It really felt like cheap and intimidatingly boring movie that can not be compared to any good horror film. Me and my group of friends were really close to actually leaving the room, there was constant laugh about the predictability and clich√© moments. The whole time was happening so much but still nothing actually happened. And I wouldn't call it scary but disgusting. There was no actual built tension but just one big WTF. The kids were fun at some moments of the movie, and the story definitely has a good ground but it was terribly adapted into the movie. I cant remember the movie thag annoyed me as at this one even though I consider myself patient and open about different kinds of movies.",1,43,90,18 September 2017
