First Man," The movie feels very authentic.
","This movie has its flaws, like a really slow first act. But the performances by its main actors plus a really amazing final act make this one of the best movies of the year.",8,1,3,15 December 2018
The Favourite," I really enjoy historically inspired movies
","Like Yorgos' other films, it's dark, disturbing and darkly hilarious. There's some outstanding performances all around here.",9,3,4,25 June 2019
Cold War," Sadly this movie didn't win any oscar.
","The conflict seen here is a metaphor for the issues that not only plagued the Warsaw pact countries, but are intrinsic in the conflict between populism and the intellectual paradigms governing the current EU. The resolution presented marks a foreboding future for the issues plaguing Europe since the end really of the First World War.",9,0,1,18 April 2019
