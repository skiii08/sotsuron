Requiem for a Dream," Pros and cons
","Pros:
Erratic camerawork, really visually interesting, capable of connecting two different actions by shooting them the same way
Every main characters was well acted, especially Sara, really easy to relate to
Immersive universe, you get to know everything the characters do for fun, how they work, how they get what they want, etc.
Visuals are inspired, dream sequences
Truest tragedy I've ever seen, so terrible to watch these well built, relatable characters just suffer horribly for a third of the movieCons:
Jared Leto's voice can be annoying
Slight overuse of main theme songBest part: Sara's monologue to Harry about being old and wanting to get on TV, an excellently acted, written and shot story of emptiness and want, most powerful scene in relation to the themes

Hereditary," Pros and cons
","Pros:
Good acting, very strong main characters
Pretty creepy, points to the soundtrack and the special effects/writing
Heavy emotional beats, pacing plays off wellCons:
Ending, while visually spectacular, is a little explanation heavy, subtlety could've been more fun
Pretty illogical that there were no attempts to seek out a mental health professional, probably because there was no time limit on the conflictBest part: the few minutes after Charlie dies, so heavy and so realistic and a great plot point
Worst part: seance with grandson Louis, kind of weird that the cult could do that even, whatever",7,0,0,5 April 2020

","Pros:
Extremely unique way of telling a story

Decent sfx sometimesCons:
Characters are all horribly cliche, female lead especially is a useless damsel in every action scene
Feels like you know exactly who's going to die
Lacks a consistent internal logic, no rulesBest part: boat on fire scene, fun shootout, clear shot, fun setpiece, overall effective action and cool to watch

Kevin Spacey's character and story were just not developed very much at all
Boring villain
So many parts just toss names at you as if you're supposed to know all these assholesBest part: Bloody Christmas, solid representation of police fraternity being used as an avenue for brutality, also good characterization for Ed Exely

Camerawork is controlled well, can heighten some scenes very well
Most spooky visuals are effective, especially the lady in the bathtubCons:
Soundtrack is grating and can be to the detriment of many scenes

The same can be said about the telepathic elementBest part: Jack getting a drink for the first time, they really let him go off and introduce us to the deranged parts of him well

Good progression into action
Great effects
The apes won in the endCons:
You have to be willing to accept some silly, unbelievable stuff to have fun
Any part with subtitles is incredibly sillyBest part: Ceasar saying no, executed well, a good moment of silence after, the start of the apes rising up

","Pros:
Fun original soundtrack
Really good special effects minus the dogs sometimes
Cool aesthetics for humans and ghosts
Ok jokes sometimesCons:
Not really funny a lot of the time

Worst part: marshmallow, very lame, anticlimactic, not a fun battle",5,1,3,24 February 2020

A lot of useless characters
Some recreations of scenes feel too over performed, doesn't capture the subtlety of the originalBest part: Tommy in the very beginning explaining why he wants his own planet, a touch heartbreaking and passionate
Worst part: laughing at stuff in the theater, most on the nose, annoying commentary",6,0,0,7 April 2020
Joker," Pros and cons
","Pros:
Original story, really powerful themes about class imbalance, mental illness, how much you can really take from someone, etc.
Crazy good acting for Arthur, every movement is planned to capture the image of someone discovering their role in the world
Character design for Joker is so good, the design of his followers works greatCons:
Love interest subplot was just bad, they totally could've told the story of Arthur trying to find warmth in the world differently
Thomas Wayne storyline left something to be desired, did not have satisfying closure
Fake tension violin sound in legitimately tense scenes were not welcomeBest part: Murray Franklin show, great dialogue and great way to solidify the transformation from Arthur to Joker

Entertaining writing, the conflict in the first half was genius, while the second half was very unique
Lots of moving parts, small stuff contributed to a larger society or culture
Themes of class, wanting and deserving were expertly communicated, characters and story did a great job relating to them
Very pretty settings, well shot throughoutCons:
Second half is not as entertaining as the first
Morse code stuff at the end is a little sillyBest part: getting rid of the old housekeeper, height of clever writing, entertaining family unit, was a great exercise in making the viewer want bad people to succeed
Worst part: the mom threatening to involve the police with the underground people, I think they were trying to say the good life corrupted her to become a piece of crap, but it seemed out of character because of how quickly she responded like that",8,1,5,8 November 2019
Carrie," Pros and cons
","Pros:
Really good at building up scenes as beautiful, warm, good, etc. and destroying that peace
Very good lead actress, great at conveying panic, hope, social anxiety
Very stylized horror scenes, ending actually made me jump
Cool take on high school, almost every character is so nasty for different reasons
Very good soundtrackCons:
Plenty of grown adults playing high schoolers
Few scenes that seemed to drag, did little to further the plot
Carrie's kind of a bitch for killing the people on her side, she could've tried harder to save the gym teacher and her prom dateBest part: first shot of the prom scene, great start in building an idyllic, warm, happy scene
Worst part: blowjob outside of the bar",8,0,0,27 January 2020

Sick character designs, literally like a dozen cool looks throughout
Can have decent scene to scene tension, actionCons:
Not clever in any way, no good writing (with the exception of one liners)
Spartans ethics are never challenged even once
Slow motion is egregious
Story is predictable, very simple
Don't care at all about any nameless Spartans, I know Leonidas will survive to the end, so the long term tension is nonexistent
Looks bad, very flat and fakeBest part: that first scene where they block attacks with the phalanx, cool stuff
Worst part: that slow motion shot of the queen walking in the courtyard, definition of frustrating",3,0,5,22 February 2020
Goodfellas," Pros and cons

Many scenes seem a little too highly detailed with no later payoff

Good set design and use of extrasCons:
Plot points being random or random for the sake of variety was unwelcome sometimes
The two crooks who weren't George Clooney didnt get a lot of good lines or scenesBest part: the adventure before meeting the wife was all fun, so the sirens or the cyclops scenes were the standout fun bits
Worst part: stopping the KKK leader through the power of music, a touch cheesy and out of character for the speakeasy politician to act a fool in public",7,0,0,21 November 2019
The Godfather," Pros and cons
