Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just let yourself go!
","'The Phantom Menace' is more like the original 'Star Wars' than I think most critics want to admit.  'Star Wars' had its share of clumsy editing, less-than-fluid acting, and irritating characters, but time and 'classic' status has allowed us to selectively filter those out.  I feel sorry for those who choose not to like this latest in the series.  The familiar universe, the fantasy/fable story line, the breathtaking action and visuals, and the portents of things to come all heavily outweigh the quirks.  You have to try hard to not like this film.  Or you've forgotten how to be a kid.  For me, it was nice to be fifteen years old again.",10,0,0,26 May 1999
