The Blair Witch Project," Excellent Movie!
","I wanted to hate this movie, due to all the hype, but this was one of the best films I have ever seen.  Is it scary?  Yes, if you are willing to play along and suspend disbelief.The moviemakers and actors are brilliant.  This movie shows that plot and acting and filming can make a movie that is a huge hit.  I have to believe that the people who don't like the movie were not paying attention to the plot - and the ending is absolutely EXCELLENT and scary as HELL!",Null,0,1,5 November 1999
The Day After Tomorrow," Brilliant! Exciting! BLOCKBUSTER BABY!
","I am stunned.  Not only is this movie visually amazing, and a lot more scientifically accurate than the rush limbaugh fans would have you believe, this is a story which grips you by the throat.  If you see one 'blockbuster' this summer, see this one!  The performances are virtually flawless, the sense of horror and astonishment are palpable, and you are drawn into the film in exactly the way the director wants you to be. 
This movie is being attacked by right wing nutjobs who think 'evolution' is junk science, and that women shouldn't be entitled to vote.  Do NOT listen to the them - the film is AWESOME!!!  Highly recommended that you see this one on opening weekend, to share the sense of wonder with the rest of the audience.I predict this film will gross 200 million in the US.",Null,0,0,25 May 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Absolutely Brilliant!
","This film was brilliant from frame one.  The camera work, the dialog, the plot, the acting - pure, 100% entertainment.  Easily one of the best ten films of all time - I wish Ritchie would make a sequel.  If you haven't seen it, see it.  If you have seen it, buy in on DVD and treasure it for the work of pure genius that it is.Movies like this make cinema important - the only people who don't like this are the freaks that think Moulin Rouge is brilliant because of the pretty colors.",Null,0,0,18 October 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Brilliant
","Don't listen to the countless lamers who said Reloaded sucked.  'Reloaded' was excellent from start to finish.  This movie will win numerous Oscars for technical achievement, but should also be nominated for writing and directing.  10 out of 10 stars for Reloaded.",Null,0,0,19 May 2003
Gladiator," AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!
","Gladiator is a truly awesome movie.  This is better than Braveheart (and Braveheart was a '10').  Crowe is absolutely convincing as Maximus, and the supporting cast are uniformly excellent.  The opening battle scene is worth ten times the price of admission.GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!  You will not be disappointed - Gladiator is THE movie to see in 2000.  A truly wonderful epic, and accomplishes all its goals, and then some.",Null,0,0,19 May 2000
