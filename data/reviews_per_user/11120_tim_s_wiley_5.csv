Vertigo," I don't watch many Classics - but WOW! Freaking WOW!!!
","I can't even imagine how good this film must have been received in the late 50's when it was released... It is freaking amazing... It is hard to believe a former real-life Brigadier General Jimmy Stewart is such an amazing actor...This movie has crazy suspense, tension, mystery tied with romance. I have been trying lately as i got older to go back and watch some of those 'Must Sees' and this has blown me away along with Rear Window which was an awesome move also featuring Jimmy Stewart. I'll be honest typically have a hard time with classic movie believability... but absolutely not the case here...This particular Hitchcock film is brilliant... the film can go any number of directions at any time and keeps you wondering/guessing... I dare not mention anything about the plot because its best discovered during viewing.",9,2,4,7 April 2013
North by Northwest," Perhaps Great for its Time - But Acting Not Convincing
","Well i always try to check movies off my 'Must See Before Dying' list and so i turned this one on. The movie has a great premise and story... my only problem was Cary Grant.I thought he was great on the train scenes with the girl... but as far as the drunk scene, and a normal person who's life is in jeopardy multiple times he just didn't seem real to me... like he didn't take any of it seriously. Just not convincing for a good part of the movie.I think this movie would have been great even now had there been someone more convincing in that role someone who was really concerned with living/dying rather than a regular citizen trying to portray a 007 veteran coolness.Again the part on the train (witty exchanges with the woman) were great and you could really pick up on the innuendo of the times.",6,4,9,30 March 2013
The Bourne Legacy," I really wanted it to work but sadly it did not
","I REALLY wanted this to work because this one of my top 5 film series of all time and i have been a HUGE fan since the beginning... Sadly ... VERY SADLY it didn't come close and it hurts. Lets face it the other films were AWESOME!!! and this change-up without authentic author written material just had 'FAIL' written all over it from the onset and Damon knew it. Truth be told if they just introduced this film as a new film un- associated with the Bourne trilogy it would be an OK film, but don't pit a Yugo against three finely tuned Ferrari's. It didn't fool anyone.The core problem is it is this film fails miserably while pretending to replicate the same balance, pace and intensity of the three predecessors. Its just not there... you want it to be and you can feel the film trying but its nothing more than lipstick on a pig and you can feel it midway through the movie.The earlier films were in your face gritty and this one was Hollywood diet-grit due to a weak script and too many other minor deviations from the original formula. In addition to the weak and a repetitively themed script, liberties with other low-key casting choices from other films just gave this boat another anchor. Why add Norton and Weiss? Like Bourne himself the earlier casting choices minus Julia Stiles were somewhat off the grid choices. Weiss just didn't fit at all... and Norton has been amazing in other movies but i will take a Conklin, Abbott or Landy any day of the week over his re-hash character.The cinematography also felt noticeably more Hollywood than Bourne style unfortunately or else i was already clouded with disappointment and anger.The good is that Renner did not try to become Bourne in the movie, he was his own character and i liked what he brought, but even his madd skills couldn't get this thing close to the same league as the other films.I've always envied Matt Damon's decision making when it comes to choosing movie scripts. Initially i really really wanted him to stay with the series no matter what, but after seeing this one now, he once again made the right call by staying on the side line. Verdict: Renner big thumbs up but sadly this film had big shoes to fill and never got its feet in.If you can't do it well why do it all???",5,5,13,12 August 2012
Rear Window," Not a Classic Frequentor - But This was Awesome and Relative
","Well i took a risk... after watching Cary Grant be not so believable in North by Northwest i was thinking this classic thing isn't for me... than i gave Rear Window a watch on a whim and it was awesome... Jimmy Stewart (A Former Real-Life Brigadier General) was amazing... it was funny... it was extremely relate-able and current as far as relationships go btw men and women and it had the great touches of Hitchcock suspense going on, and Grace Kelly was outstanding and unbelievably beautiful...Definitely a fantastic movie... my 2nd favorite of Hitchcock's right next to Vertigo which is amazing as well.It is absolutely amazing how great these movies are without all the crazy effects and technology we rely on today for movies... You can take Hitchcock's films and go a zillion different ways almost anywhere in the movie.",9,0,1,7 April 2013
The Great Gatsby," No Shame its Perfect!!! No Spoilers!
","This movie feeds the soul in countless ways. It is a humble yet visionistic peek into our hopes and dreams as human beings.The story epitomizes the American dream to have struggled, worked, earned, and to eventually deserve.It communicates a life in which against all adversity we refuse to let go of optimism and core beliefs. A life in which we blaze a path decorated with kindness and dignity making painful sacrifices only when absolutely necessary to embolden our cause.I can watch this movie anytime. It literally is a timeless story outstandingly portrayed with incredible acting, lavish visuals, and heavenly surrounding sound. This film along with a couple choice drinks can have a re-invigorating effect on the soul.",10,0,3,28 February 2014
