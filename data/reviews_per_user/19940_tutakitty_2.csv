Black Swan," Disgusting
","If you wanna see a movie full of disgusting lesbians then be my guest. Some how the movie crossed to a lesbian love story in the middle of it. It was disgusting, i threw up in my mouth and walked out of the theater. Absolutely the worst movie with Natalie Portman ever. It went from being a thriller, to a 'love story'. It's pretty much a little porno. I hope i never see a movie like this again. I wish the movie info would tell you there will be homosexual relationships in the film. Hollywood should inform people what it is the movie so it does not offend. We say if there is killing, why can't they say there is homosexuality? I was not happy with this movie, and it should NOT receive any honors or awards.",1,5,17,5 February 2011
Burn After Reading," All Star Cast with a terrible, terrible story
","How can a movie blow with both George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it? By making a story line that has no purpose or true comedic relief. The only reason this review gives the movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because actors in it. How exactly is there humor in a story line that is not clearly defined and can't be followed? From the beginning to the end the movie is entirely too choppy.We open up with a CIA analyst who gets demoted for being an 'alcoholic'. He Analyst gets highly upset, storms out of the office and quits and decides to write a book about everything he learned in the CIA. Meanwhile there is no proof in the movie that the guy is an alcoholic. Anyways goes on with wife is cheating on him with George Clooney, who is like a nympho and goes on dating sites and has sex with random women everyday, (like does this character have a job?). Anyways you find out later his wife is cheating on his as well and everyone is in a weird sex ring at this point right? Anyways both dudes get served divorced papers one at the beginning (Analyst) and one at the end (Clooney). The movie 'plot' is that two bozos who work at a gym (Brad Pitt and an Older Lady) team up when they find a CD from the Analysts wife's attorney's secretary (see you already see how bogus this is) with information on it the Analyst's wife was using as leverage to take all her money's before she filed for divorce. It not only contained part's of the Analyst's book but also financial information from her husband where she could go in and take money from his accounts. The two gym bimbos try to get money from the Analysts using the disc as hostage saying they are 'Good Samaritans' and deserve a reward if he wants his disc back. 
Of course at this point the Analyst blows a gaskit and doesn't agree to terms and demands his information back. The older woman gym bimbo wants the disc for plastic surgery money and Brad Pitt... well we don't know what he wants the plastic surgery money for or why he is even hanging out with the annoying older lady to begin with. It all spirals out of control to where eventually Brad Pitt gets shot by George Clooney, the Gym Bimbos boss get's shot by the Analyst and then the Analyst gets shot by a random dude in the street. The CIA is monitoring the whole situation, doesn't care about anybody dying just cares about their information on the disc. So in the end they agree to give the crazy older lady gym bimbo her money for her plastic surgeries to keep quiet. 
HOW MORE ANNOYING, STUPID, AND UNWITTY COULD THIS MOVIE BE?
Literally a waste of an all star cast. I want to erase this movie from my brain because that's how terrible it is.",2,1,3,21 January 2018
