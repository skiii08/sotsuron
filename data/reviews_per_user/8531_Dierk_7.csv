Alien 3," Much better than critics have said
","One of the good things about the Alien saga is that every instance in the series has its own vision. The first one was a class 1 gothic horror movie, the second showed us a war in space. The fourth one gave us a satirical comedy with splatter elements. And the third? Well, it is not that easy to categorize as it shows much more of a personal vision than a genre.Alien 3 seems to me the psychological society play. Fincher is more interested in the drama of the small group of people than in the action sequences. This led some critics to write that the final chase is poorly staged. Seeing it now -- some 8 years after its initial release -- the scene is not bad but was just unusally filmed. What wonder since Fincher is one of the new breed of directors, trying to invent new perspectives. Like the one of the Alien with its distorting big 'head eye'.Funny enough, if you watch Aliens and Alien 3 directly after another, the non-professional fighters in the Alien 3 behave more professional than most of the professionally trained Marines in Aliens. Yes, there are some whining scenes but when it comes to fight the inmates in Alien 3 do their duty. which cannot be said of the Marines who take much longer to even try to save their lives. and even than it's just some of them (and there are not many who survive the first Alien attack) who seem to remember what they are there for.The overall look of Alien 3 is great and shows us how to tend a Future vision without loosing grip on reality.",8,0,3,28 May 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Underappreciated
","This movie may not be what hard core SF fans or critics wanted to see in the Alien series. But nevertheless it is a very good film.Jeunet -- and the producers in choosing him as a director -- found the funny elements in the Alien saga and made a mostly bizarre sci-fi comedy. Well, it is not the kind of comedy Chevy Chase may stand for. It is a distinctly European kind of humour in the mold of Monty Python.It would be a mistake to give anything away concerning scenes but be aware of some really, really good laughs that will stuck in your throat. Jeunets satire reminds one of the pictures of Hieronymus Bosch, either you like it or not. Oh, and be aware that Jeunet does not need as much 'shock' scenes like previous directors but uses much more graphic violence and splatter effects.Another thing: With all its gross humour the film delivers some of the most endearing and emotional scenes ever in a sci-fi flic.",8,5,12,28 May 2000
Armageddon," Sheer unadulterated fun
","Ok, the plot is not very logical most of the time, the characters are not really developed (well, both artistically and the persons in the movie). But it is fun to watch, it looks good, it sounds terrific it uses its fabulous cast brilliantly especially Bruce Willis who underplays -- coming up with a very funny parody of himself.As said above, the movie is sheer unadulterated fun without any message apart from 'Do your job, do it good and you'll be brave!'",8,1,1,23 January 2000
Face_Off," Very big disappointment
","Ok, I really wanted to see this movie since nearly everybody seemed to like it. I really hoped that the film was not just hyped -- and was disappointed. The story is convoluted with way too many ideas, most of which would make excellent movies for themselves. But as it stays *Face/Off* just became an overlong explosion much like *The Rock*. The script has lots of logical errors, like a governmental agency lead by an emotionally involved man. Really, Sean Archer would only do some archival work, if anything, after losing his son through a sniper. And what about his marriage? I cannot understand (in any movie), how a stressed marriage is rescued just by some shoot outs? And why is it just a handful of bullets that can make 'wild' teenager into good suburban citizens? And why does nobody wonder how (the wrong) Archer could possibly deactivate the big bomb in just one minute when all the experts could not do it in hours?And what of Cage and Travolta -- well, I haven't seen this much hamming (especially on Travolta's side) since ... William Shatner after 1962.To be fair, some scenes of the movie are quite good, like most of the first twenty minutes, the prison sequence and Cage (as Archer) with the criminal friends after his escape from Erehwon.If you want to see a good action movie (or any kind of good film) this is not the one to go for.",3,2,5,22 April 2000
Back to the Future Part III," Definitely much underrated
","This movie has been underrated from its release to this day. Even the producers and director underrate it.If you see the film out of context of the other two you will watch a nice and well-done Western parody, which on the one hand tries to mock typical cliches and on the other hand conveys something about real life on the Frontier. Isn't it quite funny how the 'educated' Marty McFly falls for every cliche he has seen on TV? Even the gunmen (Tannen and his gang), who themselves try hard to *be* the feared Jesse James' of their valley, are baffled by Marty's view on the West.Almost everything that connects this part to the other two is nothing more than icing on the cake, knitting together some loose ends (i.e. Marty's inability to play the guitar). It doesn't add anything to the characters or plot or story. Nonetheless these in-jokes are brilliantly executed, coming nice and easy, not with big fanfare.I really recommend this film - although, let it be noted that it is not the brilliant and innovative movie that *Back to the Future * is. Or s dark a satire as the second part; it's just plain old fun with real characters.",8,1,1,14 September 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," One of the great romantic comedies -- not just of the 80ies
","A really funny film: very good actors, brilliant ensemble work. The dialogue is good (even if not as funny as that of *Philadelphia Story* or *Four Weddings and a Funeral*). All comparisons to Woody Allen's films are deadly wrong; *When Harry...* is FUNNY and not all self-indulgent. Highly recommended for everyone, especially when you have anything to do with a relationship either working or broken, new or old, well, whatever.",8,1,1,21 February 2000
Munich," Asking questions rather than giving a simple answer
","*Munich* is a complex movie, reminding us that film makers and artists have to rather ask complex questions instead of giving simple answers. It is much more than just a plot about the Israel-Palestinian conflict.The movie is as much about war and what it does to people, about the difference in old-school wars against big numbers of enemies you can hardly discern when shooting and the modern war on small bands of terrorists you have to look in the eye, the beginnings of modern terrorism and the current state of it.It's main theme is the problem that just causes may lead to terrible consequences taking one to the same moral level than one's enemy. Spielberg pictures life as it is: a continuum, not a series of distinct moments. You can suddenly find yourself on the wrong side without being able to point down to the one moment you went wrong.Even after having watched the whole movie the viewer is unable to tell if or when the moral predicament gets awry. And that although the script gives us two Killings (and a 'collateral damage') which are not on the original agenda.Some critics take exception to the way the Israeli athletes in Munich are depicted as cardboard characters. But then, most of what happens in the Olympic village and on Munich's airfield is only shown in retrospect by Eric Bana's character, the leader of the Israeli killing team, who hasn't been in Munich. He envisions what we see and ultimately - in the world of the movie - don't know!Not much of the original attack is shown from an outside, objective perspective: We see two US athletes helping the Palestinian terrorists into the village, how they get around in the deserted floors and how they enter the athletes rooms. There's also some glimpses of the media hype surrounding - and eventually sabotaging one attempt to free the hostages - the whole affair. Everything else is only Avner's imaginations.",9,0,0,2 February 2006
