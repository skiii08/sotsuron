National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Book of Mediocrity
","I have not seen the first film in this series so I am unable to comment on how well this film holds up against it, but I have to assume it was mildly successful to warrant a sequel, however for the life of me I can not see why. It is not that this is a bad movie it is just that it is completely mediocre in every aspect and completely devoid of inspiration, this truly is just a poor man's Indiana Jones. Nicholas Cage plays the lead character Ben Gates a treasure hunter like his father before him who becomes involves in a fight to clear his families name names from being involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Unsurprisingly this ends up in Ben and his ensemble (ex wife Abigal Chase and erstwhile colleague Riley Poole) on a globe trotting mission to reveal the secrets in all sorts of historical artefacts and locations that will lead to the truth and clear the family. The problems for me where that I just did not care about any of the cast. Nic Cage was really just acting by numbers and the film managed to waste the joint talents of John Voight, Ed Harris and Helen Mirren which in it's self in my opinion is the film's greatest achievement. The direction is run of the mill and a little research on the director Jon Turtletuab led me to unsurprisingly find that his previous television and film work had also been mediocre. Not one for me and not worth a second viewing.",5,2,4,4 May 2008
Vertigo," a stunning success
","This is a stunning film that really is the product of a master craftsman. Some people complain it is slow but really it is not it is just we are now used to being fed movie of a faster pace full of fast cuts. But what we have here is a fantastic study of Hitchcock's of obsession and misogyny. Where all the characters are given room to breath. It is not good to give away too much of the plot or that can relatively spoil the movie on a first viewing. The film is basically the study of one man John 'Scottie' Ferguson's obsession with one woman. The surrounding plot is really secondary to that (Hitchock's famous McGuffin). James Stewart is on magnificent form here (there really is no modern actor who could play his everyman role so well). The way each and every shot is shaped and crafted here is truly great, and we also get something which you rarely see in films these days, scenes with no little to no dialogue where the image tells the story, and here this is used superbly. From the fantastic Saul Bass opening credits through to the final shot everything here is right. The only week point being Kim Novak who I do not think is that great an actor, but apart from that the only other part of any other size is Barbara Del Geddes who is very good as Madge. We have some almost psychedelic effects shots from Hitchock to add to the deepening sense of paranoia that culminates in a great suspenseful finale. Superb to be enjoyed time and time again.",10,8,11,14 July 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk is a smash
","OK fight fans here we go. First let me get started by declaring I am the only person I know who actually liked the Ang Lee Hulk movie. So for me this is not an essential remake. I thought that movie had a magnificent sense of pathos. But here we go the great things with modern super hero movies is just like the comics we can re-imagine them as and when the film makers see fit, and in this case it has been done well. Marvel is on a bit or a role here as they have now surpassed my expectation with both this movie and 'Iron Man' This movie seems to cleverly run on from Lee's version whilst giving you an altered history in the opening credits. We have Bruce Banner now holed up in Brazil a fugitive trying to understand his so called disease. Whilst General Ross is desperately searching for him to cultivate his research into a weapon. Where this film differs from the first is that it is action pretty much all the way and very well done it is too. Hulk seems a little smaller and therefore more accessible but the CG is good and the rainy sequence trick is used once again to help the blending in of scenes. Also where this film will work for the fan boys is in the appearance of a proper comic book villain in Abomination. Abomination's back story is handled well and Tim Roth gives a good hammy performance to match the stellar efforts from the rest of the cast. (I have heard Edward Norton is unhappy with the cinema cut and would like to see the cut he preferred, and would really hope he makes himself available for any potential sequels). There was some good homage's to the past with a TC clip of Bill Bixby, a cameo by Ferringo and the inevitable Stan Lee cameo and a real plus for me they even worked in a little bit of the old TV theme tune. A real unexpected treat.",8,2,3,1 July 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Run of the Kung-Fu Mill
","Well here we go with another CG animated movie full of cutesy animals. Will it be any good or will it be simply average like so many of its competitors (only Pixar produce consistent gems). Well I went in to this movie with high hopes having read a positive review in 'Empire' and the fact that I was viewing the movie in IMAX would surely help. Well unfortunately not. This is just an average movie where everything is well done but no connection was made with the characters on my behalf. Admittedly most of the children in the audience seemed to enjoy the film (but I felt even they would of enjoyed it more). The animation is strong though I found the fight scenes a bit like watching a computer game. But I just was not taken with any of the characters and the main character of the Panda just did not do it for me, there was just too much Jack Black here and not enough character. The films ends with an inevitable conclusion and although by no means a bad movie it would take a lot for me to watch this again.",5,5,12,8 July 2008
Hot Fuzz," The Boys are Back in Town
",Hot fuzz the film that proves the successful transition from small to big screen of the Edgar Davis / Simon Pegg partnership accompanied by Nick Frost was more than a one off hit and does so in style. Edgar Davis shows that he is a competent director playing with different genres and even though this is a comedy all the way down the line the action sequences are well enough done to suggest that he could churn out a great action pic. Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel a high performing Police Officer who has to relocate to the country village of Sandford from London and in doing so the has to deal with more than a little culture shock at the same time as unearthing a few village secrets. The movie rattles along at a good pace with no scene wasted and at least one laugh in every scene. Pegg is ably supported once again by Nick Frost as his bumbling side kick Danny. Then as the movie unfolds we are treated to who's who of British comedy and drama filling supporting and cameo roles. I would give particular kudos to Timothy Dalton who steals pretty much every scene he is in as the magnificently sleazy Simon Skinner. The movie comes to it's inevitable conclusion that still had me laughing and certainly warrants repeated viewings.,8,1,2,22 March 2008
Home Alone," Christmas Classic
","Having just watched this for the first time in ages and at the cinema for the first time since its release I am reminded of what a fun film this is. It works very well as a feel good Christmas movie and as a live action update of a loony tunes cartoon. My feeling s about this film have not really changed at all in the eighteen years since its release. It is a small idea with a huge pay off. When Kevin (a never bettered Macualay Culkin) is left home alone over Christmas when his family leave for a trip to Paris and accidentally forget him, he is left to fend for himself as a pair of burglars tries to invade his home. For a child actor Culkin does a remarkable job practically carrying the movie on his own, appearing in pretty much every scene. The burglars are fended of in a string of comedy sequences that a very funny and aided no end by Joe Pesci playing the leader of the pair Harry. There is a convenient sub plot where Kevin finds friendship from the unlikely source of the neighbourhood old man all the kids are scared of. All in all this is a movie to be enjoyed at all times and that is guaranteed to make one feel better.",8,1,1,4 January 2009
The Jungle Book," The Greatest Disney of em all.
","Quire simply put this is animated story telling at its purest and best. This is a joy from start to finish. The story of Mogli the boy brought up by wolves forced to flee the jungle might not be as grand as the normal Disney fare and as a result actually feels like a smaller film, but that is by no means a bad thing. Instead what we have here is attention to character and this is achieved with excellence. Every character here is beautifully created all with their own nuances and traits. We have the main animal characters of Baloo and Bhaghera who are a superb odd couple duo and they and supported by a fantastic supporting cast including the magnificent King Louie and Khaa the snake. With the menacing villain Shea Khan casting a shadow over precedings we get a series of superb set pieces all set to the greatest tunes ever in a Disney film. This is a film I loved as a child and still enjoy regular viewings of today. Gold.",9,3,6,6 December 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Musical Macabre Mathem
","If there is a musical more suited to the magical Tim Burton than Sweeney Todd I will be very surprised. This really is a match made in heaven, high octaves and oceans of blood shaken into a delightful Burton cocktail. I am not familiar with he source material so do not know how faithful the movie is, but the movie had the feeling of a stage show with only a few sets used ah but what beautiful Gothic sets they are lending the movie a cartoonish Gothic feel). The songs are well staged with Johnny Depp in particular benefiting from no singing lessons delivery his lines instead with a sense of menace and madness. Depp as ever delivers a stunning performance helped as usual by Burton's camera loving him as it does his Mrs the again excellent Helena Bonham Carter, who for me gives her best performance since fight club. In the end the whole cast is marvellous with great performances given from Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall ( as Judge Turpin and his slimy assistant Beedle Bamford) and a great cameo from Sacha Baron Coen as a rival barber. The basic premise of the movie is that Sweeney Todd returns to London from unnamed location where he has been wrongfully imprisoned seeking vengeance on the man who wrongfully imprisoned him Judge Turpin. The movie is stunningly shot with some real gore so if you do not like the sight of blood then steer clear. However if you can stomach the blood then there is so much to enjoy here. Dive in to a magical fairy tale and enjoy one of Burton's finest movies.",9,0,1,28 January 2008
Burn After Reading," Craft of the highest order
","Right where to start. This in not one of the great Coen brothers movie's, but rest assured this is still so much better that most of what passes for a movie in today's day and age. It just does not hit the heights of their greatest movies but this is still a extremely well crafted movie than is really an enjoyable romp of a film. As usual with the Coen's you get great casting, direction and a script tighter than a gnat's chuff. The premises here is almost all completely a mcguffin with the supposed finding of some top secret documents and what they mean to all involved. But really with are left with a lot of unsavoury characters who all have their own agenda. All played to perfection with Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich's characters being particularly poisonous, where as the always great George Clooney and Frances McDormand are just needy. It is left to the superb Brad Pitt to give the movie heart and here he is ably supported by Richard Jenkins (the dead father from 'Six Feet Under') to give the movie its heart and soul. So life changing? No, but extremely enjoyable and full of treasures to enjoy again and again.",8,0,5,3 November 2008
Wanted," Wanted dead and alive
","Right first things first this is an extremely enjoyable action movie, but for it to work for you must suspend your sense of disbelief. With this done there is much to be enjoyed here. The premise of an agent order of assassin weavers is lets face it pretty ropey, and I am not sure how true it is to the comic source material (which I will probably dig out at some point), and Morgan Freeman is really playing it by numbers here. But we have some amazing and original action sequences that really do move the movie on at a frenetic pace. Yes we can see the massive influence of 'The Matrix' and 'Fight Club' and lets just hope if there are sequels they do not go the way of the shoddy follow ups to the Matrix. I like the fact that some of the characters are played by different actors than your normal action movie types, though to be honest I am not sure about McAvoy's American accent, though he handles everything else well. Still much better than your average action movie and worth repeat viewings if you are a fan of the genre.",7,39,67,10 March 2009
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A Spoof That Manages Sublety and Emotion
","I had no previous knowledge of this movie so came to it with no expectations only that I normally like John C Rielly, and in the end I was pleasantly surprised. This being a spoof of the story of musician's life's such as the biopic's 'Walk the Line' and 'Ray'. The film rattles along at a good pace a we trace the life and career of the title character from his unfortunate childhood through to his rock and roll break through and his long musical career that follows. This is all done well with Reilly giving the title character a sense of child like wonder well in to his adult years. The spoof is handled well and with an admirable sense of subtlety that the makers of other American spoofs would do well to notice (and I suppose you would expect some screen craft to have passed down if you are the director from the Kasdan family). The supporting cast do well given the limited scope of their roles and Jenna Fischer does well here breaking out from her role in the superb 'The Office: An American Work Place'. The film comes to a pleasing ending which manages to be much more emotional that it has any right to do and on my part at least deserves at least one other viewing.",7,0,1,4 May 2008
The Little Mermaid," The shoot from which great things grew
",This is a fascinating animated movie which rightly is known at the birth of the modern Disney animated movie (soon to be revived again thanks to John Lassiter). From a story point of view this is now thoroughly familiar fare with the main character and couple of comedy support characters having to overcome adversity before finding solace in the arms of the other main character. What is fascinating here is seeing the shaping of the modern Disney movie from some of the song themes that are re-used more successfully in later Disney movies to the beginning to experiment with 3D animation that was used to great effect in the next Disney movie 'Beauty and the Beast' . The film is itself I feel could be slightly better paces and for a Disney movie this is unusual as they are normally so tightly paced. But this is still good and great for children.,7,1,2,25 January 2009
Ghost Rider," Poop Rider
","This is a terrible movie that I was lucky enough to avoid in the cinema, and boy am I glad I did. With the spate of recent good comic book movies this is just awful. It starts with a terrible script and waste the basic premise of Ghost Rider. The direction here is shabby and about the only good thing is some of the special effects are descent especially the more than okay first Ghost Rider transformation and some of the bike scenes. The script is bad an the acting is just as wooden. Nic Cage is rotten and I am beginning to think there is no hope left for him as an actor . The bad guys are nothing to write home about and Peter Fonda is completely wasted as Satan. This should have been the beginning of a great franchise where Johnny Blaze seeks and finally gains some sort of redemption. Instead it was about me holding me head in hands and cringing. Best avoided.",2,1,2,2 December 2008
I Am Legend," Mediocre
","So here we go again. To be honest I was not expecting too much from this movie having already herd friends opinions of the movie and that coupled with my liking of 'The Omega Man' did not leave me with high expectations and I was not surprised. The premise of the last man left alive in New York as he struggles to find a vaccine to the virus that has turned a portion of New York's population in to zombies who in turn have killed anyone else who could not escape. Nothing is done badly here just averagely the story, the acting and the special effects. Thankfully at least Will Smith manages to play a character that is not himself for once but I could not work out what age he was supposed to be and was confused by the mix of grey hair and gym body. The film slips by and even when we are finally introduces some other characters I did not empathise with any of them. Actually the dog was the character I liked best. So would I watch it again? Only if really desperate and there was absolutely nothing else on.",5,0,0,3 May 2008
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Mopral Journalism, Where Did You Go?
","This is a class movie by a class director full of great subtle performances by the whole cast. Clooney directs and fills a supporting role in this movie based around the media's response to the McCarthy enquiry. David Strathairn is fantastic in the lead role of television journalist Ed Murrow who leads a one man campaign to show the public the injustice's of Senator Joe McCarthy. He stands when many would fall withstanding pressures from the network and it's associated corporations. This is a message that Clooney knows is still completely relevant today (if not more so, if you consider the American television coverage of Iraq). The film is shot in black and white given it a lovely noir type atmosphere, you can almost smell the smoked filled rooms that broadcasters habit. The films is well shot with some real nice stylistic shots that must have Lent a sly smile to Sodenberg. These is a slow movie at it certainly helps if you are a fan of Clooney or have an interest in politics and like Clooney lean to the left (which are all pluses for me), but there is also a superb supporting cast who all give fine performances including Robert Downey Jnr (being remarkably restrained) , Clooney himself, Jeff Bridges and Patricia Clarkson matching the boys with the only substantial female role. I will certainly be watching this movie again and I recommend you give it a chance.",8,1,2,6 January 2008
Grave of the Fireflies," Bleak but Excellent.
","This is a remarkable film. The sort of animated move that would never be made in the west. An animated film that deals with adult themes and achieves it with excellence. This is the story of a brother and sister orphaned by the second world war in Japan, who end up having to fend for themselves. Everything here is achieved with excellence. I watched the subtitled version (which I always feel is best) and was really taken aback by the great little film. This film deals with the harsh realities of a civilization under siege and also with Japanese culture superbly and the director here must tack a huge amount of credit. There are scenes of great emotion as the film works it's way to a hugely emotive ending. Superb. One to be viewed again and again.",8,2,3,9 December 2008
The Dark Knight," Let's do the Bat Dance Again
","Right where to start. Yes this is a fine fine move, and probably the best Batman movie to date (though I do lobe Batman Returns), but this is not the greatest movie of all time that some people and the hype would have you believe. Personally I am not even sure it is the best movie of this summer (that reward going to Wall-e). But back to the movie it's self. You will all be familiar with the basic storyline with the Batman coming up against his greatest foe the Joker. This is extremely well done and the hype is right Heath Ledger is mesmerising as the Joker (but like Jack Nicholson before him, with material like this it would have been a criminal waste had he not delivered) but like in Burton's Batman he does tend to take over the movie at the expense of Batman. Christian Bale is good here but I would want to see more of the drive and obsession that leads the Batman and the Joker to be each others counter point. I found that slightly missing and I also found the character interplay between Bruce Wayne, Alfred and Luscious a little disappointing as did I the relationship between Bruce/the Batman and Rachel. But these are minor faults when you look at the overall quality on show here. Summer movies are not normally this bold or deep or brooding and on all those points Christopher Nolan scores of the charts. This is definitely the best blockbuster since the Lord of the Rings movies. There is good if performances by numbers support form the likes of Gary Oldman as Gordon and Aaron Eckhart gives a magnificent performance as Harvey Dent. This is not a children's movie and I for one found myself thinking it has been given a slack rating by the British board as some of the scenes where very disturbing. Overall this is superb stuff glued together incredibly well that one will enjoy time and time again, it's just a shame we will not see the leads resume their battle somewhere down the line. Oh and a mention should go to Alan Moore for obviously have a massive influence on the Joker with his Killing Jone graphic novel. Great but not the greatest.",9,2,7,29 September 2008
Toy Story 2," The Bots are Back in Town
","A fine fine movie that really is a rarity in many ways. It's an animated movie which works on both the levels intended. Yes as expected it is great for children but unusually it succeeds with the jokes aimed at adults to (and as we adults know most of its competitors fail miserably there). Then we have the double whammy of a sequel that lives up to and in many cases surpasses the original (hard to think of many other candidates for that past the mighty duo of 'The Godfather Part II' & 'The Empire Strikes Back'), and that is even with Toy Story 2's story not being that far removed from that of the original! This time it is Buzz that has to save Woody but from a much more evil perpetrator than the kid next door, this time it is from an adult and not even a normal one at that a toy shop owner who intends to ship woody of to a toy museum in Japan and make himself a tidy sum in doing so. This results in a number of great set pieces which have great elements of action and comedy binding them together. As one expects from Pixar the animation is superb, but as with most of their other movies (and where so many of their competitors fail) it is the quality of the script that is the bedrock of this movie. A tight story with a cracking script that has endless one liners and equal amounts of action, comedy and pathos all welded together by some superb direction make this a timeless classic.",9,0,1,31 March 2008
Saw," Quality thrills
","Let me start by saying I for some reason had never really had any inclination to see this movie, for some reason it did not appeal to me. Well anyway I found myself watching the movie on a holiday I have just returned from and let me say I was pleasantly surprised (and pleasant it a word I would imagine you will not find associated with this movie very often). Where this movie works is in its simple premise. Cheaply made with a small set but this actually aides the suspense built up as the main characters slowly interact with one another revealing more about themselves. This is interspersed with reveals to Jigsaw the orchestrator of the two protagonist's fates. The movie moves along at a good pace introducing us to Jigsaws previous crimes as well as the police officers on his trail with a increasing sense pf dread and the payoff is worth it (as much as these things can be) with a very satisfactory ending. Yes there are some horrific moments but nowhere near as many as I expected and I believe the movie is better for this. A must for horror fans, and others with a strong constitution.",8,1,3,10 March 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Knocking on heavens door
","I came to this movie with very low expectations. I have not read the book upon which it is based, and had read and heard only bad things about this movie. To add to this I have never been a great fan of Ron Howard's movies or of the films of Tom Hanks. But I have to say this movie without being anything exceptional, was nowhere near as bad as I expected. The fact that the movie bashes organised religion was always going to appeal to me, but I do not have a clue how much of the background of this story is based on fact of if it is all fiction. The film it's self is probably to long at two and a half hours and it seemed to really drag towards the end. However it was reasonably well directed without being anything special. There where a few trite moments which felt forced just to move the plot along, but all the acting was fine I think the script really did play the characters out as national caricatures All in all not as bad as expected but I would not watch it again.",5,0,2,4 January 2008
Enemy at the Gates," Good but not great
","There is a lot to recommend about this film that is essentially the story of the duel between a Russian and German sniper set against the backdrop of the Battle for Stalingrad in the Second World War. This is a well made movie that benefits from European direction and seems less bombastic than American made Second World War efforts and is all the better for it. There are good performances her as well especially by Rachel Weisz as the female lead Tania and Bob Hoskins is a fantastic supporting role as Kruschev. Joseph Fiennes is also very good as Danilov. My major problem with the movie is Jude Law. I just do not get the appeal of this actor. He seems to deliver the same performances in every movie I have seen him in, and for me this only worked in AI. This resulted in me not being able to invest in the lead character and I felt it also led to Ed Harris completely dominating there duel from an acting perspective (does he ever deliver a bad performance). This is a shame because the rest of the movie is excellent. Though I am not sure how much weight can be given to the historical accuracy (not that much from what I red on IMDb). In the end I enjoyed this film but Law puts me off wanting to watch this movie again unless there really was nothing else to watch.",7,1,3,24 January 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Jack is Black and Back
",Jack oh how you rock. Let Jack of the leash and you do invariably get variations of a familiar character all of which I suspect are close to Mr. Black himself. So whilst this in my opinion is not a bad movie and does indeed have some very funny scenes. Liking this movie is I think going to depend if you like Jack himself. Yes it's crude and yes we have seen Jack do this many times before (this character is just a more adult version of his school of rock character). The premise of the movie is Jack and his co-star and fellow 'tenacious' member Kyle Glass go on a journey that is both physical and spiritual to reclaim the pick of destiny the movie is named after .What we get is basically a series of sketches that vary in degrees of humour. A few good cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins and an ending that one spots from pretty much from the beginning but it's enjoyable without being great. I may watch this again but would not seek it out.,6,0,0,7 March 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Yippee Kay Again
","So here we go again. This is the second time I have watched this movie in the last year and it holds up well. I do like this film and as an action movie it has aged remarkably well. We all know the premise its McLean again getting caught up in the mother of all days. This time we get the addition of Samuel L Jackson as Zeus making it more of a joint effort and a buddy movie. Lets be upfront this is nowhere near as good as the original, but still miles ahead of Die Harder. In Jeremy Irons portrayal of Simon Gruber (brother of Hans) we have a much better adversary than die harder, my only gripe is that there is not enough physical interaction between Gruber and McLean. I also think the film suffers from not being contained in a restricted area, therefore losing the originals sense of claustrophobia. But to the pluses Willis, Jackson and Iron's really deliver by numbers yet excellent performances that lift the movies performances above that of the standard action movie. We have some great if a little over the top set pieces and the payoff we all expect yet want. An action move to be enjoyed over and over again.",8,0,0,4 January 2009
WALL·E," Pixar's Greatest Achievement
","This put simply is a stunning film. A triumph on every level imaginable. Animation to make your jaw drop (Pixar raising the bar once again) tied to a great story (ok the green message is a little preachy) with little to no wasted scenes and what we have here is arguably the greatest CG animated movie ever made and quite possibly one of the greatest animated movies of all times. It was very bold of Pixar to move away from their tried and trusted buddy movie formula, and even bolder to make a movie which is for the most part a silent film. The humans' only enter the third and weakest act of the movie and then probably draw away from the always captivating Wall-e and Eve. The simple premise of the movie is that of Wall-e a robot whose sole purpose is to clean up the mess of the earth they abandoned long ago. Wall-e has a fascination for all things human which we are not sure where this comes from? Is this the result of circuits malfunctioning of just a loneliness from apparently being the last working robot left on earth? All we see is Wall-e one relationship he has is with his pet cockroach. This in it's self could probably carry the movie, bit when you add the relationship Wall-e eventually strikes up with the Female robot sent on a mission to earth (Eve) you really do get cinema magic that captivated the whole of the cinema I saw the movie in, from adults to the full range of children. Andrew Stanton has at this point an impeccable record off delivering films of the highest quality and if he did not work under the Pixar umbrella would probably receive a more star billing that his output deserves. This is that one off. A movie for the ages pure brilliance. Oh and to top if of the short that accompanies is 'Presto' is brilliant as well. Pixar's homage to Loony Tunes reminds us of the crime that we get in not seeing those classics on TV anymore and have to put up with pony modern versions of them.",10,1,4,5 October 2008
Iron Man," Tinned Goods
","Comic book movies are a strange bunch. You just can never be sure which are going to be good are which are not. Then too add to that it is not always the good one's which strike it rich at the box office. But hey good news here is a film that scores on both fronts. As per standard with a super hero movie the first film in the expected franchise we start with the origin movie, and for me not being an Iron Man fan boy this is where it begins to help. The story is now updated with billionaire playboy and mechanics genius Tony Stark (played fantastically here by Robert Downey Jnr) gets kidnapped in Afghanistan where his captors want him to build them a weapon. Stark builds his prototype Iron Man suit to esacpe. The film is fast paced and brings Iron man into the modern world fantastically. There are relevant questions asked about the morality of weapons trading and the role of corporations with Jeff Bridges particularly menacing in the role of the main villain, and man does he also have a big head. There are good nods to the comic for the fan boys out there and the support cast does well with limited roles. Mix in a nice dose of humor which does not feel out of place and we have the beginnings of a very successful franchise which will please almost everyone. Oh and stay for the end of the credits fans. Definitely one I will be viewing again and probably purchasing.",8,1,2,14 June 2008
Pineapple Express," Good but not Gold
","This is an enjoyable movie that serves the buddy genre well. Whilst not a great movie and not a comedy classic (and let's be honest there are very few of them) this is a good fun movie. A comedy that mixes in action aiming well and truly and the younger male demographic. This could easily have been awful. But instead what we have here is the story of two pretty average guys who go about their business under the radar. Seth Rogan is well cast as Dale Denton and equally good is James Franco playing against type casting as small time drug dealer Sail Silver. When a crime is witnessed by Dale the pair end up pursued by a criminal cartel headed by the excellent Gary Cole and Rosie Perez. They are pursued by a couple of henchmen and they also hook up with a buddy 'Red'. The minor roles are well drawn out which adds to the charm of the movie. The film is well directed though I found myself loosing interest at times. So maybe could have been a little tighter in the editing. But overall I would definitely give the director David Gordon Green another chance and will see more of his films, and will probably end up watching the film a good few more times.",7,0,2,29 September 2008
