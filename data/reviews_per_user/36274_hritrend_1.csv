Iron Man 3," Sorry Iron Man 1
","Iron Man or as some one called it Irony Man, a mixture of action and comedy not good. Sorry, I waited so long for that film but after the Iron man 1 and 2 and The Avengers - that film is not funny it is tragic :( I just went out of the theater weithout any good thoughts, I'm lost now after I saw the film and there was no good idea, just some funny moments - it seems that the producer was joking with the Iron Man, he made a fun on him ................ but at least the ending was good - he drove away and sai 'I'm the Iron man' so there is hope for better film 4 or the coming Avengers. But I will not recommend this move to any one.",3,10,20,28 April 2013
