Million Dollar Arm," Average up until the end
","As another reviewer stated, this is a bit predictable, with your underdog character and not too likable agent whose main interests are image and the lifestyle that accompanies it. Maybe I am being a bit harsh, as all of the main actors, with the exception of Alan Arkin, were not familiar to me, and hence at least they were refreshing in a way. The storyline has some funny moments, and real on-set locations in India. Also refreshing to see a movie these days with no foul language or sex or nudity. What made the movie for me though, was the the ending and the credits at the end, which made the characters and story much more real and personal. A good family film.",7,0,0,9 April 2015
The Intouchables," A rich funny movie which will make you laugh and cry
","I saw that this movie had made it on the top 250 list rather quickly so I had to go see it. From the opening scene, the movie kept you engaged with its memorable characters, which provide great chemistry with each other. Makes you wonder if a price can be put on your health and freedom. I had to ask myself if I would trade places with Philippe, with all his status and material riches, but to be totally dependent on a caretaker for the most basic of daily tasks. The Driss character was a total contrast and provided what Philippe could not provide on his own, not just from a physical viewpoint. When I went to see this it was only playing in one theater in the Chicagoland area, a shame that a quality films doesn't get the distribution while the mass marketed produced junk that Hollywood churns out pushes out rich films like this one. Hopefully it will be released in DVD soon.",9,1,2,11 October 2012
Chariots of Fire," A Beautiful Film
","I first saw this when it was released in theaters 30 years ago. Watching it again, I was struck how beautiful the film was, from the musical score, the costuming, and the location, all capturing well, the feel of Cambridge, England in the 1920's. The framing, use of slow motion and the colors are top notch. The acting, superb. This time around, I noticed the contrasting characters of the driven and confident Harold Abrams, and the humble Eric Liddle maintaining his integrity and faithfulness, yet both arriving at their goals via differing routes. The film stands out even more so now against the steady stream of mass produced Hollywood movies with all the blockbuster names and special effects do not come close to touching the heart and soul of a work of art like this film. It is a bit slow and requires the viewer to invest some focus and attention rather than be entertained, but the reward in the end is that much greater.",9,1,1,25 December 2011
