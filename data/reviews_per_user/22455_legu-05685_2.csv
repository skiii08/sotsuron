Scarface," Briliant film with breathtaking plot
","Yesterday, I watched «Scarface» by director Bryan De Palma. The main roles are played by Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer and Robert Loggia. This film is a remake of the movie which was made in 1932. Well, here is my review of it.Firstly, I'd like to point out Al Pacino's acting game, because it's excellent. His character is notable and seems the most real unlike the other ones, indeed. However, in my opinion, I couldn't understand his motivation in it, because Tony Montana's developing from a simple cooker to big drug boss happened too fast. It seems that he was cold-blooded murder so many years before he joined mafia. In other ways, I got no complaints for this film, I liked it.Secondly, soundtrack of «Scarface» is brilliant. While listening this soundtrack , you can feel the spirit of criminal 80-s and it's amazing feeling.In conclusion, I'd like to say that this movie was made on the highest level. And I believe that your feelings after watching it will be unique, and after all, you will never forget them.",9,0,0,28 March 2020
Fight Club," Amazing movie which twists minds
","In my opinion, this film is brilliant. Acting game, plot-- everything in this film are beautiful, especially Tayler Durden who was played by Brad Pitt. And at the same time, this movie makes you to think about your vital values. But i noticed one disadvantage in this film- acting game of Helena Bonem Carter. Her character was badly described, in my opinion. And while watching for her actions, she seems very excess. But generally, thi film is awesome",8,0,0,26 March 2020
