Ford v Ferrari," One of the best movies I've ever seen in long time
","I like the movie a lot, one of the best in so much a long time, the two lead actors nailed their roles and the story line is so good, effects and CGI are both great and the movie pretty much tells a story of faith and hard work on top of talent.",10,13,16,10 February 2020
Brave," Hands down the best animated movie I have seen in my life
","Brave tells a beautiful story of coming of age, a story of a person with extreme talent, extreme self-esteem, extreme strong personality, a story that gives hope that no matter how hard things are, no matter how much one misses up, there will always be a way to make things right at the end and to grow up along the way, that there need to be strength and determination for a person to prove themselves right, that talent is so precious a person holding it is so hard for others to reach, this is the best animated movie I have ever seen hands down, thank you Pixar, thank you Disney for this incredible movie!!",10,0,0,10 February 2020
