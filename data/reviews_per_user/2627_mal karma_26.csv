The Rock," One Of The Best Action Films (SpoilerS)
","It is really a well done movie with a terrific cast (Connery, Cage, Harris, Morse, Biehn, beautiful Claire Forlani). Ed Harris gave it all as General Francis Hummel making this one of the best performances I've seen (perhaps I'm exagerating a bit but I liked it anyway) and that he's done (see also God wannabe Cristof from Truman Show). Besides of what the script and the characters thought and said of Hummel (a good man after all) I was really simpathetic to him to the point I regreted his death a lot.Good props and uniforms and locations too, and an excellent score with that particular tune that is played on every Bay/Bruckheimer film.
Although there was nothing really bad with the script, I was actually sorry for those SEALs that got screwed as soon as they entered the Rock, which anyway was good to the plot. Only complaint is that it seems to be too inaccurate about technical stuff sometimes. All in all, one of the best (strictly) action films ever made, if not the best.......... 9/10",8,2,2,2 September 2002
The Blair Witch Project," Dissapointing
","I heard over and over again that this movie was a big blockbuster that was really cheap and made a LOT of money that made it the best inversion in filming industry ever... so I had to see it... and it sucked terribly. It had no intersting plot or actors or even worthviewing locations... yeah I know that it's an independent movie, but also is Reservoir Dogs, which I love... c'mon it's just not scary at all and has one of the crappiest endings i've seen. Totaly dissapointing even for watching with friends.",5,0,2,22 June 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Too nice to me
","Even though certainly it's a more charming being, the aliens from HR Giger (the Alien saga in other words) fit much better into my scheme of what it's supossed to be a movie about extraterrestrials, drooling and slaughtering anybody who gets in their way: I mean they MUST be mean. This is a child story 'about friendship, comprehension, love, etc etc etc' hell no! I may be too sadistic or morbid, anyway I didn't enjoy it neither when I saw it for the first time like 8 years ago. ET is uglier than a Predator without mask. Although I did enjoyed when on a sketch with Sigourney Weaver at SNL the marines making a lampoon on Aliens killed ET by mistake.",Null,2,5,2 September 2002
Training Day," The Moral Responsabilities Of Being A Cop
","8/10Alonzo Harris is an experienced LAPD narcotics cop, who's been given the task to train the almost rookie Jake Hoyt. Harris will show him the streets, and will actually make him feel part of it. Harris' performance repulses Hoyt, but there's something that at the same time makes him admire him. Probably this will happened to the spectator as well. Partly because of the script, and mostly because Mr Washington knows how to be convincing to everyone listening. Hoyt will have to make a quick decision about if being a cop is really what he was expecting, therefore what he wants to be. Harris makes it sound like the only way possible to work in the narcotics division. But it's up to Hoyt to make a decision.The most remarkable, though there is nothing wrong with the directing, the script, etc, are the performances. Washington is really convincing and will make you doubt, you won't know when you have just crossed the thin (white) line  between cop duty and illegality and corruption. And Ethan Hawk should have really won the Academy Award as Hoyt. these performances kill, in more than one way.This kind of great police dramas make me want to know and watch more about the genre.Btw, who the hell said it was a comedy?! it is funny watching as Hoyt smokes the dope that Alonzo gives him to 'be on the streets', but what else?",8,0,11,16 September 2002
Fight Club," Started so well... (SPOILER) 5/10
","At first it was an interesting idea that David Fincher was developing perfectly. Good funny jokes and a tremendous camera working. I was even convinced by the actors, which I would have never believed being this a movie with Brad Pitt: after watching him as Tyler Durden I actually started to like some of hs work. But I started to get annoyed by Edwards Norton's inner monologues. Too annoyed. And I started to disagree (a bit, actually) with some things the characters did or say. And then we get to the bottom of the plot: Pitts' character is in Norton's imagination. Imagination is what the writer had. Or a lack of it actually. Probably he started writing the stroy and didn't know how to finish it.Yes, probably I'm just missing something like a crude critic to a consumist society or the human search for excitement and changes and to cut with the rutine.Anyway, I didn't like the movie because when it comes to entertain it stucks in the middle of the road. You could even say it's too artistic for it's lack of sense at a surrealistic level as a Dal√≠ painting. But there's actually no reason you can't see it and come up with your own conclusions. And forget my English and some wrongfully used terms. But you get the point.",Null,0,1,31 August 2002
The Fifth Element," One Of The Best Films Ever
","I couldn't stop watching it, and I can't, I see it every time it appears on TV, I even read the book. The plot is nothing less than original although it is basically good vs evil. The performances are adequate and good/great: Willis, Holm, Jovovich (yummy), Tucker (funny as hell) and specially Gary Oldman as the madman zOrg making once again an incredible villain. The FX and the sound/music are supreme. It's a shining view of the world in the future and I loved the flying cars & taxi. But I'm more used to films such as Aliens and Starship Troopers, that tend to be a little more conservative when it comes to clothing and ships, because Fifth Element is thought to be more creative and artistic, so it was a little hard to swallow. Neverthless I love this movie and anyone should have a great time with this uncommon mix of action, comedy (except the Lethal Weapon saga), and Sci Fi.
It's even worth watching only to have a look at this Ucranian heavenly creature known as Milla. 9/10 Have fun.",9,0,1,6 September 2002
X-Men," (F)X Men: Take a good look at this jewel
","I've seen X Men like ten times on TV and I regret not seeing it on theater. The FX, amazing. The performances are superb, specially for a Sci-Fi/Action/Comic Book film with a shining MacKellen. The cast itself is remarkable, mixing hardcore action performers with award-winning actors. Bryan Singer is a not-that-young talent, I've seen most of his movies (X-Men, Stephen King's Apt Pupil & the best crime movie except for the Godfather of course, Usual Suspects) and he shows his good taste for the visual here. If you don't like the fact that sometimes it doesn't follow the comic book or the beloved cartoon, Screw You. Or don't like the plot, blame Stan Lee. But the plot, while not *intelligent* or *subtile* is very real, after all it's nothing else than Martin Luther King vs Malcolm X; ironic, isn't it, the fact that Magneto is Malcolm and not Professor X. It's a tremendous film that deserves a sequel, oh, right, it'll have one, no surprise, after all it left everything prepared for one.By the way, it DID HAD character development, I can come out with some sort of profile about 'em, those who didn't see it have no perception at all. Screw You Too. And the silver and gray lighting in some parts of the movie are delightful to the eye. Special mention for the X Women: Famke Jansen, Halle Berry & Rebecca Romijn are in my hot list of the hottest chicks. That adds a couple of points to this film's rating.Oh, don't forget to see the sequel so that it becomes a sheer success and we may have X3 & X4; it actually looks darker (not the lights, the plot and violence/action) and will luckily bring us a better prospect 'bout the X World and the X Guys themselves (it'll be great to see more mutants than the first one, shame they still won't bring my favorite, Gambit, yet).Rating: 12/10 (yeah, I gave it a 9 before, but to be faithful to the comments...)",8,0,0,31 August 2002
Snatch," One Of The Best Crime Movies Ever
","Three different gangs go after the same huge diamond...I'm really starting to like the genre. Don't know what Guy Ritchie has done before (besides Lock Stock...), to me he is just Madonna's new boyfriend. But this is one hell of a movie. The criminal point of view has never been so funny.I couldn't stop laughing with all the jokes and silly things. I've seen a cow that just doesn't die before, but when one of the criminals is shot (not gonna tell who) and doesn't die, it's hilarious, and it was a great touch not showing him as he agonizing.The black guys gang was the best, they could fail on everything they did and still come out alive.It was a good cast without first line actors, of course I'm not talking about Mr Pitt. His gypsy character was terrific, he had a mind of his own and didn't care about everyone else.And when you think the film has consumed every way out and is doomed to have a lame ending, something happens and there you are again watching bodies roll and a lot of people chasing the same stone.Also some of editing was outstanding, like when Dennis Farina flies to London and with the best scene of all, the car crash... I guess these people have 9 lives because when it seems they're dead, the come out again and again the rolling bodies...Enough talking, I'll give this one a 9/10 just because",9,0,1,16 September 2002
Top Secret!," Is It Stupid And Brainless? So Much Better!!!
","The Abrahms-Zucker-Zycker trio has given us the best dumb comedies ever: Airplane! (not the pathetic sequel) and the Hot Shots! and Naked Gun sagas. Not to mention this one, which became my favorite comedy as a child. All I cared about were the scenes at the German prison with the guard breaking like glass and the jeep exploiding after a simple 'tling'. That was good then and now I like it much more. The French resistance is hilarious. When I caught the English version and heard the black guy's name I laughed at my ass for 5 minutes! and I don't mind that much about the dubbed version because it is mostly visual gags and not much spoken humour. But the best of all were the German soldiers with their big boots and the big giant phone. There are movies with good and inteligent humour, but I have no doubt that the stupid jokes will make you laugh harder with every time you see it. The trio has better movies, but to be their second major one, it rocks.By the way, half an hour ago I finally got to understand the 'prop room' joke. Cool.",10,0,3,14 September 2002
The Bourne Identity," What does a cold war product have to do?
","Overall and excellent film. Bourne and the rest of the Treadstone program are arguably the deadliest men alive (those who survived at least). Smart and dangerous. In my opinion this is what modern spy thrillers should look like, how do men without an enemy act? soldiers need an enemy, and if there isn't one, they create it. Tension moves along with the story. But then something goes wrong.On a more technical side, the dialog could have been better, but it is both the (tacital) narration and the acting what carries the plot of the movie. Of course, the characters ain't poets and philosophers, they are CIA agents, trained assassins, and a German bohemian lady. Then we have the great action and chase scenes. Plus, one thing that never ceases to amaze me, perhaps the only series of movies filmed almost entirely on-location, a remarkable feature.I have the same opinion for Supremacy, and can't wait for Ultimatum.",9,0,1,9 April 2007
U-571," Thanx God I Didn't Pay The Whole Ticket
","I mean I went with my school, still don't know why. OK, it is not that bad really, it has a promising plot that resembles more like a Medal of Honor video game, and a respectful cast. What was that I didn't like? the sub. There was no way you could sink that son of a bitch iron sausage. Torpedoe-it. Depth Charge-it. Shoot-at it. Sabotage-it. But it just wouldn't sink. I've seen better, but you can give it a try.",6,1,3,16 September 2002
Apocalypse Now," Mixed Feelings (Redux Version)
","insanity, colonialism, cold war, death, life, desire, reality, fear, duty, etc. all of these subjects get a a part in Apocalypse Now, all of them are interestig and are also well developed. but they tend to be too developed, enough for a +3 hours movie. it is waaaaay too long and slow to move on, i believe coppola made some scenes longer deliverately  because he just wanted to. i didn't like brando as the mad man rogue colonel (and check out the trivia he probably didn't like it either), but dennis hopper and robert duvall give the best performances in Apoc, specially duvall and his chopper assault, by far the best scene of the movie.you were suppose to hate kurtz and consider him just a mad man who had to be stopped. you are to love kilgore for his way of watching the whole war (basically it meant moving to the next position to find the better waves) and his behaviour towards the enemy. but it is not clear what to say about willard.it was a mistake to make the kurtz's stronghold scenes so long, and not to include the french farm part which thankfully was in the redux version and showed a third point of view about vietnam.i bet coppola could have made this movie far more interesting and catching if he had wanted to.",Null,0,0,8 January 2003
Resident Evil," Not Bad, Not Too Great
","8/10***Spoilers***Let's make this clear: I'm a huge fan of the video-game, I've played Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 & the dissapointing Gun Survivor. So I was really looking forward to this one. Which falls on every common spot and/or cliche in horror movies, like only two survivors (the chick and the guy), a fast wipe out of the rescue team and the facility overtaken by the zombies. Alright, this time I'll let this one go 'cos it's just the same plot as the video game, which, OK, IS a bit dumb (Blame Capcom!). But I was anyway surprised--very-- by the directing. Paul W.S. Anderson has always been giving us only crappy work except perhaps for the mediocre Event Horizon, so aside the fact that I love the Videogame, he didn't do such a bad work. Specially when it comes to the environment, I mean specifically the blue and grey lighting which fitted really good in this very claustrophobic movie, and the filming location is a bit similar to those from the games. Which this movie gets close enough to, hopefully it will be even more faithful in the sequel, after all it's gonna have some characters from the games.So, basically this is the best...no... only good videogame to screen conversion to date. It is not as scary as other films, or even less then the VG, but this is probably due to the predictable nature of it.Minor stars, but good looking ones (don't get me wrong, I only have eyes for Milla Jovovich; hey, I even have a wallpaper from this movie with her on it) and perhaps with a bright future. But who knows.Anyway it has some good moments and is very well done for a budget that wasn't that big. I just liked it and recommend watching it with an open mind, specially if you're a die hard fan of the RE saga or a die hard fan of B movies.
Yes, it's more flesh eating zombies vs (not that) good guys. Nothing new to the genre but nothing bad either.",8,0,0,16 September 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Can't Help It, Didn't Like It
","Take a blockbuster and quality movies director such as Steven Spielberg, a good leading actor like Tom Hanks and a decent cast (Tom Sizemore and Edward Burns are my choices) and you'll get the best movie ever. Or you should at least. Steve got this one wrong in my opinion. Starting and ending the movie with a US flag isn't the way of making a movie hat will be shown throughout the world. The allied assault on Normandy was amazing and close to reality (I believe), making it the most remembered scene in the movie (and best).But then the plot sinks in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. Yes, sending 8 soldiers to rescue 1 just because his brothers are dead does seem unlikely and I wouldn't risk the lives of a capable platoon for only one soul.
And making that chickenheart corporal Upham's mind change fast enough to make him shoot an unarmed man at point blank does nothing good to this movie.Overrated; The Thin Red Line and Black Hawk Down are much better. It's not bad, really, but I just can't figure out what the hell is so goo about it.",Null,1,1,2 September 2002
Event Horizon," Nothing Really Bad With It (SPOILERS)
","I made a mistake: I rented it before watching 'Alien' so I couldn't compare EH with Ridley Scott's masterpiece of Sci Fi horror. But anyway this is pretty good movie for Paul Anderson who's been giving us some crappy work for most of his life (except EH and RE). It's completely bloody and explicitly violent and it's not a bad thing: think of it as Tarantino in a spaceship. And it delivers an invisible type of horror without an alien monster, where the only real monster is what's inside the human head. I got really scared with unpredictable scenes and a terrific cast starting with Sam Neil. Somebody said (in his comments, complaining) that the EH ship looked like a torture chamber, well I believe that this was made on purpose, my friend, that's exactly one of the many ways the movie is supossed to treat the fear, with those creepy and spooky elements, equal to a new kind of terror. You know it: hell only exists inside human minds, and it's arrived.",7,0,2,6 September 2002
Black Hawk Down," Overwhelming
","That's pretty much what I thought of it. Overwhelming and shocking.Listen, I'm sick of tose who say that it's unrealistic, I'm sure that at least 99 per cent of those who say so have never been to combat or enlisted armed forces or even shot a weapon. This is the closest I've been to combat and hope to be, so then I can tell you that Ridley Scott did a terrific job with this movie where I felt I was another Delta shootting with my rifle.
About comparing BHD and SPR, you're right: that's not possible because BHD is so much better than SPR. And more gory (SPR didn't have an artery operation, a severed finger and a half a torso lieing on the battlefield). SPR had TOO many patriotic stuff, and BHD only has US (I refuse to use the word 'American') flags, small ones, on the soldiers BDU's, that's a good thing.BDH has, also, what most war movies should (but don't) have:<ul><li>Be based on a real war operation (Normandy or Guadalcanal are OK) - Have A LOT of characters: and you shouldn't know either their ranks or names. They all carry the same weapons and dress alike. I say it 'cos I can tell you all the names of the squad on Ryan's. - Focus only on the battle: when somebody's shootting at you with an   AK 47 or RPG I don't think they start telling each other why they love their wives or what happened when his father left home many years ago. And check it out, the only woman who appears on screen isn't on it for more than 5 seconds.</li></ul>Giving a deeper analysis on the Rangers or Deltas as normal peoplewould have just ruined the movie. It makes it better when you concentrate on the battle. The political side of the operation is thankfully only the kind of 'what a hell are we doing here' or 'you cannot change the world this way'. It gives some credit to the Somalis as people, though I've seen what they did with the 61 crew and it was pretty horrible. The acting was fair specially Sizemore, and the few funny stuff ok. The action scenes are really good although there seems to be nothing that looks like a shrapnel, mostly coming from the RPG's. But (yeah, I have a complaint) there is one thing that doesn'tmake sense: i've heard that the cassualties from the somali side where from 1000 to 10000. So where the hell are those 500 Somalis that didn't get killed?OK, I've said enough. Basically I say Go BHD, Down with SPR, the most overestimated film ever. This is THE war film, watch it's good from beggining to end. 11/10",10,0,0,29 June 2002
This Is Spinal Tap," Out Of Date, Still Really Good
","It is out of date, yes, but isn't the Godfather out of date too? well this one you can tell even more 'cos it's a music genre, '80s hard rock with touches of glam and always leather pants and long hair (hate it, hate it, hate it), that is quite out of date. But is one of the best parodies of music industry. Everytime I see a documentary or road movie from another silly new band on MTV (the most treachorous network in the world) I remember this film and it makes gives me the sense that the network is just ridiculous--no, wait, it IS ridicoulous!Oh, and Michael McKean is a great comediant",7,3,9,16 September 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Much Better Than Pulp Fiction
","You can really tell this one is Tarantino's first (major?) work. It has a great cast, terrific script, really good performances and breathtaking scenes. And it has what Pulp Fiction did not realize, a better storyline with a more convincing plot. The anonimacy that we get dragged into works perfectly well and allow us to think by ourself, and come up with our very own character development. Perhaps with some more runtime it could have been among my Top 5.9/10",9,0,1,26 September 2002

","Nothing. Jodie Foster is as annoying as she always is and Anthony Hopkins proves to me that this is his only worth movie and that's enough saying. I love good crime/thrillers like Usual Suspects, Reservoir Dogs and Memento, but this one does nothing to the genre. Pure gore and no suspense, lots of blood but no sugar. Hannibal Lecter can't be that smart to scape everywhere he is, he's like 65, for God's sake, is he really strong enough to overcome a 110 kg prison guard? adn was he the only way to get the main criminal jailed? please.

","This has been the best western movie I have seen and liked. Even though they aren't many, this is still one of my favorite films of all times.
Specially good is the casting and the acting, lots of good actors doing fine and ground breaking performances. If all far west movies could be like this one, it could become my favorite genre. It's a shame I haven't seen it for quite some years, I could use some of it in order to recover from so much garbage out there on cable.If you like westerns, you'll like Tombstone.

Heat," Two Great Actors In One Great Movie
","De Niro & Pacino shine together even though they don't share almost no time on screen. The rest of the cast and performances are either OK or adequate, and it has a good script too, with some of the greatest filming locations in LA in Hollywood's history. But what is really, and the only thing that beats Pacino and De Niro together, was the bank shooting, which to me ranks as one of the best action sequences ever.8/10 because some lack of substance, anyway a terrific job.",8,0,0,26 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It Is Not That Good Really
","Don't get me wrong. I like the Star Wars Saga. It was really cool even for the late seventies. But come on, there are some other good sci fi films around like the first two Alien. Star Wars has become nothing else but the biggest franchise ever and Geaorge Lucas has almost no talent (just like Peter Jackson). If a director is good, then he'll make more than 6 movies that all look alike and have a straight storyline. And only one good or at least popular actor in the first 3/ last 3? of course I mean Harrison Ford.
 Just get over it. It is nothing else than a nice movie from 25 years ago. There are many more good movies out there that don't involve pathetic actors and director.",Null,0,1,26 September 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Outstanding Comedy From 1975 England
","I love it. it has terrific jokes that made me laugh and think at the same time, always having racism, prejudice and social standards showing off. Excelent combination of fisical humour and inteligent lines, with a low budget, meaning good, production. The black knight, the knights that say Ni, the rabbit and the holy grenade, the witch trial, the Troya rabbit, the Anthrax castle and everything else in this movie make this the very best comedy ever, beating classics like Naked Gun, Hot Shots and Austin Powers.9/10",10,1,2,26 September 2002
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," rednecks get funny
","Going straight to video (here at least), makes this a movie hard to understand for non-Americans. I just had too little information about Nascar racing, but I made the effort, and in the end I really liked it. Not many major laughs, but a great time overall. It has tremendous cast too. Sometimes the comedy got repetitive, and the 'frat pack' feeling was notorious.The only drawback to note is, precisely, the effort I had to put to like it.Special mention for the guy who is not only French but openly homosexual also.",7,0,2,9 April 2007
The Godfather," The Best of All Time
","It's remarkable how a film 30 years old can still amaze even teens (I'm 17, you know). It has an incredible script and its filming is just perfect. It doesn't have any flaw, and probably the best highlight is its cast with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, etc. etc. etc., all of them shine thru the movie and make this (too) long film most enjoyable despite the extreme length. With two worth viewing sequels (specially Godfather II with the majestic Robert De Niro), The Godfather is best saga in history of movies, much, but much more than Star Wars. The one and only classic in movie history, the best of all times that can never be beaten.",10,0,1,15 August 2002
