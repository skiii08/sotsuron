3:10 to Yuma," Freaking awesome action movie
","Wow! this movie is just awesome, the opening scene you start out thinking whats going on, then bam! the action starts,I hadn't seen the original, so this was all new to me, the whole movie is full of amazing acting, and incredible action, i love the story too and the action was very well done with the fighting scenes, which there are plenty. The two main actors play their roles perfectly, Gladiator and Batman heh. Russel Crowe is a great villain and pulled off a role i didn't think he'd pull off well. The movie is suspenseful from start to finish and a great film to go see in the theaters. The ending fight will blow you away, now i want to see the original!",10,1,3,11 September 2007
Spider-Man 2," Greatest Comicbook Film to date
","This is truly an incredible film, tons of action, romance, rivalries, and the problems of everyday life in New york City.Spider-man 2 captures the feel of spider-man perfectly, this is how super heroes would actually live their lives, it's never easy.All Characters go all out in this one, Peter, MJ, Harry, Doc ock,even Jameson is great, if you liked the first, then this is a must see.If you don't own this one, just go get Spider-man 2.1, it has all that great extra stuff and gives you a preview of spider-man 3. Best Spidey film ever.I just have one question, can Spidey 3 top it??",10,0,1,22 April 2007
Spider-Man 3," Fantastic, best film of the year, but...... we were expecting that weren't we?
","I have many mixed thoughts going through my head after seeing the midnight screening of spider-man 3.1. It was awesome 2. Great fx 3. Great length But, afterwards, i was a little disappointed, i still love the movie and it was fantastic, but was it really worth the 1 1/2 year wait?? No, it wasn't', this film is a masterpiece, but it was hyped way too much and my expectations were a bit too high i now realize.But i say no matter what, go see this movie, if you don't go see this movie, then you're missing out.Ps- Venom is awesome",10,10,17,4 May 2007
Batman Begins," The Greatest film of our Time
","I saw this In Imax 2 years ago, and went in not expecting anything but a fun little superhero movie, holy crap, what i got, was my favorite movie of all time.Acting- the best acting i've seen in a film, Christian Bale was Incredible, he was so into his character and pulled of playing Bruce Wayne and Batman very well. Most of the actors in the last saga were either a good Bruce Wayne, or a good Batman, and Christian Bale pulled both off. Other than him, the rest of the cast was amazing, every single person, i cannot pick someone in the film who wasn't outstanding.Story- What made this Films story different from almost all superhero movies, is that it wasn't just that a Bad guy is causing trouble and the superhero has to save the day, Batman Begins showed his journey to becoming the hero, and in a very detailed manor. The Villain wasn't an average bad guy either, and i won't tell you who he was because i don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.All I can really say is that if you have not seen this film, than you truly are missing out. I have seen it at least 20-30 times, no joke, and every time it amazes me even more.10 out of 10",10,3,4,15 June 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantastic, is the only way to put it
","Let's start out by saying that fantastic four 2 is much better than it's predecessor. Better story, better acting, great new character, and great humor.Story- The Silver Surfer comes to Earth to destroy it because his ruler Galactus has to feed off of other planet's destruction. This story actually worked very well, i liked how the surfer was mainly doing it without thinking about it, towards the end, Susan convinces him that it isn't right and the Surfer tells Galactus that he will no longer serve him, and leading on to the ending.Acting-Mr. Fantastic: ehh, he was the weaker of the four, some scenes he didn't look like he was totally into it. Invisible Woman: A tad better, some scenes she was absolutely superb, and others.....Human Torch: In my opinion he was the best of the whole bunch, his humor was flat out hilarious, and when he needed to be serious, he could be serious. The Thing: About the same as the first film, not bad, but not perfect, some times you coulden't understand him too well,but other than that he was fine.Characters- Silver Surfer was amazing, he looked great, and was just a really cool character to watch. Doctor Doom was Iffy, In my honest opinion, he shoulden't have been in the film at all, he just wasn't needed, i would have loved to see them fight it off with Galactus.Ending- Doesn't give away anything, but leaves you wanting more and knowing that there will be a sequel, and the Silver Surfer will be sure to be in it.9 out of 10 stars",9,7,14,15 June 2007
Transformers," Best Film of the Summer
","Man oh man, i saw this at the midnight showing, not thinking it would be too great, but wow, it was incredible, i wasn't too sure, so i got around to seeing it again, and yup, i was right, this movie is awesome.The Acting is fantastic, Shia Labeouf is rising in Hollywood, with Disturbia, and now this. He does a great job in this movie and there isn't a single time i think he isn't into it.The Special Fx are amazing, the Transformers look great, all of them, the fighting scenes are a blast to watch.The Story is pretty simple, stop Megatron from receiving the cube or all hell will break loose and we all die. But it plays out well, and more detail is added into it.Bottom Line, go see this movie, it really is this good.",10,2,5,17 July 2007

300," One of the Greatest Film ever Made......Seriuously
","I had to wait a week after opening day to go see this movie in theaters, and i must say, it was sooo worth the wait, i left the theater in a great mood, i had just seen the greatest film of our time.The look of the film is fantastic, looks kinda like the comic book, the color is so stupendous.The action and fight scenes are by far the best scenes of the movie, amazing, it was brutal and showed what the spartans had to do for freedom.Plot- Keeps you into the film the whole time, throughout the film you connect and bond with the characters, and at the ending fight scene, when leiondas is the only one left, you feel sad, when he says 'my queen!', your so into the film, you forget your watching it at a theater.My advice, GO SEE THIS FILM IN THE THEATERS, seriously you will not regret it, this is truly one of the greatest movies ever created.'300 isn't just a movie, it's the next step in film-making'",10,1,6,16 April 2007
