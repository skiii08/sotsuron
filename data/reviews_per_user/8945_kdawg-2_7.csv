Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cool and Fun Movie
","I have a lot of friends who a year ago would have thought (including me) that star wars is 'the Loser Menace'.When I saw it with my mom (big fan) I was amazed at how cool the graphics were, and how the story gives you a sense of spirituality. Also how cool the sword fights were.When I told my friends it wasn't the big P.O.S. we thought it was, they didn't believe me at all. Somehow I got a few of them to go, and when we walked out that all we could talk about. It isn't a masterpiece, but it sure is a great movie. Going by the fact that it's a Science Fiction film, it should be considered a milestone in film making.",Null,0,0,21 July 1999
Aliens," I've been hooked since I was 5
","I can't imagine any other movie i've seen that has influenced me more than Aliens.I saw it when I was 5 and since then I've seen it at least 500 times, actually I'm being modest, i've seen it at least 5000 times. I can't help but love this movie because I literally grew up on it.
Other kids before me grew up with Star Wars, well because my parents didn't care about censorship, Aliens is stuck in my head forever as my first favorite movie.Now days Bill Paxton is becoming a huge actor and I'm cheering for him all the way, I cna with ease tell people 'I liked him before he was him'",Null,0,0,21 July 1999
Man on the Moon," People paid money for this?
","I had no idea who Andy Kaufman was before this film was made and I always just assumed from what everyone on TV said about him he was funny. Until I saw this. I don't know if it's a good or bad thing to have stayed and waited through that pitch black nothingness at the beginning of the film. I don't know why those college students even laughed at his taxi impression. I don't see what's so funny about wrestling with women. I don't see what's so funny about going on Lettermen and staging a punch just to get a reaction. I don't understand Andy Kaufman, so sue me. I didn't think this was funny at all or anything he ever did. Who cares about his antics and tricks, none of it was funny or entertaining. What is funny is anything idiotic from South Park and Beavis and Butt-Head to anything brilliant like Dr. Strangelove or Blazing Saddles. Andy Kaufman is very original, but so are Koala Bears, they're just not funny or entertaining.",Null,0,0,16 June 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," Not for the simple minded
","I first saw this movie about a year ago. It is really one of the all time classics of human history. I can't stand to spend time trying to even wonder why someone wouldn't like it unless they have the brain capacity of a plunger.Believe me when I say that if you think Varsity Blues is a classic, Lawrence of Arabia will blow your mind with big words like 'The'.Otherwise I think this movie is one of the better achievements made in the century.",10,1,4,21 July 1999
The Green Mile," Tom Hanks came - that close to pleasing the sleeze, again
","This movie was the definate movie of the year. American Beauty was not beautiful at all, it was sickening and very average. If a movie kills the main character, that doesn't mean it should win the oscar. The Green Mile deserved it. What morals are we telling film makers by saying that a pot smoker going through a mid-life crisis who gets shot, is a better story than this?
Last year the same thing happened, they favored Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan. What do all the veterans feel like when finally a movie comes along and succeeds in getting as close to what really happened, the horror of it all, and they favor a foreign love story over the re-telling of what their grandparents went through to this new generation.
Tom Hanks almost won best actor 2 years in a row again. Almost",Null,0,0,20 June 2000
Platoon," One of my top 10 of all time
","I would honestly have to say there aren't many movies that surpass platoon. It's one of my all time favorites.Although it can't be compared in any way other than it's being a war film, to 'saving Private Ryan'. World War II and Vietnam are 2 exactly opposite wars, and because they're nothing alike, the movies can't be compared to one another, the people acted different, the soldiers weren't the same breed, and the mentality of everyone was different.Sometimes people forget that movies are based on reality, not fantasy.",10,1,1,21 July 1999
Gladiator," Definate oscar contender for art direction, effects
","This movie had some of the best visuals I have ever seen. I can only compare it to last years Star Wars or Matrix. It also has cinematography reminicent of Thin Red Line, which adds to a fantastic picture. One of the two problems I had with this movie, is that it seemed to attract a large audience of professional wrestling fans. I happen to think that anyone who comprehensively watches wrestling has the attention span of a 6 year old. So it felt like there were a bunch of 6 year olds staying up later than they should be to watch this movie, when I was there. Screaming 'Can you smell what the rock is cooking' when the fight scenes are happening and 'BORING' when they stop and talk. The other problem, is that it for some reason doesn't feel like a masterpiece. At the end, Phoenix didn't seem to be sooooo evil as he was hyped to be throughout the movie. He was just a misunderstood problem child who got mad at daddie for embracing someone better then him. He could have been more powerful, and evil, there are ways.",8,0,0,6 May 2000
