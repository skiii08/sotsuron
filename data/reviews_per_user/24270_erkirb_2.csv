Scarface," Certainly not a masterpiece
",I agree the film is a bit overrated. The script is not very strong and realistic. I'm sure criminal world is not that simple as it's pictured in this movie. Pacino tends to overplay his role and at times it's just merely funny when he tries to be real serious. I don't think the film is too long put there could be more content to fill the time. Still even though it's not a classic Scarface is strong enough to give it at least a try.,7,0,0,14 August 2000
The Mummy Returns," Sad waste of time and money
","I usually try to find something positive in a movie but the complete lack of tension in acting and script do not leave much room for that in this case. Even the huge load of effects (in fact they might as well have shot the whole movie in a studio) fail to make impression when the quality starts to decline badly towards the end. The script is so full of clichés that one can shut his eyes in the middle of the film and be sure he won't miss one detail. I think this movie gives a new meaning to those fine Van Damme films that we all love' so much. I can understand the financial arguments behind The Mummy Returns', where there's some easy cash lying around you better grab it, but a major studio should also keep in mind mental health of the poor viewer who might have to sit it through.I propose a minute of silence in memory of those $98m that made the Mummy return",5,0,0,14 June 2001
