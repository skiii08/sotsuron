Blade Runner 2049," Really long movie with slow pace and stunning cinematography
","After having seen this movie for almost 3 hours, I feel the urge to write a very quick review:Pros: - Stunning Cinematography - Beautful shots of an interesting and futuristic looking world - Not a remake of the first Blade Runner, but has its own story - claustrophobic Cyberpunk feeling and atmosphere is done well.Cons: - disappointing soundtrack, barely any melodies, more like futuristic electronic whale sounds. - Super slow pacing. Like way too slow. This needs a re-cut, to reduce the unnecessarily long shots of nothing happening. - Totally wrong trailer, suggesting this was an action movie, when actual action scenes in the movie are maybe around 20-30% only.Still 7/10, but only because of the visuals. A little different soundtrack and little fast cuts from time to time would make this an 8/9 out of 10 for me.",7,2,5,7 November 2017
Passengers," The trailer creates a wrong idea what the movie is about
","First off the movie itself is decent. Acting, CGI, sound effects, ideas are all good and fun to watch.But this movie also has a big problem: It is not what the trailer points out to.After the trailer I thought there would be some kind of social experiment, aliens attack, a conspiracy or whatsoever going on. When the real plot can be put into one sentence: 'During a 120 year journey to another planet a ship gets damaged by a meteorite and wakes up 1 unlucky guy because of a malfunction (who luckily is a mechanic) to repair the ship and prevent the destruction of the ship containing over 5000 people on board - the End.' Yeah well of course there is this romantic component with Jlaw and it is fun to watch, but I would have liked to know up in front that this movie is a romantic drama. A good one yes, but still why create false hopes with the trailer? And you burn Andy Garcia for 5 seconds screen time?? Is this a joke? There was so much more potential, and so much more interesting things that could've been told. But instead this movie wants to make us think about the questions: What is a good life? What is so important about other people? What happens if we are truly lonely? Would we make ourselves feel better, by destroying other peoples lives? Or is this all interpretation and POV?conclusion: wrong trailer / still a decent movie.",7,1,2,14 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Most expensive trailer ever produced
","Disney/Lucasfilm and this whole sequel trilogy feels like the 'cool kid' back in school: Expensive brand clothes, big mouth telling phrases and experiences from other people, but nothing own to back it up and when you point it out it gets insecure and starts insulting you...Just write an overarching story next time and have a vision. There are enough talented screenwriters, that are also Star Wars fans. They might not follow your useless Disney corporate movie checklist with wokeness and stuff like that, but they will write you an amazing story that the Fnas will love and will give you at least 3 times more revenue considering merchandise and stuff.Really its up to you. Star Wars is a huge universe, with still thousands of stories left to tell. Whether or not the fans will care, depends on how you operate from now on. Whoever greenlighted any scripts from the new trilogy should go, they have no idea about good storytelling or the brand and the fandom of Star Wars at all. What you have given us is just a soup with endless ingredients piled up into a big giant mess. Just great ingridients on their own does not make a great meal! Get a chefcook that knows how to handle Star Wars please. It is SOOOO easy honestly im dumbfounded how you could have screwed this up so badly. This is a failure of historic proportions.
Not talking about this movie which is kinda okay on its own, I am talking about the new Disney trilogy which is a horrible mess of destroying iconic childhood heroes and everything they've achieved. Adding tons of plotholes, Deus Ex Machina, conveniences and SJW pandering, the only thing that keeps you watching might be the decent visuals and sound. But you can have that in any major action movie nowadays, so that's really not a big deal anymore.
Rogue One and Mandalorian are great, so whoever did those, just hand them the leadership if you really cannot find anyone else.",5,1,1,25 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This movie is so hard to judge, feels like different writers all wanted to add their bit.
","This movie COULD have been the best Star Wars yet. There were so many fantastic things in this movie. For example: The sounddesign, the score, the digital effects, the acting, the worlds and visuals, some really amazing ideas of what is happening and how it is visualized, also some of the jokes are really fun.HOWEVER, all of the above mentioned aspects of a movie are just used to carry the story. And this is one of the main problems in this movie. The Story is simply not that good. It has its twists and interesting ideas. Yet it comes with a huge pile of logic, physical and plot holes. I will list some of those holes later, first I want to know, how can such a hiqh quality movie production such as Disney deliver this kind of amateurish fails?1. It's Star Wars, add enough good visuals and comic reliefs and the people will see it anyway, afterall its all about the money. (Maybe think about long-term damage too Disney!)
2. It's a different director and writer and they sure as hell didn't cooperate. It almost feels like Rian Johnson doesn't like JJ Abrams himself or his story and negated many points, only so now JJ can fix the broken story. Well good luck with that JJ, I'm glad im not in your skin right now.Now to the amateurish fails: the many many holes. I will sort them, because there are so many:1. Logical/Physical holes<ul><li>In the beginning Poe attacks a Dreadnaught on his own. He shoots down all the turrets, flies through them ignoring space debris. 4 Other Star Destroyers are surrounding that Dreadnought and are not helping, not sending Tie Fighters or anything to help. Even after the super slow Bombers show up, they are not helping.</li></ul><ul><li>The resistance sends Bombers that drop bombs.. in space. Zero gravity, yet they fall, they are not shot, nor do they have any impulse. Also magnetic wouldn't work. Also the pilot is lying there without a mask next to an open bomb shaft. Okay.</li></ul><ul><li>Leia is on the bridge that is completely blown up, yet she stays unharmed and is catapulted into space. She seems dead, but after a time in ice cold space she awakes and flies back to the ship. Okay I get it, she can use the force, but how can she survive space? How could she have used the force while being unconscious?</li></ul><ul><li>Furthermore she flies to the door and they open it... You know space? Everyone would get sucked out immediately. But yea i guess that's Disney magic.</li></ul><ul><li>The Supremacy shoots Laser and they bend like artillery fire. That's not how Laser works. Tell me its anything else, but on the official Star Wars site I don't read any other armament that would suit bending/falling fire shots (It looks cool I get it.)</li></ul><ul><li>Finn decides to sacrifice himself, yet for some reason Rose, who was way behind can speed up so fast to interrupt him and crash into him. And they both survive and are NOT shot by the first order all the way back. I like what Rose says: Dont fight what you hate, rescue what you love. This is a good message, however Finn was trying to rescue the people he loves by destroying that ram.</li></ul>
2. Plot holes <ul><li>The First order explains that they have to follow the resistance instead of shooting it because, they are not fast enough. How about sending out all Tie Fighters and Bombers and end it? Explanation of Hux: We cannot give assistant fire. Sure hundreds of Fighters and Bombers need assisstance vs. that little resistance fleet. Also the supremacy is superiour in every way, so they could just let the other destroyers jump into hyperspace and jump back in front of the resistance, easy win.</li></ul><ul><li>It is not very conveniently explained why Luke has become such a different emo-char. I get it he looked into the dark side in Kylo and was seduced to kill him for a second. Boohoo big deal, I cannot believe that this changes him in such a fundamental way.</li></ul><ul><li>If Luke doesn't want to be found, why did he mark his position on a map?</li></ul><ul><li>If supreme Leader Snoke connects the MIND of Kylo and Rey, why does Kylo have physical water on him after meeting Rey?</li></ul><ul><li>The dark cave where Rey goes into has NOTHING to offer. its just a technical experiment that adds nothing to the story or her character. What a dissapointing wasted scene.</li></ul><ul><li>Holdo doesn't tell Poe (which was one of the most trustworthy resistance members) her plan to evacuate the ship, because reasons?</li></ul><ul><li>Finn and Rose don't tell Holdo how the First order can track them, because? (Could be done via comlink when they were already on their mission to Canto bight)</li></ul><ul><li>Why was the Mastercodehacker with the red flower even introduced if he doesn't play any role in the movie? Why was there another masterhacker randomly in the same cell as Rose and Finn were put into? Why did he have a device to unlock the cells, why did he wait to that point to use it? Why are you thrown into prison for landing on the beach? Why do we need a Harry Potter looking stampede scene to free some random animals, that will get caught back anyway? This whole chase scene through the city is embarassing and pointless.</li></ul><ul><li>Why can force ghost Yoda ignite lightning in the real physical world?</li></ul><ul><li>I guess BB-9e scanned Finn, Rose and DJ, but it wasn't shown clearly enough.</li></ul><ul><li>Snoke can sense every thought in Kylo, yet he cannot sense, a danger nearby? Snoke has been built up by JJ in the last movie and shows his power this movie and later is just killed in such an unspectacular way, you wonder if this is a parody. If Snoke is still alive and it was a trick I am okay with that scene. If he is really dead it simply doesn't add up.</li></ul><ul><li>Snoke has pushed the conflict within Kylo, he helps Rey, doesn't shoot his mother, he kills Snoke and the red guards yet immediately afterwards he turns superevil, for scriptreasons. The only possible satisfying explanation would be, that Snoke is dead, thus his inner conflict is gone. But Snoke also connected Reys and Kylos mind and that is still in place in the end of the movie. So either Snoke is still alive, which makes Kylos character development unreasonable, or he is dead, which makes the lasting connection between Kylo and Rey not working. :/</li></ul><ul><li>Captain Phasma is immune to Laser, yet she still powers down the Shield of Starkillerbase in Ep 7. Captain Phasma is such a wasted Character in every possible way. Gwendoline Christie is such a talent and they put a mask on her and let her do stupid pointless things, just so they can write her name in the credits. What an amateurish shortsighted behaviour of Disney, its embarassing.</li></ul><ul><li>Holdo flies the Flagship into the supremacy, luckily all or most of the surrounding Star destroyers are also destroyed, how convenient. But she waits with that action until mostly all of the resistance transporters have been shot. Holdo could have been an interesting character that replaces Leia, but they wasted her on the first moment possible. Why not let Admiral Ackbar do that action? He was a legacy char that had to go, but wouldn't that have been a good way of doing it? Sigh. Btw. with that action Holdo could have killed Finn, Rose, DJ, Phasma, Kylo, Rey. But luckily its Disney so the main characters are untouchable Yaaay. Except for legacy Chars, they have to go.</li></ul><ul><li>They flee to Crait, only to leave the door open until the First order arrives and starts shooting. I get it Rose and Finn, must have gotten inside first.</li></ul><ul><li>Kylo not noticing that Luke is a force projection.</li></ul><ul><li>Rey has basically no human flaws. She is good at everything, without training. Just a little scratches from fighting with that lightsabre, because she was used to using a staff, would have been realistic and satisfying. But this attitude just makes her character so uncompelling. She needs any kind of flaw or struggle other than Kylo probably lying about her parents. I simply cannot feel for her, she is too good and perfect in every way. How can we humans identify with such a Mary 'wonderwoman' Sue?</li></ul>
I am sure I would notice many more mistakes if I tried to, but I don't want to. This movie COULD have been amazing. I don't understand how those plot and logic/physical holes can surpass into a final product of this quality standart. If Disney is about to change one thing, it is the story writing. Give the authors more time, develope the characters and their decisions logically.Storywise I can come up with a more interesting story in 5 minutes. Luke is teaching new jedis at a jedi temple. Kylo is still one of them. Phasma, Hux and Snoke are trying to find that location. Finn flees and still finds Rey. Together with Han they escape and Han knows where Luke is. But Phasma had Finn tracked so the Order shows up at the Jedi temple and Snoke twists Kylos mind to the dark site. Luke, Rey, Finn and Han can flee, also with some other Jedi pupils. Snoke collects Kylo and some other pupils and forms the knight of ren. In the second movie the resistance flees from snoke and supremacy. knights of ren rain terror and we have some lightsaber and force duels. In the last movie they have the starkiller base and Luke and Rey fight Kylo and Snoke in a quadrabattle with lightsabers and the force, after Luke and Rey managed to defeat the remaining knights of ren. Luke dies to save Rey and kills Snoke. Rey kills Kylo but uses the dark side of the force to do it. In the end we don't know what side Rey will choose. Its very vague I know. But is a 5 minute idea, that in my opinion is already more interesting that what we got here with Ep7 and 8. :(Maybe Episode 9 can fix some of those plotholes or unsatisfying loose story arcs. Good luck JJ Abrams with Ep9, you are looking at basically nothing left and have to create something new. But its the last movie of a trilogy, I have no idea how you want to do that.",5,1,2,21 December 2017
