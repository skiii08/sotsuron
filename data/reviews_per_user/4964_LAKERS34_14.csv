The Ring," I Tried So Hard But I Just Didn't Get It!
","Geez I wanted to like this movie...I rented it so my wife and I could get a good scare in bed... We began to watch and got through roughly half of it before one of our kids woke up and we had to hit the STOP button. Up to this point, the movie seemed to click along...Production was slick, acting/direction were well done, and the story seemed to be going somewhere...we went to bed without finishing... The next evening, my wife and I licked our chops in anticipation of the last 1/2...Our Heroine made it to the source of the terror and then...EVERYTHING started to fall apart! By the time the movie ended, my wife and I were clueless and angry! Someone drop me an email and explain what happened...I can't find a reason other than the Hollywood clichÃ© that the Horror Film has to grab you and shake you at the end and leave you with a question...The problem here was - We had too many darn questions!!!The Ring involves a supernatural videotape that will kill anyone who watches it in 7 days...The video is strange...paranormal; time code on it doesn't track and attempts to decipher it by our heroine leave more questions than answers...After you watch the tape, you get a creepy phone call telling you 'SEVEN DAYS'... Our heroine Watts watches the tape after a relative's daughter dies after also seeing it...Watts' clock starts ticking. Since she's a darn good investigative reporter, she uses her time left to research the video's origins to try to find an escape... It's a neat premise but the story ultimately goes in the wrong direction, trying find pragmatic answers to the how and why. In doing this, too much that is abnormal (and there's a lot of it) is left hanging...and of course, we get the contrived 'ending within an ending' that's been done a million times. We were hoping for so much more! Oh well...",4,4,9,9 March 2005
United 93," Greengrass Pulls It Off - Powerful Historical Drama
","OK, there has been plenty of speculation and opinion and probably a lot of comments written here by folks who haven't even seen the film yet..Yes, it premiered here last night and I had to go see... I found it is a powerful re-enactment that doesn't dwell on much or on any particular character... It is faithful to the time-line and the events of 9-11-01, even if some of what takes places on board the flight in the film does so out of speculation... What else can a film-maker do? Greengrass, who has done excellent work with the Jason Bourne thriller 'The Bourne Supremacy', is the right man for the job here. He is smart enough to know NOT to tinker too much with history; to NOT cast this film with 'big stars'; to not cause too many distractions as the film moves along.What can I say? We all know what the outcome is. We all have our own ideas about what took place on board United 93. We all remember 9-11-01 like it was yesterday. This film honors those on the doomed flight for what we all have pretty much accepted as fact: The passengers, or victims themselves caused the mission to fail. The simplicity of the director's style, coupled with edgy, subtle performances throughout, will cause you to again stop and think about 9-11-01, most likely for a long time after you see this film. Maybe a lot of us don't want to keep doing that. Nevertheless, despite the fact that there's a buck to be made here, this work fulfills the idea that some of the stories of 9-11 can and need to be told on the big screen... It is powerful, painful, and prideful at the same time. Bring Kleenex.",9,13,29,29 April 2006
Constantine," Sorry...I liked it...
","This is a fable...it's not supposed to be so rooted in reality that we scoff at the implausibilities and the plot holes... We're not watching it to say 'look at how that happened' or 'why is it all happening here in L.A. when we have these worldwide problems' or...whatever... It has to happen somewhere; either you buy off on the fable and get into the story or you flush it...While not being Catholic, through theological edification I was able to make sense of storyline, ironies, metaphors, etc... I liked Reaves' character and again, it's a matter of preference - love or hate - but he played Constantine's miserable demon-cop just right - Reaves continues to find rolls suited to his particular, dark style. Special effects were great, and I give the film kudos for not diving in and becoming an effects extravaganza...it remains online to the story and where we're going... Weisz as heroine and Peter Stormare as Lucifer himself were well-cast. What can I say? It was great diversion and a fun DVD to watch. Check it out!",8,115,137,25 July 2005
Crash," Inspires a Strong Reaction In All of Us
","I saw this film months ago and am now compelled to throw in my two cents after its Best Picture win at the '05 Oscars. There seems to be a LOT of negative buzz at this picture's win...a lot of criticism... Oh well...What people seem to have a problem with here is that all of these characters give voice to what many of us supposedly only THINK...Good Heavens, we'd never actually SPEAK the racist remarks so prevalent throughout this film would we?. But this IS in fact a film...It IS a vehicle where characters can in fact become representative and 'iconistic'...Matt Dillon's cop, The Persian store-owner, the D.A.'s wife and so on...these are all representative of larger bases-of many many people in our diverse set of cultures. The film gives voice to many fears and frustrations in our thoughts that drive societies in negative ways. When this is accepted, then Crash's writing becomes brilliant. The story clicks and moves, with many surprising tie-ins and amazing twists and at least one tear-jerk scene involving a small child. Nothing is what it seems, yet much of what we see on the surface is seemingly common-place. The ensemble cast is directed masterfully; the acting is strong - the stories all stand on their own. This is in fact a passionate work with much more to say than just 'Racism is hugely present in American Society.' As a 20 year veteran of Law Enforcement in Los Angeles, I was moved by and could relate to the many complexities in this film! Congratulations on the Best Picture Oscar!",9,2,10,6 March 2006
Batman Begins," Wow!
","This is just a throwaway to add to the list, but this film was so much fun and so well done that I just had to add something... Having 2 kids, a wife, a house in the 'burbs, and being the only working one (outside anyway), means missing a lot of films until DVD release...Nevertheless,I was so impressed with the scope and story of this film! In the style of the Spiderman series, Batman Begins starts BEFORE the beginning and chronicles the evolvement of the whole sha-bang, and boy, what an evolvement! Christian Bale, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Ilam Neeson, et. all are finely cast, and the direction, story, and appearance of this film are all right on! The care taken in the story to tie so much so neatly together is evident; any small reference at the start of the film could have major implications by the end... It's a wild, complicated plot, but hey, this is based on a comic strip and it ALL works! GREAT Film-making! If you are so bored that you actually read this review, I hope you had or have as much fun watching Batman Begins as I did!",10,2,4,3 November 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Best World War II Film Ever Made
","This film is actually a simple tale told through the mind of the man who was saved...Private Ryan... There's been very little attention focused on the opening and ending sequences, where we see Ryan as an elder, complete with his family. <minor spoilers> We know from the opening that his coming back to Normandy is incredibly significant; it's in his walk and in his eyes... As he kneels down on the battlefield cemetery his mind is far, far away...After the tale is told, the ending is as touching as anything I've ever seen in the movies...We get the feeling his journey (here and in life) is now complete; he's paid homage to those who fought and died for him (and for all of us).  Very Simple.  You can talk all you want about the historical specifics and/or inaccuracies this film might or might not contain; to me they are irrelevant:  The bigger picture is not in dispute - WWII, the war in Europe, the fight against Hitler, the allied invasion of France, and D-Day were all defining moments of the 20th Century that brought out the worst (and best) mankind has ever had to offer. 
The main body of the film is incredible.  Difficult to watch and just as hard to look away from, the opening and ending battlefield sequences set new standards for action-cinematography.  To those who have criticized other portions of the film as boring, or over-the-top sentimentality, I think Spielberg's attempts to humanize his main characters are a great success; unlike BLACKHAWK DOWN, the story takes the time to let us get to know each soldier - I WANTED to know who they were and as each <spoiler> begins to get 'picked off' as the story evolves, you feel yourself mourning the thousands of soldiers each represents.  Tom Hanks is wonderful as the Captain in charge of saving Private Ryan...his performance is understated to perfection.  Tom Sizemore, Ed Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, Matt Damon, Barry Pepper, and Jeremy Davies are all believable and finely cast in their respective roles...This film takes the time to flush out its characters.  In the end, when all decide that saving Private Ryan is the right thing to do and  <<spoiler>> most end up paying with their lives, I was struck with what a great sense of appreciation I felt for their accomplishment; with what it meant for Private Ryan, and again, what it meant for all of us.  My father died in 1966 as a direct result of an injury he sustained in WWII (B-24 pilot who was shot down in 1943 over Germany, sustained severe head injury, lost 10 of his crew, was held as POW for almost a year before escaping, Silver Star recipient, died of brain hemorrhage 23 years later). I know this film would have made him proud.",Null,2,3,4 June 2004
Django Unchained," Passionate Filmmaker Creates More Passion!
","Another amazing piece of work from Tarantino... Every single performance was dead-on; To me, the use of the N-word was anything but gratuitous; This piece of our vocabulary had its place in history during that time and for another hundred years after... In making this film, Tarantino creates a set piece with deeper and darker connotations as they relate to parts of our history as a country and slavery in general. He does this while making a wildly entertaining, captivating piece of work. So many well-known, great actors here! If DiCaprio isn't considered for an Oscar, something is wrong in Hollywood... Samuel Jackson was incredible also as was Christoph Waltz - You could go on and on. I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this film because it was going to be long and sometimes Quentin can be a little over the top - In this case, I was absolutely dazzled. If you are thinking about seeing it, quit thinking and go!Lastly, I think just about every character who spoke the N-word ended up dead anyway...",10,2,10,29 December 2012
World Trade Center," Straightforward Approach Works for Stone
","There will of course inevitably be films made about 9-11 and they will no doubt take many different approaches in telling their stories. This film, the second major effort at depicting the 9-11 attacks, approaches the story head-on, literally from Ground Zero, from the viewpoint of some of those most directly involved in the incident: Rescue Workers. The fact that this film was directed by Oliver Stone was/is a surprise. The film is benign in the sense that it does not postulate about what happened that day and why, which is not your typical Stone movie. Instead, it takes its time telling an intimate story about a group of Rescue Workers caught up in the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and their battle to survive/escape an unimaginable hell.The film works because Stone takes the time to flush out his characters; we genuinely care about these people and feel their emotions as things turned from bad to worse that day. Cage, Bello, Pena, et.al. play their roles effectively, making us aware that 9-11 affected 'ordinary people' and caused them to perform in an extraordinary way.All in all, an excellent film. While it is big-budgeted and full of big names, it simply tells one of MANY stories to be told on that day effectively and faithfully. As with United 93, I would recommend bringing Kleenex.",9,100,187,11 August 2006
Black Hawk Down," Men In Battle (With No Frills)
","Someone previously wrote that this film focuses on 'as much action as possible' at the expense of story and character development...I think it's obvious the filmmakers made a conscious decision to take this path...The action IS the story...character development is relegated to supporting the ACTION. It's important to note that the action in this film makes us stop, think, and consider...it's anything but gratuitous.There is a moment in the film when an unknown soldier, just prior to leaving the U.S. base for Mogadishu and the epic battle to follow, makes a last-ditch call to his wife. The film cuts to the soldier's residence stateside, where the silhouette of a woman moves to answer the phone as the answering machine clicks on. The brief shot of the home reveals comfort and the presence of children. The soldier leaves a brief message and he's off...just as the wife picks up the phone. We all know what will happen to this soldier... A simple yet memorable scene that tells us in broad strokes who these men are and what they are risking for Country. In another scene, Tom Sizemore (a U.S. Colonel) and his men are being cut to pieces. An RPG rips through one of the Colonel's convoy trucks, blowing a man in half. The Colonel unflinchingly walks over and takes the man's hand and looks into his eyes as he breathes his last amidst gunfire and explosions...A chilling moment, masterfully shot and anything but gratuitous! The whole film takes this path...The action sequences in this film are incredible and match the standard set by 'Private Ryan' and Spielberg. Ridley Scott has been considered part of the elite for many years and this film cements that reputation. Difficult to watch yet hard to look away from, Black Hawk Down proves timeless in its message and in its method...As we slowly lose control of the Middle East in the 21st Century, there will undoubtedly be new films that try to convey the same message...Men caught up in hells not of their choosing doing the best they can; 'It's all about the man next to you'9 out of 10!",10,2,4,13 May 2004
War of the Worlds," This is a Good Remake...See it for what is is
","My Lord...We go out of our way to hate Tom Cruise because he's fallen in love with a younger, attractive, successful actress and lets the world know about it... We disagree with his religious principals and think he's a nut... We're jealous because he's 40 something, wealthy, and on top of the world... So let's vote this film Worst of 2005...I don't think so...This is an exciting, scary, action-packed film... Cruise's performance as a dead-beat dad who gets it together was not over the top; had he made this film 10 or 15 years ago it no doubt would have been received very differently. This is Science-Fiction/Horror/Fantasy at its best and an original spin on classic material. Orson Welles would have been proud of this effort; Every important point in his original radio play in 1938 is addressed here and a truly stark film showing Man at the mercy of Martians is what we have. Excellent special effects also! Bravo! I suppose Cruise's upcoming Mission Impossible III will be voted Worst of 2006...",8,32,44,6 March 2006
Hitch," Surefire Entertainment
","Surprisingly cute, well-done, very funny film. Will Smith, Kevin James, Eva Mendes, and especially Amber Valletta give excellent performances and bring even more to the written material. Valletta's character, in a supporting role, is the key here in my mind... She brings a warmth and believability to the stereotyped 'Snobby Rich B*itch' that helps bring things to a comic and almost believable conclusion... Will Smith and Mendes provide substance to the main roles, and their tension, conflict, and attraction is alive and takes us in while Smith and Kevin James provide the majority of comic relief...My wife and I had a great time watching and left the theater quite satisfied - there's no doubt this is THE date movie of 2005.",8,1,3,15 March 2005
Ray," By the Book, But It's a Good Book
","RAY is pretty much Hollywood Formula; The story of one man's struggle and ultimate success... There are the cursory scenes showing the struggles, temptations, successes, and heartbreaks. What makes this film stand out above it all are the performances, and the fact that Ray Charles Robinson's story, no matter how formulaic, is pretty dog-gone interesting...Jamie Foxx turns in one of the great performances of this or any year - His Ray is real in the sense that we just accept the fact that yes, we are watching Ray Charles. This is acting at its best. Those in supporting roles are equally strong - conveying all the emotion, support, and deceit that surrounded a man like Ray. The key components of Ray's childhood, which affect his choices, both good and bad as a man, are told hauntingly through flashback; the Florida landscape looks beautiful through the eye of the lens (Great cinematography!)...The screenplay is faithful to RAY's life; there is no sugarcoating - RAY looks unflinchingly in the mirror and makes no apologies. My wife was not eager to see Ray...When I pulled the DVD and fired it up in our room, her first reaction was 'Ahh Gee...do we have to?' She got up and did a few things while the opening sequence rolled with credits. When she came back in, I put the film to the beginning and told her, 'If you're not interested by the time the opening credits end, we'll turn it off.' Needless to say, we both sat through the whole thing riveted, with my wife saying Ray is now one of her favorites... Strongly Recommended!",8,13,15,15 April 2005
The Soloist," Uplifting: Finding a Golden Needle in the Haystack of Urban Blight
","First off, I should say that I am personally familiar with this story, having worked in downtown L.A. for the last 19 years and seeing Mr Ayers and his cello many a time around 3rd and Hill Sts. I've also read Lopez's columns in the Times for years and followed this one with interest and satisfaction. Making a film about a tale like this restores my belief in Hollywood beyond the mindless bunk it churns out year after year.Downey Jr and Foxx play a newspaper columnist and homeless man who come together in a most unusual way. Downey is a newspaper columnist looking for something original and interesting to write about. He finds it when he sees Foxx beautifully playing battered stringed instruments along 3rd street in downtown L.A. Foxx has been there for years but on this day grabs the eye of the columnist because the columnist himself is experiencing hardship and doubt related to his own position. He begins to write about this talented but troubled man who fills the stinky air around him with harmony. They become friends but keep in mind this is not fiction. The friendship hits many bumps that continue to this day. Nathaniel Ayers (Foxx's character) may be a brilliant, educated musician, but he suffers from bouts of schizophrenia that manifest at any time. Downey's character accepts this as it adds more intrigue to his columns. Then he accepts it on a personal level. Their friendship ultimately becomes real and meaningful. You sense that Downey's character needs the friendship even more than Foxx's homeless man does. In the end, Downey's Lopez can see the positive effect his work has brought to the plight of the homeless, yet he wonders personally how much better he has made Nathaniel...? His reflections make us think also.Downey Jr and Foxx play their characters to near perfection and the film masterfully takes its time in developing the relationship between the two. Great to see director Joe Wright telling a contemporary tale just as effectively as he has in previous works. The film makes us wonder how many other Nathaniel Ayers are lurking out there on the streets? Life being what it is, of course we will never know. The beauty of the film is that is shows what can happen when just one Nathaniel Ayers is found after being lost for so many years. There's no sugarcoating; Ayers doesn't magically get better and rejoin mainstream society. Instead, the mainstream accepts him for what he is and what he offers and begins integrating him as best it can. This film will certainly pop up at award time next year.",10,141,176,23 April 2009
The Island," Best of the Bay Films (I know, that's not saying much)
","I had ignored this DVD on the shelf for several months, not even remembering the trailers when they appeared prior to the film's theatrical release. I knew it cost $125 million to make and produced a paltry sum in theaters. When I finally grabbed it off the shelf and popped it in the player, however, I found a film as enjoyable as Bay's first blockbuster, The Rock.The premise of the film is fascinating enough, and Bay's rapid-fire direction and $125,000,000 budget don't disappoint. Special effects and action sequences are up to par, and we genuinely sympathize with the plight of the two main leads. Ewan Macgregor and Scarlett Johannson play their roles simplistically (and effectively), although Macgregor's more serious turn towards the end (ensuring both's survival) is a stretch. Djimon Hounsou's turn at the end, while bizarre, makes sense, and Sean Bean and Steve Buscemi add substance and style to villain and ally along the way. Without giving it all away, The Island is definitely a top-tier rental. Be pleasantly surprised!",8,1,2,7 August 2006
