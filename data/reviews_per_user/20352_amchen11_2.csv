Deja Vu," The portrayal of Claire is exploitative and sexist *spoilers*
","This film was visually UGLY. The grating music and washed out colours are familiar for those who have seen 'Man On Fire', but were totally wrong for this movie.The characters are two dimensional. We never really know what Denzel's character is like. We just know that he is lonely and smart, and are told over and over again how selfless and righteous a hero he is.Claire is beautiful, don't you forget that. Every moment she is on screen her beauty, frailty, loneliness and helplessness is rammed down the audience's throat. We really never get past her beauty and object of Denzel's heroic acts. The voyeuristic nature of the machine gives the director a convenience excuse to present Claire on screen in various states of seduction: hanging around in her bra; getting dressed; taking showers. Her worthiness as a human being to be rescued from a terrible fate is COMPLETELY dependent on her beauty and as an object of desire to the male hero.The incredible sexism and the recycled feel of the time-travel ideas in this film made me walk out with disrespect for the director and writers. Well, it's Tony Scott, so one should never expect subtlety anyway. The 3 points are for Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood and Jim Caviezel.",Null,1,3,1 December 2006
The Fountain," Beautiful Visually but Mixed Feelings
","The six stars are for its imagery.Found a_lester_t (1 December 06) and tyler_schuett's (28 November 06) reviews to be very much on the mark as to the meaning and description of this film. The story takes place within one instant, rather than 1000 years. And the futuristic Tom is actually all in Present Day Tom's head, as is the 16th Century Tom.Main Problem with this film: With all the 'spirituality' in mass media today, it's really hard to feel moved by The Fountain. That path towards enlightenment, confrontation, acceptance with death - it's really pretty much a clich√© in cinema, in writing, in the arts. So the problem isn't the quality of the 'message' here, but its wow-factor. There has to be something that supplements this 'message' to make it very special to the viewer. And while the movie is visually absolutely beautiful and original, it just doesn't deliver. It may present itself to be profound, but the viewer might just as well think, well, didn't Deepak Chopra just say the same thing on Oprah the other day? And contrary to what has been said about the film by other reviewers, it is not ambiguous or mysterious with its message. It is all neatly drawn out, albeit with a lot of passion by its maker/s. Having said that, much credit has to go to the set designers/art direction/production people, Hugh Jackman, Rachel Weisz and Ellen Burnstyn and the rest of the cast for great performances. Especially Jackman, who does 'dark and tortured' as well as 'light and frothy' so well!",Null,2,4,3 December 2006
