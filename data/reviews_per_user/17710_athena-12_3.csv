Antz," Woody whines!
","I was totally bored after the first half hour of Woody whining.  I would have been so much happier had the talents of Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone and the others were utilized more.  Technically it was a wonderful film .. but it ended up being way too boring and predictable.  I'd suggest you wait and see it on video.",4,3,6,11 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," May the force be with you!
",This movie is an excellent example of why I pay no attention to professional movie critics.  I loved the movie ... from beginning to end.  The special effects are seamless and the acting is perfect.  George Lucas proves we don't need sex and blood in order to make a good movie!,9,0,0,26 May 1999
Toy Story," A wonderful family movie!
",What a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy!  I can hardly wait for Toy Story 2 to come out!,8,2,3,11 October 1998
