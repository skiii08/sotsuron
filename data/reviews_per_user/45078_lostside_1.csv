The New World," like a dream, a poem, a song...
","It's like a dream, a poem, a song... This movie is about love, real love, and that is why it is sad, it is slow, it has that feeling of something you lost of something confused you can't define, this movie is about love, and what is love if not exactly that? A dream, a cloudy and melancholic sequence of actions, the searching for something you need more than everything else and yet you can't be happy with. Great moments make great movies, and this movie is all about that. It's not for everyone sure, it's a love or hate movie, and that is always a good thing...
