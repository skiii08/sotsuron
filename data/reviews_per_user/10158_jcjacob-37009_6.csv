Casablanca," The GREATEST American Film Ever Made!!!
","Casablanca (1942), Directed by Michael Curtiz, is the film that still remains as a Great American Classic. The Acting (from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman), as well as the Direction, Screen writing, Production, Editing, Cinematography, Musical Score and Art Direction/Set Decoration is all a Masterpiece of Cinematic Quality. There are techniques that Curtiz uses to pull off each and every scene, whether if it be the shadowing of Humphrey in one scene, or the usage of light for another scene with Ingrid. What is really striking about the film is how it holds up. The Filmmakers were in fact making another Hollywood Film, but in a different time.The Second World War broke out. American was uncertain about their future and what was to become of it. Some have said that this film is considered as a propaganda film; which is slightly true with most Hollywood films. the point is that Casablanca is masterful in every aspect. Its' black & White quality is another aspect.Michael Curtiz did a fantastic job with both casting, and art. He uses certain Camera and lighting tricks to get the audiences involved with the moment of each scene. What is interesting is that we don't know this, but critics do. The film has been sighted as a number one pick from critics. It is the film that reached the hearts of hundreds, if not thousands of people throughout the US.",10,1,2,28 March 2017
Citizen Kane," The GREATEST Film of All Time!!!
","Citizen Kane (1941), is the film the made Cinema History. Orson Welles is a Great Actor, but he is also a Very, Very, Very Unique Director. Orson has a very clever eye for detail and framing within his shots. While we as the audience are intrigued by his character, Charles Foster Kane, we are still mind blown by just how well both the Cinematography, Editing, as well as the Art Direction works for us. These elements are hugely important in telling the whole story. The film was not well received back in 1941. It has been attacked by one of the Greatest (if not dangerous) Tycoons of the Media business, William Randolph Hearst. Hearst Accused Welles for copying his life, but this is what Welles wanted for Kane, he did have the Keys to make any film he wanted without studio interference. That all changed when the Film Industry made it harder for Welles to get his films off the ground. Fortunately, Welles was forgiven by the public in the mid 70's. Out of many films that I have seen in the past, Citizen Kane is the film that made me love Black & White Movies. It is a wonder why people never took the film for what it was. One of my top 5 Favorite films!",10,1,4,28 March 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," The GREATEST Epic Ever Made!!!
","Lawrence of Arabia (1962), is possibly the Best Film ever made in the Epic Genre. The film is directed by David Lean (Steven Spielberg's Mentor), who has made another Best Picture and Director win in the 1957 Classic, 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. Lawrence of Arabia stars Peter O'Toole and Alec Guinness. Lean is very unique, especially when it comes down to the cut of a scene, rather than a fade. Lean uses these methods to make the film more engaging instead of putting the audience on hold.One thing that I love about this movie is not just the sand, desert, costumes or camels, but mostly the Cinematography. The Scope of this film is gigantic in every way. The filmmakers used a special anamorphic lens to enhance the scale of the desert, which is breath- taking to the audience. The Scenes that were filmed are all real. David Lean had to wait for the right moment for the weather to hit its' mark.The movie is 3 hrs. long, with an Intermission, but it's worth the watch. Lawrence of Arabia is the kind of film that should be made today. Definitely in my Top 5 Favorite Films List!",10,2,5,28 March 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," The GREATEST Geometric Sci-Fi Film Ever Made!!!
","Stanley Kubrick had absolutely no knowledge of the Science Fiction genre. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) has been called the Grandfather of Sci-Fi films. George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and many others, have considered this film as an inspiration to their careers. The goal for Kubrick was to not only make an experimental film, but to take its genre very seriously (and realistically). Kubrick went beyond the limits with the film's photography and Special Effects.The framing of the movie is both geometrical and symmetrical, to a higher degree. Kubrick creates images that make us as the viewer question its meaning, instead of receiving an answer. 2001 may not be what people expect it to be. I also, struggled to understand its meaning, but the film should be viewed more than once. Kubrick takes us beyond our expectations, into something that is completely unknown.There are some things about this films that I do not fully agree on, but the experience was quite thrilling for me. There are some shots throughout this film that filmmakers are trying to figure out. I for one accept the film as an artistic observation, rather than it being a everyday usual talkie.",10,3,5,29 March 2017
Ben-Hur," The GREATEST Film Ever Made!!!
","William Wyler's Presentation of Ben-Hur (1959) is by far the purest form of entertainment that I have ever seen! The great sea-battle and chariot race is by far what makes this film so epic in both scope and scale. The Acting, Production, Directing, Screen writing, Cinematography, Editing and Art Direction/Set Decoration are incredible. It cleaned up the Awards for a good reason. What makes it even more powerful and unique are the scenes that show Christ, but not his face (and voice neither heard).The movie is not only a Biblical Epic like Cecil B. DeMille's 'The Ten Commandments', but it is perhaps the first time we as an audience, have to observe the film from an artistic perspective, rather than being exposed to the entire message. The film moved me on many levels when I first watched in 2014, with both my Mother and later my Grandmother. Wyler puts us in a position where the film's main concept functions in both ways, both by listening and watching. The relationship between Messala and Judah Ben-Hur is a familiar parallel to the Civil War battles between the North and South, Ben- Hur's slavery at the Galley of Rowers is also similar to that issue with the South back in the time.The Film expresses its' meanings on many different levels, whether if it be on the topics of politics, faith, corruption, and friendship. For a 3 hr. Epic, This movie is worth the time. This is my all-time Number one Favorite Film!",10,3,4,28 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The GREATEST Science Fiction Film Ever Made!!!
","There is no Denying that George Lucas had a unique vision for Science Fiction. Star Wars (1977), is the film that changed the business of Special/Visual Effects. Many Fans consider, 'The Empire Strikes Back' as the Greatest of the Series (which it is), but it is this film that truly stood the test of time. George Lucas was inspired by several classic films including Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece Epic 'Seven Samurai'. Lucas also turned to books like Classic Mythology, Fairy Tales, as well as focusing on topics of Spirituality.The Characters are all understandable to the audience. We have strong feelings for the main characters, even for the films main Antagonist. Lucas uses techniques to help expand his story, as well as the Visual Effects, to greater lengths. Every story has a Hero, and every story has a villain. The Hero has to face constant odds in order to reach his/her goal. This is not the first film that I have seen in the series, but it certainly deserves my top 5 favorite films list. It is probably the only Science Fiction Film that Fans remember most.",10,0,1,28 March 2017
