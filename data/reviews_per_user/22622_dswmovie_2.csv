Mission: Impossible III," Just thought it wasn't good enough!
","In my opinion, Mission Impossible III seems to be a bit good when J. J. Abrams tried to give a fresh setting on the storyboard. That make it look less uninteresting.Unfortunately, when it comes to Tom Cruise, I just cannot say a word. From the beginning of the series, I have already got a sense that he was not the right one for the role of Ethan Hunt.Also there is some points for you to notice: Firstly, the warehouse scene was unbelievable. Even the troop can save Lindsey, maybe she had been killed herself long before the rescue to avoid from further torture.Secondly, being Davian was the most interesting part in the film but it was shown in the wrong way. If we don't notice the disappearance of Ethan Hunt, that may be funnier. It is because audience need a great surprise, not something they could notice so early.Finally, the ending was too good to be true. I never believe Davian would got one question to ask Ethan, for that people always falls into curiosity. And Ethan would be that stubborn at all. The script had to make Ethan to be immortal. That's the last thing I feel unhappy about.The misuse of top playwrights like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jonathan Rhys Meyer give a minus to the whole production.Mostly, I bet the move should be at the right pace. You have to get somewhere to let people stop because it was going to be a 100% action flick.... but when Tom got it controlled, that would never be fulfilled. That's why it failed to up one level.",7,2,4,15 May 2006
The Patriot," It isn't so bad as what the Englishmen said.
","Some say it encouraged Americanism.  I disagree with them because it is about the war that seeks for independence.  It is from the history event that had reviewed in script.  If people go and seek independence, they must have feeling of belonging.  Then, that helps them to grow their intention.Yes, I think Roland is a wrong person to direct THE PATRIOT because he is just a man eligible to make some unreal scientific fiction.  He spoiled the movie, especially when comparing with Mel Gibson, because he tried hard to imitate BRAVE HEART but Roland can't get his soul.  The situation just like what Robert had done on WHAT LIES BENEATH.It gets the point that parents should sometimes let their children do something wrong and then demonstrate them the mistakes (of course, if they try to commit a crime, we should stop them).   Like Gabriel, he is a nice guy that saved the foes...he should knew that.   His kindness led him to this mistake.    He was politically correct because life is indeed precious. Why didn't he go and save these wounded soldiers? He don't see how bad the consequences would be beforehand.  Benjamin never stopped Gabriel because he had done the right thing, but at a wrong moment.And as we always quote, 'like father, like son', it is true.  It is because we all had been young and careless.  Our fathers have been the same.  They also neglect advice and learn from mistakes afterwards.  Yes, parents try their best to protect their kids but sometimes acceptable mistakes should be made to help them to see the real world.Yes, fathers are much considerate because what they decided will probably affect the whole family.However, a young man would bear a greater risk because he could just live on his own, without the responsibilities from his own family (I mean his own marriage).  That's why he could be quick-tempered and childish.Susan is the most remarkable part in the film even if she just appeared only for a few minutes.  That illustrated what a little kid expected from its parents.  They hope to beloved.  Like Susan, she got provoked with Benjamin because he always spent his days in battles, without talking with her. That widened the gap between them.    Fortunately, she finally understood him and broke the barriers.Maybe the history is being rewritten but I think THE PATRIOT was a great family drama, with plenty of human nature that you should not have missed.",Null,0,1,30 August 2000
