Airlift," Excellent, awesome, ultimate movie...
","Ultimate Movie, proud to be Indian... Great Story of success, Excellent hard work of the whole team AIRLIFT. Brilliant acting by Akshay Kumar, and a very sound performance by Nimrat Kaur. Great emotions, feeling like I was there. Quality music, Arijit Singh Sung with his pure heart. Airlift is based on the true incident of India's biggest human evacuation mission during the 1990 Gulf War in which 1.7 lakh Indians were airlifted using 488 flights in just 59 days. Airlift is a tale of heroism, courage, patriotism, and a lot more. And deserves a standing ovation. In all, Airlift is the story of unparalleled courage and unsung heroes. From unknown names in the Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi to people who had their Indianness rearing its head from within just when it was required, Airlift is un-miss-able.",10,4,6,25 January 2016
