Walk the Line," Still good- don't let Ray dampen it for you
","While Ray was a really good movie, this one is almost as good if not as good if only for Joaquin Phoenix's and Reese Witherspoon's performances. Both of them are so electrifying as Johnny Cash and June Carter, the movie would just not be good with other actors playing them. The same can be said of Ray, and while some people are calling Walk the Line 2005's Ray, I really don't think that's true. Ray was sad and melancholy, and more of a full and broad portrait of Ray Charles than Walk the Line is of Johnny Cash. Walk the Line focuses in on his love for Carter and his addictions. Ray covers more of Charles' life while still feeling focused- Walk the Line actually is focused, and each works on its own terms.While the movie wouldn't be the same without Phoenix or Witherspoon, it supports its players well, connecting the different plot points well with each of their songs and allowing a glimpse of the characters past Johnny and June, such as Johnny's wife and father.A good movie- don't miss it because you've been told Ray's better. They're different and each one stands on its own.",8,1,2,4 March 2006
Mission: Impossible III," So Tom is a dork- still see this movie
","I will be the first to tell you that Tom Cruise is turning into a very stupid person. He's hurting the revenue of the movies he's in, whether or not they are good, he's hurting his own public image, he's hurting the public image of his poor young wife, and he's setting the stage for a rocky life for Suri.But Tom Cruise is not this movie. There are many other good things about this movie that have nothing to do with Tom Cruise at all- thank God.Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of them. He makes possibly one of the most realistic antagonists in recent movies. But while remaining realistic, he's still incredibly creepy and intimidating.The plot, too, is quite good. I didn't see the first two, but I didn't need to, and now I don't care if I did or not because this one was satisfying enough. The new impossible mission for Ethan Hunt in this third installment is to retrieve an agent from the possession of Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an arms dealer than keeps out of the public eye, but from this mission stems a far more dangerous one centering around something called the Rabbit's Foot. There's a twist that I saw coming, but I was the only one in my group that did, and it was still a good idea; I admire J.J. Abrams for pulling it off so well.So Tom's in it too, in case you didn't know. He's really not a bad actor, and though he tends to play the same character, he's very good at that character- intense gaze, everyman smile, casual talk. The man plays Tom Cruise very well, and he'll continue to make millions of dollars doing it through a great deal of movies, so I move that we accept that and move past it- because most of those movies are good. Like this one.Forgive it for having Tom in it, and see it despite that flaw.",7,0,1,8 May 2006
The Ring," Not scary enough, but still good
","This movie tells the story of Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a journalist who's niece has died of mysterious causes. Rachel wants to find out what these causes are, so, on a tip from her niece's friends, she seeks out a videotape that is said to kill those who watch it exactly seven days after seeing the tape. Inevitably she watches it and has 7 days to discover its secrets.The Ring is not so much scary as creepy and it spends so much time being creepy that, near the end, I expected it to be scarier, and when it wasn't, I felt let down. The Ring tells a good story and it sets itself up for a big payoff at the end, a climax that should have been very frightening, but in the end, rather than being terrified speechless, I asked my sister, who had already seen it, 'Is that all?' Now don't get me wrong, I liked the movie and I can't say that I wasn't scared for most of it. It's definitely worth seeing for those of us who like to scare the crap out of ourselves, but don't expect to be crapless when this movie is over.",6,0,1,26 July 2006
Finding Neverland," The best movie I've seen all year
","Granted, I haven't seen all of the critically heralded films of 2004, but I believe this would stay my favorite no matter how good the others turn out to be. The magic and wonder of this story captured me from the very first moment that Barrie meets the boys and gives them his dancing bear show.J.M. Barrie (real-life author of Peter Pan (please tell me you've heard of it) played by Johnny Depp in the film) is a playwright whose last play was not up to his usual snuff, most likely due to his lack of inspiration from his life with his wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell). Seeking solitude and ideas, Barrie goes for a walk in the park where me meets Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (a widow, Kate Winslet) and her children, a meeting that sparks many more meetings and imaginative games that inspire the story of Peter Pan.The cinematography is spectacular. Director Marc Forster makes excellent choices with the camera that seem to play along with the screenplay and the score. These three elements work together quite well and turn a simple story into a masterpiece. There are a few times when I felt I was being rushed through certain parts, but the movie makes up for it with it's incredible cast.After seeing Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, I was shocked to see how well he can underplay a character. Depp gives an already poignant character and even more strikingly poignant manner with every inflection, movement, and look. Kate Winslet is equally touching, and while she does not have as much to do as Depp, she matches his talent with brilliant skill of her own. Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman give good turns as Sylvia's mother and the producer of Barrie's play, respectively.I think the player that the critics have sinfully underrated is Radha Mitchell. I barely read any praise for her wonderful job as Barrie's wife in any review when she deserves just as much as Depp or Winslet.This is a moving story that everyone should be subjected to, no matter what age or mindset. Man, I loved this movie.",8,2,2,3 January 2005
Erin Brockovich," Good, but not great
","There's really nothing wrong with this movie. It's well-scripted, well-captured, well-acted (especially by Julia Roberts, but I'm sure I'm not the first to say so), well-staged, and well-decorated. There's a level of realism here not seen in a lot of movies, and I suppose that's something that gives the movie credit. But the truth is there's not much here.Julia Roberts is marvelously natural, and Albert Finney complements her well, though, truth be told, he only has one scene where his acting can really show off. There are touching moments between Brockovich and her kids and between Brockovich and George, her main squeeze during the movie. Marg Helgenberger gives a nice turn as a depressingly disparate victim of the company that Brockovich is attacking. But it all adds up do a genuinely moving but formulaic film that seems to add nothing new to the genre but one more movie.A lot of people seem to lift the movie up because of how brave its main character is and what she stands for. It's a worthy cause, to be sure, but is it cause to label Erin Brockovich as a great movie? I don't think so. It's good, I enjoyed it, but it's nothing special.",7,1,3,1 October 2006
Unbreakable," So close to being great
","It's really frustrating to find a movie that comes so close to being great and only a few minor faults are holding it back. Luckily, it's not so frustrating that it ruins the experience. Unbreakable is still an intense and emotional movie and I wish M. Night Shyamalan was still making movies like this.Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man unhappy with his marriage and his relationship with his son. David is trying to get a job in New York so he can move out of the house and move his life in his own direction. When his train back from New York derails, David is the only survivor and he is sought out by a fragile man named Elijah, who believes David is special.This could easily be cheesy, but Shyamalan wisely plays up the comic-book feeling of the plot while maintaining a certain sense of reality. Bruce Willis is a good choice as the passive David, a man not sure where he fits in the world. Samuel Jackson, always good, is great here; it's probably his best role that I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Robin Wright Penn also has some touching moments as Willis's despairing wife, as does Spencer Treat Clark as his neglected but loving son.The problem is not with the story or cast, but with the direction. There are some awkward transitions and some moments that should have been played out longer; it sometimes feels like Shyamalan is copping out on giving us real drama and instead giving us an outline of what happened. But no matter; it's still an intriguing movie and it has some great images. And while it may not be on par with his The Sixth Sense and Signs, it comes close, and that's good enough.",8,20,32,18 November 2006
Fight Club," Oh, Fight Club, you almost had me there
","Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment.",7,31,57,21 December 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Well worth it
","My sister and I have been waiting for a movie that could do this story justice for some time. As kids, we used to watch a cartoon version that was bland and pretty much boring. My mom taped a real life version off of TV that was a lot more entertaining than the cartoon and we watched that one instead for a while. We recently rewatched it, and I realized that most of the magical creatures (except Aslan, the fauns, and the centaurs) were added in with animation- really bad 2D animation- which pretty much ruined it for me. So I knew that any version that came out now would have to be convincing in its special effects or face my wrath on the IMDb voting polls.Then this came out. And I knew I didn't have to worry.Every creature looks real. Even if you can tell it's CGI, it's brilliant CGI and lets you sink into the world of Narnia without worrying about the fact that it's a movie. I was particularly worried about the Beavers, because in the TV version they were played by people in beaver costumes, and I don't care how young you are, you know they're people in beaver costumes. However, the beavers in this are wonderfully played by computer animation, made to look very real while still enabling them to talk, and given some of the best lines in the movie. Aslan, who I wasn't really worried about because they just HAD to get Aslan right, is a great piece of art and his eyes are as expressive as any human's. Liam Neeson is charming and soothing as his voice, completing the picture. The evil creatures are just as convincing as the good, if not as nice-looking. The landscapes are just as incredible as the magical animals, and it's no surprise that the same effects team that worked on Lord of the Rings did this movie too.The movie's effects aren't the only good thing about it either, thankfully. The screenplay stays true to the book for the most part, throwing in a couple of extra scenes that seem unneeded but provide for some good action and a backstory for the Pevensie family. The movie starts out with an effective air raid scene that is not in the book, and at first I was kind of annoyed, but as the movie progressed I realized that it was necessary, in a way, not to the story but to the movie. In the scene, Mrs. Pevensie is ushering her children to the bomb shelter when Edmund (Skandar Keynes) suddenly runs back to save a picture of his father, who is fighting in World War II. Peter (William Moseley) tries to stop him and when he brings him back to the bomb shelter he yells, 'Why can't you just do what your told?' Peter asks him the same thing again when Edmund is hurt trying to save Peter's life near the end.The cast probably was the most risky part of this movie for its director, Andrew Adamson. Finding convincing child actors who are capable of doing a dramatic film like this one yet actually look their age is tough in this day and age where children are usually the stars of bad screwball comedies. However, the four leads are definitely capable, especially Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy, and Keynes. Both of them are able to show a wide range of emotions, often in the same scene, and Keynes makes the transformation that Edmund goes through after being rescued from the queen perfectly evident through his wonderfully expressive face. Tilda Swinton was not the queen I was expecting after the TV version, but she grew on me, and by the end I had forgotten she was an actress and was riveted in the queen's evilness.This movie is worth the money if only for the effects, but luckily, your money is spent on a good cast and worthy screenplay. I don't think this will be up for any Oscars other than Best Visual Effects, but if it's up for Best Picture, I'll certainly be cheering it on.",8,0,0,7 January 2006
The Terminator," Ah, Ahnold
","He's buff, stone-faced, and genuinely scary in this movie- my first thought at the end of this movie was 'He'd make a good governor of California.' Well, perhaps not. But it's hard to imagine The Terminator without Schwarzeneggar (I attempted to spell it without looking), and maybe that's only because the Terminator and Arnold have become synonymous since 1984. You can't think Terminator without thinking 'Ah'll be back.' Of course, I wasn't even born in '84, so I don't really know how the movie was received before he became a cultural icon, but from the perspective of a 16-year-old here and now, I think it's a great movie.When you ignore the fact that now Ahnold is and always will be the Terminator, you can see that he really was good in the role. Sure, there isn't much for him to do- he talks in monotone, glares, and flexes- but his build, his accent, his face, everything about him was built for playing a robot- excuse me, cyborg. Kyle Reese would yell at me for being so glib.The hero of the movie, the aforementioned Kyle Reese, is played by Michael Biehn, who has a few shining moments, but doesn't really impress for the rest of the film. Linda Hamilton, on the other hand, shines throughout the entire movie as a young woman whose entire life turns upside down. She doesn't do the girlish freakout, a clichÃ© that has grown really old, probably even by 1984; instead, she focuses on the fact that her life depends on every move she makes- while still showing fear. Hamilton pulls that off magnificently, despite a script that throws a few cheesy lines her way, thought she handles the cheese a lot better than Biehn does.I may sound pretty critical so far, what with the cheese and my disappointment with one of the main stars, but the truth is, despite those flaws, the rest of the movie delivers. Some people say this movie has an anti-nuclear-war message- I say, sure, for maybe five minutes. This isn't a message movie- it's a thriller, full of meaty action that really does thrill. The whole movie is basically a chase scene, but the chasing is gripping and creatively laid out. The only other James Cameron film I've seen is Titanic, and with these two movies I can tell that Cameron is very good at engaging the audience in intelligent action. The plot line is as creative as the action with its detailed mythology and harrowing climax. I don't want to ruin any of it though, because it's really a good story. Just see it, and you'll understand.It's a fun movie, and by now has been raised into the classic zone. And after seeing it a few times and not tiring of it in the least, I can see why.",8,0,1,28 April 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Powerfully emotional and inspiring
","I look back on this movie and I find myself realizing that it was one of the most moving movie's I have ever seen. Not that I've seen an incredible variety or astonishing number of movies. But I do know that I am a relatively average 17-year-old who loves movies and I was inspired by this movie in a way only a few other films have.Don Cheadle, a Best Actor Oscar contender for 2004, gives his all to his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager that sheltered hundred of refugees during the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Hotel Rwanda is more about Paul's story than the massacres in general, and that's not a bad thing. Seeing this catastrophe through the eyes of a man in Paul's position means that we are party to key figures: a U.N. Colonel (Nick Nolte) who wants to help but is constrained by the limits of his orders, a spoiled general (Fana Mokoena) who provides military protection for Rusesabagina's refugees in response to flattery and bribery, and an American journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) who delivers one of the key revelations of the movie: 'I think if people see this footage, they'll say 'Oh, my God, that's horrible.' And then they'll go on eating their dinners.' Africa is too far away for it to be of any concern to people like us.But all these characters take back seat to Paul in the narrative; they occasionally provide obstacles, such as when the general refuses to give any more police support until Paul bluffs desperately, but the movie belongs to Paul and, inherently, to his family. Don Cheadle plays Paul as a man whose family is more important to him than anything else; his first and foremost concern is for his wife and children and there are moments where he must choose between them and the other Rwandans in his care. His wife, Tatiana, is emotionally played by Sophie Okonedo as a compassionate woman who, even as strong as she turns out to be, feels she needs her husband in order to survive. The love between Paul and Tatiana is one of the anchors in this movie, and thanks to the screenwriters and Okonedo, Tatiana is just as well-developed a character as Paul.While Hotel Rwanda may focus in on this one man and his heroism, the movie manages to skillfully indict the outside (white) world for not taking the initiative to interfere in this conflict. The question of whether or not we could have done anything is moot in this movie; when faces as human as these are painted onto the problem, it seems like we at least should have done something.",9,0,0,24 December 2006
Capote," A very good movie with a great performance
","Capote is astonishing in the depths it dives. Truman Capote's motives and feelings are laid bare before us and we find ourselves sympathizing with him even while we are disgusted by him. The success of this movie is that it is brutally honest and yet at the end we still love Capote.Part of that is due to the brilliant performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. As Truman Capote travels to Kansas to write an article about how the random murders of a well-respected family are affecting the community, Hoffman does not show us how Capote changes. Hoffman changes. He goes from objective outsider to involved insider and Hoffman makes the change flawlessly- you don't even notice the change, you're so engrossed in the character.Hoffman is not the only good thing about this movie, but he is definitely the best. The writing is good, though strangely distant and shallow at times. But that's only sometimes- the way the screenplay takes its time digging deeper is wonderful. That combined with the performances and the directing creates a very good movie.",8,0,0,3 September 2006
The Bourne Identity," Definitely a superior thriller
","About halfway through this movie I realized that it was much better than the average thriller. There is a scene between Matt Damon's character, who has lost his memory, and Franka Potente's character, Marie, who picked him up based on an offer of $20,000, when Marie says he'll probably go inside and then forget she's out there, so she might as well just leave. He replies, 'How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.' This line shows the backbone of this thriller.Matt Damon does not know who he is, where he came from, or what he's supposed to be doing. We don't know either. The things he can do, however, beg the question of whether or not he is an average person. Like say, speaking several different languages and knocking two cops out in 5 seconds.This could have just been an average thriller, but this level of the unknown makes it all the more compelling. We never quite know who anyone is, not Matt Damon, nor Brian Cox, Chris Cooper, Franka Potente, Clive Owen, or Julia Stiles; but the relationships are drawn so well that we can guess and infer, and that's all we need in this. The redeeming value in this movie comes from the action sequences and the suspense. Matt Damon's stoic performance anchors everything into a cohesive and coherent picture that never fails to engross.I think this has been dismissed as just another thriller. I also think it's better than that. Go enjoy yourself and see it.",8,0,1,29 September 2006
Cast Away," Engrossing
","Robert Zemeckis will probably never again reach the heights of 'Forrest Gump', but I'm glad he continued making quality movies such as this one. Like 'Forrest Gump,' this movie is one of a kind; it's unlikely we'll ever see another movie that takes the risks that this one did. To make a movie where over three-quarters of it is just Tom Hanks, half-naked and not talking, takes a lot of guts and a lot of skill. So did 'Forrest Gump,' and Robert Zemeckis pulls it off again, though not quite with the same knack for weaving sentimentality into genuine drama that he displayed with 'Forrest Gump.'The first two hours or so of the movie is brilliant. Zemeckis and Hanks present us with Chuck Noland, a by-the-clock-or-die FedEx supervisor, who is obviously in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), who, just as obviously, loves him back. He boards a plane to Malaysia to deliver some packages and tells her he'll 'be right back.' The plane crashes in the Pacific. Chuck is the only survivor and is washed up on a deserted island. And there is where the real movie begins. We see Chuck learn how to survive and fend for himself in sequences that could have been slow and tedious but, with the realism in which they are presented, become fascinating.Tom Hanks's performance is just plain great. He takes up most of the screen time and Zemeckis lets us see into his passion and despair. Hanks, in fact, never takes a wrong step. It is the screenplay that trips up in the last 20 minutes of the production. Some people say the ending feels tacked on. I disagree; most of the ending is just fine, and fits right into this examination of what a real person would do in a situation like this. However, a few of Chuck's lines near the end strike a forced note- not because of Hanks delivery, but because one feels that no one could say something that cheesy well.Even so, this is quite an experience. Not as creative as 'Forrest Gump,' to be sure, but who cares? I don't think Zemeckis will ever try to beat his masterpiece and if he keeps making movies like this one he won't need to. This is good enough for me.",9,2,3,30 September 2006
Spirited Away," Magical and different
","The movie started and I wasn't quite sure what I was watching. There were moments at the beginning when I had no clue what was happening. But as it continued I was drawn more and more into the story to where I accepted anything the story threw my direction. I was a part of the movie in a way very few movies can involve me.Disney movies have their charms and I'm a big fan of some of them, namely the Pixar movies and a few of the 2D ones, but this will be unlike anything you've ever seen before (unless you're already familiar with Hiyao Miyazaki, in which case you'll probably be able to fully appreciate Spirited Away). I'm not going to ruin the plot for anyone, but I will say that it follows a girl named Chihiro on her journey into a spirit world and her discovery of how to take care of herself and those around her. There is far more to the movie than that, but I'll let you enjoy it for yourself. It's worth it.",9,1,1,16 November 2006
Cars," Charming
","At first I didn't expect to be invested in these characters- they're not cute little fish or bugs that you can easily feel for, and they look nothing like humans, territory that Pixar has mastered. Then as the movie's gears began grinding and the story began to develop, I realized that I was looking at these cars as real people. The most amazing thing about this movie is how the Pixar team has managed to imbue these cars with so many ranges of emotion and movement that after a while you forget that they're made of metal and glass.Of course none of that would really matter if the characters weren't likable and the story weren't good, so I'm happy to say that Pixar has done it again. It may not be as magical as Finding Nemo or as entertaining as The Incredibles, and the story may be a tad contrived at times, but that's to be expected from a cartoon. However, what made Nemo and the Incredibles great is that you didn't look at them as cartoons because their stories belonged in the world of live action. You never really forget that Cars is animation, but that's okay, because it's such a charming movie.This is a very good movie that tells its story very well. It's comforting to know that Pixar still hasn't hit its slump, and Cars makes me look forward to the next gem from this studio.",8,0,0,26 July 2006
The Little Mermaid," Almost as good as I remember it
","Movies like this remain sterling in the mind of someone like me that watched them constantly as a toddler. I would not have admitted to it, but I loved this movie. Watching The Little Mermaid again at 17 years, I don't love it quite so much, but I can still say it's a very good movie.Ariel is the youngest daughter of the king of the mermen. She dreams of walking as a human and when she meets a prince named Eric, she falls in love and trades her voice with a sea-witch in order to become human.A plot summary like that makes this movie sound incredibly boring. Memorable songs and hilarious characters like Sebastian, a crabby crab that Ariel's father assigns to keep her in check, and Scuttle, a bird who thinks he knows everything but clearly does not, keep the story lively and entertaining.This Disney movie doesn't inspire me with as many feelings of praise as the Pixar films or Beauty and the Beast or the Lion King. But it's a fun movie, and I have to say it has some of the best music Disney's ever put to film. Part of Your World, Kiss the Girl, and Under the Sea are great songs and make the movie worth seeing in themselves. Luckily, the rest of the movie is worth seeing too.",9,2,2,26 November 2006
Amadeus," A mesmerizing movie
","Does it really matter that it's not entirely historically accurate? For one thing, this movie isn't about history- it's about passion and genius. For another, I saw this movie knowing that it wasn't completely true to life, but I loved it anyway. Because what really matters is how Hulce and Abraham draw you into their characters, not permitting your eyes to leave the screen. What really matters is the fact that the movie is very entertaining in its own right- with its humor, both dark and light (I laughed every time Mozart laughed, and then even at Mozart's dad's mask), along with a witty and quotable screenplay ('I may be a vulgar man, but I assure you my music is not'). What really matters is how Forman combines everything to really show us the passion Mozart had for his music and how Mozart was a touch above Salieri when it came to music- Salieri could recognize how extraordinary Mozart's music was but could not create it himself. My favorite scene is when Salieri helps Mozart write the end of his mass. Forman wisely does not distract with anything extra and simply shifts back and forth between the two characters, allowing the actors to do their work with their faces. When I was watching this movie again for the second time, I had forgotten about that scene, and watching it again, I could not take my eyes off the TV. In fact, I think I had that problem for most of the movie.",9,1,2,22 February 2006
Hero," Beautiful movie that depends a little too much on its visuals
","Hero is a beautiful movie, full of rich colors and sweeping backdrops. Each flashback is a joy to watch simply because of that beauty and it's the beauty that keeps you watching.The storyline itself is contrived at points, but I can forgive that because this is meant to be a parable, and the movie ends so well I found myself not caring. There are times during the movie where emotion is lacking even though those should be the most passionate times. I have a feeling that is a directing or editing error though, because the actors are all marvelously in tune with what they should be feeling- something that changes a lot in this movie.Crouching Tiger wins against this movie. Ang Lee's movie has both stirring visuals and an assured, passionate story. Hero, however, is definitely worth watching and I recommend it to anyone who loves these Chinese martial arts movies.",8,0,0,22 August 2006
Patton," This is a good movie, and does not glorify war
","Contrary to popular belief, I don't think this movie glorifies war. Rather, it tells the story of a man who glorifies war and how his glorification of war was his downfall. Halfway through the film, Patton slaps and threatens to shoot a soldier because that soldier is a coward; Patton believes the soldier is dishonoring the brave men wounded in battle in front of whom the soldier is crying. This ruins Patton's career. It essentially ruins his life too, because the man loves war.And really, even just the last line can tell you what this film has to say about war- 'All glory is fleeting.' The film acknowledges that war can give glory- but it will not last.Besides that comment, all I have to say is that the film is great and straightforward, and not only because of Scott's brilliant performance but also because of the engaging screenplay and sweeping style. Definitely worth seeing.",8,1,3,13 March 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A very good movie
","This movie engaged me from beginning to end for several different reasons. One was the overall style- like everything was real. Clooney films everything as if it were real footage; but not necessarily footage that people want to see- footage people need to see. There is a certain urgency in everything- the way the camera moves, the way it focuses on one person at a time, the manner in which it changes focus. From what I have read about the making of this movie, Clooney intended to draw parallels to our time now, but I felt more of a documentary sense in this film. It does not feel like an allegory to this age, but a chronicle of that one.Another thing was the acting. Well, actually, there is no real acting in this movie, only being. David Strathairn is Edward Murrow. Frank Langella is Bill Paley. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson are the Wershbas. John McCarthy is...oh, wait. Even George Clooney isn't George Clooney in this movie. He does not steal the spotlight at all and cedes everything over to Strathairn and the storyline.The dialog is wonderful too. This is a very quotable movie, but even beyond that, the words coming out of these people's mouths are made real. Clooney has his actors speak over each other and draws attention to the important lines by having the dialog trickle away until there is only one person speaking and then repeats the process all over again- which is pretty much how real conversations take place. However, this also makes it hard to follow the plot at times and it takes a good deal of concentration in some parts to keep up.This movie's great accomplishment is creating a real setting and atmosphere and making something that was a reality then in real life into a reality now on film.",8,1,2,26 March 2006
Black Hawk Down," A blistering experience
","Black Hawk Down is simultaneously bruising to watch and impossible to look away. It is not the first war movie to place us in the middle of the action so skillfully, but it is definitely one of the best and one of the most harrowing. And it is not necessarily the endless and endlessly realistic action that makes this movie such an achievement; Scott manages to say something with that action and because of that we have a better understanding of war and those who fight it.Too much happens within the fabric of this film for me to provide a genuine summary of the plot, so I'll give a brief outline: a team of Special U.S. Forces is deployed in Mogadishu, Somalia with orders to apprehend a warlord who has created famine in his area when one of their Black Hawk helicopters is shot down and they become entangled in a never-ending battle with the Somali militia, fighting to save their own lives and the lives of the men around them.Scott has assembled a genuinely ensemble cast with virtually no standout names at the time except for Josh Hartnett and Ewan McGregor, who both do a fine job, but the character that left the deepest impact on me was Eric Bana's Hoot. Hoot is one of the few Rangers that knows his way around war and fighting and is almost ruthless in his tactics. However, he never loses his compassion and he reveals at the end that he truly understands why he fights- 'It's about the men next to you. And that's it.'The fact that this conflict was not even supposed to be war in the first place makes the movie all the more powerful. We are audience to many mistakes by the leaders of this outfit; the ground forces are led by helicopters from above and the navigators in these Black Hawks lead the Rangers astray many times. It seems to go on forever sometimes, but that is not to the detriment of the movie. On the contrary, it only adds to the reality of the situation. We are not subjected to nonstop fighting; there are moments between the soldiers and sometimes moments between the Americans and those attacking them. Even in these moments, though, Scott never relents from his indictment of war or his appreciation of the compassion of these soldiers.",9,3,6,22 December 2006
The Descent," Everything a horror movie should be
","'The Passion of the Christ' was the first R-rated movie I saw in theaters. 'The Descent' was the second. My reaction to the first was tears and a sense of fulfillment. My reaction to the second was shock and pure exhilaration. I'd have to say that they were both incredibly satisfactory reactions.The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up. There is a sense in the entire first half of the movie that something terrible will happen. Of course everyone who's seeing the movie knows to expect monsters and gore in the second half, and the filmmakers know we expect that. They fill the first 45 minutes or so with foreboding moments, some of them meant to make you jump, others just to creep you out. But of course, the characters in the movie don't know that something is coming; the filmmakers know that too, so they also fill the first part with scenes of laughter and moments of genuine friendship. The juxtaposition of these two tones in the first act of the movie does two things for the movie: it invests us in these interesting people and it gets us tense enough for when blood starts pouring.But when the action starts, who really cares about juxtaposition? The action in this movie is so harrowing and intense that it was all I could do to cover my eyes. The gore is incredibly excessive, but I found myself not caring because it should be. We've been with these characters every step of the way- we've experienced claustrophobia with them, felt the fear of dangling over a bottomless pit with them, and when we get to the bloody scenes, they are just as appalled as we are by intestines being ripped out of stomachs. We feel what they feel and it makes for an incredibly interesting experience.I suppose you could love this film just for its action, but I liked it for more than that. The characters were real and didn't fall into normal horror movie clichés. There was real human drama and it added another dimension to the action.This is a brilliantly scary movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves to pee their pants.",9,2,5,8 August 2006
Inside Man," A good movie, but it should have been better
","Because this is directed by Spike Lee, this should have been a better movie. As it stands, it is a good movie with an above-average plot that doesn't quite deliver. It could have delivered, but the screenplay reveals things in places it shouldn't reveal them and takes too long to reach its ending.However, with that said, I must say I liked the movie. The performances are great- Denzel Washington is snappy and intense in a role that requires little real acting but must have been great fun to play. He's a jerk with a big heart and brain, and you can tell Washington loves being this kind of guy. Clive Owen is appropriately firm and angry in his role as the bank's main robber, and Jodie Foster is terse and sarcastic. You never know quite who she is, which I suppose is the point.It's a very thrilling movie with some intense action sequences and some scenes that are just plain brilliant. A scene where Clive Owen's character and a kid discuss the kid's video game is so true, as is the scene where the Sikh is mistaken for an Arab. The flash-forwards to interrogations of everyone at the crime scene are helpful and allow some character to show through.All in all, the movie was entertaining but not as complete as it could have been. I like it though, and I definitely recommend it.",7,1,2,10 September 2006
Pulp Fiction," An undeniably great movie
","How Quentin Tarantino managed to pull this off is a mystery. Where he got these characters from is even more of a mystery. This movie is a celebration of all things trashy, and yet I got the feeling that when Tarantino started making this movie he realized he could make it so much more than that. He has a gold mine of character and dialogue here, and he has used it up and more.The best thing about this movie is its dialogue. Everything everyone says is so natural; you believe someone would say these things in real life. Every conversation is essential to the plot, but when they take place they feel spontaneous. Even sequences that would feel contrived under a lesser screenplay or lesser director feel perfect in this movie, such as the scene between Willis and the cabdriver, or the scene with Uma Thurman and John Travolta dancing at the restaurant.Not only are conversations natural, but the way events shape out feels like real life also. When we are expecting Mia and Vince to get on the good foot and do the bad thing, what we get instead is a crisis in which Mia almost dies. When we expect Butch to get killed, instead he does the killing. The movie felt like it was leading me in one direction but then led me in another, but I didn't feel gypped because it felt right.And the actors are something else in this movie. John Travolta did not give the performance I expected from him- I expected hammy Travolta and what I got was understated Travolta that fit into everything around him; definitely not what I expected. Sam Jackson has the most fun in this movie, but manages to keep it real at the same time. I can't even get into everyone else, simply because there are so many good performances.I gave the movie a 10 (something I've done for only three other movies) because it's so complete. I had trouble figuring out what the point of the movie is, and I'm still not sure, but it really doesn't matter. The stories are so intriguing and the characters are so engaging, I don't really care about the point of it all. I just want to see it again.",10,1,4,3 September 2006
The Da Vinci Code," I liked it- really
","I went into the movie with the knowledge that Cannes audiences laughed at it instead of with it, and was pretty worried. However, I was really wasn't disappointed with it, even at its lowest points.Those lowest points come near the end when the story begins to drag into multiple endings that aren't necessarily boring but more anticlimactic. The involving action and plot twists leading up to the end should signal a more dramatic finish. The real finish works, but it seems like it could have played out in a more entertaining fashion.However, the high points of the movie outweigh the occasional dull moment. The actors, for example, are quite good. I especially enjoyed Paul Bettany and Ian McKellan, but then again, they're always good. I've loved Paul Bettany since A Beautiful Mind, and it's encouraging to see that he's still finding good roles. Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou have surprisingly little to do besides look scared/pensive/incredulous, but they do well with what they have. Regarding Alfred Molina, I wish we could've seen more of him- but not in the way we see more of Bettany. You'll see what I mean if you go to the movie.And as for the controversy surrounding the movie- well, I was going to say that you should disregard it, but you really shouldn't. No one should change their faith over a movie or a book, and I don't think this sort of popcorn fare will. The debate has been over-hyped for a year or so since Dan Brown's book came under scrutiny by the press. All I can say is that the controversial ideas mentioned in this movie are just that- ideas, not proved or dismissed. If it means that much to you, don't see it. If you think you can get past it, then by all means, see it. It's fun and definitely worth it.",7,0,2,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The best Harry Potter movie so far, and a good movie to boot
","I never really liked the first two movies in this series- they failed to entertain and capture me like the books did, even though the first two books were not as entertaining and capturing as the following four. Prisoner of Azkaban was a good movie, but I was angry at some plot points left out and the treatment of Hermione as a character (She's cool in the movies, but uncool in the books. Correct me if I'm wrong.) Now this one completely delivers- even despite the missing plot points, something Azkaban (the movie) failed to fully do.This movie holds everything that the book does. The action is fun and worth watching and it stays pretty much true to the major plot points in the book. Director Mike Newell and Screenwriter Steve Kloves took a few liberties, but that's necessary for a Bible-length book like Harry Potter. But where the first two failed and the third only began to comprehend was how to harness the spirit of Rowling's writing. Rowling has dry humor and loves her characters and settings, imbuing each one with something wonderful. Newell captures both excellently in this movie- the dry humor and the wonder in her characters- and he does so without strenuously copying every plot detail from the book (listen up, Chris Columbus).I loved this movie and love it apart from the book. The cast is still good and has always been good, and Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes make good additions to it. If the fifth movie is as good as this one, I'll say it was worth making the series into a movie franchise.",8,0,1,21 March 2006
The Departed," Best movie of the year
","The very beginning of The Departed struck me as very similar to GoodFellas. It begins with a boy telling of his first experiences with the mob. The locale even seemed the same. There are other instances in the movie where Scorsese seems to allude back to GoodFellas, a movie many consider to be one of his masterpieces, but in my opinion I think The Departed is all its own and even exceeds GoodFellas in quality and profundity. And besides that, it's also incredibly entertaining.The movie has been advertised as a thriller, and it succeeds at that very well. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a cop assigned to not be a cop ever again; instead, he will be a plant in Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) outfit. Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan, a cop who works on the side for Costello who entrusts him with the job of finding the mole in his gang. Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of deceit and mistrust with bloody and jarring violence mixed with intense scenes where the various disguises are on the verge of being uncovered. It's a very entertaining tapestry; nothing is for sure, and while that could have been frustrating, Scorsese involves you so much in the characters that you understand that when you're wondering if Billy or Colin is lying, they're wondering the same thing.Exploring themes like family and identity and loyalty is not new hat for Scorsese. He contemplated the same ideas in GoodFellas with his depiction of the life of a mafia man. But in The Departed he takes it a step farther and asks the question of what happens when you lose that identity and pretend to be someone you're not. This opens up opportunities to discover what happens to the characters' relationships in these circumstances. Scorsese was blessed with an amazing cast to help him in this task. Leonardo Dicaprio gave an amazing performance two years ago in The Aviator, and while I think that may be his better performance, there's no denying the power and truth in his desperately soul-searching undercover cop. He deserves another Oscar nomination for this, but he probably won't get it because Jack Nicholson is getting most of the notice (not all of it good) for his performance. Some critics are complaining that Nicholson went over the top; I don't think so at all. Everything he did was appropriate as the ultimate kingpin of the Boston mob because his character can get away with anything and knows it. Matt Damon has the least to do of the three of them, but Damon is a good actor and is no less than that here. Vera Farmiga has a good stint as Damon's love interest and Dicaprio's shrink; the lack of identity for both Damon's and Dicaprio's characters has a tasking effect on her and she holds her own against the two men.There's no doubt in my mind that this is the best movie of the year. It has by far the best ending to a Scorsese movie out of the three I've seen. The profundity and inevitability of the last few scenes is perfect. If only the Academy would agree. The only true contenders against it so far for the Oscar are Babel (not as complete as this one) and The Queen (which isn't as big or brawny as The Departed). Besides, Scorsese has been ignored for far too long. This would be a very appropriate time for him to win, and with this movie he would deserve it.But Oscars aside, I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates thrilling stories with meaning behind them. Those kinds of movies are few and far between, so grab onto this one and keep hold of it while it lasts.",9,1,2,5 December 2006
Wedding Crashers," The cast is great, the movie good
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn sure know how to have fun. They seem to bounce off of each other with ease and pleasure, milking each scene for all it's worth. That pleasure is contagious in this movie, a buddy comedy that turns into a romantic comedy with a little bit of drama mixed in and a pinch of Will Ferrell to spice things up in the last act- all of which blends together quite nicely, which really is no surprise at all considering the talent involved.Vaughn and Wilson are marriage counselors (how these characters ever got into this field of work is beyond me- beyond them too, probably) who spend a few months each year crashing weddings (i.e. attending weddings without invitation and singling out a young woman, one for each man, for a night of 'fun'; after all, women are more prone to give in to a charming man in light of the passions brought about by weddings, and the two men don't see any harm in taking advantage of this). Their characters, Jeremy Grey and John Beckwith respectively, are so serious about wedding crashing that they have a whole list of rules and a specific season in which they can crash. Unfortunately for the two of them, at a wedding late in the season, both of them end up involved with girls they can't seem to get away from.And this is where the romantic comedy comes into play. Until this point, all the funny came from the banter back and forth between Wilson and Vaughn (who, by the way, should form their own improv duo), but Isla Fisher steals every scene she's in as a sex-obsessed daughter of a government official (Christopher Walken) who has her heart (and body) set on Jeremy. This is a case where going over the top was exactly what was needed, and Isla Fisher delivers with gusto. Rachel McAdams has a plainer and less flashy role as Fisher's sister and, coincidentally, the woman that steals Owen Wilson's heart right out from under him, but she, as usual, is still quite good. Will Ferrell makes a cameo appearance near the end as the man that invented wedding crashing, and his performance deserves to be seen for how terribly wrong it is and yet how funny it still manages to be.The cast is better than the movie though, which is not an entirely bad thing. Instead of weighing us down with a deep message about the power of love and love conquering all, Wedding Crashers lets its actors run wild. Though it's not without its morals- it celebrates having fun and political incorrectness, but it also has an understanding of a person's limits and responsibilities to himself and those he cares about. But really, a movie like this is just a playground for the talent involved. And boy is it fun to watch them play.",7,1,2,31 December 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Wonderfully unique
","I was never a huge fan of Will Ferrell's. To me, he's just like Ben Stiller and Adam Sandler in that he hasn't outgrown adolescent status when it comes to his sense of humor. However, seeing him in Wedding Crashers, The Producers, and Talladega Nights recently forced me to appreciate the comedic talent that he's been hiding. And now, with Stranger Than Fiction, Will Ferrell has forced me to acknowledge that he can act. And quite well, too, which was a very pleasant surprise. Luckily, the movie was just as good as he was.Playing Harold Crick, an IRS agent without a social life who counts his toothbrush strokes each and every morning of his life, Will Ferrell is marvelously understated. Some critics have said he underplays Crick to the point of boredom, but I think he leaves enough of himself to keep us entertained. And even with that, the plot and characters around him are so amusing and intriguing it wouldn't have mattered if Crick were dull.The story kicks off to a start within the first five minutes as we embark on Crick's daily routine, narrated down to the very last carefully counted step on his way to work by Emma Thompson, a suicidal writer who is authoring her next book about Crick and his humdrum way of living. However, Crick hears her voice dictating his every move and is upset by this- naturally. Especially when he hears Thompson predicting his premature death.Forster deftly balances Harold's impending doom with his discovery of the joys of life, most importantly in Ana Pascal, a baker played by Maggie Gyllenhaal (wonderful and fiery), who at first hates Crick and his IRS background but then grows to love him. Through Pascal, Harold learns how to enjoy life outside of his job, which he never enjoyed in the first place. The genius of Stranger Than Fiction is that it manages to take matters of life and death very seriously while at the same time finding much light in simple everyday facets of the world such as cookies or a kiss or a good book. I'm not sure how you combine existentialism and compassion in the same movie, but Forster and Ferrel and Co. pulled it off in a very creative way.",8,1,2,4 January 2007
The Green Mile," A profoundly moving movie
","I found myself nearly moved to tears by this film and its characters. The story is wonderful and the movie is cast so well, you can almost forgive the moments where it doesn't feel quite real.Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, who is the highest-ranking guard at death row. The movie begins with a new prisoner (Michael Clarke Duncan) arriving at the Green Mile as they call it, so named after the green floor. This new prisoner changes everyone in the prison- criminals and guards alike.The performances very nearly make the movie. Tom Hanks doesn't have an incredible amount of acting to do (Duncan and Jeter take the main honors in this movie), but as usual he is so honest and real I had no trouble believing him, no matter how outrageous any choices his character makes might seem. I also liked David Morse as Brutal, Edgecomb's second-in-command and good friend. Neither actor is able to steal the scene away from the prisoners though; and I don't think they really try to. If they did, it would have thrown the movie off-balance. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a simple character but he invests him with such passion and honesty that he comes off as real and unreal at the same time- the perfect combination for a movie about the unexplainable. He is perfect as Coffey, and without such a good performance in this role, the movie would have been mediocre. Michael Jeter is also very good and sympathetic in his role as the French prisoner. Doug Hutchison is appropriately sleazy in his role and Sam Rockwell appropriately crazy in his. The way these performances fit together is amazing to watch.Besides the cast, the story is superb. It balances the real and supernatural so well, the supernatural seems to fit perfectly into this world. The movie also wisely does not explain the phenomena- sometimes there are things we just can't explain. I won't ruin exactly what happens, but I will say this: the movie was telling its story well before anything supernatural happened, but when it does happen it feels right, and you know you're dealing with a movie that has all the trappings of achieving greatness.However there are certain scenes that feel awkward to me. The scene where Paul invites the other guards to dinner and then forces them to decide what to do seemed contrived to me, as did the entire prologue to the movie. Even so, I really liked the movie and the epilogue is so satisfying and it completes the movie so well, I'm willing to put those scenes aside and wholeheartedly recommend this movie. It's quite a story, and deserves to be heard by anyone who loves movies.",8,0,1,17 September 2006
Ray," While Foxx is very good, there's more to it than the main character
","I've seen this movie three times now, and it has still not grown weary to me. I have enjoyed it equally all three times which is rare for a movie. For me, I usually get tired of films after the second or third time, for whatever reason- not so with Ray.This is probably because Ray is so interesting- it chronicles the very interesting life of a very interesting man. His background is interesting, his music is interesting, the people around him are interesting. Luckily, all this interesting material is treated very lovingly, but also very honestly. The movie does not downplay his addiction to heroin, and while it does not dedicate itself to all of Ray's female conquests on the road, the film shows enough of them to get the effect across to us.Ray Charles is played by Jamie Foxx. Though I've seen many people comment that Foxx only captured the mannerisms and that his performance did not go deep enough, I disagree. Instead of just showing us a man who walked and talked strangely, Foxx injects real emotion into all of Charles's words and movements. His performance is more than just a caricature- it is a real portrait. He deserved the Best Actor Award- even though I was rooting for Don Cheadle, who was equally deserving for creating a man for us, rather than inhabiting one.People say this is Foxx's movie, and to some extent, I have to agree. There is, however, the case of the superb supporting cast. Kerry Washington brings much dimension to the role of Ray's wife- there is one moment where Ray is crying because of the effects of his past mistakes; we see Washington move toward him, we see her wanting to comfort him because she still loves him despite all he's done, but no, she stops, because she is a strong woman and knows she can't help him. Regina King is just as impressive for her sassy performance as one of Ray's backup singers with whom he has an affair, and I also liked Sharon Warren as Ray's firm mother, even though I thought some of the flashbacks were the weakest parts of the movie- they were definitely not weak because of her.Ray is a wonderful movie and deserves to be seen at least once by everyone, if only so that everyone can experience Ray Charles's turbulent life, his redemption, and his music.",8,0,1,14 April 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," My new favorite movie
","Before I saw this movie, it was hard for me to imagine why so many people liked it. I figured it must be one of those gritty movies that people like because of its harsh realism, but in truth it is so much more than that. In fact, I don't find it very gritty at all. I can now understand why it is the second highest movie on IMDb's Top 250 and why so many of my friends list it as their favorite movie. It is the most emotionally powerful movie I've ever seen and I doubt anything I see will top it.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman plays the convicted killer Ellis Redding that befriends Andy in prison. These are two very touching and true performances. Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for the quiet intensity he brought to his role. He takes on the right sense of mystery required for the role and he gives the movie the conviction it needs to reach its emotional heights. Marlon Brando claimed that some roles are actor-proof- the story is so good that no actor can mess it up. This could possibly be one of those roles, but I can't help feeling that a lesser actor would have overacted and destroyed Robbins's character. Morgan Freeman was nominated, and justly so (though it is an injustice that he was chosen above Robbins; they both are equals in this movie). He complements Robbins beautifully as a stoic man that understands prison life better than anyone else. He also narrates the movie; we see things through his eyes and experience things through his words. As in Million Dollar Baby, his voice provides the movie with its thematic focus. The supporting cast is fine, but James Whitmore stands out as the prison librarian.The actors do not make this a great movie though. They were given a great story and they lived it for us perfectly, but it is the story that lives on after the movie is over. Stephen King may be a pop fiction author, but he has an extraordinary grasp on human nature which is brought to light in Shawshank.Marlon Brando also said that movies are good because of what we bring to them, and I suppose there's some truth in that, though there are some movies that are good no matter what- Casablanca and Citizen Kane, for example. I don't know which category this movie belongs to and I'm afraid that because I love it so much I don't trust myself to say. I can say, however, that everyone can identify with the triumph of the human spirit, and maybe that explains why it is such a beloved movie.It really is a shame that The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994, the same year as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. All three are great movies, and all three deserved Best Picture. But to me, Shawshank is the best of them all and will continue to resonate with me for a long time to come.",10,0,0,14 October 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," An incredibly thrilling movie
","If The Silence of the Lambs had been about Clarice chasing after Buffalo Bill, the movie would have been boring, and would have gone on a list filled with every other average thriller ever made. If The Silence of the Lambs had simply been about Clarice and Hannibal, we would've been deprived one of the most thrilling sequences ever put to film. All three of the characters- Clarice, Hannibal, and Buffalo Bill- are essential to why this movie is so good.The movie works effectively as a thriller in Clarice's chase of Buffalo Bill, there's no doubt about that. But the added dynamic of Hannibal probing into Clarice's psyche makes it so much better. When Clarice (Jodie Foster) is sent to Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) cell to learn from him and get information on the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), she is told not to give Dr. Lecter any personal information. He is a former psychiatrist who ate his victims, and he can deduce volumes about a person just by looking at her. Clarice, in an attempt to gain his trust, does give him personal information. I wouldn't call this a mistake, even though she went against her supervisor's advice, because she does gain his trust, and in the process, we learn more about Lecter and Clarice than we could've otherwise.A plot summary would have you believe that the story of this movie is Clarice's search for Buffalo Bill through Lecter, but the real story lies in how Lecter reveals information about Bill to Clarice and what we learn about the two of them in the process. A lesser movie would have depended on action and violence to tell this story- and make no mistake, there is definitely violence in this movie. But the brilliance of The Silence of the Lambs is that it depends on character to tell its story.And thank God for Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins being in it to make those characters. Jodie Foster plays a woman in a man's world, and she conveys the awkwardness and defiant streak that this brings out in her. There are moments where she plays the sycophant to get what she needs from the men around her, and others where she takes charge and we can hear the self-consciousness in her voice. Hopkins plays a creature that also happens to be human. He plays Lecter creepily, of course, and he pulls that aspect off quite well; but there is more to Lecter than just being creepy- he is also brilliant, and he has desires just like any other human being. Hopkins makes this noticeable. Ted Levine has less of a chance to show his chops, but what we do see of him is compelling and unsettling- he makes a wonderful villain.This is one of my favorite movies, now that I've finally seen it. It deserves it's place as one of the top movies of all time because it exceeds all expectations of what it's kind of movie should be, and in the process it surpasses great movies of more dependable genres.",9,0,0,3 September 2006
Mr. Holland's Opus," 'Life is what happens when you're making other plans'
","This is a line of the Beatles' song that Mr. Holland sings to his son, Cole, at a concert. I've seen this movie plenty of times, but for the first time, I noticed just how well this line resonates in this movie. In fact, this line is the basis for the movie, and could stand in for the whole movie in a pinch- except that we would be missing out on one of the most moving and inspirational films to come out of Hollywood in the past few years.Mr. Holland's Opus is the story of a man who loves music, who practically lives and breathes music. We see at the beginning of the film, and throughout the rest of it, a man who is most passionate when he is within music. When his wife informs him that she is pregnant, he likens the feeling to falling in love with John Coltrane's music. When a student complains to him that he knows everything there is to know about music, Mr. Holland responds by reminding him that the name of his class is Music Appreciation and explaining forcefully that it doesn't matter how much you know about music if you don't appreciate it.The movie takes Mr. Holland through three decades- from the '60s to the mid-'90s. In the spirit of nostalgia films like Forrest Gump, we are guided through the decades by vignettes of archive footage depicting scenes such as Nixon announcing his resignation, Gerald Ford tripping down the stairs, and even good old Frankenfurter representing the sexual revolution. As a piece of nostalgia for those times and the days of high school, Mr. Holland's Opus works great. As a chronicle of a man's life and the impact he has on others, it works even better.This film could have turned into cheap schmaltz, but through its cast and a story that reaches wonderful poignancy and honesty at times, it manages to represent something so much more than that. Richard Dreyfuss, always a natural actor, is perfectly real and moving as Glenn Holland. I can't describe his performance in words, simply because it deserves to be seen more than just written about. And even though this is basically Dreyfuss's movie, the supporting cast makes an impression as well. Glenne Headly, as Mr. Holland's wife, shows tremendous resilience and emotion as the mother of a disabled child. When she explodes at her husband because of his lack of understanding, you explode with her, because we believe every word she is saying.I don't know if movies can change lives. I think some have the potential to. I know there are movies that can inspire their audiences to be better people- It's a Wonderful Life is one; Casablanca is another. While Mr. Holland's Opus does not reach the quality that those two do (and who can blame it?), it has a similar and near equal impact, and that is definitely a compliment. And how perfect- a movie about a man who changes lives that can also change lives.",9,7,8,22 April 2006
The Matrix," I love this movie
","The Matrix has become such an iconic movie that it's hard to say anything new about it. I'm hesitant to try. Everyone knows it's a good movie- and if they don't believe it to be good, they know it's a well-loved movie. I, for one, love it, but I don't think it deserves to be so high up in the Top 250.The Matrix is a good example of a movie that pretends to be about something in order to keep your attention. The truth is that the story in this movie is so good and the characters so engaging that it doesn't need the message (be careful about getting too dependent on your machines- they might kill you). The way the story is executed is also nearly ingenious. When we first meet Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer for a software business that sidelines as a black market dealer in computer parts, we do not know the secret of the Matrix. The Wachowski brothers do not reveal the secret till about a quarter of the way through the movie- the perfect time to do it; any shorter, and it wouldn't have been a shock; any longer, and the movie would have become boring and there would have been less action, which is the real star of this movie.Neo meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a man proclaimed to be a terrorist by the government through the media, who gives Neo the choice between returning to his boring life and discovering the truth about the Matrix. Neo's choice sends him and the characters he meets into intense gun-and-fistfights. In between the action sequences, Morpheus spouts some philosophical tripe that could be considered deep, but there's really no life behind it; I didn't care. The movie is fun, and that's all that matters.I don't think it's a great movie, but that doesn't matter. If you're just looking to have fun and sit on the edge of your seat for a few hours, then this is a great movie for that.",8,0,1,15 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," I love these movies
","This one especially. It all started right here, and despite the cheesy lines and some of the bad effects (even though most of them are pretty incredible, especially for that time), I can't help but love it.Maybe it's the actors. Because let's face it, these actors were born to play these parts. Mark Hamill never really had another hit, and really, honestly, he's not a very good actor. But he was perfect for this role- some may say he's too whiny, but isn't that really what Luke was at the beginning? The same goes for Carrie Fisher- she never had another big, important movie like these, but I can't imagine the movie without her. Maybe other people can, and that's okay for them, but for me, I can't see anyone else as Leia.And what would this movie be without Harrison Ford? I have a theory that the reason the newest three Star Wars don't match up at all to the old ones is because the characters aren't interesting at all. Anakin is vaguely interesting, but we already know his story and Hayden Christensen doesn't do anything with the part to keep us intrigued. Amidala is boring, and while I think Ewan McGregor is a great actor, there was nothing he could do to instill anything worth watching into the character they wrote for Obi-Wan.And that's why these movies need Harrison Ford. Han Solo is without a doubt the most interesting character. In the new ones, there's no one with snappy retorts and sharp comments to keep the pace of the movie up. In the new ones, there's no one to give us the surprise ending we knew was coming but we didn't know how they were going to pull it off. I don't know about anyone else, but when I first saw this, I thought Han had actually left for good. It didn't even occur to me that he would come back to save the day in the end. And I'm not stupid. At least that's what they tell me. And without Harrison Ford, Han Solo would not be near as interesting as he is.Alec Guinness deserves plenty of credit too. His part is without a doubt the most boring in the movie, yet he makes it worth watching. His lines are usually descriptions, clichés, or they provide backstory. The actors in CSI will tell you that lines like that are hard to make entertaining. Yet Guinness is able to do so with years of training. It's no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for it.Oh, and there's the awesome action sequences with the light saber duels that, even though they tend to repeat themselves over and over, are incredibly dazzling. There's the epic feel and the neverending story of it all. There's the beautiful scenery and realistic set pieces. There's James Earl Jones's and Anthony Daniels's respectively foreboding and entertaining voiceovers, with Vader's wonderfully addicting breathing. There's the sweeping cinematography and that even makes the intimate scenes seem big while still retaining the urgency and the, well, intimacy of it all.It's a good movie.",9,2,3,15 January 2006
Goodfellas," Such a great movie
","And yet the ending felt like a copout, an anticlimactic way for the filmmakers to get out of coming up with something better. This movie deserved a great ending, and it got a quick job instead. But maybe that's as it should be. Maybe there was no better way to end this incredible movie. It's a true story, so obviously the movie had to end a certain way. However, considering the talent involved, you'd expect something more.But however much I didn't like the ending was a quarter of how much I liked the rest of the movie. Maybe this isn't how the mob actually works, but the way Martin Scorcese films it seems about as realistic as a movie could get. The narrator takes us into the inner workings of the mob, explaining how everything is done and what everyone's job is. Of course, that would mean nothing without good characters, and the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), is a great one. Not a great person, mind you; he's wanted to be in the mob all his life and the movie chronicles all sorts of nasty things he and his colleagues do to other people. But the character is great, partially because Liotta is so magnetizing. One of my friends thinks Liotta is the worst in the movie, but I don't think so. We see everything from his perspective, so we actually don't see a whole lot of him. But when we do, the movie is on.Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro give good performances as Hill's best friends, and Pesci deserved his Oscar for being a hothead that causes the mob a lot of trouble. But I really think Liotta takes the best performance in the movie and his was definitely an underrated one. Lorraine Bracco is also effective and versatile as Hill's wife. The two of them are more than convincing from beginning to end and the movie would not be the same without them.Martin Scorcese has made a brilliant movie, never boring, always alive. He's obviously a master director, but that darn endingÂ…maybe the next time I see the movie the ending won't bug me so much. Maybe I'm overreacting. I certainly wouldn't want my qualms about the resolution to keep anyone from seeing such an incredible film.",9,0,0,4 October 2006
The Wizard of Oz," One of the greatest movies ever made
","It's hard to pinpoint exactly why this is such a good movie. I loved it when I was a kid- and I can't say exactly why it was so good back then either. And yet I can't deny the fact that it's a great movie.The story sounds ludicrous if slightly charming- Dorothy, a young farm girl, gets caught in a tornado with her dog Toto and, when the storm finally sets her house down, finds herself in the magical land of Oz where she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, all of whom look strangely like the farmhands that work with her aunt and uncle. Dorothy is sent on a journey down the Yellow Brick Road to Emerald City to find the Wizard of Oz whom she is led to believe will help her get back to Kansas.Apparently, L. Frank Baum intended it as an allegory to the politics of the time, but I can't see why anyone would care about that when the movie stands on its own two legs just fine. I think the main reason it works so well is that there is never a feeling of ridiculousness throughout the entire movie. Oz is strange, but it's meant to be strange; it never feels completely unrealistic though. I think this has something to do with the contrast provided by the Technicolor applied to the film when Dorothy is Oz and the sepia look when Dorothy is in Kansas. Oz is a different world, but not an entirely unreal world. Our dreams may be larger than life, but there is always something very real about them.Maybe that's the special allure this movie always has for me. Oz is real in this movie. There's never a sure explanation of Oz as Dorothy's dream, but there might as well be. And when I dream, I want to escape into that world because sometimes it's more exciting and better. Dorothy's world is drab, and Oz helps her to see the good in it- the color in it.Metaphors aside, The Wizard of Oz is a fun movie. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of the best songs ever recorded, and many of the other songs in the movie are memorable. Judy Garland is obviously not an amazing actor, but her naïveté makes her performance very true and it's near impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.It may be hard for me to establish exactly why The Wizard of Oz has remained such a classic, but there's no difficulty in saying that it is truly a great movie.",9,3,4,26 November 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Nothing incredibly special, but there are still some hilarious moments
","There are points in this movie that are unquestionably funny, despite how stupid they are. Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, and Sacha Baron Cohen know how to get their laughs and they don't ever back down.The movie starts out kind of slow, and not very humorous, but it picks up really fast (kind of like its hero) and starts throwing one joke after another at you. Not all of them fly, but most of them are good, and I enjoyed it.Some people are calling it satire, and I suppose it is, but I don't think I cared enough about the movie to notice the satire. It's smart, but it's pretty much there just for us to laugh with it, and in that, it succeeds.",6,1,5,22 August 2006
