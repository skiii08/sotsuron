The Blair Witch Project," Most Frightening Film I have Ever Seen
","Not since I was a child have I been afraid of the dark.  Through Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm St., Halloween, I have been able to sleep soundly after viewing such films.  After this ferociously horrifying movie, I could not sleep.  I would shut the lights off and try not to, but think of any scene in the movie and have to turn the lights on again.  If you have any interest in the horror genre or just like being scared, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!",10,1,2,31 May 1999
