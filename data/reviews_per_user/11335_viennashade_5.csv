3:10 to Yuma," They were on their way to an easy 10 stars...
","Okay, I admit the first time I watched this it did not make as big an impression on me, but seeing it again I'm going to give it a 9. There are a lot of holes and flaws and 'wha??' moments, but in spite of it all I really enjoyed it overall and it's somehow different. I don't usually watch a film a second time so I must have seen something in it.Yes, a lot of disbelief needs to be suspended and tolerance expended, increasingly toward the end. In all these types of action movies you see these things like people being shot yet still able to run and fight and ride, but this one takes it further, stretching the imagination until it snaps. So why was I so willing to forgive and overlook? The performances, mostly, the complex layers of characters, and just that cat & mouse, back & forth, push & pull, and all the weird good guy-bad guy teamwork.A combination Western and character study, we get long looks into the psyches of these two fascinating men, and little by little the motivations for their unlikely actions start to come clear. So many times throughout this movie Wade could have killed Evans, starting from the first 15 minutes. A lot of it was 'the movies,' of course, but I like to think some of it was how those characters would really have acted. To further attempt to explain it away...some of it could also have been that Wade knew he didn't have to try too hard, and was just making a game of it to amuse himself from the beginning.. Also I think Wade admires Evans more than his own son does, and he maybe felt, 'A' for effort – the guy deserves to win a little.Ben Foster as Charlie Prince blew me away, again even more the second time around. He bursts onto the screen, turbocharged, and just takes over the film. Simply riveting. A TV actor? No way! One scene and I want to watch everything he's done. He inhabited that character. Crowe and Bale are both absolutely superb and leave nothing to be desired. This movie made me a Russell Crowe fan all over again. Peter Fonda also shines as Byron McElroy, the hard-as-nails Pinkerton guard. Kevin Durand was good in this as well, though his character was rather one-dimensional.Ben Wade was the most richly developed character: the level-headed, wise, enigmatic outlaw – ruthless, yet sensitive enough to draw and read and be a sweet-talking' lover. Wade is not evil; he claims he is, but even the boy sees this is not true.The Dan Evans character was bitter and so intense. Stubborn, with the kind of stubborn pride that will get you killed. He wasn't doing it just for the money, and even justice was debatable when you figure all the good guys that got killed so that this one bad guy could get on that train. Mr. Butterfield was also very stubborn, as was Byron.Will is the young son, on the accelerated track to manhood. Outwardly he idolizes Wade, but inside he already has all the best parts of his father.Charlie was more a caricature than a character. But uncontrollable and psycho as he was, his adoration ensured complete loyalty.It was an outlandish plan from the get-go (even if they somehow miraculously could succeed in getting him on the train, wouldn't Charlie and company then just go after the train?). Things really started to go downhill toward the end, and there are so many things I would change, but the suspense was wild, and in the end everyone got what they wanted I think. It's hard to find a good ending that perfectly resonates, and this was a good one in theory; if they had made the odds less impossible and tweaked it in a few other places, it could have been a great one. You never know if things like that could be the result of an executive decision by one person holding the purse strings, and I decided not to let that ruin the whole movie.So enough redeeming stuff for an overall win: able direction, an authentic feel to the sets, some pretty funny lines, plus all the stuff mentioned above, but worth it for Ben Foster's performance alone. It was movie-making on a grand scale – the kind that leaves you changed after you come back down into your life, feeling invigorated the next day and giving you something to think about.",9,0,0,23 February 2014
Just Go with It," Crudely Charming
","Silly and juvenile is not really my type of humor, but I loved it anyway. If it wasn't enough that the whole plot premise was far-fetched, they had to throw in a bunch of ludicrous situations and ridiculous dialogue. Still, it wasn't as silly and juvenile as you would expect for a Sandler film.I tend to eventually see everything Jennifer Aniston does – I suppose because I keep wanting to see her prove wrong the naysayers who claim she always plays the same character. And in this I thought she was terrific. She was the rock – the voice of reason, and independent. Not just some breezy shallow character.In The Switch, much as I like Jason Bateman, the chemistry just wasn't there. And in The Bounty Hunter Aniston seemed way too focused on trying to look hot rather than her acting. But here her acting was solid and the chemistry good.I enjoyed watching Sandler do some acting rather than only his usual zaniness. I actually thought he was great in this.Even Brooke, who I was sure I would hate, did a decent job. Nicole not so much - maybe she hasn't yet conquered comedy, but it was excellent to see her not taking herself too seriously. That's an example, I think, of an actress doing something not for the money. And the kids were not bad. I could have done without the Eddie character altogether. Just too over the top.All too often lately I see movies where 2 people fall in love and it doesn't make sense -- you can understand why the one person loves the other, but not vice versa. In Just Go With It, though, both of these characters were likable and deserving, and you wanted them to get together. Just as Devlin says, these 2 had an obvious connection. There was a kind of electricity, and a tenderness.Although Sandler doesn't have any writing credits, I get the feeling half of this was improv. I haven't seen the stories it was based on, but I imagine it is far removed from either of them.I don't recall laughing out loud a whole lot, but I definitely was smiley and happy throughout the whole thing. at the end I was literally clapping.All in all, a good time. I don't usually watch a movie more than once, but I've already seen all of this at least twice, and a few of the scenes I wanted to watch over and over, hence the high score.",8,0,0,8 September 2015
Hugo," Missing the magic
","I was expecting to be a little enchanted. It just didn't seem plausible the whole thing could be based on this man's horror at having ended up a failure. The obstacles seemed manufactured. Why couldn't he have just told the man he got the book from his father, and it was all he had left of him? Why couldn't he have just told the guard he was keeping the clock running? There seems to be more truth behind this story than with even many historical movies – at least the sci-fi film part. And I don't think I would call it Steampunk; everything that happened seemed to be in keeping with the time period. The acting didn't thrill me, either. A lot of sustained shots of people's faces quivering. which is hard. The station and camera work were pretty.",5,1,2,25 August 2015
2012," Follows the laws of cartoon physics.
","Remember how Wile E. Coyote always lived even when he fell off a cliff, or got run over by a train? This was about that ridiculous. The John Cusack character should have died 83 times in this movie. All I kept thinking about was how well it would lend itself to one of those 'Everything Wrong With 2012' video commentaries. The last time I remember a movie being this implausible was Speed, and it left a bad aftertaste that's never faded. But that was at least an enjoyable flick.Faster than a speeding bullet, more invincible than Evel Knievel, John Cusack's character has a knack for jumping chasms and being at the right place at the right time. Through luck, magic, miracles, superpowers, whatever, he makes one incredible split-second escape after another. This device is tremendously abused, not just in how close the calls are, but the sheer number of them.At every turn, something goes hopelessly wrong (beyond just the natural disasters). But even that doesn't stop the charmed Cusack from coming out of it alive (by the skin of his teeth). And with people dying all around him, every single one of his family makes it. Every falling fireball misses them...every time they pull away in a vehicle or plane, a gorge opens up exactly where they need to go so they have to jump it. Over and over and over and over. There is no relief from the ridiculousness.The pinnacle of ridiculousness is this scene: As soon as John Cusack finds the map that will save his family, a huge chasm opens up in the ground, and John naturally falls right into it. BUT – never fear – he manages to grab onto the edge in the nick of time and pulls himself up...still holding the map in his hand!!! Is this Emmerich guy an adult?? I understand he wants to take us on a nonstop roller coaster ride, but... If they would simply have made the earth open up a few meters away, instead of a millimeter, or they could make their getaway by a few seconds, instead of a quarter second EVERY TIME, it would still have been suspenseful, but plausible enough to not make you want to scream at the screen.Their plane (since the charmed Cusack is on it) glides effortlessly between falling buildings. It's the end of the world and they're seriously low on fuel -- why do they never dump the weight of all those excess autos? But...they continue on their hopeless journey. In the end, they only made it because...their destination had shifted! What luck.I saw the ship plowing into the White House in the trailer and thought I was in the mood for a big disaster flick, so I picked up the DVD in the bargain bin.The FX were grand as you would expect or could hope for, and the acting was passable. The problem was with the script. The dialogue, the characterizations and the plot -- all dreadful. I cry pretty easily, but it was very hard to feel anything for any of the characters in this movie. Except maybe Danny Glover. They tried to make jokes but they weren't funny. Only Woody Harrelson's character was somewhat interesting.The thing about selling tickets to the arks was played up as some terrible fault in humanity, but really – how else were they going to get the money to build them? The governments of the world all cooperate quite civilly in the face of this impending catastrophe that would put men at each other's throats. They've gotta kill anyone who figures out their plan...yet they're not worried about any of the people who bought tickets leaking the info? Like what if someone declined the offer because they didn't believe the world was going to end? Oh, maybe they were killed as well? In the wake of the Japanese tsunami, one has to wonder with all the nuclear plants and toxic chemical stores how doomed they would really be no matter what..Right up to the end, as the every-man-for-himself mentality would have been peaking, the plot did not let up on its ludicrousness. As the arks are taking off, forget that the clock is ticking and every second counts...forget that there will not be enough food/supplies and everyone on board could die and this all will be for nothing...Chiwetel's impassioned plea convinces every world ruler to let everyone on at the last second.And it ends with a lame love song...And now I will happily part with this DVD.",3,1,3,15 March 2014
The Holiday," It's a chick flick and I'm a chick, but...
","I had strong recommendations on this movie from 2 friends, one of whom has totally opposite taste from me in everything, and the other of whom has the nearest taste in movies to me of anybody I have ever known. And I do tend to enjoy rom coms so I thought I would definitely like this. Have never liked Diaz but I love Kate Winslet, and Rufus Sewell was in it so that was the clincher.There was one laugh-out-loud scene, but if you're going to see this flick and haven't watched the trailer yet, don't. It gives it away plus it's funnier in the movie. There is also a cute line by Jack Black as the unlikely romantic co-lead (and I'm not talking about that scene in the bar – ugh).A lot of people seem to think this is a good movie to see during the holidays, and they watch it every year along with the actual Christmas movies, saying it's warm and family-themed, but I don't see it. I don't even remember it being very holiday-oriented.It all just seemed too unlikely -- other than simply because ALL FOUR OF THEM were on the rebound -- that these people would fall in love with each other so quickly and easily.What was so great about the Amanda character that someone would fall in love with her? She slept with him right away which is supposed to be a relationship killer. (Incidentally Diaz looked revoltingly skinny in the bathtub scene, as though her arms were badly Photoshopped thinner.) She seemed mostly pretty shallow. It is telling that she doesn't even seem to realize her neighbor is this old film legend, and it is never even mentioned in her phone calls with Iris. And in the end she was not really giving up anything to be with this man – he seemed to be pretty well off himself.What was the point of making everyone so rich? Particularly Amanda -- obviously it was so important that the filmmakers spent a million just on the set of her house interior alone. It really made her seem like she didn't have too many problems! Or that even if she did, you could hardly feel sorry for her. At any rate, you could not identify with her.Even the less fortunate Iris had an incredible quaint country cottage. A 'fairytale English cottage' like that would probably be out of reach of most ordinary people.Jude Law did not seem natural playing a sweet guy. I got the sense he had a disdain for the role (as well he should have).James Franco and Lindsay Lohan are 8 years apart in age, yet he plays her father. That's just for a silly subplot, so I guess it doesn't bother me so much.The only part of the movie that seemed believable and real was the story of the unhealthy relationship between Iris and her coworker. Though even that seemed far-fetched when he intended to continue it even as a newlywed.I'm really trying hard to figure out why so many people like it, however I just don't think I can bring myself to watch it all again.No screen magic going on here.",5,1,2,11 August 2014
