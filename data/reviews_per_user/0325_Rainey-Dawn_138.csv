Saturday Night Fever," More Than Disco
",Saturday Night Fever is more than just a group of people dancing at the local disco-tech! The movie really focuses on Tony Manero's life - who he is and what he wants. Tony wants more out of life than a typical 9 to 5 dead-end job. He's growing more and more tired of the same hum-drum mundane lifestyle that he lives day-in and day-out. He's even growing out of his friends who seem to want things to remain the way they are. Tony's focus: His Dancing. Could he ever make it as a professional dancer? I will not give away all the juicy details of the film - I recommend watching it for yourself if you have not already seen it. I will highly recommend this movie and the second film 'Staying Alive' for viewing if you have any interest at all in professional dancing - particularly if your have your eyes towards Broadway.10/10,10,0,1,23 June 2014
Vertigo," Great Mystery-Thriller
","Vertigo is a really good suspenseful mystery-thriller. It really is one of Hitchcock's finest films. This is a must see film for all movie fanatics and mystery lovers.As far as Hitchcock films are concerned Vertigo is not my favorite of his movies (Psycho tops my list) but I do agree that Vertigo is one of the best Hitchcock films. The cinematography is really good as well as the script. The actors (most all are well known) gave outstanding performances for Vertigo. Sure the movie has some flaws - but that is true for most all films. If you liked Vertigo then you might like movie like: Psycho, Sleuth, Rear Window or Murder On The Orient Express.8.5/10",8,2,4,18 October 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," More Adventures of Sparrow and Barbossa
","The 4th installment of the PotC series gives us another sea adventure featuring Sparrow and Barbossa. Will and Elizabeth are not in this film instead we are introduced to two new characters and rivals of Jack Sparrow: Angelica and the notorious Blackbeard! This movie, IMO, is not quite as good as the first two films but still had me captivated by it's story. It is a refreshing change, twist, to the series. All in all, PotC: On Stranger Tides is well worth watching. Sparrow and Barbossa tend to be the core characters in the series and they will not leave you disappointed with this adventure.8.5/10",8,0,1,17 October 2014
Alien 3," More Action, Less Story
","'Alien 3' follows the character Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) into an action again as she falls deeper into the the world of the aliens she has grown so familiar with. She begins to become more militant and less like her old self because of everything she has gone through (see the first two films). Ripley's inner strength is stronger than ever and her determination is more powerful in the third installment of the franchise.'Alien 3' is a good movie I do like it - yet, for me, the movie franchise has grown more in the direction of action and less in focus on the storyline. It's a great film for action movie lovers but not so great for those of us wanting more mystery added to this story and the entire franchise. *In reference to the first film of the series 'Alien'.7/10",7,2,2,30 June 2014
Gremlins," A Cute Family Comedy-Horror Film
","I was about 12 years old when Gremlins first came out... I recall seeing it on the big screen and loved it! Back then, I wanted one like Gizmo - and I have a strong feeling other kids had a similar wish about the cute and cuddly little creature.I have recently re-watched this movie and I was quite entertained by it after all these years. What I found most humorous is idea that you should not feed them after midnight -- what about timezone? Are these little guys able to know the difference? LOL.Gremlins is a very fun movie. In my opinion, Gremlins is a family comedy-horror film - it's good for all ages.I will have to rate this film 7.5/10 -- for the cuteness.",7,0,1,13 October 2014
Antz," A Wonderful Animation
","A wonderful delightful animation. A good solid story and lovable characters. A great film for the entire family.Antz takes us deep inside the the anthill into a tyrannical world filled with blood, sweat and tears. The character Z is growing more tired of the mundane and brutal ways the colony and dreams of a colony that is happier (much less grueling) and more lenient with greater productivity. Believe it or not, this animation has a great lesson to teach while maintaining it's comical merit.If you enjoyed Antz then I would recommend the following films: 'A Bug's Life', 'Madagascar' and 'Monsters, Inc.' 9/10",9,1,1,23 October 2014
10 Cloverfield Lane," The Film Is (John) GOOD Man!
","Yes this is a good movie! I'm not into most of these newer films - most of them are just not 'me' but this is a pretty darn good movie.I don't wanna give it away to first time viewers but the movie is as it's described: Michelle awakens after a car crash in a locked room, chained to a wall. Howard comes in to let her know he's saved her and she can't leave, aliens or another country have attacked the USA. She find that another person is with the two of them, Emmett. Howard will not let Michelle or Emmett go - it's dangerous, the outside air is contaminated. Michelle is growing more afraid of Howard but is Howard telling the truth? Has WW3 broken out or did Aliens really attack? What is up with Howard? John Goodman is just awesome in this film - his best! Let us not forget how good John Gallagher Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are in this one. A very intense & claustrophobic atmosphere!9/10",9,0,0,7 May 2017
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I Want To Go Home With E.T.
","I saw E.T. (1982) when I was 10 years old - and for a long while after watching the film I wanted a space alien for a best friend just like Elliot had. I thought it would be so cool to have a secret friend not from planet earth. Just think about what I can teach and show him about earth, likewise, what the creature could show and teach me! I remember at the end of the movie I wanted leave planet earth with E.T. - and is most likely the reason why as an adult I would still love to 'fly away' with space aliens (E.T. along with the aliens from 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind').As an adult I think E.T. is one of the greatest family films ever made. The movie E.T. is funny in places and a bit scary in some of the scenes. It's very cute and an all around good sci-fi fantasy family picture show that most people can enjoy.Note: E.T. was originally going to be a sci-fi horror movie but was changed to the family film we know today.8.5/10",8,2,3,30 June 2014
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Wacky Rabbit
",Well Roger Rabbit is a humorous film and I did like it but not as much as I used to. I find Roger Rabbit a bit to wacky - as if the character is overly exaggerated trying to hard to be funny. Jessica was a bit 'over the top' but sexy looking. And I hated Baby Herman - he really got on my nerves.The best thing about this film is the piano duel between the Donald and Daffy. That is something I wanted to see when I was a kid - some sort of duel between the two hot-headed famous ducks. My childhood wish came true with Roger Rabbit's film - so I will not knock this movie all that hard.If you liked Roger Rabbit then you might like similar films 'Space Jam' or 'Song of the South'. 7.5/10,7,0,1,23 October 2014
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," A Doggone Cute Film
","This is a very cute Disney film crime-mystery classic animated film. The story is not bad - it's pretty interesting. And Cruella De Vil really is a vile character because she wants the puppies to make a Dalmatian fur coat - I will admit she is a cool looking toon and sometimes funny with her anger but she is definitely one of Disney's most villainous characters - she tops the most evil list.Some reviewers are not fond of the animation (the actual artwork) in 101 Dalmatians. I personally like the art in this film - it has a dark or mysterious look and feel to it - so it's perfect for the story.The only thing I felt was missing from this movie was some catchy songs like most of Disney's film animations. This movie needed some jazz to spice it up just a bit (IMO).Want to make it a double feature? Try other Disney classic animated films like 'Lady and the Tramp', 'The AristoCats', 'The Jungle Book' or 'Dumbo'.8.5/10",8,1,2,24 October 2014
Minority Report," Everyone Should See This Film
","I had seen this film before, forgot about it for some reason, then on a radio talk-show I was reminded about the film again. I watched it again and recalled seeing it before. This is one of those film I had forgotten the name of and had to be reminded.The talk-show was about a real life version of the film Minority Report which is a subject of fascination to me. The movie Minority Report is a very important film - one everyone should watch.Could we actually stop a crime before it is committed? Is a wo/man guilty when they have not actually committed a crime? Is thinking about harming someone an act of crime when they are only thinking about it? What if a person was planning on committing a crime but changes their mind - are they still guilty? (More questions come to my mind but I will spare you from them.) The idea of a crime-free society has been around for who knows how many centuries... and the movie Minority Report is about the very subject! Chose your side: 1) A crime-free society where everyone's private thoughts (including your own) are known to the police - all your thoughts! OR 2)A society where there is crime but you and everyone else will keep all of your thoughts private unless you choose to tell someone or act upon them.This is a must not miss film!! The film maybe a real life future for our society.10/10",10,0,0,25 June 2014
Finding Neverland," Not Bad
","In 1903, in England, the play writer J.M. Barrie has a complete lack of inspiration, and his last work was a deceptive play. When he meets the children of the widow Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, he becomes friend of the family and Sylvia becomes his muse and her children the source of inspiration. James writes the successful play about 'Peter Pan and Neverland'.",6,1,2,20 December 2017
Finding Neverland," Peter Pan Story
",Finding Neverland is an amusing drama about how the story of Peter Pan and Neverland came to be. During a writing slump play writer J.M. Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her three children who soon become an important part of Barrie's life and the inspiration that lead him to create his masterpiece 'Peter Pan.'8/10,6,0,1,17 December 2017
Underworld," Dark, Mysterious & Marvelous
","What an extraordinary film! When I first saw the previews for this film I knew I would like it but when I watched this film, it was love at first watch! Dark sets, mysterious characters and a marvelous well acted out script makes this film stand out. It is a good, solid story. Lots of action to enjoy and a highly interesting plot. Within this story is a beautiful 'forbidden' romance that will have you swooning.If you have not seen this film - I would recommend doing so if you are a fan of horror (especially if you enjoy lycans and vampires).9.5/10",10,3,5,15 October 2014
Lords of Dogtown," Not My Style of Film
","To be fair about this: I skimmed though the film and it not my 'style'. BUT the film looks like a good film for those that like surfing, skateboarding, biographies or for a fan of Heath Ledger (RIP).From what I saw of this film - I think it's a good biography if you are interested in the story of these guys, the Z-Boys. I for one am not interested in surfing or skateboarding but that does not mean this film is bad - that just mean it's not a film for me.I acquired this film in a Heath Ledger film pack and I have nothing against the film, the cast, the Z-Boys or anything else - it's just not my my type film.5/10",5,1,3,9 September 2016
Seven Years in Tibet," An Interesting Film
","I have never read Heinrich Harrer's book so I have nothing to compare the film to and no way to know to what degree the film has been fictionalized. So I have to rate this film as 'a dramatized or fictionalized biographical film'.I saw this movie when it first came out in 1997. This is actually the last movie I have ever seen in a movie theater. (Yes it's been that long since I have been to the theater).This is one of those movies I liked better than I thought I would - it was better than the previews lead me to believe. I thought the movie was actually good. It was heartwarming, a bit adventurous, and quite an interesting story.My rating is based on 'just a Hollywood film' and not on if it is a perfectly accurate account or true to the book.8/10",8,0,1,21 October 2014
12 Monkeys," Much better than I ever expected.
","This is a movie I figured I would like - but did not think I would like it as much as I do. The movie is well worth watching if you are into time travel.I'm not sure what I liked best about the film: The humor, the action, the twists, the idea of a criminal rescuing humanity, or the idea of time travel itself. Maybe its a bit of all of it because 12 Monkeys has all of this.The way this film is made, you can actually keep up with what is going on even though there is travel in time happening - not like some time travel films where you can't tell where they are or where they have been half the time. The film is well made (and well written) so you can easily follow what is going on. This is a film that fans of time travel, science fiction, action, and comedy-dramas is sure to enjoy! 9/10",9,1,1,25 June 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A Great Follow-up Film
","PotC: Dead Man's Chest just as good as the first film (simply said). The story takes us deeper into the world of Jack, Elizabeth and William and sails the audience out into the stormy seas where we meet the character Davy Jones and his cursed crewmen. Squid-faced Davy Jones' look is enough to give anyone the heebie jeebies but his sinister ways are even scarier which gives the movie's story it's core.This is another great family film but if you or someone you know is a bit squeamish then you may want to pass on this film. The movie is not all that bloody nor gory but does have a gross-out factor with Davy Jones and his crew.9.5/10",9,0,1,17 October 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Great Film
","Disney has made quite a number of great films and the entire Pirates of the Caribbean is no exception. PotC: Curse of the Black Pearl is lots of fun. It has plenty of action for eye-candy and lots of comedy to keep everyone laughing. It's an adventurous tale, with a great fantasy story to follow. The entire cast seemed to really outdo themselves for this film... they appeared to give it their all for this outstanding movie, each one played their roles believably. This is a movie the entire family can enjoy.This movie would be a great double feature with movies like 'The Mask of Zorro', 'Hook' or even followed by the second film of the PotC series 'Dead Man's Chest'9.5/10",9,0,1,17 October 2014
Beauty and the Beast," Nice Disney Classic
","Another beautifully animated Disney film concerning a Princess finding her Prince. This is a good story concerning enchantment and romance that is great for the entire family. It is a dramedy (comedy-drama) so a lot of adults can enjoy the motion picture not just the kids. Beauty and the Beast is a story similar to that of Cyrano de Bergerac - a male that is not so handsome but a beautiful lady falls in love with him. (See the film: Roxanne). Great companion films to Beauty and the Beast: 'Cinderella', 'Sleeping Beauty', 'The Little Mermaid' and 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.9/10",9,1,1,25 October 2014
Public Enemies," Surprisingly Good
","Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger's charm and audacity endear him to much of America's downtrodden public, but he's also a thorn in the side of J. Edgar Hoover and the fledgling FBI. Desperate to capture the elusive outlaw, Hoover makes Dillinger his first Public Enemy Number One and assigns his top agent, Melvin Purvis, the task of bringing him in dead or alive.Very surprised with this one - one of the best Depp crime-dramas.9/10",9,0,2,13 December 2017
Madagascar," Comical Escapees
",Madagascar is a very cute film about escapees from a zoo. They head out on an adventure of their lifetimes and learn what it is like to live life in the wild. The team of escapees are a bit 'uptown' or domesticated in comparison to their wild distant relatives - which adds more to the humor.The movie is great from the start and kept me laughing throughout the film. This is definitely a good family comedy.If you liked 'Shrek' or 'Ice Age' then it is a good chance that you may like Madagascar as well.8/10,8,1,1,23 October 2014
Alexander," The Accents In The Film Are NOT The Problem
","What do you expect the actors to speak? In the Greek tongue with real ancient Greek accents? There are many films of this nature that are filmed in English, no matter the accent. Be it American, British, Welsh, Irish we all speak English with different accents. I cannot understand all the complaints about the accents then rating the film low over it. Clash of the Titans, Antony and Cleopatra, Gladiator, etc... all speak in an English accent and language. To bash this film (Alexander) over accents makes no sense what so ever. So the accent and language complaints of this film are completely invalid.The idea is to tell us an entertaining story in movie form and the film makers did that quite well with Alexander. I like this film. I realize it might not be 100% accurate but none of the films of this nature are because none of us were there to really know exactly what was said, who said it, what they did and and didn't really do.Overall I found the film quite entertaining, it gave me an idea of what it might have been like during this time period and how it might have been with Alexander the Great.7.5/10",7,2,4,17 January 2017
The Mummy," Thrilling and Comical
","The Mummy has enough trills to keep you on the edge of your seat and enough comedy to keep you laughing. This movie is full of action, excitement and adventure. Beautiful costuming and sets - most elaborate. The story is just awesome.Every time I watch this film I want to go back in time to the days of Ancient Egypt. I am always entertained when I see this movie - it's a favorite of mine.I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that has not see it and I do recommend following it up with 'The Mummy Returns'. 8.5./10",8,2,2,15 October 2014
Troy," The Action Is Entertaining
","Whether or not the stories of Troy and Helen are true is debatable. I for one think that maybe there was a Troy once upon a time but I do not believe the myth that any battle took place over a woman called Helen. That's just my take on the legend. As far as the film goes, it pretty good. I look at it as Hollywood cinema and that is all; no differently than in the way I view Clash of the Titans - Hollywood telling us their version of a Greek Myth.The action of the battles, costumes and sets are what grabbed my attention and not so much the story itself. There are a couple more versions of this tale in film form that tells us the tale a little differently. This particular version of the story is fine but I really like the eye-candy of the costumes (no matter who are wearing them, I like them). And I like the battle scenes and this film started out with a with a loud BANG.Yes I like this film, it's enjoyable - especially the costuming eye-candy (and I know that's shallow - and I'm NOT speaking of actors but the period costuming and battles - I love it).9/10",9,1,1,17 January 2017
Ed Wood," Not A Bad Biography
","The mostly true story of the legendary 'worst director of all time', who, with the help of his strange friends, filmed countless B-movies without ever becoming famous or successful.Not an accurate account of Bela Lugosi nor Ed Wood - but close enough to enjoy. It's not a film that pure Lugosi fans will enjoy.8.5/10",8,0,2,13 December 2017
Chicken Run," Barnyard Escapees
","A cute comedy drama film about barnyard escapees! The film *almost* has a film noir look and feel about it similar to an old black and white crime-thriller. Maybe the filmmakers did in fact make this movie a subtle film noir deliberately due the nature of this film or maybe it's just my perception.I was able to bust-a-gut laughing at times during this movie - other times the movie felt like a good animated drama playing out on the screen. It does have an air of suspense and mystery about it so it's not your typical animated comedy.This film is definitely worth watching if you liked flicks like 'Madagascar', 'Monsters, Inc.' or 'Antz' 9/10",9,0,0,23 October 2014
Home Alone," Not the Christmas Classic I Was Expecting It To Be
","Home Alone is a very cute, lighthearted comedy. Kevin McCallister definitely has a way of detouring the criminals in a very comical way. This movie is a good family type of a film - so I do recommend watching it for those that have not seen it and love funny films.On the downside: Home Alone is not the Christmas classic I was expecting it to be. After watching the movie a couple of times I realized that this movie would not be among my favorite Christmas films to enjoy each year. Maybe I got the burn-out watching it. You would think I would love Home Alone each year because I still enjoy the comedy film Christmas Vacation during the holidays and I'm not burned out on it but Home Alone I am.6/10",6,0,2,25 June 2014
The Jungle Book," Extremely Hilarious
","The Jungle Book is one of my favorite films from my childhood. I still literally laugh out loud every time I watch this movie. This is my favorite version of the story because it's too funny and all the characters are likable - even the evil Shere Khan I like.Mowgli is a cute 'man cub', quite a brave little boy especially to stand up to Shere Khan and Kaa. Bagheera - Is a lovable panther. He's a well grounded, down to earth, sensible character type - but he knows how to have fun too. A very enduring toon. King Louie is just insanely fun, so are his band of monkeys. I love their catchy tune 'I Wanna Be Like You'. I am like Baloo, 'Oh man what a beat'. 'I'm gone man - solid gone'. Yes it's a groovy little tune.And Baloo is the best - 'Bare Necessities' all that jazz. I would love to have a (cartoon) bear friend like him because he could liven up any boring day - just like this Disney classic film: The Jungle Book.Simply worded: This film rocks! It's outstanding and memorable.If you like this movie then I would recommend Disney's 'Robin Hood', 'Fantasia' and 'The AristoCats'.10/10",10,2,4,23 October 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Good 3rd Film
","PotC: At World's End is a good film, 3rd in the series. I can say, to me, that is was not quite as good as the first two films. Each of the well known characters seemed to be a bit more bizarre, 'out-there', to me. Maybe it's because they have gone through so much in (as we saw in the first two films), maybe it's because of where they currently are and their situations as the 3rd movie picks up? Whatever it is, all of the characters seems to act very strangely in this 3rd film installment - or maybe it's just my own personal perception.PotC: At World's End is well worth watching and a must see for fans of the film series.8.5/10",8,0,1,17 October 2014
Sleepy Hollow," An All Time Favorite!
","'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' has been one of my favorite stories since I was a kid. I recall having the story read to me and seeing Disney's classic version of the tale in the 1949 animated 'The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad'. Needless to say, when I saw the advertisements for Tim Burton's take on the story I had to watch it and, to no surprise, I fell in love with Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow'.The movie is full of Victorian Gothic imagery -- and, as someone mentioned, it has a bit of 'steampunk' thrown in to the mix which really adds to all the wonderful imagery in the film.The movie is an exciting mystery which is 'peppered' with some (Tim Burton) humor. A very thrilling movie to watch on a dark and stormy night while all the lights are off.This movie is one of my all time favorite films ever! 10/10",10,2,3,13 October 2014
Silent Hill," Mediocre Horror Film
","Not a great horror film - but not too bad. It's your standard modern day horror-thriller without a lot of thrills. For me, the only reason to watch the movie is for the beginning and ending with Sean Bean - outside of that it's just mediocre. 5/10",5,1,1,4 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Wonderful Ending to a Trilogy
","In 1983 I was 11 years of age and still a fan of the first two films in the Star Wars saga! I could not wait to find out what happened Han, Luke, Leia and the rest of the rebels! I watched this movie with eager eyes and enormous curiosity to find out the rest of the story. Needless to say, I was not disappointed in the third installment.The Empire Strikes Back has a wonderful story that ties up all loose ends from the first two films - and has just as much of an action-packed adventure as New Hope and Empire Strikes Back! This is a wonderful ending to the original trilogy.Brilliant casting, sets and acting in this fun filled sci-fi fantasy! A must see for anyone that loves science fiction.10/10",10,0,2,23 June 2014
Alien," An Eerie Sci-Fi Film
","Still one of the creepiest movies in the sci-fi horror category and that deals with contact with space aliens. It is suspenseful, dramatic and mysterious.'Alien' is the first movie of the film franchise - and, to me, the best in the series. It is the story of how the group of astronauts (most notably Ripley) came into contact with the bioform/alien. The movie has action in it but not nearly as action-packed as the second movie in the series 'Aliens'. I find that the first film (Alien) is a good story.This is definitely a movie for all that love the concept of space aliens and horror films but is also good for mystery lovers as well.9/10",9,2,4,30 June 2014
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," I Enjoyed The Film
","This is an outstanding film. I have to say the stage plays and earlier films have escaped me for years... so this Tim Burton adaptation is the first time I've seen or heard the story of Sweeney Todd. I still don't know how the earlier films have eluded me but I'm planning on trying to find a copy of the 1936 film starring Tod Slaughter as Sweeney Todd because I know I'll enjoy it: I like the story and Tod Slaughter.I've read and heard that some have complained about this version remaining a musical but I for one enjoyed the songs and singing. We do not have very many musicals in today's films and I'm glad this particular film remained a musical.This film is scary, sad and, well, bloody. There is plenty of on-screen terror to fulfill most any horror fan.Good entertaining horror. I quite enjoyed the movie.9.5/10",9,0,0,9 November 2015
The Doors," Not Perfect but Great Fun
",This movie is not perfect - there are a small handful of things added to the film to make a fun 'rock music film'. There are however quite a number of things that really did happen that are added to the film - most of the things in the movie really happened (as I mentioned just a small handful of things that didn't happen in reality).As far as the casting goes I think everyone was great. This is the film that got my attention towards Val Kilmer - I never really paid much attention to him as an actor before I watched this film for the first time a few years ago. Kilmer really did a great job at portraying Morrison. He did his best and pulled it off well in my book.I don't view this movie as 'the gospel' of The Doors band but I enjoy the film as simply a fun rock movie film with some true to real life events. If you want to see a great documentary on The Doors then I recommend 'When You're Strange'.9/10,9,2,2,29 March 2016
Black Mass," Good Crime Drama
","The true story of Whitey Bulger, the brother of a state senator and the most infamous violent criminal in the history of South Boston, who became an FBI informant to take down a Mafia family invading his turf.A pretty good film concerning Mafia families - The Godfather, Serpico, or even Donnie Brasco would make a great feature to go with Black Mass.8/10",8,0,3,11 December 2017
Underworld Awakening," Somewhat Disappointing
","Out of the 4 Underworld films, Awakening is the worst. Awakening is a good film but there are a couple of things that makes this one my least favorite and somewhat disappointing to me: One thing is Michael is not in the film and the first two films built Michael up to be a very important hybrid. Another disappointing thing is that the story lacks quite a bit -- it's just not as interesting as the other films (even with an added element: a daughter by Selene and Micheal). I also disliked the 'super lycan' - that was just a bad (bunk) idea to me. Don't get me wrong Awakening is worth watching but it's just not as good as the first three films. Maybe I was just expecting something else from this 4th installment and that is why I was somewhat (but not completely) disappointed with this film.7.5/10",7,2,2,15 October 2014
Full Metal Jacket," The Horrors of War
","Full Metal Jacket is one of the scariest war films to date - it is just as creepy as any well made horror film! This movie is not for the faint-of-heart! It is graphic in it's depiction but well made in the fact it defines the horrors of war without being too vulgar with it (which kept it from being an X-rated film).Outstanding performances from the entire cast, an excellent storyline and it's very much action-packed for those seeking thrilling war action.This is one of those 'must see' films for movie connoisseurs.10/10",10,0,1,23 June 2014
Corpse Bride," A Creepy Classic Animation
","A very good stop-motion animation. Well worth watching - great for the Halloween Holiday. Fun for all ages.I think what I liked best about the film is the uniqueness of the story - it is quite different than any other story I have personally heard of, read or seen. The twist to this 'love triangle' is the fact that Victor is still alive, his beloved Victoria is alive and Emily is a corpse.Of all the characters in this film - it is Emily I feel bad for. She was murdered by her fiancée then (gently) rejected by Victor. In the end Emily finds peace.A good film to double with 'Frankenweenie', 'The Nightmare Before Christmas', 'ParaNorman' or 'Hotel Transylvania'. 8.5/10",8,1,1,13 October 2014
Forrest Gump," One of the best romantic films made!
","I am not a big fan of the romance genre generally speaking because I get my romance in side-stories in other film types like sci-fi, action, adventure, fantasy etc. But when the movie is labeled 'romance' as a main theme then I usually will not like it... most of the 'romance' films are icky chick-flicks *ewe*! I usually need more to make the movie interesting. Forrest Gump is one of those rare romance films that I thoroughly enjoyed! All I can say is 'Jenny, you fool! The right man for you has been there the whole time for you and you simply do not want to admit it! Sure, He isn't that smart yet he's smarter than all the men you have dated combined! Go back to Forrest!' And that's all I've got to say about that! 9.5/10",9,3,4,25 June 2014
"Monsters, Inc."," Lovable Monsters
","This film showed me what my childhood 'monster under the bed' really was doing and acted like when it was not trying to scare me. (Just Kidding).Monsters, Inc. is one of the best animated movies and so much fun to watch. If you ever had a 'monster under your bed' or 'in your closet' when you were very, very young then you may get quite a few chuckles out of this film and while bringing back some comical childhood memories.On a personal note: I view this film as an animated comedy-horror due to the fact it's about (bed or closet) Monsters.If you enjoyed animated films like: 'Shrek', 'A Bug's Life', or 'Ice Age' then Monsters, Inc. is a movie that you should enjoy.9/10",9,0,1,23 October 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fantastic Fantasy Film
","No other way to word it: It's a fantastic fantasy film! This is almost the book brought to life - almost. What we have in the film is the heart and core of the book well written & acted, beautifully filmed. Choreographed to perfection. The sets, filming locations and the costuming are drop dead gorgeous. The screenplay / story is outstanding.I have nothing but good to say about this film - all I can do is brag. I *think* J.R.R. Tolkien himself would be very well pleased with this movie. It may not be perfect - but no movie is exactly perfect and this one comes close to it.Yes I highly recommend this film to fantasy film lovers. I'm sure most everyone has seen this film already - but I am long past due to brag... err hummm... write a review, even if it's just to brag.10/10",10,0,0,4 March 2016
Man of Steel," Not A Super Movie - But A Pretty Good Watch
",This is not as Super as the Christopher Reeves Superman films but it is a pretty good superhero movie to watch on the comic book hero Superman.They do go fairly far in-depth about Superman and his history - it's more of a look at Superman's family and personal history to me than a film that is all about his adventures and heroism on planet earth - at least that is what I got out of the film.It's one of the better modern superhero movies to me. I liked the slightly different take on the Superman story.Christopher Reeves will always be my movie Superman - but this one it pretty good.7.5/10,7,0,1,10 April 2016
Grease," A Fun Light-Hearted Romance Flick
","This is a great film that highlights the many talents of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Both of them are good actors, dancers, singers and has charm - simply adorable together! The rest of the cast are just as great as the two leading characters which brings the film to elevated heights. It's a great film that all movies lovers should watch.The movie has a groovy soundtrack - and well sung by the cast. I still love to listen to the theme song 'Grease' by Frankie Valli.The Rydell High School seniors will have you in stitches laughing at their shenanigans and comments to one another. But the real focus of the students becomes focused on the budding romance between Danny and Sandy. Rizzo is a bit jealous of Sandy and will try to rip them apart while, Frenchy is more than willing to play cupid to help her best friend Sandy win Danny.A good film to watch when you are in the mood for light-hearted comical romance movie.9/10",9,0,1,30 June 2014
Footloose," A Good But Severely Underrated Film
","Footloose is a good film period! I was 12 years old when Footloose came out and watched this one several times throughout my teen years. I still liked this film after re-watching it as an adult.This seems to be a movie you either hate or love with very little in-between reviews or thoughts on the movie. I think it's rated way to low on IMDb.Maybe some people really don't get the message of the movie?! There are real-life people that think all rock music should be banned - that is reality! Some people really do feel that rock music is a bad influence and want ALL OF THE YOUTH - in particular their own kids - to be influenced by other things: religion, country music and living, classical music or anything else they can come up with. And it's the same with the joy of dancing - some people find dancing to be outright vulgar and want others to stop dancing! YES this film is based on reality! Maybe the people that dislikes this film so much sides with the idea of 'NO ROCK MUSIC' thus, hated the *idea* that Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) brought rock-music back to the town as well as the pleasurable activity of dancing.Maybe some people just dislike Kevin Bacon and will bash everything he does - including this movie - instead of judging each of his works by merit. (I've personally known people that dislike Bacon and has bashed him for everything).Yes folks, there still are people in the world that think that all rock music and dancing should be banned for their own reasons. Wolfman Jack fought this same issue in his own way. The movie 'Footloose' fights back with a great story and wonderful film. 'Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution. Rock and Roll it will survive' - AC/DC.9/10",9,1,3,30 June 2014
The Thing," A Creepy Alien Film
","John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing' is one of the scariest science fiction films dealing with space aliens that I have ever seen. The story itself is creepy enough but Carpenter's vision created a memorable horror film out of the story.The first thing that one notices is the element of icy isolation. The group of scientists are in the cold desolation of the Antarctic and loose contact with the civilized world. - That in itself is enough to scare the daylights out of most people.The second thing is the thing. An alien life-form that cannot be seen, is not ghost-like, yet it's presence is well known.The third thing is the suspense and mystery. A mystery of how the creature lives and survives. And the suspense of who is human and who is The Thing! This is a long time film favorite of mine and I do recommend it for those that love aliens stories mixed with horror.On a personal note: I when I look at spiders I sometimes think of this film - the character of Vance Norris (Charles Hallahan).10/10",10,1,3,30 June 2014
The Village," A Different Kind of Horror
","When I saw the advertising for the movie I thought 'wow this looks pretty good' and then it came on TV one night - I had to watch it. The movie is better than the previews had me thinking it would be. A wonderful film.The Village is not a visual hack-them-up gore-fest like Saw (for example) nor is it a ghost story, it not a creepy-kid horror film and it is not a monster movie. Instead The Village is good story - within the story lies a horror which is plausible. The movie is a group of people wanting to get away from all the bad things in mainstream modern society and go back to a simpler, more peaceful way of living - or so they thought - and that is where the horror lies... away from modernism.The entire cast was wonderful in this movie! The costumes and scenery are beautiful. And the story, the story is haunting - a must see different kind of horror film.Personal Note: I think the movie is underrated on IMDb. And it's one of my all time favorite films.8/10",8,2,3,27 June 2014
The Orphanage," One of the Best Horror Films of the 2000s
",If you are looking for a good Gothic haunted/ghost story you've found it here - and it's one of the best horror films of the 21st Century. There is not a lot of blood and gore to see here - look elsewhere for that; this film is subtle horror with a couple of jump scares here and there to keep you on the edge of your seat at times.Well worth watching this beautifully filmed classic.9/10,9,2,2,20 April 2020
The Shining," Seriously Dramatic and Twisted
",The Shining is not a typical hack-them-up slasher film nor it is a simply a ghost/haunted place movie - it is a combination of both in a roundabout way. It's a must see for film connoisseurs and horror movie buffs.The movie is so well acted out by the cast. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance so well that you almost believe that he is that psycho in real life - he's so convincing in this movie! Shelly Duvall was outstanding - I felt like she captured the emotions and torment of Wendy perfectly.The movie has spawned satires and jokes since it first grazed the silver screen in 1980 due to it's popularity. But the movie is not a comedy - no joking matter - it is a seriously dramatic twisted horror film that is not easily forgotten.10/10,10,2,4,30 June 2014
The Patriot," A Good Film Despite Inaccuracies
","Films like this one are hard to review because most all of them, if not all of them, have inaccuracies. History films are quite a bit misleading. They are not movies based on accuracy but fictional stories surrounding real people, places and actual events - so this easily throws off the audiences, leading them to believe that a History film is historically accurate when it is not. These types are just a movie and not a history lesson.The film itself is good. Has an interesting story, good characters (and the actors playing them), great visuals, good effects, beautiful cinematography, super sets and costumes etc... everything needed for a good movie - it's just not historically accurate (like other films in the History genre).7.5/10",7,1,3,9 September 2016
Edward Scissorhands," A Wonderful Film
",Edward Scissorhands has become a film classic and a favorite to watch around the holidays (Christmas/Yuletide) for many people. It's a very nice story of a scientist and his 'son' Edward. Edward was not completed before his father-creator died so he is left with scissors for hands.Peg sales Avon and ends up going to the home of Edward. She has a bleeding heart for him and brings him back home with her to live. Ed falls in love with her daughter Kim but Kim's boyfriend is extremely jealous and mean towards Kim as well as others... this causes friction in the community.The movie is a light-hearted romantic comedy-drama (dramedy). It's colourful and dark at the same time. It's just an all around good movie.Note: This is Vincent Price's last significant film.8.5/10,8,1,1,9 November 2015
Van Helsing," Action Please!
",I don't care what the critics say I LOVE THE FILM! Van Helsing is a good fantasy horror film - an action-packed adventure! The action in the film is worth watching even if you are not keen on the plot of this movie. I for one thought the story was very nice and a great Gothic atmosphere! I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the vampire-hunter Van Helsing - he was cool. Hugh Jackman is well suited for this role! And he picked the perfect romantic interest Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale)! One of the highlights of the film is the romance between Anna and Van Helsing.This film is great to watch on an day when you are in the mood for the classic movie monsters and a lot of action! 8.5/10,8,6,11,25 June 2014
Face_Off," A New Twist To Stolen Identity
","Something about this film is scary - in fact, completely terrifying! Although not a horror film it could *almost* fall into that category. The thought of identity theft is creepy - there is no telling what a person could or would do if they stole your identity right down to your face! Yes I do love this movie and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good sci-fi, drama and/or crime film. The movie does put a new twist to the old concept of stolen identity - worth watching! A good prime time film to watch when you are in the mood for something thrilling and different.9/10",9,1,2,27 June 2014
Aliens," Terrorizing Action
","'Aliens' is an action-packed movie and not a bad sequel to the first film. This one has Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as a gun-toting female 'Rambo' who is bound and determined to get rid of all of these particular species of aliens that tends to terrorize all that come into contact with them.I actually prefer the first film of the series 'Alien' because it is less action and more suspense but the sequel 'Aliens' is quite entertaining. I found the idea of horror changed between the two films. The first one, 'Alien', the horror lies in the element of the unknown then facing it. Whereas the second movie the horror lies more in the action, the idea of facing death and the death of others. -- Just an opinion.8/10",8,1,2,30 June 2014
The Exorcist," Still Packs A Punch!
","I've got to say this film still packs a punch! It can still send shivers up and down my spine when I watch it - and it's not the head spinning or the pea-soup that gets to me - it's when the demon first starts to take her over that is the most frightening to me. Regan and her mother are both confused, the doctors are trying all they can think of to help and she's a 12 year old girl - that is the most frightening to me!! Once the priest is called in it's not as scary to me anymore (it was just the opposite for me when I was a teen lol). It's not only the daughter I feel for but her mother as well... not to mention those that died for a cause: to remove the devil from Regan.Great cast! The special effects still hold up today, super scary story and just a fun scary movie to watch! It's still an impressive film! Overall this film is still excellent! It is still one of my favorite horror films... it's a classic that I hope to enjoy over and over again for the rest of my life.9/10",9,0,0,12 October 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Nothing Like Harry Potter - Just the Same Universe
","J.K. Rowling's universe is quite magically fun but this movie is just okay - not great, not horrible - mediocre. If was young again I'm sure I'd like the movie a bit better than I do as an adult. I do recommend this one for the younger film audiences - lots to offer them. As an adult, the story is rather bland and a bit too simple, not all that interesting. 6/10",6,1,1,28 August 2018
The Butterfly Effect," A Mind-Blowing Film!
","This is a film that was recommended to me that I did not think much of at first I sorta blew off for the time being. I ran across the film one day and decided 'what the heck I'll watch it'. I had zero expectations about the film, really was not sure if I would enjoy it or not. Well, I more than liked the movie - I was totally blown away with it! The Butterfly Effect is a mind-blowing film! It will have you thinking, guessing, rethinking, and re-guessing throughout the movie. This is another film that you may have to watch twice to fully 'get it'. It's a very odd film but so good! I recommend watching this movie without any distractions - it's very detailed and if you miss something then you are lost! 9.5/10",9,1,2,27 June 2014
No Country for Old Men," Odd Title, Good Film
","No Country For Old Men is one of the most exciting Crime Thrillers I've seen in a long time if not, THE MOST exciting I've seen in years. The movie sent several chills tingling down my spine and I was on the edge of my seat through most all of the film.The title of the film struck me as odd! So odd I didn't think I'd ever remember the name of the film - but I did after repeating it over and over to myself so the movie would not become a 'good but lost film' for me.If you like Crime-Dramas and Thrillers then look no further than this film. It's even creepier than most horror films.10/10",10,2,3,25 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Exciting Film
","This 2nd Hobbit film is an exciting continuation of the first Hobbit film - lots of action to go with the fantasy and adventure in this installment. I loved it! After Gandalf leaves them behind for another quest, Bilbo, Thorin and the rest of the Dwarfs end up coming face to face with the wood-elves king Thranduil, his son Legolas and Tauriel - after escaping the clutches of king Thranduil, Bilbo and the dwarfs meet a bargeman called Bard who smuggles them into Laketown - some scuffing goes and and they finally reach their destination: The Lonely Mountain. Meanwhile, Gandalf goes to Dol Guldur - Sauron's keep in Mirkwood to find out if the enemy (Sauron) has indeed come back to take over Middle Earth. Gandalf is held captive there and watches helplessly as the orcs descend on Lake Town at the foot of the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo tries to gain the Arkenstone from the dragon Smaug but awakens him... the dwarfs and Bilbo now have their hands full and the film ends with Smaug the dragon heading to Laketown for revenge.10/10",10,1,4,10 September 2016
Days of Thunder," A Film for Race Car Fans
",If you love NASCAR and/or Tom Cruise then you are sure to love this film. It is a sports (NASCAR) drama - it also has romance and a lot of action with a pretty good story too.I personally don't think this is Tom Cruise's best film nor his best work but it is a movie that will keep you entertained - even if you are not a big race car fan.I never figured I would like Days of Thunder - but I did enjoy the film (similar to the way I never dreamed I would like Jerry Maguire but I really enjoyed that movie too).7.5/10,7,1,2,21 October 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," And So It Begins...
","A wonderful way to being the tale and journey of Bilbo Baggins. This film is the beginning, the way Bilbo began his adventures & acquired The Ring.This film is begins the story of Thorin Oakenshield the dwarf King of and the rightful king of The Lonely Mountain. He, along with his band of dwarfs, Bilbo and Gandalf set out on the journey to help Thorin regain his throne and bring back the glory of The Lonely Mountain. Of course this group will encounter goblins, trolls, orcs and wargs but will have a little help along the way here and there from others. In the end of the film they can see The Lonely Mountain - their destination.I have to say the soundtrack to this film is outstanding... the dwarven songs really stand out!! Everything about this film worth watching, worth owning just like the original trilogy Lord of the Rings.10/10",10,2,6,9 September 2016
Saving Private Ryan," A Beautifully Sad War Film
","A Beautifully Sad War Film - almost sounds like an oxymoron because there isn't anything beautiful about war yet a film like Saving Private Ryan shows the rare beauty in humans in times of war.The movie seems to be heartfelt by all the actors because each played their roles so emotionally - as if the movie was their reality. I guess that is what makes a great actor, they tend to experience or act out very well real emotions while making a film.The ugly reality of war is seen throughout the movie and is heart-pounding action during those scenes.The ending of this film will bring a grown man to tears... in fact, anyone to tears that has a heart.9.5/10",9,1,2,25 June 2014
The Little Mermaid," A Good Disney Film
","A good family film with a cute version the story. As it is written so it is said, Disney's movie is *loosely* based on Hans Christian Andersen's story - so you cannot compare Andersen's story with Disney's film. Disney's film is a colorful tale with quite a few comical characters.I enjoyed this film quite a bit but I would have liked to have seen this movie a bit 'darker' in tone (animation and story). Under ocean is a mysterious place - so I would have preferred this movie with more of a 'gloomy' atmosphere and story instead of being mainly a bright place to live. Of course it's just a matter of personal preference.Yes The Little Mermaid is a wonderful film. You could make this a double feature with movies like: 'Sleeping Beauty' or 'Beauty and the Beast'.8/10",8,4,4,25 October 2014
The Number 23," Numerology Madness
","I watched this movie out of a few curiosities: Jim Carrey in a dramatic role, the occult theme, the movie poster, it's a psychological thriller and I read somewhere that this move was good. Well I found the movie to be a pleasant surprise - I really enjoyed the film! The movie has plenty of twists and turns as Walter Sparrow becomes more and more obsessed with the Number 23 - it's numerology madness at it's finest! There are many people in the world that become obsessed with numbers and sometimes delve into the world of numerology due to their obsession - so the movie is NOT that far fetched at all! On a personal note: I really liked Jim Carrey's performance in this film and I wish he would do more drama - he's very good! 8.5/10",8,1,1,27 June 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Still Incredible
","The second film did not loose any steam... instead it keeps building. No matter how many times I see these movies I still get the same thrills that I did at first viewing.This film is a bit dirtier, grittier than the first film... due to the war torn areas and great battles involved. CGI used for a lot of these scenes but not misused.. which is nice. I'm kinda picky about CGI and Peter Jackson's films are always done in good taste - never abused.Like the first film, the 2nd film leaves you craving more - which we get in the 3rd in the series 'Return of the King'. I can say that for movies that are around 3 hours in length - the films seems short to me... the time goes by so quickly when watching.Another film I would highly recommend for fans of High Fantasy.10/10",10,1,3,4 March 2016
The Mist," Good For Modern Horror
","This one is a pretty good modern day horror film. Interesting, intense at times and sometimes some of the things that happen are sad. I agree with others that if the CGI had more money put into it then the film would be even better, but then again it's a good movie as it is.I can only imagine being trapped somewhere with several different personalities during a frighten event! And that is what's going on in this film - several are trapped inside a store when The Mist arrives. Lots of arguing about what The Mist is or isn't and that leads to the intense moments between the people trapped inside. The worst person of the bunch is an insane holy roller that ends up turning some of the people to her side of the fence.Can anyone escape The Mist? What is it? Where did it come from? You'll have to watch to find out - I'm not going to spoil it for first time viewers! 8/10",8,0,1,30 October 2016
The Elephant Man," A Beautifully Sad Film
","In memory of Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890).The movie is Joseph Merrick's story who became known as The Elephant Man. This is one of the saddest movies I have ever seen and yet it is so good. My heart goes out to Merrick - he had to endure so much in his life.The Elephant Man is filmed in black and white - which is perfect for the film. The black and white gives the viewer a feeling of being a much older film than it actually is. It also has a feeling of being a classic horror movie - which works perfectly for the story because Joseph Merrick's condition is horrifying yet his story is so beautiful, touching and sad.A great film.9/10",9,6,7,27 October 2014
Shrek the Third," Pretty Good Third Film
",The story of Shrek the Third (2007) is not quite as good as the first or second films but the comical lines and visual comedy is still right up there with the first two movies.Some of the new characters are not quite as enduring and memorable in Shrek 3 but they are quite likable and entertaining.The animation in this 3rd installment of the film series is still awesome.All I can really say is I enjoyed this 3rd film. And I do recommend it if you enjoyed Shrek and Shrek 2.8.5/10,8,5,7,23 October 2014

Caddyshack," Comedy At It's Funniest
",This is such a wonderful comedy. At the time this movie came (1980) there were some funny movies but Caddyshack may have been the King of Comedy films that year. The only other comedy film that was could have stolen the crown of comedy in the year 1980 from Caddyshack was the movie Airplane!. Both movies are superb! Caddyshack does contain some of the funniest lines and sight gags that you will ever see. I never knew that golfing could be so much fun! Yes Caddyshack is worth watching - it's an older film but it is a top-of-the-line 1980 comedy classic. If Caddyshack does not get you laughing out loud then I do not know what other film would.10/10,10,0,4,27 October 2014
Shrek 2," A Funny Sequel
","Just as funny as the first movie - one of the best sequel films ever made. A lot of the time, a film's sequel (in particular comedies) will loose some of their appeal, luster, charm or humor - but not Shrek 2. Nothing was lost in this wonderful sequel. This twist on the fairy-tales we grew up with will leave you with a bellyache from laughing so hard.The entire voice cast was great in this movie. The script was well written and utterly humorous. The animators are topnotch too. The characters in the film are just, well, 'cool' - very likable.The introduction of Puss in Boots really added a flare to the story along with added comedy. I can see why he got his own (spin-off) movie.9.5/10",9,2,3,23 October 2014

","I really did not think I would like this film - at all in fact. When the movie first came out to rent, my (now ex) boyfriend suggested we watch the film - he told me I would really like this movie. I said 'ok' so during our dinner date we watched Jerry Maguire (I was reluctant and kinda turned up my nose when the movie first started). Well, by the time the movie ended I was thinking 'Wow! The movie was actually really good!'. Well, I have to say I had to eat my own words about this movie - it's actually worth watching and I did like the movie more than I was ever anticipating - it's not boring.Jerry Maguire is good sports dramedy (comedy-drama). The film might surprise you as it did me.8.5/10",8,2,3,21 October 2014
Clash of the Titans," Variety is the Spice of Life
","I will not bash this film based on being different from the ancient myths anymore than I will bash the 1981 version of the tale. These films draw inspiration from the ancient stories - not a carbon copy of the original Greek stories. This 2010 film is also not a carbon copy of the 1981 film, just like other 'remakes' they have changes to create a variant instead of exact duplicates. Duplicate films are redundant and pointless while variants of the same story creates variety - and variety is the spice of life.With all the above being said, I like this version of the myth. Myths are simply stories and stories entertain us. Variants of stories are good, it's nice to see our beloved ancient gods and goddesses in a bit different way.No this film is NOT exactly like the original myth, but neither is the 1981 version. I prefer the 1981 over the 2010 but I do like this 2010 version.6.5/10",6,0,0,17 January 2017

","This remake of the classic tale about Charlie, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is just as dark, fun and twisted as the book (written by Roald Dahl) and the original film starring Gene Wilder ('Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory').Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great family fantasy film that is filled with delicious looking movie sets, vibrate costumes and great special effects. The acting is wonderful - each actor brought to life the strange characters from the colorfully written book.If you have not read the book by Roald Dahl then you should - you may appreciate the efforts put into this film. Also follow up the book with the second book 'Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator'.I will have to rate this film 9/10.",9,3,5,13 October 2014
A Bug's Life," A 'Buggy' Film
","This is one of Disney's best Pixar films. It's extremely cute and comical with a great story about 'A Bug's Life'. This is a humorous peek inside the life of bugs that is good for all ages.Hopper is very much a drill-sergeant figure in this film. He's funny yet a bit dislikeable - not the kind of guy you would want for a boss or manager that's for sure.Flik and Dot are as cute and lovable as they can be. Heimlich is a scene stealer - one of the funniest toons in the movie.The rest of the characters are great as well - so you are in for a fun time when you watch this 'Buggy' film.Good companion films: 'Antz', 'Ice Age' and 'Madagascar' 9/10",9,0,0,23 October 2014
Hotel Transylvania," A Highly Entertaining Animated Film
","Hotel Transylvania is a very cute family film - I quite enjoyed watching this! The movie captured my attention from the beginning and kept me entertained to the very end! The story itself is cute and interesting while the comedy in it kept me laughing.I have to admit: I was not fond of the music in the movie but I do have to remember it is geared for the modern day kids. Being an adult, I would have loved to have heard some of the older (creepy) rock music but it was not necessary for me to enjoy this film.All in all - this movie is well worth watching even if the music in it is 'not your thing'. (There is not a lot of music in the movie either). This one should become a Halloween classic along side of Frankenweenie, Corpse Bride, The Nightmare Before Christmas and ParaNorman.I will have to give this movie 8.5/10. (Rating would have been higher if I would have liked the music).",8,0,2,13 October 2014

It is also a movie that all movie connoisseurs should see - the film is a classic.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a movie I can watch again and pick up something different with each viewing.On another note: The movie's theme by Alex North is one of the best and most memorable film scores... it's just as much of a powerful classic as the film itself.10/10,10,1,2,2 July 2014
Toy Story," Not As Good As I Was Hoping
","This is another one of my 'I should like this movie better than I do' films. It has an all-star voice-over cast (which I like all of them) - and that is the merit to this film and the story is cute and fun. I did get a few laughs out of the movie so I will not knock the film.So what is it about the film I dislike? The toys - not the actors voicing them - the toys themselves. All of the toys except for Rex (the T. Rex toy). I did enjoy the toon Rex - he was quite the comedy act. Mr. Potato Head was OK in the film but I never liked the toy as a kid - just boring to play with. The rest of the toys (or similar types) never interested me as a kid so they do not appeal to me in this film.It's a shame that I am not keen on this film since I really enjoyed films like 'Monsters, Inc.', 'Shrek' and 'Chicken Run'.6/10",6,2,7,23 October 2014
Men in Black," Awesome Sci-Fi Action
","One of the best science fiction action comedies ever made. The special effects are great - believable (realistic) instead of being cartoonish. The story is interesting - and it's easy to get pulled into it from the beginning. And there's plenty of action and comedy to keep you watching. It's one of the best films of it's kind.If you enjoyed Men in Black then there are a few other comedies with science fiction themes that you might enjoy as well: 'Mars Attacks!', 'Spaceballs', and 'Galaxy Quest'.If you like the quirky CIA/FBI in Men in Black then you might like similar comedy films dealing with laughable governmental/police characters such as 'The Naked Gun', 'Spies Like Us' or 'Dragnet'.9.5/10",9,1,1,27 October 2014
Puss in Boots," Two Paws Up For This Film
","This film gives us the back-story on Puss in Boots. It is a good film based on fairy-tales (or should I say fairy-tails) that will have you laughing like a kid again.Kitty Softpaws - Loved her! When I first saw her I thought she was a he like Puss did. 'Bat Cat' was my first thought.... then I said to myself no it is a she 'Cat Woman' lol. Well I like the name Kitty Softpaws and the character. She's lovable.Humpty Dumpty - I did not know if I liked him or despised him until the end of the film. I decided that he is a likable egg. Very funny character - just as funny as Puss.Puss in Boots - Funny, adorable and charismatic as usual (See: Shrek 2). I'm glad he got his own spin-off movie. Well worth watching.9 Paws out of 10!! 9/10",9,3,4,22 October 2014
Alice in Wonderland," Delightfully Fun
","Burton-Carter-Depp trio once again pleases. The film is better than it should be -- I completely enjoy it with every watch.The story is very much similar to the 1951 Disney Cartoon (minus musical numbers but the 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Bat' song). Basically, if you enjoy the famous trio and love fantasy (Disney) then you should like the film - if you haven't seen it yet then what are you waiting for? The usual: Sets, costumes, blending of colours, good story, great cinematography etc... and well seasoned cast really makes the film worth while.9.5/10",9,0,0,10 December 2017
The Mummy Returns," Just As Good As The First Film
","IMO, The Mummy Returns is just as good as the first film (The Mummy). The Mummy Returns has just as much action, adventure, comedy and thrills as the first in the series. The costuming and settings are beautiful -the script/story is good too.I realize that there are people who feel the plot is a bit weak in The Mummy Returns in comparison to the first film but judge that for yourself - I found I enjoyed this movie just as much as the first one.I say make this movie a double feature: The Mummy then follow it up with The Mummy Returns.8.5/10",8,2,3,15 October 2014
Avatar," A Reality Soon Enough
","Pretty cool sci-fi action fantasy film.A good story if you follow it from the beginning of the film. Basically a huge corporation tearing down large amounts of inhabited forest/jungle. The natives of the beautiful Pandora will do anything to protect their planet from being destroyed.As far as avatar's go I find the subject very interesting! Research the topic of real life avatars! There are interesting online newspaper articles on the subject like 'Real-world beaming: The risk of avatar and robot crime' and 'Russian billionaire reveals real-life 'avatar' plan'. Yes it will happen one day, maybe sooner than we think that makes the movie 'Avatar' more realistic than most people realize.The movie 'Avatar' is good - if you have not seen it yet I recommend that you do - it is the future waiting to happen.8.5/10",8,1,4,25 June 2014
A Clockwork Orange," Truly 'Ultra-violent'
","One of my all time favorite films. As a teen I had the original soundtrack on vinyl - which is wonderful! I had a small movie poster of the film, the movie on VHS and a hat just like Alex DeLarge! Alex has always been the character that I love to hate and hate to love! A Clockwork Orange is an artsy futuristic crime thriller! I've always said this movie one of my favorite 'horror films' (because of the nature of the film).The movie is narrated by non-other than Alex DeLarge himself! His narration brings you a bit closer to the character because you feel he is talking to you (and anyone watching with you) directly - more so than any other narrated movie I've ever seen.Alex and his gang of droogs are vile, nasty thugs! They steal, rape, murder and wreak havoc anywhere and to whomever they please. The gang leader, Alex, is the worst - he will even hurt his own friends/gang members.If you have never seen this movie and would like to I will warn you ahead of time that it is truly 'Ultra-violent'. It is a fantastic movie with the idea of 'curing the criminally sick' at the heart of it called the The Ludovico technique.10/10",10,1,4,25 June 2014
From Hell," Interesting Tale
","This film is an interesting spin on the story of Jack the Ripper. It will be up to the viewer if they agree somewhat, completely agree or totally disagree with what happened, how it happened, who Jack the Ripper was and his connections.What really happened during the rein of terror from Jack the Ripper remains a mystery to this day. Police and hobbyist are still trying to solve the case to this very day. It's interesting when people come up with a new theory of what happened and who Jack was.Now, watching this movie as 'purely Hollywood cinema' and not from a point of historical accuracy the movie is good, to me. There is some very scary scenes - quite horrifying really. The movie has a good story even if it's not quite accurate and has some flaws it's still a good horror film over all.8/10",8,1,1,9 November 2015
National Treasure," Fun Adventrue
","This is a movie that others tried to get me to watch for a long time - I finally recently watched it for the first time. I found it to be a really fun adventure film.The only part that bothered me was the ending. They got away with bribing stealing the Declaration of Independence while Sean Bean and his group got arrested - everything was blamed on them. Cage and his group would have still done things illegally regardless of Bean and his group. But a really a good family film, I enjoyed it. 8/10",8,3,3,7 September 2018
Pulp Fiction," A Bit Over Rated But Good
","I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to it's hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like it's the only movie worth watching - like it is the 'King of Films'. Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.7/10",7,2,5,27 June 2014
The Da Vinci Code," Not As Good As I Heard It Was
",Well I know this is a work of fiction and it show clearly. It's way to fantastic of a story with our only decedent and 'princess' - which I already figured out in the beginning when she walked on screen. Not a big surprise to me and I'm sure not a big surprise to others. The holy grail of Arthurian Legend and bloodlines.The film is not nearly as 'earth shattering' as some make it out to be nor is the film completely horrible hogwash as others claim it to be. It's a work of fiction not claiming to be reality - nothing wrong with that.I liked the film - it was just to easy to guess the ending. But it was an interesting ride to the end. Would have been better if the answer as to who or what the holy grail is came out of left field in the very end instead of easily guessed at the beginning.6/10,6,0,0,17 May 2016
Titanic," Not As Good As I Was Hoping
","Titanic was not as good as I was hoping it to be.... I was disappointed in the film. I want to like this film because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I like him - he's a great actor! But I could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on. I was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but, alas, it was not so.The casting and acting was quite good! The set was realistic as well. There are good moments in the movie so I can't knock it completely.IDK, maybe I will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than I actually did the first couple times I viewed it. Or, maybe, I really did want a modern documentary type of movie on The Titanic.I hate to dislike this film but I do. It's a movie I should at least like better than I do but I do not. I have to rate the film low due to the fictional romance the film was focused on.6/10",6,2,5,25 June 2014
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," AKA Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone
","I'm finally in a position to re-watch and review the Harry Potter film series - I'm way past over due for reviewing them.First of all, I don't know of anyone that has not seen at least one Harry Potter flick. Everyone seems to agree that these are great films - I am no exception.Secondly, the entire series is highly entertaining! If you haven't seen this series then I highly recommend you should. Comical, magical and all around fun to watch.This first film starts out with a bang as when Hagrid, Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall show up with baby Harry Potter on the doorstep of Harry's relatives home. The film ends on a good note with the house cup being awarded. In between the beginning and ending is non-stop entertainment.Great to watch this film again9.5/10",10,1,1,19 May 2020
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Really A Cute Film
","I really don't know what more I can say that other reviewers haven't said already - it's a really cute and fun film!In this one, Harry finds his life and the life of his friends in danger. He and his wizard buddies must find the Secret Chamber in order to put an end to the chaos and petrifactions going on in the school.Great family film.9.5/10",9,0,0,20 May 2020
Psycho," Norman Is Not Normal
","I am not one that is into most slasher type of films but the 'Psycho' film series has a very good interesting story and main character (Norman) from the first film to the very last movie. I love these movies.Psycho is most definitely a horror classic - I doubt most people would argue with that. It is a must see for those that love horror but have yet to view the film.Psycho is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen in my life and I am not just talking about the infamous shower scene. The entire movie had an air of mystery and thrilling suspense from start to finish which added more to the horror, more than the shower scene.Even if you never knew that Norman was a 'Psycho' killer the character would still seem bizarre. Norman seems normal when you first meet him on film, yet the more he speaks the more he seems strange, just weird when he talks - that alone is enough to scare the pants off of you! Then you factor in the fact he is in fact 'Psycho' on top of it the movie becomes one of the all time scariest films ever! No, Norman is not normal.10/10",10,1,2,2 July 2014
The Witch," I Am Blown Away - Intelligent, Suspenseful Horror
","One of the biggest problems with most modern day horror films is the fact they spend more money on fake blood and guts than they do paying good actors, directors, writers, etc. Most of the modern horror films are the stupid in-your-face blood, guts and gore with a crappy or non-existent storyline. And they do not know how to build up suspense and create subtle, intelligent horror. This modern day horror film, The Witch, is quite the opposite. The Witch is highly suspenseful, very atmospheric, excellent story and over all scary.The film is considered to slow to some people, and I can see why... it's not the silly chop them up film that they are used to. The Witch is in the spirit of good classic horror... slowly building into a terrifying ending to a fantastic story. It's about a very religious family in the 1600s who's child came up missing, their crops failing, intense family moments and witch nearby in the woods. Very creepy things happen to the family.If you like the subtle, suspenseful, eerie horror films - then watch this film! I am blown away at how good it is. I fell in-love with this film the first time I watched it - and it's rare for me to enjoy modern horror but I truly enjoyed this film. 9.5/10",9,4,9,30 October 2016
Rosemary's Baby," More Than A Newborn Child
",A creepy class horror film full of mystery and suspense. A must see for those that enjoy movie surrounding evil religious cults! It's not a slasher film - it is a good horror story classic! The scariest part of Rosemary's Baby is the fact that Rosemary's life is being ruined and completely controlled by others for their own wicked purposes. Rosemary cannot even get help from the police or other professionals (like a psychiatrist)... for one thing her story is unbelievable and the other problem is they are a part of the scheme; for you see there is something special about Rosemary's Baby - something more than just a newborn child.10/10,10,1,3,27 June 2014
Ice Age," A Worth While Animation
","One of the funniest animated films I have seen and yes it is worth while watching. A cute story, comical characters, great animation and an all around good comedy.I loved all the characters but I will admit it: Scrat is my favorite toon in the entire film. To me, he was the most comical with his sight gags. I've never witness such humor in hiding and eating nuts but Scrat managed to get a quite a few laughs out of me with is nutty ways.If you like animated comedies then give Ice Age a view - you are sure to get a few giggles out of this cute film.8/10",8,0,0,23 October 2014
Bram Stoker's Dracula," One of the Better Film Versions of Dracula
","To be honest, I have never read the book so I am judging the film like any other film and not comparing it to a book. But from what I hear this film is closer to the book than other Dracula films.I have to say the movie is solid. Really good script - well acted out by a fantastic cast. Costuming and sets are lavish - very nice! The one thing that stands out to me are the special effects... I don't feel the film misused any of the special effects, instead they only enhanced the film as special effects should. It's important to me that special effects are not misused or overused.Overall this is a great film. If you are looking for a good vampire movie and have not seen this one yet then I do recommended it.9/10",9,0,3,29 March 2016
Jaws," Still A Good 'Mammoth-Sized' Fish Story
","I have to say this film is still good to watch all these years later. It's a good out to sea movie that can leave some people afraid to get into the ocean waters! Great acting by all involved, well filmed as well - plenty of action to watch on the screen and not just with the shark attacks - lots of character interactions that are fun and sometimes intense to watch. The story is good as well - for a horror movie it's really good.I still enjoy watching this movie - I remember it from my childhood so it's a part of my growing years of watching movies.9/10",9,4,6,2 September 2016
Dark Shadows," Not Grand But Funny And Enjoyable
","I'm finally getting around to review this one. The film is a cute tongue-in-cheek comedy horror. I will admit, I do wish they would have made the film a pure horror instead but I did enjoy the comedy in it so I won't complain to much about it.There is a great cast, a Gothic charm, some rather weird scenes that is enjoyable. Story is fine and it's well filmed. But it pales in comparison to the TV show which was a drama and not comical.Yes I wish this film took itself seriously and it was a pure drama (that's why I didn't rate it higher) but the Burton and Depp dark comedies are to much for me to resist so therefore, I'm giving it a rating I think is fair enough.7/10",7,0,1,19 January 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Great Ending To A New Beginning
","This final installment of The Hobbit brings us to the battle with Smaug in the city of Laketown. Many have died in the fires of the great dragon and Bard puts an end to Smaug and becomes a legend in his own right.Bilbo and the dwarfs are inside the halls of the old dwarf place with Thorin. Thorin has caught the dragon sickness as his forefathers - just like his grandfather. He's going mad and there's nothing Bilbo and the dwarfs can do but stay by his side, loyal to their vow to Thorin. Out the great dwarven keep the elves gather outside ready to deal battle with Thorin and his 12 men - the tension is building.Gandalf is freed from his prison, he along with Radagast, are sent way - Gandalf tells Radagast to gather all the animal armies he can to send to the battle forthcoming.

Radagast shows up with the Great Eagles in the end but also in the end Azog and Thorin manage to kill each other. Thorin's last breathes he and Bilbo confirm their lasting friendship as the Great Eagles soar overhead. A sad day for all - many lives lost.And so it ends but it begins a new time for Middle Earth, a time when Saurman and his Nazgul will search for the One Ring... a little gold magical ring found by an unlikely person Bilbo Baggins.10/10",10,2,7,10 September 2016
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Some Day My Prince Will Come
","Another wonderful 'damsel in distress' film animation from Disney! This movie is right up there with Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. I still love this movie after all these years.The seven dwarfs are cute, comical and each of them as cuddly as a teddy bear - including Grumpy! Without the comic relief of the dwarven the movie would be a good drama.Snow White has all the inner and outer beauty that a person could hope for. She's cheerful, helpful, charming, polite, friendly and fun. Quite a nice character.Queen Grimhilde is the picture of all vanity. She wants to be the only beautiful woman in the kingdom. She is quite beautiful on the outside but she lacks the inner beauty that Snow White has which makes her more angry and jealous at Snow.Prince Florian is a dashing and daring guy who has his eyes on the beautiful Snow White. Prince Florian is another 'Prince Charming' and our hero of the film.Yes this is a great Walt Disney classic that should be seen if only once in you lifetime.10/10",10,5,5,26 June 2014
The Lion King," Walt Disney Would Be Proud
","This is an outstanding Disney film that Walt Disney (the man himself) would be proud of. The Lion King is a good solid story with fun songs and very likable characters. It is one of the funniest Disney animated films ever made. The movie does have some very sad moments as well but it is mainly a good comedy. It's a film that is well suited for the entire family - not just the kids.If you like The Lion King, try these Disney classics out for size: 'The Jungle Book', 'Bambi', 'The Fox and the Hound' or 'The AristoCats'.I would also like to plug: The Lion King 2 and The Lion King 1 1/2.10/10",10,0,0,24 October 2014
The Cannonball Run," A Funny Cross-Country Adventure
","This movie is reminiscent of Smokey and the Bandit: We have Burt Reynolds, a cross-country run, car chases and wrecks, an-all star cast and cheesy funny comedy.The bonus to The Cannonball Run is in fact the all-star cast which actually 'made' this film work so well. They are all very funny in this film. If you like Smokey and the Bandit then you may enjoy The Cannonball Run as well - both are similar and quite fun to watch.This is a great afternoon 'popcorn' film - this is not the kind of film that provokes any deep thought - it's just pure fun comedy. All you have to do is kickback and enjoy! 8.5/10",8,4,5,21 October 2014
The Conjuring," It's Worth A Watch
","Take a haunted house film, add a Satanic witch, splash in a possession and pepper it gently with Hitchcock's 'The Birds' and you'll get 'The Conjuring'. Not a bad blend - worth watching if you like possession and haunted house films.It was a bit over the top at times - particularly towards the ending. I wasn't overly impressed with the film but it was kinda fun overall.6/10",6,0,1,8 July 2019
Halloween," A Thriller - Not A Gore-Fest
","Halloween (1978) is one of the best slasher movies ever made. It is not a modern day gore-fest with the notion of 'let's use all the fake blood we can find to put on a film and call it a horror movie.' because it is quite the contrary. Sure, Halloween (1978) does have it's moments of blood but it is not a gore-fest.So what is Halloween (1978) if it is not a typical slasher gore-fest? The answer is that it is a thriller and it is the thrills that brings out the horrors of the movie. Things like Dr. Loomis in desperate search of Michael because he is the only one that really knows the seriousness of Michael loose on the streets - the chase is thrilling! Another scare factor is the idea of a murderer quietly lurking in the shadows watching someone's every move as they go on about their own business then suddenly on the run from the killer and trying to find a safe place to hide.Michael Myers' life story is interesting - just as interesting as Norman Bates 'Psycho (1960)' - and just as horrifying!On a final note: It just goes to show you that you don't need multimillions to make a good quality horror movie - just some imagination and good writing skills.10/10",10,0,2,3 July 2014
Carrie," Still Good All These Years Later
","A timeless horror classic - it's very much a must watch for fans of the genre. This classic with Sissy Spacek is THE version to watch, I'm not into the remake at all.For those who have not seen this one yet and love horror - you'll just have to watch it because I won't give it all away. I will say that Carrie is a girl with a mother that is overly zealous in her religion and has raised Carrie in it - making Carrie weird to others and they make fun of her for that. Carrie also has Telekinesis - a mental power that she uses only when she feels forced to use for her own protection.A really fun watch. It's just to bad those who are picked on don't develop Carrie's powers for their own personal revenge in real life.8.5/10",8,1,1,8 September 2017
Blow," The Biograpy of the Cocaine Drug Lord George Jung
","You would never believe that the story of a drug lord could be so interesting but it is. While the film may not be 100% accurate it is a fairly good depiction of the life of George Jung.The story tells the tale of Jung's childhood, how his family became flat broke, how and why Jung decided that drugs was to be his way of life and Jung's rise to the top of drug world as well as his downfall.The movie has quite a bit of action, a good biographical story to tell, intense drama and a good casting. I enjoyed the film very much and do recommend it to not only fans of Johnny Depp but to those that are interested in biographical films and crime-dramas.8/10",8,1,1,9 November 2015
1408," A Little Bit Disappointing
","1408 is a pretty good psychological horror thriller but the ending of the film kinda let me down. For me: It was a great suspenseful, thrilling film all the way up until the very last when it kinda went overboard with everything in the room. Maybe I was just expecting a very different type of ending to the film? That is quite possible too. At any rate, I was left disappointed with the films finale.The movie IS worth watching if you enjoy psychological horror thrillers! I personally loved this film up until the very ending. Just because I wasn't happy with the ending does not mean others would not be pleased with it.8/10 (Would have rated it higher - if the ending was a bit more appealing to me).",8,0,0,18 October 2014
The Woman in Black," Great Modern Ghost Story
","One of the best modern day ghost stories you'll will ever watch. I saw this one 3 or 4 years ago and recently watched it again - just as good the second time around. Would be a great one in a horror film collection.I will not rehash the storyline, I'll just reiterate how good the movie is. There are a handful of jump scares done in good taste.Atmosphere - lots of it! Good acting - you bet ya! Good story - yes it is. There are a handful of jump scares done in good taste, eerie subtle horror, suspenseful at times - definitely worth watching. It's just as good as the classic Hammer Horror films. 9/10",9,0,1,5 October 2017
Shrek," Laugh Out Loud Comedy
","For an animated comedy film based on fairy-tales this movie is outstanding. I never knew my childhood fairy stories could be so funny. I laughed out loud so hard when I first saw this film I had tears streaming down my cheeks.I'll admit it: I'm still a sucker for good old-fashioned fairy-tales. I love a good comedy as well. So Shrek is my style of humor. It is one of the cutest stories and animated films I've ever seen.Shrek is not just for kids/teens - most film loving adults that I've talked movies with loves the Shrek film series. So, if you have not seen Shrek yet then you are missing out on a very funny flick.9/10",9,0,1,22 October 2014
Tombstone," Tombstone is Outstanding
","The first thing I should mention is that I am not a big fan of most western films but Tombstone is outstanding! It's not just the all star cast that makes this movie - it is the story itself that is captivating. Anyone who is the slightest bit interested in American history should watch this movie.The movie has more to offer than just fancy gun-slinging: within the film, you will find action, drama and romance as the story unfolds. The movie is a surprisingly joyful way of learning a bit more history of the old west. My hat's off to the filmmakers.9.5/10",9,0,1,23 June 2014
Ben-Hur," Good But A Little Too Long To Watch Often
","It's a good movie. I like quite a bit but I will admit there are quite a few scenes that could be cut down or cut out completely. If an edited version of this film were made, more people would watch the film more often. The film is way to long for being nothing more than a fictitious story about a fictitious character set in a historical time period with some historical characters. Cut it down to 1 1/2 to 2 hours and the film would be better and easier to watch more often.Lew Wallace wrote his novel in 1880 entitled Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. This film is based on that book. It is not historical as in this is a true story. History films just have some historical places, events and people in a fictional tale.The movie is beautiful - grand, epic without a doubt. And it deserves the awards it has won as well as it's classic status. It just has a bit to many unnecessary scenes or they are just drawn out a bit too long.8/10",8,1,2,19 January 2017
Space Jam," It's An OK Film
","Space Jam is actually a fairly good older comedy film. It's got the Loony Tunes characters in it and that is the best part of the movie - just watching the Loony Tunes in a new way. I have no problem with Michael Jordon either - I realize he is outstanding athlete and was extremely popular at the time this film.The downside, for me, is that I'm not a fan of Basketball. I know it's a very popular sport that many people enjoy it and I will never knock it - it's just not something I am into.Space Jam is worth watching if you like comedies, Loony Tunes and Basketball. If you like Space Jam then you might like similar types of movies: 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' and 'Song of the South'.6/10",6,1,2,23 October 2014
Signs," Good Sci-Fi Thriller
","Signs is a very good sci-fi thriller! The first time I watched it I was in complete suspense through out the entire movie. The second time I viewed the movie I picked up things I missed the first time watching - which made the film even better than watching it the first time around. Strangely, I was more thrilled and scared on the second viewing! Signs has a great cast who played their roles very believably - which is one of the things I enjoyed about this film. The actors did a great job at catching my attention and pulled me deeper into the movie with them.The story is good and plausible, in my opinion, if aliens really did exist and came to earth.I think this a great prime time movie.9/10",9,1,4,26 June 2014
The Sixth Sense," Pretty Good Horror Thriller
","I'm finally getting around to the 4 R's: re-watching, refreshing my mind, rating and reviewing the film. It's a film that is hard to forget but to re-watch it again is always good to refreshen the memory.I don't think I need to rehash what the film is about because others have done that and most people have already seen it. But do want to it's a good film to watch if you haven't seen it. It's a supernatural horror-thriller, a mystery and a drama that is unforgettable.I recently acquired this film for my collection. It's great to see again. One of those movies you don't mind watching from time to time.8/10",8,0,2,19 January 2017
Cinderella," What Fairytale Dreams Are Made Of
",This movie is what fairytale dreams are made of... a beautiful damsel in distress waiting for prince charming to whisk her away to his palace! OK I admit it - I'm still a sucker for the film. This was a childhood favorite of mine and I still enjoy it today! I guess most young girls dreams of her price charming - and I was not one of the exceptions! I guess I'm still waiting my prince to this very day. LOL.This is the kind of film that couples should watch together in order to remember that he should treat her as his princess and she should treat him as her prince... to rekindle their romance (if possible).I still love this movie...10/10,10,1,2,26 June 2014
Rear Window," A Wonderful Mystery-Thriller
","Rear Window is one of those films where it is fun to guess what you believe is going on. Did Jeff (Stewart) really see a murder or is his imagination running wild? With each scene you will see what Jeff (Stewart) sees - is it what Jeff suspects or is there another logical explanation for what Jeff and the audience sees - this is where it's fun to guess; to guess simple, logical explanation outside of covering up a murder.Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's best films. I personally found more mystery and suspense in Rear Window than I did watching Vertigo. Yes if you love a good mystery then I highly recommend Rear Window (as well as Vertigo).9.5/10",9,1,3,19 October 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Looses Nothing
","The 3rd and final film of the LotR series. This one looses nothing it only continues the story. Picks up right where 'Two Towers' leaves off. Grittier story, more foe & dirtier grittier battles - the worst is yet to come... The Witch King of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgul.This film has an air of horror to it... more frightening than the first two films. In the end, you whistle is wet for more.A wicked film well worth watching. High fantasy fans as well as those who love a lot of action and adventure will enjoy watching this one for the first time or again and again.10/10",10,1,2,4 March 2016
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Sweet Dreams
","The creepiest thing about Freddy Krueger that he is a 'Nightmare'; he is not alive - he's dead. He cannot harm you while you are awake - but everyone has to fall asleep sometime.People often have nightmares and sometimes hurt themselves if they flail around to much. Now imagination a nightmare itself causing harm to you - even death. That nightmare is Fred Krueger! A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is a pretty scary film, a little bit on the campy side at times, but overall a good entertaining movie. The best time to watch A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is late night just before you fall asleep. Sweet Dreams! 9/10",9,0,0,3 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Excellent Classic Science Fiction Film
","An excellent classic science fiction film. The movie has the illusion of a high dollar film for a low budget price tag.I saw this film when it first came out in 1977, I was a mere 5 years old, but it made an impression in my memory that I still cannot shake to the very day. No one back then knew that the movie would become iconic - but it did.What George Lucas created is extraordinary - even considering the fact the budget was limited (and you would never know it by watching the film). The special effects and costuming are phenomenal for the time era plus factoring in the limited funding to create the film (even by today's standards). The sets and ships appear elaborate yet there was not much to them.The story is captivating and well executed by the actors playing the roles. I will not rehash the story for those that have seen it nor will I ruin the film for those who have not.It is a must see movie.10/10",10,1,8,23 June 2014
300," So Damned Good!
","I generally love these types of films! And 300 was no exception - what an amazing film! The story so damned good... I was drawn back in time, a time of men facing dangerous hand-to-hand battles. Their armor and shields must be strong enough to face a fierce pounding and their weapons mighty enough to slay their foes. But the most important thing in battle is to work together as one... to create the best formations and tactics! To defend your brother-in-arms! The costuming took my breath way as did the settings and scenery. The casting was perfect as each of them played their parts as if they actually were their character - very believable.9/10",9,1,4,25 June 2014
Apollo 13," Houston, I Love This Film
","Houston, I Love This Film. It is a good account of what happened on the Apollo 13 mission to the moon. I cannot say it is 100% accurate but I do believe it's close enough to give viewers a good idea of what happened on that trip to the moon.Outstanding performances that were very believable from the cast! The film pulled me right into the spacecraft with the astronauts. It's a visually stimulating movie to watch.The movie still makes a good prime time flick to enjoy. It could be enjoyed as a double feature with 'Moon (2009)' or the classic '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)'.9/10",9,1,1,1 July 2014
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," A Good Vampire Story
","I have never read Anne Rice's novel but she did write the screenplay for this film - all I can say is 'Wow! One of the best Vampire films I have ever seen and one of best stories involving Vampires.' Everything about this film is amazing: the costuming, the sets, the story, cinematography, and the casting! Lestat (Cruise) is one of the vilest Vampires I have ever seen but towards the end of the film I found I understood him and somewhat sympathized with the character.Claudia (Dunst) I felt really bad for her... she is a young girl turned and she will never have a chance to grow up.Louis (Pitt) I felt pity for. He never wanted to 'feast on a human'. He remained strong in that area for a long time - feasting of small animals most of the time. But towards the end he became more like Lestat.This is a must see for all Vampire fans! 9.5/10",9,5,5,21 October 2014
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Still Funny
",Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) has got to be Python's masterpiece! It is still one of the top rated comedies to date because it is very much a funny dorky comedy.The story of 'Holy Grail' is not sensitive material to most viewers. By sensitive material I will reference other Monty Python comedy movies like 'Life of Brian' or 'The Meaning of Life'. So I believe one would enjoy 'Holy Grail' if they have never seen it and like comedy films.'Holy Grail' would make fun double feature with Mel Brooks' 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' for a hilarious night of pure movie enjoyment.9/10,9,0,2,4 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," George Lucas' Best
","In 1980 I was 8 years old... I still have vague memories of standing outside the movie theater waiting to get in to the (then) new film. I was so excited I could hardly stand still. Once inside the theater I saw what was to become my favorite movie in the Star Wars Saga! The plot thickens in this sci-fi saga as we learn more about the young Luke Skywalker and the vile Darth Vader as well a budding romance between Leia Organa and Han Solo. The movie also revels a little more about Han Solo's past with the introduction of new characters Lando Calrissian, Lobot and the Bounty Hunters (in particular Boba Fett). We are also introduced to the wise Jedi master Yoda.I will not say more due to the fact I do not want to spoil the film for any first time viewers. All I can say it find a copy, watch and enjoy one of the most exciting and historical science fiction films ever made.10/10",10,0,1,23 June 2014
Braveheart," Not Perfect, But Still Good Cinema
","This might not be a perfect film on the life of William Wallace but it is a really good story and gives us an idea of what might have happened and a few things that really did happen. OK there are inaccuracies and this is a historic and biographical movie - but those inaccuracies kinda made the film a bit better.I like the film. It's entertaining: sometimes fun and funny other times gut-wrenching and very sad. There are some exciting battle scenes, great costuming (no matter how inaccurate the kilts are), super nice scenery and some fine acting.No, Braveheart is not perfect historically but it is good entertainment.7.5/10",7,1,2,17 January 2017
Moon," The Best Sci-Fi in Years!
","Outstanding! Brilliant! A jaw-dropping movie. Perfect from start to finish. A must not miss movie. The story is just too good to miss out on. I almost cried at the end of the movie... I was blown away.**************Spoilers**************** I was totally blown away with the unique concept and combination of cloning and space. I must say this is a very plausible scenario, something like this could happen in the future - and that is scary! The movie raises ethical questions concerning clones: 'Are they less than human than a natural born human?' 'Are they human at all?' 'Should clones be used in labor to replace humans in dangerous jobs?' 'Are they anywhere near the same person that they were cloned from?' -- many more questions come to mind.On a personal note: I side with the clones. My heart was bleeding for them. I felt it was totally unfair to them... they are humans.*************************************** I think a bonus to the movie is it has an over all retro look and feel to the film. I really liked that.10/10",10,2,6,1 July 2014
The Breakfast Club," A Great Teen Film!
","I cannot believe this movie is not rated higher on IMDb! This movie is so funny. The movie is accurate in the way teens are and the groups they belong to in school. The movie's story is excellent and the acting is perfect! You have all the main types in this film: 1. The Outcast, Dark (Ally Sheedy) 2. The Princess, Light (Molly Ringwald) 3. The Criminal, Dark (Judd Nelson) 4. The Jock, Light (Emilio Estevez) 5. The Nerd, Neutral (Anthony Michael Hall)I was 13 when this film came out - just started high school - and yes the movie reminded me of a few kids I went to school with. I loved the film then and still love it today!Some the hottest songs of the time period are in this film. Great soundtrack!One question to ask yourself: Which of the 5 categories of stereo-types did you fall into? I was a mix of the Outcast and Nerd - the two characters I identified with the most. LOL!9.5/10",9,1,1,25 June 2014
Gladiator," A True Epic! A Phenomenal Film!
",If you have never seen the movie Gladiator (2000) then you are missing out on one of the best epic films ever made. The movie lives up to all it's hype and I think it will be a film that people will love to watch for years to come. It's one of my all time favorite movies.The cinematographers did an outstanding job as did the movie editors. The costuming and sets are impeccable. The cast could not have done finer at acting out each of their roles that they played so believably and beautifully well. The timing of the actors could not have been executed any better.The story is so extraordinarily good that it will leave you as breathless as all the action going on. The fight scenes will have you on the edge-of-your-seat as the men battle to the death for victory.The film's ending came as a surprise to me - so much better than I was ever imagining. It was the perfect ending to a perfect movie. Not a historically accurate film - but a great movie that will leave you thinking in the very end.10/10,10,2,4,29 June 2014
Contact," A Realistic Sci-Fi Film
","'Contact' is an outstanding film that deals with space aliens. It's a story that is plausible, very realistic approach to questions 'What if space aliens exist?' and 'What if we make contact?'.'Contact' is right up there with the movie 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' because they are embodied with realism. Both are similar in the realistic way they approach the idea of 'what if' we find out that space aliens exist. Yet, both films are completely different stories and angles of the 'what if' line of thought.This Jodie Foster film, 'Contact', is one of the best movies I have ever seen dealing with aliens and is a must see for the people that enjoy extra terrestrials.8.5/10",8,1,3,29 June 2014
Donnie Darko," Brilliant!
","I had avoided watching this film for quite few years - why? I had a couple of people that liked b-rated films the way I do to tell me this is a good film - watch it! I thought 'Oh no not another crappy b-rated horror film - I only like certain ones! And the name 'Darko' sounds like a worse than cheap b-rated film.' Then more people told me to watch this film because I would love it. What is going on here I thought - why are so many people telling me that I would love this film? Well I finally broke down to watch the movie - I had no idea who played in it, nor did I know anything about the movie only that I would love it - so I had gone into watching the film thinking I would hate it. Well I ate my words and it didn't taste very well... the movie is Brilliant! And I do in-fact love this film! I thank everyone that told me to watch this movie! Yes Donnie Darko is a very dark, thrilling mystery film that will leave you days later pondering the film. It is well worth watching! ***********Spoiler***********Time Travel - if you could go back in time, what would you change? Donnie Darko decided to go back in time to die - to save others from their deaths and any pain that Donnie himself may have caused others. The movie shows how one person can influence the lives of others. For example: If Gretchen Ross had not have met and gone out with Donnie then she would not have died that night.*****************************This is a film you may have to watch more than once to full get a grip on everything that is going on. I highly recommend this movie but be prepared to think during and after the movie - it is one of those types of films.10/10",10,0,4,25 June 2014
Back to the Future," A Wonderful Sci-Fi Adventure
","An outstanding sci-fi adventure - one of the coolest movies ever produced. Yes it's great to watch if you enjoy good comedy, science fiction and are interested in the concept of time travel.I was 13 years old in 1985 and, like most kids who watched this film, I wanted a really super cool time traveling delorean just like Doc and Marty. The idea of time travel will get you thinking and wishing you could go back in time. It seems like a lot of fun but the paradoxes that time travel could create might be a bit bizarre just as Doc (Lloyd) and Marty (Fox) found out.This sci-fi is a wonderful classic and is still great by today's film standards.10/10",10,4,5,27 October 2014
The Birds," A Very Good Horror Thriller
","A very good suspenseful thriller from the master of mystery, murder, mayhem and horror Alfred Hitchcock. The plot of the movie is just as you would guess: birds attaching people and the people will do anything to stop the terror. Yet as simple as the plot sounds, the movie is so much better than it sounds like it would be - it's the characters themselves that take the film to a A+ movie level rather than a simple b-rated horror movie.Yes I have experienced birds attacking me in the past. And fairly recently, some birds were attacking my cats because they were trying to protect their babies in a nest - so that in itself give me a basic idea of how truly terrifying it would be if all birds started attacking people as depicted in the film 'The Birds'.This is a must see for those that love horror and thrillers! 8.5/10",8,2,4,25 June 2014
The Wizard of Oz," Fantasy Classic
","The Wizard of Oz is a long time favorite of mine. One I used to watch every Easter with my family. It is a delightful classic film.This film I believe most all movie watchers have seen and have drawn their own conclusions as to whether or not they like the film.I know of hard-core blood and gore fans that enjoys The Wizard of Oz due to it's darker tones (witches, wizards and evil flying monkeys). And there are others that I know of that prefer a more 'wholesome' style to their films which include this movie. Really this film brings together people who are basically different from each other - from hard-cores all the way to wholesome - not many movies have this capability.10/10",10,4,5,23 June 2014
The Martian," Excellent Sci-Fi Adventure
","Fine example of how Science Fiction should be! Suspenseful, dramatic, splashes of humor with a lot of realism make this movie worth watching. Mark Watney is presumed dead after an accident and left behind on the planet Mars alone. Mark awakens and has the strong will to survive - he finds a way to contact NASA but NASA runs into problems in getting Mark back home. Time is running out - can they bring Mark back to Earth before it's too late? 9/10",9,0,0,5 September 2018
