Blade Runner 2049," Wanted to love this movie so bad. But it was slow.
","There is nothing wrong with the story but I found the movie to be too slow. Altough the concept, story and some of the dialogues were really good but the pace of the story was the problem for me.",5,1,1,11 May 2020

Unbreakable," Solid Intriguing film.
","Might be slow for some but overall this is a solid intriguing film with some great performances. Also the first one from Unbreakable triology. Though I agree with many opinions on the ending of the film. It could have been much better, but then also this movie is brilliant.Another Shyamalan's gem",7,0,0,29 April 2020
The Irishman," Treat to watch legends together
","I have always liked Scorcese movie, but this one was not that good. It's not a bad movie actually, I liked it but the run time is long. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro came together after such a long time and it was treat to see them both on screen. Joe pesci was awesome and Scorsese directing all the tree legends was nothing sort of brilliant. Watch this movie for all three legends.",6,0,1,20 May 2020
Yes Man," Funny, amusing and yes...motivational too!
",I liked the concept of being a Yes Man. This is a surprisingy good movie with Jim Carrey carrying the film on his shoulder. The film is funny yet offers some motivation on life.,7,0,1,15 March 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Well the last one hour worked for me
","I had high hopes from the film and I can say my hopes didn't crashed. Quentin Tarantino gave his usual classic filmmaking in the last one hour. Frankly speaking for the first hour, I wasn't that impressed. While both the actor did great jobs in their roles. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad pitt give their all in this film but Al Pacino was simply wasted.The superb climax made this movie a good overall.",7,0,2,17 May 2020
Dumb and Dumber," Laugh, laugh and laugh.
","Dumb and Dubmber is a fun movie. No matter how depressed you are, this movie will make you laugh. Jim Carey, you are good!",7,0,0,15 March 2020
Green Book," Delightful tale of friendship, compassion and dignity
","Green book is a delightful watch. It's modest, honest and both the lead actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali aced their roles. It's a beautiful story of friendship, compassion and dignity. Peter Farrelly has crafted this movie very brilliantly.And cinematography was excellent. Loved this cinema.",7,1,1,26 April 2020
