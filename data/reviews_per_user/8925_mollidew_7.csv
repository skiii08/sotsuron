The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Funny, paranormal romance
","I wonder if anyone realizes these books that spawned the movies are labeled for 'children,' and not adults. The books have received many awards under the child category. If adults cannot get into them that may be the reason. I think the films are great and I am neither a child nor one of the young adults constantly complaining about something with these films. I am a senior and I thoroughly enjoyed all the films. As for the books, well Meyer is a good story teller and a beginning writer. Books cannot fully translate to the screen and after all they are made to make money. My daughter works in management in a movie theater and the film is popular, so much so in a theater that doesn't generally have a lot of attendance it has been packed for days to view this film and more people keep streaming in. I believe they toned down the film for the sake of younger people who have read the books and would like to see the movies. Even Meyer was made to tone down the books by editors. It has always been geared generally for a younger audience but when put into film it really should have been reconciled and gone for the adult audience is my only criticism.I laughed through the wedding in various parts not because it was silly but it was cute the way they did the speakers part. I knew what was coming and I think they did a good job. This is a romance movie that has vampires and shape shifters in it. This type of genre is generally labeled paranormal romance. The last part should be more to the taste of die hard vampire movie fans but let me tell you, all vampire stories are fiction and made up. So people should get over ridiculing these stories. What they show is very clever and entertaining.You have to take the films on their own merit and not judge them by the books at all. I found Stewart and Pattinson to be good at carrying over the way they portrayed their characters. I think this movie shows the vampire in a more humanistic manner which throws off many people but that is what I like about them...to me it makes sense. I also liked the fact they brought in other vampires as an extension of their family and how they mixed everyone together getting along for the sake of the two who just got married. I didn't feel the movie dragged on at all and liked the detour to the island off of Brazil to be very tender in nature with each main character dealing with their insecurities and Bella being a virgin with no prior idea of what to expect and especially with a vampire that didn't want to hurt her. The dynamic is unusual and makes for the entertainment value of the movie. Over all I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and await the second half. Try to keep in mind the story is an extension of a vampire clan that has made their choice not to kill humans but it is a side issue to the romance between Bella and Edward so therefore if you don't like romance movies with a paranormal twist, you won't like this movie. I think it was excellent.",10,3,11,22 November 2011
Star Trek," Science fiction, Nostalgia, Action, Adventure, comedy
","I give this movie a 10 because I enjoyed it as much as my favorite Star Trek movie in the past which was Star Trek IV. I am a die-hard Trekker and I lived through the original series and loved watching the characters portrayed in their youth. I liked them all except Zachary Quinto. I feel he was a bad choice to play Spock. I think it was a popularity choice. I am not one of his fans and I feel they should have chosen someone taller and more gaunt looking. There was something about the way he portrayed Spock that didn't give the feel of the character. I have personally never cared for this actor and really feel he did NOT fit the part. I was surprised at how they portrayed Ohura but I liked the actress they chose. In my opinion, the choice of the actor to play Kirk was outstanding in every way. He and Eric Bana in my opinion made the movie, not to mention all the outstanding visual effects. There was no way anyone could get bored watching this offering of Star Trek. It hailed the old but it respectfully portrayed the new. I hope they will make more movies of the early years. One last mention is Bruce Greenwood which I think is a great unsung actor. He always adds class to any movie he is in, in my opinion whether a good or bad character. The part of Christopher Pike was perfect for him. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe Quinto will grow on me if they make anymore movies with the younger characters, but it won't keep me from going to see the films if they choose to make any more.",10,1,7,5 September 2009
Underworld Awakening," Vampires and Hybrids collide
","I can see some did not like this addition to the Underworld series of movies and some made derogatory remarks about the Twilight series which has NOTHING to do with this one at all and is a good string of movies. I weigh movies on their own merit and not by what I think a vampire should be like...they are entirely fictional in nature. They can be anything the author dreams up. This one, for me, brought a breath of fresh air by introducing some new characters. I didn't see the gore as being anymore or less than any of the other movies but if you follow the plot, it is inconceivable that there would be none when the humans are trying to eradicate vampires and lycans alike. I thought it interesting they introduced a child with the traits of both given birth by Selene while she was kept asleep and fathered by Michael. I don't know why people wouldn't like this movie. I preferred this one to the third movie and they left it open for another installment. It did pretty well at the box office. Kate Beckinsale does a great job as Selene yet a fourth time. I liked it very much and I hope they make another one bringing Michael back into the story once they find him. I saw no problem with the acting and thought it was a good idea they continued in another direction because the other one had run its course.",8,3,7,14 May 2012
I Am Legend," I Am Legend
","The most recent version of I Am Legend had a lot of problems with budget. It was suggested for remake a number of times but shelved due to soaring costs. This is what they came up with that worked and fit into budget. I hope people understand this. Will Smith did an excellent job in the part of Neville. He really showed the isolation of the character and how he held it in because he had the dog. I have the original book and it is somewhat different but this is an adaptation. All of them have been but the first movie, 'Last Man On Earth' showed the beings to be what Matheson wrote, 'vampires.' They were not zombies but his vision of a type of vampire-like state that developed. In the first movie Neville (Vincent Price) went out by day staking them. As they made more adaptations screenwriters brought out the more zombie like nature of his vampires. They were not patterned after the Eastern European vampires most identify with. Matheson wrote some of the screenplay for the first movie with Vincent Price but he didn't like how it turned out. One has to keep within a budget and so what one can do in a book cannot always be translated onto the big screen the same way.This version was very good and they were the Dark Seekers and Hemocytes. They were vampires too that many are calling zombies. If you see the cover of the book first released again to publication prior to the Will Smith's cover they have fangs more or less. I don't know what the producers are saying but the book is about people transforming into vampires and that is why they didn't come out into the sun except for the adaptation,Night of the Comet which was very loosely based on the story and only inspired by it.All in all I really liked it and felt it could have had a better ending for the viewing audience than the predictable killing him off, martyr. It would have been nice for once if the man got away and was awestruck by the surprise that there really was a colony in the end. Sort of the beat up man living in isolation finally finding others and a new life. His character was never suppose to be a doctor anyway. Each group that takes this on makes their own changes very similarly to the things Spielberg does when he ruined War of the Worlds.I have to say though standing on its own merits I thought the movie was a 10.",10,0,2,20 October 2008
Clash of the Titans," Action, Adventure and mythology
","I saw the 1981 version of Clash of the Titans and really liked it. It followed the mythology closer. It was much more campy than the 2010 rendition. The actors are not to blame for the script. All of the movies are adaptations whether it be from a novel or folklore. Greek mythology is a mixture of all types of creatures and gods sneaking into human's chambers to mate with them. Therefore, there are numerous children such as Perseus who may or may not know their birthright. I don't know why they decided to change the mythology and have Danae die or add Io who has nothing to do with Perseus as well as add in Hades instead of Poseidon to release the Kraken. One has to take it on its own merits and not compare the two stories. This version was done more seriously. I have seen many movies made on mythological topics and this moved and had the flavor of most all of them. It is always a character/s trying to thwart the activity of the gods and come out victoriously. Usually during this attempt there is a quest and fighting. Most stories are somewhat violent. I didn't see anything wrong with this movie on any level. It was entertaining and since I do not have a drama degree I won't judge the acting which seemed fine to me. I really like Sam Worthington and liked him in this movie as well. I did miss Bibo ( Robotic owl sent by Athena to help Perseus) but at least there was a cameo. He wouldn't have fit well into this remake so they were wise to leave him out. Besides after awhile, it got aggravating that you couldn't understand what it was saying in my opinion which was the only downside to the character.One thing that was added that I thought made the movie more real was the fact he wanted to fight like a man and not be given help with things sent for him to use by Zeus. He was a little stubborn about it but it only set the mood about how he felt concerning the gods. The people had gotten very tired of them meddling in their lives. It had the same feel as the first one but I guess the writers wanted to make it slightly different to make their own mark on telling this tale. I don't see why everyone is putting down this movie. It was a typical mythological piece with an ultimate happy ending. I really liked it and the fact they tried to do something fresh instead of create a redo exactly like the first version but with fancier special effects.",10,7,14,10 April 2010
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds
","I have to say I was so disappointed with this movie. Spielberg took a lot of dramatic license with this movie not to mention they cast Tom Cruise in the main role. I do not find his acting to my taste and it will depend on each individual if they like his characterization. I felt the part of a deadbeat dad as an under theme a little cliché and predictable. Perhaps Spielberg was trying to create a theme within the story similar to the movie 'Signs' where the crux of the film deals with a family and their interactions and problem solving skills under a situation that is totally unbelievable and horrific. What it demonstrated to me was that the children were spoiled, Cruise learned what it was like to take on responsibility and the Mother was totally inept not noticing that her children were brats. Granted they had a lot of animosity toward their Dad but they were disrespectful and rude throughout the whole movie and totally self-absorbed.I am a big H. G. Wells fan but this movie reminded me of another that had machines that came up out of the ground. This isn't what happened they came from outer space in vehicles and in no other adaptation did anything come up out of the ground. Even the TV series didn't do that and the space ships were kept similar to the 50s movie, which was much better except for special effects. Why doesn't anyone place the movie in England??? Why do you have to modernize it? Do it like the book. Even the first one changed location. I didn't like the part Dakota Fanning played at all and didn't think she fit the role. I kept wanting to tell that spoiled kid to just shut up and the boy was totally in la la land. The children made a lot of the movie annoying. No father is as stupid as they portrayed Cruise,in my opinion.The best part is in the basement scenes with Tim Robbins; he was excellent. I didn't like the idea that they put in the movie where there are children that the father went in and killed Tim Robbins character. They should have left or tied and gagged him. The ending in regard to the aliens was similar to the 50s movie. I don't remember the book but I think that was the same. I felt this adaptation was awful. I have watched it a few times and it grows on you but still in all I would think most Wells fans would hate this movie. Get off the Cruise kick and give newer, younger people a chance who can act better.",1,0,1,20 October 2008
August Rush," Great Fantasy Movie
","This movie was excellent; the acting, choice of actors and music. It is an adventure in music. Yes it is unbelievable as a real world story and almost metaphorical with shades of Oliver Twist. This is something you watch and ride on the emotions it brings out. It is not suppose to be taken as truth. Many movies of this type have been made over the years. The only difference with August Rush is that it is set in modern times. The movie whets your imagination and carries you into a realm of if you believe hard enough everything you wish will come true. In the case of this story, he communicated through music.It is somewhat old-fashioned good watching which wouldn't appeal to modern day watchers who prefer blood, guts and horror. It mixed real world happenings where children were used to make money but not in the usual way shown in movies but through their musical talents. It was a musical fantasy that had a happy ending...what more can anyone say. One cannot pick something apart that isn't suppose to be believed to have happened. August Rush is a modern day fairytale.",10,3,5,5 February 2009
