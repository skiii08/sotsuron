The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Great movie
",If you liked the book this film is great. Very good book to film conversion. Very good visually and enjoyed the performances from all Actors. Excellent direction and retains characterisation and atmosphere from books. Action was very good and Jacob is FINE :). The humour that runs through the books is brought out beautifully in this film especially regarding Bella's Dad. Bella's relationship with her Dad is also portrayed well. All the fantastical events are really brought to life. I think this film has been my favourite so far. It really brings out the action parts in the book especially the final scene. A perfect film for a Friday night in - recommend to all Twilight fans. I saw this on the big screen and have recently bought on Blu Ray. Can't wait for Part 2.,8,0,6,10 November 2012
