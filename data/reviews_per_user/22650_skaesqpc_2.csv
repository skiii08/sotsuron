The Ring," Ridiculous, dull and uneventful plot...
","The only reason that this movie is somewhat scary at the start is due to your ignorance of the nature and history of the ring.  Once you get clued in, after a dull and contrived search for the truth about the ring, the movie becomes more laughable than scary.  To exacerbate matters, after the movie has ostensibly ended, there is a cheap twist thrown in which is a transparent attempt to launch a sequel.SPOILER AHEAD...If you can believe that a dead girl can make a symbol ridden video tape from beyond the grave, then distribute it, then make phone calls to the viewer right after he has seen it, and then come right out of the tv screen to scare the life out of her victim, then you might get scared.  If not, you might either laugh or yawn your way to the end...",5,1,2,4 January 2004
Lost in Translation," Simulates a long dull trans Atlantic flight
","Beware. This is not a great film, or even a good film. If fact, it is not even a film at all. Instead, the experience of sitting in a movie theater watching this pretentious claptrap for 2 hours gives one the illusion that they are on a long dull flight to Japan. You just want it to end! But it won't. And you have to keep waiting and waiting, all the while you have nothing to do to pass your time. Exactly how many times can you look at your watch during this movie? There is no plot to help pass the time. You keep waiting for something to happen, but it doesn't. You keep waiting for something poignant or something funny. But nothing happens. Just postcard like snippets of Japan, which is akin to flipping through a tourist magazine while on your long range flight. There is a ridiculously long scene of bad Karaoke in some Japense dive bar. Funny? No. Pointless? Yes. But so is the rest of the movie. Do you get the point? Actually, one good way to get across how boring this movie is, and to simulate what it feels like to watch it, is to keep writing the same thing over and over again for the next 1,000 lines. But then you'd stop reading. Just like you are going to want to stop watching this film. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack. But the movie is so God awful, you don't want anyone associated with this movie to make any money whatsoever, so to spite yourself, and the folks associated with this movie, do NOT buy the soundtrack. You can download it from various sources for free.",3,5,10,4 January 2004
