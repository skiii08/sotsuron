Vertigo," Let there be color!
","Since there are already so many real good comments on this film I want to focus on only one aspect.Vertigo is a great example for what color films really can look like! Not only do I want to praise the quality of the Technicolor dye transfer prints but also more the way Hitchcock used color to create moods. Many directors used light to create moods in black and white movies but only very few ever got so far as to use the much greater palette of colors for the same purpose. One wonders why. Some directors decide for an overall color look, which is often done in the lab, but not on the set.Vertigo is full of scenes where the colors have been saturated or changed to create a special feeling. Hitchcock even went so far as to openly dye some frames is bright unnatural colors. He played around with colors in all his color films but never as much as in this one. Think for example on James Stewart's nightmare in the middle of the film. There are frames dyed purple and green; the cemetery scenes are red, inserted to the rhythm of the music with normal frames. Kim Novak is often bathed in colored light like in the famous hotel room scene, where she appears like a ghost with all the green light around her.The shading is also important. In the scene in the bookshop we hear a dark and sad story while at the same time the light dimes down to simulate dusk. In the scene where Judy remembers the real events in the bell tower it starts with an outdoor scene, which we have already seen but it is now much darker than the first time. In the sequence where Stewart follows Novak to the cemetery everything feels unnatural since every scene glows through the use of a filter that creates a blur. The non-color of Kim Novak's dress as Madeleine is also a very important aspect in the film. She has to color her hair to become Madeleine again at the end of the picture.The way color is used in this film gives it this dreamlike quality that allows endless interpretations. A true masterpiece!",10,68,83,26 January 2005
To Rome With Love," A bad joke
","Sorry for throwing another stone, as others have done before me, but they are right!It's hard to believe that Woddy Allen did not realize what a boring film this has become. Just putting a lot of famous faces before a camera is not enough. Alac Baldwin for example has almost nothing to do but look and giving some advises to Jesse Eisenberg that are so unconvincing one thinks he just wandered onto the set and Allen out of the blue gave him some lines to say. We have seen other weak products by Mr. Allen but usually the had some merits to cling to. Here I only looked at my watch hoping time would go by faster. The film feels like someone stole the first draft and executed it without any changes. The jokes are old, lifted from other (better) movies or simply predictable. What a waste of actors! I hope they had at least a good time in Rome, something you don't have when watching this film.",5,1,4,30 December 2013
All Quiet on the Western Front," Simply the best anti-war film ever!
","This film truly deserves the title anti-war movie! There are many films who have been advertised like that but they are just films about war or have a wartime background. Or try to be anti-war but aren't. 'All Quiet on the Western Front' never gives one the feeling that the front is somewhere you want to be or that it is a place of great heroics. I have seen most of the famous war or anti-war movies, but with the exception of 'Paths of Glory' not one of them ever comes close to this. We see here how young men get coaxed into volunteering to become soldiers by their teacher in school and we live with them in the trenches and one by one we die with them. Their is no heroism, but their is a lot of humanism in this film and that is the greatness of it. It is perfectly played and photographed too! There was no question for me but to give it a 10.",10,3,5,27 December 2004
