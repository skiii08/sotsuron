Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The saga continues, as strong as ever!
","As I watched 'The Phantom Menace' I felt that it had all the elements of the earlier trilogy.  When the action got intense, the film was perfect on cliff-hanging you and cutting to the next action sequence, like the way it did in 'Return Of The Jedi.'  The movie is definitely full of eye-candy special effects, and even hints at events to come in the next episode.  I was very satisfied, there was not a dull moment!  I look forward to the next episode!",9,0,0,20 May 1999
