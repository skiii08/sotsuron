The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie I've ever seen!!
","I saw this movie at the cinema and I can honestly say it was the WORST movie I have ever seen! I almost walked out in the middle of it. The camera work was so unprofessional and it made me nauseous. The whole movie was so cheap, uninteresting and dumb. I was so bored! I have watched many movies but this still tops all of them as the worst! Not one single person had anything good to say about it as everyone left the cinema. There was way too much hype about it. I was extremely disappointed!!!!",1,2,4,27 July 2003
