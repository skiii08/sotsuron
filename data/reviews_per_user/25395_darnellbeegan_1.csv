Lucky Number Slevin," Good but not Great
","I doubt if the even the filmmakers of Lucky Number Slevin know how to summarise it...The film is self-conscious of this though, and from the beginning we are implicitly informed that a clear and taught plot is not where we are to search for this film's purpose, its substance, it raison d'etre. Stylistically, Lucky Number Slevin is a joy...still, it would constitute no loss to the potential viewer if he were to forgo a trip to the large screen for this...wait for DVD. I have not touched on the most evident strength of this film. Before even seeing the film, I could guess from the credited cast list that the acting would be up to par.",6,1,7,14 April 2006
