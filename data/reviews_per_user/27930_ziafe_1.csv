The Sound of Music," I fell in love...
","I saw this film when I was already a young adult. I had to play 'DO RE MI' for a music exam... I saw it and I fell in love! The Italian version is not so good, because both voices and lyrics are of a very low level, but I soon got the English version, and it was love at first sight! It is a film about love, and I believe in love! Music is wonderful, Julie Andrews and Chris Plummer give us a beautiful interpretation, Salzburg is a wonderful city...what else could I say? I don't like musicals, but this one is something different:music doesn't seem to enter by force or 'by mistake' in this story! Everyone should see it, because it makes you dream, and makes you understand what love is. Don't listen people who say 'Oh, it's saccharine'...it's romantic, which is quite a different thing.",10,3,10,28 June 2004
