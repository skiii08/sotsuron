Requiem for a Dream," A movie you should probably watch once.
","There are a few films out there that are able to combine beauty and our broken world. In a fantastically perfect image, they show things for what they are and how the people in these situations are truly broken or become broken.This is perhaps the greatest example of such a film.Stylistically, 'Requiem for a Dream' is great to watch. You see it and it's beautiful. While at the same time, you are seeing some of the worst case scenarios of drug addiction. And at the end you are left with that sensation of WTF did I just watch.You should probably watch this once, it's definitely an experience.",7,0,0,11 December 2019
