Vertigo," My Personal Favorite - Dazzling and Incomparable
","After watching movies for almost forty years (is that possible!), I wondered what might qualify as my personal favorite.  Sunset Blvd? Becket? Raiders of the Lost Ark? All About Eve? A Star is Born (37 version)? Dodsworth? Body Heat? Quite an eclectic mix, huh!Vertigo heads my personal list. And I remember when first (finally) seeing this, after several years of it being unavailable. WOW! But that was only the initial viewing, with the plot captivating me.  The movie had received only lukewarm reviews and was not considered top tier Hitchcock (perhaps this was in the early 1970's).Delighted that so many IMDB members, and critics too, have altered their opinions over the past 30 years.  Nice to be part of a majority for once LOLWhat dazzles me about Vertigo is virtually everything! This score was not even nominated for an Oscar (we play the soundtrack every few weeks). The photography, use of color, of one of the world's best looking cities. Costumes, everything is classy Hitchcock.I remember timing one of the early sequences, perhaps 5 full minutes go by without any dialog (guess Hitch wanted to briefly return to his early pre-talkie days!). I bet this movie would be quite a splendid experience to watch with the sound off!Ok, the story is fantastic (in all senses of the word).  But how did Hitch get Kim Novak to give this performance?But let's talk about James Stewart, to my mind, the most talented of all movie actors (not that Cary Grant, Edward G. Robinson and Jack Nicolson are not right up there as well).  Without repeating what everyone else has written, among the greats this is his greatest.Color, script, acting, mood, music, photography --- Hitch, thank you for this masterwork.  Hey, maybe we should watch it again tonite!",10,4,9,5 April 2003
Brokeback Mountain," Glorious!
","Thanks to all those involved in the creation of this film! It was a difficult project to get off the ground, yet, after too many years of delays, Brokeback Mountain has emerged with a happy ending ... for its viewers get to see a masterpiece! This love story, with its rich psychological, political, sociological overtones, is still essentially about the power of human connections. Under Ang Lee's care, and the remarkable work of the two screenwriter(I had read the short story), a modern love story, among two unlikely protagonists, amidst the grandeur, and misery of rural America, unfolds. Hopefully, those many who took a chance to bring this film to life will earn many rewards. SPOILER --- Several hours after watching this instant classic, I remain angry, disappointed at disturbed by Ennis' inability to alter his life. Things were hardly fulfilling for him by the mid 1970s: divorced, alone, 'always broke', bored. He had a TV, he was aware that the world was changing, and he certainly yearned for time with Jack. Moving away from a failed life, just getting in a car and moving to California or Texas, Oregon, anywhere just to be with Jack, why the hell not? Being a waiter, a factory worker, anything!, as long as he had the one passion in his life with him, how could you resist? Clearly the demons that haunted him kept him from prevailing.But enough armchair psychology, and let's get a couple million viewers, especially young men, into the movie theater to really be exposed to something different, striking, important and memorable.",10,13,15,25 December 2005
Closer," Most Excellent Surprise
","Being partial to 'talky dramas', I wondered why I had somehow missed this one (on Broadway as well a few years back). Perhaps I balked on the film as I was not, frankly, not a major Julia Roberts fan (although quite intrigued by the talented male leads). Gave this a try tonite and, to my delight, totally engrossed. And surely this the following statement is represents the view of a tiny minority --- Julia Roberts has never been better. Nuanced, real, adult, bravo Ms. Roberts! Mike Nichols directing shall we say a new Millennium spin-off of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf', all these years later, and exquisitely well. One of the rare post-age 60 directors in film history to still have that touch (rival Clint Eastwood another).Jude Law and Clive Owen delivered what I had hoped for, three dimensional portrayals of real people. They are among my favorite performers (the latter would have been a swell James Bond). Natalie Portman really good, filling-out a quartet that merits lots of praise.With all the absurd remakes crowding the screen, the one-note violence and puerile humor, the absurdly bloated 'tentpoles' crowding the screen, how refreshing, how grand to see a film about four well fleshed out characters, flawed, annoying, sympathetic, foolish ... I rate this a 9 of 10.",10,1,1,24 December 2005
The Village," Big Trouble in the Little Village ... And For Viewers Too
","Oh my, don't want to say too many bad things about a venture that involved so many talented people. But IMDb exists for frank postings, and I was so displeased with this movie that, forgive me film-makers, I really wanted to let off some steam.The script was the core problem for me, it was so uninvolving, so slow at the start, and so absurd at the end. A first rate group of actors did bring life to their roles, but The Sixth Sense this is not (but then I thought Signs was not very good, ruined by an awful second half).Ms. Howard was excellent in the only good role, while Adrien Brody sure has talent. But even for a mere 99 cents on Pay Per View I was ready to call this misfire off after sixty very long minutes. Poor Mr. Shyamalan may be getting budgets, and pretty good grosses, but he is seeming more like a one trick pony with every film. 2/10",2,6,13,26 February 2005
Collateral," So Much Talent, So Much Promise and Then Off The Tracks
","A big admirer of Michael Mann (even Heat, and failed TV series Robbery Homicide), and always enjoy the talented Mr Cruise. As a Raymond Chandler lover, a mystery (action) thriller set in LA, I am already biased in favor. Jamie Foxx as a film actor is new to me, but eager to check his work out.So ... what exactly went wrong? Certainly not the initial 90 minutes, which while hardly original and a bit far-fetched, featured a deliciously malevolent Tom Cruise and the usual Michael Mann flourishes. But then ...SPOILERS (not detailed but don't look anyway!): Too many coincidences (and some you can probably figure out a mile away), turn something a bit different into an improbable, let's face it silly denouement. So while most of the film was, to me, Above Average, those last 30 minutes drag this promising enterprise lower.",6,0,0,12 February 2005
K-19: The Widowmaker," Much Better Than Anticipated
","Maybe I saw a different film from the poorly received, notable box office failure released two years ago! Exciting, sad and provocative, this 'inspired by events' movie was far better than I expected. No problems with Harrison Ford for me here (after all, his heritage is Russian on his mom's side), and Liam Neeson and the cast were just fine. This is not usually my favorite type of movie, but, watched on Pay Cable, came across as a solid entry in the genre.Ironically, I may be one of the few who saw 'K19' (dreadful title) after seeing Liam Neeson and Peter Sarsgaard in 'Kinsey' (perhaps the polar opposite of this film). Talk about versatility (oh, wait, Liam was a strong leader in both). Sorry 'K-19' failed to ignite positive reactions.",9,4,7,13 November 2004
Mystic River," Superlative Acting, Very Flawed Plot
","Kudos to the cast, remarkable performances by Penn, Robbins (almost unrecognizable) and Harden, and to the drab realism created by Clint Eastwood.  I knew, having read about 100 pages of the dreary (in the sense of sadness) novel that this would not be pleasant.But powerful, imaginative acting and style can overcome such hurdles, witness the brilliant 'Unforgiven' and most of Shakepeare's tragedies.BUT ---- SPOILERS!!  PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!Oh come on, one can allow a coincidence or two, but three!? The blame goes to the author (not 'LA Confidential' scripter Brian Hegleland,  unless he altered the book).  In the story, poor Dave waits, what more than 25 years?, then commits a heinous murder at precisely the time the other victim is murdered.  Same day, same time.  And who commits this horrible act, not only a pair of unlikely criminals, but a duo who seem totally unlikely to then chase her and beat her and shoot her a second time!  Two absurdities. But then, of course, the third strike is the misguided act of revenge that occurs JUST before to this case being solved.  
Look, if the set-up is going to be worthy, such contrivances reduce a wonderfully crafted work to a cheat.  Sorry folks, but good luck at Awards Time to the super actors.",7,0,0,18 December 2003
