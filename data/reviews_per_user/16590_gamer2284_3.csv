Raiders of the Lost Ark," a good film
",Raiders of the lost ark was a great action film with a enertaining story with a cool action hero in Indiana Jones and i considered it the benchmark for future action films. One of my favorite scene in the film was when Indy was in the tomb of snakes which he greatly fears and so do i. The special effects in their time were probably state of their art but compared to today the special effects suck. I think the film was great for it's time period and i greatly enjoyed the film it was my favorite action films of all time. The acting was great by all the actors involved with the highlight being Harrison ford as Indiana Jones.,9,0,0,22 May 2012
