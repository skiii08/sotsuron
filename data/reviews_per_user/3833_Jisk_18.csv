Catch Me If You Can," Good, but not great
","While watching Spielberg's new film, I was completely captivated by the naturalness of the performances. Usually, I find the acting in his films to either be syrupy(A.I., Saving P.R) or cartoonish (but good as in Raiders). In this film, the performances felt REAL. I have never experienced that in a Spielberg film, as I have usually felt that the performers were too aware that they have been 'acting'. That is my most usual criticism of his films. This time, I had no problem with it. I loved the acting in this film.    My problem with this film lies with some of the choices Spileberg has made as a director. Spielberg is not notoriously 'stingy' as a director. He usually lets the audience have what they came to his movie for: an emotional experience. While this trend was certainly true early on (think of the final segment of Close Encounters), lately it seems that he is holding back. I won't give away any spoilers, but people who read this might know what I mean. For instance, I walked away from this movie THINKING about it. Not FEELING it but THINKING it through. Did I like that or didn't I? I asked myself. I sure laughed like a loon throughout so surely I enjoyed it, but then why did I feel so dislocated from that experience of it by the end? Spielberg, in my own humble opinion, has been committing 'Shyamalanisms' of late. Definition: A really alienating end to a perfectly wonderful movie; an ending that makes you 'think' but ultimately does nothing to make you 'feel'. 'A.I' did it. 'Wha?' I asked at the ending of that film. Everyone seems to loathe the ending of 'Minority Report' so I won't even go there. And now, with 'Catch' he has completed a trilogy of films which are largely wonderful but leave you with a sense of vagueness/despair.   Don't get me wrong, I liked this film. But I wanted to love it. Spielberg wouldn't let me.",9,1,2,20 January 2003
Minority Report," 'The Fugitive' with jet-packs?
","Spielberg's 'Minority Report' is a passable pot-boiler, wrapped up in the guise of a science fiction film. What keeps it from being great however, is an ending that produces more questions than answers.There are at least three climaxes in this film, and the last one- (the 'unmasking' of the 'Real' villain is a let down.) The set-up with him killing Colin Ferrel's character recalls the scene from 'L.A. Confidential' when the 'boss'-type guy kills the Kevin Spacey character because he has gotten 'too close'.There are a lot of other (intentioal and unintentional) film references in here, not the least of which is 'The Fugitive' with Harrison Ford. In that film, the 'villain' ends up being Ford's 'friend' as it is in this one and Ford publicly 'exposes' him at a conference of sorts where he is to be awarded. The difference here is that there is no exciting 'fight' scene between the two major players (the 'laundry room' sequence in 'Fugitive'. Yet another reason why the end of this film stinks.While certainly not a great movie overall, MR reaches some highs as it goes along. Chiefly among these is the jet-pack sequence and the fight in the car factory. Cruise is also good as the 'cop on the whiff' Chief Anderton and a few stellar cameos create some memorable scenes, most notably Tim Blake Nelson's prison guard and Peter Stormare's 'Eye' surgeon.Not as memorable as 'Blade Runner' or even 'A.I' for that matter. 8/10",7,0,0,20 February 2003
Unbreakable," M. Night is ahead of his time
","M. Night is already one of the most important directors in AmericanCinema history. He is well on his way to being a master of hiscraft, and with 'Unbreakable' he proves how far he is willing to goto believe in his vision, even if many perceive this film to be 'off' ornot that great. I think this is an unusual film, a special film, and arare film. It is beautiful, dense, deliberate, articulate, and haunting.
The bad buzz I have been hearing kind of reminds me of the buzzthat 'Vertigo' receieved when it first came out. 'What the @!#%& isthis? ' many said and balked at Hitchcock's masterpiece. That filmis now one of his most revered works, and one of his moststudied. I believe the future holds well for 'Unbreakable'. I think it isahead of its time, and it will be one of those films that young futuredirectors will  talk about. 'Unbreakable, man. that was the film thatmade me want to be a director.'",8,0,0,13 December 2000
Amistad," masterful, powerful, Hopkins brilliant
","When Amistad originally came out I had zero desire to see it. i don't know exactly why, but I think it had something to do with that other big 'boat' movie that came out then. A small film called 'Titanic'. I even bought a ticket one night to see 'Amistad' but after watching all of two minutes of it, I kept feeling like all I wanted to do was go watch (expletive) 'Titanic' again, so I did. Thankfully, I finally did see this movie, and I am really glad I did. I am a lifelong Spielberg fan (aren't we all), and this I think is one of his best films. Right up there with Schindler's List. It builds beautifully, and the scenes on the ship are memorable to say the least. To me, this film is a joy to watch. It is the master at work. Hard to believe 'Lost World:Jurassic Park' came out the same year (to me his worst film). Anyway, even thought the box-office 'climate' or whatever (Titanic's wake?) washed this film out of theatres, don't miss it. I",7,1,3,29 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," FAILURE ON A GRAND SCALE
","This film is a disaster of cinema on a scale that could probably rank up there with 'Cleopatra' or similar botched attempts at 'epic' cinema. George Lucas has, indeed, 'lost his touch', as some people have said but it could be more easily explained this way: George Lucas has simply decided that the scripts of his STAR WARS prequels don't really matter that much and can be developed 'along the way'. In my opinion, and most REALLY GOOD FILMMAKERS would probably agree, this is ASS BACKWARDS. In LucasLand, apparently, you can start with an 'idea', pay a huge staff of VERY creative graphic artists and painters to design vehicles, make models, choreograph scenes on the computer without ever having seen THE SCRIPT. Don't agree? Check out THE ART OF STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES and you will see pages upon pages of beautiful renderings and designs that were completely wasted on a film with no script. Don't agree? Read the sorry ass excuse for a script at the back of said book. This script is so bad, it is unbelievable. It truly shows how much contempt Lucas has for the written word and this man should never be allowed near a typewriter. If I were one of the designers on this film, or The Phantom Menace for that matter, I would quit. I wouldn't want my BABIES, ships and locales that I slaved over to be used in service of some of the most haphazard and shoddy storytelling this side of Corusant. Don't agree? Watch Anatomy of a Murder. Psycho. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Kramer VS. Kramer. Star Wars. Alien. These films all had one thing in common. Before there was a CHECK cut to anyone, there was a script. Before a date was scheduled, there was a SCRIPT. It's too bad that we give Lucas so much power- somebody really needs to say no to this guy. 'Sorry George,' I would say if I were THAT GUY, 'but you may not start this new series of films until I see AT THE VERY LEAST a script for the FIRST ONE. Oh, and most people do five or so drafts and have other people LOOK AT IT so they can tell you when you are being a dunderhead (Jar Jar, or all of the dialogue in AOTC, for example). THEN AND ONLY THEN MAY YOU COMISSION THE ARTISTS NEEDED TO PULL THIS THING TOGETHER! Not before, no, not before.' Lucas has put the cart before the horse, my friends and so that is why these films are classically bad. We are witnessing failure on a colossal scale. I'm not talking box office. If these films were good, they would be pulling down twice as much- AT LEAST- no, I'm talking about QUALITY. I'm talking about LOVE. WE LOVE STAR WARS because the first ones (or at least the first two) were made with LOVE. Like Grandma's chocolate chip cookies. The new ones? Apparently Grandma's gone crazy and decided to ALTER THE RECIPE. She is now adding the sugar AFTER BAKING THEM. See how crazy it is?",5,0,0,30 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Might be the best of the bunch
","Frankly, I don't know what some of the early critics are talking about. This is an amazing movie in almost every way. It bridges the two series for the first time in ways 'Menace' never could and is more exciting than any Indiana Jones movie. And then there's the special effects....they are by far the best I've ever seen. Not to say there aren't some dull moments- some scenes simply do not click and so therefore the movie isn't perfect? WHO CARES!!! Was 'Empire' PERFECT? NOOOOOOOOOO (I have always found the Dagobah sequence a little boring). 'Jedi' (Jabba laugh)- certainly not. 'Menace'? Let's not even go there. So no, 'Clones' is not perfect and I don't know why some critics feel the need to bag on it when it is so wonderful in so many ways. It's their loss, really, because they decided not to enjoy this film which is so rich and delectible it begs to be enjoyed. In short, the love scenes are not as annoying as some might think. They are actually rather sweet- especially the later ones. Anakin is showing some definite 'Vader-esque' traits here and C3P0 has his best moments yet. It's a wild ride and is just waiting to be enjoyed by every man, woman and child on this planet. AMAZING! 10/10",5,0,0,17 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Sully, meet Cave Troll. Cave Troll, eat Sully!
","Overall a disappointment.Very CG-heavy- fake looking special effects. The Cave Troll isreally good. Legolas is cool.I wish Merry and Pippin didn't lookexactly the same because it took me an hour to figure out whichwas which (also- say Merry's name already will ya'!) Gandalf isterrific. Elijah Wood is so pretty . Too much monsters and fighting.Story is very confusing, I got lost along the way. Couldn't figure outwhere they were going or why. Why send only nine? Why not sendeveryone? Again, the Cave Troll was super-cool, as was theOctopus thingy. All of the elves were pretty. I liked Strider and theother guy...The dwarf I didn't like so much because he remindedme of the troll guy from 'D&D'. The ring is pretty. Why were the F/Xso bad? Some things were good but so much of it looked like abig video game I just got numb to it after awhile. It was really longtoo. Sam is a good friend. Too much like Peter Jackson's loud and obvnoxious 'Frighteners'and not enough like his achingly beautiful 'Heavenly Creatures'.Too many of those long, swooping pan-shots of everything; like inevery scene! Burger King glasses are cool. I got Strider and Arwen(kiss kiss). Statues pretty cool. Elves are pretty. Violent- not toogood for kiddies- scary. Character development shabby- Howcome I don't care more about Frodo? Too many slimy scary-sounding bad guys. Lots of weird cuts- Suddenly we're ontop of the mountain' okay now we are at the entrance to the cave.Murky and amateurish. Not slick at all like 'The Matrix' or 'Ep. I' -both of these film's CG F/X run circles around this movie.
This movie reminded me way too much of Dungeons and Dragons, which was a very bad movie. This is not a very badmovie, it just needed a little less brashness and a little morewhistfulness. The book has a natural, easy charm to it that themovie lacks- it's way too 'hard'. The book is warm and soft, themovie is ice cold.  Parts of it also reminded me of, gulp, 'Shrek'. Ugh. Although I'd like to see Shrek battle that Cave Troll. Cave Trollwould eat Sully for breakfast. Shrek could probably take himthough.",7,0,0,24 December 2001
Batman Begins," Holy Excellent Movie Batman!
","Wow, I was really impressed with this movie. I honestly wasn't expecting all that much, and I can't say that I'm the biggest Batman fan or comic-book movie guy. But that stuff doesn't matter because this was just an excellent movie - simple as that. The story was tight and the plot moved along quickly - quite a feat considering its long running length - there could have been many dead spots, but there wasn't a wasted frame in that movie; every shot, every scene, told another part of the story - the hallmark of great storytelling. The special effects were amazing; I was particularly impressed with the shots of the city, and the train especially. I think I even said 'Wow' out loud. I probably do that a lot, but after having scene 'Revenge of the Sith' three times this summer and 'War of the Worlds' once, I can honestly say that this is a better film than both of those and deserves to be rated as highly as it is in the IMDb charts.One surprising thing about this movie was how genuinely scary the 'halluciation' scenes were; I felt a little woozy myself after the first time Crane used it on the bad dude. The best part was when Batman used it on him and looked like a black, oozing demon - awesome, scary stuff!The performances were also terrific (and how about that cast!!!); everyone seemed to be on board with the gritty, realistic tone Nolan was going for - It was a gamble, considering how far removed from the neon-glow world of the last couple of Batman films it was, but it was a strong, confident choice for the design, look, tone and 'reality' of this film, which presented us with a much more realistic (and believable) Batman than ever before.The ending was also great, because it set up the 'reality' of the Batman we are used to: Bruce Wayne, Alfred, (soon to be) Commissioner Gordon, future enemies, etc. - this reality, however, is now infused with this gritty sense of reality this film brings. Excellent! I'm looking forward to Batman Returns, I mean, Batman Continues (or whatever they decide to call it...)",9,1,2,20 July 2005
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I wish I could jump on the bandwagon, but...
","When seeing a film that you have read about, and it has beencalled 'great', and hyperboles have been used such as '...thegreatest film of all time', it is hard to separate what you thoughtabout it from the critical reaction. I think there is an urge to reallywant to go with the crowd and join the praise. It feels good to bandtogether and unanimously cheer something.  When 'Unbreakable'came out there was a deafening silence about that movie. Nobodyknew what to think of it! Then someone said.....'this movie sucks!'and like a pin to a balloon the condemnation slapped that moviesilly and it disappeared from theatres, and from Oscar hopes.
     Now with the universal praise of CTHD almost as deafening, Ihave to raise my little hand up in the air and speak my little piece oftruth which is.....what the he!! are these critics talking about? Goodmovie? yes. Great movie? no. Disappointing movie? YES. (herecomes the tirade) I was extremely disappointed with this movie!Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors and this movie just totallylacks drama, man! It's like, kind of boring. I don't understand themotivations of any of the characters and the pacing is dull, the fightscenes come out of nowhere and don't resolve anything! They'recool to watch but they don't really move the story, the drama, andthe action forward. I hate that! And from Ang Lee too! Whomastered drama with 'The Ice Storm', subtle comedy with 'Senseand Sensibility', human frailty and realism with 'The WeddingBanquet', and building suspense with 'Ride With the Devil'. All ofthose movies do something better than this one. I just wasn'tmoved at all. Perhaps it would communicate more meaning to aChinese audience..(well, those subtitles were kind of distracting)..Idon't know. I just wished it were better. Or maybe it's just that I wasweaned on the overpowering Spielberg/John Williams 'we aregoing to MAKE you cry, laugh, squirm, etc..' formula and can'taccept something subtler and finer. I'll still probably buy it on DVDso I can watch it without the annoying subtitles! My reaction to thismovie reminds me of my reaction to 'Princess Mononoke'. Amidstdeafening applause I sat there silently and asked, am I just adum-dum? did I miss something? did that movie make anydamned sense at all? Anyway , end of tirade. Maybe Ang could justexplain it to me. I hate feeling left out of the crowd. Maybe then Icould join the universal cheer and root for him to beat 'Gladiator' onOscar night. (In my heart though I still love Unbreakable- GoNight!!)",8,0,0,29 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," WOW...I mean...WOW...
","WOW...There are almost no words to say about this film- it's that good. It takes what happened in the first film and multiplies EVERYTHING by ten. The stakesare higher, the action is stronger, more intense and intriguing and thecharacters are deepened. This has to be the best sequel since 'The EmpireStrikes Back'. It is that much deeper than the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring'- as 'Empire' is much deeper in scope than the original 'Star Wars'.       Character-wise, if 'Fellowship' was Gandalf's film, this is Aragorn's film. Viggo Mortensen's intensely good performance gets better here as his love for the elvin Arwen is put in jeopardy. Everything in this movie works. Gollum is an amazing presence. He is the anti Jar-Jar. Gollum is the first CG character to accomplish the feat of forgetting that he is a CG character. His 'schizo' scenes are especially effective. Frodo also deepens and Elijah Wood is able to showmore of his acting chops as the ring begins taking control. Merry and Pippen are also put to better use here, as they meet up with perhaps the strangest and most magical character in the film. The visuals too are spectacular, especially at the battle for Helm's Deep- probably the best castle-siege scene ever put ontocelluloid. The lingering problems with the first film disappear here as the story deepens. This is going to go down as the best trilogy ever- better than the first Star Wars Tril. (but influenced by it- as that trilogy was influenced by these books)- and MUCH better than the NEW 'Star Wars' trilogy (ie. BAD Star Warstrilogy) --While 'Attack of the Clones' takes the story given to us in 'ThePhantom Menace' and mangles it and gives it back to us unrecognizable, thisfilm takes what was there (from 'Fellowship') and beautifies it, expands upon it, and gives us the 'bridge' in what will surely be an amazing trilogy.",9,0,0,18 December 2002
Back to the Future Part III," A bit lackluster
","Apparently time travel has become so mundane, so commonplace now for Marty McFly that it doesn't really even faze him that he has been sent back to the wild west. Fox looks bloated and bored in this one, and the story is obviously wearing thin. Also, Biff Tannen provided such a wonderful villian in the first two, why not try something new? Nope. Instead we have 'Mad Dog' Tannen saying (from across the saloon) 'Hey McFly!'. Sorry, but what was fresh in the first one and somewhat fresh in the second is now stale here. That being said, there is still some fun to be had. The train sequence is Grrreat!!! Marty is peculiarly droll and mellow in this one (why?) but it works occasionally for some laughs ('Frisbee! Far out!'). The Doc love story is nice too. It's not awful, it's just ho hum-- kind of a fizzle-y way to end the series...or is it the end after all???",8,0,1,7 October 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Better than 'V: The Final Battle'!
","Ha ha, just kidding. Of course it is, but this cliff-hanger ending certainly makes it feel like a soap opera/sci-fi/mini-series. With regards to the film, I have to say that although it is not high art, it is entertaining. I had a great time and just tuned out when the sci-fi Star Trek talk got too laborious. I have to say though, I didn't love this film like I did the first one. I wasn't blown away. It really did seem like the TV series version of a really good movie. Now we have to wait until next season (Revolutions) to see what happens- which by the way I THINK I KNOW BUT I'M NOT TELLING!Trinity is beyond hot- every man's dream. Warm, beautiful, caring, sexy, kicks ass- Neo is a lucky savior indeed. I have to say though, my favorite character was Link. He was the most human and has a great line- ('Where's my...) Nope, won't give that one away either. Good story but not as universally appealing as the first one. Kind of like the new Star Wars movies or just Star Trek in general. Better than Attack of the Clones by far but nowhere near as good as Two Towers- (not much is).
Can't really judge this one until we see part two- (I mean three but part two of this 'series'). See you in November. 7/10",7,0,0,19 May 2003
Love Actually," Actually pretty good.
","I just watched this Christmas-y movie with my wife and it was actually pretty enjoyable and not too bad at all. I liked the Hugh Grant character the best but I also liked the Colin Firth character. There were a few too many 'cutesy' scenes in it - and the Liam Neeson story with the young boy was too similar to 'About a Boy,' which also had Hugh Grant - adding to that 'seen it before' feeling.
         There was a few nice surprises here though and it is a good date movie. Annoyingly, some of the plot threads go unresolved at the end - but overall an enjoyable flick. Curtis & Co. are perfecting this British romantic comedy thing, and I thought that the idea of making American president a bully was great -ballsy too. I liked that a lot. Charming, fairly lightweight film about love and relationships - not as fluffy as it might be. 3 stars.",9,0,1,15 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Simply Amazing!
","After watching the 'Clone Wars' cartoon series (not to mention the previous two prequels), I was prepared to be fairly blown away by this movie - and I wasn't - initially. I saw it on opening night and was so nervous that it was going to have that cheesy dialogue and pointless, unbelievable moments like the last ones, but I was wrong. Overall, it was a solid film - I thoroughly enjoyed it - but I still felt like I wanted more. Anyway, I went back and saw it again today (about a week and a half later) and I have to say, that this time, I was ready to just sit back, relax, and enjoy it even more - and I DID. From the opening crawl to the final moment, I was absolutely enthralled. What a sad, compelling, forceful, incredible film! I had my doubts going in, but I have to say that I think this movie will play for years to come. It's probably right behind EMPIRE as my favorite SW film. There was only one weak moment in the film as far as I'm concerned, and that is the scene where Anakin pledges himself to Sidious. That was a little weak and it was a little unbelievable - his actions that came next. But by the end of the film (the final battle) I was so sold on him having turned that I didn't mind so much. It's a weak point, but it doesn't ruin the film. All I can say is, thank you George Lucas! You delivered a satisfying, excellent film! Good Job!10/10",7,3,8,28 May 2005
Back to the Future Part II," wacky and crazy
","A wacky, crazy, very fun kind of movie with only some remnants of the kind of heart the first movie had. That said though, it is immensely entertaining. It may even be more fun to watch at this point than the first one, and maybe that's because so much of the first one is included in this one anyway, it's sort of like bonus edition. There are some genuine thrills here too as the sports almanac Biff vs. Marty plot device really pays off nicely. The only sad thing about this one is that it turns ends with a cliff hanger and a preview of part three. A terrible way to end a film (I think). This plus the zany multiple universe-time-travel-happiness of this movie gives it a sort of schizo feel, but again, it's super fun to watch again. A great, probably underrated series.",7,1,2,7 October 2001
Vanilla Sky," Candy coated A.I. wannabe
","What an ugly mug that Tom Cruise sports in close up after close up in this supposedly intelligent 'thriller'. It is all hopeless to describe and pointless to write about. This is because it is about a character who is so despicable, we WANT him to die! You mean he survived again? GGRRRR! There has never been so much TOM CRUISE in one movie and he can not carry this thing because he is not likable- hardly at all in real life, even less so in this film. The ending is the only thing which really makes this film at all worth seeing but it plays like a long, LONG version of an episode of the Twilight Zone. There is also an element of Spielberg's 'A.I' in here as well as Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut'. In 'A.I.', the main character is also named David and it also ends with a gonzo whopper of a sci-fi finale. Unfortunately for this film, 'A.I.' also had two interesting acts previous to the last one, which this film does not have. Not to strain the Spielberg connection too much, but the guy makes a cameo in 'Vanilla Sky'(why?).All of that said, there are some creepy moments but unfortunately they add up to nil. Also, Cameron Crowe's trademark 'alternative' sounding rock soundtrack finally spoils the party. Finally when things are getting interesting I hear Sinead O' Connor and I think, 'Oh, this is from that album that bombed'. I am taken out of the story just when it is getting good (at two hours +). Watch this one on late night cable when you are alone in your motel room at the 'Red Roof Inn' and have nothing better to do. Actually, scratch that. At the 'Red Roof Inn' you can play Nintendo for 8.50 an hour. THAT would be money well spent.",7,0,0,27 December 2001
Incredibles 2," Lacks the INCREDIBLE-ness of the original
","Incredibles 2 is not a bad movie, per se, but it does not exactly take off the way the first one did. There was so much originality and genuine surprise in the first one and this one has little of that. The same great characters are there but the circumstances they have to face in this one are nowhere near as cool or interesting as in the first movie. There are a lot of nice moments here but they just don't add up to as compelling a narrative as we had in the first one. Which is too bad. They spend a lot of time and energy on the whole 'should supers be illegal or legal' or not idea, and frankly I don't think the audience really cares too much about that. We've had X-Men movies and Watchmen traverse this exact same territory and the villain in this one is no Syndrome. So on the whole the film, especially if you are a fan of the first, is a bit of a letdown. There are some new supers here but they don't get much screen time. The most interesting 'new' development is the discovery of jack jacks powers, which lead to the films most spontaneous moments. Which is too bad because Incredibles deserved better IMO.",7,3,4,15 November 2019
Pocahontas," Better than people give it credit for
","When Pocahontas originally came out, Disney's wave of recent hits came to a crashing halt. The film was labeled as racist or at least insensitive to Native Americans and the goodwill that Disney had established with its audiences quickly evaporated. You could say they have never been the same since. The 'fearsome foursome' that is The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and the Lion King has no equal, except perhaps the last four Pixar movies. Pocahontas is not, unfortunately in that 'club' and never will be. Disney spent the next four to five years trying to recreate the 'magic' with films like Hunchback, Hercules, Mulan, and Tarzan. Unfortunately, none of those films had the surprise and 'good feeling' of the earlier Disney hits, and except for maybe Mulan, none of those films, as films, were as good either. And although Pocahontas is and was the point where the schizm occurred, in retrospect, it's a pretty damned good movie. So what went wrong?First, it wasn't the Lion King. They could have put out something 'safe' after the Lion King, and it still probably would have paled in comparison to what was then a great big giant behemoth of a movie. That movie earned over THREE HUNDRED MILLION in its theatrical run in 1994 - not as common then as it is now - thing was a juggernaut. Pocahontas, following on the heels of this bad boy, was not going to live up to expectations. People blamed the fact that it was about PEOPLE and not animals, and that it was based on ACTUAL history rather than a fairy tale. THEN they blamed the fact that the history part of it was botched and that the film's portrayal of Native Americans was at best insensitive, racist at worst. I'll grant you that making Pocahontas' mentor a talking tree and having her learn English 'instantaneously' because she listened to her heart is a wee bit ridiculous, but racist? Come on. The message of the film - that love can conquer hate - is anything but racist and if anything, the film shows the 'Indians' in a more human light than the English, who are their usual, stereotypical pig-headed selves. Here's what else is good about the movie: The SONGS. Remember 'Colors of the Wind'? Could there be a better song about reconnecting with nature and valuing the earth more? We NEED this song right now, especially, with the world seemingly sliding ever more into a consumerist 'bliss,' what better than to see some beautiful chick running through the forest teaching that rugged white man how to value LIFE? And what the hell is wrong with that I ask? And what about some of the other songs? The one about the RIVER BEND and making choices - good stuff. And the whole montage ending song that repeats SAVAGES SAVAGES BARELY EVEN HUMAN from both sides - showing that BOTH SIDES misunderstand each other. It gives me chills when Pocahontas is running and you see the war superimposed behind her and she sings 'HOW LOUD BEAT THE DRUMS OF WAR!' - makes me want to cry! Don't we need this now I ask you?But, by far the best thing about this movie is - the animation. It is absolutely GORGEOUS. The design for this film is sumptuous, with mostly blues and a seamless style that never gets in the way and illustrates the action (and the feminine nature of the film) so beautifully. Compared to the dreck that is the HUNCHBACK - that film is ugly as sin - and the absolute HIDEOUSNESS of Hercules - the animation in that is strictly straight-to-video, Pocahontas absolutely ROCKS. Only Mulan, with its chirpy story and colorful style match up to the grandeur of this one. While Pocahontas didn't have the grand ending that the Lion King had (it was a downer, remember?), the story bucks tradition by making it about people instead of animals, and its' message outweighs the 'historically inaccurate' complaint. What movie IS historically accurate? Disney took a chance with this one and they got BURNED, which is why they went back to doing 'safe' crap like Hunchback, which tanked anyway. They should have done the SCARLET LETTER or something like that - really start pissing people off. How about the MARQUIS DE SADE? There's some history for you!Watch Pocahontas again without the weight of expectations. You'll be surprised by how good it really is.",7,265,311,6 August 2005
