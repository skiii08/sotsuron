The King's Speech," Beautifully shot and superbly acted yet at times I thought the story was a little slow and at times boring.
","The King's Speech stars Colin Firth as King George VI and Geoffery Rush as his speech therapist Lionel Logue. The film follows King George VI's, or Bertie's, rise to become King of England, and his struggle with his speech impediment while also dealing with the life of being in the Royal Family. All the while the beginning of World War II is lingering in the background providing for much of the political side of the film.The direction of the film was brilliantly done by Tom Hooper, especially during the scenes between Firth and Rush. Most of the scenes are just simple conversations between the two but Hooper creates this beautiful environment, often in Lionel's office, reminding me a lot of a painting, or perhaps a portrait to more accurate. He also excels during George's speeches to the public by really creating a sense of anxiety in the audience that George himself is feeling with his speech impediment. Most of all, he captures the post World War II England beautifully immersing you into the environment.The most impressive aspect of The King's Speech by far is the cast. Firth is at his absolute best as King George VI and won the much deserved Best Actor Oscar. He brings out George's strong, stubborn personality while also showing his vulnerability while very realistically speaking with a stutter. The best scenes with Firth are during his sessions with his speech therapist, Geoffery Rush. They play off each other so well during these scenes and they are only strengthened by Hooper's direction. Helena Bonham Carter plays Queen Elizabeth and as always is a strong presence on the screen that only aides Firth's performance as the King. Guy Pearce also shows up a little during the film, as George's brother Edward, or King Edward for a small stint, and proves that once again (Animal Kingdom) that he can keep up with high caliber performers.The story itself is where I felt The King's Speech was faulty, and it may not be fair to just say it's the King's Speech or just any historical film in general. The scenes between Firth and Rush are incredibly well done and pretty fun to watch on screen. However the scenes that are in between are where I feel it slows down and I found myself just wanting Rush to come back on screen. I do understand that those scenes are important to the character development of George because they mainly deal with the Royal Family, but I just found them to be too boring.Overall, The King's Speech is very well made film and in terms of a historical biography, it does it's job. I just found it dull at times but luckily the direction and casting was enough to keep me entertained and interested in the characters. I did enjoy the inside look it gave at the Royal Family, and especially what their role is in politics. The pressure and stress that simply being born in to a family is a pretty unbelievable thought. Being born into royalty and the pressure that not only comes from your family, but The Royal Family at that. It's well worth a viewing even if it's only to just see the performances, but as a film on the whole I thought it failed with the overall story and it's not the production's fault, I just think the source material wasn't really there to begin with. I felt like I was watching a history textbook and that's the kind of material I try to escape when watching a movie.",8,0,1,23 March 2011
Black Swan," Creepy, Emotinoal, So Sexy, and Intense
","Creepy, Emotional, so Sexy, and Incredibly Intense. As I'm writing this I just got out of the movie 10 minutes ago and am just utterly blown away from this film. Aronofsky is on top of his game like never before, I think this may even be better than Requiem. Natalie Portman is just awesome as Nina the star ballerina ...of Swan Lake. From the beginning your right there with her feeling how much she wants the role and how much pressure she feels when she gets it, all through Aronofsky's direction. He utilizes the extreme close up on the cast's face so much you can't help but feel the emotions they are going through but this is especially felt with Portman. She plays the naive, almost childish girl so well as you watch her transform into the Black Swan its an emotional roller coaster that you can't turn away from. The supporting cast is great. Vincent Cassel is great as the creepy head of production, a character that everyone has seen before, yet he plays it so well its almost like watching the character for the first time. Then you have Barbara Hershey who plays a Hitchcockian mother to the T who is obsessed with her daughter (Portman) to get the role and succeeding. Mila Kunis would be considered the weakest role of the three supporters but that's not saying she's bad by any means, its just everyone else is that good. In my eyes she can't do anything bad, I may just be in love with her... and could use a little more of the scene between her and Portman and if you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. Then running up the cast is Winona Ryder, who is really only on screen for a total of 15 minutes maybe but I will say she plays the crazy, sore loser very well and provides the film with possibly one of the most terrifying scenes in the movie. The story is so compelling and so freaking creepy at the same time. Aronofsky plays with the story of a girl training and performing the Swan Lake Ballet while at the same time telling a contemporary version of Swan Lake in the setting of NYC with a twist of the supernatural. It's an unbelievably well made film and worth seeing, seeing even multiple times. If your in the mood for something a little off the beaten path, unconventional and a psychological thriller/horror than do yourself a favor and don't wait for DVD/Blu-Ray to see this one. It will blow your damn mind.",10,3,6,8 January 2011
127 Hours," Beyond Inspirational, Superbly Directed and Brilliantly Acted
","Just finished watching 127 Hours, I still have the credits and song playing in the background. Kind of speechless right now with what I just watched. I feel like I was trapped in a canyon with my arm stuck. Where to start.Boyle is on top of his game with this one and right away you can tell its a Danny Boyle movie. It has fast cuts, hand held camera work and a beautifully appropriate constructed soundtrack. Using all these tools he places you right in Aaron Ralston shoes, and they are not the shoes you want to be in. We are introduced to Aaron, played by Franco, getting ready for a hiking expedition and his journey as he gets there. He rides his bike 17 miles, locks it up and then hikes running into two girl hikers. He helps them on their way and shows them a ton of fun. Through the prelude here, we see that Aaron is a fun loving guy, living for the thrill of living, the rush, he just wants to be outdoors, which will ultimately put him through hell. I thought this had one of the better preludes of a film in a while, with upbeat music, beautifully shot scenery, your ready to join him yourself. It's not until a rock falls and is lodged between the canyon wall and his arm are we shown the title 127 Hours, and with Franco's terrified face. Just an awesome shot, and really all we need to see to understand what is to come.For the next Hour and fifteen minutes we are with Aaron, stuck. We are dealing with Aaron's mortality, and thus thinking of our own. From here Boyle direction and Franco's acting places you in the canyon. He uses extreme close ups on Franco's face repeatedly to instill a sense of claustrophobia and fear (this more so due to Franco's acting). There are even shots from the inside of his thermos and camel back, placing you in Aaron's mind. Imagining the water flowing to you and becoming less and less. There are few times he will use a shot that pans back from the canyon and displays the empty desert creating for the audience Aaron's loneliness and crushing reality of his surroundings. The sound was an especially well done aspect, specifically with the water. Boyle cranks up the sound of the water sloshing around in the thermos, or going through the hose in the camel back, you'll actually get thirsty while watching. While Boyle places the audience in the canyon with his direction the writing and Franco make us start to deal with our own mortality.Throughout the time in the canyon, you are constantly shown flashbacks and memories of Aaron's leading up to the event. He starts out with what we all would start with, regret about not telling anyone where he was going, what he should have brought with him, etc. As time goes on he starts to think about life, how he treated people that he loved, and what he's leaving behind. Up until the climatic vision that gives him the strength to survive. And really who wouldn't be doing this. He constantly is keeping record on his video camera, keeping his own sanity as well as the audience's. Really the whole time you are thinking that that's probably what you yourself would be doing and thinking thus really making you think about your own life.Its an extremely powerful film. Inspirational, depressing, scary, and the climax of the film is grotesquely real. Its such an unbelievable amazing true story of survival and what the human body and mind are capable of. I'd say go out and enjoy it, but I don't know if enjoy is the right word. I can guarantee that you will be moved and inspired by this film due to Boyles direction, Franco's acting, and of course the real Aaron Ralston.",10,0,3,16 January 2011
Unknown," An interesting and compelling idea for a film that is extremely well acted yet doesn't deliver on the narrative side
","An interesting and compelling idea for a film that is extremely well acted yet doesn't deliver on the narrative side. Unknown follows a couple in Berlin, Dr. Martin Harris, played by Liam Neeson, and Elizabeth Harris, played by the jaw-dropping January Jones. Martin is a scientist and is in Berlin to speak at a Bio Tech Summit and his wife is just tagging along. When they arrive at the hotel, Martin realizes that he left his briefcase at the airport with his passport in it. He hails a cab with Diane Kruger driving and on the way there gets in an accident and is in a coma for four days. When Martin awakes and finally finds his wife, she doesn't know who he is, another Martin Harris is with her that she says is her husband and he can not provide any real ID that says he's Martin Harris. What's nice here is that this all happens within 15 minutes after the opening credits. There's no time wasted on developing the problem and thus creating suspense and fear from the start. From here he tries to figure out what's going on, is he crazy? is there something more going on?, while also believing he is being followed. I don't want to say much more than that at this point because I don't want to give anything away.The cast is great here. Liam Neeson is good no matter what role he's doing (well maybe not Zeus), and he's in familiar territory here playing a much tamer version of his role from Taken. I haven't seen much of January Jones, well I haven't seen much of her acting I guess is more appropriate, but after this I am very excited to check out Mad Men as well as being that much more pumped to see the new X-Men. Diane Kruger plays the cab driver that crashes and causes Martin's coma, however she becomes an integral character further in the storyline. As for Langella, he plays one of Martin's friends that could potentially help him provide proof of his identity, but he only really shows up for about 15 minutes towards the end of the film. It's a very strong cast but it loses itself in the pacing and narrative of the story itself.The director, Jaume Collet-Serra, is a little over his head on this one, with some of his past credits including the remake of House of Wax and Orphan. He does do a very nice job in the first half of the film showing the anxiety and fear of Martin not knowing if he really is Martin while being in an unfamiliar location. Where he fails is through his pacing. The film feels very boring and somewhat predictable (which could accredited more to the trailer, I pretty much had it figured it out from the previews and that should never happen). The action scenes are few and far between and don't really deliver. There is one decent car chase scene and the final fight scene is very well done and a lot of fun to watch, but others are just forgettable. Then in between the action scenes Collet-Serra slows it down too much with the mystery part of the story instead of trying to make the it more suspenseful with the answer slowing coming to be. Instead he hits you with the solution all in one scene and to be honest I was a little let down by it. I feel like it was pretty anti-climatic but that's all I can really say without giving anything away.The idea behind the story is very interesting and could be extremely compelling but it just wasn't delivered very well here. The first act is exciting and full of what the hell is going on moments but after that it's pretty weak until the finale. Also, some of the scenes are very reminiscent of Taken and makes me think that they are just trying to get in on the Taken money. I mean its Liam Neeson, in a foreign country, looking for answers and fighting a bunch of people in between. It not quite worth the theater admission but worth the wait for Blu-ray/DVD, right around the time when you'll forget the trailers that showed way too much information. But if you're a fan of a good mystery and a Neeson fan I recommend it. You might be slightly bored in the middle part of the film, but just remember that January Jones will be back on screen momentarily.",6,1,3,2 March 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," A unconventional love story that is thought-provoking, well acted, and extremely entertaining.
","The Adjustment Bureau stars Matt Damon, as David Norris, an up and coming congressman of New York, and Emily Blunt, as Elise Sellas, a rising professional dancer. The story follows David, who is in the middle of campaigning for a Senator seat for New York, and on the night of the election he finds that he has lost and must deliver his concession speech. When he stops into the bathroom he unexpectedly runs into Elise, who is hiding from security because she was caught crashing a wedding in the same hotel, they immediately feel something strong for each other. We are also introduced to the mysterious group of men that are always watching behind the scenes, with notebooks, business clothes from the 60s, and most importantly a fedora. Without going into too much detail about who they are and what they do, because that would really ruin a pretty fun and intriguing part of the whole story, they essentially make sure that everything goes as planned (Every person has a certain path, and their job is to make sure everyone stays on course. There are strong religious themes here however the film does a pretty good job I think of addressing those themes). However because of a mistake from one of their own, David is shown their world and was never suppose to see Elise after the night of his concession speech thus creating the motivating drive of the film.George Nolfi has shown that he can both write and direct, mostly direct, an intriguing, well made film with power house stars like Damon and Blunt. His direction of New York City is very well done, and he really excels with the many on-foot chase sequences throughout the film. Where he really shows his strengths however is in the dialogue between Damon and Blunt. It's extremely witty and humorous, with a touch of romance and his words are brought to life brilliantly by his two lead actors. All the while he intertwines the love story with the science fiction aspect of the Adjustment Bureau and the mystery surrounding this powerful, all seeing, all controlling group. The cast is excellent and I can't picture anyone else in the roles of David Norris or Elise Sellas. The simple dialogue scenes between these two are just as entertaining, if not better, than the suspenseful and/or action packed scenes throughout the film. Damon is great, but no real surprise there. And Blunt was right up there with him, now if that's because I'm in awe of her sheer beauty with an accent to top it off, I cant really say, but I thought she was great none the less. Overall it's a very good film and one of the better stories that have come along since Inception (unfortunately Nolfi can't be credited for an original story here because he based it on Philip K. Dick's short story). My only real problem with the film that I didn't like was the ending, which is pretty unfortunate because up until that point it was almost flawless. It's a bit anti climatic, however I can't see how you would end it any other way and have it still work with the overall story. Bottom line though, the film really makes you think about the idea of fate versus choice and if we really have a say in our future. Whether you believe in a higher power or not, these ideas are prevalent and will always be an important topic to discuss and the film does a pretty good job of asking questions and giving some answers while also leaving enough open for discussion. All in all it's the perfect film for all audience's, both male and female, young or old and one that relies more on it's acting and story than it's special effects like most film now a days, and that in itself is something worth seeing.",9,1,1,4 April 2011
Limitless," Visually exhilarating and well acted, yet I felt it missed the mark to make it a really thought-provoking and substantial film.
","Visually exhilarating and well acted, yet I felt it missed the mark to make it a really thought-provoking and substantial film. The idea behind Limitless is simple and in itself extremely intriguing. What if there was a pill you could take that would make you capable of anything without feeling any kind of negative emotions like stress or anxiety, would you take it without knowing the full consequences? Pretty cool idea right and one of those questions that could be debated over for hours and Limitless does a decent job with the overall premise but I felt it didn't quite go far enough into the morality and the humanity of taking such a pill and focused instead too much on the entertaining aspects such as paranoia, making tons of money, being witty and charming, etc.Bradley Cooper stars as Eddie Morra, a failure of a writer, recently dumped, and insanely depressed, who surprisingly runs into an old friend who gives him this special pill, NZT, that can access the remaining parts of your brain that lay dormant. This essentially is all you need to know (unfortunately the trailers pretty much tell you most of the film anyway) in order to understand what is going on. He starts to write, succeed with women, make millions, etc. all the while taking the pill, that is until some of his prior bad decisions as well as side effects of the pill start showing up.The direction, done by Neil Bruger (One of his past films is The Illusionist, if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it), is very well done, making Limitless one of the more visually, psychologically compelling films I've seen. He captures the feeling of the pill very well on screen and really excels as a director during a lot of the fast paced sequences. Leslie Dixon wrote the screenplay and deserves a lot of credit because it is mainly a dialogue driven film, however it is probably fair to assume that all of the credit goes to Alan Glynn who wrote the novel which this based on. However, where she faults is with the overall story itself. She at times seems like she can't figure out if she wants to write a film about the drug and what you can do with the drug, or the consequences of taking such a drug and the moral and human issues that come along with it. Dixon does succeed however with her dialogue, which is fast, witty, always entertaining, and who better to deliver than Bradley Cooper.Cooper is excellent as Eddie Morra and if there was any doubt that he could lead a film he's wiped it all away with this. He plays both sides of the character very well, the failure and the successful side and shows that he can not only do the comedy, fast talking, witty character that we all know he can do, but he can also pull off the dramatic side as well. As for DeNiro, he only shows up so that an older audience will go to see it. He plays a pretty important role, but not one that needs the acting chops of someone like Robert DeNiro (however maybe this is just more proof that he's slipping and is losing what he once was). Abbie Cornish also shows up as Eddie Morra's girlfriend throughout the movie, and is one of the character's I wish would have been present more on screen, mainly to help with what I thought was the only fault of the entire film.What Limitless lacks is the debate between what would people do if there was a drug that could help you accomplish your wildest dreams. The idea of a drug being able to do that is never really discussed nor is the idea of addiction, what it means for people around you, all the things that are usually brought up in a drug film. And what a better film to discuss these questions than with a story about a drug that makes you and your ideas, excuse the obvious use of the title but, limitless. What an awesome question of humanity, what if you could be perfect? How much time would you hesitate to try the pill, what would you do to get more, etc? Some of these questions are briefly touched upon and answered but not to the depth that they deserve. Instead the film aims to please the masses, with entertaining yet mentally boring action and dialogue. To make matters slightly worse, the ending doesn't help. Your left with a couple of pretty big questions and it leaves you hanging. However, I did like the ending and always will take a film that ends unconventionally and you wanting more than one that wraps everything up nicely and sends you on your way. It's one of those endings where as soon as the credits role your left discussing what you think happened, which in my book is a success. If you can get people talking about your film, and not just what scene they liked the best, or what song was in it, but a real conversation about the story, that is a huge accomplishment and one I hope to see more film makers try to do.",7,0,1,10 April 2011
The Fighter," Superbly Acted, Inspiring, and Uplifting.
","Even though after watching the trailer for The Fighter I knew essentially the whole story and how it ended (the reason I only gave it a 9 was the predictability of the story), I was still thoroughly entertained for the duration. And this can mainly be credited to the strong performances for really the whole cast. Bale is a shoe in for an Oscar. Already got the golden globe, and I don't see anyone else even coming close to his performance. Aside from Bales physical appearance like his drop in weight, at the end of the film, during the credits,they have the real Mickey and Dickey, and Bale is almost a damn clone of the real Dickey. The performance is so strong, you pretty much hate Dickey for a lot of the film, yet you feel almost sorry for him in a pathetic kind of way, and then end up cheering for him towards the end.Wahlberg gives possibly his best performance of his career. This was a great move for him because lately he's been having a lot of duds. Personally I thought he wasn't even all that good in The Good Guys and that was probably his best film since The Departed. The two female leads, Amy Adams plays Wahlberg's girlfriend and Melissa Leo who plays his Mom and Manager, are great as well. Adams is great as the strong, inspiring girlfriend that gets Wahlberg out from the hole that is his family, but that's no surprise. And Leo will be getting some good roles coming her way, she was the least likable character on the screen, somewhat similar to Amy Ryan's Mom in Gone Baby Gone. As for O'Russell he did a great job directing the film, especially with his choice of cinematography. The majority of the film is filmed with hand held cameras, giving it a very documentary and realistic feel. He also takes real home videos of the Dickey and Mickey as well as cutting to real rights from HBO to make the story that much more authentic, creating an even more heartfelt experience for the audience always being reminded that this is a true story. During the actual boxing matches he uses footage from HBO and the only voices that can be heard are the crowds and announcers placing you in real time with the match, unexpectedly watching. Overall its a phenomenal character story, driven by the actors and actresses. The story is predictable, yet I almost cheered myself a couple of times during the matches. It definitely worth a watch, especially if your a Christian Bale fan, its an unbelievable performance and without a doubt the Oscar winner for best supporting actor. I would see it again and recommend you do as well, at least once.",9,2,3,22 January 2011
