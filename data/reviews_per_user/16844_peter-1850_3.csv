Mission: Impossible III," Somebody should tell Mr Cruise that he can't act
","This is a pitiful excuse for a film. Surely with all the money they had they could employ somebody who could act! Mr Cruise is utterly wooden and unconvincing. You'd expect amateur children to do a better job of acting.The plot is ridiculously thin, the action lacks all credibility. Tom Thumb would be a good nickname for the little runt who has the lead part - nobody would believe that a wimp like that would be involved in any of the things he does.The explosions and shootouts are badly done - the baddies fire hundreds of round and always miss the goodies hit nearly every time.Don't waste your money on this rubbish.",1,19,38,14 May 2006
The Hunger Games," A mediocre idea that could have been made into a good film - but this is not it.
","A mediocre idea that could have been made into a good film - but this is not it.Watching 'Hunger Games'. Pity about the Apple-loops excuse for music. Nice to have it all so predictable - perfect watching for Alzheimer's patients. What a horrifying film, though, far, far, in the future and humanity hasn't evolved beyond 'reality' plebvision....Isn't it fortunate that, as Yogi Berra pointed out, 'It's difficult to make predictions, particularly about the future'.Pathetic, really. They don't even know what 'star crossed' means. How sad, they could have made an interesting film, instead of this tosh. I thought, for a while, that it might be anti-fascism, instead it was a bad modern re-make of 'Triumph of the Will'. Yankland Ãœber alles in der Welt'. Well, I suppose that you have to accept that it reflects the Zeitgeist. I think that Neitzche, if shorn of all his aesthetic sensibilities, might have liked it.What is worst about the whole thing, really, is that such a badly made, fascist film is so popular - if it had just gone straight to DVD, where it belongs, it wouldn't be such a sad indictment on popular taste and popular sentiment (sentimentality, really). I suppose that we have to accept that, like the depression in the 1930s, this depression has, almost inevitably, led to an adoption of fascist mawkishness. Wouldn't it be nice if humanity was capable of something better.",1,4,6,29 August 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Self-indulgent rip-off
","We went to see this today. It's a long film, with far too much time spent in boring fight sequences. The plot is peculiar and convoluted to say the least.Sadly, too, there is little novelty here. The same old characters, mainly, continue in the same old way.If you enjoyed the previous two films, then there is much to enjoy here, it is fun, but it leaves you much less satisfied than before.I was surprised, and impressed, that Captain Sparrow appears to be something of a classicist, or lawyer as, at one point, and aptly, he says 'res ipse loquitur' and there are no sub-titles to interpret the remark. Could this lead to more children taking an interest in Latin? If so, three cheers to the film, that sort of intellectually enriching stuff is seldom seen, or, rather, heard, in a Hollywood film.There are some amazingly sloppy anachronisms, though. Early in the film a child sings before being executed, and shows us that he is undergoing modern orthodontic treatment. It'd have been easy to conceal his braces, or, better, to have used another child. Is this just laziness, or is it a deliberate signal that they're taking the peess out of the audience because they don't care as long as they get the money - or is there some excuse that it's a 'post-modernist' piece of deliberate rubbish (relabelled because of IMDb yankish puritanism)?Some scenes appear to have been left in without any recollection of the original point. There's a rotting sea creature (a giant squid perhaps) on the beach at one point that the characters walk around, prod and consider it's huge eye - the reason for this isn't ever explained and there is no point to it in character or plot development, it's just there. Why couldn't it have been cut out? The film would have been shorter and less pointless - I suppose they spend a lot of money making the creature so had to include it as some sort of justification.Keith Richards appearing as Jack's father has very little point to it, apart from just that - it's a self -indulgent reference to Depp using him as part of his character development. Clearly Keith manages to live, against all odds, but he can't act.Unless you're really keen on the Pirates, and I'm quite fond of them, I must say, I'd avoid this. The little Latin isn't enough to make it interesting, not really. There were one or two rather good jokes, but, tellingly, I can't remember them a few hours later. The multiple Depp instantiations, as Sparrow's hallucinations, are, again, simply self- indulgence, it diminishes the effect of Depp's character and makes it all feel as if it is just a vehicle for his acting - good acting, certainly, in context, but shallow and mannered when isolated like this, it makes him appear simply hammy, an unkindness, I think, to Depp's undoubted talent.Calypso, the goddess, apparently, was deeply unimpressive, as was the silly puzzle that looked interesting, but was trite in solution, to returning from Davey Jones Locker.In summary, to long, to thin and too lazy.",3,2,10,26 May 2007
