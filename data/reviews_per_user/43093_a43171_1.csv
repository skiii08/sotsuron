Requiem for a Dream," what a film
","this film was the best piece of film i have seen in many years!  the way that the whole thing is shot makes you feel everything that the stars do. one thing that especially shocked me was the fact that there is a wayans brother that can act!  the ending of it was exceptional too.  this is because it does what more films should do, make the viewer totally unhappy. whereas most film makers would have left the ending with everyone living happily ever after this leaves everyone with even more problems in their life than they had before which i tink was a classic twist.  i hope darren aronofski makes more like it and he can only get better!",Null,0,1,15 January 2002
