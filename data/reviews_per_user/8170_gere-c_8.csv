The King's Speech," F..., F..., F..., Fantastic!
","A film extremely well produced, sensitive and based on a true story, which around better. The King's Speech is a film full of beauty, either by its plot, characters, photography, setting, costumes, light and moving soundtrack, but mostly his performances, starring Colin Firth.Colin Firth did an amazing job to perfectly capture the feeling of being a stutterer, the difficulty that these people go to great trouble to express themselves through words, but not only that, he made the glossy paper of a King very convincing, showing all their limitations and the fear of dealing with such power - even so it became known as a person rather shy -, also showed the will to lead his people, the desire to boast his family, it all became clear and very well worked this beautiful performance, which, in my opinion, deservedly received the Oscar for best actor, beating DiCaprio in Inception.As i stated, the plot is based on real events, and is wonderful to see behind the scenes of the royal family, their problems, conflicts and customs, was immensely enriching follow the trajectory of a King who suffers from stuttering and still manages overcome its limitations thanks his desire to lead his people. And even with many twists and turns, accompanied and assisted by his faithful friend, Lionel.I honestly did not expect much of this film, even though it received the Oscar for best picture, but I admit that surprised me a lot and found it very good. Even being on a topic somewhat unknown, especially for me I'm Brazilian, I felt fantastic. Undoubtedly, worth watching!",9,1,1,28 November 2015
Catch Me If You Can," This movie is the second mouse
","Catch Me If You Can can be a smart movie, funny and at the same time light to watch. Its two hours and twenty go 'flying', he does not feel, so much that you can have fun and hold this film.He has a very good plot, with good performances - mainly DiCaprio and Christopher Walken -, DiCaprio because commanded sensationally the movie showing multiple identities, knowing to be a character with a lot of insight to act in many different ways and in many different situations. And Walken manages to come because he transpose his emotion in your life with a lot of problems. Tom Hanks had a good performance, but when I think of his performances in The Terminal or Forrest Gump, which were sensational, in Catch Me If You Can not seem so great, but also is very good.The direction was very good. I'm no fan of Spielberg in particular, but I recognize that he has great movies, so that i've watched a lot and I liked the most. This was no different a light direction, which does not force the bar to the viewer. Knowing how to be smart, know how to be subtle, knows how to be funny. Although I found some unnecessary scenes on the life of Frank Jr., which lengthened a little movie, but nothing that hinders the viewer, the film still holding you from start to finish, no doubt.Overall, this is it, it is nothing revolutionary in the cinema, but still, it's a great film by a great director, is very light to watch and you probably do not feel the time passing.",9,1,2,1 December 2015
Fight Club," Amazing direction, performance and plot, so, amazing movie
","Oh, that magic movie! It all starts by management more a great direction of David Fincher, which is sensational in direction and is better every day, even though not directed also very movies. The plot is impeccable, it makes you think, instigate, doubt, makes you think of a thousand ways than is everything in the film, but, still, it's incredibly surprising, holding you from beginning to end. I still remember the first time I saw him, the end is the extremely insightful, even though inspired by the book - which also i read - the film knows to be very well suited, and managed to pass all a sensational way.The acting is also a high point of the plot, Brad Pitt in one of his best performances, alongside Snatch. Norton has in Fight Club, for me, his best performance overcoming Red Dragon - I think very good. Besides other highlights, such as Helena Carter and other secondary actors.Now, one of the most amazing things is that you do not get tired of seeing it. Best of reviewing this movie is that with each new time you watch you discover new things, whether the 'flashes', in the almost imperceptible appearances or other things, showing that he knew to be done in detail.Fight Club is a film that has to be watched attentively, so you will surprise and delight more, no doubt. One of the best mind blowing movies ever made. Worth watching and reviewing whenever is possible!",10,0,2,29 November 2015
42," More than just a movie
","Even blacks being very important in World War II, many of them recruited as civilians to help the US military in war, to return home - those who returned - had to continue living with all the segregation and discrimination that persisted in the United States that the '40s. '42' tries and manages to show very well that, being a biographic, it shows the life of Jack Robinson in his early years as a player of Baseball, shows all its vigor to continue in their struggle to be the first black to join the MLB, suffering that means a lot of discrimination from other players and from mostly white audience.Directed by Brian Helgeland, who had previously been writer of very intelligent films, such as LA Confidential and Mystic River, the film has a fluid appearance in his dialogs, which are strong and well defined, especially in the presence of Harrison Ford, playing Branch Rickley, the main acceptor ingression of Jack in MLB.It also shows numerous events related to segregation and discrimination that colors people suffered, trying hard to sensitize the viewer - not that it takes some merit of the film, it does not take away, just try to mark it well - so many that happened directly with Jack, as to what happened with the other black, as the separation of places for whites and colors, seen in part that separated the audience that would watch the baseball games, something that was only abolished in 1964, with the Civil Rights Act. In addition to other events, such as not leaving the team staying at the hotel because of Jack being black; the insults suffered by Jack from Philadelphia coach, Ben Chapman; discrimination also suffered by his teammates and team of rivals, and later their acceptance; a boy to hear his relative and hundreds of fans scold Jack, swears it Jack too, giving, then, the beginning to a prejudice that can chase the kid for the rest of his life, among other strong events in the film.The movie, above all, still shows all Jack wins, as was a skilled player and he deserved get where he is. The film ends when the Dodgers advance to the World Series - that they would lose to the Yankees, the team that dominated the Baseball scene in those years -, counting also in the credits the way that some of the characters have taken in their lives.",8,1,1,29 November 2015
Horrible Bosses," Could be much better
","A weak movie, which does not add anything in his comedy, but enough to yield a enough money to another commercial film comedy.He is not even really bad, is in the middle ground between good and bad, in my opinion, this for several reasons. Starting with the plot, the idea seemed to have everything to be done a good movie, and the fact that Kevin Spacey be in the movie made me more enthusiastic, but this was not well spent. The plot is rather forced and no depth at all, where it takes considerably until you reach the apex of the film (when the triplet put their ideas into practice), which is not great, but it lasts very little also, as soon arriving at the end, in addition to various cut scenes being 'cut' in a bad way, including sexist forms, occasionally. Overall, it's a plot that could be well used, but it was not, not really.The acting is not great, actors like Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, that are actors already well known in several cinema films, were not put to good use, as well as fine secondary performances, they were very attached to their characters (where they had not much variation to be) and forced jokes. The rest, especially the actors that are most commonly in today's films, was also no big deal, just regular performances, did not see any highlighted, except for the actions of Charlie Day, who was the only one considered outside of the curve, but the Colin Farell was very disappointing, including the arrest of the character that had, in the same way as Kevin Spacey, for example.Basically this is a comedy that pays a good commercial profit but does not have anything new, anything really good or really worth investing your money or time on it. But if you want to risk...",5,1,2,4 December 2015
We're the Millers," They're the Millers
","The film is cool, I surprised my expectations. It's a good movie to watch, relax and laugh, but nothing fantastic either.Starting with the casting and acting, David Clark, in the role of Jason, made a strange performance, it is rather a good actor and did a good role in this movie, but him as a drug dealer/ drug smuggler not able to convince me, that teen hair early in the film and his acting 'rude' really did not seem to me to combine (although I imagine that chooses for the role he was because he could easily pass for a 'straight-laced family man'). Jennifer Aniston had a normal performance, despite their interesting strip scene. Emma Roberts seems to act always the same, but in this film like this came together in his role, that riot girl with parents (which could be better spent). Will Poulter, playing Kenny, was what more surprised me, I believe he can get more at the scene of current cinema, has potential. Among others, Ed helms had a very bad acting, and the father Fitzgerald (Nick Offerman) very surprising, it was cool.The plot is cool and well done. But I still think some scenes a little too forced, like that of Pablo escape with the trailer or the meeting between Jason and Brad ; others were cool and could be better exploited. Overall it was cool, especially considering it is a comedy film that should not be taken too seriously. Overall, this is it, the film is cool and fun. Most of the performances are good and the plot involves you in the majority. A nice movie to watch, but not expecting much.",7,0,1,6 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Is not bad at all, but is disappointing
","The Last Jedi certainly had a big hype on it and was certainly one of the big movies for this year. But i think he didn't fulfill what he promised.The film has good points, as a great action scenes (what we do expect in every movie of Star Wars). Also, for the first time, it was trying to show the world of Star Wars much more efficiently through the photography, which i found very good.But the movie is problematic in many ways. The main one and what annoyed me the most is the fact that film is a big beat around the bush. I even thought it would not be, mainly because the drama about Kylo Ren e Rey, but all this evolution of the character of Kylo Ren, who occupied too many minutes (even a little dragged) of the film is thrown away, which bothered me too much. Besides that, the others character and the story of the trilogy are practically do not change in anything that make deserve their two and a half hours. The only exception to what i considered a filler is Rey and the changes in Luke's character (but this changes don't happen in the movie, but we only had notion of this in the movie).In addition, the development is complex and confusing, even creating very unnecessary scenes for the plot top ut more action in the film and a possible heroic scene to please the public. The many jokes in the movie bother too, beeing very unnecessary in the most tThat one from Kylo Ren shirtless was ridiculous). Not that I do not think this fun at certain times to relax, but it seemed to me quite exaggerated in most, remembering even some Marvel movies, that also have this problem.As a conclusion, the film delights, even because i know some friends who liked it a lot (as well the opposite). I liked too, but not so much, appealing as action, good entertainmen and very well produced, but close to what I expect for Star Wars, especially in relation to the story of the movie, it was kind of disappointing.",5,0,0,17 December 2017
WALL·E," Cute for kids, highly critical for adults
","WALL-E knows to be many things, from a movie light, funny and cute - especially in the reactions of robots - up to a highly critical film our society today. And you have to learn to see all these aspects, but it is undeniable the absorption of all the criticism contained in it, which makes us reflect.A plot that seems simple, the story of a robot who lives working with the rubbish left on Earth - and therefore was abandoned - but to see who was left a new robot on Earth, EVA, begins a mix of feelings fear and love for her, showing all this in pure form. Such feelings were to be common in-humans, but now who can have feelings are robots, after all, humans no longer seem to know what it is.And the movie tries and can pass it. Maybe a robot does not have so many feelings in the future, but a human-being is quite capable of not having it, showing complete disregard for the environment and complete technological alienation, which is demonstrated repeatedly in the film, such as, for instance, the scenes of the 'discovery' of the pool at Axiom. And all this proves to be very worrisome for our future, for our entire fauna and flora.Despite the criticism contained high - which I liked very much - the movie still sins in some aspects of the plot, mainly to have a high repeatability scenes, both funny parts as parts in action. Staying at various times a certain sameness, but not on a sameness that makes you lose the desire to watch the movie - it does not. In addition to spatial failures, especially in impulse scenes of EVA and WALL-E with the extinguisher in space. But do not think this should be taken so seriously, after all is a very oriented film for children, but with a 'little critic'in its means.WALL-E must be watched and appreciated, as much for its beauty as for its criticism for ourselves. So, just watch.",9,0,1,29 November 2015
