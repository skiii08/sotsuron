Blade Runner 2049," A good sequel
","I always thought that Blade Runner deserved a high quality sequel in either movie or novel form. However, the book which was done some years after the movie was not very good. My first impressions of Blade Runner 2049 is that it is a good sequel to the original.",8,0,2,27 December 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," A clearly tacked on ending lowered the quality
","The main story before and in the bunker was quite good. I did expect some kind of connection to the original Cloverfield movie but not the rushed action sequence of the ending. It would have been better to have some kind of a reveal in the end where maybe something Cloverfield related is seen in the distance like when she looks up and sees living birds, she then sees something in the distance. But we instead get an ending action sequence which seems to have been hurrying tacked onto the the main story. It deflated the quality of the rest of the story. It also uses a technique in the last act with which I am quite bored. The final action scene is in the dark. Too many movies shoot CGI heavy scenes in the dark. I think that it is a cost saving thing. In the case with this movie, it transitions from day to might too quickly, almost like the rest of the movie was already filmed and the final act was tacked on but on a budget. It doesn't totally spoil the movie. It will depend on where the franchise goes since the end scene was basically a cliffhanger.",6,1,2,8 February 2018
Gravity," Better than a lot of the violent sci-fi
","I grant this there are a lot of inaccuracies. But I enjoy this movie anyway. Do I think that they could have done better with the physics and placement of things? Sure. But it is an attempt to do sci-fi without the need for villains and fighting. There are a lot of possibilities for sci-fi stories which deal with things other than warfare. This is an example of such a story, as flawed as it is. The sequencing of the events are done in a way which I find easy to forgive the missteps. It's also nice that the sounds outside of the music is mostly what the person would hear rather than the overused sounds in space which are usually heard. And I think that the soundtrack was quite good.",7,0,1,24 April 2018
Star Trek," Rubbish Star Trek and Rubbish Sci-Fi
","The existing timeline has a huge range of possible stories. Even a minor exposure to the Star Trek novels shows this. There was no need to radically change the timeline. But, if done, radical changes like this should be with a superior storyline. But I find the whole thing to be subpar. There are terrible character motivations and development. And the sci-fi elements are horrible. As bad as some of the physics in Star Trek have been, the reboots leaves sci-fi behind and uses something like a 7 year old mentality for inspiration.",1,6,12,31 October 2017
Captain Marvel," I enjoyed this
","I enjoyed this. It was not as boring as some people say. Like any superhero movie, there were plot issues. But I don't think that it was so much with the lead character. There were explanations why Carol Danvers was initially not as strong as she became. Bre Larson's performance was adequate. I actually liked the diversity in the movie. I also liked how the movie had the more alien beings be the good guys for a change.",7,3,9,29 March 2019
Passengers," Non-violent, psychological sci-fi
","My sci-fi preference is for hard science fiction. I like as much science accuracy as possible. In that vein, I also prefer psychological realism. I can't relate if the portrayal of what people do and say are too far out of sink with how they would really act. I have gotten more selective with what I watch because of these things. I dislike being disappointed after I watch a movie or read a book. For instance, I disliked Star Wars Force Awakens. I'm even a bit forgiving toward the prequels. But I think that Force Awakens stretched coherence too far. But that deserves its own post. I just watched Passengers (2016). I had reservations because multiple reviews illustrated how much of the science was wrong and about the abusive action of Pratt's character. But I liked the idea that it didn't have any intentional antagonists. So I rented it. Yes, it did get rather loose with the science. But I thought that it had a compelling story and interesting character portrayals. I thought that the positives outweighed the negatives. You see, another thing with which I've gotten bored is the antagonist / protagonist method of story telling. Some people claim that Pratt's character is the antagonist. But I think of the character as being someone who intends to be a good guy but makes a horrible mistake. The end result is that I felt that Passengers had enough for me to consider it to be enjoyable science fiction. It had a good concept, generally good story progression, likable characters and no enemies. That being said, it really could have done better by the science without being detrimental to the story. But I will watch it again.",8,2,3,31 October 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Time travel
","The biggest problem of this movie is time travel. In the End Game, time travel is both ex machina and the driving part of the plot. It was expected to have a time travel element but it took up so much of the movie that it weakened the overall impact of the Infinity set of movies.",2,51,95,25 April 2019
Arrival," Time travel ruins a potentially good story again
","I don't get how this is considered great science fiction. Honestly, time travel and related fantasy is way too overused in sci-fi. This is NOT hard sci-fi as some people claim. The time travel elements ruin what could have been a good first contact story. I would have been fine with the slower pace if the conclusion was better.",3,1,3,8 November 2017
Lucy," Total nonsense
",There was a thread of a story wasted by total nonsense and a ridiculous ending. The story of a woman forced into carrying a drug which leaks and turns her into a superhuman could have been interesting. But it was undercut with so much nonsense about the 10% brain usage and a nonsensical time travel ending that it was very hard to watch. I fast forwarded several times because the absurdities were too much. This took pseudoscience in cinema to an extreme. Even the sequences of her transformation were silly. It's like they had specific visuals which they wanted but had little thought where to put them. I read that the directory said that this movie was 10 years in development. But they could only come up with this?,1,3,10,30 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Go for Star Wars Legends instead
",I was initially hopeful for this movie when I read that it had a strong female lead. But the female character was about the only positive thing which stuck with me. Too much stuff from previous movies are repeated in lower quality ways. And too much was an excessive stretch of both Star Wars and sci-fi.,2,14,80,31 October 2017
Her," Multilayered science fiction
","I recently watched Her for the 3rd time. I really like this movie. It's the kind of movie which goes beyond just watching it. It generates thoughts and feelings which last awhile. It has a fabulous aftertaste, in a manner of speaking. I want to savor it for a time after each viewing. Even the seemingly off putting letter writing as a business thing acts as a kind of commentary. Overall, I found the script and acting almost musical. Speaking of music, I thought that they did a really good job with matching the soundtrack to the events in the movie.",10,12,17,31 December 2017
Contact," Low denominator sci-fi ultimately promotes religious belief
","I don't fault the acting. A good portion of the story prior to the launch is good, although I think that the movie badly dates itself by using the president and news people of the time. The actual contact with the alien dives into hocus-pocus fantasy. Then the idea that things are arranged to give the traveler almost no proof of the encounter seems ludicrous. The movie seems to go from challenging beliefs to using the alien contact as a metaphor for believing things without proof. It suggests a purpose for a lack of proof.",4,2,5,8 November 2017
The Island," It has the Michael Bay infection
","I found the premise interesting. And I enjoyed the acting. But I dislike Michael Bay's camera work. The action sequences are very unfocused due to too many cuts. Even non-action scenes have this problem. I still enjoyed it but it could have been far better if the camera work was done differently. For me, Michael Bay's style takes me out of the movie. Some of the dialog was also overly simplistic. I'm not talking about from the clones. But the 'normal people' had too much cliched dialog. And the explanation for having the clones awake could have been better.",6,1,2,28 October 2018
