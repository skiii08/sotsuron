The Devil's Advocate," Excellent movie with an unpredictable ending
","I'm not really a huge Keanu Reeves fan, but I really liked his acting in this movie, there's some good chemistry between him and Pacino, but I thought the script could have been a bit better. It's a hard movie to follow the first time through, but if you pay close attention you'll find it's really an excellent movie.",9,1,1,23 December 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Movie of All Time!
",This film is by far my favorite movie to date. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry. Once you watch this movie a second time you see how all the small details that you may have seen as insignificant fall into place. My personal favorite is how the rock hammer was in the starting pages of the book of Exodus from the bible.,10,0,0,23 December 1999
