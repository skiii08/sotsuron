Iron Man 3," Not trolling, just being honest
","Iron Man 3 is... screw it, you know what Iron Man 3 is, you know who Tony Stark is. Anyways, Iron Man 3 picks up after the events of Avengers: 'what happened in New York', as the movie refers to that movie. I know there's a lot of every-which-way hype over this movie already but hopefully I can navigate my way through that and just give my unaffected view.But let's get down to brass tax, Iron Man 3 is an Iron Man movie, for better or worse. For me, mostly for worse because that FIRST trailer, (and none of the ones after it) promised a much edgier tone, and a finally not on-top-of-the-world Stark, giving the series a vitally necessary change of pace. I'm not saying I wanted The Dark Knight or anything, just something with more gravitas and a little less fizz. And the film dismisses the notion almost immediately. Yes, Tony does have some post-traumatic stress/sleep-deprivation stuff going on here, but it's not treated with any measure of depth or significance. Like everything else in the film, (EVERYthing, the characters, the plot, the fight scenes), it's treated as a throwaway gag, and has one of the most laughable half-baked resolutions I have ever seen for any plot arc. And lets face it, the mile-a-minute barrage of repartee-esque dialogue, and the infamous glib Stark one-liners which were so fresh and fun back when Iron Man came out... are all really tired and stale now; and that's pretty much the first half-hour of this movie.Once the film kicks into summer movie gear, it becomes an insipidly endless barrage of self-referential humor, broad slapstick, and lots (and LOTS) of noisy, flashy set pieces. And I'm not some action-hater or anything. I loved The Avengers. I just found the throw-downs in this overly bombastic, not particularly interesting, and pervasively noisy. That's not to say there weren't moments then and again that I thought were cool or found somewhat amusing, they were just drowned out by the rest.Iron Man 3 feels and plays much more like G.I Joe than any marvel movie. That especially goes for the ludicrous plot that stole it's villain origin story from an animated kidpic from ten years ago, it's baddies from (yes) G.I. Joe, and The Terminator, (sooooo Terminator, oh my gosh!!) and every cliché' from every buddy action flick ever. I feel like somebody's gonna be like 'NO! that's cuz it was a throwback, look at who directed it jerk!'. But when your plot is derivative AND ridiculous... yeah, that's all.Some people will definitely enjoy IM 3 just fine. It's certainly one of the most ambitious superhero films thus far in terms of the amount and scale of action. But I would say, even Thor was much better as a movie because of its solid script and well-drawn characters. (Avengers miraculously managed to have both).Iron Man 3 is a mediocre film, which I happened to see coming off another mediocre film...so there's that. But my overall opinion stands that it's garish excess, endless self-referential commentary, and disregard of potentially interesting plot elements, (not to mention some completely squandered characters) renders it an underwhelming film-going experience. It might just be me, but I find 'good' films to be entertaining. But oh well... it's gonna make sh**-loads. Oh I forgot to mention: my favorite part of the movie... Jon Favreau!! Did anyone else notice his unmistakably Vincent Vega getup in the first scene?? **/*****",Null,1,3,15 May 2013
Se7en," Haunting and visually poetic
","I'm a little late to the party with Se7en, as I first watched it just this year. One of those things where it's been in the queue forever and I'm slowly working my way through. Anyhow as a result of my procrastination, my 'experience' of the film was slightly desecrated, but my appreciation was not. I realized just before I reached the massive twist of the film that I saw what was coming. I don't even remember who spoiled it for me...but oh well.The only reason I address this is the final scene of the film is by far the most talked-about aspect of the film...by FAR. And I didn't think it was greatest final act shake-up I've seen, but the movie itself is incredible. My favorite part of Se7en is it's stylishness. David Fincher delivers a beautifully noir aesthetic to the piece that colors the entire story. And my other favorite thing about Seven is the surreality of the nameless, ever-raining, Gotham-like, hellhole city where our mystery unfolds. I cannot overstate how much I love that story-telling choice. It gives the film an immeasurable sense of dread and intrigue. Aesthetically, simply a masterpiece. Se7en's other major strength it its leads. The script doesn't over-talk anything; it's economical and concise, but provides just enough chemistry for it's protagonists to make this 'buddy cop' film stand out. Pitt and Freeman turn in some of their most thoughtful work and play excellently off one another. It's a character piece that succeeds without dwelling too long on exposition or any forced 'bonding'. Their relationship develops naturally, and in the face of abject psychological chaos, calm moments are brief and rare. I suppose it would be unfair to not mention Seven's creatively macabre components as well. I realize I didn't include a synopsis, but if you haven't already heard it 100 times from cinephiles and review sites, I'm sure it's somewhere on this page. The killer in Seven patterns takes inspiration for his murderous work of art from the seven deadly sins, and dispatches his victims in accordance with said sins. But the bizarre and disturbing, (albeit not explicit) murders are still a means to an end. The film's really about the tone, characters, and noir feel. 8.1/10",Null,2,4,4 July 2013
Fast & Furious 6," 'Slow & Laborious'
","Expectations were high after the inexplicably positive reaction to Fast Five. That film, was completely over the top and thoroughly cool. It seemed as though the Fast franchise was on the precipice of becoming the perfect example of straight-up popcorn cinema; unabashed, silly, and awesome. The ads for Furious 6 gave the impression we were gonna be taken to yet another level this time, (did they frickin' crash a plane with a harpoon!!?) Things were about to get even more insaner-er, i mean we talking' VE-hicular warfare. What's left to say?Unfortunately, Fast 6 is not even awesome for what it is. Yes we get a couple pretty sweet moments here and again; the highway-tank battle being the prime example. But who would've thought the sludge weighing a movie like this down would be too...much....talking. I'm serious, there's about 35 minutes of setup which covers precisely the same material the trailer compressed into about 25 seconds. This is not good for a movie like this. But this wouldn't even be much of a problem if all those interaction/'character development' scenes were remotely interesting...or good. They are not. The first half is snore inducing, and the characters are not only unlikable, but shallow...no, I mean like even for this kind of film. A good example of this is the movie introduces another hotshot, car-driving crew, and one of the characters has to outright spell out how they are the evil dopplegangers of our favorite nice, team of criminals. The other crew of characters, even for the one-dimensional stereotypes they are, are somehow flat. There's literally not one memorable thing about any one of them.Another issue the movie struggles with is focus. We've got Toretto with his whole 'get Letty back' plot line, we've got the Rock doing his thing, and then there's this whole subplot with Paul Walker's cop past coming back for him in prison as he's ambushed by some dudes he put away, all of which could've been an entirely separate movie. The film jumps and cuts back and forth between so many different ideas, it loses all sense of direction. And the one- liners...OMG! Suffice to say, the one-liners on the trailer are the absolute best the film has. As I said, there's a couple amusing set-piece moments, but hardly enough to offset the dullness and trudgy pace.Undemanding viewers may derive some pleasure out of Fast and Furious 6 on a completely brainless, intentionally dumb and juvenile level. But Fast Five showed us we can do better.6.0/10",Null,1,3,4 July 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Still not quite amazing, but an improvement
","The sequel to the unnecessarily retold story made only so Sony could maintain the rights to yada yada yada, you already know. When I first saw ASM2, I pretty much hated it. I thought it was slow, overstuffed, and mediocre. That being said, there are some aspects of the movie that are good, that I enjoyed, and make it worthwhile.One significant improvement is that Peter/Spider-Man's character is much more likable this time. That's not to say Garfield hasn't always been good in the role, it's more to do with the writing in the first movie. In this film, they really capture the humor and wisecrackiness of Spidey, (whereas in the Amazing Spider-Man it was much more sarcastic and mean-spirited). On the other hand this film, like many comic book flicks, doesn't entirely succeed in creating fully-fleshed out, convincingly motivated villains. It does to some extent with Electro, but his transformation from pretty nice, if weird and nerdy, guy to evil mass murderer is pretty abrupt. However, that isn't all that unusual for the Spider-Man films, as the series' villains' psychology and origins have all been fairly cheesy, (aside from Norman Osbourne in the first Raimi movie). There were some moments in the film I thoroughly enjoyed; particularly an opening chase scene with Peter foiling a heist and immediately rushing to his graduation, arriving just in time and changing into his gown while forgetting to remove the mask. There are a lot of entertaining and funny moments, particularly in the first half of the film. Somewhere in the middle though, it gets even more melodramatically forced than Spider-man 3. After that point the film really drags for about an hour until it kicks back in for the climax. The film has a serious focus issue, as there are pretty much 3, (maybe 4) story lines. Peter's arc of learning the truth about what happened to his father, Electro's arc, Harry's plot line, and the Peter/Gwen relationship. Harry's story isn't really connected to the others at all, and could've been a whole other movie. So the Amazing Spider-man 2 is a mixed bag, with some real strengths. The action scenes are well-executed, and the humor is good and very characteristic of Spider-man. As for performances, Fox is fine, Garfield and Stone are still good and share fantastic chemistry, and Dane Dehaan is great as Harry Osbourne. On the other hand, the movie is plodding, unfocused and occasionally pretty dumb. Is it better than the unnecessary retold origin film? Yes. But director Mark Webb and co. still have a ways to go toward refining this series. 6.0/10",4,1,5,9 August 2014
The Departed," Very good mob film
","The crime epic to end all crime epics- The Departed. The Departed marks Scorsese's return to gangster cinema, 15 years after his genre-defining Goodfellas. This time however, the scene is moved to Boston, the focus on the Irish mob. Two young cadets graduating from the academy; one a devoted law enforcement officer joining the state police undercover unit. The other, a mole from the mob who answers directly to Irish underworld kingpin Frank Costello, his mentor and father figure. It isn't long before both organizations start to suspect a rat in their midst. The real tension and excitement of the film stems from the two men's circular game of cat and mouse, as they each try to smoke the other out while simultaneously attempting to remain anonymous to their colleagues and each other. It gives a the film an ever-present, immediate sense of dread, particularly for Dicaprio's character which I see as kind of the answer to the typical undercover cop character; it's not some glamorous, slick job, it's stressful as hell! The film gives a more realistic view on what kind of toll that would take on a person, with life on death on the line every minute of every day and no time to cope with it. None of that to say the film is 'arty', which it ain't! It's a bloody, coarse, lurid mess of a picture... in the most complimentary sense. While the film has more atmospheric tension, and is more plot driven than some of Scorsese's earlier work, there's still buckets of gore, plenty of shock value and some amusing soundtrack choices for some of the more grisly moments. Still, I wouldn't say I liked everything about The Departed, and wouldn't consider it in masterpiece territory. Some aspects of the film, and some of the characters I found less believable than others. And I thought Nicholson's character began verging on cartoonish towards the end. However, the film is an excellent showcase for Leonardo Dicaprio, who is electrifying in his frenzied, panicked state, as well as in his dialogues with Costello. While the film is clearly very much an ensemble piece, I would call him the standout.The Departed is a very good mob film. There're elements of it that have been done before, but the film's particular brand of rawness and high-octane tension elevate it above just another study/comparison of cops/criminals. Because after allÂ…when you're facing a loaded gun",Null,1,1,4 May 2013
The Wolverine," Almost Great! (very very very minor spoiler, not even a really a spoiler)
","The Wolverine is Hugh Jackman's second outing, (if you count that first abysmal piece of trash) as the character, and let me just say right off, I loved this movie!.mostly. The Wolverine is an awesome, character-driven, badass comic book film..or at least two thirds of one. One of the coolest things about The Wolverine is it very closely follows the story-line of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's definitive miniseries about the character. The film picks up sometime not too long after The Last Stand and we first see our hero bumming around through the mountains in his grief over Jean Grey's death at his clawed-hands. Logan is in somewhat of a slump and at a crossroads when he meets a woman named Yukio while he's in the middle of beating up some hunters in a bar. She gives him an invitation to come to Japan at the request of an old, dying industrialist who's life Logan saved in WWII. With not much else going on, Logan accepts and meets with the man, Yoshida, who offers Logan the chance to become mortal by transferring his healing powers to him. Logan declines and shortly after, Yoshida dies. Chaos ensues from there when the funeral is attacked by Yakuza assassins and Logan discovers his regenerative powers have ceased healing his wounds. Logan makes it his mission to protect Yoshida's granddaughter, the beautiful Mariko and flees with her to get her somewhere safe.There are so many strong aspects of the movie. For one, there's a solid director this time around in James Mangold, who gives the film both style and subtlety that marks an immediate quantum leap in quality from the last Wolverine movie. The storyline is also compelling as it's a personal story that focuses on Logan's inner struggle, his never-ending journey and his relationship with Mariko. It doesn't shove a bunch of one-dimensional, under-developed mutants in the movie just for fan-service, (insultingly cynical fan-service at that). The movie has focus, it has humor, character, and some pretty kick-ass action. One particular sequence that has to be mentioned as a stand-out is the fight on top of a moving bullet-train; one of the best-executed and most thrilling action sequences I've ever seen. The movie deftly balances and alternates between character moments and action and gives you a story you can actually care about. The problem with the movie: ..the last third goes downhill in very pronounced, overt kind of way. You can just feel that it starts to lose steam and they drag it out simply because every comic book movie has to have a dragged-out, over-the-top finale. And that's what it has. The movie has a really cheesy, underwhelming climax, and 'The Viper' is a lame, borderline annoying villain. It's so unfortunate that's the case, because otherwise this is an awesome movie. I liked all the characters and their portrayals, (aside from Viper), from Mariko to the evil Shingen, to Logan's 'Bodyguard' Yukio. I did like the actual ending, (before the credits) of Logan on the plane, (still afraid of flying!) with Yukio, and them going wherever he goes next together, but with the events of DOFP, it doesn't' seem like any continuation of that is possible. Overall, The Wolverine does right by the character and the storyline it's based on, which is a real rarity. I can see why there are divided views on the movie, it has a lot of good, as well as some great and some lame. I think though, the more you care about the character, the more you'll enjoy it. 7.7/10",7,1,2,29 June 2014
