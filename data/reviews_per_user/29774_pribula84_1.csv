3:10 to Yuma," one of the greatest films of the decade.
","Finally two of the best actors of today join together in one hell of a great movie. Both Bale and crowe Still have not let me down. When you here of a movie with one of these two actors being in them its bound to be good. Now there both together in one movie and it turns out to be one of the best movies of the decade. This film has great realistic action,great acting by everyone,great writing. It's got it all. I recommend everyone to see it. Even if you're not a western fan,It really has a great interesting story behind it. Bale and crowe's characters are just great. You learn more about them through out the movie,about who they are and why they are like they are. The climax is just amazing. I won't go any further. Just trust me and go see this spectacular film and you will get your moneys worth.",10,3,9,9 September 2007
