The Avengers," Crap
","Okay first of all I am not your snooty critic who likes silent movies, artsy stuff. I love the action movies, super hero comics. I loved captain America movie, iron man was good too. However this movie was mindless crap. There were no plot variations, dialog's were comical at best. It was just pointless CGI effects. The villain had absolutely no depth and frankly was brainless. At least change the script a bit, put in some variations in the script and hire actors who have depth in acting. Captain America at least had a decent story line, you could connect with the character, the same with iron man and the same with the spider man series. This one from the start was just mindless violence, aliens blowing up crap. All super hero movies should have a good story line, a villain who can many shades to their character. That's why Dark Knight was so good not only because the script had some meaning(terrorism, seeing the good versus bad in people) and of course Heath ledger amazing rendition of the Joker. I realize this isn't a movie that will win an Oscar and also it's meant to park your brain at home and just enjoy but at least put in some effort instead of just letting computer animation take over. Hollywood is getting lazier by the minute.",1,35,118,5 May 2012
