50 First Dates," The most romantic movie I have seen in a long time.
","I cannot believe that an Adam Sandler movie moved me but this one completely did. So many people are afraid of the disabled, but that Adam could care for someone who forgot him everyday is something that shows how wonderful real love can be. How could he not make the effort, Drew's character was one of the few people who will never lose a sense of innocence and wonder so often dulled with time. Sure critics attacked this movie saving their praise for the oblique `Punch Drunk Love' but this movie spoke to me in a way that few have. I mean I usually giggle at tragic or dramatic love stories, but this felt very real. Sure there is some gross out humor (which except for the vomit fit in ok) but it is needed to humanize the characters. No this is not the very best movie ever made and some of the comedy misses but I know of no sweeter love story. I doubt if Drew or Adam will ever read this, but I want thank them for giving me such a meaningful moment.",Null,0,0,8 May 2004
