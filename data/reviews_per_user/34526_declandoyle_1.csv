First Man," ho hum here we go to the moon
","I got up at 3 or 4 am to see the original landing. my uncle & i sat transfixed while the rest of the house slept on. little did we know that the rest of the astronauts & NASA members were just as dis-interested, IF you believe this movie. they were, it seems, capable of writing a headline on july20 of '2 civil servants land safely on moon. nobody killed'ryan gosling is an excellent actor but it would cost me blood to be able to differentiate between his character in blade runner.2049 & first man. are they related?disappointing movie, very little of the grandeur of space flight or the achievement.",5,1,2,22 November 2018
