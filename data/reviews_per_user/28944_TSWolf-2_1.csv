The Blair Witch Project," One of the most frightening films I've ever seen...
","Like an episode of 'The Real World' gone horribly, horribly wrong, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT draws you from a world of bickering slacker film students and into a wilderness that is like a raw, exposed nerve of the American heartland.  As things spiral out of control, if you choose to go with these characters, their panic and fear will infect you as in no other film. Without incidental music, without gory special effects, and without in-your-face shocks, this PROJECT yields unexpectedly harrowing results. If you choose to go into the woods again after seeing this film, it's more than the Big Bad Wolf that you'll fear waiting for you.",10,1,2,22 June 1999
