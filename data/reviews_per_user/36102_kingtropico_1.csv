The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," You must be watching a different movie
","For those giving this movie lower than a 7, you may be reviewing the wrong movie. I am a die hard fan and your point of unwanted changes from the book is completely invalid. It was almost perfect to the book aside from changes which enhanced the movie even more. The cast delivered a stunning performance and the movie is only boring if you are one of those who are bored if someone doesn't die in every single scene. Sorry to disappoint you but unlike those movies this one has a plot, and is setting up a sequel. It encompasses love, action, drama while being a sci-fi movie. If you feel the movie is unrealistic then how do you find movies such a star wars or other greats like avatar to be realistic? A deserved 10/10",10,7,19,8 March 2015
