Requiem for a Dream," Refreshing
","Every now and then a moviegoer needs to be throttled and jolted into the realm of 'something different', where old preconceptions of what makes a piece of cinema great are shaken and new ideas form. For me, Requiem was just such a movie.  This is not a happy, heroic, inspiring movie.  It's gritty, nauseating, and visceral. And that's what it should be. This movie, to me, is about void.  Complete apathy mixed with despair, and occasionally glimpsed moments of hope. On a less pedantic note, I simply think the cinematography, direction, editing, and most of all the performances in Requiem are just great.  Here, in particular, we see Marlon Wayans escape the confines of just being a 'funnyman', we see Jennifer Connelly prove without question that she's a strong talent (just now being really recognized by the industry, prior to this she had some real token-female roles), we see Jared Leto prove he's not a pretty-boy...and then there's Ellen Burstyn, a remarkable actor inexplicably kept from Academy Award glory (for what it's worth). This is probably my favorite movie. I have voted another movie or two higher (I voted this movie at an 8), but that is because with those I could repeatedly view them...Requiem gets to me, under my skin, enough that I can only watch it every now and then. Enjoy!",8,0,1,17 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Everything it needs to be.
","Taken on it's own merits, meaning not to be harshly compared with the book it's based on, this series has to be one of the ten best things in cinema history.There are story elements in the book that are missing in the series, as everyone knows, and Return of the King is no exception -- particularly, in my mind, the final scenes.. For the amount of time that Peter Jackson felt he had to tell this ending of the film trilogy, however, I feel it's everything it needs to be.The important thing is that the heart of the story is intact, complete, I think, with all the meaning and emotion that could be transferred to celluloid.I've read a complaint or two about the ending being too long. To these remarks I can only express bafflement. It's a discouraging sign of the 'mtv generation', so to speak, that once massive conflict has been resolved that the credits must then roll. This is something like a 10.5 / 11 hour event all told. 20 extra minutes of denouement is not only acceptable, it's demanded. Do not blame the film for your attention problems, for the fault is with your own stunted sense of interest.In my mind, I would have liked even greater time spent in finishing the story...More literal-minded fans of the book itself will probably agree..not to spoil the story for those unfamiliar.The battle sequences are, in a word, incredible. The performances are uniformly strong. The story itself is full of heart and the truth of what it means to be a man (and woman), the lengths we go to for fellowship, and the strength we can summon in our darkest hour.My particular favorite moment in the film, as of the moment of writing this rather glowing review, is Eowyn's dealings with the Witch-King.  But I was predestined to enjoy it, as I found it a great moment in the book as well.
Jackson and his team spared no expense in their labors. The cinema-appreciating public should do the same to support their finished product.",Null,0,0,17 December 2003
