The Avengers," Big Long Generic CGI Film
","The only reason why this film deserved even 3 stars is because of Robert Downey Jr. His character is the only one that really seems like he knows what he is doing and does it well. Everyone else could be anybody. Its just a generic badly designed action movie. The ending sequence and other action sequences seemed to drag and they made you look forward to the ending. Besides the Iron Man parts of the movie, the best part had to be the beginning trailers for better movies like THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. I have to say that they should of just made another Iron Man film which would have been more fun and not a long boring CGI movie. IF you must watch go to see the trailers and Robert Downey Jr",3,9,32,4 May 2012
