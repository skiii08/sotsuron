It," A good film that could've been great but is still loads of fun.
","This is a good film but not great by any means. Perhaps, to some extent it is the film buff in me or the Stephen King fan as well, even though I am not a die hard King fan, but I truly love and appreciate It more than most novels. Another could be the fact I am not a teenager and am 40. I grew up afraid of clowns because of the circus, Ronald McDonald and mimes and was ridiculed and teased for it for years. This also was when the very real urban legend of pedophiles dressed up as clowns were driving vans and cars around New England trying to lure kids into their vehicles many years before 'It' was even around. Creepy stuff but very real. The original mini-series horrified me with the chameleon Tim Curry. Let's face it the only reason anyone remembers that film was Curry (even though the kids were great). In many ways, Curry spoiled us with showing why and how clowns are, or can be scary without needing crazy effects. This brings us to the remake. Personally, for a guy that clowns can scare still (think Bozo, Gacy, old school mimes, Curry) Skarsgard's Pennywise had none of that, but he sure brought the laughs. I really did enjoy when he was actually in the film but the overhaul of CGI took away from his performance. Over the top? Oh yes, but great fun regardless.I really enjoyed this film because it is a lot of fun. The kids to me were the film as much as the atmosphere was, but the character changes show how underdeveloped many of the characters were written such as Henry Bowers, Belch, Victor Criss, Patrick Hockstetter, and poor Mike Hanlon has nothing to do, which to any It fan raises red flags. Despite this character shift, the film still works. I see the film as some have called it as a darker version of Stand By Me but without any amazing acting or writing. Everyone in the film however, was good, but having no real character development before we rush you to the next big jump, or scare really left a bad taste in my mouth. Muschietti has some real talent (remember Mama?) in how the camera tells the story and he sure as hell loves the big scares but goes for them way too often which at times at least in my opinion takes away from its effectiveness as in overkill. One thing you can take away from it is, these kids can act and its a lot of fun viewing despite the horrible CGI shoved down your throat, the character rushing, and big changes that leave you scratching your head. Of course, many will likely have no idea what I am talking about, but others you know who you are.Personally, Skarsgard was likable, over the top of course but scary? Nah. I thought he did good with what he had but I found myself thinking who would be afraid of this clown? I wasn't, but perhaps that is the adult in me talking, although Curry sure as hell makes me flinch still to this day by mere looks and mannerisms alone. Here, Skarsgard's take on Pennywise does not seem developed if that even makes sense, and comes off trying too hard in longer scenes. At times early on he sounded like Yoda, then later on goofy noises and a voice resembling Heath Ledger's brilliant Joker, which on a side note I have found in several characters of late, so perhaps I am projecting. I found it amusing but not scary.In the end, It is a fun film that has a lot of good points but also is lacking in several others. If you are a King nut there are a couple of plot points that will no doubt make you rather angry, I get it I saw it too, but the film is still enjoyable despite them. Grab your popcorn, milk duds, sour patches, soft drinks, and enjoy the fun film that IT truly is.",7,1,8,7 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," One Word: Underwhelming.
","A rather formulaic, dull epic that is a regular paint by numbers film as we have been here before countless times. Still, a couple of great cameos dating to previous Star Wars films are memorable and enjoyable. The only likable or interesting characters here are Director Orson Krennick played by the always effective Ben Mendelsohn, Galen Erso played by 'Hannibal' star Mads Mikkelsen & a very sarcastic, dry imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk of 'Firefly' fame. Personally I would have liked less dull action battles and some better written, more fleshed out characters, but at least we have Krennick even though he sadly is not given much to do. If you have seen the previous 7 films you will most likely be disappointed unless of a younger age, or know what will happen well before it happens. Sometimes it can be fun, but here it is often tedious and annoying. However, take what little enjoyable parts you can and enjoy the last minute, which is great. Could've been a lot better but is decent considering the fact there is not a ton to the plot, so make do with what you have.",6,23,45,17 December 2016
Suicide Squad," A Complete Mess Unfortunately (Contains Spoilers)
","As a person who leans towards DC over Marvel I was extremely disappointed with what I just witnessed a couple of hours ago. A complete mess which ruins the spirit of the comics in my view. Will Smith is the lead. The latter says it all right there. Not good. Now I can see why Tom Hardy dropped out (few of us buy the scheduling conflicts excuse after Smiths role grew). So what we have here is a squad of supposed super villains who are anything but. B and C list actors playing villains nobody would really care about outside of Quinn and Joker who is not even in the squad (sorry guys). A couple supposedly bad ass sociopaths are crying in the film and are all about helping each other and smiling. Are you serious? That felt more Marvel there. Still, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is the only real redeemable thing about the film in my view. Leto's joker is not as terrible as one is lead to believe, but not very good either with what he's given to do. Take off the grills and ridiculous tattoos and a voice that doesn't seem to imitate Ledger at times and you have a pretty decent Joker. I went in thinking Quinn would steal the movie and to some she might. I found her annoying and over the top which on one hand makes sense, but also her ever changing accents (extremely painful to hear I might add) and mad skills fighting wise does not add up. The critical reviews are legit. I went in with no true opinion and left wanting my money back. If you are not in the 10-14 year old range I can't imagine you liking this, but then again I've seen weirder things.",4,1,2,5 August 2016
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not Your Typical Tarantino but It Still Packs The Punches
","Having heard some reviews and seen some that thankfully did not give anything away I essentially went in blind despite hearing the ending was ridiculous. Well, the ending if you watch the film straight through is a doozy and fits the story completely. Many will go in assuming Tarantino dialogue, a killer soundtrack and tons of violence. That last bit is still present but not in huge doses as we all know from Quentin's past is everywhere whether good or not.The film's core is about the past of actor Rick Dalton (DiCaprio) and his best friend and former stunt double (Brad Pitt) and the present. Rick feels he is washed up as an actor and seems to be stuck in villain mode when he lands an acting gig. Many humorous scenes involve an emotional Dalton angry at himself for blowing lines or thinking his acting sucks, whereas his pal Cliff runs errands, feeds his dog and drives around meeting all types.Everyone in the film is perfectly cast especially DiCaprio, Pitt & Robbie. Outside of Fight Club, Brad Pitt has never been better and Leo shows he has a humorous side which I never knew existed to this extent. Robbie breathes life into an actress who was sadly mainly known as a murder victim to most of the world. The few scenes she is in as it is not her story are very sweet, touching, and interesting. Pitt steals every scene he is in and I found myself loving every time he was on screen. When together with Leo the chemistry is off the charts.I know many Tarantino die hards may likely or let's face it will be disappointed save for the last 20 minutes as they will assume it is going to be more of the same. Thankfully it is not. Outside of a few intense scenes this is something Tarantino has been building towards his entire career and although it is long and a slow burn it truly pays off.",9,17,38,28 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Enjoyable Film, A bit long but Hamill nailed it.
","In the ever intense world of Star Wars junkies and mere film fans the new Star Wars films sans Lucas are a lightning rod of negativity and second guessing. I liked Force Awakens, but Last Jedi easily blew that out of the water. Is it an amazing film? No, and it did not need to be but it is well written, acted (well outside of Rey and a newbie character) and actually has a designed plot. Were there twists? Yes. Were some predictable? Yes. The answer is did they pull them off? For me, they did, for others, evidently not. The main problem with the film is the middle of the film seems to drag a bit, although it does because it sets up the final act. I loved Luke's necessary presence in the film, the unexpected humor and the script as a whole. Hamill who overall always seemed the weakest actor in the past (despite still being effective) truly here nailed it in my opinion, and where the film may have lacked at times, his presence lifted it high above when they needed that heavy lifting. The latter surprised me to be honest but I thought despite some plot points and pacing that were a bit much, thrown in with a new over the top, annoying character the film was easily the best since Return of the Jedi. Of course, the trolls and die hards will vehemently no doubt disagree, but that is their right. A fun film that to me was well written and plotted out with a great performance by Mark Hamill.",8,15,34,16 December 2017
Joker," Masterpiece that proves film isn't dead
","In a world where mindless super hero films, reboots, and bad remakes dominate Hollywood, it leaves a lot to be desired. When you actually find all great let alone a good film at times it's like wining a few hundred bucks. Joker for me shows there is hope.Now, anyone that went into this film not knowing it was a dark, character study clearly didn't watch the trailers or read up on it, or they would know it's a backstory film that's going to be an obvious slow burn before the inevitable. Clearly, people just assumed it's called Joker so it's all Joker. Nope not by a long shot. Next time watch the trailers and read.The story revolves around Arthur Fleck who is a wannabe comedian and semi-professional clown. Arthur does not have much luck in life let alone much to look forward to. On a side note, he's also mentally ill but many of us are so we move along the best we can.Unfortunately for Arthur, he has a lot of bad luck in life to which he starts to crumble a bit. Later on he feels a couple of daggers that change and affect him tremendously, which results in a downward spiral resulting in The Joker or in reality Joker.The film is very dark and set around 1981 before one of its biggest influences Martin Scorsese's King of Comedy came out. It's also heavily influenced by Scorsese's Taxi Driver with shades of Clockwork Orange and even Network. It pays off.Joaquin Phoenix further proves or just put the nail in the coffin for anyone that he is the best actor currently working today in delivering an electrifying performance much worthy of an Oscar.Phillips shows he is a real filmmaker with this film and also shows he's a student of 70s cinema when anything was possible. Easily one of the best of the year, if not the best.",9,1,1,8 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Disappointing, way too long, but still fun.
","Having waited two years for this to come out I am left with a scurry of emotions. While not as good as the first part, in some ways it is better as Pennywise is actually a little bit creepy here compared to his silly demeanor in the first one. However, he reminded me off Freddy Krueger in the last 4 or 5 Freddy sequels where he would say a silly line or two, get a scare then vanish. Skarsgard's Pennywise was always abnormal and silly, but great fun at that. While he is still No Curry (as actually being scary is important) he is not the problem. The problems and there are many is the pacing, writing, character development or lack thereof, and some of the performances.It starts off with the infamous murder of gay adult Adrian Mellon which thankfully they included as it is one of the most important in the book as well as one of the creepiest. Sadly, here it is rushed and is only done in around five minutes or so. Not good. Xavier Dolan is an excellent actor and Mellon is a very important part of the story relating to Derry in present day so rushing it was a huge mistake. Still. at least it is here even if they stupidly rushed it and did not do much with it as they should have. People who have read the book know what I am talking about.For a film that is 11 minutes shy of three hours we could have used more character development instead of cheap scares and constant flashbacks back and forth every few minutes. Yes, this happens in the book and it works but in the film not so much. The problem is the grown up losers do not have much to them outside of annoying Richie and uptight Eddie who are spot on. Plus, if people who pay attention at movies, there is a big reveal involving why Richie acts the way he does which is new and it works perfectly. I was not expecting that and it worked even with Hader as Richie.I enjoyed the film although it is nothing amazing by any standards. Chastain's Beverly and McAvoy's Bill, two very important characters offered nothing here as adults. They finally gave Mike something to do as he is integral to the story and the actors who plays Ben & doomed Stan are fine, but nothing you really care about as that belongs to Richie and Eddie.Essentially, missed opportunities here and a film the drags for long periods of time when it shouldn't. One would think with how painfully long it is at times and feels even longer at others times, that there would be more insight and character development but nada with the majority of the characters. Skarsgard was funny and effective as always drooling and giggling when on screen and Bill Hader's Ritchie has perfectly timed observations and one liners that pick up scenes where we are bored to tears.A good film but a disappointing one as it did not need to be this long at all despite the huge size of the epic novel. The ending of Pennywise/It, (let's face it they showed him more as a clown as anything and that is another mistake) was interesting in the way it was handled, but we were left with 20 minutes after the fact of over the top cheesiness by the losers. Some will hate this, some may actually love it, and I'd imagine many may be in my spot acknowledging a mixed bag that often dragged, felt empty and just felt off as a whole.",5,1,3,7 September 2019
