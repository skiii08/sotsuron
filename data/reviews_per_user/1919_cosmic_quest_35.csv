Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Strictly for the kiddies
","It's ironic that one of the most anticipated films of the twentieth century will be remembered as being one of the biggest let-downs ever in the history of cinema. While fans eagerly rubbed their hands together in the hopes of an thrilling epic to follow the original trilogy, 'Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace' was instead a lesson in Hollywood greed and a man, namely George Lucas, losing sight of what 'Star Wars' was all about. It was no surprise SW were left bitterly disappointed by the dirge 'The Phantom Menace' revealed itself to be, a mix of dull dialogue and scenes clearly intended to sell toys to children in the audience.'The Phantom Menace' charts the early years of Anakin Skywalker, the boy who would grow to be Darth Vader and purge the galaxy of the Jedi. We see how nine-year-old Anakin entered the life of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and how he eventually came to be Kenobi's Apprentice as well as his first meeting with Padme, the future mother of Luke and Leia.Character-wise, Obi-Wan and his Master Qui-Gon are the only ones of really of worth. Ewan MacGregor, as Obi-Wan, and Liam Neeson, as Qui-Gon, depict a Master and Apprentice pairing that is complex mix of familial love and Qui-Gon continually snubbing the young man who adored him as a surrogate father in favour of this new child in his life. Other than that, we have a bland, boring female lead in Natalie Portman's Padme and then there is Anakin himself and the detestable Jar-Jar Binks.Anakin, aged nine, would have been a far more effective character had we seen him for being the slave he was instead of this happy-go-lucky all-American moppet. As a teenager, being a slave still deeply affected him but there is no sense of that in this film. Anakin should have been shown to be jaded and pained by what he was and been played by someone who is more solemn, such as Haley Joel Osment (who did audition for the role). Jake Lloyd just wasn't suited because he was too used to playing family/comedy roles and was too buoyant to properly show the depressing situation Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon found Anakin in. Sadly, people are too quick to blame little Lloyd for the problems with this film when it was George Lucas fully to blame for choosing the cute child over the talented one, and for writing such terrible dialogue for this character.As for Jar-Jar, the less said about him the better. This was a CGI-character who talked incomprehensible drivel and clearly added to amuse kiddiewinkles with his 'hilarious' slap-stick antics. I don't know about children but anyone over ten are just left cringing whenever he is on-screen. This character is an embarrassment to cinema and would be far more at home in Lucas' infantile 'Ewoks' cartoon.What could have been an excellent prequel exploring what moulded Darth Vader into the complex man he became was ruined by a plot that dithered between being positively childish and overly-political. There are scenes that drag on, bogged down with Padme and the Jedi dealing with the governmental side-plot, and then there are scenes where we have Anakin showing far more competence and ability than the Jedi, obviously trying to create in him a character who appeals to eight-year-old boys in the audience. The ten minute long Pod-race was just an advert to sell a computer game and just didn't need to be so long.Overall, this film is passable but really far from enjoyable. It would suit tiny would-be fans of the series who will eventually grow up to watch the original trilogy but any of secondary school age will be left disappointed and bored. Personally, I feel I'm better off just sticking with the originals and forgetting the prequels ever existed.",4,2,4,13 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dull, childish and drawn-out, a sequel that has nothing on the first film
","I loved the first 'Pirates of the Caribbean', glad to see Disney producing a refreshingly exciting and enthralling film that kept folk of all ages amused. Like many fans, I lived in wait for the much anticipated sequel 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'. But when it finally arrived on our screens three years later, I was left quite disappointed with the result.Set some months after the events of the first film, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' sees Will Turner's imminent plans to marry his sweetheart, aristocrat Elizabeth Swann, lie in ruins when vindictive English Lord Beckett, a man with an agenda of his own, arrests them for treason. He offers full pardons for the pair on the condition that Will retrieves Jack Sparrow's compass. From this point on, we follow the characters on a turbulent ride as Will eventually tracks down Sparrow only to be betrayed as the pirate uses the young man to settle a debt to Davey Jones, a sinister demonic captain of the infamous Flying Dutchman. Meanwhile, Elizabeth refuses to sit around waiting to be saved and escapes prison to search the high seas for her fiancé.There is no denying that Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley all play their respective roles of Sparrow, Will and Elizabeth with fervour while Bill Nighy is particularly top-notch as the malevolent and insidious Davy Jones. Equally, their co-stars give excellent performances, on occasion, even out-shining the stars as is the case of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, who play two of Sparrow's most intellectually-challenged crew members! The CGI in the film is also to a degree that shows no expense was spared nor were amateurs involved. Davey Jones' crew and ship were so visually stunning that the audience could be forgiven for thinking they were real such were the minute details that were heeded. The Kraken's destructive nature was also portrayed with chilling realism.No, the problem with this film lies not with the cast or visual effects but rather a lacklustre plot that is veers from being repetitive and dull to predictable to downright childish, at times. The scenes where Sparrow is trying to escape the cannibals features humour more suited to a five-year-old's slapstick cartoon and runs on for ages. The end scene where Will, Sparrow and Norrington fight in the wheel also seems to have no end, leaving anyone over twelve glancing at their watch wishing the scriptwriter would learn some restraint. The Will/Elizabeth/Sparrow triangle is something out of a cheap, trashy romance novel while the character depiction is a bit 'off'. Neither Elizabeth nor Sparrow are quite so likable this time around as we see them both doing some pretty deplorable things. Although Sparrow was no angel in the first film, he was a rogue with a heart of gold compared to this smug traitor who left me feeling he was due for some pay-back.Instead of an interesting plot utilising fascinating and eccentric characters to their fullest, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' relies solely on CGI and forced, infantile humour. What little sense of adventure and adversary in the film is drawn-out to the point where it just becomes tedious. It's almost as if Disney were hoping to completely coast on the success of the previous film so felt no effort was needed to be put into this film, deliberately ending it in such a way that the audience feels obliged to see the third film (which is to be released in 2007) if they want any resolution to the storyline.However, personally, I don't feel at all inclined to see the third film. In fact, at the moment, my disappointment with 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is such that I think I'm going to go the 'Matrix' route and just pretend the first film is the only film that exists.",4,5,11,28 July 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," It gave me an adequate Trek fix!
","I've been a Trek fan since the age of ten and it was the show that ultimately opened to door to the world of science fiction (and geekiness!) for me. So I do hold strong feelings for this franchise and that is why I swiver over my feelings for Abrams' films.The film opens with Kirk extensively breaking the Prime Directive and, while he does so with good intentions, he is portrayed to be much more devil-may-care and arrogant (perhaps, even adolescent) than Shatner's Kirk. But before he can suffer Starfleet's disciplinary action, Earth is attacked by a terrorist John Harrison. Determined to bring him to justice, Kirk and his crew set out after him only to discover nothing is what it seems.Benedict Camberbatch did a good job as the ruthless Harrison but, through no fault of his, the actual character portrayal within the story meant he never quite had the same complexity of the Joker or even Loki from the Marvel-verse. Not to ruin the film too much but I do think this is the result of this franchise being restricted to two films compared with the original films, which had a whole series to build upon. I can't complain about the Enterprise characters as I do think they all do their roles justice and are worthy successors (I can complain, however, that there just was not enough McCoy- give him more scenes in the next film!).In terms of the actual plot, it makes for a great popcorn flick that will appeal to general cinema goers who have no clue about Star Trek as well as being entertaining enough for Trek fans who do tolerate Abrams' films. As I said, it did lack some of the emotional appeal because the characters just do not have the history and level of deep friendship that we saw in the original films (and how can they when there is only meant to be a year between this film and the first one?). I also wish they would do more to recreate the Kirk/Spock/McCoy friendship that was such a part of the original series. McCoy barely has screen time here and I think that even despite being biased about my favourite character.In all, I do think it's worth a look. It's not fantastic nor does it compare to 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan' but it is an entertaining film that moves along well from what was established in the first film. I hope it doesn't take them as long as four years to produce a third film. One thing though, see it in 2D if possible. The 3D is pointless and a waste of money for those of us who have to fork out extra for 3D tickets. It's time Hollywood relegated 3D to kiddie films and cartoons.",7,9,27,8 May 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," An Epic Almost on the Scale of LotR
","As a loyal Harry Potter fan, it pains me to say this film totally blows all four HP films off the map and it's even in league with the excellent 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. It definitely deserves to rake it in at the box office and rank as Christmas number one. Based on second of the classic Narnia chronicles (the first in the series as CS Lewis intended), 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is centred around the four Pevensie children-- fifteen-year-old Peter, thirteen-year-old Susan, eleven-year-old Edmound and eight-year-old Lucy-- who are sent to the vast country estate following the London Blitz. There, the children discover a wardrobe which contains the path to the magical world of Narnia, dominated by the cruel and vile White Witch and her minions. As prophesised, it lies to the children to join forces with the majestic Aslan to lead Narnia to freedom.It's been many years since I read the book (far more than I like to think although I'm going to remedy that by re-reading it as soon as possible) but I felt that Ann Peacock did a wonderful job of adapting the novel to screen and fitting it into a measly two hours and twenty minutes. There obviously were some cuts made but everything that was important remained intact and the story stands well on the big screen, particularly the Stone Table scene and the battle.The characters were portrayed perfectly with Edmound being impudent without being totally hideous while Susan's bossiness is not too overbearing. Fans of Peter and Lucy will enjoy how they come across as the lead heroes of the film, both being depicted as brave and loyal in their own way. It is refreshing to see the characters depicted almost exactly as they are in the books, rather than being dumbed down or made out to be 'cool' just to appeal to children in the audience. Those who fear a repeat of the rather mediocre Harry Potter young cast spoiling the film need not worry as the four child actors were excellent from start to finish. Adorable wee Georgie Henley stole the show as Lucy despite her tender age (and this being her debut film) and Skandar Keynes managed to portray a careful balance with Peter, showing his traitorous side but also his bravery and kinder nature. I wouldn't be surprised if all four went onto do many other projects.However, it was Aslan's scenes that dominate even if he is a CGI character! I know many people were worried about this, unable to see past Jar-Jar Binks, but it worked well and you'd honestly think they had a real lion do the shots. And Liam Neeson's vocal work was brilliant in thundering across Aslan's strength and nobility. Tilda Swinton was just positively vile as the White Witch, exactly as she should be! She was able to carry off how wicked and callow the White Witch was in a way that will leave the audience close to horrified.Overall, this film should certainly go down as a classic in the years to come. Everything was done so well, from the acting to the CGI to the musical score to the cinematography, and I'm sure both children and adults will thoroughly enjoy themselves. For something produced by Disney, 'Narnia' delivers as awe-inspiring performance without pandering to toddlers or mutilating the book. If anything, I think the PG rating it was given in the UK might have been a tad complacent as young and sensitive children may find some scenes hard to stomach (I know I would have bawled my eyes out at the Stone Table scene had I watched it at six years old; I nearly did even now and I'm in my twenties!). I recommend this to anyone looking to see a decent Christmas film.",8,7,11,8 December 2005
Billy Elliot," Don't watch if depressed
","After all the hype about it, when I finally got around to watching it I found that this film wasn't as great as it was made to be. In fact, it had pretty much the same formula used in most British films. The setting is a depressing, dull (both in weather and in environment) area which feels suffocating just to watch and the characters are all working class who have no real future prospects and are forever stuck in a rut. It makes me wonder if all foreigners see the British like this.That said, Jamie Bell delivered an excellent performance and it's easy to see he is destined for a career in acting if he plays his cards right. Gary Lewis and Julie Walters were also exceptional and you really felt that they both loved and cared for this kid in their own way.",Null,2,4,16 September 2002
The Mummy," Popcorn fun-- 1999's version of 'Indiana Jones'
","If you're looking for a deep, insightful drama into the rich history of Egypt then look elsewhere because this is not for you. If you just want to see a film full of fun, adventure and a dash of romance all set in an exotic location then 'The Mummy' is the answer.The story is set in 1924 Egypt where our hero is gregarious American Rick O'Connell, who is hired to take geeky English archaeologist Evey Carnahan and her wimpy brother Jonathan to a hidden tomb where they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a wrathful mummy who is intent on destroying the world. As the trio struggle to send Imhotep back to his grave, they are joined by Ardeth Bey, a member of the sacred Madjai entrusted to ensure the mummy never escapes.In much the same thread of a Nineties version of 'Indiana Jones', 'The Mummy' is has the usual formula of brave heroes and treacherous or cowardly antagonists. Brendan Fraser is very likable as the wise-cracking, reluctant hero O'Connell; I admit I despaired of him after seeing 'George of the Jungle' but he redeemed himself here showing he is capable of delivering comedy without the stupid faces and making a twit of himself. Rachel Weisz's Evey walked a careful line between being a bookish English woman without delving into being stereotypical view of the English. And John Hannah was hilarious as Jonathan with Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay providing the females of the audience with something nice to look at! But it is Kevin O'Connor as the traitorous Beni who steals the limelight with some of the best lines of the film.'The Mummy' is a typical example of a Hollywood action film, full of thrills, humour, stunts and a scare or two. It's a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, especially on a cold night when you want to imagine yourself in a sunnier climate. Great fun!",8,2,2,5 May 2006
The Others," Horror at its best
","At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, 'The Others' is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.'The Others' is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart, who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photo-sensitive children ten-year-old Anne and six-year-old Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness, in deference to the children's condition, and Grace's husband is lost in war, only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning, three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion, despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts, to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted, her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar, closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there's no-one in the room. Grace, deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don't exist, initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can't deny there is something ominous about the house...Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace, who does love her children dearly even if she doesn't always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy, as the three servants, are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on, leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience, both children given first-class depictions of their characters, showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann, in particular, excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.'The Others' is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film, in the tradition of 'The Exorcist' and 'The Devil's Backbone', it instead relies upon more old-fashion methods of frightening the audience, which are far more effective. The story is well-paced, leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters' motives are right to the end.This film has to be one of the best horror films I've ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the value of suspense and a good fright.",9,11,14,19 October 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," Magical film for young and old!
","Hands down, 'My Neighbour Totoro' is far superior to any film ever produced by Disney and that's including my personal favourites 'The Lion King' and 'Hercules'.It revolves around two young girls Satsuki (aged around eight) and Mei (aged around three) who move to a new house while also coping with their mother's illness in the resilient, sweet way young children have in dealing with problems. They then discover these furry totoro creatures only ever seen by children and through their new friends, they are able to face their fears.You can actually feel the magic when you watch this. The totoros are adorable and their haunting silence only intensifies their beauty and the two children are so innocent and captivating that you completely empathise with their delight at meeting these fabled creatures.Although I watched it a few times when I was around 12, I rediscovered this in Disney Land (Disney own the rights now) and walked from the Britain exhibit in EPCOT back to Japan to buy the cuddly Totoro toy which is now my most prized possession from that Florida holiday. At the moment, this excellent film is not on DVD in Britain for some criminal reason, I hope now that Disney own it they will release it soon enough. I would certainly reccommend it to anyone of any age.",10,4,5,22 January 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Fair but, please, let the franchise rest now
","After the rather dismal 'Dead Man's Chest', I was worried that we'd get more of the same in this film to the point where I actually wavered on whether I should see it or not. However, thankfully, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' reclaimed some of the sparkle on the franchise that the second film lost. This film sees Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa strive to rescue Jack from the world of death itself as Cutler Beckett plots to rid the seas of all pirates.In terms of the characters, I felt as if there wasn't enough interaction between Will, Jack and Elizabeth as each went in their own direction and the film suffered as a result since these are meant to be the main characters. It was the minor characters who had more of a presence, especially in the comedy scenes. The crew of the Pearl were fleshed out more to a degree that they were actually more interesting than the three leads. Duos Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, in the role of the Black Pearl's not-too-bright crew members, and Angus Barnett and Giles New, as representing the daft section of the British Navy as Mullrog and Murtogg, were all hilarious in scenes that were probably the best of the film. Jack Davenport's Norrington brought some sense of drama to the film and it's a shame he wasn't used more. Also, under-used was Keith Richards, who played Jack's father. It felt as if he was brought in just for the sake of 'look who's play Jack's dad' and the role seemed to serve little purpose.The special effects were top-notch, especially when it came to the battle scenes and the Flying Dutchman crew, however, gone were the days when films could coast on dazzling CGI. Plot is what counts. This time around, there was less tedious, over-long scenes designed to amuse small children in the audience (a la 'Dead Man's Chest') but there were many things that could have been improved on. The storyline was rather clunky and choppy as it tried to build up to the final battle between the pirates and the English. It felt as if the scriptwriter just wanted to have a juicy battle but there was little thought put into how to get to that point in a logical manner. The plot wasn't helped by the fact there was no character development for the three leads, who were all reduced to bit parts, thus leaving the film struggling to link to the first two of the trilogy.If you were disappointed with 'Dead Man's Chest', it is worth seeing this film to see all was not lost but don't expect anything of the excellence of the first film. It's good as a means of spending an afternoon but it won't bowl over many people over fourteen. And certainly, it will left me hoping this was the end and there would be no fourth film. It's time Hollywood learns that it can't just rely on special effects and actors' good looks to sell films to intelligent cinema-goers.",5,2,6,31 May 2007
The Prestige," Excellent psychological/sci-fi thriller
","'The Prestige' is a classy thriller that appeals to an intelligent audience and is effortlessly one of the best films of the year. Set against the backdrop of a very authentic Victorian London, the film sees two magicians, rich toff Robert Angier and working class Alfred Borden, determined to make their mark in their expertise of thrilling their audiences. But their friendly rivalry descends into bitter, obsessive feud when Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife and relations between them sour to a life-threatening extent.The acting in this film is exemplary but then you expect no better considering the actors involved. Christian Bale plays the cool, reserved Borden who maintains his control in contrast to Hugh Jackman's the volatile Angier, a man whose hatred has turned him from suave to almost unhinged in his fanatical need to trump his rival. Michael Caine brings a calm, maturity to the film as Angier's loyal friend Cutter while relative newcomer Rebecca Hall gives an affecting performance as Borden's loving but increasingly bewildered wife.The setting of 'The Prestige' has clearly been put together with love. Victorian London is flawless in depiction, giving the eerie atmosphere of the darker era where there was a sharp divide between rich and poor, the working class were relegated to slums and jails were hellish. The costumes were wonderful in design, especially some of Angier's suits which do well in enhancing Jackman's aristocratic role.The actual plot is filled to the brim with twists and turns that should satisfy any mystery-lover. Sci-fi fans may piece the puzzle together quicker than those left hanging until the end but this should not put anyone off since what really makes the story is the interplay between Borden and Angier. The animosity-- largely kindled by grief, guilt and masculine arrogance-- is fascinating to see how far two men, who could have had successful lives were there not this feud, go in their pursuit to 'beat' the other. Caine's character Cutter offers nice input in showing how far can one man stand back and watch it all happen before he is forced to intervene. There is also a very interesting ethical debate raised, that I won't reveal in deference to those who haven't watched the film.This masterpiece is highly recommended to those bored of conventional, run-of-the-mill blockbusters and want something deeper for a change.",9,2,3,20 November 2006
Silent Hill," Captures the eeriness and fear of a real horror flick
","I've never played the video game 'Silent Hill', which this film is based on, so I came to it with a different perspective of someone looking to see a good film rather than expecting a faithful adaptation. But I can quite honestly say how refreshing it is to finally see a horror film that is actually a horror, with not a psychotic serial killer or air-headed teen in sight.The film revolves around Rose Da Silva, whose eight-year-old daughter Sharon is being plagued by episodes of sleep-walking that are leading the child into dangerous situations. In all of her dreams, Sharon mentions 'Silent Hill' and her mother's research leads her to discovering this place actually exists in the form of an abandoned town with an eerie history. Rose determines that to cure Sharon of her nightmares, they must go to the town but, on arrival, their journey then takes a terrifying turn. After being knocked unconscious upon crashing her car, Rose awakes to find Sharon missing, and so she is forced to travel deeper into the horror that is Silent Hill.Radha Mitchell, who played Rose, really captures the spirit of a mother determined to find her child no matter what the consequences are to herself. Laurie Holden's Cybil Bennett, the policewoman who comes to Rose's aid, was a surprising character as while she first came across as a buff masculine she-cop, she quickly revealed herself to be multi-dimensional in the form of someone who feels protectiveness, caring, pain and fear. And Alice Krige was just excellent as the loathsomely arrogant Christabella.What is truly brilliant about this film is it works hard to create a chilling atmosphere of a desolate town that is other-worldly and disturbed, which leaves the audience terrified before anything even happens . The visual effects as the town falls into darkness were top-class and I loved how they used actors for the roles of the zombies rather than relying on CGI. Other producers could learn a lesson or two from 'Silent Hill' as the traditional approach of actors in make-up was far more effective and creepier than computerised monsters that tend to leave audiences nit-picking rather than petrified.The only real let-down was the last scene as 'twist' endings have been so over-done that to see one in a film that was unique in every other scene, it was rather a disappointment. That said, the solid script, interesting characters and visuals combine to create a film that is tense, chilling and terrifying. 'Silent Hill' is not just for fans of the game so don't let that put you off if you're on the look-out for a decent horror film.",7,2,4,18 May 2006
The Polar Express," Will Become A Christmas Classic
","I have to say that I adored 'The Polar Express'. It was just the sort of film I needed to truly get me into the Christmas mood. The story revolves around a young boy, who is coming to an age where he is doubting Santa Claus' existence, until the Polar Express- a magical train destined for the North Pole- takes him and a group of other young children on a journey to Santa and to reaffirm their faith in Christmas.I had reservations about the use of CGI animation since I felt it really only worked for stories about cute animals but having seen the film, the CGI was the best way to capture the spirit of the film. It really wouldn't have worked as well in live action, the sense of other-worldly magic would have been lost. And as it was, the artwork was beautiful, especially the snowy mountainous scenery that the train passes through.This film took me back to my childhood and that tingly-feeling every child gets on Christmas Eve in anticipation of Santa's visit. The story was sweet and innocent without being nauseating, and I think every one of us can empathise with the boy who wants to believe in Santa but is growing away from the innocence of early childhood and faith in magic. Much like Raymond Briggs' 'The Snowman', I predict 'The Polar Express' will go down as a Christmas classic. It certainly makes a pleasant change that this year's Christmas film was actually about Christmas and I hope they make the re-release of this film an annual Christmas event.",9,101,127,20 December 2004
Empire of the Sun," A war film with a difference
","'Empire of the Sun' is probably one of the most unique war films out there as it doesn't balk from showing the harsh realities of war but we see it all through the eyes of a child. And, in many ways, it is a rather tragic war drama since it deals with both the deaths of soldiers and civilians but also the death of a child's innocence as he struggles to comprehend the brutal truth of the situation he is in.The hero of the film is twelve-year-old Jim, an English boy living in China with his upper class family in 1941 when the Japanese invade. Separated from his parents, he is left to cope on the streets alone only to be captured and placed in a Japanese PoW camp. As he befriends fellow British and American captives, Jim struggles to find his feet in a world where the days of being pampered are over but also where he is forced to take his first premature steps into manhood when, at heart, he is still very much a child. When the war finally draws to an end with Japan's defeat, Jim is left to find his parents, no longer the little boy he was when they were first separated.Welsh-born Christian Bale was just absolutely first class as young Jim. He would only have been twelve or so when filming but his performance proved there are some child actors who can show incredible talent that out-shines adult counterparts and he brings innocence, hope and spirit to his character. It's not surprising he is one of the few child actors who grew up able to carve an acting career in adulthood instead of falling by the wayside. The adult cast of John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers are also solid, supporting Bale's performance without pushing themselves to the forefront as this is very much his film.One of the most beautiful things about this film is that it can be enjoyed by those of all ages. I was about ten when I first saw 'Empire of the Sun', perceiving it then as an adventure and cheering Jim along on his journey. When I saw it again about eight or so years later, I was able to better appreciate the themes of lost innocence, determination, loss, hope and spirit that saw a generation survive through World War Two. Much like the Japanese anime 'Grave of the Fireflies', this film strives to portray Jim's tenacity without losing the message that war is no place for a child and the innocent always suffer first in the midst of battle. Directed with masterful grace by Steven Spielberg, 'Empire of the Sun' is probably one of his best films yet.",9,3,7,14 May 2006
The Village," If the ending wasn't ruined beforehand, it would have been a perfect suspenseful thriller
","While not quite as good as 'Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense', I found 'The Village' very enjoyable. It was eerily atmospheric with the usual unexpected twists M. Night Shyamalan delights in. This film is a reminder that with good camera-work and an original story, CGI and computer-added effects are not always needed.The story centres around an American village of the Nineteenth Century that is surrounded by woods inhabited with strange creatures. There is a truce between the villagers and the creatures that so long as the villagers don't wear red nor breach the woods then they will not be harmed. This truce is violated when a young blind girl has to cross through the woods to bring medicine for an injured loved one.Yes, it's a vague summary but I can't say too much without ruining the twists (which there are three of).Some critics have said they saw the ending a mile off but somehow I doubt it and I imagine these critics are the sort of people who criticise a film to make themselves look 'sophisticated' and 'intelligent'. I think Shyamalan has created another masterpiece and directed excellent performances from the cast, in particular William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard, although Sigourney Weaver did seem a little under used.One major problem is that this is the sort of film that should be released in the US and the UK on the same date. Shyamalan could find a drop in UK sales primarily because some UK cinema-goers will know exactly what the twists and may avoid the film are thanks to a number of inconsiderate American viewers who saw the film then in their reviews announced to the world what happens without leaving spoiler warnings. Therefore, I and a few of my friends went in knowing exactly what would happen, and like all of Shyamalan's films, knowing did take some of the fun from the storyline.",7,0,0,20 August 2004
The Hills Have Eyes," Had me running for the hills...in boredom
","A remake of Wes Craven's 1977 version, 'The Hills Have Eyes' left me feeling utterly unimpressed and, while I have not seen the original, if it is anything like this then I wonder why they even bothered . The plot revolves around a family lost in the desert and end up being picked off one-by-one by mutants, and it was basically one huge disappointment with only a few half-hearted scares, instead relying on excessive violence, blood, and gore to gain a reaction from the audience. In fact, the only real chill I got was in the ten minutes of trailers in the beginning when more intriguing flicks such as 'The Omen', 'The Dark' and 'An American Haunting' were advertised.I am no conservative when it comes to violence in horror/action films since most sensible people understand it is just fiction yet nevertheless this film just left a bad taste in my mouth. Rather than using a sharp plot and clever camera work to deliver the chills, this was just a case of 'look how many gory ways we can kill people! Look at how we can splash blood around'. There was even a gratuitous rape scene that left me sickened, rather than terrified, that the scriptwriter could stoop to such depths to try to shock us. And there was even the typical predictable ending to gear us up for a possible sequel (though hopefully no Hollywood studio will sanction that).The result was a flick that is clearly just intended to appeal to lads in their late teens and twenties who still get a kick out of seeing blood and guts flying around. For real horror fans, I'd advise waiting for the more promising horror/chiller flicks to be released through the year. Or, if you are really desperate for the mutants, check out 'The X-Files' episode 'Home', which does the whole concept in a more intelligent, frightening manner.",2,5,11,15 March 2006
Warrior," Much more than just a film about fighting
","While I am partial to a film featuring martial arts (largely because that has style whereas boxing/wrestling/whatever seems so thuggish), I don't have any interest in professional fighting whatsoever. I only went to see 'Warrior' as there was little else to see in the cinema. And I was very glad that I did because it was a surprisingly good film that is much more than men beating each other up.'Warrior' is a film about a broken family haunted by past domestic abuse, alcoholism and grudges. Tommy Conlan (Tom Hardy) was once considered a prodigy in the mixed martial arts cage but, now an adult, he is a Marine carrying much anger and hurt. By comparison, his estranged elder brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton)is a physics teacher leading a settled life with his wife and daughters until, thanks to greedy bankers (yes, we all know about them), he is at risk of losing his home. For very different reasons, the two brothers embark on the path to try to win a major tournament-- a quest that will leading to them being reunited after years of separation. In the midst of it, their father Paddy (Nick Nolte) is a recovering alcoholic who is struggling to regain the trust of the sons whose childhood he wrecked.Perhaps this could easily have been a bland, violence-filled film but thanks to strong characterisation that was brought to life by three excellent actors, we have a story that transcends a basic plot about fighting. Hardy and Nolte excel at portraying two haunted characters who can't let go of their pasts while Edgerton is great as the character who has managed to carve a decent life for himself despite his boyhood hurts.I do wish we could have had a more rounded ending, however. It would have been nice to see where Paddy's place in his sons' lives after the final fight was. But that is probably the only negative that I could find and I suppose that sometimes there are aspects that need to be left for the viewer to decide for themselves.After a year of rather mediocre films, 'Warrior' is compelling viewing that both entertains and also offers an emotional aspect to the audience. And certainly do not be put off by the fact that it features cage fighting because that is such a small part of this film. Well recommended (and, on a side note, Hardy looks more than ready to play Bane in 'The Dark Knight Returns').",Null,3,7,24 September 2011
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Best of the three
","Although this film isn't all that I'd hoped it would be, I believe that it was the best of the three 'Harry Potter' films so far, thanks largely due to director Alfonso Cuaron. In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.The child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.The adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!One of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.However, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. Also, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.At the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.",8,64,99,31 May 2004
Spirited Away," A film Disney should learn lessons from
","My previous experience with Studio Ghibli began and ended with 'My Neighbour Totoro' but upon seeing the fantastic 'Spirited Away', I feel as if a whole new world of anime and Hayao Miyazaki has just opened up to me. Until now, apart from the odd Disney flick and, of course, 'My Neighbour Totoro', I had long consigned animation to childhood but this film is a perfect example of how how rich and diverse even an animated film can be.'Spirited Away' centres on ten-year-old Chihiro, a little Japanese girl who accidentally stumbles upon the Spirit World while exploring a mysterious passageway with her parents. When her parents are turned into pigs for stealing food, it falls to young Chirhiro and Haku, her guide in this strange new world, to save them before they become bacon. Not only are the characters well-depicted and engaging (with a few adorable little creatures added in to gush over!) but the story is very involving. During Chihiro's quest, not only do we see she and Haku grew as characters but we learn much about Japanese mythology and the moral of how not everything is as it seems. The atmospheric and other-worldly quality of the film leaves the audience feeling as if they too have joined the young heroine in this strange new land where the impossible seems possible.Although this film will no doubt appeal to young children who will easily identify with Chihiro, there is a dark air to 'Spirited Away' that will draw in teenagers and adults. Certainly, older viewers will be left awe-struck by the intelligence and strength of the plot and the characters. Highly recommended to anime fans and those who are just looking for a film that is unique and interesting.",10,16,31,6 October 2004
Independence Day," Clichéd but in a fun way
","I have to admit that, as far as Hollywood blockbusters go, 'Independence Day' has always been a favourite. The film starts on July 2nd, when the planet is thrown into chaos when number of alien starships enter the atmosphere and settle into orbit over various key cities worldwide before launching a devastating attack. Survivors-- including the American President and his staff, an Air Force pilot and his girlfriend, a drunk and his three kids and the cable repair man/genius who first discovered the aliens' intent-- congregated at a secret facility at Area 51 then on July 4th, they launch their counterattack.The characters were stereotypical but the actors, including Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch and Robert Loggia, all gave decent performances despite the cheesy dialogue they were sometimes lumbered with. Even then, the 'good' characters were all likable enough and you wanted to see the good guys strive through and win (unlike Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' where I wished someone would just dish the main characters up to the aliens) while the token difficult, arrogant politician played for 'boos' with good effect.In terms of the storyline, it was predictable and, at times, sugary but it was fun! It has everything from action to romance to humour to drama and even handled death with some degree of poignancy, and all this before the standard geeky character saves the world using the 1996 version of HG Wells' virus idea. The special effects used for destruction of the cities were impressive, even eleven years on, as was those used to depict the combat between the American planes and the aliens. It was quite breathtaking when I saw it in the cinema back in '96.The main complaint about 'Independence Day' seems to be over the depiction of Americans saving the world. As a Briton myself, I do find the idea that every other country would sit back and expect America to save us a tad idiotic, not to mention I like to think the majority of mature Americans don't need to be spoon-fed patriotism, but you can't expect deep thought from a blockbuster. And the President's nauseating Independence Day speech was good for a laugh.Overall, this is a fun film that was the first to update the whole 'disaster' flick genre. Don't nitpick but just kick back and enjoy.",8,5,10,21 October 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Fun flick but not the X-Men
","I found 'X-Men: The Last Stand' to be enjoyable enough for an action flick yet it was lacks the essence of the comic books and leaves you wishing they had just waited for Bryan Singer to finish with 'Superman Returns' so he could work on this.This film sees tensions between humans and mutants reach an all-time high as the government turn a mutant 'cure' into a weapon, something Magneto is all to quick to exploit for his Mutant Freedom cause. Meanwhile, Jean Grey has returned from the dead to unleash the darker side of her powers and her old team-mates are forced to realise she is now the enemy.The usual main protagonist characters of Xavier, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Jean, Rogue and Bobby are back and in usual form (with the exception of Jean, who has undergone a few changes!). Without giving too much away, how this film differs from the previous two is that we don't get almost full focus on Wolverine, Rogue and Xavier this time and instead Storm and Bobby are given the chance to play a larger role while new and lesser known characters are brought into the limelight. Kitty Pryde is finally given a bit of a personality rather than just being 'the girl who can walk through walls' and we get to meet Beast, who is wonderfully brought to life by Kelsey Grammar. On the sidelines, there is also more of Colossus and an introduction to Warren 'Angel' Worthington.On the side of the antagonists, there is a deeper insight into Magneto's character and the audience are truly left wondering whether he is unhinged or just a determined man whose goals may be harsh but are right way for mutants. It's a dilemma that makes clear why Magneto is never short of supporters and Sir Ian McKellen's excellently vehement performance in the role serves to highlight there is much more to the character than his just being a stereotypical 'bad guy'. It's also interesting to see how he and Xavier were once good friends and even as their friendship has cooled when their differing goals for the future of mutants has divided them, there is still an underlying sense of respect between them. Pyro is back and though he tries to come across in a darker light, instead he just seems like a moody, self-absorbed brat who is in a huff because Bobby was teacher's pet. On the other hand, Vinnie Jones is effective as Juggernaut, getting to indulge in his real-life thuggery in the role.The special effects are as spectacular as expected, with impressive action scenes (especially in the final battle) as we see the mutants' powers brought to life. So, what's the problem then? Well, quite simply, it wasn't all that was promised in the second film. X2 was superior because it did portray the idea that the X-Men are a team who all work together whereas here leaves you wondering 'where is everyone?' Also, Phoenix was not the awesome creature hinted at in X2 or depicted as in the comic books and instead she just seemed like Jean suffering from a bit of PMT. As such, there wasn't any sense of shock when she unleashed her powers but rather a sense that you wished she'd just give herself a shake and grow up. Purists of the comic books will definitely find it hard to digest the fact this film veers further away from comic book canon in the same vein as the previous two films did, especially the timeline of events like Angel's introduction and the fate of three major characters.'X-Men: The Last Stand' will keep most people amused for a couple of hours, if they ignore comic book mythology, but I personally was left feeling as if it wasn't the X-Men that I loved in the comic books and Nineties cartoon show. And the ending is such that it is both a satisfying way to round off a trilogy and also leaves room for a possible fourth film, I hope they just reboot and start afresh if they ever do go back to the franchise. Maybe then, we can get a Cyclops and Storm who aren't a B-characters, the real Phoenix, an adult Rogue, a Gambit and many other important elements missing from the film series.",6,6,12,25 May 2006
Transformers," Bring on the nostalgia!
","I have to admit I loved this film and, perhaps, as someone who was a child in the Eighties at the height of the Transformers craze has some bearing on that. I was a tomboy who loved the toys and watched the cartoon on Saturday mornings so there is a certain amount of sentimental nostalgia when watching this film. However, that doesn't detract from the fact this was a very enjoyable blockbuster.The premise of 'Transformers' sees war between two robotic races-- the Autobots, who are good and honourable, and the Decepticons, who are evil and cruel-- on the planet of Cybertron as they are vying for control of the powerful Allspark weapon. The weapon eventually finds its way to Earth but, in his search for it, the leader of the Decepticons, Megatron, is frozen in the polar ice cap. Years later, seventeen-year-old Sam buys his first car, unaware it is Bumblebee, one of the Autobots who have come to Earth to find the Allspark. War again is looming between the Autobots and Decepticons, this time with Earth as the battleground.The human characters of Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela, the military and government people aren't irritating distractions from the robots. Sam is old enough to realistically be embroiled in this situation without coming across as some precocious little moppet who should be tucked at home in bed and we should be thankful they chose the main character to be seventeen instead of ten. Shia LeBeouf, who played Sam, brought humour and the human touch to the film. It also made a pleasant change to see the military portrayed to have some brains instead of carrying on like a bunch of reckless fools who make moronic decisions time-and-again.As for the robots, the CGI used was of excellent quality. The visual effects were able to re-create them in a manner that doesn't leave the audience sitting there thinking, 'this is so fake', which would have ruined the film. The robots were also depicted in a manner that gave them individual personalities that brought their characters to life, which was essential because these aren't meant to be mindless drones.This film is, ultimately, a Hollywood blockbuster, not some deep-thinking epic. People do need to remember that when judging 'Transformers'. The plot is involving without requiring a vast intellect or powerful thoughts and yes, there are plenty of explosions and fight scenes. Take it for what it is and I imagine many people upwards of twelve who just want to see a fun film will enjoy this. It is definitely a must for those in their twenties who grew up with Transformers; nothing like re-living your childhood once again!",6,2,5,28 July 2007
Children of Men," Bleak yet thought-provoking
","This gem of a film might not burst the box office with the hallmarks of an autumn blockbuster but, like the excellent 'V for Vendetta', 'Children of Men' has to be seen for it is a film with a powerful storyline and hidden lessons that must be learnt. Based on the novel by PD James, whose forte is usually crime fiction, this film is set in the bleak 2027 when the planet is on the brink of social and economic collapse and worldwide infertility has meant no child has been born in eighteen years. Against the backdrop of a London divided by anarchy and a totalitarian government, jaded former peace activist Theo Faron is forced to set aside his disenchantment to help a pregnant girl named Kee across the country to deliver her to sanctuary.With a strong cast comprised of a variety of talented actors, 'Children of Men' never had to worry about delivering a good performance in that department. Clive Owen was perfectly cast as the disillusioned Theo, world-weary haunted by his past until his protective instincts are rekindled in Kee and her child. Pam Ferris and Michael Caine were excellent as always as Miriam and Jasper respectively, two likable characters who display quiet heroics and eliciting empathy from the audience for their determination and kind natures. And Claire-Hope Ashitey delivered a top performance as Kee, despite the fact she would have been barely eighteen when filming this and still so new to acting. If she had been dire in her role, this film probably would have failed but, thankfully, she proved she has acting talent in her ability to depict the determination, vulnerability and strength of her character.'Children of Men' is certainly a very chilling film that would leave even the most complacent worrying what the future holds for mankind. Watching scenes of a desolate England where refugees are herded up like cattle then transported to concentration camps as world away from the luxury enjoyed by the rich, where corpses of people and animals rot by road sides and bombings are the norm, the imagery is terrifying to the core because it could so easily happen if hope is ever lost. The film was successful in showing cruel governments can be as destructive as terrorists and the lines between justice and the unjust can blur if one forgets their convictions. There were a variety of nice touches that only strengthened the story of the film such as how pets had taken the place of children in people's lives, how heroes don't have to be gun-totting Steven Segals and the sound of an infant's cry can touch the soul of even the hardest of hearts, especially when it comes in a time where the sound of children's laughter had long fallen silent.It would have been interesting if the film had further touched upon exactly why females couldn't carry babies and reflected on how the world reacted at the time this realisation was starting to sink in. It would also have been nice to see how the rest of the UK had fared since England had obviously gone to pot, despite refugees from countries which had already crumbled seeking asylum there, and if Kee was really a sole miracle or were there other pregnant women out there offering the planet a second chance. That said, the film did not suffer an iota for not touching upon these issues.This is certainly a film for 'V for Vendetta' fans and for those who, every once in a while, like a film that leaves them pondering over the issues raised in the plot even after the end credits have rolled. 'Children of Men' is also a film that the leaders of the world should see because maybe mass infertility isn't a problem for the here and now but there are lessons to be learnt on how war, hopelessness and destruction can destroy us all.",9,3,7,5 October 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Great Depiction of a Favourite Book!
","As a fan of the original 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' film, I wondered if I could enjoy this remake (especially when I saw the Oompa Loompas sans yellow faces and green hair!). And the childish trailers for the films hardly did it any favours in trying to entice audiences over eight. However, from the moment the film began, I knew that I was onto a winner.Tim Burton and John August have managed to create a film that brings in the best of the Roald Dahl book without rehashing the novel word-by-word. They are also not afraid to show that the book is not some sickly-sweet fairytale but a dark story of poverty, bratty children and adults who can be rather cruel and malicious when it suits them. It also retains the point that children are often what their parents raise them to be, whether they want to or not (ie, Veruca's parents spoil her so she grows to be a brat, Mike's parents are too soft on him so he rules the roost while Wonka's father deprived him harshly of goodies without explaining he was just trying to do what's best for his son so young Willy rebelled). Perhaps, with that in mind, this might not be a suitable film for very young or sensitive children who are used to a warmer world being depicted on-screen.While Johnny Depp couldn't quite capture the same maliciousness of Willy Wonka in a way that Gene Wilder was able to capture, his Michael Jackson-esquire performance was still rather creepy and disturbing. Depp also managed to depict a rapport between his character and young Charlie, played wonderfully by Freddie Highmore. There seemed to be a real brotherly relationship between the two (and it was interesting that the role of the big brother was taken by Charlie while the emotionally immature Wonka was cast as the little brother who needed to be taught the value of family over material possessions) that was lacking in the original film where Wonka didn't really connect with Charlie until the final few minutes of the film.The children in the film are all excellent, especially when one considers most of them are newcomers aged no older than twelve or so. Freddie Highmore was successful in bringing the mix of vulnerability and inner strength to Charlie making the audience truly empathise with the character and cheer him on. However, overall, the prize has to go to Julia Winter, who was perfect as the atrociously spoilt Veruca Salt, and Jordan Fry, who depicted a hideously annoying Mike Teevee.However, the film was not without its bad points. For one, the songs sang by the Oompa Loompas was inferior compared to the those in the original. Too much was done to 'jazz' them up and they ended up lacking the rhythm of the original songs that left the audience wanting to join in.But it's the Americanisms of the film that causes it to drop a few points in my mind. Yes, this was a film made by Hollywood but American children will not go into meltdown if the British references of the book were retained. Charlie is an English child yet this film has him referring to 'dollars' (very odd considering he is living in England) and 'vacations' instead of 'holidays'. And is there really a need to have the British characters to refer to the chocolate as 'candy'? It would have been a nicer touch if the American characters used American terms and the British characters used British terms. Instead, the use of Americanisms just left me feeling Hollywood was dumbing down in much the same way 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' was dumbed down in both novel and film version in deference to the American audience. Maybe Hollywood needs to remember that in a country where school pupils as young as eight are made to memorise the name of fifty states and capitals, American children are far more intelligent than they are obviously given credit for by film producers and book publishers.Having said that, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is an excellent film that I would recommend to everyone from families to more mature cinema-goers. It's story appeals to all age groups without resorting to gooey, nauseating scenes and there is something for fans of the book and original film as well as those who might never have heard of Charlie and Wonka before.",7,6,10,4 August 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Finally, an HP film worthy of the name
","While 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' isn't quite the epic that fans of the books had hoped the HP films would grow to be, it is a worthy film and joins 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as the most redeeming of the film series. OotP sees Harry, now aged fifteen and more a man than a child, entering his Fifth Year at Hogwarts. Although Ron and Hermione continue to provide unyielding friendship and support, our hero is bitter and jaded in the aftermath of Cedric Diggory's death and questions his role in bringing down destiny. In addition to his burdens, he also has to deal with the new harsh, unsympathetic DADA teacher Umbridge, appointed by the Ministry and determined to discredit Harry's claim that darkness stalks the wizarding world once more, and Voldemort plundering his mind through telepathic (leglimency, for fans) means.As per usual, the adult cast of the film are exemplary and I think we expect no less from these British veterans. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and Robbie Coltrane all succeed wonderfully in bringing their characters to life, despite the fact they still don't appear in enough scenes. Gary Oldman, as Black, and Remus Lupin, as Lupin, are both back again and continue to perform their roles well. Imelda Staunton was absolutely excellent as Umbridge, depicting the character as almost a manic mix of a smug Margaret Thatcher, a deranged Hyacinth Bucket and as obsessed with Minister of Magic as Anne Wilkes was of her favourite author in 'Misery'! In regards to the younger cast, Daniel Radcliffe continues to grow in his role. He still struggles a bit with Harry's darker emotions (in part, I believe, down to the fact that Radcliffe is more natural at comedy) but he is able to maintain the character's moodiness without making a mess. Emma Watson, unfortunately, remains in the 'over-acting' mode that left her performance in 'Goblet of Fire' so irritating. Someone needs to tell the girl to relax if she is to ever achieve a more natural performance. Rupert Grint definitely shines out. His laid-back, quiet nature works well in portraying Ron's loyalty to Harry and his determination to be there for his friends and family. New to the cast is Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, who depicted the character's dreamy, head-in-the-clouds manner to a T. Of the young cast, she is the one who most accurately brings her character to life.Michael Goldenberg, the scriptwriter who steps in Steve Kloves' shoes in the first change to the scriptwriting role since PS, does an excellent job and I wish he could have stayed on for 'Half-Blood Prince'. He quite rightly focused the film primarily on the lead character, rather than the trio as a team, since OotP is very much Harry's story where he feels alone in the world as he struggles to accept his destiny. I have a feeling Kloves, who very obviously favours Hermione, wouldn't have been able to achieve this in his zeal to give his favourite screen-time.Goldenberg also provides mature dialogue, that reflects on the characters' British-ness, and scenes that allow the viewers to both empathise and feel exasperated with Harry's moods (he cut down the number of tantrums Harry has, which works better in order to retain sympathy for the character). He's also toned down the selfishness of Sirius Black compared to the book and the depth of hatred between Snape and Harry/the Marauders. In a way, I think this does work better for the film otherwise-- without access to Harry's thoughts-- we'd be left wondering why he even bothers himself with Black.Also new to the production team is David Yates, as the director, and what a welcome change he is. Yates, whose previous projects are British television dramas, is not so entrenched in Hollywood and this is what these films desperately needed to give them a bit of class expected from a British franchise. Too much dumbing down and pandering to small children and the shallow masses, in an attempt to turn these films into popcorn blockbusters, are what have prevented them from becoming as great as they could have been.I did think the film should have ended on the darker note of the book instead of trying to deliver hope when Harry was feeling no such thing. In the book, after everything he'd been through, Harry was shown to be at his lowest ebb and this depression to his character wasn't retained in the film. I also felt a certain someone's death could have been better reflected on; I don't think Harry's grief, shock, anger and despair was properly portrayed. I also didn't like the light-hearted music during the scenes where Umbridge is taking firm control of the school. Her actions are meant to cruel and constricting, not humorous.Overall, I think OotP provides hope for the HP films yet (a series that will have to carry the burden of continuing the hype since the final book is released on 21/07/07, meaning the interest in the franchise could wane if things aren't done properly). For the first time, I came out quite satisfied that nothing too essential had been missed out nor had characters been greatly mis-handled. The only reason I still favour PoA is because it focused more on the adult characters, who I prefer. Nevertheless, OotP is an enjoyable film that shows that HP isn't for children anymore (please don't bring your toddler to this as they will either end up bored or traumatised) and this has to be reflected in the tone of the script, the depiction of the characters and in the performances of the young cast. Sadly, with Kloves back in the seat for HBP, it's hard to know whether this vein with be maintained (especially since he might not be able to resist the temptation of focusing on the romance and Hermione scenes to the detriment of the actual plot).",7,5,10,17 July 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Almost as enjoyable as the novel
","Having read Chris Tookey's very disparaging review in the 'Daily Mail', I was of two minds to see this film. I'm glad I decided to ignore Tookey and see for myself as, having enjoyed the film, I now suspect he was allowing his own right-wing prejudices and snobby nature to colour his view of the film as a number of others have done. Based on Dan Brown's best-selling novel, 'The Da Vinci Code' sees Professor Robert Langdon, a leading American symbologist, caught in the midst of a baffling mystery when he is suspected of murdering Jacques Sauniere, the curator of the Louvre. Determined to clear his name and discover the truth over the clues Sauniere managed to leave behind before he died, Langdon joins forces with the victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu. But on their trail is sinister monk Silas as Langdon and Neveu soon discover there are those who are not ready for secrets dating back to the era of Jesus Christ to be brought to light...I wasn't sure of Tom Hanks being cast as Langdon at first as he was a decade older than I would have preferred but, as usual, he rose to the occasion, depicting the honourable, quiet and refined nature of the character. Audrey Tautou was equally as good as Neveu, managing the English dialogue without mangling it while also portraying both the character's inner strength and her vulnerability and uncertainties. However, it was Ian McKellen who stole the show as Sir Leigh Teabing, the scholar who has deceptive schoolboy enthusiasm for all things to do with the Holy Grail. McKellen seemed to have had much fun filming, completely throwing himself into the role. Also, highly noteworthy was Paul Bettany, completely unrecognisable as the unhinged albino Silas, and Jean Reno as the single-minded Captain Fache, determined to get his man.Like all film adaptations based on novels, this film isn't quite as good as the original source. The ending in the book was far superior compared with the ends scenes of the film, particularly the Roslin reunion where those who haven't read the book might not be so clear who the caretaker of the chapel was. The romantic tension between Langdon and Neveu in the novel was more of a sibling bond in the film, which did work better considering Hanks was a good decade older than the Langdon of the book while Tautou looked about five years younger than Neveu was depicted. There is nothing worse than seeing an ageing film star passing himself off as a young stud so I'm glad my stomach didn't have to contend with the inklings of a sexual chemistry between Hanks' Langdon and Tautou's Neveu!That said, in many other ways the film was very faithful to the novel and even used imagery to convey points that may have been hard to imagine in the written form, such as how the painting of the Last Supper linked with the theories of the film. It also preserved every piece of evidence, complete with explanation, relating to Langdon and Neveu's quest so one didn't have to have intimate knowledge of mythology or the novel itself to follow the plot.All in all, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a fun detective film with a unique twist, retaining the excitement and thrills that made the novel such a page-turner. Don't allow overly-harsh critics put you off and judge for yourself whether it makes the grade. As for the Vatican's stance on the film, I would have some sympathy for them if they actually put as much effort into hunting down the paedophillic priests in their flock as they do in protesting over a fictional book/film.",7,12,25,22 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A fair first outing for the famous Boy Wizard
","'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' no doubt divided many fans of the 'Harry Potter' novels, of whom I am one. The film adaptation of a much loved book was never going to please everyone and, while it is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, there is no denying that it has both good and bad points.For those who have just flown in from Pluto, the hero of PS is young Harry Potter, a bi-spectacled British boy who has lived with his brutish relatives since he was orphaned at the age of fifteen months. However, on his eleventh birthday, Harry's life changes forever when he discovers his secret legacy...that he is a wizard. He sets off eager to start his First Year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, making friends with fellow First Years, know-all Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, the sixth son of an impoverished but kindly Pureblooded wizarding family. Yet life is not destined to be all fun and games for as our young hero quickly adapts to this wonderful new world, he learns the disturbing truth behind his parents' deaths and that sometimes evil doesn't die easily.The quality of the adult actors was just superb. Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and Julie Walters and Mark Williams as Molly and Arthur Weasley were all destined to play these roles, truly bringing the characters to life in a way I didn't think would be possible. I was less keen on Richard Harris' Dumbledore, feeling he was just a shade too cold and stand-offish to play an paternal man who the neglected Harry came to trust with ease. That said, the adult cast were definitely the backbone of the film, especially in light of the rather mediocre child cast.While Daniel Radcliffe may resemble the living embodiment of Harry Potter, it was evident from his lacklustre performance in PS that he was chosen purely on looks rather than talent. At the best of times, he portrayed Harry as a rather bland and uninspiring hero and, at his lower moments, he was just cringe-worthy (the scene where he discovers he is a wizard is particularly clunky). Devon Murray, who played Seamus, and James and Oliver Phelps, cast as the Weasley twins, were equally as wooden. However, there are a few gems in the group. Tom Felton was excellent in bringing the maliciously mischievousness of Draco Malfoy to life and he is, undoubtedly, the best of the bunch. Emma Watson's Hermione was suitably condescending and obnoxious as the character was aged eleven (sadly, come GoF, Emma didn't comprehend that Hermione had largely out-grown the conceitedness was an integral part of her character in PS). While Tom Felton was the best of the child cast overall, Rupert Grint, who played Ron, was the best of the trio, bringing to the character a quiet loyalty to his friend balanced with the boyish exuberance that was very much apparent to eleven-year-old Ron.The script might be a tad too childish for those over twelve, with not enough focus on the more interesting adult characters, but I believe it suited the mood of the novel given Harry was eleven in PS so viewed the wizarding world in the very innocent, awestruck manner of a child. Director Chris Columbus nicely compliments this by capturing a wondrous, Disney-like feel to Hogwarts in a way that leaves the audience joining Harry in his delight at exploring the magic of the wizarding world. The special effects are acceptable with the exception of the cartoony Quidditch match, which seems to have been lifted straight from the Nintendo video game and awkwardly pasted to the film, and the hideously computerised centaur.PS was a fair adaptation, enjoyable in itself although no-where near the epic of LotR. It does capture the innocence of the characters at a time when they believed the world was neatly divided into good and evil and magic could sort any problem, however, older fans will most likely find the faster, mature pace of the adaptations of the latter novels more suited to their tastes as, in comparison, PS seems to be directed mainly at little fans under twelve.",6,3,5,20 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good though rushed
","Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.I have to say I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag).The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.The film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.I think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned.",6,432,623,18 November 2005
Thor," A brilliant adaptation of the comic book
","I'm someone who is very excited to see 'The Avengers' in 2012 ever since I first heard about the project. Howvever, I have to admit that 'Thor' was always the film I was least looking forward too since Ironman and Cap are my favourites of the team and I also doubted if adapting the Thor comic book was going to end well. Luckily, I was very wrong! 'Thor' sets up the premise that the legends of the Norse gods are, in fact, powerful aliens who inhabit Asgard, one of nine worlds connected to each other through a wormhole system known as the Rainbow Bridge. Thor is a cocky and egotistical prince who is preparing to succeed his father Odin as king, much to his younger brother Loki's quiet resentment. However, when Thor's arrogance leads the race of Ice Giants (who reside on another of the nine worlds) to declare war on Asgard, Odin casts his son out in the hopes of teaching him humility. Thor then finds himself stranded on Earth, powerless and mortal with only scientist Jane Foster and her friends to aid him. Meanwhile, Loki is plotting away with his own plans of leadership.Those who were worried about Chris Hemsworth's role as Thor (considering he is best known in the UK for 'Home and Away!) should relax as he carried the character off perfectly, right from Thor's conceited side to his growing maturity and sense of responsibility. By the end of the film, it is easy to see Hemsworth's Thor take his place as one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Tom Hiddleston, who played Loki, was also another pleasant surprise as he was excellent in depicting the vulnerability of the character as well as his guile, bitterness and jealousy. Natalie Portman was a good Jane Foster, although this was obviously very much Thor's film and it will need a sequel to properly develop Jane as a character. And, as always, it was great to see Clark Gregg as SHIELD agent Coulson, one of the best original characters that the films have produced.I found that the plot was near-perfect for a comic book adaptation, doing well to explain the background of Thor's character and how he evolves to being an Avenger. Loki was also nicely development as a sympathetic antagonist rather than some bland 'black and white' villain. There was a good mix of drama, action and humour and the actual story flowed. You can see how this is nicely coming together with the 'Ironman' films to finally culminate next year to 'The Avengers'.There are some negatives. I did feel Odin could have done with slightly better depiction as he came across as a rather cold father to his sons (it's easy to see why Loki felt he had to take the path he did). Also, there was no need whatsoever for 3D. I've seen the film three times, twice in 2D and once in 3D and felt the latter added absolutely nothing to the film except for making pretty credits at the end. I wish Hollywood would stop with this fad since it's rubbish.I do highly recommend this film to comic book fans as well as anyone looking for a good film. Roll on 'Captain America' in July!",9,1,2,18 June 2011
The Happening," Not brilliant but it is worth a look
","When I first saw the trailer for 'The Happening', I was quite excited at the prospect of another film by M. Night Shyamalan. After all, I enjoyed all his previous films, save 'Lady in the Lake', and was sure he would deliver another breath-taking blockbuster. Sadly, I was wrong and while the film was not a turkey, it was not of the excellence I had expected.The film sees some sort of mysterious ecological event leading to people committing mass suicide, the phenomenon spreading first from large cities then to smaller towns until it is clear a huge chunk of the East Coast is affected. At first, it is assumed to be a terrorist attack but, as more and more people are spontaneously kill themselves, it is clear the cause may be something else entirely...One of the problems with the film was the quality of the acting and the characters themselves. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot, the science teacher who is our main protagonist, and he does flounder in many scenes as if he forgets he's playing an intelligent but ordinary everyday guy, not a gung-ho military hero who is cool in all situations. He could have injected more emotion into his performance. Zooey Deschanel plays Elliot's girlfriend Alma and she too fails to make the audience care for her with the way she depicts the character to be some sort of an escapee from a teeny-booper romance flick. To be fair, it is not entirely Deschanel's fault as Alma is a weak, self-centred character with the emotional capacity of a young adolescent (for example, she puts Elliot and a child at risk a couple of times with her stupid decisions and, at the start, when it's clear people are dying, she is in a huff because Elliot and his friend 'hurt' her feelings).When it comes to the actual storyline, the plot does start off intriguingly and there are many chilling moments when we see people are coolly committing suicide like mindless zombies. However, the finale doesn't deliver what the build-up promised. There are no real explanations or solid end result. In many ways, this film is similar to Shyamalan's previous project 'Signs' both in terms of a mass disaster and no real end resolution to the events but 'Signs' worked better because the characters were more effectively portrayed and their personal storyline was enough of a finale to compensate. This is not the case in 'The Happening' where the storyline fizzles out.Overall, this is by no means a terrible film. It is enjoyable and fits nicely into the apocalyptic genre but 'Signs' has done this sort of idea before and did it better. That said, there was not only moments that had me on the edge of my seat but also lines which were quite humorous. And certainly, it does make one think about the state of the planet in regards to whether humanity does have it coming to them and how we would cope in such an event. It is worth a look, especially in a week when the other premiere is 'The Hulk, a film aimed at keeping twelve-year-olds' entertained.",6,297,535,13 June 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," You're bland, Harry...
","The second in the Harry Potter franchise, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was clearly intended for small children. While this approach did work with 'The Philosopher's Stone' as the happy, Disney -esque atmosphere reflected Harry's idealism of a wizarding world that was perfect, a slightly moody and mature tone would have been far more suitable for CoS since this is when our Boy Who Lived starts to realise the darker side of being a wizard and being a hero. In this film, twelve-year-old Harry is now in his Second Year at Hogwarts when the school is subjected to mysterious attacks that leave Muggleborn students incapacitated. Harry, Ron and Hermione quickly learn a creature is stalking the school, a monster that lives in a secret chamber and was once responsible for the death of a child.The quality of the child acting still leaves much to desired, with Rupert Grint and Tom Felton shining out above their weaker contemporaries. It is left to the adult cast to provide the solid performances, which they do to a marvellous degree. Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Snape seem born to play their roles, bringing their characters to life in a way the child actors just can't do. Kenneth Branagh is a treat as the conceited, campy Lockhart and the scenes where he and Rickman's Snape play each other off are the best in the film. Jason Issacs also deserves a mention since he was deliciously evil as Lucius Malfoy. He and Tom Felton not only look like father and son but in a minute-long scene they were able to portray Draco's hero-worship of his father and Lucius' impatience with his son.The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull, bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him at the barest of evidence, scriptwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus seem intent on making the film a magical version of an Enid Blyton boarding school where kids merrily skip around solving problems. The vain attempts to make the film threatening, such as the overly-long flying car scene (as if anyone thought Harry was going to fall out) and the trudge through the Forbidden Forest, are flat and weak. The final battle between Harry and his unmasked enemy are also lacklustre with no spontaneity and drag on for too long. Character development hasn't improved much either with Ron continuing to be dumbed down for comic relief while we have Hermione getting Ron and Dumbledore's lines (and in the case of the latter, it just sounds odd hearing words of wisdom said by an powerful, elderly wizard in the book being uttered by a child of twelve in the film).CoS also drops a number of points, in my mind, for the crass, cheesy overly-sentimentality of the ending. Steve Kloves must have been in Hollywood saccharine mode when he thought that pupils in British high schools would honestly clap for teachers (especially ones who have done nothing to warrant such praise) and kids hugging teachers in front of everyone. Harry would have been beaten up and bullied for being a boy of twelve who cuddles into his teacher like a wimpy little girl. And the preceding scene where Lucius confronts Harry was also cavity-inducing with the modest hero of the novels coming across as an arrogant, smug little brat. Kloves not only needs to re-read the book but he should spend more time with real kids at high school if this is how he thinks they conduct themselves.While CoS was enjoyable enough, it was still a mediocre take of the novel. It was evident that it was produced to keep little kids happy rather than a love for the series or to please the actual fans. I did like it but I still feel so envious of the LotR fans who get an epic film trilogy that matches up to the excellence of books and I wonder if HP will ever be that great.",5,23,44,2 April 2006
War of the Worlds," Rubbish ending ruined it all
","As someone who was certain this adaptation would be ruined by Hollywood's need to show how being American and patriotic can give you the power to save the world from anything, I was very pleasantly surprised that this latest Americanised version 'War of the Worlds' was quite faithful to the themes of the book. It was 'War of the Worlds' in the twenty-first century instead of 'Independence Day' Take Two.As everyone knows, this story is of highly advanced aliens invading Earth and terraforming it for their own purposes while systematically annihilating the human race. However, like the book, there is no computer genius with the answer to save us or some secret government group who have a weapon to destroy the invaders. Humans are seen as little more than pathetic insects to the aliens and are being squashed just as easily as one would a spider. The film specifically focuses on the immature Ray Ferrier-- played by Tom Cruise-- and his two estranged children, sixteen-year-old Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and ten-year-old Rachel (Dakota Fanning).The film retains the ideology of the book that humans as not as powerful as we like to think while playing on the fears of terrorism that dominate our world today. And one of the strong points of 'War of the Worlds' is that Ferrier family are not perfect nor do they have special gifts and powers that will give them an advantage as they flee the aliens. Ray is an average guy who can barely look after himself let alone his kids, Robbie is the angry teen who thinks he knows more than his father while Rachel is just a typical ten-year-old kid who wants her mother (a few people were irritated by Dakota Fanning's screams of terror but I found it refreshing to see a kid in a disaster film actually show their fear and vulnerability rather than taking it all into their stride with the ease of a military professional). Since this is a Spielberg film, the visual effects were as excellent as one would expect from him. Seeing the tripods emerge from the ground then blast everything, from buildings to people, apart in seconds was thrilling in a frightening manner and the scenes where the planet ravaged by the red weed were eerily disturbing (all that was missing was Jeff Wayne's 'The Red Weed' music).So, why did I only give this film a five? Well, quite frankly, the atrocious ending just destroyed all that the previous hour-and-a-half had accomplished and I'm not talking about the way in which the aliens are killed since that was HG Wells' idea long, long before 'Independence Day' ever graced our screens. No, what utterly disappointed me was Spielberg indulging in his perpetual need to come over all sentimental and sweet. It was bad enough that are we expected to believe the arrogant and self-absorbed Robbie, who demanded to be left behind at a battle scene because he 'needed' to watch, was able to find his way unscathed to his mother's house despite the fact he probably isn't even capable of walking home from school alone. The character of Robbie just took the whole idea of adolescent rebellion too far with the way his tantrums continued despite the fact the humanity was on the brink of extinction, something that would surely mature even the most brattiest of teenagers. However, what was even worse was when Ray and Rachel finally arrive in Boston to an intact Robbie, we are shown a row of perfectly preserved homes, totally untouched by the invasion. The children's mother, step-father and step-grandparents then all emerge from the house all clean and well-dressed as if they had been hosting a tea party. Rather than maintaining the message that we can be picked off at any moment that the film had been depicting, this cavity-inducing ending just gives the idea that if you want to live in a crisis, behave like spoilt, snotty brat and everything will be fine or, better still, go to suburban Boston since they seem to have some sort of shield protecting them.We may laugh at 'Independence Day' for it's improbable plot but at least it knew it was a blockbuster and didn't try to be more so instead just focused on entertaining us. With 'War of the Worlds', Spielberg might like to think he has given us an intelligent film that portrays the realism of war and invasion but he ruined all he had achieved in the final ten minutes. What could have been a powerful film, if Robbie had died or suffered, turned out to be just another less-than-average summer flick.",5,3,4,19 February 2006
Iron Man," Excellent comic book adaptation- others could learn from it
","'Iron Man' has to be up there as one of the best comic book film adaptations and is certainly one of the most enjoyable films of the year so far. The film, based upon the Marvel comic, centres on billionaire Tony Stark, who has continued with his father's successful weaponry business. However, when a trip to Afghanistan to sell missiles to the US military ends with Stark being held as a prisoner of war, he begins to see the darker side to his work and resolves to change his ways by using his technology and intelligence to do good. And the first step to doing so is for Stark to become Iron Man...Robert Downey Junior is not exactly a big named actor but he easily steps into the role of Tony Stark, the spoilt playboy, and Iron Man, the hero Stark strives to be. Perhaps his own personal issues helped mould Downey to play a role of a man who realises he has to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions but, whatever the case, he definitely brought strength to the character, walking the careful line between delivering jokes and sustaining the serious nature to the film. He was well-supported by a wonderfully evil Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard as the loyal best friend who perhaps will play a larger role in any future sequel and Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's personal assistant who keeps him grounded. Shaun Toub also made his presence felt as the short-time mentor who sets Stark onto his path of heroism.When it comes to the visual effects, 'Iron Man' had it nailed. The action scenes were breath-taking without compromising on the script (since there is nothing worse than a film with excellent CGI and rubbish storyline). As it should be, the plot was what made this film so successful. Unlike other adaptations, specifically 'X-Men', this film never pandered to kids and maintained a more mature storyline and development of the characters. Stark wasn't turned into a twelve-year-old, there were no wee moppets popping up to appeal to children nor was the villain of the piece some two-bit, two-dimensional terrorist.This is an excellent film that should appeal to those who love action flicks as well as comic books/sci-fi. Here's looking to a sequel being released some point in the near future because it is certainly a franchise Marvel should expand upon.",10,1,3,7 May 2008
Casino Royale," A worthy addition to the Bond collection
","After months of anticipation, 'Casino Royale' was revealed to be, at least for me, a rather enjoyable thriller. Perhaps it wasn't the best Bond but it was a worthy addition to the collection.Based upon the first of Ian Flemming's novels, 'Casino Royale' sees Bond newly promoted to '00' status meaning he now has a license to kill and this is a license he intends to put to very good use. His assignment as 007 first leads him to a terrorist cell then to LeChiffre, who is raising his funds in a high-powered poker game that he can't afford to lose.This was a darker, more aggressive Bond and Daniel Craig definitely captured that essence to the character, a man who's not afraid to kill or to put his life on the line because he's still young enough not to care. This Bond was also more human in that he can feel pain and can be injured even if he does endured it all with military prowess. I did feel Craig was a shade too old for the role, however, as the arrogance and ego of this younger Bond would have suited a man who looked no older than his mid-thirties and was still relishing the novelty of his new '00' status. He might be in his late thirties but he looks a good decade older. That said, now this 'origins' storyline is over, I think he will be better suited as an older, veteran Bond in subsequent films (although had they cast a younger Bond, he would have been able to do more films than Craig is surely destined to do). Judi Dench was excellent as always though as she reprised her role as the cool, self-assured 'M' but this time it seemed fitting there was almost a touch of concern in her tone towards Bond, who is meant to be still quite fresh-faced in his duties.The actual plot-line was very involving, shifting between multiple villains in the tradition of the novel. I imagine some folk might find the poker scenes a bit tiring, especially if they are unfamiliar with the game, but the action and fight scenes more than make up for that as Bond proves that he didn't spend his training days learning how to sip martinis and wear a tux. The violence is raw and all necessary in comparison with other action films where it's added because it looks good or will make a nice scene in the video game. Also, the whole set up of M16 reflects on a post September 11th era where intelligence services are both under pressure to produce results and under surveillance by the press to ensure they don't abuse their powers and this works well to compliment the moodier tone of the film and Bond.Yet there were a number of flaws I found with 'Casino Royale'. The first was the length; a good twenty minutes towards the end could have been shaved down. Secondly, the villains, including LeChiffre, lacked substance. Not enough effort was made to give them personality and make them more three-dimensional. The result was, it was hard to care one way or the other what happened to them compared with other villains in previous Bond films that either left the audience admiring their audacity or eager to see them die. Also, Vesper-- the Bond girl-- was a another character who lacked depth and it was hard to understand how Bond suddenly fell for her when there was little chemistry between them nor were there any scenes to suggest they felt a romantic connection. Product placement of Sony and Ford was a major annoyance in the film to the point where I've been put off both after being overly-advertised to. It just cheapened the film seeing Sony products being shown off right, left and centre. That, and a better song could have been chosen for accompanying the title credits, especially since a film where a new actor is debuting as Bond deserves something more memorable.Personally, Craig isn't the best Bond nor was this the best Bond film but 'Casino Royale' surpassed my expectations and I'm sure other Bond fans who doubted him will probably find him, at the very least, acceptable in the role and will be willing to give him a chance in another film. It will be interesting to see how he depicts the character shifting from headstrong, aggressiveness to collected maturity (yet still deadly) as Bond gains more experience. One last thing, this film was rated a 12A but, parents, do think twice about bringing your younger, more sensitive children as there are some scenes which can be quite brutal.",7,2,5,16 November 2006
Fantastic Four," No-where near as bad as critics claim
","You needn't bother with 'Fantastic Four' if you're expecting a superhero film with a dark edge, such as 'V for Vendetta' or 'Batman Begins'. This film aims to be much more of a light-hearted action flick complete with all-American heroes who have little time for brooding in the shadows. And that doesn't mean it is a bad film because, while I am a huge fan of 'Batman Begins' and the latest Spider-Man releases, there is something to be said watching a more traditional take on superheroes who are boisterous and gung-ho, and the lines between good and evil are very clear-cut. To be quite honest, this film is meant to be a fun popcorn flick and doesn't pretend to be anything else.Based on one of the lesser known Marvel comics, 'Fantastic Four' revolves around a group of four-- scientist Reed Richards, his girlfriend Sue Storm, her younger military brother Johnny and Reed's strapping best friend Ben Grimm-- who are exposed to cosmic rays during an experimental mission in space. The radiation from the rays alters them on the genetic level, bestowing them with super powers. However, unbeknown to them, insidious businessman Victor Von Doom was also altered too and he intends to use his powers to conquer the world and it is up to our heroes to put a stop to his plan.The story is solid enough with the intention of providing simple entertainment that doesn't require much abstract thought from the audience. The heroes are all likable, all-round decent people with the cocky Johnny providing the witty one-liners and the Reed/Sue/Doom love triangle leaving you cheering on the naive but nice Reed. The actors make an effort to fit their roles (Michael Chiklis was definitely born to play Ben/The Thing) and clearly have a good time doing so.'Fantastic Four' is a film that drives to the heart of what superhero comic books are about; the good guys being good and trumping the detestable, arrogant bad guys. It's fun, bright and action-packed and is certainly a better effort than other comic book adaptations such 'The Hulk' or 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. Although I hope any sequel takes a slightly darker edge, don't let critics' disparaging reviews put you off this as it is very entertaining.",7,0,1,8 May 2006
V for Vendetta," Very powerful even if it makes Thatcherism look heavenly!
","'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up.",10,385,523,28 March 2006
