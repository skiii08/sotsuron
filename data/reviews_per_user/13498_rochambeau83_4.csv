Antz," Incredible use of various Dimensions and Levels in a film.
","I found this film to work on a ton of levels.  The first level is that of a classic story with a lovable, but neurotic nerd that finds some source of courage in a series of freak events. It also contains a similar classic love story of the underdog getting the girl that is completely out of his league. However what most impresses me is the story line of complex politics that exsist in modern society.  The ant hill that they lived in basically worked as a socialistic society.  Each ant was born into a class and they were never to stray from that class and they were always to do their work without question.  Then you have a high ranking officer trying to increase his power through military force. I just love the parallels this film has to the politics of the U.S.S.R. in its hayday. It does in fact require a great amount of thought and is definately not for little kids.",Null,0,0,10 June 2003
Requiem for a Dream," An unforgettable Experience
","I saw RFAD for the first time in May of 2002.  I approached it from an element of complete ignorance.  I knew nothing of the film, only what I read on the back cover and that didn't help me very much, but I heard enough it's name plenty of times so I decided to give it a looksey.  When the credits started to roll I had a deep feeling of sorrow in the pit of my stomach. It left an incredible impact on me and I just had to see it again.  I was stunned at the complexity of the characters and the multiple themes one could find in here.  There are emotions in this film that everyone can relate to.  It is not just a film about junkies and how they mess up their lives with drugs.  It is about what drives the people into those drugs. It is about loneliness, and most importantly it is about how everything can become your drug of choice, from candy to television to daydreaming anything in your life that you cannot seem to live without is your drug of choice.More than that it is the way one finds these characters to be at the end.  Many people will point out certain elements that are not true to real life.  They say that the doctor didn't play a doctor correctly, but do you know why? It is because he isn't a doctor.  I've never heard people complain that the gangsters in The Godfather or Goodfellas weren't realistic enough. Some people choose to hate films for two reasons, number one, they don't understand it or number 2 they want to feel special by being different.",10,0,0,17 February 2003
Insomnia," A Well made film that was the victim of poor marketing.
","I think this is a brilliant film.  There is a constant moral struggle going on involving the classic Rhetorical question, 'Do the ends justify the means?'  This question is pondered by all the characters in the film, but non-more so than Will Dormer(Pacino).  He is forced into working with Walter FInch(Williams) because he knows something.  He knows that if the information gets out about the killing that his credibility is lost so he eventually gets lost in a never ending spiral that leads to the tragic conclusion.The complaint most people have is that this was marketed as an edge of your seat thriller so that is what they were expecting and when it wasn't delivered they felt betrayed like the film itself let them down.  Mainly because the majority of the film is Dormer going through a process of personal contemplation.  Though I understand why most people would complain about this film they don't want to watch a film that provokes thought on personal ethics and moral ambiguity they would rather sit back and watch Tobey Maguire look cool climbing walls and shooting webbing out of his wrists, but oh well. As H.L. Mankin(I think that's how his name is spelled) once said, 'Noone ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.'",Null,0,0,26 February 2003
Black Hawk Down," Highly Overated Spectacle Driven Drivel
","Quite a long time ago on opening weekend my friend and I went to see this film.  We both had High Expectations of it hearing so many great things.  However when the credits started rolling we both had major problems with this film.  Problems that could not have been fixed by simple time spent in the editing room. One review I have read declared this film amongst the pinacle of other great films such as Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, and Saving Private Ryan (He forgot Three Kings, Platoon, and The Deer Hunter but Oh well.) back to my point the difference those films have that this film is lacking are the two most important aspects of story telling.(Film making at its core is storytelling remember.) Plot and Character Development.  Black Hawk down is missing both of those. It has a little bit of Conflict Exposition, then just crashes into an hour and a half battle scene.  Believe me I enjoy battle scenes as much as the next film buff.  The invasion of Normandy in Saving Private Ryan took my breath away.  But when it just carries on to make up the bulk of the film as this does there is no way someone can follow a story because there is no story line to follow.  There is a guy that gets captured and that went no where.  There are people just running and shooting a the Somalians with loud gun fire covering over any possible dialogue making none of the characters worth remembering.  It basically has the plot and thematic equivalent of a Steven Segal movie and that is far from a complement.Many people talk about how realistic it is, but film making is not realism, it is supposed to be heightened realism, and you should be left with something more than just an visual memory of a guy holding a wound shut as blood spills on the floor.  This did not deliver.  Like most of Scott's other Indeavors he just does not have what it takes to be a distinguished director.  Though I guess his movies can be pretty fun to watch at times.",Null,3,6,31 January 2003
