The Blair Witch Project," Points for originality, but nothing else.
","The Blair Witch Project may be a cult classic for years, just like Rocky Horror Picture Show, and others of that nature. However, it will never be more than it was - a gigantic hoax on the movie-going public.Blair Witch did some interesting things - the use of method acting to the extreme, where the actors were issued secret instructions and forced to go without food and sleep, etc. Creative and 'real' as it is however, the film falls flat on its face. Heather is shrill and annoying throughout... her 'method' acting reminiscent of a bad introductory college acting course. Thus, the psychological horror that the film is going for never quite hits the target. The 'seasick' inducing camera shots don't help, either. Additionally, when the actors get stuck as to what they should be doing, they solve the conundrum by screaming at each other and having a 'dramatic fight scene.' Too little substance. Points for originality, but ultimately falls short. A forgettable one-hit hoax!",2,0,2,12 August 1999
Gran Torino," Good, but not Great
","Clint Eastwood delivers a masterful performance as Korean War veteran Walt Kowalski. Subtle and thought-provoking, Eastwood deserves critical raves for yet another demonstration of his creative prowess.Other than that, the performances of the other actors, especially those playing Sue, Thao, and just about every gang member in the film, are absolutely horrendous. Sometimes actors fall into the trap of 'just reading lines' - the result is a stilted, wooden delivery that makes it sound like they are reading from a page in the script instead of internalizing and then emoting.Gran Torino is a good film, but it is uneven and doesn't pack the same wallop as it should. It is not a Top 100 caliber film by any stretch, and I would venture to say that time will not be kind to it in terms of distinguishing it from the pack.",7,1,4,31 January 2011
Taken," Mixed Messages
","From beginning to end, this film packs an amazing adrenaline rush - that much is certain. Perhaps it is the straightforward, nearly nonstop Liam Neeson-as-Steven Seagal action that is buoying the movie's reputation as it enters the rental phase of its life, or the legitimately serious topic of child exploitation / the worldwide child/young adult sex trade, but despite these strengths, the film also causes me to pause and consider its even more distressing qualities - plot holes and inconsistencies, ethnic stereotypes, and the exchanging of one inexcusable violence for another.Plot Holes: Almost too numerous to mention. Take your pick. Why break into a 5th floor apartment in the middle of the day, carrying two young girls out kicking and screaming when you can pick them up for a 'party' later, isolate them somewhere in the city, and then kidnap them? How does a man with an Irish/American brogue pass as a French police officer without speaking a word of French? Why does Neeson say he 'was a traitor, not a villain' (or whatever he says on the rooftop) - was there any other explanation of this? I can do willing suspension of disbelief. Really. I know that it's meant to be mindless entertainment... but Rambo Does Paris? It's too much to be a film of any serious importance.Ethnic Stereotypes: This was particularly bad - spoiled, ignorant Americans safe in their virginal land of California until they discover the dangers that lurk across the ocean in a 'foreign' land... the French cutting deals with crudely stereotyped Albanians and Muslims (the 'Paris always surrenders' myth) while the righteous Americans have to step in and kick tail... and on down the line. Worse still was the death of the traveling companion (because she has sex with boys) and the salvation of the daughter (spared long enough to be saved because she was pure and thus more valuable) - while this may be a dirty truth of the human slave trade, it still sends an unmistakably puritanical message to audiences.Violence: Violence against women - especially sexual violence - is abhorrent. That being said, vigilantism, torture, and murder are no panacea for what ails human society. If everyone pulled a Liam Neeson, there would be anarchy.A 7 or 8 out of 10 means that you want people to take a film seriously. This film, while interesting in some respects, adrenaline-pumping and exciting throughout, merits no more than a 5 or a 6 for those qualities. It is meant to be eye candy and a good mindless summer rental. It is NOT a serious film that will have a lasting impact upon cinema.Perhaps the most disturbing thing to me as a member of the critically thinking (?) public is that lately we have been eating these sorts of movies up like it's our job - and then assigning critical kudos where none are deserved. Whether it's 'Wanted' or 'Taken', we are mistaking mindless action (which has its place at times) for Oscar-worthy material. I hope that we come to our senses soon and learn to keep the two in their separate spheres of influence.A good summer rental. Nothing more. And please, I beg you, critically analyze the mixed messages of the film. I think you'll begin to see how many a moviegoer may have been 'Taken' at the box office.",5,63,109,30 June 2009
