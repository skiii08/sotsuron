Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It Doesn't get any better then This.
","'Whoa' that was what I thought, after I had finished watching Kill Bill Vol 2. I almost Cried at the end of this movie seriously, at the fact that I, had just witnessed the greatest Revenge story every told.  Tarantino is the Greatest Director of all time. He knows how to play with the audience emotions, seeing as how he is a fan of all movies himself. Uma(The Bride), Caradine(Bill), Madsen(Budd), Hannah(Elle), Liu(Pai Mei), Parks(the old guy in the mexican whore house)and the brides daughter(very suhweet), has to be the perfect cast ever in a movie. Kill Bill vol 1 was one of my favorite movies of 2003. Yes i Liked Kill Bill vol 1 even more then i liked the last two Matrix Movies and i'm a HUGE Matrix Fan. and Kill Bill vol 2 is so far my favorite movie of 2004 far, and might be my favorite movie of 2004 seeing as there really isn't any other movie i'm looking forward to seeing this year.  Thank you Quentin and Uma for giving me and the world the greatest Revenge movie and possibly greatest movie ever.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
