Insidious: Chapter 2," Not at all recommended.
","I am a big fan of horror movies especially ones that have a good story and have a couple of genuine horrifying and startling scenes. Insidious is one of those movies. I was very excited when I first saw the trailer of chapter 2 and instantly made up my mind to watch it in the theater. However I was extremely disappointed with the movie. There was not a single scene in the movie that made me jump and the story was completely ridiculous making no sense at all. The direction and acting also seemed to be below par as compared to chapter one. The little comedy that they added only further annoyed me. Overall the movie was way below my expectations and after watching it, it was clear why there were only about fifteen people in the cinema hall. Money and time wasted.",4,23,44,17 September 2013
