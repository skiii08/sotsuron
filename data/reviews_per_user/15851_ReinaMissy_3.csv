The Lobster," A Sad Commentary on Societal Expectations
","As quirky as it is, this film is a strong commentary not only on the rigid ideas human society places on its relationships, but also on the shallow expectations we have of each other. David is willing to lie in order to fit in, then once he does 'fit in' (in the wrong place) he has to lie again in order to be accepted. Apparently it never occurs to him to ask questions or to try to be authentic. It's more important in this film to fit into what the establishment dictates.The pace of the film is a bit disjointed, which can cause a disconnect. While the dry humor often hits its mark, sometimes the viewer can find himself getting the joke about three minutes later. The reviews I've seen from many people who claim this movie is 'slow' and 'boring' frustrate me. I might expect that from Joe Movie Goer, but not from a professional reviewer. Too many of them have forgotten that film is an art form, one that is not built on instant gratification. If the latter is what you're seeking, go find a chick flick. For a movie that makes you think, The Lobster is a good choice.",7,1,3,3 June 2016
Dunkirk," Enormous Disappointment
","I have been a fan of Christopher Nolan since I saw 'Memento', and Cillian Murphy is good in everything he does, so I was really looking forward to this film. What an enormous disappointment.I have to wonder why film critics are doing an ecstatic dance over it; being Christopher Nolan does not give you an automatic pass to having your film considered great. This is the worst movie I've seen in quite a while, regardless of director.What the film presents is about a half dozen sub stories but with no simultaneous time frame; it hops from one scene to the next with no continuity. Nowhere are we able to make an emotional connection with the characters, which is really the key to a fine film. It was simply a collage of well acted scenes about war thrown together into one huge mess. Maybe Nolan felt he was unable to due justice to those who so courageously stood at Dunkirk without bringing in sub stories. He should have found a better film editor to attempt to tie it all together.",4,12,19,29 July 2017
High Fidelity," High Fidelity Is A Great Film
","'High Fidelity' was not only fine entertainment, its soundtrack is one of the best in the past two decades.I can accept that someone might not like this film - although why anyone would consider the role of Rob Gordon as not suited to John Cusack is beyond my comprehension - but this soundtrack is one of the finest ever to score a movie.Period.This film gets 9 stars out of 10 for its entertainment value; the soundtrack gets 12 stars out of ten.",9,0,1,6 August 2001
