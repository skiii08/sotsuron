The Mask," P.A.R.T.Y. coz ya gotta!
","This is a great movie that does exactly what it should, makes you laugh. Heck, even my Mum & Dad enjoyed this one. It's got something for everyone. I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey, he's an entertainer, pure & simple. The film as a whole stands the test of time, the SFX still enhance the film even if it is nearly 10 years old now! Also, the moment where Cameron Diaz makes her entry is Cinema gold! She looks gorgeous! See this movie today!",9,0,0,24 February 2003
Just Go with It," Sandler on Form!
","Just finished watching this one and I can honestly say (despite all the lies in the movie!!) that I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in ages. I was laughing out loud on several occasions! Not since 'The Hangover' have I laughed out loud so much. Some cracking moments. Yes, of course the storyline is nuts, but when it's written and acted so well, who cares! Sandler was at his best ('Wedding Singer' standard) and Jennifer Aniston was wonderful! The rest of the cast all played their parts well too, but it's the scenes between Sandler & Aniston that I enjoyed the most. A most enjoyable movie that I'm sure I will return to again sometime, without hesitation!!",9,2,3,10 March 2012
