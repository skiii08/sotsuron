Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas is rusty and it shows
","The Phantom Menace was sorry.  George Lucas has shown no growth as a filmmaker over the last twenty years but has increased his dependence on special effects to hide a lack of storytelling ability.  The Phantom Menace has poorly developed characters, no direction to its weak story and plenty of ethnic stereotypes.  One would think a veteran director in the 90s would be able to avoid such an ignorant crutch.  The movie gets off to a horrible start when we witness his supposedly japanese trade federation officers embarrass anyone in the theater with any racial sensitivity for about twenty minutes.  The Phantom Menace wasn't a letdown but it leaves a lot to be desired.  Nothing can be expected from Lucas who can't take his work in a different direction and seems to be satisfied by gaining money instead of respect.",5,0,1,1 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Thought with our entertainment
","This film has proven to be the best satire of the year.  NO punches are pulled and thank god they didn't.  Parker and Stone make fun of everything and everybody but give us a film that's a carnival mirror of ourselves. They attack the issues that are sweeping through our political arena with brutal (hilarious) honesty- even if it is with our favorite cartoon team since the Thundercats.  Irony and laughter, a thinking person's picture.",9,0,0,5 July 1999
The Matrix," A film that excels on many levels.
","The Matrix is a film that provides quality entertainment for the time and money invested by the viewer.  It is the first live action to capture the essence of Japanese anime.  It also has transcendental themes that really made it entertaining for me.  This is a step forward for the fantasy/sci-fi genre.  The action is Woo-ish and the effects are tight.  Best of all, the movie provokes thought and that is one of the best things a film can do.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
