Requiem for a Dream," A moive that only Darren A. could pull off
",It was a good movie that made you think of the story. No way was it given to you on a silver platter. It makes you think and you become one with the world of the Goldfarbs. Not only was the story great it was very visually stimulating. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE,10,0,1,16 December 2001
