"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Funny but follows an obvious formula
",1. Man leaves Woman 2. Man wants Woman back 3. Woman becomes engaged to a seemingly perfect Man. 4. Man attempts to prove his love for Woman/that he has changed 5. Seemingly perfect man screws up in a big way 6. Woman falls in love with Man again 7. Happy Ending. The formula here should be obvious to anyone who watches movies. The movie is not fall of your chair laughing funny but funny enough to keep you entertained and deserves a watch.Harish Patel is very funny as both an angry Indian man and as inspiration to Simon Pegg to keep running. His daughter played by India de Beaufort was very attractive and I am hoping she is not a one dimensional actress.,7,6,9,24 March 2008
Divergent," Probably not for adults of either gender.
","First I want to say I have no problem with a female protagonist, there have been quite a few movies like that lately and I have watched and enjoyed several. I do though notice how willingly the book/movie writers deviate from strong women characters to 'isn't it great to have a boyfriend' characters. I assume this is for the younger audience who haven't had their idealism beaten down by the actual dating world. So lets get to the good and bad points of this movie:<ul><li>The relationship pacing in this movie was good. </li></ul><ul><li>The faction idea is awful, people in factions grow to distrust other factions, its human nature (think of how countries distrust each other, religions and even different high schools in the same city or cliques in the same high school).</li></ul><ul><li>The idea of the factionless is awful, so now you have a group your are actively oppressing, yup that wont cause problems.</li></ul><ul><li>So they don't allow divergence but they don't check for it until you are a certain age and then they just kill you? And no one seems to have a problem with that?</li></ul><ul><li>Dauntless are taught to be brave though taking huge risks and possibly suffering death and are constantly chastised for either being a coward or too reckless, which one is it? Think of the knife throwing scene or the zip line scene or the initial jump into darkness.</li></ul><ul><li>Reckless soldiers are bad soldiers, think of the armed forces in your country, they are nothing like these guys yet they are tasked with the same job.</li></ul><ul><li>They seem to have a few types of guns, most of them silly looking but they don't have any other type of weapons which I thought was odd.</li></ul><ul><li>I assume the factionless can have children, can they join a faction? If not then they are going to start multiplying. The dauntless are going to really cause a problem here by throwing out semi trained young men and women who can reproduce and have military training.</li></ul><ul><li>Why does that train seem to be wherever they need it to be? and does anyone else besides Dauntless ride it?</li></ul><ul><li>'Why does everyone keep saying that to me?' BANG! I laughed at that.</li></ul><ul><li>Chances are that people in different factions are going to fall in love with each other, they seem to be in close proximity enough for that to happen, how is that dealt with? What if a baby comes of that?</li></ul><ul><li>Mind control drug works on the soldiers for hours yet works on the old lady for like 5 minutes just so they can have a scene where she realizes what she has done. Also who wouldn't have backups?</li></ul><ul><li>I might have missed this but where are your skilled labourers falling under? Like your electricians or computer engineers etc. </li></ul><ul><li>What purpose is there for having all that mind control drug in the control center?</li></ul><ul><li>Son meets father that beat him which results in half a second of awkwardness then its over.</li></ul><ul><li>Tris wants to take it slow which I think is a good message for younger women, I didn't realize from the movie alone that this was only because she has intimacy problems.</li></ul><ul><li>Faction over blood: NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN, can you imagine siding with the people you picked carrots with over your family?</li></ul><ul><li>Four turns down a promotion to leadership twice but appears to have the same job as Eric in leadership any ways.</li></ul><ul><li>There is a relationship between Tris and the Old lady where she seems to think that Tris is special, Tris does get a lot more attention than anyone else does from this woman yet that comes to nothing. </li></ul>Seriously I could go on and on and on but these things killed my ability to suspend disbelief like I was able to do for Hunger games, and when you cant suspend disbelief those two and a half hours that this movie is really really drags on (sort of like this review).",4,12,21,23 March 2014
Prometheus," Much like my last relationship this was disappointing
","I wanted this to be good, I wanted it so badly to be good it I was willing to write off science things that didn't make sense. Now don't get me wrong this movie wasn't terrible, I enjoyed many aspects of the story, the visuals were great and I was curious as to whom the engineers were. The problem is that there were many things I couldn't ignore that kept happening through the movie. 1. The scientists were more dumb than the audience. <ul><li>Getting scared and getting lost even though you have the map. - Going on a long trip without even knowing why they are going. - Taking your helmet off just because the air is breathable. - Trying to play with what appears to be an albino space cobra. (Listen if it looked like a cute little bunny I would understand the mistake). </li></ul>And on and on and on...2. The story stopped making sense at its convenience. <ul><li>Lets not keep an eye on the staff we have trapped in the alien structure. - Lets experiment on someone in the ship rather than going back to Earth and figuring out what the alien substance is. - Oh Peter Weyland is on the ship, why is that kept secret? - No one is shocked to see the bleeding woman in the ship? - Why did the Engineers send us maps to their biological weapons facility? We can presume at that point they liked us. </li></ul>and on and on and on and on. To sum up Prometheus: Its like when you watch a horror movie and someone runs up the stairs to get away from the monster, suddenly I don't care if the idiot lives anymore, I may even be cheering for the monster at that point. When people act in a way that you do not think is reasonable the movie loses its tension, its emotional connection, and the immersion. This is what Prometheus does for me, a bunch of idiots on a starship meet an idiot from another planet and together do idiotic things until credits.",3,12,17,16 October 2013
Annihilation," This movie is like an onion with its many layers to peel...
","...only to find there are just more layers of onion.Annihilation is a film that presents a reality and never explains it, the onus is on you to work out what it all means. For many people this will be an enjoyable and challenging experience, and others will feel like they just sat in on a 2 hour Biology and Psychology lecture.The Movie Annihilation follows former military soldier and current scientist Lena (played by Natalie Portman), and four other throw away characters of various backgrounds. The group ventures into the shimmer to gather data and determine a way to stop it. As the movie progresses an adventure of scientific proportions develops that provide information and additional questions to both the characters and the viewers. The adventure climaxes to an ultimately satisfying scientific but not exciting ending. I left the theater satisfied but a little disappointed, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the little hints of information that kept me thinking through the movie. What I didn't enjoy was that some of the fundamentals were missing. We had supporting characters we knew so little about that when they died or moved on we didn't care. 
Mutation happening mostly in the form of adding flowers to walls and antlers and skin etc. 
Too many flashbacks (sometimes the same one as before only longer).
The movie cannot decide if it wants the atmosphere to be about wonder or tension and flip flops between the two over 2 hours. 
Too hard to believe they had been working to discover the shimmers secrets for years and had literally zero information about it, other than it was increasing in size. Really no one thought to maybe stick their arm in and take a scoop of dirt?In the end I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to someone looking for a little bit of a thinker. Was it a deep movie? The self appointed movie intellectuals on IMDB sure think it is.",7,2,5,24 February 2018
