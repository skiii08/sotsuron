Breaking into buckingham, wh and American natives' holy palace, what's next, blowing up eiffel tower, great wall or the big ben?I've watched so many foreign films from Netflix and always found much more respects from foreign film producers, simply by minding their own business.Hollywood: people from outside Hollywood are not stupid at all, at least they figure that out, but you don't!",3,5,7,7 June 2008
Billy Elliot," ~Go Billy! ~Go Everybody!
","~Every school in the world shall play this film in class! My husband & I just watched this film with tears & both our hearts with this fine lad's future every minute!~Everyone is Billy Elliot! :)How many of our dreams, ambitions, interests, thoughts about who we truly are & life have been discouraged by our family background, family members, school system, teachers, peers, society.......!? It took me years to recognize that my 'caring' mother was the one who smothered my dreams and eventually got the courage to say 'NO' to her! In the front part of film, I resented the brother and father so much.But at the end, their lives begin to change to be better simply by opening their hearts! :)Billy is very fortunate to have someone to have recognized his talent!He is born to be a super star, a great inspiration to so many in the world! His dancing always tells people: 'Never Stop To Dream!'~Go Billy!~Go Everybody!",10,0,0,20 August 2011
