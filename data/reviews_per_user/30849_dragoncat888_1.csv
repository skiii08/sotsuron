Blade Runner 2049," The best remade - BR 2049
","I saw BR 2019 in the 1980's, it left me feeling awe in a good way. Now I saw BR 2049, it left me feeling the same. Except, more profound. The lighting sets me in moods that is hard to describe. The settings are stunning. Seeing Deckard and Officer K together is priceless. The Replicants are no longer just Nexus 6 and the newer models are so much humanoid!.... I can't wait for the Sequel.",10,2,9,25 October 2017
