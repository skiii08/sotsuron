The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Mystique: Fiction Well Done
","Such a mystique surrounds 'The Blair Witch Project.'  I don't know why so many people are so hung up on the movie being 'real.'  So what if it's fiction?  It's well-done fiction.  It didn't take away from 'The Fly' for me to know that giant mutant flies don't really exist ... nor did it take away from 'The Howling' to know that werewolves don't exist.  Why all the squawking about this being truth rather than fiction?I think the fact that it's filmed with relatively primitive equipment, and in a 'realistic' manner, contributes to some people's refusal to believe it's fabrication.  Also, while the Internet has hyped many a movie, 'Blair Witch' makes more extensive use of this medium (and adds the 'Curse of the Blair Witch' special on Sci-Fi.)  So some of the more gullible of us, thinking anything we read or see on TV must be true, believe it.I personally think it's somewhat frightening that we confuse the carefully done websites and the Sci-Fi special -- which dispense mythology specifically created to heighten the Blair Witch experience -- with factual news reporting.  Get a grip, people.  The websites and the special are absolutely BRILLIANT from the standpoint of adding to the feeling of realism surrounding the movie.Let's just recognize 'The Blair Witch Project' for the groundbreaking, interesting, and scary movie it is.  That's sure enough for me!",9,1,2,26 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," The Witching Hour (well, 87 minutes)
","I used to review books and movies professionally, so I hope my comments will add a few fresh perspectives.  First, let me say that it's obvious that this is not the kind of movie that everyone will like.  People biased against seeing horror films won't; people who want technical perfection in the filmmaking process won't; people who want an airtight and tightly wound plot won't.  And I agree that the film has its problems - lots of gratuitous profanity, a tendency to drag about two-thirds through, and some plot points that aren't entirely clear.  For example, I didn't tie in how some of the residents' brief comments in the beginning affected the movie's ending (and various other events).  But they do impact it.  Maybe I just need to be hit over the head, but I didn't get it the first time around.All that said:  I love `The Blair Witch Project.'  Took me two viewings to really appreciate it.  The first time, I found it fascinating  and the second time, I found it scary, especially when I `got' the ending. Scariest movie ever?  No.  But for a combination of scary and interestingly done, it scores big points.Unlike some reviewers, I found the acting very realistic.  Some of the negative reviews I've read cite problems:  The actors wouldn't have done this or that, usually.  One reviewer said student filmmakers are very savvy these days, and the filming wouldn't have been that rough around the edges. He said this totally spoiled the movie for him.  Lighten up  all fiction, and especially horror fiction, requires suspension of disbelief.  And horror films are notorious for having plot holes, unlikely things happening, and people going where they shouldn't.  In fact, in a lot of horror flicks, if people acted realistically there would be no plot!  And obviously fake studio-lot trees and dry-ice `fog' certainly didn't keep `The Wolf Man' from being a horror classic, at least not for me.I also disagree that finding out how the film was made or that it isn't a true story make it a lesser experience.  Sure didn't for me.   And I'm glad to see some other comments here that tell me I'm not the only one with the `hangover' effect  it ran across my mind for days after I saw it.  By the nature of its filming, Blair Witch gets a little vague in its plot sometimes, but it more than makes up for this with its freshness and genuine thrills.I also appreciate the intricate Internet and TV framework of mythology  what negative reviewers call `hype' -- that's been built up around the movie.  I think it's a stroke of genius.There's talk of a sequel.  Personally, I'd like to see a `prequel' built around the Blair Witch mythology created on the film's home page and in the Sci-Fi special, `Curse of the Blair Witch.'All in all, I'd rate this right up there with `The Exorcist' and the original version of `The Haunting' as the best of the post-1960 horror films.  Although each has its own special brand of horror, each keeps its place well secured in my memory.  As to those who are disappointed that they didn't `see the witch' or needed some presence to scare them, blame modern horror cinema for spoiling them with special effects and gore.  Those who don't like the film for these reasons would never `get' a classic ghost story.",9,1,2,20 August 1999
American Beauty," Oddly moving
","Seems people are really polarized on this one.  Depends on your perspective of life, I guess, and your tolerance for some rough subject matter -- drug use, drug dealing, older man seduces teenager (or vice versa!), latent homosexuality, a murder, etc. Also on your understanding of Zen ... Wes Bentley's character's preoccupation with something blowing in the breeze, Kevin Spacey's character's coming to beatific acceptance of life.One of my co-workers hated it because of the subject matter.  But you have to go beyond that to get to the heart of 'American Beauty.'  I don't approve of drug dealing, and all that, but here those things are used to make very strong and sometimes conflicting points.This is a movie that says a lot and says it eloquently.  I think it's the best film I've seen in quite a while.I won't go on, but let me say this.  For those who didn't like the movie, there's something in one of Spacey's last lines that addresses this -- a very ironic twist, as if he's anticipating that some of the audience won't understand the movie's point.I remember that line more than any other in the movie ... if you didn't like the film, it probably slipped right past you and you  won't remember it.  Go back and see if you can catch this very poignant bit of observation.",10,0,0,18 February 2000
When Harry Met Sally...," One beautiful movie
","I agree with all the superlatives that other reviewers expressed.  This is one movie that I can watch over and over.  Great performances and chemistry from Crystal and Ryan, a clever plot, and some great devices (interviewing successful couples, the Crystallisms).  It never gets stale for me.  One of the best relationship-based comedies I've ever seen.",10,0,1,15 November 2001
