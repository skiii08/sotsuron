The Rock," F....is the key
","Living proof of a film script writer with an I Q of the average doormat! the F Word appears more times in this film than any other I have watched in a long time. the best part is the chase thru San Francisco but ultimately this is for those ONLY who enjoy an action packed film with gratuitous violence and excessive use of foul language and blasphemy - simply for the sake of it. They could have done so much better with an improved script. NOT a film I should be watching a 2nd time, really not aged that well",4,2,6,14 June 2019
Vertigo," Watch This One!
","I will try not to spoil it for you - if you haven't seen it. Stewarts character suffers from vertigo, hence the title. As it Hitchcock directing, he will play on this 'disability' over and over. However, what you have here is a well presented thriller with a hero with issues who sets out to learn how he can get over his problems whilst trying to learn about what hes been missing. Great music that fits, characters that come together well. Young Kim Novak looks stunning every time she is on screen. A real thriller with lots to recommend it to be watched",9,0,1,12 January 2020
The Finest Hours," Not a hair out of place!
","To make a true story, especially one as remarkable as this for what was achieved, you need a bit more realism! The 'heroin' of the piece miraculously doesn't freeze in her car (without a coat) in the snow, nor does she ever have a hair out of place in the windy conditions, plus turning your engine off and leaving the lights on would 'kill the car battery' which it doesn't. THIS IS worth a watch. Sadly, Disney doesn't capture what was achieved here hence why I cant score it any higher. Achievements like this deserve a much better script, much better direction and more realism",6,0,0,9 January 2019
Marie Antoinette," A curiosity!
","According to this version, the future King was 'gay'. Totally disinterested in women!. Given that historically he did Father children it is something of a surprise to hear the line (early on) 'he prefers the company of the stable lad'!....stay with it if you wish, but this doesn't come across as historically accurate in the opening 40 minutes.",3,0,3,27 July 2019
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great Entertainment
","I cannot give it more than 6, simply because 'biblically' this is quite inaccurate. Its never going to happen that 'ghouls' and such like charge out of the Ark of the Covenant' and kill all those stood around it/near it...Speilberg has presented a great story here until 'the box is opened' and that brings out the 'theatrics' of film where the director speculates as to the actual power of The Ark of the Covenant. Lots of fun, but don't take it too seriously, especially twhen the archaeologist threatens to destroy the Ark-something he couldn't do if he were to ever find it",6,0,2,13 April 2020
Deja Vu," Deja BALLONY!
","Or Bullony which ever it is? For Sci-Fi fans only who believe that time travel is possible, in this case - 4 days, to save the life of a dead woman that you haven't met and don't actually know! far fetch, totally unbelievable, and ending which cant be believed. Given the cast on offer I would have expected better Mr Scott and not 2 hours of buncomb/garbage/put it in the bin. nothing in this could be described as entertaining....another 2 hours of life wasted!",2,0,2,17 March 2020
Dead Poets Society," WOW - Watch this!
","That said, it doesn't have a happy ending....this is a really well crafted film which is about the relationship between a group of privileged boys in a top notch school and their new English teacher (Robin Williams)....the head master is quite vile (Think: 'Im in charge'!)....and some of the boys parents can only be politely described as 'tyrants'....if I said more than that I would spoil it for you. We have just watched this during lockdown and apart from several times shouting at the screen, due to the injustices, it really a well presented and should be watched. I would have liked a happier ending, but that isn't what this film is actually about - watch it, see what you think - highly recommended. the Boys are all superb as is Robin Williams",9,1,1,4 June 2020
Home Alone," Great Fun!
","And not to be taken too seriously, given the number of times the little boy goes out of the front door yet miraculously always gets back in without the need of A KEY! just one of the hiccups if you look closely. Roberts Blossom is the elderly, and as it turns out, friendly neighbour who have a lovely little 'turn'! The last quarter features the real fun when the criminals eventually decide to get into the house and the 8 year old is ready for them....cue - lots of fun and laughs, which given our current UK lockdown, this will ease some of the difficulties for a short while. Enjoyable!",7,0,0,17 April 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," Yaaaawwwnnnn!
","Sorry, being a speilberg fan I can only suggest that within the 1st 40 minutes the idea of 2 senior police men/FBI officers falling over a cat along with several other issues during this half of the film I found it dull and sleep would have been more enjoyable. I would think suitable for Kids familiar with Tintin, but the cartoons from my childhood were much more fun.",4,0,0,18 May 2020
Ocean's Thirteen," Bored?
","Then don't add this film to WATCH List - its not the slightest bit funny, totally uniteresting, and actually despite little foul language really doesn't have anything to commend it. I don't see why Damon, Clooney, Pitt and the others wanted to be apart of something that's meaningless twaddle. Don't bother....nothing entertaining within this 2plus hours!",3,0,0,11 May 2020
Glory," GLORY!
","If you want entertainment from a 'war film' this is not it. It pulls NO punches, it is based upon historical fact and is very well presented with a really great cast. You will see men sacrificing their lives for a nation that (in the main) treated them at this stage of history as slaves. This is about the fight for freedom and the sacrifice that many were willing to pay. I would argue outstanding. It is not entertaining, it is worth watching, but not with your children, if you have children!",8,0,0,30 September 2018
Bridge of Spies," Brilliant
","Short and to the point. This is a truly great film inspired by true events with a little 'Hollywood' thrown in. This is Mark Rylance's film, he completely 'steals it', the acting is fabulous, the 'plot' based upon true events is amazing and if you have not seen it - cancel all other engagements its well worth watching, and more than once. I may not see a better film this year",9,0,1,22 August 2018
Now You See Me," Highly Entertaining!
","Ok this isn't a particularly solid movie. However, it is entertaining to watch how 4 individuals are brought together and manage to stay 1 step ahead of the authorities. As a team they are simply common criminals and many of the magic tricks are explained during the film. Given that this is a 2 and also as I write this a 3 being made you are aware that the team continue to stay 1 step ahead all throughout. You may not see another film quite as unique in its presentation. There is very little foul language/blasphemy and no sex. But it is a film you wont want to take your eyes off",8,2,2,11 August 2019
Enchanted," Enchantless?
","Not really for the adults! A mix of animation and live action. An unconvincing prince and, typical these days, a flawed hero!. This may keep you amused for 90 minutes or so, but for us here the 'chipmunk' was the star of the movie, plus a lovely part for Tim Spall who can always be relied upon to deliver. Watchable but nothing special",4,0,7,10 September 2019
Legends of the Fall," Watch this-well worth it!
","Apart from an unloving wife to Anthony Hopkins Father figure for the 3 sons he raises in beautiful countryside. This movie is well made, has a great story and a cracker of a cast with each one playing their part. It may be seen by some as Brid Pitts film but given those around him does make this work at every level.",8,2,3,27 July 2019
Non-Stop," Non stop thrills and excitement
","A very very different type of movie and the cast played their part in making this one of the more enjoyable films I have seen this year. It wasn't until close to the end that I worked out who the villain was, you may do a bit better. I think this is quite original for 'airplane dramas' and the ending very different from others I have seen - I would call this a 'must' for all movie buffs, lots of originality in this for me and well worth watching, maybe even more than once",9,1,1,26 May 2018
Seabiscuit," Hankie required!
",One of those 'rags to riches' story.....the 3 main leads have at some point been 'losers' or no hopers with nothing to endear them. they come across a horse with the same life experiences as them - behold we end up with a lovingly told story that turns everyone into a 'winner' beating the 'goliaths' of this world. Was Chris Cooper ever better? Great casting all the way around and this is just one of those truly great story films from start to a wondrous finale - Highly recommended!,9,3,3,8 August 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Man Smart - Dinos Smarter!
","Well the incredibly stupid Mr Hammond creates 2 islands, this being the 2nd one and being really thick actually sends another team out to view his creations within their habitat. Sadly a member of his family wants (as per the 1st film) to make millions from these creatures - who don't much like the idea and once again fight back against the humans with a degree of success. Jeff Goldblum gets to fight again in this one, simply to rescue his dino loving girlfriend (julianne moore) who seems to go off the creatures the longer the film goes on!. If you want seat riveting entertainment you will get it...",6,1,3,15 July 2019
2012," Survivors!
","First of all, this is a 'Disaster movie' with one thing after another to keep the audience 'on their feet'. What is surprising given the attention to detail is that several characters (male) are pictured in WHITE shirts that remain WHITE no matter what disaster or how many disasters they get into.
For me having sat thru 2.5hours, I wont be doing it again - this is an 'end of the world movie, with survivors'....they survive in vessels known as 'Arks'! I for one didn't have to look too far to see where they got that idea from....DONT Bother, in short its not worthy of your time despite some really good casting, especially Woody Harrelson",4,0,3,13 April 2018
Unknown," Brilliant and with an unexpected twist!
","Usually, what I call unnecessary 'foul' language gets turned off in my home. However, there was something about this which starts with a guy leaving a briefcase at the airport and due to a freak accident ends up with memory loss and with help retraces his steps until 'the penny drops'. Action Packed, full of the unusual and a terrific ending....My suggestion is you watch this at least once",8,4,6,27 January 2019
K-19: The Widowmaker," Watch this one!
","And, if you take my advice, you wont make a judgment until you have seen it through to the end.....Two great leads in Ford and Neeson who work well together. A simply story about a nuclear Russian submarine in the 1960s with the crew sent out with 2nd rate equipment and are expected to manage, especially when theres a problem which could lead to a war or a major tragedy for the world IF the submarine were to blow up with its nuclear contents. The director, for me, has done a really good job in presenting this film, which for the most part is based upon a historical incident.",8,0,0,2 June 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," 'whats it all about!'
","As someone with an enjoyment of Sci-fi, films, TV etc. I have to confess this, for me, is a load of twaddle! not something to waste your time over. I haven't, and Ive tried more than once, to get thru to the end. Its not a film worth watching, nor spending any time over. Bit Surprised to see Leonard Rossiter in a small part, but even he couldn't save this from what I can only describe as 'monotonous' and time is short and you and I surely have better things to do!",3,5,10,12 May 2019
Selma," Not for the 'easily offended'!....
","Given that 'Hollywood' has put its own take (not 100% accurate) into this piece of history, if you believe that a dark skinned person is inferior to you - please do not watch this film. We all have the 1 God and this film does not pull any punches as to what it is actually about. A piece of History that perhaps America and elsewhere might wish to forget. It is engrossing, it does get emotional and you will see people being beaten and killed simply because of the colour of their skin and their wish to have a vote...I would strongly recommend everyone to watch this at least once with an open mind and heart and understand what a small number went thru in order to have a right to be accepted",8,0,2,23 October 2018
La La Land," 'whats it all about.......'
","For a film that has numerous credits, I found this to be a tedious bore. After an hour it was replaced by something more exciting and uplifting (an episode on 'hannay' from the 70s!!). Unless youre into musicals I wouldn't bother. What everyone saw in this isn't clear. Bland!",2,0,1,5 March 2019
Love & Mercy," Driven by Strong Language
","I find strong language interferes with the telling of a story whether true or other. This one, is for the most part, true. I got through about 50 minutes and due to increasing blasphemy and strong language had to hit delete. Given this is one of the greatest song writers and producers this world has ever known the language, which the USA seems to think is necessary to sell a movie, spoiled it. IF you are going to watch - be warned. If you want to know what Brian Wilson really went through, best that you read it!",4,0,0,11 May 2020
Arrival," No 'Jim Kirk'?
",I haven't watched the full movie as from beginning to when I stopped (part way thru) I was struggling to make any sense of it! Aliens have arrived and the best we can offer them is a Colonel and a young linguistics expert....really shows how much we may not know. This isn't what I would class as entertainment and there didn't seem to be much to learn other than the Earth isn't able to cope with the arrival of Aliens. Given the highest ranking officer is 'Colonel' which beggars any form of belief....if you want entertainment watch something else. Mr Renner looks as though hes just out of college and Ms Adams doesn't look old enough to be a lecturer,2,1,4,25 July 2019
The Blind Side," Blind-Sided!
","WOW!, if you haven't seen this, which is based upon a true story, it is well worth watching, no sex, no violence, just an honest film focusing when someone who could be described as 'down and out' is taken in by a family. For once a very enjoyable family type film, even if Hollywood goes over the top with the way the family and the central character are portrayed",9,0,1,3 October 2018
Live Free or Die Hard," Vulgarity not to be taken seriously!
","Given how many more scraps mr mcclean goes thru to get to this set of villains is quite remarkable. clearly bored with being there yet again to save his country and this time his daughter too. he blasphemes and swears continuously whilst almost single-handedly beating the cheats, who this time are after billions of money from the average American tax payer (joel osteen without teeth!) This ones a computer hacker with an army. I lost count of how many lift shafts and bridges Willis actually manages to survive falling from and the number of bullets he takes! given that all the explosions MUST be computer generated this really isn't worth watching, the premise is good at the start but 2 hours is too long for something with a very poor plot line and an unbelievable dull hero that seems to be indestructible. Realism - NON existent, given how fast and easy the villains are killed off 1 by one. Sad, but true, the Good Guy does have a problem with female villains even when they are trying to kill him-that's when the movie descends into the fantasy world!",4,0,0,5 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," WHO writes this stuff??????
",I got thru about an hour of this until it became clear that the 'evil one' with the face mask is the son of 'Han Solo'....that was enough......the 1st hour wasn't up to much with lots of explosions and unexplained murder of innocent people for a map!....Lucasfilms should have left it after the first 6...not worth the effort nor the money it took to make it,4,13,15,2 April 2020
Joy," Find the OFF Switch!
","We survived the 1st 15minutes of this, which includes the fact that JOYs mum never leaves her bedroom, watches TV all day, then suddenly someone brings Mr De Niro into the house and says 'he cant stay with me anymore'....queue argument and DeNiro smashing things up to lots of abuse from the lazy mother who still hasnt moved off the bed despite her obvious 'quality attire'......IF THIS is the sort of film that you (a grown adult) want to watch, keep watching.....not for us and NOT for the kids!",2,0,0,15 June 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," me.....me.....me.....me!
","This is about the 4th time I have watched this all the way thru. the older I get the more I see things not seen before. Mr Jones (senior) is a very selfish man who cares only for his research, knows nothing about the world and the people in it, including his own family. Michael Byrne has great fun as a nasty Nazi. Alison Doodys eyes give her character away as what is important to her-herself...but I wont spoil it for you if you haven't yet seen it. Julian Glover has his usual polish performance and always makes a good villain, but again 'me me me' is all important to him and he willingly lets others do his dirty world. Not clear WHY Hitler would want the 'Holy Grail', given that he destroys everything 'Jewish' and the Grail cannot leave where they find it. All of this said, its a fun film, entertaining which shouldn't be taken too seriously. John Rhys-Davies doesn't have as an effective part as in the 1st one, but always good to have him in a film for what he adds, this one is no exception. Speilberg has done much better with other films. not one of his better ones in my view",6,0,2,9 January 2020
The Great Gatsby," Decedent!
","I have not watched the full movie as within 30 minutes its clear that this is about a group of immoral folk in 20s America. There is a warning for younger people NOT to watch it, which is just as well. whilst we are not prudes when everyone is clearly having 'sex' with those whom they are not married to in this era clearly it becomes unsuitable for some of us to find an alternative option. We have!",2,0,5,7 January 2020
The Proposal," Great Fun!
","Ideal film if you want something that's a bit different, comedy-entertaining with an interesting story line and a great cast to match it. No blood and guts, this one is about a woman who proposes to a man to remain in the USA. Well worth watching, great entertainment",8,0,0,24 February 2019
Cinderella Man," WOW-A Knockout Film!
","Amazing set of ingredients for a movie...Ron Howard directing, Russell Crowe taking the Lead with a fine group of actors to back him up. For those not into boxing this isn't for you. For those of you who want a story of someone who goes from fame to living on hand outs to fame then this is a movie you do not want to miss. I'm not adding anything to spoil it for you - I cried, but it was well worth watching if you can manage the bruising boxing bouts. powerful stuff, great film, bravo to all involved",8,1,1,14 April 2018
Jurassic Park," NO expense spared!
","Which is from a statement made by the founder of 'the park', 'john Hammond', who according to the script spent millions of his own money developing the park and yet failed to get trustworthy folk to 'run the ship'. he puts his grandchildren in danger whilst he sits eating ice cream - wouldn't you?, he sends others out to rescue his grandkids - wouldn't you? having watched this recently for the 2nd time, I did 'spot holes' in the script hence why I have scored it only 6 instead of more as in my view, whilst only a motion picture, if you had this amount of money surely you would find something more worthwhile to spend it on than recreation of dinosaurs which can kill!! for those who want entertainment - this is it, but scary!",6,0,4,12 July 2019
