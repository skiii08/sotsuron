The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Excellent addition to the 'Twilight Saga'
","First of all, I need to apologize for the last review I posted here for this movie. It's just that I was really angry at all the harsh criticism of it even before it came out and after it came out. Give it a chance. In fact, give the whole 'Twilight Saga' a chance. The fans deserve to be treated with respect & dignity . . . they had been waiting for 'Breaking Dawn' to be translated to the big screen for quite a while now, so cut the film, and the fans, some slack :)Now to return to the movie. I saw it about a month ago with my mom & a girlfriend who is a 100% bona fide 'Twihard' (and proud of it). We all LOVED it! I was really impressed with how it was done. Please ignore the harsh reviews of this movie posted here . . . those who did post them have no idea what they're talking about. Shame on them, but opinions are opinions, that's all I can say about that. I seriously can't wait for part 2, because part 1 started and ended on really fabulous notes (I won't reveal any spoilers whatsoever) Bravo to everyone who worked on the 'Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn part 1', and the 'Twilight Saga' as a whole. All of you deserve to be respected for all your hard work to bring these books to life on screen",10,1,9,20 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," 'La Belle Fantastique!' A beautiful and fitting ending to The Twilight Saga
","Okay, let me just say one thing: ENOUGH of the negative criticism already! Sheesh, give the die-hard fans a break . . . they have done NOTHING wrong except love the book and movie series.The movie was AWESOME as all hell! Bella looked amazing as a vampire (if only all of us women could look that good after having a baby, considering how she looked at the end of Part 1). Definitely don't want to cross her now because she WILL beat you to the ground. So powerful! Plus Edward loves her even more now than he did when she was human. And their sweet precious baby Renesmee . . . I think the CGI effect with her aging looked flawless, though it did take some getting used to at first. Mackenzie Foy is such a cutie pie! Awww, you want to pinch her cheeks and squeeze her in a tight hug. I won't reveal spoilers, so I'll just say the top secret sequence they had in the movie was really intense. To top it all off, the ending was very, very fitting to the entire series. Overall,it was really awesome, beautifully done, and I can safely say that Bella & Edward's love story has come full circle.Now a simple message from a fellow Twihard to their brethren: PLEASE DO NOT pay any attention whatsoever to the haters,they don't know what they are talking about. Go right ahead and shout it from the rooftops that you love the Twilight books and movies, don't let anyone get you down. All of you,myself included, have deserved to see the cinematic representation of The Twilight Saga come to an extremely satisfying conclusion.",10,5,11,15 March 2013
Titanic," So Beautiful. So Tragic. So Good!!!!!
","If only the voting ratings were higher than 10 . . . I would give this grand film a 20. I watched it for the first time about four years ago or so, and let me just say, I bawl like a baby every time I watch it. It remains my absolute favorite movie. I LOVE the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack & Kate Winslet's Rose (you just don't see romances like that anymore, which is a shame). I enjoy watching their romance grow until the very end. James Cameron was right in making sure that the audience gets an 'emotional doorway', to use his words, to realize just how tragic the Titanic disaster really was by having them, as well as Jack & Rose, go through the events that led to the sinking . . . Did Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) ever do stuff like the things Jack did for Rose, risking his life because he loved her so much? I don't think so, because he didn't really care about her, or even love her for that matter . . . so Billy Zane did a fantastic job at portraying this character you just love to hate! All the other actors in this film, particularly Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart, & Bill Paxton, did fabulous as well. The scenery, the music (makes me cry even if I hum a few bars), the costumes, etc are FABULOUS! James Cameron, you are a genius & will be forever remembered for this epic masterpiece, for bringing this tragedy that happened a century ago, to astounding life!!!!! I applaud you for this tenfold. Bravo! Well done!",10,6,12,21 February 2011
The Silence of the Lambs," So creepy, so good!
","I watched this movie with my mom about a few months ago . . . And let me just say I was floored! I liked it, very intense & creepy, especially Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Lecter . . . that mask . . . that voice . . . 'Closer, please. Closer' . . . , as well as the chemistry between him and Jodie Foster as Clarice . . . no wonder people are still terrified! There are parts that may make one cringe, particularly scenes with Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill . . . but that is the whole point of the film . . . it's supposed to scare you! But not in the way one might think! Yet if you have seen it, there's one thing that makes you wonder: What would the BAU team of 'Criminal Minds' think of these two killers? I can only imagine . . . wow!!!! Anyways, when I watched this film, I was stock still whenever Dr. Lecter appeared on screen (really!) He's downright scary. So . . . to bring this review to a close, I liked this film overall. But that brings me to one last question, movie fans, to quote Dr. Lecter: 'You wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, and hear the screaming of the lambs?'",10,1,2,31 January 2011
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," One of the BEST Vampire Movies around!
","Let's just safely say I absolutely love this movie! Tom Cruise as Lestat . . . he really embodies the character well. I can't see any other actor be Lestat but him. Pure perfection! Everyone else in this movie (Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, etc.) did really good as well. I could definitely see why Anne Rice was pleased when she saw a screening of it when it came out . . . It's fabulous! I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Maybe it would make one want to be a vampire via Lestat's bite . . . sure would me . . . Anyways, I didn't really like Tom Cruise until I saw this movie. Yet now if someone were to ask me if I like him, I would say 'Yes! He's Lestat.' So there you go. He's amazing as this beautiful blond immortal, sprung from the pen of Anne Rice, and I applaud his performance. Same with Brad Pitt as Louis. Wow!",10,0,1,15 January 2011
