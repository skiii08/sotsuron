The Blair Witch Project," My Opinion
","This was the best movie I have ever seen! It is more real life than most horror movies, and it was very well done. It kept you at the edge of your seat, and you always wonder... what IS the Blair Witch? A great movie, scary as heck! I RECOMMEND!",10,1,2,12 September 1999
