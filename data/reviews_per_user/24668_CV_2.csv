Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't listen to the critics, here or elsewhere
","After all, we want to see space opera when walking into Phantom Menace - NOT (snicker) Fellini, Hitchcock or Kubrick. We want to see a sci-fi thrillride and learn what leads us to the events of the original trilogy.Admittedly, the first @15 minutes are pretty juvenile, and had me groaning - but once they leave the goofy-looking city (you'll know it when you see it) and head for the Core, it gets really entertaining. The effects, the battle scenes are all great fun, and the Pod Race is not to be missed. It's Star Wars meets Ben Hur.And if you're OBSESSING over the fact that the dialogue seems geared to the younger members of the audience, I suggest you re-watch the originals. They're not exactly Truffaut themselves.Those of you wanting a dour, serious experience and brilliant Thespian writing and plot elements better not have one word of complaint leaving the theater, because if you expected these things from a Star Wars movie, you might actually want to SEE one first (they're readily available in video stores across the land).For those who are going to see the movie for all the RIGHT reasons (you know who you are), don't listen to the amateur Eberts around here - it's well worth the price of admission!",Null,0,0,26 May 1999
The Matrix," It'll make a liar out of your watch
","I knew when even the critics gave it positive reviews that it must be sheer sci-fi brilliance...Brilliance doesn't approach this engrossing, enthralling experience. I even had 'lying watch' syndrome. When the films over, you look at your watch, and cannot believe the movie was as long as it was, because you were sucked in to the credits. I last had that feeling during the Usual Suspects and L.A. Confidential. Maybe I've just got a thing for brilliant noir-action fusion, but this movie is a winner. I'm glad it came out before Star Wars I, or even I probably would've ignored it...See this movie. See this movie now.",9,0,0,3 April 1999
