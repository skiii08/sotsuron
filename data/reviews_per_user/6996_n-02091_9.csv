It," Greatest horrible movie experience ever!
","Not always a big fan of horrible movies, but this time I have to say this one really impressed me. Though the storyline might be simple and lack of some sort of metaphor but totally make sense which can be kind of rare in nowaday movie industry. The cast may be young but the performance is totally convincing. The sound effects are also great as well.",8,0,1,6 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Just Stunning in an Unbelievable Way!
","Sure,unlike La La Land, A Star Is Born might seem to be a corny love story to someone. But the chemistry between Bradley and Gaga is just so fascinating. Don't wanna spoil anything, but all I have to say is this movie is just so emotionally infective. I felt so emotionally drained after seeing this movie, but now the movie has touched me so deeply that I'm still not able to fall asleep. And of course the music is so great. What's even more huge is that I heard all the soundtracks were recorded alive. Here's a tip: don't watch this movie the night before your workday or trust me you're gonna not be to fall asleep after witness such a beautiful story and all you wanna do is to listen to the soundtrack over and over again that night! And if you could, do make sure you go to the one with Dolby audio, it is gonna be nothing but incredible!",10,2,5,7 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A whole story for a missing part in the former Starwar series.
","Well the whole thing is just about how many people had died for the map that Luke used to destroy the dead story. Really happy to see some Asian actors in the Starwar series. But the whole thing is kind of cruel only to know something that already happened. I don't know, after seeing this one I just felt kind of lose, not like other BEs to encourage something nice in my life.",7,0,2,7 October 2018
Dangal," Inspiring and Cheerful
","Aamir is such a great actor and produce who can touch every single audience's deepest feeling with a simple story like many of his movies and of course this one. Though I'm Chinese, the last scene successfully got me standing up and applauding for the India's winning. What I really admire is how he keep passing these positive energy to every audience thoughout his whole career and every single country really needs an entertainer like him.",9,0,0,6 October 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A completement to the child memory of Harry Potter.
","The movie is good, and a nice completement to my childhood memories, but maybe just no more.",7,1,2,7 October 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A TOTAL EMOTION KNOCKOUT.
","A great end of an era. That's all I need to say. Not a crazy Marvel fan, but this one just got me right away.",9,5,13,24 April 2019
A Quiet Place," Greatest sound effects, good performance by the whole cast while the storyline is too far-fetched.
","Sincerely the sound effects are amazing, the I can feel my heartbeats when it comes to the quiet moments as the movie tittle covered, which can considered to be really successful as a scary movie. And though some of the cast members might be young, but their performance can still be really convincing. However, the storyline is too far-fetched and sometimes even too unreasonable and maybe even stupid. If I have to say it aloud, I would say just have that god damn baby near the waterfall!!! So although how great the effects and cast could be, the pale story cannot really impress me.",6,0,0,6 October 2018
Logan," Unexpected Great
",The storyline is fascinating and so is the performance of Hugh Jackman. Literally the one movie from Marvel Studio lately could compare to the Dark Knight.,8,2,4,7 October 2018
The Shape of Water," One of the Most Stunning Experiences in the Theater!
","The color, the music and everything else are just stunning even I can only watch the tailored version in China. Love the 'spolling eggs' as a metaphor thoughout the whole movie. Totally worth the best picture!",9,3,11,6 October 2018
