Black Swan," Pop Corn and Art
","This movie reminds me on how one average American imagines art. Probably the same way that the whale imagines how is it to fly as an eagle. This movie is a cheap insult for Chaikovsky. Pulling up the standard prosaic and narrow film ideas to imply art, Hollywood brings this time one more dull and unimaginative film work. Black Swan has no film pattern at all. No film rhythm. No film plot. And no art sparkles at all. It is the same tense in the beginning as at the end. Or is the life of pro ballet player with difficulties she is facing a film plot just because Chaikovsky is involved? Poor Chaikovsky could not melt in this tele novela mish-mash of sex and twist, love and hate. Did I say that this is definitely the worst movie of Vincent Cassel? And above all Mr director, even if you latently tried to film the Swan Lake you should be aware of the fact that film and ballet are two different art categories. Did you say 8.6 grade??? I am definitely leaving IMDb. Do svidaniya!",1,121,230,15 January 2011
Captain Phillips," Just wondering
","Hi there, how are you? Are you OK? Are you really OK? Are you sure you are OK cause you don't look OK. These are the words of the ER chief talking to the captain at the end of this movie. Please, don't get me wrong but I got to ask you the same thing. Are you OK or my myopia worsened? 8.1 grade for this flick? I just can't figure out what is more pathetic in this movie: Clumsy pirates who would probably fail to kidnap the cat from most of the neighbors or whole army of navy ships followed by navy seals that are chasing them? Let me get this straight, thousands of people got kidnapped every day all over the world, so what was so special about this one to waste two film hours? Because he was the captain of the big money ship so whole US navy went after him? And what really happened during this two hours? What about the plot (he is being kidnapped - that's not even the synopsis), thrill, engagement, maybe some twist? Tom Hanks is one of the most brilliant actors in Hollywood and there is some very good acting in this movie but what else makes this a high grade movie? Please, excuse me for being so ignorant.",3,45,108,16 December 2013
John Wick," Yarp!
","It's funny but I am not sure what is 7.4 about this film? Is that Keanu Reeves? Well, this guy may know how to act but he doesn't show that in this movie. How about the plot? What is the plot? You killed my dog and stole my car and now you want to apologize? Common man, you can't apologize I got to kill you and few thousand people around you cause I can't make a movie otherwise. And a way he kills? Man, I think every single video game maker would envy this director. Oh, I must admit that this movie fulfills the Hollywood mandatory condition where Russians are the bad guys. Has anyone noticed John's replies in this movie to most of the questions asked? He just repeats what he heard and sounds like Michael Armstrong in the 'Hot Fuzz'. All in all, I would recommend this movie if you are still with sega-mega drive but if you have ever played a game called counter-strike, then you might consider this movie boring. For all other viewers, just don't bother.",1,22,42,21 January 2015
Gravity," What???
","First of all, folks, I need a lesson. Define the term - feature film. If that is only and only about the film length - I may understand why do we call this a movie. Everything else looks like a interesting part of 'Spacey Oddissey' that can be put in few single scenes. And that's about it. I will add more words cause the site policy asks for more. OK. What is the thing that involves you here? Space? Well, then some National Georphic shows and documentaries should be in this IMDb category as well. Yeah, good acting, outstanding camera work, splendid effects, but common, is this where is the plot??? Fight of a cosmonaut versus space? Then why don't we put a man in the cage with a bear and if he get close to survival, we'll be able to make a film gem! What a sad day for the movies in general, especially for SF. 8.4 grade? A Space Odyssey has got 8.3! Well, I guess some new film appreciations are coming out.",1,25,53,23 December 2013
Lone Survivor," Well done
","Finally a solid war movie came out of Hollywood after a while. It is very watchable and tense all the time. Pretty well story telling, involving and convincing. Good acting. There are some minor downsides but only one real problem with this movie, if you ask me. I understand that 'Lone Survivor' has been made after the real events. However, it is still a feature movie, so it needs a well standing plot logics. I do appreciate the artistic freedom of the director as well as following the facts, but I can't really accept the horse and the dove standing on the same branch. It makes at least one big hole in the movie plot. This is why I can't accept that everything over here happened because four members of the elite special forces deep behind enemy lines let the imprisoned Al Kaida go only for the fact that they were unarmed or too young/old to be shot but not to shoot. I can even accept that these are the facts - but in that case I am sure that we needed the additional explanation to understand the whole picture, not just few isolated facts. And this is what makes these facts very weak: The prisoners where not armed and not part of their mission so they didn't want to kill them. I am not sure about you but I do find this logical until some point. But not the part where they don't want to tie them up. 1. Cause they might freeze to death. They were tough locals living in the place closer to stone age than a/c or gas heating condos, I doubt they would freeze over just one night. 2. They would be eaten by the wolves. 99% of people killed by the wolves are coming from the Hollywood movies. In reality, wolves are afraid of people and are avoiding them. In my opinion, chances of wolves attacking people even if tide up are low. 3. Most important, we talk about the indigenous people, people who know the area as their pocket and are moving like cougars on these stones. Don't you think that someone from the village would notice they disappeared and go after them, if they just left them there? And then, there are their goats all around to notice them easier if that is necessary at all since they were all the time around a mile or two from the village so there were great chances that they would have been found quickly while the seals would have enough time to boogie. Like this, movie scenario suggests that this story happened because four navy seals decided to play good Samaritans and even more than that to make themselves absolutely sure that nothing bad will happen to their Al Kaida prisoners or at least potential Al Kaida company. Once again, I think that movie is still entertaining if we can call it that way since it seems that lot of people died there for real.",6,3,13,5 January 2014
Fury," Good
","This film contains two faces. One represents good filmmaking and pretty good war drama depicting, some drama realism of the war that we haven't seen in the US movies for a very long time. In that way, this is one of the best war movies that Hollywood has ever produced, from my point of view. The war atmosphere, social profile of the soldiers in the US army and their dialogs are among the best I have ever seen regarding the American movies. We have all been used to watch the American soldiers in the US movies as the charming knights in the shining armour but in this movie it was far from that and much closer to reality. Acting was very good. I also think that the director has seen the Apocalypse Now and the Iron Cross but also Russian 9-th Rota, and utilized everything he liked from them.However, the other face of this film is an irritating low sense for technical and strategical military reality of WWII:Battle scenes are more suitable for a fairy tale than for a war movie: Germans in an AT ambush are being ambushed by the four Sherman tanks, kind a ridiculous. Tiger tank which was a heavy tank with a much longer shooting range than the medium Sherman tank was never running towards the incoming tank group but rather shooting from a distance (or retreat if necessary) where the enemy tanks couldn't have reached it which was its main advantage. Its like you're holding a gun and you see four guys with knives running after you and instead of shooting at them while retreating, you start running at them, like â€“ now I'm going to smash your had with this gun! Above all, lets mention that Germans put their best men to be the tiger tank crew so it was almost impossible to destroy that tank from the ground. This is why the US Air force was sent after tigers in most of the cases - US dive bombers dropping huge bombs on the tiger turrets were the only real weapon against these tanks, cause even if you ambushed them with medium tanks, you couldn't approach them as they were always escorted with light or medium tanks.Killing 300 SS soldiers with a non-mobile Sherman tank is more for some Disney Cartoon (I won't go into the details where SS soldiers are aiming a tank with a panzer-Faust from the 3 meter distance even though that weapon could shoot from a range from 30 to 150 meters. It's like you approach to 30 feet range to shoot an enemy with a sniper rifle . And one Molotov cocktail ends the tank that can't move in a jiffy.Also, a tank lieutenant that is jumping on a highly decorated SS officer on a horse and killing him without problem is more suitable for some John Wayne movie and has nothing to do with WWII reality. There is an idea that the group is experienced Africa corp unit but you got to now then that they were fighting the more experienced and incomparably more trained, armed and successful German troops here. Also, few scenes where Germans beg for life which is more than ridiculous cause Germans were fanatics and such thing didn't happen with their POW. Don't forget, Germany was fighting USSR and the US at the same time and still was so hard to break their spine.",6,6,18,16 January 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Pale, poor and pretty stupid
","Just one of the proves of Tarantino's decreasing film maker career - The Inglorious Bastards can probably suit the expectations and intellect of an unimaginative child. Shame for wasted money and some very good acting. The film is presenting a way how five year old American sees WWII. Poor sarcasm and pretty shallow plot development are the most hurting parts of the movie which is giving you the hard time for two and a half hours! Insult for everyone who has obtained Primary School diploma out of US but also for the audience who admired Tarantino at the time of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, The Inglorious Bastards is a ridiculous mishmash of different film styles served on the fast-mood plate adjusted for American Pop Corn cinemas.",2,12,21,30 January 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," Overrated
","This film is a nice art try to make a thrilling mystery. Beautiful colors, costumes, nice recreation of the 70s and not bad acting. These are the things that most of the movies coming from Hollywood are missing and should learn something from here. What I also love about this film is sophisticated development of emotional relations between the characters along with the main movie plot. What this movie misses pretty much are serious corrections regarding scenario. Most of dialogs are too long and confusing and completely unnecessary making pretty easy plot very complicated to follow. Some scenes look very amateurish therefore. That makes whole movie too long without any necessity and the movie pace too slow making some of the scenes look like Telenovelas. All in all, we may call this film a cute work of art but pretty overrated. I mean, this film gets the same IMDb rate as 2001 Space Odyssey ... Common!!",5,14,54,22 April 2010
Terminator Salvation," Pathetic
","There is nothing good about this movie, even if you do your best to find something as a Terminator admirer. Exploitation of Terminator film dynasty, very sensitive topics of human nature and SF action plot are all equal to zero. Pale plot development made me stop watching for a few times being close to falling asleep. Movie visual is the worst Mad Max recreation I have ever seen. Shallow messages that film sends are insult for the intellect of 6 years old kid. So is there a Terminator without Schwarzenegger? It may be, but not this one. All in all, one of the sad proves that world of action movies was moved from North American continent time ago. Zero out of ten.",1,4,9,11 August 2009
The Last Legion," Sweet fairy tale falsification, but not the last legion
","One of the sweet history falsifications nicely implied into the fine family movie. A lot of Anglo-Saxon and Western propaganda on the Ancient history, as usual. A lot of facts mixed up with a lot of historical nonsense make this film a mish-mash good afternoon entertainment for your kid. First of all, the path of the last Western Roman Emperor has nothing to do with this movie. Emperor August was captured by Odocar and sent to Southern Italy fortress from where he never came back as far as history knows. He did not have blood of the Caesars but was a son of a Roman who was Athila's clerk in occupied Pannonia region and who came to high position in Rome and later appointed his 12 year of son as Romulus Augustulus a Roman Emperor. There was no sword of Julius Caeser connected to King Arthur (whose existence has also never been proved), no Legions to fight Goths or anyone else to save the emperor ... also, we got some banal mistakes as wrong costumes of Eastern Roman uniforms at that time - ones shown in the movie look like Arabian. Worst of all is global encyclopedia dogma served in this movie as well: this was not the last legion; the last Roman Legion had seen the seventh century in the Estern Roman Empire. After that was transformed as military formation. Also, that time was not the fall of Rome, because Rome lasted all the way to 15th century even though attacked, ravaged, sacked and raped by the worst criminals in human history - 'Crusaders' and imperiled by many other barbarians and savages mostly coming from the very same west. That is what Rome left as legacy to Brits: pillage and hunger for the Roman gold. Whole Churches had been sacked and transported to the west during these decades of ravaging. Capitol of the Roman Empire from 4th century - Constantinople, lasted for almost 1000 years more as biggest and most developed city in that time world by all means. It is so hard for today Westerners to mention that and it is clear why. Even without mentioning Christianity in the West or the East, Last Legion got lost trying to imply the topic of 'Fall of the Roman Empire' being clumsy in covering the fact that only the Western Roman Province of Italy had fallen, and Roman Empire continued to exist for thousand years more developing a high civilization that is going to distinguish every day more and more from barbarians around them, including these that occupied Italy, all the way until she falls. All in all, turn on your DVD players and turn off your brain ...",2,3,9,20 August 2010
Warrior," Eight point free(k)
","Welcome to one more Hollywood emotional narrowness that apparently works in the American film market today. The story of an angry brother has been seen many times in plenty of forms. I do not really see anything special or different with this one. Movie is very well done, good pace and good film rhythm, very good acting and excellent Nick Nolt, all in all pretty watchable no doubt. But grade 8.3??? Please, be advised that this is a higher grade than for example 'Gone with a wind' has. I do agree that the movie as any other art should be the matter of taste as music for example, but I can't say that Justin Bieber's song deserves higher music grade than Mozart's Requiem only because I am impressed with it (I am not, that was only an example). Sometimes I ask myself is there anyone above 10 years of age on this movie site?",6,3,18,24 November 2011
District 9," Pretty weak
","This is a nice attempt of making an interesting George Orwell style SF film. Clear message behind the human relations with alien nation could be used to describe relations between many social structures in our World: Unions, Countries or different social levels inside the countries. First thing that occurred to me is relation between the western 'civilization' and nations that are announced as 'troubled' now days, just like 'The Prawns' in the movie. However, this is about everything interesting speaking of this film. Movie is suffocated by insisting on documentary style which can't follow the SF surrounding making it look like surreal comic book, instead of real. The plot is slow and boring, movie gets a little bit tent at the very end. Pity, as we also have a very convincing acting and pretty solid casting. 3 out of 10.",3,2,6,23 September 2009
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Welcome to the video game where you have much more than three lives!
","Glamor, unbelievably expensive cars and special effects are all stars of the movie, if any. The story is enough entertaining for the video game if you are below 6 years of age. The plot sadly exists but is so banal and shallow that it might fit in one sentence: kill the terrorist, save the world and prove that Americans rule and are almighty! And they so much are since walking into Kremlin is a peace of cake, gathering data there is easier than getting a hot dog on the local kiosk while people from time to time are becoming cats and walking on the outside wall of the tallest building in the world. The same heroes are walking into the worst sand storm and walking out in the most expensive model of BMW. Wow! If we skip all the money invested in the movie and very solid film crew along with the actors, it looks like the core idea for the movie has been written by a very small child. Don't get me wrong, I love fairy tales but even they have to follow some logic and style. Frankly, the only thing that amazes me in this movie is Tom Cruz, this guy looks the same in last 25 years.",2,10,18,31 March 2012
2012," Insult to human intelligence and film art in all ways
","It is sad that I am writing the lines about this film on the film forum and not on some kindergarten blog. Even then, if only five years old, I would probably consider that this movie was made by film entity with real absence of gray cells activity. Everything presented here is so insulting stupid. I cannot believe that someone like Danny Glover or Zlatko Buric entered this project. Well, it seems that financial crisis is not only a hysteria from mass media. If you don't have anything better to do, then just go to sleep, with no dreams at all you will feel more entertained thereafter. Oh, but if you liked The Independence Day, then this film will probably be a real gem for you.",1,2,5,15 December 2009
Gran Torino," Cute but overrated
","Cute little film but overrated. Warm human story of strange friendship that offers the warmest sincerity in this rotten world against all odds is nice and deserves attention. However, the story even though emotional and warm is somehow dry and raw and lites only the surface of our hearts. I think that Eastwood has followed the patterns of the Hollywood style to concentrate on the plot to affect our feelings more than to try to develop the characters more carefully as well as their mutual interactions with him as the main hero. On the other hand, I love the charming way he introduced all the stupidity of prejudices based on racism and especially implied it during the Asian party he was invited to. It must be very hard to direct and play the main role in the movie, so I certainly send all my respect to Clint Eastwood's work in this movie. I do not agree with some people regarding the comments on bad acting in this movie especially Clint's. I think that he fits very well the character he played.",7,2,4,9 November 2010
The Hurt Locker," Bad
","Extremely sterile and dull movie. It is just one more feature film 'documentary' where you can obviously see that director has seen Baghdad ER and did not really know how to reflect her impressions on the screen. Documentary documents reality, and that's it. Feature film has to involve the plot to make the film story come alive and that's it. It is on director how to implant that plot, but the plot has to exist. Otherwise, everyone could make a movie and everything would be a movie. Just presenting the soldiers from the bomb squad does not make any plot. That suppose to be a part of the movie - not a whole movie. The one could say that director tried to make mishmash of some good war movies from the past and documentaries as one mentioned above. All in all, pretty bad and unintelligent film, I could not stand watching the whole movie. Judging to high rankings, no hope for Hollywood.",2,12,20,15 December 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Average
","Just one of the holocaust stories told in the way that is base for stereotypes today, I believe: kids that are building the bridges of hope on the river of death where no hope exists. Slow and predictable, from time to time irritating for the reason of childish logic presented. The kind of logic that better matches director's thinking than thoughts of the little boy. Without very good camera and good acting, this film would look like average low budget attempt to make a TV movie. In return, I will present childish logic too and give a movie rate number 4, higher than it really deserves only because I like Vera Farmiga very much.",4,2,6,15 December 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Jackie Chan meets Clint Eastwood
","Fast mood art knocked on the door of the movie industry from the great Hollywood for one more time to mutilate everything valuable that the great film masters have done since the beginning of the last century. It is cozier to watch a movie than to read a book, so is cozier to watch Tarantino's filmed juvenile comic book than to watch a real film. This is how the soul-food industry for mediocre masses has replaced the film industry and by that mass-hysteria controls, manipulate and hypnotizes the movie lovers all over the Globe. Block the brain and you'll see the golden rain. Sad face of the talented director who made such epics as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but nothing valuable after that. Money and pretty sick ego became his priority. In this film he is convinced that he is at least equal to Sergio Leone so he introduced Jackie Chan to Clint Eastwood, which requires IQ of 40 or lower to love this poor and shallow filming. One more thing: stupid movies get pretty poor grades, but if you make something incredibly stupid and by that even try to beat the most stupid movies ever made, you get the highest praises from the masses. Interesting topic for social science studies and maybe even psychiatric survey.",1,5,11,31 January 2010
Ip Man," Action Masterpiece
","I must admit that I haven't been charmed by a kung fu film ever since Bruce Lee. Or should I say by action movie? This is the first film to be equal to the movies once made by the practical father of the action movie - Bruce Lee. It is sooo good that Chinese movies are not being dubbed any more. There, you can see the 'native' film scene that any film school in the world can hardly match. I have seen this film couple of times and I couldn't find anything bad about it. If you want to make film of this kind - this is the perfect example. I guess its not a big deal to find an actor that is going to look like Yip Man among one billion Chinese, but still - except resemblance on look - what an actor Grandmaster Donnie Yen is!!! And director Wilson Yip!!! His camera is like the window that mediates between film and reality - when watching this film, it looks like you are there!!! Afer Kurosawa and Bruce Lee, this is the name you should remember, if you ask me. And of course, must see!!!",10,2,5,29 August 2009
Avatar," Real Fairytale
","My review for this film will be pretty cautious because James Cameron as a very intelligent movie maker has implied a complex movie structure in here, much more than we explicitly see. I believe that touchy social geneses of today world is so obvious for every spectator who gets in this movie not only on action and technological bases but on emotional as well. Very carefully operated, so many strong messages behind the screen. Otherwise, we would probably have Disney Star War movie or SF Dancing with Wolves. Cameron started to warn the world we are calling civilized with his Terminator robots decades ago but we have never seen him drawing so clear line. Apparently, Na'vis exist ever since the time of the civilized world, they have to exist as opposite of being civilized. Their existence underlined in the start as savage and cruel is justifying the genocide and destruction done on them by our cute civilized world. First distinctive Na'vis were probably American Indians who clashed with greedy civilized colonists that did not want their precious materials only but their land as well. Indians won first battles just like Na'vis, but than ships of the civilized world came back and exterminated them, taking everything from them thereafter (here, do not miss Avatar 2). Similar things have happened over the centuries with Asian Indian, Chinese and African Na'vis for different precious materials, happens today with Iraqi people because of oil, Afghanistan because of drug profit control ... And civilized greediness never ends. Jack Sully the lonely hand of conscience is pretty lonely indeed. We can see that he and his few friends are truly dependent of the greedy empire. Does it ring your bell? Journalists, 'peacemakers' and 'world judges', everything bought or blackmailed in most sophisticated ways ... there are tortures and cleansings of whole nations while we are sitting in our cozy little armchairs and giving no sht about that because it is far enough from us, done in the name of us by our civilized army representatives ... and it certainly brings profit and peace to us, we think. Can at least minority of us act against evil only in our dreams, just like Jack? Are we capable of leaving our cozy armchairs for the sake of good? Mr Cameron opens nice questions. As for the SF background of the film most of the scenes look animated, Disney style. The Na'vi humanoid looks like a cartoon character but still fits in the story somehow, could be better for the money spent. Frankly, probably the greatest thing about this movie was marketing campaign. Wow! Compares to that Terminator was zippo. I knew that no movie can satisfied expectations of that hysterical movie marketing but I got more than I expected. All in all, should be seen by both humanoids and Na'vis.",7,1,4,29 April 2010
Stalingrad," Die Beste (The Best)
","One of the best war films I have ever seen, if not the best. It is very hard to talk about such films as it is very difficult to point at any film mistake made. The 'problem' is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of Stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides. This is for the reason that this film unlike the most of Hollywood films doesn't glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead of that, the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti-war as much as the reason can offer. Extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting, most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces. Also, German army is played by Germans which is so convincing as well. The film is produced and realized by Germans where you can see their love for details to perfection. This is the reason why 'Stalingrad' is one of the films I can watch million times and never feel dull. I watched the film with my father who fought in WWII and the first thing he said was: 'This is like real, this is how the war against Germans looked like'. This is the place you can see how did it look to be a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in human history and turning point of WWII: Stalingrad.",10,6,7,31 August 2009
The Wrestler," I don't wanna rain on your parade ...
","I don't want to hurt anybodies feelings here, but I just wonder what is the film reason you can give so high grade to one movie like this? Heartache, heart wrack, heart touching ... that's all nice, we all miss that in a way, but then Southamerican Telenovelas are also deserving 10 out of 10. What about everything else? First of all this film has no plot. The main core of events over here is a Wrestler and his sad life. What suppose to make us nailed to the screen is the mystery if his daughter is going to accept him, is the woman he loves going to be with him and if his sick heart is going to survive all that. I believe that all my neighbors of his age have much more interesting story to tell. And everything about this story is so predictable. Also, Micky Rourke's acting is worst than ever. Did you notice that he has not changed the face expression since the beginning of the movie? Apart from what I think of Mickey Rourke, in this movie he looks like Leather Face from Texas Chain Saw Massacre: there are no mimics, no presence of ordinary acting, no interaction with his surroundings, no energy. Over all, attempt to imply some documentary film elements in the movie is killing it even more because it's hiding some characters and movie dialogs which makes the film even more sterile and dull. If this is what good movie suppose to look like, we got a poor film age coming to us.",2,18,34,4 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Searching for Sherlock
","I grew up reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels and I could still read them. This is because his novels can wake up imagination of the child and yet they have style and class to involve any adult into the story. I can say that this is the case with most of the Sherlock Holmes movies I had seen before I saw this one as they engage you by using the intelligent plot, first of all. 2009 Sherlock Holmes is a ridiculous attempt to turn a legendary detective into a Mission Impossible character and Dr. Watson into James Bond, Sean Connery style. Fast actions with special effects and very poor plot development are typical failures of this sterile Hollywood style project which has nothing to do with Sherlock. As I already mentioned partly, character of Dr Watson overpowers must dominating figure of Sherlock Holmes, which is sooo amateurish. Sherlock Holmes casting is a total failure, this guy matches Sherlock Holmes character as much as Sylvester Stallone. All in all, this is the bad time for Sherlock Holmes lovers.",1,79,153,7 February 2010
Centurion," Funny but cute
","Legions, walking in the woods like primary school scouts, fighting using barbarian tactics more than barbarians, female warriors that are facing legions easily in tactical combat and close combat and women kicking ace of 100 pounds bigger men like in Jacky Chan movie ... all this stuff are decreasing the value of this movie. The other thing that might irritate you are special effects: ridiculous blood splashes in the battles like in some Tarantino movie. However, I found this movie still fun. Camera, costumes and acting are superb. The rhythm of the film is good so the director has overcome the problem of having a dry historical theme movie. What I also liked about the movie is that it shows historical balance as it was: Rome is not the light as in Gladiator but the brutal power that faces another brutal power. However, what this movie mainly keeps away from splendid flicks with of the same topic is lack of secondary plot as in Gladiator for example.",6,4,12,18 August 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Very bad
","I haven't left any comment here for a while but I was so irritated by a very high IMDb rate for this movie that I had to leave my own mark. First of all, the the movie genre is like searching itself through the whole movie. The director wasn't sure is he going to make a horror, thriller, SF or comedy so it looks like he is experimenting with the genre through the movie phases never achieving one whole. Then, the idea of a horror in a controlled environment is kind of eliminating the horror atmosphere and it is very poorly executed. Also, I found the acting of the five pretty pale. Worst thing from my point of view in this movie is that all this is connected into the very boring melting pot where no real plot and no movie dynamics leads you until the end of the movie which I couldn't wait to come.",2,7,15,17 August 2012
Valkyrie," Pale
","This is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in WWII and in history of warfare behind the front line. Bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing Hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event. There is no character development at all and idea that Tom Cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane. I believe that Mister Bin would play it better. Generally speaking, film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good German TV movie 'Stauffenberg' from 2004, but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever. However, movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes Hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values.",2,7,14,31 August 2009
