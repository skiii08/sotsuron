The King's Speech," The King's Speech
","The King's Speech is focused on a King of the United Kingdom, George VI and his speech therapist. They make an effort together to treat George's stammering symptom. Anyway, I was so moved by this film the whole time. First, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are my favorite actors. I love their devotion to performance and especially I was surprised at Colin's precise performance as George VI, who suffered from stammering symptom. Also, Geoffrey's not only gentle but also some times strict attitude to support Colin is so touching. I think the partnership between Colin and Geoffrey is the best of all. After I watched the film, I felt my heart was getting warm.",10,0,0,7 September 2013
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days of Summer
","This story depicts a relationship between a young man, Tom and a young woman, Summer in 500 days. Tom gets to like Summer in spite of her capricious personality.My first impression of the film is that Tom is always twisted around by Summer's little finger, so I thought the story ordinary love story at first. Though their relationship is not true, I was getting fascinated by their performance. Zooey Deschanel performs not only a pretty girl but also a selfish girl very well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also good actor. However the ending of the film is beyond my imagination. I was very disappointed at the ending,but it is a new kind of the ending of love story.",6,0,0,8 September 2013
Enchanted," Enchanted
","This is a comedy and love story that A princess from the animated fairy tale suddenly appears to NY and runs a risk to experience the actual world with her pleasant friends. I think Enchanted has three important elements as a Disney film. First, it has enjoyable music. The characters sing a song and the background music is great. Next is a beautiful and luxurious costumes of the princess. Girls and Women are fascinated by them and they could feel as if they were a princess. Third, Enchanted is a funny story. That is essential to Disney films, so all people watching it can enjoy. Enchanted generously gives people dream, therefore I love this film.",10,1,1,29 September 2013
Departures," Depatures
","Depatures is a Japanese film in 2008. A cellist lost his work, so he gets to work as a mortician. While he is worried about his new job and has trouble with his wife because of hi job, he is gradually matured as a mortician. This film would describe a Japanese beautiful spirit that even after someone's death people should take care of the dead to see them to the next world safely. I am proud of this Japanese tradition and culture. In addition to that, in Depature Japanese beautiful and great nature in the countryside like mountains and rivers appear on the screen. I think all people who watch it can feel and learn Japan more and more.",8,0,0,29 September 2013
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense
","This story is about a boy who can see and talk with the dead and a child psychologist who has trouble about her wife. The boy is isolated because he has the sixth sense that usual people don't have. I think this is not just a thriller film. This is a kind of heart-warming story. The most moving point is that just a little child'strange ability has great mission to tell the truth for people. Moreover, such the child and the adult who has trouble help each other to make up for their fault though there are many terrible and scary scenes the whole time. At the ending, however, I cannot help and stop shedding tears. This is the best thriller film I have ever seen.",10,0,0,20 September 2013
