50 First Dates," excellent film true meaning of love
","This film is one of the best films out, it is definitely a very touching film and has lots of meanings. i have watched the film over and over and it is a film that will never get boring. i think this most certainly shows the meaning of love. Adam (henry) plays a really good part in the films and shows the meaning properly, i don't think the film would be the same if anyone else played the part. Adam is an ace actor! people who think they no the meaning of love should watch this film then think about if they do know the true meaning of love, because i don't think many people actually 100% understand the film and its meaning. This is the best film ever!!!!! 11/10 definitely!!",10,0,0,28 September 2006
