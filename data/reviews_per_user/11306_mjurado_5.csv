Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Biggest disappointment of my moviegoing life
","After the greatness of the original trilogy, this movie was one of the most severe letdowns I have ever seen. To summarize:Darth Maul, who appeared on every piece of merchandise put out for this film, is only in it for about 15 minutes. Granted, his scenes are the best of the movie (the sabre duels), but couldn't we get more out of our villian?Jar-Jar Binks. What can I say that hasn't already been said. He's a cartoon-looking annoyance with no purpose in the film but to act like a moron. He was kicked out of his home for being clumsy, and goes on to be clumy through the entire rest of the film, doing nothing to add to the story or plot, meanwhile being the most annoying character any film has ever produced. A cheap ploy to sell toys.Anakin Skywalker basically does nothing but drive around in speeders and say 'yippee!' Boring, hollow, and flat the whole way through, while doing unrealistic things the highly-trained adult pilots of the movie can't do. Poorly acted, and a boring character.All in all, the script is awful, the acting (with the exception of Obi-wan) is horrid, and often the movie is so boring you may need medical attention. I swear, during the scene at the underwater city I was clinically dead for 2 minutes.This movie is a curse. I just saw Episode 2, and it was excellent - so why was this one so terrible?",5,0,1,17 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Fun and adventurous - welcome back, George!
","**No real spoilers in this review**'Attack of the Clones', basically, is the next series of events in the life of Anakin Skywalker, set against an unfolding chain of events which will become known as the clone wars, and the start of the dark side of the force's coup both on the republic, and on the mind of Anakin Skywalker.As the movie begins, Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to protect Senator Amidala from assassination. The story progresses as the Jedi council uncovers a coming war, as Anakin and Amidala begin to fall in love, and Anakin begins to look more evil and more open to seduction by the dark side of the force.Obi-Wan Kenobi and Annakin are portrayed here as sort of uneasy allies. By this I mean, Kenobi being the wiser, more disciplined one and Anakin being the reckless, often irresponsible protege, not unlike Obi-wan's future relationship with Luke Skywalker. Mace Windu returns from Episode I, and takes on a much more active role; he's a fun character to watch this time around, and a more active participant in the storyline. Jimmy Smits is here too, but his is a bit part no larger than that of Jar Jar Binks. Never fear, Jar Jar haters - he's only in the movie a little bit at a time, but it actually would have been ok to see a little more of him, because unlike Episode I, he's not annoying the crap out of you. New to the saga is Count Dooku, a formidable Jedi master who has already turned to the dark side, and also Jango Fett, whose son (Boba Fett) is still a child at this point.
The landscapes are excellent and engrossing; such contrast exists between the peaceful countryside of Naboo to the busy-busy cityscapes. All are well-done. Unlike Episode I, the special effects here are not overdone, and blend in well with the 'real' stuff. I won't give away any details, but the final sequences are absolutely amazing and more than worthy of any of the previous four films. The cilmax is a little bit James Bond, a little bit of a complex war movie, but all action.For the first time since Return of the Jedi, you sit in your seat in real suspense, and with a tangible anxiety as tense situations unfold on the screen. There is a real sense of adventure here, something noticably absent from Episode I. With the exception of the fabulous portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi by Ewan MacGregor, the acting here is serviceable, but not going to knock you off your feet. The plot is interesting, and keeps you guessing about what might come next. The script generates characters that you honestly care about, and some very emotional sequences, especially one painful and even shocking one involving Anakin's fury on those who have wronged him. There are points in this film where Anakin is not a likeable character, where it's almost like Obi-wan is fighting Anakin's recklessness as much as he is the enemy, it's one of the most interesting aspects of the film.All in all, if you're a fan of the series, you will enjoy this one thoroughly. If you're not a Star Wars buff, but liked the rest of the series, this one isn't going to disappoint you. All I can say, is that it's good to have Star Wars back.",8,0,0,16 May 2002
Spider-Man," Entertaining.
","I was one of those kids who grew up in the 80's watching the spider-man cartoon show and reading the comic books. I guess you could call me a 'fanboy'. Anyway, here's what I think of the film.The movie covers the origin of Spidey, fairly faithfully to the comic books. It was a little odd in some places, to see computers and other high-tech equipment in the scenery for things that happened in the comics in the 1960's. So, the film is set in the present day, presumably to hold the interest of a decidely younger audience.*mild spoilers*The story is the classic Spider-man tale. The lonely high school student, a little brainy for his own good and with a hopeless crush on the prettiest girl in school, is bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result, he is endowed with superhuman powers, the ability to climb walls, the proportionate strength and angility of a spider, and the trademark web-shooting. (in the comics, the web-shooters were a batman-esque tool he wore around his wrists, and har to be refilled with web cartriges sometimes; the web didn't just shoot out of his arm as it does in the film.) Even relatively minor characters, such as J. Jonah Jamison, the newspaper magnate who creates his own news, are faithfully represented and bring a familiar smile to the face of fans of the original books.The story is the tried and true comic book concept. The hero has a nemesis, whom he endeavors to protect the innocent from, and in the end he conquers his for and saves the girl.The film is entertaining, if a bit predictable and campy at times. The effects are nice, though occasionaly look too 'animated'. But, obviously this is a fantasy film, and one needs to suspend reality a bit. Overall, it's entertaining, and if you think you would enjoy the film I'll wager that you will. It's entertaining, very clean by today's standards, and has a couple of good laughs. Nothing really new or inventive, but a good time. 7 out of 10 stars.",8,0,0,6 May 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Visually stunning, a timeless fantasy tale
","Mild spoilers.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a martial arts fantasy tale set in China in the feudal period. It is the story of the legendary warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and his quest to retrieve his powerful sword from a thief. That provides the setting for a number of subplots, including Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and their forbidden love; the Jade Fox, killer of Li's master and to whom Li owes a debt of revenge; and of course the betrothed but rebellious young noblewoman Jen Yu. Part Shakespearean tragedy and a part fairy tale, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a martial arts fantasy film on an epic scale.The story is a tragic one, in the sense that the plot revolves around the characters' being without what they desire, and tragically seeking it. For example, Li's desire to leave the warrior life and live a peaceful existence. Li and Shu Lien's love is forbidden (and similarly, that between Jen and Lo), because Shu Lien was engaged to Li's master before he was murdered. Li's desire to avenge his master by killing his killer. Jen's (the stunning Zhang Ziyi) desire to live an adventurous life as Shu Lien has.
The story is told as it might have evolved as it was passed down through generations, a fantasy tale of sorts about an invincible sword and powerful warriors with a supernatural edge. Some may be put off by the jumping abilities of the especially skilled fighters in the film, but it is important to keep in mind that Crouching Tiger is much like a sort of fairy tale. I felt it lent a quiet elegance to the ancient heroes and reinforced in the viewer the idea of how exalted the warrior caste was in the world of the time. The masterful storytelling aside, it would be impossible to summarize the film without praising the action sequences. The choreography is nothing short of amazing. From the first action sequence, a night battle in a city square and across rooftops, to the best in the film, a confrontation in a dojo between Jen and Shu Lien (with plenty of weapons at hand), the action scenes grab hold of you and don't let go. The symbolic meaning of the sword is also an interesting latent theme in the film. The Green Destiny, Li Mu Bai's powerful green sword, could be a symbol of the characters' own destinies. Li tries to give the sword away as he leaves the life of the warrior, but is unable to avoid its influence. Jen attempts to sieze control of her own destiny through the sword, and Jade Fox is unable to avoid her destiny, which is the sword in a more literal sense. At a first viewing, the sword seems little more than a prop, but each subsequent viewing brings the viewer to appreciate more the role of the sword in the story and what it might be made to represent.A triumph of the genre and an instant classic that blossoms more each time I see it. Definitely in my top 5 films, if not my favorite.",Null,1,2,24 February 2003
Titanic," Great effects, but not enough to save Titanic from mediocrity.
","By now everyone has seen this film, so there's no need to give details. You've heard all the pre-teen girls and middle-aged housewives rave about it. Now, here are thoughts on this film from a male. I don't have a vendetta against this film. Except being dragged to it twice and being forced to see it again on video. Oh, the humanity. OK, maybe I do have a small vendetta.Titanic is visually impressive. SFX are impressive as well. It's really sort of neat to see the whole incident re-created on film. As for the story, Titanic is at the same time a self-important and impossibly simplistic film. Characterization in Titanic seems to be done with a very large club; the dialogue in the same fashion. Don't expect any subtleties here. What you hear from the characters is exactly what is going on. It's pretty much a paint-by-number love/tragedy, and unless you're especially sappy, the dialogue is likely to range from flat and predictable to downright appalling. It reminded me of watching a couple at a junior high dance call each other 'pooky' or something.The old woman at the start and finish of the film is a bunch of boring nonsense. Why waste the viewers' time seeing the heroine as an elderly invalid? No one came to the theatre to see that. They could have at least made her accent match Winslet's.You know the drill, the princess falls in love with the pauper. I'm not totally opposed to the romance picture if it's done well, but this one simply is not. They call each other by name in every sentence. Very annoying. A romance film is only as good as the dialogue and the scenes where you see it all come together. Sorry, but teaching a girl to spit before having her pose nude for pictures isn't really my idea of romance.It's also very clear what Cameron wants you to think. Except for Jack and Rose, every poor person has a heart of gold, and every rich person on the boat is evil and deserves to be, well, drowned like a rat. The passengers are stereotyped so badly the 'rich people being snobs' scenes will likely leave you rolling your eyes. OK, they are bad rich people, and poor people are basically good. We GET it already.I find it puzzling that so much time was obviously spent on the effects, (which were, to be fair, excellent) and yet we get such a basic script that this basically becomes a thinly-disguised, well-targeted effects movie. Effects are great, but can't salvage a poor, eccentric script and below-average performances from its actors.Not much was made about the length of this picture, but I found it to be excruciating. It boggles the mind how Cameron could write the most simplistic script ever, and stretch it out to be so long that you start hoping the !@* damn !@(&$& boat would just sink already!Ahem.Cameron is great - at directing a visual picture. But don't expect him to write a masterpiece. Effects are great, but this film is far, far too long for a script with all the complexity of a coloring book. Visually stunning, Titanic is; no doubt about that. But when it comes to substance, Titanic is all wet.",1,4,10,25 June 2002
