The Blair Witch Project," loved it !!!!!
","see this for suspense, not for gore.  the images incite one's depths of suspense so vividly.  i can't remember being more gripped by suspense since 'the shining'.  if this piece isn't the most ingenious for decades, i'll be surprised.  along with 'dead dogs', it is truly among the best of indies in 1999.  congratulations folks !!!  the 'dogma' group awaits your indoctrination, i'm sure of it.",10,1,2,11 August 1999
