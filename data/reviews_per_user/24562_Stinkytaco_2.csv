The Blair Witch Project," I've seen types of rocks more interesting than this movie
","OK, I'll go step by step to tell you just how bad this thing really is.Camera Work: Horrible! The camera shakes every second! It's so annoying and you can't really see what's going on. Most of the time you'll be skipping parts because of a black screen. You'll wonder: 'Is this important or can I just skip this part?' Acting: The acting is just screaming and yelling and arguing and that kind of stuff. But do these people really need to put a swear word into almost every sentence?Sound: What sound? There is no music except at the end and on the DVD. But it's so stupid. Seriously, the opening sound on the DVD sounds like someone turned up the volume of a keyboard as high as it would go and then sat on it. The music at the end sounds like a dog and a cat ran across the keyboard.Story: OK, so there are 3 kids who go off into the woods to make a documentary about some witch or something. One of the kids gets lost or something. I don't really know what happens to him. So they spend some 3 days in the woods then they go to this house but then the one guy gets lost. The girl finds him like standing in a corner or something. What is he doing in the corner anyway? He's just standing there and the girl flips out and the camera lands on the ground. Wow....Overall: I don't understand why people sometimes force themselves to watch bad movies. Most likely because they want to see if it's worth the 6-8 dollars they shelled out. In the case of the Blair Witch project: To stop watching this film should require as much strength and intelligence as breaking a potato chip. It's BAD. DO NOT WATCH IT. WATCH IT ONCE AND YOU WILL BE HAUNTED FOR LIFE BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT IS!!!! How can a movie just be that bad? It's inhuman! Do not watch it if you value your eyes and ears.",1,2,3,1 October 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Yikes!
","I found this site and I saw this movie a while ago. I saw just a few minutes ago as well.....Why didn't I change the channel? Unlike some people, I have never read the original book. I did see the 1970s film. I LOVED the 1970s film! Everything about it! This one....has just brought shame to it.The good: Errrr.....ummmm....well there was almost nothing good about it except for the beginning. It was OK.....until they went into the chocolate factory.....Words can not describe this....But I will anyway for your sake: Some of the stuff in the preview of the movie before it came out were strange. I didn't think that anything from the original would be in it....but then....Now look! The Chocolate room! Now I remember THAT from the original movie! Not so much..... *Warning* *Some spoilers and a list*The Pipe with the dome around it at the top in the Chocolate roomThe 'Hair candy' in the eventing room.The Dragon Ship thing in the Chocolate river sceneThe FireworksThe song and dance of puppets near the beginning of the FactoryThe Puppet hospital thingThe Squirrel's in the 'Nut room'And the Flash Backs.This film drives itself to the point that it doesn't make any sense after a while. The ending was odd to say the least. Why would you wan't to make Wonka look like the bad guy? It's stupid and annoying. The songs by the ompalompa's were just.......wow.....I couldn't make out ANYTHING they were saying!Next to: Lady in the water, Cat in the hat, and Wild Wild west, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.The final verdict: How this got a score of 7 (See other sites) is just plain scary.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! Even if you are the slight bit curious DO NOT SEE IT!!! I am dead serious......DEAD SERIOUS. Also I would like to add: Next to Judge Doom from 'Who Framed Rogger Rabbit', Wily Wonka in this movie was one of the freakiest characters I have ever seen.Instead of this go see:The original film.Dude Where's my car?DragonHeartor....Jay and Silent Bob strike backThe movies listed above are WAY, WAY, WAY BETTER THAN THIS!!!!Don't bother with it, If you see this in the store don't even touch it.",1,2,6,20 August 2006
