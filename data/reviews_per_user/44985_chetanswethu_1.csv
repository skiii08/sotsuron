Skyfall," Bond James Bond
","Bond is finally back thats it you need to know.......if you have seen the bond series from the start i,e doctor no then this is completely a easy see and you wont be having any problem catching up. But there is a small time-line problem which might be ignored because Casino Royale was a reboot and the time-line of his previous missions might be changed a bit but indefinitely it was hell yeah awesome and Sam Mendes really does some good work rather than the traditional Bond experience. It gives the reboot of characters Moneypenny and Q which I felt was a good touch and awesome actors were chosen for the roles. Some scenes might feel a bit laggy but if you understand English jokes it wouldn't be much of a problem as Damiel is a superb joke cracker.M.Chetan",10,2,17,3 November 2012
