Catch Me If You Can," not brilliant
",This must be one of the worst films i have rented out in a long time. For starters the opening titles were way too long which made me bored before i even started watching the actual film. Even though leo dicaprio played his role quite well i have seen him do better and this must be the worst role i have seen Tom hanks play and i think he's a brilliant actor but i just think this role was not for him.,Null,1,2,23 July 2003
Donnie Darko," Fantastic
",this film was extremely good i had a great time watching this it involved alot of thinking and had you guessing all the way through which i think made it alot more exciting. i must admit i did have to watch it a couple of times to understand it but who would'nt want to being it had the gorgeous jake gyllenhaal in it who i think was the perfect actor for the part.,Null,0,0,22 July 2003
