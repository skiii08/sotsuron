Casablanca," Superb setting
","So far, this movie has the best lighting I've ever seen. Everything worked so well that I don't think I'd have to see the movie in color. My favorite thing about it was how the lights outside of the club worked so well. Nothing was too saturated, and you could tell what was what, and who was who. Even characters who were darker than others were seen well, and that's something big with me. Sure, the movie was a little cheesy but I honestly liked it. Rick's character is probably my favorite, and both he and Lund were extremely good looking throughout the whole thing. It was a bit disappointing that they didn't get together in the end, especially with how their previous relationship affected Rick to become the cold man he was at the beginning of the movie. His development was interesting, and pretty good. The one thing I could say that I didn't like was how everything moved a little too fast for me. Though that in itself is great, a perfectly re-watchable movie. Casablanca had a wonderful setting, a well selected cast and I still can't get over the perfect lighting.",9,2,3,18 October 2014
Taxi Driver," Unusual
","Unusual certainly isn't bad. This movie is just different, and I liked that. One of my favorite things is how they took an ex veteran and placed him back into society, which is a real thing obviously. But what I mean is how he reacts to everything around him, and I find that to be important. It's probably awkward to say, but this movie was tough. The main character was tough, and to see him go to such great lengths for a little girl, it's kinda touching. Violent? Definitely. Kind of perverted? A little, some parts rubbed me the wrong way, and though child prostitution is a real thing, it'll always bother me. That's another important theme to be discussed though, along with veterans trying to come back and make a new life for themselves. The lighting and the effects helped bring this movie to life, and it did really shine for me in the end.",9,0,0,13 December 2014
Annie Hall," It was unexpectedly sad
","Great movie, it was hilarious and I loved the joint perspective of the two lovers. I'm still on the fence about Allen, but he did a great job here. I'm a sucker for 70's movies, and I might like just about everyone I'll see, except maybe romance. Some people say this was a typical love story, and it was, I won't lie about that. But there's something about it that made it work. Was it because Allen's character was weird? Not so much, I think it was the love interest that really got to me, more so in the end with the montage of their relationship and the song. For some reason, that had me a little bit emotional? There was just something about those scenes that had me really feel for the couple. It'd be a typical romance movie, if not for the flashbacks and what not. It's what really made the film for me. Needless to say, the montage at the end was my favorite part, and it's a good watch. I'm not a fan of romance movies, but I'm a small fan of this film, for sure.",9,0,0,13 December 2014
The Graduate," Everyone is having a crisis
","Great movie that had me laughing, even during some awkward moments. The great thing about this film is that it's really done a good job at connecting with the younger audience. I know I'm not male or anything, but I could connect with the main character since I'm a little awkward myself, and when I graduated from high school, everything was beyond me. I was lost and confused, but at least I didn't go down the route he did, which was still wonderful regardless. The wonderful acting was great, because this movie was different in where it didn't follow the flow of most other films, so it was wacky (like with the soundtrack of all things). Fun, wacky and perverted film that spoke for itself, and it's just great. Watching it, I could sorta feel like I was reliving some parts of my life, and remembering other people's experiences as well.",8,0,0,13 December 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Cute Musical
","I'm on the fence when it comes to musicals. I tend to avoid them in general, usually because of second hand embarrassment. Some dancing scenes were a bit of a try-too-hard for me, and some scenes were kind of dramatic, but what do you expect from a musical? It was cute though, especially with how colorful and animated the cast was (you have to be, but these people were touching in a way). Everything was bright and cheerful. The sound was very clear, so some of the songs were able to get stuck in my head after a while, and I have no complaints about it. It's a hilarious and well done movie, and I'd certainly watch it again, but with friends. It's sort of hard to enjoy it by yourself, in a weird way.",8,0,1,13 December 2014
Psycho," DEFINITELY worth re watching, you have to
","Part of me wishes I could have watched this version in color (is there even a version with color? I'm not sure), but it's great without it. This movie does such a great job at leading you on, and just smiling at you once you hit a dead in (such as when you think the girl is the first protagonist, when she's really not). The plot twist at the end was certainly uncalled for, and I enjoyed that a lot. The movie tries to make you connect towards some of the characters, mostly with the son, and I almost went with it. Almost. My favorite scene, probably along with most other people, was the shower scene. Very well done, and I loved the movement, the expression, the sound, it was all working. Crisp and clear, this movie has become one of my favorites in the horror-thriller genre.",9,2,3,13 December 2014
