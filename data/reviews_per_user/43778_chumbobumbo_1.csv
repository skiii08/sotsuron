Skyfall," Underwhelming at best
","The chase on the rooftops in Istambul was first seen in 'The International' (granted, here they are not on motorbikes, but it's hardly original). The chase scenes inside the bazaar are cheaply made (i.e it is obvious they are 'green screen-ing' it). The whole thing would have been better if he was saving Severine instead of 'M' but that's another story. Casino Royale, and Quantum of Solace were markedly better IMHO. The villain is OK (although he was much more convincing in No Country for Old Men, as the script was far more superior). London/Scotland are very dry, uninteresting places for a final face off.",4,8,18,25 November 2012
