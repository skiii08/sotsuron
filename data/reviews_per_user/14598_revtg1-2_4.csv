3:10 to Yuma," Dumb as a box of rocks
","And that means the writers and producers and the director. The supporting cast was great. And their talents were wasted. All through the movie the LAWMEN are running FROM the bad guys. Trying every way they can to avoid a confrontation. The whole story falls apart near the end when the local sheriff and his boys have the perfect opportunity to ambush Ben Wade's gang from upstairs hotel windows (the gang is in the middle of the street below on their horses) but instead throw down their guns and throw themselves on the 'mercy' of cold blooded, sadistic killers. Guess what happens. I could tell you WHY the ending is such a syrupy, sappy, sophomoric crock of dung beetle bait but that would require a 'spoiler.' Let's just say that all through the movie Russell Crowe's character is proud of the fact that he has no socially redeeming qualities whatsoever and then suddenly, almost instantly becomes a saint. Well, that's Hollywood. They made William Bonney, Jesse James, Wyatt Earp and Buford Pusser heroes.",4,2,6,9 January 2008
No Country for Old Men," For GOD's sake, don't waste your time.
","This movie is a waste of time, a waste of film and a waste of talent. The story as acted out is beyond sophomoric, it is dumber than a box of rocks. Beyond improbable, it is implausible. Tommy Lee Jones couldn't even save it. Man comes upon a mass murder scene wherein dope sellers and buyers have shot each other to pieces. Finds one still alive sitting in a truck, bleeding from the chest and asking for water. Finds the one in possession of a million in cash, dead as a hammer, takes the money and goes home. Now, this dirt poor redneck is lying in bed with a million dollars cash at his disposal but is worried about the man who asked him for water. He gets up, gets a jug of water and goes back to the shootout scene in the middle of the night. The backers of the buyer want their money and they are waiting. He outruns a truck, swims a river, chased by a mean dog, shoots the dog, the body of which is the same phony looking fake dog he saw at the murder scene the day before, and goes back home. From there is gets dumber and dumber. There are many things more productive and entertaining you could do than watch this movie. Trying to stack greased BBs would one.",1,14,29,12 June 2008
There Will Be Blood," there will be pointless, asinine movies. this is one of them.
","The English language has its limitations. A sorcerer could not conjure up enough negative adjectives to properly describe this two hour and 38 minutes of film wasted on an absurd and insane movie about an absurd and insane man and the seemingly hapless people he intimidates and berates with his insanity. After the first thirty minutes you began to wonder if the movie will be interminable. Then you realize the answer is yes. And during the endless boredom of its interminability it is fragmented, senseless, pointless, dull, ridiculous and insultingly banal. If you have not seen this movie I envy you. I wish I had not. While watching it you may keep thinking soon, soon it will make sense. A plot, a point, a focus will emerge and there will be an actual story instead of a piecemeal collage of scenes of insane raving and insane acts. The producer and director could have saved time and money by going to an inane asylum and following the most violent and deranged inmate around with a camera. And it would have made more sense.",Null,2,6,8 January 2009
Tombstone," A very entertaining movie and a total crock of horse apples.
","One thing you should see in western movies that you never see is piles of horse apples all up and down the dirt streets. You know they were there but you don't see them in the movies. 'Tombstone' is a video of a crock of horse apples. Wyatt Earp was a brawler, a bully, a pimp, a horse thief. He made his money in Dodge City beating up drunks (at $3.00 a head knock) and keeping the peace in whore houses. That's how he earned the title 'the battling pimp.' He and his brothers were vagrant thugs and bullies. They were cited for the robbery of the Benson, Arizona stage but they had the badges so they blamed it on the Clantons and their friends. Then they closed the case by killing them at the O.K. Corral. One of Wyatt's brothers, Warren Earp, was a drunk and a brutal bully who lived in Wilcox, Arizona. One day he walked into a saloon and got too far out of control and someone shot him as many times as he had bullets. But back to the movie. You know you are looking at a crock of horse apples when Powers Booth's character, Johnny Ringo, stumbles out of an opium den and fires his two six shooters twenty-one times without reloading. According to records John Rheingold shot one man in his entire life. He shot a drunk in the face in a saloon because he didn't like the man's beard. The man did not die. Then in the re-enactment of the famous O.K. Corral gunfight, Val Kilmer's character, John Henry Holliday, fires a double-barreled shotgun three times in less that two seconds. Now you know someone has foisted a crock of horse apples off on you. The only saving graces of the movie are Robert Mitchum's voice over and Charlton Heston's underplayed and unannounced role. But, watch it because it is well scripted, well cast, well directed and a very entertaining crock of horse apples.",Null,1,2,6 August 2007
