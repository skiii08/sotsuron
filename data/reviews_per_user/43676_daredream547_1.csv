United 93," Intense but amazing
","I completely agree with the comment above mine - this movie portrayed the events without making it more dramatic than it really was. I felt like I was a passenger in the plane, and everything was so realistically done it could have been a recording of the real events. It was so powerful, from start to finish. Besides a few gasps from the audience or the occasional sniff, it was silent. And at the end, you could hear a pin drop. I would recommend this movie only if you think you are ready to see it. I knew that I was ready, but throughout the whole film, especially the last hour or so, my stomach was in knots and my muscles were so tense I was shaking. Yet it was an amazing experience. I now can begin to understand what it was like for those passengers. And most importantly, I can appreciate everything that they did, and admire their bravery and strength despite the horrific situation they were thrust into. This movie honors their memory and I truly believe that it is important to never forget what happened that day, and understand exactly what those passengers did for us and our country.",9,4,8,29 April 2006
