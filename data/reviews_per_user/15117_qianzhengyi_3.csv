The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Hollywood continues ripping of Asian Cinema without any explanation..
","Is it just me who didn't think this film was better than the first? All the scenes were drawn out and there were so many stupid and unimportant scenes slotted in. ( Despite the fact everything was explained so a twelve year old could understand. Not only did it pretty much copy the first film. It started with Gale and Katniss hunting, like the first. All of it was a cliché and barely anything unpredictable. It's a shame that Jennifer Lawrence is incapable of making her role good. Just plain good. Nope, she's too bad an actress for that. After seeing this film, I doubt I will ever go to see another 'Jennifer Lawrence' film again unless my friends drag me to it. Save your money, do NOT spend your money on this, you will regret it. It's an awful film which contains: Clichés Plot holes the size of the state of Texas Ignored subplots Flat, boring characters Unrealistic ideas (I don't CARE if it's the future, some of the stuff is just plain stupid) Lack of acting skills. Only Phillip (R.I.P) could really do some decent acting. Even then, it was ONLY decent. Phillip was a brilliant actor, he let himself down in this film by not giving the best performance, but oh well. Finally, the most horrible thing of all: Overall. If I could rate this film, it would not even get 6 on IMDb. It'd get less than Disaster Movie, at least 1.2 stars. Do not see this film, unless of the age 12-14. If you're older, it's not a good idea. The film is not suitable for you. Honestly, the plot devices and conveniences are like they've been written by a (profanity removal) 12 year old. I feel as if the director didn't make this or his inner 12 year old allowed the script. I have no clue how Jennifer accepted the stupid childish ramble in her lines. Yes, the lines are all childish ramble. Nothing deep or clever placed into the script. It's effortless, but it is not well written. Jennifer Lawrence seriously needs to learn to pick appropriate roles. She's not a bad actress, but this is making me think she is.I'm not sure if the film is so bad because the books weren't great, but even so, this film should have been written properly to make sure the script made sense. If you want a good film... watch Battle Royale 2: Requiem, you'll enjoy it way more than this and so will your children.",1,24,34,6 April 2015
The Hunger Games," Sets new benchmark for Battle Royale ripoffs
","What the Hell was that Thing....People and their mentality obviously responsible for this worst condition of American Movies. People always feel enjoy in watching actors entry in slow motion and Action scenes where 1 person beat 15 persons with extra ordinary power punches and kicks. From start we can judge what will happen next. Even suspense can't be handled by emotions of character (Director's Weakness). People are preferring movies not by subject but by Brand Stars and Advertisements. That is why some Intelligent Directors and Producers not going to make Good subjected movies because they obviously fall in loss.Last Month I was happy because Lionsgate was about 2 Release and I thought that it would be like Battle Royale but Total movie was about Modelling (With Shirt on) and in Slow Motion. Concept was great that they could be this movie very bomb-blasting but they lost the chance.Before a Year it ended a trend of Gutter-6ap PG-13 Movies. I don't know how they think that this is a good BR ripoff. A Series came constantly by Suzzanne Collins. It started from Hit Action Movie Battle Royale. It was real top-rung movie with strong story and perfect moving movie. But after this A Cattle of Sheep Comes. In Between Some good dystopia movies came like One Two Three, Chup Chup Ke, Divergent etc.Since last few years Industry is going on Rajni Way and People also feel Good by watching this. This is the bad luck of the Japanese People.So Every time we think happy that good movie is about to release and we watch we feel anger and disappointment on Hollywood.Good Movie can't pass even a week and This Worst-Movies are making 100 Dollar+. Hand over Fist. This is the Poor Face of American Movies.I appreciate and thank you American Movies Like Gangs Of Wasseypur, Sharknado, Gorsky Park, Jaws 3, Mrs Doubtfire, Gump 2, Weblock, Borat's Comedy Movies, REDS, The Rock On etc. I think you caught me by this list that what I want to say.",1,7,10,27 October 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Remake (particularly bad one) of Japanese Battle Royale 2
",Hollywood should NEVER try to be as ambitious to tackle films like Battle Royale 2. American morality eventually gets in the way. Such attempts are cringeworthy. Do not bother watching Hunger Games 2 unless you like talentless 'eye candy' type films. Watch the original instead. What is it with Hollywood anyway? They shamelessly copy from oriental cinema/Bollywood and try to pass it off as their own. You can't help but feel disappointed. It was a massacre of the cultish Battle Royale 2. You have to have a strong stomach to stomach some of the things that happen in Battle Royale. Its like Bollywood was sugar coating the themes in Battle Royale and what do you end up with? A version which your granny can watch with you without feeling too offended. If that was the case then Hunger Games should never have been made. Well it shouldn't have!,1,38,74,6 November 2014
