The Ring," Horribly Predictable
","I don't particularly enjoy wasting my time, especially in a movie theater. That is why I put the two potentially-squandered hours I spent watching this movie to good use. From the cliche beginning to the stupid ending of this film, I found myself thinking of better ways I could have spent my $8 admission money.I found it pretty funny that most of the audience members got up shaking their heads and laughing at the end of this movie. They were probably thinking the same thing as me.(*Potential Spoiler???*)The scene on the ferry was almost laughable. Why, after the horse spooked, did she spend so much time trying to calm the big animal down instead of getting the hell away from it? It would have made the movie better if she had climbed on the horses back. Maybe then the horse could have carried her over the railing as it jumped to its doom.Do I sound bitter to you?How many of you who watched this film laughed out loud when the girl crawled out of the television set near the end? How many of you did not see such a stupid ending coming? Here's a better way the characters could survive when their week was up- stay the hell away from all TV sets! Make a copy, indeed.
Another way this film could have been better would be if the whispering voice on the phone had said, 'One weak-ass movie'. If they had shown that during the TV spots and trailers for this film, I wouldn't feel so cheated now.2.5 out of 10 Only because that kid gave me the willies.",Null,0,0,22 October 2002
Black Hawk Down," Buy a history book
","There seems to be an overwhelming number of complaints from viewers regarding a lack of historic background provided with this film. To those who feel this way, I have a question: do you need a brief history lesson at the onset of every war film? This movie has been compared for whatever reason to Saving Private Ryan. In that film, Steven Spielberg did not find it necessary to explain the motivations of Hitler after the opening credits, nor did he feel it necessary to explain why the soldiers involved with the story were there in the first place. Most every human being that may have seen that film knows enough about history to understand what was going on there. Yet this film is looked down upon by people too caught up with getting their history lessons from Hollywood because it lacks some sort of long-winded overview of the events leading up to 3 October, 93. In my personal opinion, this is one of the best movies ever made. It's too bad it's based on a point so low in American history that most Americans did not even know that it took place.",8,0,0,28 January 2002
