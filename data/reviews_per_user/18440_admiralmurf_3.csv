Black Swan," Almost perfection
","When I first told my university friends that I wanted to watch Black Swan, I was responded to by being called 'gay'. Despite this, I went to the cinema to watch it with old school friends, as was not disappointed despite all the hype this film has been given. It turned out that some of the scenes in the movie make it quite far removed from being a 'gay' movie. In short, the movie is a very well made psychological journey, similar to that of Fight Club, although it somehow manages to avoid becoming a clich√©, notably for me by not adding a cheesy flashback reel at the end to show 'what really happened'. It is also worth adding that the film never attempts to hide the fact that a lot of the events, or at least what we are allowed to perceive, all happens in the head of Nina Sayers, the protagonist.To add a very brief synopsis of the story, an eager and hardworking, but innocent, ballet dancer lands the role of the white swan and black swan in a new version of Swan Lake. During the film, Nina is taken along a psychological trip where the pressures of being 'perfect' for the role often distorts what is really happening through very creepy hallucinations, where she eventually completes a change of character and 'becomes' the black swan. Although the makers deny that this is a comment on the world of ballet, I think it is clear for all to see that the primary purpose of the film was to do this.It is very worth pointing out that Natalie Portman's performance in this film was mesmerising on so many levels. Firstly, the traditional acting element of her performance is done with a great level of skill. She starts the film with a really innocent and vulnerable look in her eyes, and ends it being the evil black swan, all of which can be read directly from her face. Praise for this level of subtle acting is important and must be credited greatly. Then there's the dancing. Not being a ballet expert myself (in fact I have only ever seen a short segment of a ballet live in my life), it is hard for me to give a detailed comment, except what I could see through my ignorance. To paraphrase one ballet expert, Portman pretends to be a dancer very well. Naturally, she was never going to pick up the technique that people spend their lives learning and get it completely right, but she does a very good job at it. If I had not known that she only spent a year learning, I would be happy to accept that Portman had been dancing for her entire life if I was told. For me, the overall level of acting in this movie, traditional and dancing combined, this is truly one of the better performances I have seen in film.Some of the feedback from the world of ballet was that the film was an inaccurate portrayal of the world of ballet, to which the film makers responded in agreement, as mentioned earlier. However, I think the world of ballet would try their hardest to disguise the truth if it was the case, so I encourage people to draw their own conclusions. I would argue that Black Swan has actually helped the industry, since my friends and I, and probably I high percentage of people that watch the movie, are now keen to watch Swan Lake to see it in its real form.This is the type of movie that I would be happy to give a 10/10, although this would devalue the true greats. As a result, Black Swan gets one less.",9,3,5,23 February 2011
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Very good for a comedy
","This movie is one of my favourite comedies, of its type. I have watched it more than a few times now, and it never gets old. The characters have great depth and are thought through, which can become uncommon in comedies. It's funny from the very start, and is the perfect combination of comedy and love.'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is basically the tale of a melancholy man who's famous partner, Sarah Marshall, breaks up with him, and by complete chance, they end up going on breaks to the same resort in Hawaii. This provides a brilliant setting for all sorts of funny events.The soundtrack is wonderful, it is worth mentioning. You'll find yourself searching for some of the songs online after watching just to hear them again.Overall, I would say this is a brilliant feel-good comedy. The sun of Hawaii and the very funny characters will more than brighten up your day.",8,0,2,23 February 2011
The Fighter," Definitely a good movie, but nothing past that.
","The Fighter was the type of film that intrigues every boxing fan and cinema goer. You look at the film and think 'it's about boxing, it is critically acclaimed, nominated for several Oscars, and is a true story'. However, I cannot deny that I did feel let down by this movie, as it definitely did not live up to expectations.As a brief synopsis, The Fighter tells the story of 'Irish' Mickey Ward's rise to become a champion against the odds, and his brother Dicky Eklund's addiction to crack. First and foremost, this isn't exactly a typical boxing film; it's more about the intra-family relationships around the brothers and, even more importantly, the relationship between the brothers. This is all that is really worth saying about the story to people that haven't seen it.The acting in the movie is definitely a split between the good, the bad, and the ugly. To get it out of the way, Mickey Ward's family cover the 'ugly' side of this. Now, to begin, Mark Wahlberg is his typical wooden self in this role. Perhaps the only reason he got this role was because he could provide muscle? The only redeeming feature is Christian Bale as Dicky Eklund. Especially to people that have seen the roles Bale normally plays, this will be a surprise. The performance is a joy to behold, especially during the credits when the real Ward and Eklund speak and you see how close to the real thing Bale got. Apart from his impersonation of Dicky Eklund, Bale plays a crack addict very well. There is a particularly moving scene of Eklund rolling in agony whilst he is incarcerated for numerous charges brought about for raising money for his brother, due to the withdrawal symptoms caused by not having crack in prison.Story-wise, the movie is okay. It is not the most spectacular storyline you'll ever see, but this can always be excused when a true story is being told. However, most boxing fans will know Mickey Ward for his saga of fights with Arturo Gatti, none of which are shown in this movie, since it ends after he becomes champion. This was a little bit disappointing, but I guess it feeds into the fact that this is more a story of love and family than a boxing movie.Whoever gave the filming tips or artistic direction of the movie can be saluted. I personally thought it was a great idea to switch to more of a television camera for the fights to make it more realistic. Otherwise, nothing to exotic is used through any of the normal scenes. The only other thing I would add is that I personally thought the text used over the screen looked very amateur, but it isn't the most important factor in a film.Overall, I think this is definitely a good movie, but nothing past that. The nature of the film and the hype it is given makes me feel a sort of pressure to give it a higher rating. However, anything past this would undermine the quality of better movies.",8,0,0,23 February 2011
