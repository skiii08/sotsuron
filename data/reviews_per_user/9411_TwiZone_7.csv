Vertigo," In my opinion, 'Vertigo' is Hitchcock's best film!
","I've seen a total of 18 Hitchcock films since I started watching his films this year, and I've enjoyed all his works. I've been impressed with a good number of them, but after watching 'Vertigo' for a 2nd time, I now believe this was Hitchcock's best work, and hence, his true masterpiece. The direction, the style, the story, the visuals, the atmosphere, the soundtrack, the performances are all fantastic. I think it might be James Stewart's best performance out of all the films I've seen him in. Kim Novak also did a great job. Many Hitchcock films I've rated a 9/10, but in my opinion, this one deserves a 10/10! It's in my top ten favourite films of all time!",10,2,5,25 September 2013
Your Name.," Makoto Shinkai's magnum opus and one of the most intelligently written pieces of entertainment Anime has to offer
","I had high expectations for Your Name. Not only because I have thoroughly enjoyed Makoto Shinkai's previous films, but also because it has been doing incredibly well at the Japanese box office the past few months.While I think Shinkai's previous films are great, none of them quite reached masterpiece levels for me, but I'm very happy to say that Your Name did that, because not only is this without a doubt Shinkai's best work to date, this is easily one of the best Anime films I have ever seen.I don't want to go give away too much detail about the plot, but all I will say is that this is an incredibly written and very original story, with fantastic animation (as you would expect from Shinkai), along with lovable characters, funny humour, a great music score and a final act that will surely have you waiting to see what transpires with deep emotional investment.What starts off as a funny body-switch comedy turns into something much more deeper and emotional in the 2nd half, but I won't give anything away!It's now one of my top 5 favourite Anime films and I encourage everyone, regardless of whether you're an Anime fan or not, to check out this masterpiece.",10,8,12,27 November 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A very impressive superhero film. It rivals the Avengers.
","I thought Captain America: The Winter Soldier was superb. I think it's 10 times better than the first Captain America and I really liked the 1st film. The action, suspense, epic scale, its fast-pace, the twists and turns and just the sheer entertainment value of this film was brilliant to me. This is some of the best action Marvel has ever made in my opinion.In my view, this is the best Marvel film released to date; even better than The Avengers. I was really impressed by it. Obviously, I don't want you all to be disappointed after what I said, but I really do have a strong feeling most of you will really enjoy this film once you get around to it.I would give it a 9.5/10.",9,7,15,26 March 2014
Knowing," A criminally underrated film
","First off, I'm not going to say that I think 'Knowing' is one of the greatest films ever made, nor do I think it's a perfect film by any means as it does have a few problems, but overall, I've always really enjoyed this one. I love the cinematography, the atmosphere, the tone, the premise, the score and especially the tense moments scattered throughout this film. Sometimes, it pays not to listen to what others say and instead watch a film and come to your own conclusions. For me, I always got a fair amount out of this film compared to a lot of others. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it's one that I always enjoy. I would give it an 8/10 overall.",8,2,5,16 December 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," An incredibly entertaining piece of cinema
","I absolutely loved The Desolation of Smaug. I loved An Unexpected Journey, but this is several times better. The action was awesome, Smaug was awesome and menacing, it's darker and faster-paced than the previous instalment, Legolas and Tauriel were fantastic, the dwarfs are great, more is at stake and overall, it was a thrill-ride from start to finish. It gets a 10/10 from me and I have to be really impressed for me to rate a film with a perfect 10. Some critics and people are still complaining about certain aspects of the film. Ultimately, they are entitled to their own opinion, but for me as a film-goer, I was completely satisfied. I cannot wait for There and Back Again, especially after that cliffhanger! I highly recommend it!!",9,3,9,16 December 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," This film is unlike anything I've ever seen
","I watched this film for the first time a few days ago, and after the impact it has made on me, I felt compelled to do a review. What can I say about this movie? The music, visuals, and imagery are just perfect, (not to mention the chilling HAL 9000).The visuals is the best aspect of the film. From the tranquil view of outer space, Planet Earth, the spaceship, the planets and the psychedelic colours towards the end, this really is visual film-making at its best, and it's mind-blowing, considering it was done in 1968! I still wonder how the team behind the visuals did those effects they're that good!! It's a shame that the original Star Wars films always comes to people's minds when thinking about great visuals that came out a few decades ago, when in fact 2001: A Space Odyssey really should get the credit in my opinion, especially considering it came out 9 years before the first Star Wars film. The music is also wonderful, creating a chilling, eerie and sometimes unsettling atmosphere to the film. It truly fits with the very serious tone of this film.More can be said about this film, but I don't want to reveal too much information, so watch it with no interruptions or distractions, and just absorb everything that is shown in the film and enjoy it.Unfortunately, as much as I love this film, I feel that it is not for everyone, as some people might get a little bit confused or even bored by the film, but, this is a film that doesn't have a coherent and easy- to-understand storyline that everyone can grasp, and it's not meant to, as Kubrick wants the viewer to think and contemplate on what he sees, and to come to his own interpretation of the film. In my opinion, the ambiguity and cryptic nature of the film makes it fascinating to watch. If you keep this in mind, I hope you will enjoy the movie immensely, as I did!After watching this film and really thinking on it, this is my No. 1 favourite movie of all time. I'm 19 years old, so I believe even the younger generation can enjoy and appreciate this masterpiece.'2001: A Space Odyssey' gets a perfect 10/10 rating from me!",10,1,3,19 February 2013
Castle in the Sky," My favourite animated film of all time
","Laputa: Castle in the Sky is my favourite animated film and it happens to be my 3rd favourite film of all time. I have seen all 11 of Miyazaki's films and I got to say, this is my favourite by far. I love practically everything about this Anime. The music score, animation, characters, story, humour, creativity and just the sense of adventure and fun are all amazing and create one of the best, if not the best animated film to have ever been made in my opinion. What's also wonderful is the atmosphere. There are some scenes with no dialogue, but the music, animation and the scenery allows you to take in the mystery and wonder that the film and the world it's created has to offer. Castle in the Sky has everything you could want in a film. Even if you don't like Anime, you have to see this film!",10,2,2,13 August 2014
