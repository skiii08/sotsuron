It," Low budget... very disappointing total waste of time
",Shocking how bad this movie actually is. The build up to it made it out to be really good yet it's more like a low budget Poundland movie. The original movie was by far better and scarier. The actors are rubbish and the clown is pathetic. If it was possible to leave no stars i would. Very disappointing waste of time doing a remake to have made it this bad:(,1,5,14,20 September 2017
