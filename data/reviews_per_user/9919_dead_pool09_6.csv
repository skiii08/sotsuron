Angels & Demons," Open the doors, and tell the world the truth.
","amazing. a GREAT movie, excellent thriller. well worth the price of admission. much like the negative reviews of X-Men : Wolverine, you MUST NOT listen to the reviews. I'm anxiously awaiting a (hopeful) sequel from Mr. Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. It Also had a great musical score in the film. And It was composed by Hans Zimmer, so if you are a fan of his, this is a double-entente. In My Opinion, the only score done by Hans that outdoes this is 2008's The Dark Knight, though i can draw certain similarities to both of the film scores. so, Yes, you should see this movie. the catholic church has gave this film unfair press, so do not let that persuade you either. it's just a movie.",10,4,10,14 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Highly Underrated...
","and this is coming from a huge fan of star wars BEFORE the prequels. These are all the same thing..cheesy dialogue? yup, the OT had that too...bad acting? I fail to see it...Music? Once again, an overly exceptional score by John Williams as always..the prequels aren't perfect by any means, but the hate for them is absolutely ridiculous. These are the backstory to Lucas original ideas. whether you hate them, that is your opinion, but this was Lucas' original intent, and for better worse, this is what they are. For those who say he raped your childhood, well, I guess that sucks for you, but let those who aren't little babies enjoy these. Another solid addition to the Star Wars franchise. 9/10",10,69,106,6 January 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," amazing, don't listen to the poor reviews
","I'll keep this review short & to the point - this is action packed fun right from the very get go.the cast is perfect, the film's soundtrack kicks major ass, and Ryan Reynolds was born to be dead pool. At first i didn't have high expectations, but i didn't have low ones. I wish dead pool could been in this a tad longer, but then again, this is wolverine's origin movie, not dead pool the movie.and the new designs for the characters is actually to me pretty cool. The final confrontation at the end was worth the ticket price alone. Oh, and make sure to stay during and after the end titles..there is something special there for you...now, stop reading this, and go see it!",10,5,11,29 May 2009
Spider-Man 3," The Best Of All Three.
","a great and underrated movie that's got too much hate for whiny and prissy fan boys. what they fail to understand is that this was (before it made super-serious bank at the BO) gonna be the last spider-man movie, so things needed to be tied up nice and neatly in the end. though, as good as it is, thats not to say it's perfect. wait for the DC of it.Either there's whining about how much Spider-Man 3 sucked, how much Sam Raimi sucks, how much Venom and Carnage rule, how ugly Kirsten is,how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, how much Spider-Man 3 sucks, reboot, reboot, reboot etc...GET OVER IT. Topher Was a great choice for Eddie/Venom, a slimy character, Thomas Haden Church was great as the sympathetic sandman/Flint,and Tobey/James/Kirsten all reprise there roles better then ever. As For The Music, it was amazing. Young adapted Elfman's themes very well (remind me again WHY THERE Couldn't BE A SCORE SOUNDTRACK ALBUM WITH YOUNG'S MUSIC???). Although, I will admit, there is some unnecessary things, but what movie doesn't have that? I eagerly await part four. 10/10",10,2,3,20 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," this is a highly underrated movie - along with the other prequels
","and this is coming from a huge fan of star wars BEFORE the prequels. These are all the same thing..cheesy dialogue? yup, the OT had that too...bad acting? I fail to see it...Music? Once again, an overly exceptional score by John Williams as always..the prequels aren't perfect by any means, but the hate for them is absolutely ridiculous.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My FAVORITE of ALL the star wars.
","this film was INCREDIBLE. I LOVED every minute of it. the music, the action, the special effects, you name it, I loved it. Music? Once again, an overly exceptional score by John Williams as always..the other two prequels aren't perfect by any means, but the hate for them is absolutely ridiculous. These are the backstory to Lucas original ideas. whether you hate them, that is your opinion, but this was Lucas' original intent, and for better worse, this is what they are. For those who say he raped your childhood, well, I guess that sucks for you, but let those who aren't little babies enjoy these. Another solid addition to the Star Wars franchise that I will cherish for the rest of my life. 100/10",10,2,4,6 January 2010
