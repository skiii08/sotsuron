1) Some concepts are similar to the previous movie: another treasure hunter with his violent men, the protagonists become hostages, the FBI fails to catch them.
2) The main characters are extremely lucky.Debatable holes:
1) Ben ridiculously knew everything at the perfect time.
2) Riley could hack everything, even the Buckingham Palace and the White House.
3) When there was the chasing in London, the police did not do anything.
4) Abigail luckily was in a relationship with someone important from the White House. That person was also luckily easy to engineer.
5) They were able to infiltrate the White House that did not have proper security.
6) Connor believed that Abigail's earring was lost in the Oval Office.
7) Connor should have heard the sound of Ben doing something with the desk.
8) The president agreed to discover the secret tunnel during a party with only few guards.
9) The security during the president's birthday party was weak.
10) How did Ben know about the secret tunnel at Mount Vernon?
11) The event organizer could not find any places other than Mount Vernon. They should have prepared long time ago with backup plan. They could also have special access for venue.
12) It was very lucky that the president was about to have a party at the time Ben needed to meet the president.
13) It was so convenient that the president was very kind to Ben.

7) A fun adventure and hilarious movie.
8) The special effects and visual effects are superb.
9) The action scenes excellent.Debatable holes:
1) The Royal Navy soldiers could not fight properly. They always lost and never used their guns.
2) Jack easily stole the chalices from the Spanish Navy. There were no guards at their camp.
3) Why were Jack and Barbossa loosely tied near each other? No one was guarding them and no one was pattolling.
4) Why did Syrena help Jack by giving the chalices?
5) The main characters never had an injury from any fights.
6) How could the Santiago stay balanced when only Barbossa entered the ship?",6,0,0,10 May 2020
The Incredible Hulk," The amount of destruction is perfect. It is better than the 2003 version
","It is perfectly synchronized with the 2003 version, this movie somehow continues what the 2003 version started. Good music, production set, design, action scenes, and props. Some visual effects are great, but some Hulk's effects and green screen scenes need improvement. It has the same feeling with the 2003 version, the military, gamma radiation and anger, Betty and her father, chasing and destruction, but this time, it has equal opponent and more smash. Good casting and performances from Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination. Great casting and good performance from William Hurt as Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross. General Ross and Betty did not do anything significant at the end of the movie. The fight with Emil feels incomplete and the fate of Emil is not clear. The relationship between Bruce and Betty is well-done. It is quite boring in the middle.",6,0,0,22 June 2020
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The movie could have been shorter
","An interesting novel story. The visual effects and special effects are okay. The music and costumes are perfect for the movie. Isle Esme is amazing. The wedding scene is gorgeous. The actors and actresses did okay job.Debatable holes:
1) How could Alice's power work on Bella?
2) After the baby was born, Bella should have been in agony, she should have not even be conscious.
3) How could the Cullens control themselves when Bella was drinking blood? How could they even possibly control themselves when the baby was being born?
4) Edward's clothes were covered in blood when the wolves came, how could Jasper and others control themselves?
5) No one was hurt after the fight between the Cullens and the wolves. Were they hesitate?",5,0,0,19 May 2020
Iron Man 3," A good movie, but it could not anticipate the hype after the Avengers
","The writing is good, it has cool moments, surprising elements, and quite disappointing parts. It is a good follow-up of the Avengers, and once again the Iron Man starts another phase. It is clear that Tony is heavily impacted by the New York event, because he was the one who closely finished the battle. It is understandable why Tony has so many enemies from the way he treats and acts disrespectfully towards people. We see Tony being vulnerable, threatened, and anxious, but we also see that he is a genius and resourceful inventor. His relationships with Pepper, Happy, and Rhodes are strengthened through the conflicts that personally impact them. The inclusions of the President, the Vice President, and Harley Keener are not desirable, but Tony's relation with Harley is well-done. The Mandarin twist is very clever, although many people dislike it very much. The character growth, villains, and humor are well-done.The casting and performances are good: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow as Virginia Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as James 'Rhodey Rhodes/Iron Patriot, Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery, and Paul Bettany as JARVIS.The production set, costumes, make-up, visual and special effects, props, tone, action sequences, and music are well-done.",8,0,0,27 June 2020
Iron Man 2," It is nice to see the MCU starts growing
","Good writing, music, production set, props, visual and special effects, costumes. The action scenes are cool, especially the fight between Iron Man, War Machine, and the Hammer drones. Natasha's fight choreography is cool, but it is not believable that they were easily defeated. Good casting and performances from Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as James 'Rhodey' Rhodes/War Machine, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, and Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson. The way they connect the movies in the MCU like the post-credit scene is so brilliant. Tony's friendship with Rhodey and relationship with Pepper are well-done. Robert successfully portray Tony as a genius, inventor, and technologist.",7,0,0,23 June 2020

7. A fun, hilarious and thrilling adventure.
8. Gore Verbinski did amazing job.
9. The special effects and visual effects are awesome, especially the Kraken and Davy Jones.
10. The action scenes are super.Debatable holes:
1. Will was so lucky to find someone who was willing to take him to the Black Pearl. He was also so lucky to find someone who had found the Black Pearl.
2. How could Pintel and Ragetti set sail on a small boat? How could they luckily find the Black Pearl?
3. After the Kraken attacked the Black Pearl, all the main crew and only them survived.
4. How could Davy Jones not find Will when he was running away? He was floating on the sea and hiding on Jones' ship.
5. How could Norrington safely arrive at Port Royal?
6. Davy Jones could just defeat Jack and his crew easily by teleporting to the Black Pearl once again.",8,0,0,9 May 2020

8) Gore Verbinski did amazing job.
9) The special effects are successful, the visual effects are also great, but could be improved for the skeletons.Debatable holes:
1) When Jack and Will were trying to commandeer HMS Interceptor, they used a boat underwater. How could there be air void?
2) When Barbossa attacked HMS Interceptor from the Black Pearl, the main characters were luckily unharmed, although they were greatly outnumbered and not perfectly armed.
3) The Royal Navy officers were too innocent, unskilled, and passive.
4) When Barbossa's crew attacked the Dauntless, how could there still be many Royal Navy officers left? They were fighting violent immortal pirates.
5) Isla de Muerta was easily found.
6) The smoke signal made by Elizabeth was easily and quickly discovered by the Royal Navy.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Truly fantastical, a wonderful introduction to Narnia
","Great things about the movie:
1. Beautiful introduction to Narnia, the story is interesting.
2. The practical effects and make-up for centaurs, minotaurs, fauns and dwarfs are realistic and detailed.
3. The production design and locations are perfect.
4. The scenes where Narnians fight Jadis' army (third act) are epic.
5. Pevensies' armor and Jadis' 3 costumes (white ice, black sacrifice, hunting armor) are very cool.
6. Perfect cast, good acting and voice acting: William Moseley as Peter Pevensie, Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie, Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie, James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, Ray Winstone as the voice of Mr. Beaver, and Dawn French as the voice of Mrs. Beaver.
7. Liam Neeson as Aslan is perfect; Tilda Swinton is unforgettable as the cold witch.
8. Great lessons: sincere sacrifice; completing, helping and believing in each other as family; loyalty and hope.
9. Beautiful score and music.The animations for beavers, wolves, fox, griffins and giants need to be improved.Debatable holes:
1. When the wolves were looking for the Pevensies and interrogating the fox, they should have been able to discover them from their smell, because they were just a few metres above.
2. The other wolves should have been able to attack Peter and friends from behind during the waterfall scene. Maugrim was not brave nor confident enough to attack Peter (twice), although he was the Captain of Jadis' police force and Peter barely knew how to hold a sword.
3. When Aslan was going to sacrifice himself, there should have been guards around his camp.
4. The time for Aslan's additional army to go from Jadis' castle to the battlefield was too short, considering that it was pretty far.
5. In the final battle scene, Oreius was frozen by White Witch and broken into pieces. However, during coronation scene, he could be seen.",7,0,0,29 April 2020

","Great things about the movie:
1. The action scenes are amazing.
2. The visual effects when the dagger is used are excellent.
3. The acting is good, from the main and supporting characters to the villains. Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, Ben Kingsley, and Alfred Molina do good job.
4. The production design is well-made.
5. Costumes and properties are visually interesting.
6. The music makes the action scenes and adventure even better.The resolution does not fit perfectly. The animations for the Hassansins, the snake, and some landscape scenes are not smooth. The main characters are mostly whitewashed, unfortunately.Debatable holes:
1. Dastan and Tamina were very lucky, they were barely injured.
2. If Alamut's defense was known to be very formidable for years, than it should have not been breached that easily.
3. The Dastan, Nizam, Tus, Garsiv , and Tamina did not have guardians at all, although they were princes and princess.
4. People who could actually fight are only the main characters.
5. Sheik Amar and Seso changed their heart too easily to help Dastan and Tamina.
6. Hassansins were known to be fierce warriors, but they could not even defeat Sheik Amar and Garsiv's people.
7. It was unclear why time rewound to the moment Dastan found the dagger.
8. Dastan was a superhuman, he was so durable, strong, fast, lucky, healthy, fit, and had high stamina, power and energy.
9. How could the snake swallow the dagger?
10. The enemies did not kill the protagonists whenever they could and they were easily distracted.
11. The characters easily found each other with little effort, whether it was in a crowded village, a vast dessert, or any locations.

Spider-Man 2," Spider-man really had hard times
","The movie successfully show the struggle of being a superhero, especially in the shoes of Peter Parker, who has so many things to take care. His clash with Doctor Octopus is one of the best hero-villain clashes. The action scenes are terrific, because Spider-man and Doctor Octopus' fighting styles are unique. Their battles are awesome, especially on the train.Mary Jane Watson is a selfish gold digger who puts Spider-man in danger (due to her relationship with Peter) and breaks Peter & Harry's friendship. She decided to be with Flash to get the privileges from the relationship, such as being protected by the school bully himself; she decided to be with Harry to enjoy his wealth; she was interested to Spider-man because he saved her life; she was interested to Peter because he was her only friend; she decided to be with John Jameson because he is a famous, successful, kind and brave astronaut; she hugged and kissed John when she was actually thinking about Peter; she decided to marry him although she did not want to; and she left John a few seconds before the wedding ceremony started, then she went straight to Peter's place in wedding gown, kissed him and told him she loved him.The great: Story, plot, action scenes, character & emotional development, production design, music, visual effects (except the sun), villain; casting and performances of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus, Rosemary Harris as May Parker, and J.

Blade," How vampires + action should be, although the villains must learn how to fight.
","Perfect casting: Wesley Snipes as Blade, N'Bushe Wright as Dr. Karen Jenson, Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, and Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler did amazing job. The action scenes, properties, and music are awesome. It is very cool to see Blade does the fight using his gadgets and guns.The visual effects are so weird. Some special effects are too much. The vampires could not keep up with Blade's strength and skill. Violence, gore, pain, torture, blood, and scars are abundant in this movie, which make it less enjoyable. But perhaps people would say 'what do you expect? It is an R-rated vampire movie; not just a vampire, it is Blade.'Debatable holes:
1) Blade held a bleeding cop and tried to shoot at him, but the people around did not do or realize anything.
2) Karen did not get hurt, not even a single shot hit her.
3) How did Frost find Blade?
4) When Frost encountered Blade on the street, the people around did not realize or do something.
5) When the girl fell on the street, the bus did not try to stop. No one was affected by what happened.
6) When Blade was around the street, no one even realized or noticed.
7) How did Frost find Blade's place?
8) How could Frost arrive at Blade's place before Blade on the street?
9) After Karen saved herself, she easily took a gun and no one saw her. The enemies did not guard the place properly.
10) Karen easily found, saved, and freed Blade.
11) After being bitten, Karen was able to stand, think, talk, walk, shoot, and fight.
12) How could Blade kill a vampire using a bone?
13) The enemies should have shot Blade using a silver bullet.
14) Frost's men could not even land a single punch/kick or shoot Blade.
15) Injured Karen easily defended herself and killed a fit vampire.
16) Why were the other pure-blood vampires afraid of Frost?",5,0,1,24 May 2020

The other characters are interesting but not deeply explored. The time travel is tricky.

Good casting and performances from Morena Baccarin as Vanessa, Julian Dennison as Russell Collins/Firefist, T.J.

The other characters are well-cast and performed, especially Bruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly and Anna Paquin as Marie D'Ancanto / Rogue. The story, villains, action scenes and powers usage are well-done, but Jean Grey and Storm could have done more with their powers, they are obviously depowered.

Spider-Man 3," A beautifully made movie about friendship, romance, revenge and choices
","Although the villains, main conflict and message are not as strong as the previous movies, this is still a recommended Sam Raimi's Spider-man movie.There are so many characters and plots in this movie. Love triangle with our best friend is hard, especially when both are our best friends. The presence and spirit of Uncle Ben is still emotionally preserved. The romance between Gwen Stacy and Eddie Brook is unnecessary.The good: Visual effects, production design, music, villains, action scenes, costumes, property; character development, motivation and actions; casting and performances of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Harry Osborn/New Goblin, Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/Sandman, Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom, Rosemary Harris as May Parker, J.

2. How possible could the opera singer destroy the bulletproof glass with her voice?
3. The chance of survival of Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock on the ship, on the seaplane, on the lifeboat, on the dessert, and during chasing scene in Bagghar was tremendously high, with no injury.
4. Tintin's house was accidentally very close to the port, therefore Snowy was able to keep up.
5. When Red Rackham's ship was stuck with Sir Francis Haddock's, it was too heavy to swing above Haddock's ship.
6. When Sir Francis Haddock was trying to escape, no one was guarding. When he was setting the ship on fire and fighting Red Rackham, no one woke up.
7. How could Sir Francis Haddock survive after he destroyed Red Rackham's ship? How could he know the coordinate of the drown treasure?

9. The destruction in Bagghar was massive, how could it be easily solved?
10. How could Tintin and Captain Haddock attend the The Milanese Nightingale? There should have been invitation and heavy guards. Captain Haddock and Tintin did not wear proper clothing. When Captain Haddock was making a mess, guards should have started securing him.
11. If the miniature model of the Unicorn was very valuable, how could it be sold in an outdoor market for just 1 pound? Could the seller not understand the value? How could it be there in the first place, because it was supposed to be given to a Haddock only?

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fresh and interesting, with a surprising twist

Wesley Snipes as Blade and Kris Kristofferson as Abraham Whistler did great job. The other characters are interestingly cast, they did good job.Debatable holes:
1) Whistler too easily defeated Dieter Reinhardt and freed himself.
2) How could there be a secret connected tunnel that connected the place Whistler was held to Blade's? He easily found, figured it out, and used it.
3) How did Whistler shot Damaskinos's lawyer from the tunnel?
4) Whistler easily saved Blade without the enemies noticing.
5) How did Nomak find out about Damaskino's place?
6) What was Damaskino's plan? Did he think he could protect himself from Nomak using regular methods? Why did he foolishly kill his Bloodpack members? Did he not have other vampires to fight and protect? If so, why did he sacrifice the only fighters he had?
7) The lawyers' soldiers stupidly shot and attacked Nomak and Blade although they knew it would not affect them at all.
8) Blade's glasses was not broken.
9) Blade's endurance and strength were extraordinarily unlimited.

7. The audio effects are well done.Animations for humans and the facial expressions look unnatural.Debatable holes:
1. The way the flying ticket was blown against the wind, got stuck on a window, and formed a snowball felt not so real. It also should have had wrinkles after being eaten by a bird. But for the sake of magic, it worked.
2. The hero boy should have not survived when he was on the roof of the train. But for the sake of magic, it worked.

","Jon Spaihts, Scott Derrickson, and C. Robert Cargill's writing and Scott Derrickson's directing are great.

","It is quite funny and interesting. The writing is okay but quite messy. The villain is generic and his power is uninteresting.The casting and performances are good, especially Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne, and Michael Douglas as Hank Pym.

Captain America: The First Avenger," Beautiful introduction to Captain America's mythos
","It is well-written, successfully introduces the character, makes it relevant and lovable. The movie is reminiscent of 1990's Captain America movie, but the MCU version definitely has more depth and is perfectly tailored. The villains, character development, character growth, the friendship between Steve & Bucky and the romance between Steve & Peggy are well-done. Joe Johnston successfully does his job. Abraham Erskine's vision about and words to Steve Rogers are moving and beautiful.The casting and performances are splendid: Tommy Lee Jones as Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Sebastian Stan as James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, Neal McDonough as Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan, Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine, and Toby Jones as Arnim Zola. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America is perfect, he has the physique and aura.The production set, costumes, props, music, make-up, and music are beautiful.

Salt," Jolie as a secret agent is amazing
","The story and twist are interesting. The casting is perfect. Great performances by Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, iev Schreiber as Theodore Ted Winter, and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peabody. The scene where Salt killed Winter is my favorite.Debatable holes:
1) Peabody and others should have been able to shoot Salt when they surrounded her before she jumped onto a truck.
2) Salt got into a hotel with guns. Did the hotel not have metal detectors?
3) How could Salt know the exact timing and location of the Russian president's speech? How could she know the underground way to the church?
4) The security around the church was weak, although they were American and Russian presidents.
5) How could nobody not see Salt when she got out of the police car?
6) The other Russian agents did not hear Salt killed her boss.
7) The other Russian agents were too easily killed and defeated by Salt.
8) How could they not detect the bomb brought in by Shnaider?
7) Salt very easily defeated all people who were protecting the US President. The security system was weak and easily breached.
8) How could the helicopters not able to find Salt after she jumped out of the helicopter? She could not hold her breath, stay underwater, and swim to the shore for that long. They could have just waited.",6,0,0,14 May 2020

Spider-Man," Well-accomplished and beautiful Spider-man's origin story
","Sam Raimi had a great power and a great responsibility, and he used it very wisely and he did it very well. I like the portrayal of the main characters. The character interactions are well-done. Uncle Ben and Aunt May are very lovely and their love to Peter is generously depicted. Uncle Ben's message is incredibly powerful: 'With great power, comes great responsibility'. The scene where Peter and Uncle Ben talk is really emotional.The great: Story, plot, production design, villains; character development, motivation and action; perfect casting and amazing performances from Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker, Rosemary Harris as May Parker and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.The good: Casting and performances of the other characters, especially Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and James Franco as Harry Osborn; Spider-man's costume is great, but Green Goblin's costume is unreasonable; the special effects are great, but some visual effects need improvement, like the explosion that kills Oscorp's board and when Green Goblin is flying with his glider; action scenes, property and worldbuilding.",7,0,0,6 June 2020

Dr. Curt Connors' decisions to destroy things, kill people, infect the city, become a supervillain and suddenly help Peter from falling off the Oscorp building are not explained and developed very well. Uncle Ben's death is not as emotionally strong as Raimi's, but it is still beautifully depicted.The great: Amazing visual effects, production-design, action scenes, special effects, costumes, music; character development, motivation and actions.The good: Casting and performances of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard and the other characters.",7,1,1,7 June 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," The best movie from the Wizarding World franchise so far: Truly fantastic
","The visual effects, production design, properties, costumes, music, story, casting, acting, and actions scenes are absolutely fantastic. The creatures are not only gorgeous, but their relations to the main characters and uniqueness are well integrated. The leading roles are well-developed and introduced. The romance between Jacob and Queenie and the friendship between the four main characters are well-done. The world-building, magical spells and presentation between human and witch/wizard world are successfully depicted. The conflict, resolution, twists, and seeds for future movies are perfect. The tone, comedy, action, and warmth of the movie are successfully crafted by David Yates. Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein, and Colin Farrell as Percival Graves performed wonderfully. Katherine Waterston as Porpentina 'Tina' Goldstein, Carmen Ejogo as Seraphina Picquery, and the rest of the cast did good job.Debatable holes:
1) No one, not even the guards, were at the Central Park besides Newt and Jacob.
2) The erumpant did not encounter any human or witch/wizard during its outbreak.
3) Queenie easily saved Jacob from having his memory erased. They also easily took Newt's suitcase.
4) Only No-Majs who touched the rain had their memory erased. What about those who do not? What about digital proofs such as photograph, videos, and live reports on TV?",8,0,1,23 May 2020
Twilight," Fan-service for the novel lovers (maybe) & romance lovers
","I like the scene where the Cullens play baseball, the Cullens' house, the family bond of the Cullens. The music and costumes are good enough.Bella as a character is very stiff, awkward, and flat. Jacob's character is totally useless. All the characters are underdeveloped, including Bella, her friends, Charlie, the Cullens, the werewolves, the villains. Their backgrounds and motivations are not explored. The Cullens just run fast, pose, and push. The romance between Edward and Bella is forced, and it exists for the sake of the movie.Debatable holes:
1) The Cullens are obviously vampires. Common people should have figured it out from their appearance and habit.
2) The people should have been more familiar with vampires. If they could access the internet, books, or tales about vampires, then they were either brainwashed or never read about it.
3) Why Edward wanted Bella so much? What was so special about her? What had she done to Edward or the Cullens? What made her different?
4) Bella's friends were only presented at the beginning with so little background exploration.Bella's friends only introduced their names.Then, the situation was inverted. It was all about the Cullens and Bella's friends were gone. Bella did not even say hi to them when she went to school with Edward.
5) Why James wanted Bella so much that he would risk his life?
6) How did James know about Bella's old ballet studio?
7) Why should Edward suck the venom out of Bella, not Carlisle?
8) How did Carlisle know that Bella's blood was already clean? How did sucking blood would ensure that the venom was sucked out?
9) Bella did not find it disturbing that Edward stalked her.
10) Why could Edward not read Bella's mind?",5,0,1,18 May 2020

6) Representation aspect is well-done.Weaknesses of the movie:
1) The scene where St. Peter's Basilica was falling looked odd.
2) Scenes where the characters just stand and look in awe at a coming disaster when they should actually do something or run away are very annoying.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Everything is rushed & too good to be true: characters, story, action scenes
","Great things about the movie:
1) The visual effects are mesmerizing.
2) The production design, costumes, make-up and properties are wonderful.
3) I appreciate the performances of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem as Captain Armando Salazar, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa, and Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, although not as great as in previous movies.Weaknesses of the movie:
1) The story is not really interesting. The plot is weak, complicated, and coincidental.
2) The characters are not as interesting as in previous movies. Their introductions, development and roles are not done properly. Henry Turner and Carina Smyth are unnecessary additions, and the villains (Salazar, the Royal Navy) are not as compelling as before, in terms of story and portrayal.
3) The action scenes are boring.Debatable holes:
1) As always, the Royal Navy soldiers were ridiculously incompetent.
2) Why did the people accuse Carina as a witch? She did not do, look, or act anything bizarre. Although common people were ridiculously stupid, I could not understand their accusation. Not to mention the Royal Navy's hatred towards her.
3) In a world where magic, Kraken, ghosts, and curse existed, why did people in this movie (like the Royal navy crew and Carina) not believe in such?
4) The bank robbery was ridiculously not believable. The horses should have not been strong enough. The bank should have not been that mobile.
5) The execution of Carina and Jack could not be done properly.
6) How could Jack and his crew get away from the robbery? Why could the army not catch up?
7) Salazar could have just killed Jack easily when he could control water.
8) Why were Salazar and his men cursed? What did it have to do with the compass? How did Salazar know that it was the key to let them out of the zone?
9) How could Henry get away from the triangle zone?
10) How could Gibbs and the others get away from the British Navy ship?
11) How could Henry find Gibbs and the others to save Jack? Why would they even care? How could Henry find the money?
12) Why did Barbossa not let Carina to lead them in the first place? He, as captain, used starts to guide him.
13) Why were the people not familiar with astronomy? There was a shop with telescope.
14) Recurring characters did not seem like they aged.
15) It was too lucky that Henry, Carina and Jack could cross path, in terms of motivation, mutual goal, and relationship.
16) Carina could lead the way, but she did not have to steer.
17) If Salazar's army could not die (unless by standing on land) then how could anyone fight them? At least people who fought them got injured severely.
18) When Jack was forced to marry, how could the people be there? How could they had had experience with Jack?",5,1,1,10 May 2020
X-Men: Apocalypse," Too many characters and the moviemakers cannot control/use them wisely.
","An unnecessary apocalypse. I cannot believe that Days of Future Past and Apocalypse are directed by the same person. Great visual effects, music, production design, props, costumes and make-up. Very bad story, villains, conflict, motivation, actions. Disappointing action scenes. I like it when Quicksilver saves the X-Men from the explosion.Disappointment: Magneto's motivation to be villain. Apocalypse as the villain, his motivation and inability to use his powers or win. Angel's motivation. Psylocke motivation. Mystiques as a hero and an X-Men. Cyclops and Jean's romantic relationship. Xavier's inability to use his power. Storm's casting, acting, motivation. Nightcrawler's role, casting and appearance. Havok being killed. Moira, Jean, Cyclops, Beast, Stryker and Logan's roles. Xavier being naive about humans. Mutants cannot control their powers. Magnet's indecisiveness about his stance. X-Mansion easily destroyed and rebuilt. Xavier is powerless.

Unfortunately, we would never see the continuity of this universe. Peter's relationships with Gwen and Aunt May are well-portrayed. However, Max's character who turns into a supervillain, trying to kill everyone and destroy the city, is not clearly understandable. Max and Harry turn their own problem into a personal matter with Spider-man, which is not well-depicted and developed. Electro and Harry's characters and portrayal are not favorable.The great: Amazing visual effects, production-design, action scenes, special effects, costumes.The good: Music, character development; casting and performances of Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy.The bad: The villains' motivations.",7,0,0,7 June 2020

Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Billy Burke as Charlie Swan, Michael Sheen as Aro, and Dakota Fanning as Jane did good job. The visual effects and special effects are okay.The movie is too long with so many scenes where the characters just stare at something or Bella thinking/crying, or just pure silence and the camera moves around. The motivation of Edward for loving Bella is still not clearly developed, unlike the relationship between Jacob and Bella.Debatable holes:
1) How could Jacob save Bella on time when she jumped into the water? He was far away, how would he know about the location and that it was Bella?
2) Jacob did not know how to perform the chest compression. How could Bella be so lucky to survive? She was drowning for quite a while.

The Fantastic 4 must cooperate with Doom to save the world from destruction, in which he himself has his own agenda.The teamwork of Fantastic 4 is fantastic. That is the best thing this movie has to offer. The design and appearance of Galactus is too bad: a powerless hungry giant cloud. The relationship between Ben and Alicia is more lovable than Reed and Sue's. It is nice to see Doom again, but it was not his full potential. His armor is cool, but he should have worn a green cape instead of black.+ The good: The Thing's make-up; The visual effects of Invisible Woman & Human Torch's powers, the Silver Surfer and his board, Galactus and the destructions; the production design, music, villain, action scenes; the teamwork, emotional and character development of the Fantastic 4; casting and performances of Ioan Gruffudd as Dr. Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Susan Storm/Invisible Woman (at least better than the first movie), Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne as Norrin Radd/Silver Surfer, Julian McMahon as Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom, Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters, and Andre Braugher as General Hager.<ul><li>The bad: The visual effects of Mr. Fantastic's stretchy power and the FantastiCar; the costumes of the Fantastic 4 and Doom are not improved; more action scenes are highly expected.</li></ul>",6,0,0,1 June 2020

Avengers: Age of Ultron," As an Avengers-level movie, this is disappointing, especially from a director who created 2012's the Avengers. Just throw many superheros, villains, explosions, and destructio
","It is quite complicated and hard to follow. For a comic-book superhero movie, the overall story is good, but some parts especially in the first half of the movie do not click so well. Tony's motivation, decision, and reasoning to create Ultron are terribly disappointing, he exactly sounds like a super-villain, just like Ultron in the movie. It is too bad that Tony's character is treated that way, because he is supposed to be wiser. Ultron as a villain is interesting in his own way, but it feels like the character, his motivation, powers, and existence are vague. How he could be created, what he wants to achieve, what he is capable of, how he could be defeated, and how he could think, talk, and act the way he does are confusing. The villains are too many. Using Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, Dr. List, the rest of Hydra, Ulysses Klaue, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch as the only villains, in which the last two would then turn heroes, would be much preferred and more relatable. This movie does pick up where Captain America: the Winter Soldier left off, but the time-skip makes it not connected very well.The casting and performances are well-done: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man (although Tony's character is very cringe in the first half), Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Don Cheadle as James 'Rhodey' Rhodes/War Machine, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch, Paul Bettany as J.A.R.V.I.S. and Vision, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon, Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig, James Spader as Ultron, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Claudia Kim as Helen Cho, and Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue.

Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge is a great addition to the movie, the character successfully makes me hate her. This is the most emotional movie so far, especially between Harry and Sirius, his parents, Voldemort, and his friends.The visual effects need improvement. During fighting scenes, the villains look like they are holding back.Debatable holes:
1) How did they know that Harry used magic in front of his cousin? If they could find out, how about Hagrid in the first movie, the flying car in the second movie, or when Harry inflated Aunt Marge Dursley?
2) Hogwarts students sometimes hate Harry, love Harry, trust Harry, call him liar, bully him, or adore him according to the plot.
3) Could they use some kind of magic or potion or plant or object to see Harry's past in order to prove him that he was totally innocent of using magic in front of his cousin? They could use truth serum.
4) Could the prophecy be used to predict Voldemort's arrival?
5) If the students could not even perform expelliarmus, stupefy, or any basic charms, what did they learn then? Even the Weasley twins could not do anything or serve as a teacher for Dumbledore's army.
6) If Voldemort-level threat was coming, why did senior students of Hogwarts not do something?
7) Harry had more experiences in heroism, but his magical skills was almost at the same level as other students.
8) How could Harry and friends get to London so easily and fast? They even got into the Department of Mysteries very easily without anyone noticing.
9) How did Bellatrix know about Nevile?
10) The Death Eaters could not defeat nor harm the children.
11) Lucius could have easily taken the prophecy from Harry.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," I was eager for the final battle, because everything else was so so. But then, the final battle was not as expected.
","The music, score, tone, opening and end credit sequences, and casting are perfect for the movie.The visual effects are okay, but Bella's first hunt scene does not look smooth. The action scenes are not as expected, the Volturi holds back. Most of the conflicts are unnecessary and underdeveloped, because they are only caused by misunderstanding or lack of self-control. The vampires gathering and Volturi's visit are just for the sake of the movie, because it could easily be solved through a fair trial or discussion. The final resolution was weak, because the Volturi just leaves, although they bring huge army. Since the final battle is only Alice's alternate vision, it undercuts the risk that the movie offers. The imprint is interesting but is not sufficient to solve the conflicts. The emotion of almost all characters in the movie is very unstable.Debatable holes:
1) Why did the Volturi have to wait for few days to come to the Cullens?
2) Baby Renesmee did not have vampire features, like eyes, fangs, skin and body temperature, or constant physical need for blood.
3) How could Bella hold herself when Charlie came to the Cullen's? Baby Renesmee also did nothing when she was on Jacob's arms or near humans.
4) For convenience, the Cullens easily have the wealth and easy access to airplane ticket and housing furniture.
5) If the Volturi was some kind of government for the vampires, why did they not have system for crime reporting, fair trial, discussion, proof gathering and validation, and trustworthy members? The members only acted based on their instinct and emotion.
6) How could Jacob know that the 'uninvited' vampires were uninvited? What about the Amazonian ones?
7) Bella ridiculously easily control her desire for human blood.
8) Edward could have easily read Alice's mind.
9) How could the vampires control themselves when Jacob was in the house? How could the 'food' be sustainable and enough for all?
10) How did all vampires know about Carlisle's intention to gather witnesses? Did he called them? Why did they need to travel, then?
11) How could Bella have the defensive power when she was in human form? Could humans have powers as well? How could the power be so random and extensively powerful, like controlling elements?
12) Why was Bella so special that her power was always active even when no one realized it and she did not know about it?
13) Alice's vision could change, but it never happened. It was too convenient for the Cullens.
14) How far could Alice see the future? What were the constraints? Did she always have to watch the one she was trying to sense? How many people could she sense at the same time? Did they have to be in certain range?
15) When Carlisle's vampire friends and family went back, the Volturi could just attack the Cullens easily.
16) What did the Volturi want exactly? What were their job and responsibilities as 'Volturi'?
17) In the battle, the Volturi could defeat the Cullens and friends very easily. Jane's pain ability could be very effective.
18) Sometimes, a vampire could easily break another vampire's head/limbs easily, but sometimes, it is not the case.
19) Why was immortal child so dangerous? Why could the vampires not able to restraint/train it? What made a regular vampire child and an immortal child different?
20) Why would Irina not tell her assumption about immortal child to her family first? Why did she not ask for explanation first?
21) Why did anyone think that Renesmee could pose a threat?
22) Why did Alice and Jasper have to go secretly?",5,0,0,20 May 2020

7) The visual effects are well done.Debatable holes:
1) The password for the preservation room was extremely weak.
2) The security system during gala dinner was very weak.
3) The gift shop clerk thought that Ben took a souvenir copy, which he did not. It was either Ben intended to take a souvenir copy in the first place or the clerk did not scan the souvenir copy bar-code.
4) The enemies always failed to hit their targets.
5) Why did Ian decide to go to Boston alone without taking Ben? He barely got enough clue.",8,0,0,2 May 2020

1. The production design is outstanding. It successfully makes the viewers feel that they are part of Titanic.
2. The visual effects are great, especially the technical aspects of Titanic.

5. The character development and roles in the movie are well-done. Each character contributes to the movie and overall story.
6. 'My Heart Will Go On' by Céline Dion is phenomenal.
7. A masterpiece from James Cameron.The visual effects for some scenes are not completely perfect. I can see that it is just green screen, like when Jack and Rose are at the bow.",9,0,1,29 April 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Magical movie, very entertaining for family and children
","The music, casting, character interaction, tone, properties, costumes, production design, and world-building are perfect. Great performances by Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy did great job.The visual and special effects need improvement, although some are gorgeous. The final conflict, final resolution, and actions taken or not taken by Hogwarts teachers are weak.Debatable holes:
1) Harry and friends found the troll long before the teachers did.
2) Why was Gryffindor's seeker position vacant? Did they not have a senior student for it?
3) Harry and friend's detention was at Hagrid's? It was too convenient for Harry.
4) The students were asked to go to the Forbidden Forest, although they were strictly forbidden to do so.
5) Hagrid left Harry and Draco alone in the forest.
6) During Quidditch game, Hermione got to the other side so quickly and unnoticeable.
7) What made Harry so special to be a seeker?
8) Hagrid was conveniently too easy to spill things out from his mouth. How could he be trusted by the teachers?
9) Why where there a broom in the room of flying keys?
10) Why could the flying keys not be able to attack Harry and friends?
11) Harry easily spotted the key to open the door.
12) Harry easily got the key to open the door.
13) How proficient was the magical chess? It was easily defeated by children.
14) Professor Quirrell could not even defeat Harry. He could have easily killed Harry with a spell.
15) How could Professor Quirrell easily get into the final room? Did he set the trap?
16) If Professor Quirelle had been in the final room before Harry and friends arrived, how could the key still be outside the chess room?
17) The House Cup point system was subjective. There was no system that regulates how a point is taken or given, by who, and for what actions.
18) If Professor Quirrell's action could lead to extreme danger (Voldemort got free), how could the teachers not do anything about it?",6,0,0,20 May 2020
Thor," Interesting introduction to Thor's mythos
","The writing is okay, but the characters are too many. The Warriors Three and Darcy Lewis could have been written out. Volstagg, Hogun, and Fandral do not do much, their powers and skills are inferior to most known characters in the MCU so far, and their relationships with Thor are not so close. Darcy Lewis does not do much as well, her contribution to Jane's project or for Thor's problem is not significant and her relationships with any other characters are not explored. The root cause of Asgardians and Frost Giants' conflict should have been explored more, along with the latter's background and intentions, because they are only introduced as the bad guys. The character development and character growth are well-done for Thor, Loki, and Odin. Thor is completely arrogant and annoying at first and this movie explores his growth to be humble and selfless. In the end, Loki's motivations and actions are very understandable for what he has been through. Thor and Loki are the only ones who maximize their powers, especially the latter's mischievousness. The Frost Giants are definitely depowered.Some casting are good, some are so so. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, and Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson are well-cast and their performances are good, especially Anthony Hopkins. Thor's banishment scene is very cool. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Idris Elba as Heimdall are good, but they would shine much more in the future movies. Casting Natalie Portman as Jane Foster is okay, but her performance is not compelling in some scenes, because she acts like a fan-girl of Thor.The production design (Asgard, the Mjolnir site, and Jotunheim), costumes, props, and music are beautiful. Most action scenes are disappointing (SHIELD agents, the Warriors Three, Frost Giants, battle with Destroyer, the final battle with Loki). Some visual effects are gorgeous (like the colorful skies, Bifröst, Asgard), but some look fake, like the Destroyer. The sound editing is not smooth and accurate enough. The bright tone is good, but it is uncomfortable when the scene suddenly changes to night time. The Frost Giants' make-up and effects look good.",7,0,0,24 June 2020
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The movie is too long, and the complicated story is not really convincing
","It is a great story for a novel, but for the movie, it is a bit complicated, which caused the movie to be so long. The cast did okay job. The flying car and ghost effects, costumes, production designs, and properties are well-done.The visual effects for Dobby and basilisk among others need improvements. Hermione as the only student who knows everything is too much. Harry and friends do all the work, no senior students, teachers or staff did anything to help or could figure it out at all. The main characters are always so lucky and everything always happens at the right time and at the right moment for the sake of the plot.Debatable holes:
1) When using the Floo powder, what would happen if there are two places with the same name? If there are multiple fireplaces at the destination, which one will be used?
2) Hagrid found Harry at Knockturn Alley at the exact moment he needed help.
3) How would someone know that there is someone at the other side of Platform Nine and Three-Quarters?
4) How could Ron have the car key?
5) How could Harry and Ron arrive at Hogwarts using the flying car? Is it connected to London King's Cross railway station?
6) How could Dobby put a spell at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters just in time? Was he around there at that time? How could he catch up?
7) When a teacher gives a house points, who writes it down? How does the teacher know about the student's house? Do they remember every student?
8) If a student could get point just by simply answering a question, then it should apply to all actions taken by the students.
9) How could Gilderoy Lockhart the new teacher know the students' name?
10) If the professor could easily lose his wand from Cornish Pixies, how could he become a teacher in the first place? Hogwarts as the best magical school should be questioned.
11) Why were all classes at Hogwarts so dangerous and destructive? Did they not have teaching methodology, system, and curriculum?
12) Why did all students except Harry, Hermione, Ron and Nevile, left the class when the Cornish Pixies were causing trouble?
13) When Harry and friends found Argus Filch's cat, why did Argus, and then the students, and then Dumbledore and other teachers come together just in time?
14) For this movie, only teachers relevant for the movie showed up, just like in the first movie. Except during dinner, of course.
15) It is unfair for heads of houses to be able to give or take points.
16) Audiences and players could die from playing Quidditch.
17) They should have stopped the Quidditch game when the ball was out of control. They did not do anything when it destroyed the stadium. They did not even do anything when it almost killed Harry.
18) Dobby almost killed Harry few times.
19) How could they blame Harry Potter just because he was at the crime scene? Hogwarts is an educational institution, not a drama club.
20) What is required to cast a spell, exactly? Does someone should think about the spell in its mind? Say it out loud? Sustain eye-contact with the object? Need a wand or just hand wave? How could magical object be sentient? How could magical spell be active all the time without eye-contact from the one who makes it? How is someone chosen to be able to perform magic?
21) What does being a member of a house actually mean? Does it teach or give something to its members? If a certain house is bad or good, why is the system still applied? No other houses have been highlighted so far except Gryffindor and Slytherin
22) How could Crabbe and Goyle be stupid enough to eat a flying cake? If it was flying, then of course it was spelled. They should have known it, except those 2 characters were more stupid than Dobby.
23) How did Harry and Ron know that Crabbe and Goyle, and only the two of them, would come out of the room, see and eat the cake without thinking with no witnesses? How did they hide the bodies?
24) Hermione did not lock the bathroom door when she was turning into a cat.
25) Hagrid suddenly found Harry and friends when they were talking about him.
26) Dumbledore and Fudge came just in time before Harry and Ron. They did not see them at all. What made the problem so important that the minister himself have to come to Hagrid's house without assistance?
27) When Harry and Ron came out from Hagrid's house, no one saw them.
28) Why did recovering the petrified students take so long?
29) If the problem could cause someone to die, or even cause Hogwarts to shut down, why did the teachers not form an investigation committee and do something? The senior students could have done something too.
30) How could Gilderoy Lockhart be a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher? Was he not tested and selected?
31) How could Harry easily open the paths to the Chamber of Secrets? How did he know about what to say? Could someone with no ability to speak to snakes open the chamber?
32) Before Harry, Ron, and Lockhart entered the chamber, they should have called the teachers. No one even realized that they found the chamber.
33) The cave-in surprisingly separated Harry and Ron, with Harry on the side leading to the chamber.
34) How could a memory have a body and be tangible?
35) How could Tom manipulate Ginny?
36) If Tom was just a memory, how could he know about recent events?
37) How could Fawkes come just in time to save Harry? How did it know the location?
38) The basilisk should have easily caught or defeated Harry.
39) A piercing sword should have not easily killed the basilisk.
40) Could Tom perform a magic spell? He could write his name using the wand.
41) What proof did they have that Hagrid was sent to Azkaban?
42) Once again, Hogwarts, the best magical school could not even stop another Voldemort-level threat, but 3 young students could. In fact, the teachers were in their way and people were accusing them of terrible acts.
43) What was Tom's intention after realizing the basilisk?
44) Lucius should have been sent to Azkaban instead, because he was the real culprit. There were witnesses that he put the diary at Ginny's basket: Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys.
45) How could the basilisk survive for so long? What did it eat? The chamber's exit was not only the entry way.
46) How did Dobby know that Harry was in danger?
47) What danger could possibly harm Harry, as mentioned by Dobby?",5,0,1,21 May 2020

","Good story, plot and villains' great visual and special effects; good production design, action scenes, powers usage, costumes, make-up, music, character and emotional development; Magneto's costume at the end of the movie looks weird and does not fit with his character; great casting and performances, especially James McAvoy as Charles Xavier/Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Good casting and performances, especially Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert, January Jones as Emma Frost, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw, Jason Flemyng as Azazel and Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy / Beast. Jennifer Lawrence is okay as Raven Darkhölme/Mystique, but she does not have Mystique's aura and her character is different from how she should be.

Cyclops is still depowered and does not do anything significant. Jean Grey uses her power very well only at the end of the movie. Jean's decision to sacrifice herself is very questionable and irrational, it is done so only for future movie plot. Mystique's plan to release Magneto, Magneto's escape scene, Wolverine vs Deathclaw, Nightcrawler teleportation scenes and Storm's tornadoes scene are all so cool.",7,0,0,12 June 2020
Thor: The Dark World," It needs more Asgard and cosmic stuff, less Jane and earthly things
","The writing is okay. It is nice to see the developing relationship between Thor and Loki, the Warriors Three, and Lady Sif. The Warriors Three and Lady Sif's roles are well-done, unlike in the first movie. Jane, Erik, Darcy, and Ian's involvements are unnecessary. The villains, the Dark Elves, are generic and uninteresting. Loki's mischievousness is once again well-portrayed. The culture of and everything in Asgard are so beautiful, the movie should have focused on Asgard and other beautiful realms (but not dark and lifeless ones) instead of earth.The casting and performances are good: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Christopher Eccleston as Malekith, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster, Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis, Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Zachary Levi as Fandral, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, and Rene Russo as Frigga.The production set, costumes, music, visual and special effects, make-up and props are beautiful.

Fantastic Four," It is fun to watch this incarnation of the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom
","5 people go to space for a science project and have their genes mutated due to a disaster that grants them superpowers. Some try to fix the new normal while some use the opportunity to gain advantage. Doom uses his power for evil intentions and it is up to the other 4 to stop him.If Fantastic Four mythos was science that kids should learn, this movie is the elementary school. The plot where they fight Doctor Doom comes a bit late. The movie focuses too much on Reed and Sue's relationship, Johnny's fame, and Ben with his unsure acceptance of his appearance. Reed is a thinker, but not a genius-level intellect. Victor is dangerous, but not Dr. Doom level-dangerous. The movie should have shown more effective and interesting usage of the superpowers.+ The good: The Thing's make-up; Invisible Woman & Human Torch's visual effects; the production design, music, villain, costumes; okay action scenes; the relationships and interactions of the Fantastic 4; character development and motivation; casting and performances of Ioan Gruffudd as Dr. Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Julian McMahon as Victor von Doom/Doctor Doom.<ul><li>The bad: Mr. Fantastic's visual effects.</li></ul>",5,0,0,1 June 2020

Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen, Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black, Peter Facinelli as Carlisle Cullen, Ashley Greene as Alice Cullen, Nikki Reed as Rosalie Hale, and Jackson Rathbone as Jasper Hale, and Anna Kendrick as Jessica Stanley did good job.The relationship between Edward and Bella escalates is still not well-built due to lack of strong foundation, unlike Bella and Jacob.

The scenes where Mumble was chasing the ship and when he was in the glasses room are very emotional, powerful, and my favorites. There are two aspects of the movie that are very different: the musical and dramatic aspects of the movie that are friendly for family and kids; and the criticism for human's involvement that affects penguin's life.
