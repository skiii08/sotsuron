The Avengers," Took it Seriously
","In terms of quality, I would compare 'The Avengers' to 'Superman' starring Christopher Reeve, i.e. Absolutely no hokeyness whatsoever. The story was superb, the writing crackled with energy, and the acting was excellent. I thought that that the pacing was magnificent - suspense actually increased as the story proceeded and the perils became more and dire and catastrophic.Each actor and actress seemed to me to be utilized to the optimum not only in terms of their skills as characters, but, moreover, in terms of their thespian skills. I thought that the movie was a real tour-de-force, a sort of how-to-really-do it, beckoning sequels of similar high quality to follow, I hope.I was relieved and glad to see Josh Whedon make full use of Liam Hemsworth as Thor, something I thought was sadly lacking in Hemsworth's first venture in portraying the Viking god. Mark Ruffalo finally gave us the first truly satisfying Hulk since Lou Ferrigno! Even Scarlett Johannson's Black Widow, with ample opportunities to overact, to ham it up, utilized her minimalist skills to allow the audience to interface with the story. In the final set pieces of the movie, Downey and others also played down what was roiling inside of the characters' minds and hearts and souls -allowing the audience, once again, to interact and participate - as opposed to being dictated to or oversold on the emotions. For a fantasy and a superhero movie, that is quite a feat. Not only does Josh Whedon deserve tremendous credit for that result, but also Jon Favreau and Stan Lee - among others - The portrayal of Loki was on a par with Shakespeare's Iago, a character who takes great glee in being purely evil.",9,3,7,11 June 2012
The Monuments Men," Convincing sleight-of-hand
","Actors are professional pretenders. Movies that depict real life events, or literary works,are successful if they present persuasive indications, hoping to capture the spark of reality on stage or screen.George Clooney is a sentimental man who conceals his sentimentalism well. He makes movies whenever he can about topics, people, and issues he cares about.Having read the book this film was based upon, I was looking for gestures, expressions, persuasive indications of a movement most people, including me until very recently, were not aware of.A story in today's Wall Street Journal proclaimed that the desire to save, protect, salvage and restore, and allow the present and the future to continue to enjoy art - is ongoing - even in such places as Afghanistan and Iraq. That article also dramatized General Eisenhower's efforts to ensure that American soldiers were respectful and appreciative of other countries' cultures and their artistic and other achievements.I thought that the exposition, the part of the movie that was slowest moving, where each character had to be introduced and developed, then inserted into the rather tense and nervous camaraderie, such as it was, was the weakest part of the film; but even this part had the feel of a recapturing of the mis en scene of 1944 global Armageddon in the world.I often forget that many of the Chicago group that made Saturday Night famous: John Belushi, Bill Murray and many others, were classically trained actors. Bill Murray listening to a record while in the shower is a great moment in theater, in acting, in verisimilitude, the art of making the gesture, the moment, seem so real that the audience forgets it is only a movie.The entire cast behaved as if they truly were the architects, curators, sculptors, and connoisseurs they were portraying, and I felt that the movie got stronger and stronger after the going got really tough in their mission.Kate Blanchett plays a tough French woman smoldering with an inner burning anger, and she is convincing in every scene she was in. I thought that she inspired and uplifted Matt Damon's performance.I think the quality of the writing is uneven, but that is true not only of art, but of life. Sometimes, ordinary people utter mundane statements; sometimes, we are inspired to be eloquent, elegant. I think that 'The Monuments Men' captured that reality, too.I would love to see it again, and I urge anyone who is interested in the idea of saving precious works of art from military and other predators, to read the book by Robert M. Edsel.",8,76,137,8 February 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Connoiseurs May Relish This Trek
","Connoisseurs of 'Star Trek' may fall in love again with tribbles and Khan Noonian-Singh. Those not familiar with Star Trek will still enjoy this stand-alone story which doesn't even require the audience to recall the first of J. Abrams' resurrections, with much the same acting crew, in 2009.I first watched James Tiberius Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. Bones McCoy, Scotty, Lt. Uhura, Mr. Sulu and Chekhov, go where no man or woman had gone before, back in 1966. I get as much of a kick out of this movie.The pilot of the first Star Trek series, a two-part episode entitled 'The Menagerie,' starred Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Christopher Pike. With his sapphire-blue eyes and charismatic personality, Hunter had been successful earlier playing Jesus Christ in 'King of Kings.' Bruce Greenwood fleshes out what Commander Pike was truly like before his injury depicted 47 years ago in Roddenberry's first stab at creating the Federation.William Shatner was an up-and-coming young actor who had achieved considerable fame in Stratford Ontario, acting in quite an array of the Bard's histories, comedies, tragedies and romances. Shatner had been impressive in such films as 'Judgment at Nuremburg,' 'The Brothers Karamazov' and 'The World of Suzi Wong.' Christopher Pike in the current reboot has to be Kirk, believably, without being Shatner.Even to attempt to recapture the imagery, the cadence and the poignancy of those early shows would be very daunting. For director Abrams to meld numerous fan-favorite characters, themes and scenes, producing one of the best Star Trek films I have seen, is truly admirable.Karl Urban's tone, pace, his Southern accent, even his body language and timing, channel DeForrest Kelly's Dr. McCoy, right down to the doctor's paranoia about technology, especially the idea of his molecules being discorporated, then recorporated, when he is asked to 'beam down.' The Chief Engineer doing most of the beaming down, Commander Montgomery Scott, is re-imagined by Simon Pegg, who takes Scott where James Doohan, the original Scotty, had not gone before, making Scott just as important in several scenes as any of the principal characters. Both Scott and Uhura figure prominently into the resolution of the many tangled webs in the plot in ways that Doohan and Nichelle Nichols, the original Uhura, would be proud, and maybe even more than a little envious, of.Zachary Quinto's interpretation of the young Mr. Spock is breathtakingly like the Spock that Trekkies know and love, yet Quinto makes that character his own, as well, newly-minted. The brief impressive cameo by Leonard Nimoy, himself, is tantamount to a Vulcan mind-meld between the older and younger actor. Quinto's acting skills somehow both recapitulate and reinvent those of his predecessor.Chris Pine is not William Shatner. Somehow, however, Pine manages to act more headstrong, more impulsive, and even more of an outrageous maverick who seems to think that rules are like candy canes to be crunched and swallowed or spat out, before reinventing new procedures that defy the Prime Directive to solve thorny galactic conundrums.This movie cranks. With a running time of about two hours, there is no lull, no dead space, no time for your adrenalin to abate even a little. At several points, the suspense was almost unbearable, when I could not imagine how the entire crew might escape certain death.Abrams, who has also produced 'Lost' and 'Super 8,' is at the top of his form.The cinematography is extraordinary, accentuating, amplifying and delineating scenes and moments like a Greek chorus.Generally speaking, the Academy Award Committee turns a blind eye toward science fiction films, but it is just possible that they may make an exception in terms of the way this movie was filmed.The great scientist, Sir Arthur C. Clark, warned 53 years ago in 'Profiles in the Future,' that 'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.' That's how I felt watching this movie. These professional pretenders produced one believable illusion after another. Cognizant of brilliant benchmarks that went before, movies like 'Alien,' Abrams has created a movie that can stand up to the great ones.Most amazingly, Abrams has created a Star Trek movie that does not require its audience to remember Ricardo Montalban in 'Space Seed,' or Roddenberry's 'Star Trek III,' both of which this movie powerfully alludes to.The suspense and excitement actually accelerate as the movie flows along. That is rare. Abrams and crew are to be praised as artists who care about their craft and their legacy. In Hollywood, that is extremely rare. To attempt to enrapture Trekkies, Trekkers, and the uninitiated -takes guts.",9,4,8,21 May 2013
Dear John," Disappointing
","I was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in 'Dear John,' but it was very slow moving; and I felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers. I usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.The cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters, focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum became bogged down in what became a very 'hang-dog' series of expressions in response to loss.",4,24,47,5 February 2010
The Way Back," Power is Something You Take
","Any film directed by Peter Weir would draw my immediate attention. Co-Writer, director and producer of 'The Way Back,' Weir is responsible for other great films: 'Dead Poets Society,' 'The Year of Living Dangerously,' 'Gallipoli,' and 'The Truman Show.'A masterpiece, this film is a powerful testament to the power of human bonding, the drive to survive no matter what, and the power of love to overcome terror and hatred, which Hitler boasted would always overcome reason. This is a move about why Hitler's thesis did not work.It is interesting to turn from my viewing of The History Channel's new series, 'The Bible,' which like the Bible, like our world now, is extremely violent. The men who escape from a Siberian nightmare turn hatred inside out, creating their own ethos. Like a palimpsest, which can never fully be erased, allows these survivors to write over its surfade a new image, a new version, a new vision,the next chapter of their lives free from the tyranny that threatened to snuff out everything that mattered. As Martin Luther King, Jr., warned, 'Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.'Ed Harris, who has always impressed me, whether he is portraying a haunted gunslinger or Senator John McCain, is at the very top of his form in this film. The furrows of his brow tell a tale, even the way he is dressed, the sapphire diamonds in his gaze, symbolize physical, mental and moral toughness. His repeated refrain, that 'Kindness can get you killed,' continues to take on new and more gentle import as the story unfolds, almost like shifting waves of sand in the endless, scorching Gobi Desert.Mark Strong who, in my opinion, along with James Gandalfini, saved 'Dark Night Thirty,' from mediocrity, giving it the believability it lacked until they entered the story, is intense, laconic, commanding instant respect every time he speaks. That is a challenge to accomplish in this cast, in this story, where each man becomes a sort of resurrected piston in a rebuilt engine comprised of cast-offs, rejects, the detritus of the maniacal fury of Hitler and Stalin.The story begins when Hitler and Stalin, like ravenous wolves, each tear their half out of Poland, and many who do not immediately perish, are cruelly thrust into a Gulag in Siberia. A small cluster of canny would-be-survivors escapes. That's the easy part. One of them knows how to survive in the wilds, using pine cones and other surprising tricks that work. Together, they find enough food and water, survive disease and infection, traverse one of the world's most formidable deserts, and scale several Himilayan mountains to reach freedom. The government official in India who greets them asks for their passports. They smile. 'How did you get here?' 'We walked,' the men respond.Our world has endured financial collapse, avaricious, high tech, democracy-wrecking criminals who did not go to jail, zealots who place fanaticism before the brotherhood of man, woman and child. This is a movie to reflect upon. We are alive. Now what?Shakespeare's Edgar, a noble survivor in 'King Lear,' mutters, 'This is not the worst as long as we can say, 'This is the worst.'' We are alive. So what? The men and the woman in this story did not knuckle under to Hitler or Stalin. They did not die suffering unmitigated horrors in the Gulag. They blazed a new way, new lives.A Russian thug, a comic accountant, a pastry chef who is an accomplished artist, a priest, a pole with night blindness, and another condemned pole who knows how to live in the wilds and leads them all.Hitler killed 6,000,000 Jews. Stalin made 50,000,000 people 'disappear.' We must never forget. Demagogues beware: As John Steinbeck warned, 'Repression tends to knit the repressed.'",9,0,3,5 April 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," Most Enjoyable Movie of the Summer for Me So Far . . .
","The story, the writing and the acting were top-notch. The story balances romance, action, history, patriotism, and eye-popping scientific innovations all the more remarkable for their 1942 appearance.I thought that this was the first movie that truly resembled an early forties super-hero comic book as acted out by live performers.The film displayed suspense, sentiment,a strong,realistic sense of danger, and a strong sense of justice within the framework of a fantasy loosely-linked to the Nazi threat.Chris Adams' combination of sincerity, humility and determination combine with skillful supportive work by Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Hugo Weaving and others.I had read four critics' reviews prior to watching the movie, and I strongly feel that the film itself greatly exceeded my expectations.I'd like to see it at least one more time - with sub titles so that I can catch every word of dialog during the action sequences.",Null,12,25,22 July 2011
Man of Steel," Worth seeing
","I've been fascinated by Superman since I was a small child, so it's been 63 years since I first watched George Reeves portray the man of steel on television back in the 1950s. Reeves was very fatherly, a very wise, dependable superhero; even as Clark Kent, he seemed very dependable.Christopher Reeve is still my favorite Superman, but Henry Cavill looks like a Greek god on screen. He has a faraway look in his eye as if he truly was not-of-this-earth, but he seems essentially gentle, kind and, above all, helpful. When this Superman has to face people who possess all of his powers, he acts, quite realistically, I thought, shocked and stunned. Many scenes strongly sense that this Superman could be defeated by creatures who possess his super powers.Having seen 'Watchman' and '300,' I knew that Zach Snyder's interpretation of the Superman story was going to be very realistic, edgy, dark. The violence in this movie is like watching real violence, man-made or natural; since it is created by creatures who are more-than-man, it seems like a little of both.Amy Adams just can't seem to go wrong. Even in a very uneven story like 'Trouble with the Curve,' she adds perky, happy, spirited feminine animation; here, too, she is more alive than any other character. Her Lois Lane comes across as a vivacious rainbow alongside the very laid-back, mellow, gentlemanly Superman that Cavill presents.In many scenes, I caught myself wondering whether Cavill had truly studied Christopher Reeve. Under his clothing, Cavill displays much more of a massive body builder physique, layer upon layer of hard, thick, tough muscle. He looks more like Hercules with his shirt off.I was very impressed with Russell Crowe as Jor-el, Superman's Kryptonian father; and the technical creation of Kryptonian civilization, spacecraft and so forth is fresh, at times scary. The destruction is frightening at times -connoting in my mind images of Sandyhook, and other sudden, brutal events the world has suffered or witnessed this past year.Laurence Fishburne's Perry White did not seem special to me. He spoke his lines; he is an African American. I sensed no special or unique angle on his dramatization of the character. I still cherish my salient childhood image of the actor with the white hair and the decisive manner who performed along with George Reeves back in the 50s.Despite the cutting back and forth across time, showing Superman as a small child, then as an adult, I was not the least bit confused.I thought that Kevin Costner and Diane Lane held up creditably as Jonathan and Martha Kent.Michael Shannon reveals far more of General Zod's personality, motivation, and mind set. He is on screen and speaking to us in a very direct manner in far more scenes, and we have a chance to see him as more of a multi-faceted character. In previous cinematic interpretations, actors portraying Zod came across very one-dimensionally, very flat: mean, cruel, heartless and ruthless. Shannon suggests that he had hoped that Superman would help him in his mission here on earth.The movie cleverly leaves itself open for a possible sequel, and I sincerely hope that this crew gets that chance. I will be eager to see how they produce a sequel, knowing what worked and what could work better the second time.Several characters need to be more finely and deeply tuned. Cavill's Superman needs to be more assertive next time. Amy Adams has set the bar perfectly for Lois Lane: sure of herself, well-grounded, very capable, dignified, proud and assertive.'Man of Steel' is a great action thriller, an excellent epic, a could-be-great-saga with great writing. In one scene where Clark Kent is a child and saves lives, he and his adoptive father, Jonathan Kent, have a heart-to-heart discussion about Jonathan's strong suggestion that he keep his super powers strictly secret. The boy asks plaintively whether he should have simply allowed people to die, and his dad replies, 'Maybe.' I thought that line fell totally flat.Not only was there no Jimmy Olson, Mike Kelly obviously portrayed some important Daily Planet employee who was never identified, and he never really did much other than look important.There is much to build on in a sequel or prequel or both. Strengths to augment and weaknesses to renovate. I'm hopeful that Zach Snyder will receive the opportunity to create a follow up opus, and that he will use and listen to test audiences galore.I'd like to see the characters of Superman, Lois, Perry White and others deepened, sharpened, and more clearly defined.I want more humor and more heart in the next one. The many obligatory scenes, characters, conflicts and themes from previous ventures were addressed in this film. The sequel to 'Man of Steel' needs to seek to accomplish what J.J. Abrams has done recently for 'Star Trek,' i.e. use the talented newcomers to create a great movie that can stand alone as a work of art.",7,7,12,19 June 2013
Warrior," Fathers and Sons
","Cameras cut away too soon from pivotal wrestling holds that spell victory for Brendan. The Moby Dick motif could have worked with adequate foreshadowing or exposition. Another movie in which a protagonist suffers unbelievable punishment in the ring for far too long to credibly achieve victory at the last moment. Despite those misgivings, this movie is well-written, well-acted and superbly directed. It reminded me of the exploration of abusive father-son relationships in such other films as 'The Great Santini' with Robert Duval and 'I Never Sang for My Father' with Gene Hackman. The film contains many great scenes that will be crowd pleasers for an array of audiences, especially the scenes depicting the students of physics teacher/warrior Brendan and the scenes showing Brendan getting into tip-top shape. The development of the human adversaries/behemoths is cleverly arranged with predicable but stunning results. The angle of vision resulting from realizing that one fighter is a formidable hero/AWOL soldier fleeing from some demonic Iraqi cage, adds another believable layer to Tommy and to the movie, too. I liked the scene in which Brendan allows the very serious little girls to paint his face like a fairy princess on the deck in the family's back yard. I thought the fight with the Russian was almost totally unbelievable. No one could endure that much damage; and though it is quite plausible that such a juggernaut fighter might never have faced that much pain, since he usually ended the fight in one punch, it would have been nice to see more of a detailed close-up of that particular winning hold.",Null,1,5,12 September 2011
Judgment at Nuremberg," The Greatest Generation - on Film
","I have watched this movie countless times since it came out in 1961 when I was 16. My father and I often watched and commented on movies that delved deeply into character and ethical issues. It was his way of sharing and discussing his most fervent beliefs and values - and I did the same for 40 years of teaching: using film to augment literature and life issues.I was struck today by the fact, not terribly original of me to say so, that human beings who have surmounted periods of incredible destruction, sorrow, hatred, intolerance and devastation - like The Great Depression and World War II - seem now to me to be larger than life. I'm now in a Prayer Group that includes four ladies who range from 76-95. Conversations with them are flesh-and-blood history lessons.We have good actors and actresses today. But we do not have a Spencer Tracy, a Cary Grant, a Marlene Dietrich. Perhaps movies are the artistic repository not merely of art on film - but of a particular epoch, a particular ethos of a society or even of a civilization.I think it is that set of viewpoints that 'Judgement at Nuremberg' managed to capture. It is a movie that each succeeding generation should view, consider, discuss and incorporate in their thinking.The film made me grateful that, in the 1930's in America, we did not have a figure like Adolf Hitler emerge to cause the 'fever' and the 'disease' that Jannings refers to in his long somber speech. But when I hear some of our leaders and would-be leaders telling Americans what they think we want to hear - instead of what we really need to hear -not quite so pleasant to be told to (a) live within your means (b) save and (c) invest - Add a potent mixture of intolerance,hatred, and especially rampant, pervasive fear - and where would America be? When power and winning surmount truth, the national cauldron, the crucible of politics, economics, education, all that we devote our lives to could curdle, fester and poison; and that process would be most terrifying and most dramatic in the minds of our youth, the Jungen Hitler turned into vicious tattle-tales spying on, ratting on and sending even their own parents to the gibbet or the concentration camp.The movie gave me a chill. It can always happen again. Anywhere. Anytime.",10,0,1,1 May 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Life is seldom either/or. I much prefer both/and
","Years ago, I blundered into Stieg Larsson's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' I think I was guided there by one of the wonderful book gurus at our local Kazoo Book store.I was stunned and fascinated by Larsson's ability to weave a thriller, a mystery, a complicated series of romantic relationships, each separate yet all connected to a maverick discredited journalist who is given a second chance to bring down a shyster, avaricious financial predator.I read all three books in the trilogy, then listened to each them on CD audio book as I drove long distance and around town. Accomplished actors read Larsson's words with clever use of dialect, accent, interpretation and use of silence, pauses and emotion. I began to wonder just how influential the translator was in the production of Larsson's books; he passed away before the books' phenomenal success.Looking at Larsson's literary prowess prior to the publication of this series, I felt as though I were looking at the life of Peter Jackson, who produced The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Both auteurs had enjoyed a strong modicum of success before their respective hits, but it would be like comparing The Beatles or the Eagles teenage fledgling attempts at composing and singing and instrumentation, with their grandiose later successes.Enter Daniel Craig, and Rooney Mara, and Robin Wright, with a great writer and director propelling this reboot. Craig tries mightily to be a puppy dog kind of guy, the sort of men women are irresistibly drawn to. Women may be drawn to Craig, but not for those reasons. He is still very much in his James Bond mode with his body builder physique and 8% body fat,in this American rendition of the Swedish novel/movie. The Swedish movie grabbed me immediately because characters like Eric Berger played totally convincingly by Lena Endre, instantly become the character. No doubts. No qualms. The Swedish movie evinces the aura of believability, verisimilitude by feeling like a documentary of the original novel; however, the Swedish movie, unlike the American version, can be readily comprehended by an American audience, by any audience that has not read the book.I like Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Harriet's grandfather; he's at the top of his form. But the actor portraying that same role in the Swedish version is dead spot on. It's in the eyes; the forty year pain of running a high-powered corporation coupled with 40 years of personal loss show up in the crumbling, but brave, demeanor of the Swedish actor. Plummer is a skilled thespian playing another role.Robin Wright is a gorgeous woman, but she walks through this role, probably trying for a minimalist effect. I believe instantly that the dark intense fire in the eyes of Lena Ender every time she looks Michael Nyqvist in the eyes is real, smoldering, to die for.Rooney Mara does an excellent job of portraying Lisbeth Salander, but Noomi Rapace's interpretation is not-of-this-earth. She put so much authentic preparation in that role that her subsequent acting roles have severely paled in contrast. She even seems out of place in the second Robert Downey, Jr. Sherlock Holmes sequel because she's still in her Salander role to some extent. I'm not sure she'll ever break out of it - unless she's prepared to inject the same gestalt effort into each every character the way she did with Lisbeth. Some child actors never do adapt to the metamorphosis to adult actor. Some can. Mickey Rooney managed it, but a pale shadow of 'Boys' Town' with Spencer Tracy.Nyqvist's portrayal of Bloomqvist is also spot on. More than a bit out of shape, he has the eyes, the demeanor, the tender vulnerability that women like Erica and Lisbeth and even the ultra-secret Swedish operative Monica, would-be Olympic gymnast, who works out two hours a day, finds absolutely entrancing, that effortless come-hither quality that Nyqvist projects. Craig's appeal is much more alpha-atop-the-macho-food-chain. Craig was excellent in 'Layer Cake,' and for audiences who have not read the books and seen the Swedish movies, he will help make millions for this version; however, the American translation is so convoluted at several points, it occurred to me that had the plot, characters and the very ambiance of Larsson's trilogy not been coursing around inside of me, I'd have been lost, or, at best, very confused.The American picture is doing well. I wonder how it will play in Sweden? I hope that screenwriter, Steven Zaillian, director, David Finscher, and the cast learn something fundamental, i.e. If it ain't broke, don/t fix it. The Swedish adaptation of the second book in the trilogy,'The Girl Who Played with Fire,' was merely acceptable compared to the first film. The third Swedish film, based on the last book in Larsson's trilogy was so very chopped to pieces and badly edited, I was crushed. That book is the very best mystery, thriller, murder-romance-suspense novel I have ever read. I was an English teacher for 43 years and have been attracted to stories like this since I was 12.You can't make a silk purse out of sow's ear. No, it isn't that bad. My father who did not read much but was an avid movie fan and I often argued about movie-to-book adaptations. It was impossible to convince him that the movie lacked something, that a two hour rendition of a novel that was hundreds of pages of events and powerful nuances, could possibly be better. Movies are like outlines, or lie-detector tapes, of the books they purport to represent. Books fill in lavishly, profusely, what movies may merely indicate or suggest.I could be totally mistaken. I am, after all, a human being, and I have my biases. But, if you're curious, just for fun, watch the Swedish version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' and see what you think. I'm glad that both versions exist.",8,0,3,17 March 2013
Django Unchained," A Serious, Well-Made Film . . .
","I had read four reviews of 'Django Unchained,' and all of them contained very unflattering or harsh assessments of the film. After watching it today, I wonder if all of us watched the same movie.The first reaction I had was and continues to be this: Tarantino has made a serious movie. The attention to detail is stunning. I wouldn't be surprised if the costumer earned an Oscar.Leonardio DiCaprio is at his very best. And he's playing an elegant creep - or rather, he is someone flourishing in a creepy culture much of which is economically and emotionally accepted - the way the global drug culture is accepted by many today.Christoph Waltz has the toughest role: trying to outdo the part he played in 'Inglorious Basterds.' In 'Django Unchained,' however, he serves his dramatic function ably.Jamie Foxx is nearly perfect in his role as Django in a movie that runs on a bit too long, but Tarantino is so good as this sort of speculative revisionist history cum film, that it must be tough to turn the camera off. Foxx's performance is emblematic of much of the cast and the spirit of the film - authentic.I was shocked to see how many capable actors like Bruce Dern have important brief cameos in the movie. Tarantino has assembled quite an effective aesthetic coalition, and, for the most part, this movie works. It makes the culture of slavery come alive in all of its horror, a culture based upon racial hubris. Samuel L. Jackson is also at the very top of his form, exceeding my expectations as a sort of African American slave, Calvin Candie 'Yes man,' and majordomo of Candie's mansion. DiCaprio's visceral demonstration of phrenology at the dinner table is entirely chilling.At the very least, this film will provoke intense discussion, argument, debate about slavery, segregation, the history of the American South and other cognate topics.I read Tarantino's recent interview in 'Playboy' Magazine, and I know he is quite concerned about his reputation, his legacy, and, chiefly, about not only keeping the quality of his films up, but, moreover, knowing when to quit. He cites the examples of many other seminal directors who continued to make movies and faded in promise, impact, or aesthetic greatness. Tarantino is only 49 years old. I hope he is not ready to quit, but if he did, this movie would not be a bad way to go out.There is violence in the movie, but I don't feel that it is glamorized. The actual history of violence in 1858 as compared to the violence in this movie is tantamount to comparing a snowstorm to a snowflake. The idea of an African American avenger/savior/fast gun is believably handled, especially when the most powerful themes seem to be liberty, freedom, and love. As a revivionistic view of history, 'Djano Unchained' is more believable than 'Dances with Wolves.'I know that some, like Spike Lee, detest this movie. Just as many readers have seen Mark Twain's 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' as a satire of racism, there are others who see it as promulgating racism if only because of the prevalence of the use of the N word. That will probably be the case in 'Django Unchained' also. Had I grown up the victim of vicious racism, I might very well feel exactly that way.I think 'Django Unchained' is a well-made movie that takes its themes seriously. The fact that it has commanded so many fine actors and actresses to participate, and the fact that these artists are performing at the top of their form, represents a powerful testimony to the scope, the range and the achievement this movie signifies.Many scenes in 'Inglorious Basterds' seemed to be throw-away interludes, rather juvenile creations inserted in the form of a gag, a joke. This is not the case with 'Django Unchained.' I think this movie will serve as the launching pad for discussions about a period of American history that few if any are proud of, but as I think we saw clearly in the recent November elections, the battle for the freedom of women and minorities is far from over. Such battles apparently need to be continually fought and re-fought.",8,1,5,4 January 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Intriguing Reboot
","Jeremy Renner plays a character much needier, in background, than Matt Damon's Jason Bourne. Rachel Weiz is an A list actress who has elevated every film I've seen her in. The very believable build-up in the story to the point where she trusts Aaron - really sold the movie as far as I'm concerned. I emphasized with the doctor's terror, and I was soothed and calmed by Aaron Cross's reassuring manner as he converted her from total panic to partnership.Stacy Keach, Scott Glenn and David Straitharn continue to depict a poison-fanged duo of back-stabbing, high-ranking CIA mavens whose words continually turn into miasma.Cutting edge medicine meets 21st century Machiavellianism. This is a movie Aldous Huxley would appreciate. I take a gram and only am. Ending is better than mending.Renner somehow manages to be the six million dollar man, Everyman, and the quintessential underdog simultaneously.The movie is underscored by a baleful pulsing series of musical bass tones that accentuate the weird perils the doctor and the assassin are pursued by - and others that they thrust themselves into deliberately.I thought that the LARX scenes were the best in a movie full of excellent set pieces. As expected, Aaron Cross is eventually pursued by a hit man his equal or greater. That was the pattern in the first three Bourne movies. Rachel Weitz's doctor serves as far more of an equal partner in meeting challenges than the feminine leads did in the previous trio of films.The pacing the movie can and should be improved. Some of the dialog was delivered at such breakneck speed, I wished I had had access to subtitles.I thought that the scene with Landy should be expanded - but perhaps that is the job of a sequel.I do plan to watch the movie again - at least once more, preferably, when the DVD becomes available, with subtitles, so I can understand all of the dialog.",8,6,11,22 August 2012
The Hurt Locker," 'Hurt Locker' Compelled Our Participation.
","My partner and I have been viewing movies generated by Hollywood for the past few years following America's invasion of Iraq in 2003, and most of them have fallen short of creating the immediacy, the verisimilitude and the total belief that art is imitating reality. Not so with Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker,' which steadily builds in believability, suspense and urgency.The fact that three very well known actors appear in what are essentially cameo roles is surprising. The fact that all three immediately command the screen in just a few minutes is stunning.'The Hurt Locker' is a buddy movie with a maverick buddy, a soldier whose adrenalin throbs only when he is thrusting himself into dangers the average person would cringe from even thinking about---and yet he is helpless when it comes to functioning in domesticity. The central protagonist is the point man not for isolationism, but rather, for minding our own business and recognizing that direct military intervention wreaks havoc.",Null,0,3,2 February 2010
Meet Joe Black," Mirror and Razor
","'Meet Joe Black' is very much like many of my favorite books. I can read them often and they lose no flavor; in fact, their characters and the stories woven about them seep deeper and deeper into my own life to the extent that fiction and non-fiction intermingle.Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, again becomes the character, Magnate Bill Parrish. Hopkins again makes it seem as if every word emanating from his lips is newly-minted as if the struggles he is undergoing well up out of threat, terror, and Ozymandias-like success.Claire Forlani truly seems to be the real daughter of this business titan; I believe it is her most convincing role to date.Despite the fact that much of the movie's plot takes place in the rarefied atmosphere of the biggest business on the planet, in pressurized board rooms where the fate of lives and corporations are decided like a knife fight in an alley, I continue to find more and more to relate to in this movie over the years.Thomas Newman's intriguing, ethereal musical motifs are like shadows of the characters and their tentative actions in a movie about people who illustrate, in a fresh manner, the clichÃ© that money does not necessarily buy happiness; in fact, opulence makes life trickier.This is especially a movie about fathers and daughters, about two very different kinds of beings who ingratiate themselves into the good graces of a father, with mixed results, because, ultimately, this movie is about various kinds of love and various kinds of life lessons.Brad Pitt demonstrates that his earlier work in 'Interview with a Vampire' was no fluke; Pitt earns my respect in a dual role, alternating from sympathetic and lovable to the obverse and then back again.I think that 'Meet Joe Black' is a film that acts as a mirror for my own life, forcing me to do quite a bit of personal self-reflection. The film also behaves very much like a razor: the dialog is sharp, cutting, peeling away layers of every character as powerful emotions buffet their lives, paring away all sorts of fronts, romantic, mercenary and societal.Like some novels that I regard as old friends, stories I can savor and truly delve deeper into as I read them every year, I am a different person each time I watch 'Meet Joe Black.' The dialog, plot and all other elements never deviate, but I change as life buffets me, paring away my many fronts as I grow, learn and take risks.This is an entertaining movie, but it is a very pensive film. The humor is very lightly ironical, but quite cerebral in the sense of discovering anew just what each of us truly wants in our lives, in our relationships, in our business deals and careers. The movie strongly investigates personal and professional legacies, ethics and morality.Despite the high society backdrop, I found the story very much down-to-earth. The Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven Heavenly Virtues do not budge simply because the personages who grapple with and adopt these values are rich, spoiled, guileless, unaffected, or effete. This is a good people movie, especially in terms of very deep questions such as 'Who am I?' 'Who do I truly wish to be?' 'What do I really want from love and life?' 'Meet Joe Black' is a movie that touched me at first viewing; and each time I watch it, it gets to me, down deep.Each of us has his or her own definition of entertainment. This will not be everyone's cup of tea. Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani fans may enjoy the manner in which the script opens each actor. I can imagine each of them reading the script for the first time. I can imagine Hopkins reading it and deciding that the script would provoke from him a different set of subtle emotions, gestures and interactions in a different set of unique relationships.Like a razor, the movie shaves life very close. Tomorrow and next year, I will need another shave, but the feel of the blade strikes me as quite different at 67 than it did 15 years ago when the movie came out. The film is also like a mirror, in that I find much in my own existence to think about and weigh in terms of happiness, success, expedience versus making truly authentic choices in life.",9,2,3,21 January 2013
Friends with Benefits," Better than any review had indicated . . .
","I strongly suspect that I am in the distinct minority in terms of going to see movies to see what's good about them, not to look for flaws, errors, inconsistencies and weaknesses and then build my overall opinion upon those deficiencies.'Friends with Benefits' was a surprisingly good movie all the way through. I learned just how accomplished Justin Timberlake is. Singer, dancer and actor. Mila Kunis is his match emotionally in this film.It must be very difficult to create a romantic comedy based upon human frailty, based upon the characters' deepest yearnings and deepest fears. I think the movie did a good job of doing that. Even Woody Harrelson's character who started out as a caricature in the beginning of the movie, evanesced into a caring, compassionate, supportive human being - behind the facade of his seemingly crass humor.As always, Richard Jenkins was an actor that all of the characters could hang their performances upon.This is a movie with very touching, rather endearing humor,inclusive, not exclusive humor.I was pleasantly surprised, especially after reading many reviews which almost steered me away from watching it at all.",Null,4,9,28 July 2011
Avatar," The more I learn about this movie, the more I admire it.
","I first viewed 'Avatar' from about mid-way back in the theatre, and I was simply overwhelmed with the anti-manifest destiny theme, the magnificent, ominous creatures, and Zoe Saldana's inspired performance and the CGI.Stephen Lang portrays a tough, confident, field grade officer who walks the talk. At 57, he is in great physical condition, and he displays the grit and fanaticism of an old gunfighter slingshotted into the wild, dystopian future of human greed colliding with environmental harmony, far, far from planet earth.I believed that Pandora could really exist and that smarmy, cynical bureaucrats may change their settings but never abandon their crude, ends-justify-the-means quests for more riches, more power, damn the consequences.I hope that 'Avator' proves to be even partially as influential as 'Star Wars' was back in 1977.",Null,1,2,2 February 2010
Jack Reacher," Surprisingly Excellent
","John Wayne always played characters from the persona of himself. Whether he was 'Big Jake' or an African big game guide, Wayne was himself. Tom Cruise has been bruised for 30+ years for doing just that. One magnificent scene in 'Cocktail,' another short scene in 'Valhalla,' and his role in 'Tropic Storm' demonstrate that the man can act. Not to mention his acting in 'Magnolia.' I think Cruise embodies the spirit of Jack Reacher in this movie. Translating print to celluloid is going to disappoint purists. I based my career as a language arts teacher, in large measure, upon using film clips to bounce my students' perceptions and critical opinions off the text. That strategy overcame immaturity, ADD, ADHD, chronic fatigue and other forms of resistance to pedagogy at the time. So, yes, I expect that a producer, director, screen writer and actors and actresses to interpret the literary work; in fact, I like to see different renditions of the same essential story. Isn't that what we continually have done with Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Chekhov and other master writers? There is certainly more to life and art than mere cloning.I thought that Cruise brought a pensive intelligence to the character of Reacher. Richard Jenkins, Robert Duval and Rosamund Pike know how to let a moment simmer, not overplay it.The fight scenes were realistic. Even though I expected them, saw them coming, they were creative, believable, explosive, emotionally- intriguing.This is a movie I'd like to watch again after I've had time to assimilate it, process it, reflect upon it, but next time with the subtitles on, so I'll garner more that I missed when I was mostly privy to the ocular proof and not catching the auricular reassurance of nuances I missed or minimized.I'd like to see Cruise do more of this series. I could not help wondering how much different the movie might have been with a Dolph Lundgren commandeering the title role. I'd love to see that interpretation, too. Different is often intriguing.Tom Cruise is now 10 years younger than Paul Newman was when the two of them made 'The Color of Money.' There was a chemistry, a magic between the actor born in 1962 and the one born in 1925 then. They both loved racing cars. I couldn't help but notice some slippage in the driving sequences this time. Apparently, Reacher was a little rusty not only at the shooting but, moreover, at the driving.I look forward to the manner in which Tom Cruise and every other actor and actress continues to challenge and stretch their talents and abilities in the future.I got the strong sense from all of the artists on screen that they really meant every word, every gesture. They became the personages they were portraying on screen.There is also a strong part of me that enjoys seeing miscreants, jerks, perverts, punks, and sadists get what they have coming to them.This movie did a good job of achieving that goal.",8,4,11,2 January 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Not a True Believer
","Jessica Chastain is an excellent actress, but she is not a True Believer, which is what Maya must be, in reality. In 'Zero Dark Thirty,' Chastain gives the role her best shot. During the course of the movie, she does manage to work herself up to an obsessive-compulsive fury for the cause of pursuing and killing Osama bin Laden, but it is almost like watching Tiger Woods miss a putt.The willingness to die for her cause, blind faith and total allegiance, held together by the glue of hatred - these qualities propel the woman of words, the woman of action and the fanatic together. That combination is probably not very entertaining. It is probably very ugly, very off-putting to the judges at Cannes, the Golden Globe, the Academy Awards. To portray the real Maya, Chastain would have had to capture and project the sort of maniacal fury that her acting counterpart in 'Coriolanus,' Ralphe Finnes, projected. That wasn't pretty because it was raw ruthlessness, pure savagery, what the CIA calls termination with extreme prejudice.I thought the first two hours of this film did a good job of depicting in almost mind-numbing detail, the realities of the bureaucratic labyrinth: the carping and the back-biting, the colliding egos and the rampant ambition, the governmental anti-terror organization operatives continually bumping into each other in an effort to reconcile political correctness with justice or retribution. I almost walked out of the theater several times, but I made myself stay put and watch, because I had to know how the entire movie unfolded.Mark Savage and James Gandalfini projected far more knowing weariness, stamina, cynicism, real-world wariness and Machiavellian caginess than the other actors; and the movie began to interest me about the last 45 minutes of the film. That is where it began for me.The rest of this movie was not taut, not gripping, not shocking, not convincing. There was way too much slack in the movie. I would have edited it so that it held the audience's interest like a Wallenda high over Niagara Falls on a slender wire.Maybe it's just me, but I didn't learn anything new either about the pursuit, capture and assassination of bin Laden. Feelings are not facts, but the latter are important especially on the stage and screen. Actors are professional pretenders, and Gandolfini and Strong do more acting, grabbing my attention more than the other performers, with their eyes, their facial expressions, with gestures, commanding the very space about them, and the silence and the stillness. Such gifted performers do not even require language in order to act. I saw some of that power in Chastain when she began using her erasable marker on the window of her boss's office, but I never saw the person who would give up 12 years of her life to pursue, doggedly, irrationally, like some sort of female Inspector Javert, that illusive target.Maybe it's just me, but I expected more tension, more suspense, more intense character development. I was disappointed.",6,1,6,14 January 2013
Win Win," Partly Very True to Life, Partly Truncated, Partly Cluttered
","'Win Win' is a movie very much like 'Easy A' - in that it can't make up its mind what kind of movie it is going to be. A serious movie about the wonders and frustrations of being a father, mother, son, lawyer, wrestler or coach. and/or a movie that makes light of the many obstacles and difficulties of ordinary life. I thought that Alex Shaffer was outstanding as the teenager wrestler with immense talent and a troubled background. Paul Giamatti and Amy Ryan were terrific as a couple trying to deal with each new challenge in their marriage, and in their family. Each of these two actors becomes the character and then builds upon their respective roles with powerful acting skills.This film acted like one that was badly edited and/or one that richly deserved to go back into post-production so that it could be allowed a more well-developed ending.I thought that the role of Bobby was more of a distraction than a help.And yet there were moments of greatness in this film, very heart-warming scenes in which good story, good writing and good acting all dove-tailed.I would truly like to watch the director's cut of this one.Alex Shaffer will be heard from again. He displays a fierce, intense, compassionate stage presence - many times without uttering a word. His contribution alone would make the film worth watching or watching again as I will do.",6,2,3,22 April 2011
