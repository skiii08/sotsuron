Antz," Yes Yes Yes Yes!
","After seeing the Prince of Egypt, I asked myself where the drawing qualties SKG were. But now I know they need not bother anymore about drawing little characters by pen. Throw away your pens or give them to Disney so that they don't forget how to handle them. SKG can do everything by computer. Then, they are by far the best.They story seems to be written by Allen himself, being in a commercial mood. All characters fit better to the voices then their own bodies.I shall be short. This is a funny, action-packed escape movie. Last but not least, the small effects as drowning in a drop are very nice and very true!",9,0,0,4 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hey, it's Star Wars, who cares about quality?
","Under the impression that my view is somewhat superfluous, here is my short impression of SW1.* Story: Since nobody has ever cared about strong stories in American movies, it's no surprise that the story in the movie is very very very very, very bad. It's better to expect a sequence of huge action scenes and then be surprised that there's any correlation between the scenes.* Acting/Actors: Oops. Sorry. Not everybody is computer-simulated! So some real acting is needed. Shame that the nonhuman characters had the best performance. Can R2D2 and C3PO please get an Oscar? For the real actors: Is can't feel good losing from bunch of computers. Even young Skywalker was bad directed. The poor kid hardly cried when leaving his beloved mother.* Special effects: Ooh. Good! Heavy! Wow! Very impressive. I just love shapeships going WOOOOOOOUUUUUUAAAAAAAHHHH when the pass. And the sound of the light-sabers!! Yeah! But, as I already mentioned, it sometimes feels as if you're in Toy Story. Tough it's extraordinary good, it's a bit too much. Some more depth in the characters and story would have been in place.* Music: Best ever. There's no movie with a better score. I especially liked the sound of Darth Maul.* Total: As a single film it's not really a great movie but hey, it's Star Wars so please please be quiet and go see it! Quick!",8,0,0,28 May 1999
American Beauty," Top movie
","This is a movie for those who have never ever felt that lovely feeling of malicious delight. If you haven't had the feeling after this movie, you will never feel it.Best movie in a long time.Script: topMusic: topType-casting: topActing: Don't knowBest quote:'I didn't GET fired, I just told my boss to get lost and go f**k himself.

There's Something About Mary," not a please-go-see-this-one-before-you-die
","This movie is not a please-go-see-this-one-before-you-die.It is a NakedGuntype movie with a few subtle changes. First: the number of jokes is reduced by a factor of 100. Second: the jokes themselves are exploited so long that everything becomes terribly predictable.Is there nothing positive to say about it? Yes there is. Even when the larger part of the jokes is slow and predictable, it is impossible that all of them are bad. So you can expect a few laughs (watch for the banana sorbet and the 6th member of the Jackson five). And, the movie features the great track of Shirley Bassey and the Propellorheads: History repeating. Last but not least, the playback clip on the end of the movie was fun.",4,0,0,25 November 1998
Tarzan," A new classic (?), but not for the kids
","+ and - points:
+ music well integrated in movie; finally a Disney movie where the songs do not suddenly appear for the need of a song but because some music is required.<ul><li>Phil Collins still makes the same music as 20 years ago; we know the trick by now Phil, try something new (and NEVER EVER sing another song in a foreign language!)</li></ul>+ a lot of action, not just action sequences that are required to get young parents with their children in the theater.<ul><li>it's so much action that the Disney cuteness disappears a little. The average age of the visitor Disney aims at is increasing (children below 4 don't buy toys and the ones below 13 don't have much to spend)</li></ul>+ a solid story (for an American movie, that is); only the musical scene in the camp jumped out, but that one's for the toys again)
Total: This might become one of the new classics. Though it's better than missers as Pocahontas and Mulan it's not a good as the Lion King and certainly has not the class of Bambi of the Jungle Book",8,0,1,15 August 1999
