Blade Runner 2049," Keep the cult alive
","I find it quite amusing the original Blade Runner of 1982 didn't break even at the box office on a budget of $28 million. Even after its re release in 1993 and subsequent showings up to 2012 it only made $32 million. Now all of a sudden we seem to have all of these arm chair film critics that really never gave a damn about Blade Runner to begin with are telling those of us whom became cult members and kept it alive like the Trekkies of Star Trek, how terrible Blade Runner 2049 is.",9,1,9,22 October 2017
