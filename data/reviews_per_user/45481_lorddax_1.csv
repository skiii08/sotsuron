Lucky Number Slevin," A great revival of the suspense thriller
","This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire length. As you watch the movie you think you know whats going on but you've got that little feeling in the back of your head thats telling you there's something else thats slipping under your radar.The ending and opening of this movie are so expertly written that it feels like there's honestly no other way the movie could have closed. Me and my gal left this movie feeling as wired as drinking a pot of coffee, each.Bruce Willis has a commanding presence in the film and Freeman has the mysterious dangerous air about him, but its Josh who really shines. He portrays the character so well and keeps you riveted to the screen to see what happens next, and more importantly, why.If you are looking for a flick that will keep you guessing the entire way and make you love it as you sit on only the front part of the chair eyes glued to the screen, Lucky Number Slevin is it.",10,0,6,12 April 2006
