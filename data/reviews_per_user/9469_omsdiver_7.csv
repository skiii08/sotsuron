The Avengers," Is it all Holly(Łódź) can deliver?
","Honestly I don't understand how such crappy movie could get so high notes. The only thing that is coming to my mind is that a bunch of people hired by producers has written dozen of opinions and made thousands of votes via different accounts.There is nothing in this movie that can be described as funny, entertaining or eye-catching. Story line is so miserable, one can easily say there is no story line whatsoever. It is just a series of predictable, naive events without any kind of surprise or suspense.Acting is typical for American movies - childishly bombastic. Pathetic dialogs and mimicry is so disgusting I wanted to leave cinema in the mid of the show...no show is not a good description of what I have seen.I hoped at least for special effects but my disappointment reached the ground. Cartoon-type actions of Hulk (in fact there were no point of gathering all the heroes as Hulk himself could easily defeat entire invading armada) was the last coffin nail.To summarize Avengers was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It does not happen often but I wanted that movie to end before it takes a spin (what spin?!).",3,7,17,24 August 2012
Troy," Great budget, great production...even greater failure
","Some can say this is action movie so the historical background can be treated with certain degree of freedom - and it's true. But for Troy almost every aspect of history (or myth) was neglected. It's screenplay stands in opposition even to logic. But let's start from the beginning.I can understand that the director could not afford to show 10 years siege but there are ways to shorten the historical time. 16 days (or maybe 17, i did not count) instead of 10 years is for me going to far.I also cannot understand how the Greeks wanted to breach the walls of Troy without any single catapult or ballast - swords, javelins and arrows are a little bit ineffective against walls. Well, maybe they were counting that the siege will take long enough to discover powder or even guns.There are also some quite, I would say, even stupid moments. The first one takes place when Hector is leading counterattack after first battle day. Greeks are surprised, Achilles is drinking and probably doing some nasty things but suddenly he appeared and led the attack. After a short fight Hector is killing mighty Achilles, when appeared not to be Achilles himself. I wonder how it is possible that 50 - 70 thousands men (both armies) stopped the battle within few seconds after fake Achilles died. But even more funny is to see that Hector, knowing that Greeks could be crushed, is saying to Odysseus 'Come on guy, let's stop this fight and go for a drink or two.'Finally when Achilles killed Hector, being alone at the gates of Troy, no single soldier tried to stop the man who is going to desecrate the body of great Hector, no single arrow was shut, nothing happened.To summarize the Troy was one of my biggest disappointment this year.",3,0,2,27 July 2004
Gran Torino," A masterpiece!
","I have not seen such o good...perfect movie for a long, long time. On a very rare occasions one can see a masterpiece worth to spend two hours just to see its end. A final shot, last 5 minutes, last scene. This is such a movie. Simple in its visuals, not overloaded with effects, lacking great words and fine speeches. So what is left? The climax of the end. For this I would sacrify another two hours and maybe entire night. It is like watching last few seconds of NBA final with Jordan.As someone said Eastwood presents a mature art of directing a movie and playing main character. I would say it is even more. He has reached Mt. Everest and still climbing higher.",10,2,10,10 August 2009
Avatar," Some interesting observation
","A lot of words has been written so far in relation to Avatar so it makes no sense to write the same again. I fully agree with people who claims that this particular movie lacks innovative plot, subtle script an so on. But who cares?! The sole purpose of this movie was to introduce REALLY stunning visual effects and the purpose has been achieved in 200%. Leaving the cinema I felt like 30 years before when I saw Star Wars for the first time. And I don't care if others claim Avatar is shallow in terms of intrigue.I made however quite interesting observation. I have scanned through opinions of people who rated Avatar 0 of 10. More then 30% of 'worst' opinions has been written by people who did it for the first time. Another 30-40% has been written by those who previously have written maybe 3 or 4 opinions. It was also quite interesting to see what kind of movies they referred to. I have found maybe 2 or 3 persons whose attitude was quite 'stable'. They had also write quite negative opinions for other SciFi movies - well I can understand that. They do not like this kind of art. I have found however one person who knocked me down. He has given Avatar a 0 score and at the same time rated Transformers at 7 or 8. With all due respect Transformers are in every aspect inferior to Avatar. Special effects - fine but Avatar is a class for itself. Screenplay - give me a break. Transfomers are so childish, infantile I couldn't bear some parts of it. And finally actors. Avatar is not outstanding if acting is concerned but at least there are no superheroes like MacGyver able to defeat a huge army of adversaries with a lighter or swiss knife.",10,18,32,2 January 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Almost perfect
",The Revenge of the Sith was one of most expected movie over last 2 years and I have to admit I am not disappointed. I don't think it makes sense to discuss the visual effects as this part of all episodes is outstanding. What makes me feel again like 30 years ago is the climate of the movie. Once again I could feel 'electrocity' when watching intrigue made by senator Palpatine and once again I could sense something intangible...THE FORCE. It is a pity that the spirit of THE FORCE was lost in Episode I when Quin-Gon discovered large amount of midichlo(something) in blood of young Anakin. Before then I was pretty sure that THE FORCE is something one has to feel and no blood or urine test are necessary to make sure that someone has it or not. The only one thing I did not liked in ROTS is the final duel between Kenobi and Skywalker on the volcano planet. It looks to me very artificial when they were flying over melted rocks without any harm and few minutes later Anakin almost burn to death being further from the lava then when they fighting. But that's why I said 'Almost perfect' in a title. Regardless of this small spoiler a grade of 10 is the only possible choice.,10,6,13,1 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force...perverted
","SPOILERS!SPOILERS!SPOILERS!SPOILERS!At the beginning a quick resume for those who does not want to read the whole list of complaints. Definitely THE WORST of all Star Wars saga movies. I would prefer to watch full length Star Wars Clone Wars or even Star Wars Rebels instead of this. By this single movie Disney destroyed all the epic atmosphere that stand behind Star Wars.Going down to detail let me start from the high calibre guns. Even in worst of previous Star Wars movies (The Phantom Menace) you can almost feel the force. It presents itself in dialogues, style of fight and all other small elements associated either with Jedi or Sith. In this movie THE FORCE, the most important element of all Star Wars movies, is treated like a boost to natural skills that you can activate but very often charges of that boost is depleted. First scene of SWTFA is very promising. Kylo Ren, new superhero of dark side, is stopping the blaster shoot. I can't remember anyone else to be able to do it. Even more. Distracted by interrogation of captive he is still able to maintain that blast within his power. However a few minutes later he is defeated in mind duel by Ray, a new bright side hero. The problem is Rey is still not very aware of his powers. I could understand Kylo is not able to penetrate Ray's memories but the outcome of that scene is more than obvious - he was defeated. Another completely not understandable situation is when Kylo is revealing his true face. Maybe Adam Driver (actor playing Kylo) is so hungry the fame but that single moment destroyed the mystery Lucas was able to maintain throughout 3 episodes. The worst however came later. Even Darth Vader was not (at least at the beginning) so powerful he could dictate its will to all commanders of the Empire forces. On the other hand even Emperor felt awe. In case of Kylo his boss is treating him like a one of stromtrooper when confronted by general Hux. The climax of this reducing the importance of the Force is presented when Ray and Finn are fighting Kylo. First of all that fight is very chaotic and there is no dark force in how Kylo is fighting. There is also no mysticism in that fight. Compare it to famous duel of fates (Obi and Qui-gon against Darth Maul). Sorry, bad idea it is utterly incomparable. Kylo is beaten by simple storm trooper. It does not matter finally he almost kills Finn. For me it is unimaginable that apprentice of the most powerful dark side lord in the universe is not able to handle a single stromtrooper.But there are also other less important elements of the movie that makes is...tragic. Lack of Force associated with Kylo or should I say very erratic use of it is not the only problem of Kylo Ren. His behaviour is also pathetic. I can understand dark force warriors are driven by passion more than Jedi and passion which means hate is what gives them strength. However the attacks of anger in case of Kylo are super pathetic. He behaves like a kid in kindergarten whose toy was taken away. How does it comply with force control.And finally the person chosen to play Kylo. No words can describe how hopeless the choice was. He could play some role in Harry Potter but not Star Wars.The above are the most important weaknesses of SWTFA but it is not all. There are more bigger or smaller glitches that makes SWTFA very, very weak movie.",1,29,34,28 March 2016
Happy Feet," Boring, boring, boooooooring ...
","I would probably never seen this movie but kids have its rights. I have read some opinions before and hoped it will not be a waste of time. Unfortunately it was. It is one of very few movies I would like to forget. The story itself is quite boring and monotonous. Dialogues without a twist. Visual...well, snow, snow, snow and once again snow. For almost 80% of the movie nobody knows what is going on and where it should go. The conclusion is super artificial and being honest ruins completely the movie. The only positive thing about Happy Feet is that my kid did like it, not very much but ... In comparison to Shrek, Ice Age it is a complete disaster.",2,1,3,22 January 2007
