The New World," a Pocahontas and john smith story of real people
","This movie is horrible. A waste of time. It basically plays the same song over and over occasionally changing the volume, and if your lucky, they might speak a few words. Think again about renting this movie. Even the cartoon Pocahontas is better. This is pretty much all you need to read. Just stop here. It is mandatory to have 10 lines of text though, so i will go on in more detail. If you've seen the cartoon you know what is going to happen. Pochahontas tries to protect John Smith from death in like the first 5 minutes of the movie. The whole story line is stupid and i would never watch this movie again. It was a waste of money and i really advise you to not make the same mistake i did.",1,2,8,18 January 2007
