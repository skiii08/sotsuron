The Hangover," What happens in Vegas...is hilarious
","The majority of the last decade of film comedy has given us 'American Pie' rip-offs and Judd Apatow rip-offs, so it's refreshing to see Todd Phillips return to a situational comedy with great relationships and great dialogue. 'The Hangover' is a hard R rating, but I was never overwhelmed with that all-we-have-for-you-is-gross-out-material feeling that other, more desperate films resort to. The confidence of the acting and direction in 'The Hangover' is easy to tag along with, and the ride is worth it. The story doesn't seem like anything new – four guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party and things go horribly, horribly wrong. The quartet wakes up the morning after to find they can't remember what happened and the state of their hotel room is chaotic.The biggest enjoyment of this film is watching reveal after reveal as the guys discover just what mayhem their night consisted of. And the rabbit hole gets deeper and deeper as the plot unfolds, and the movie gets funnier and funnier. This film is a great starring vehicle for perennial supporting actor Bradley Cooper, whose turns in 'Wedding Crashers' and 'Failure to Launch' first got him noticed in the movies. The other main members of the crew are Ed Helms (SO funny on 'The Office') and Zach Galifinakis, (funny in comic circles for years, finally getting his due in a big movie). It's a great casting turn to use these guys 'cause the scenes don't get dominated by the routine antics you'd expect from someone like Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, and even Seth Rogen, to a point. Every lead guy in this film is a wild card, and that's a huge asset to the movie.'Bromance' seems to be the theme to many of today's comedies, and despite a male-centric story, 'The Hangover' avoids lapsing into forced sentimentality and as a result finds more time for more laughs. Especially hilarious is the security cam footage from Mike Tyson's house and a visit to the wedding chapel where a particularly drunken event occurred the night before. The Mike Tyson cameo is hit and miss. It seems like the filmmakers wanted to exploit his eccentricity, having him sing along with a Phil Collins song, but he works best as a straight man to the madness of the party-goers.Maybe Tyson should've been more imposing, 'cause if I had one storyline issue, it was the lack of really threatening characters that would add a whole new level to the mystery of what happened the night before. Two police officers question the boys, but their relationship soon devolves into SNL-type characters and the guy's first run-in with Asian gangsters is hilarious in that what-have-they-gotten-themselves-into kind of way, but it's disappointing to learn that their boss (despite a hilarious entrance) is more cartoonish than intimidating. Watching our heroes squirm out from under a more ominous gangster might've been a more compelling choice.Those are minor issues with an otherwise funnier-than-hell movie that has dialogue I wish I spoke and characters I wish I knew.for one night.SPOILER TALK: I'm curious what women think of the result of all the debauchery in 'The Hangover'. In the end, the guys get away with EVERYTHING! They don't get scolded for their actions, the one stripper they meet has a heart of gold, the 'bitch' of the story gets tossed to the curb, they make the wedding, everything seems to go right. For me, a guy, watching this, it's a cathartic tale of scruffy heroism. But what does a female think? Should the boys have ANY comeuppance?",8,1,2,5 October 2009
Star Trek," Re-Engage
","We know what to expect from a 'Star Trek' movie, thirty plus years after 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. Perhaps this is because the franchise has kept it all in the family up till now. The majority of films have been directed by people involved in the 'Star Trek' universe for years. The thought of an outsider venturing into the realm of 'Star Trek' and directing the re-launch of their precious franchise is enough to make a Vulcan's ears straighten out. I mean, the last time an interloper put his stamp on a 'Trek' adventure, the result was the Stuart Baird-directed 'Star Trek: Nemesis', considered a failure on all fronts.So, it's refreshing to see TV guru J.J. Abrams not just succeed, but overwhelmingly so in delivering a fresh, relevant and exciting take on a new 'Trek' tale. Even more impressive is that 'Transformers' scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzmann developed an ingenious device to appease long-time Trekkers and newcomers alike. Said device is a black hole that creates an alternate 'Trek' universe early in the film. This allows the filmmakers to have fun with shades of the 'Trek' characters we know and love, yet gives them a chance to re-make and re-discover them in a new adventure. It's a great story design and that rare occasion where a time travel story has no glaring flaws. 'Back to the Future II', a movie that is built on traversing space and time, had a major error in its depiction of time travel* and even another 'Star Trek' film, 'First Contact', mishandled time travel*. But if you follow the characters of this movie in and out of wormholes, go home and draw out a schematic diagram of exactly what happened, it make sense! The plot details involve Spock traveling back in time on the heels of Romulans, who are convinced Spock caused the destruction of their home planet. The Romulans are bent on revenge and destroying Vulcan with a mysterious substance called Red Matter. At this point in time, youthful Kirk, Spock, Bones and the rest of the crew are getting their feet wet on the bridge of The Enterprise after the original Captain, Christopher Pike, is captured by the Romulans.The tech aspects of the movie are top-notch, killing the old notions of cheesy FX that have haunted this franchise in the past. Also top notch is the casting, succeeding in many different ways. Chris Pine as Kirk brings the right machismo and sense of humor to rival straight-as-an-arrow, logic-based Zachary Quinto, nailing the role of Spock. The early-relationship standoffs between Kirk and Spock are a lot of fun, almost playing out like the romantic comedy couple who hate each other that you know will be together in the end. There is romance in this film that wakes Trek fans out of the coma they've been put in by Picard's stodgy relationships (he deserved sexier times). There's a romantic liaison between Spock and Uhuru (a concept straight out of 'alternate universe') that works as a romance and for comedy fodder as something else to come between Kirk and Spock. Karl Urban has his best role since 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy as 'Bones' McCoy. His role isn't as re-imagined as some of the others, instead, he flavors his role with the best parts of DeForest Kelley's original portrayal, to hilarious effect.Eric Bana does a fine job as the revenge-bent Romulan, reminding audiences that a real THREAT is essential to an adventure movie. Once the threat is real and potent, a movie can have all sorts of fun underneath that umbrella, and 'Star Trek' does. Take note, Indiana Jones. In fact, George Lucas, why don't you give J.J. Abrams a call",10,3,11,5 October 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Triumph of the Will
","Quentin Tarantino DARES you to like his new movie, to the point where he'll trash any conventions he sets up, kill off any characters he wants, stray from a storyline for an eternity, cross-pollinate genres and styles and basically give the audience the 'ol 'Fuck you, I'm making MY movie, come along if you want, but I don't need you.' Such searing macho bravado is annoying in the hands of other directors (this was pretty much Michael Bay's stance making 'Transformers 2' – 'If I want a hot chick Transformer, I'm gonna do it, sensibility be damned!'). With Tarantino, I was IN early on, and stayed hooked for 153 minutes.Tarantino mastered a dialogue style in 'Pulp Fiction' that I find brilliant – the anticipation of violence. When Jules and Vincent start talking about European food, the dialogue is fun and engaging. When they stop and get guns out of the trunk, there's obviously something more at work here then guys driving, talking about Le Big Mac. What they're doing is, however, delayed and delayed for more banter. They talk about T.V. pilots, they talk about foot massages, they even get to the door where SOMETHING is going to go down, and they pause even further to 'get into character'. The scene is fascinating, with whip-smart, funny dialogue, and it all feeds into the violent payoff like a symphony reaching its grand chorale. I say this is a Tarantino style, 'cause he's certainly employed it again ('Kill Bill, Vol. 2' – The Bride meets Bill and they talk and talk before ever getting down to business, but the talk is electric and soaked in history).'Death Proof' had A LOT of talk, and, to me, wasn't as effective because there was nothing underneath the chatter. It was just that, a lot of chatter for the sake of being hip. In 'Inglourious Basterds', Tarantino's new World War II epic, the film opens with a 'Once Upon a Time in the West'-style meeting between a Nazi officer known as The Jew Hunter and a French man accused of hiding Jews in his home. Right away, the gamesmanship displayed was masterful, both actors steadily at odds, and the sociable dialogue masking the tension and intention of its characters. To see Tarantino deliver an opening scene so solid, controlled and authoritative meant the 'glourious' return of a director who I thought was delving into the excess pool a bit too often in his last few projects.But then, just when you get a handle on the movie, he'll do whatever he feels like doing again. 'How's about DIRK DIGGLER-esquire on-screen text to introduce one of the characters? You like Sam Jackson? I got him, for no reason other than we're friends. Has Mike Myers been in too many lousy movies lately? I'LL CHANGE THAT.' The balls on this guy! And yet, it's conveyed with such audacity, it ends up wildly entertaining.Think about the title of the movie: 'Inglourious Basterds', a group of Nazi-hunters in WWII. But we don't meet them until after that brilliant opening scene. Then we get a taste of the Basterds, but QT has other stories to tell. We meet an escapee from the opening scene who now owns a movie theater, and the Nazi soldier who is smitten with her. We meet a British soldier who gets new orders to be part of Operation Kino, and we get to see the operation in full effect (and ANOTHER scene where we wait and wait for the violence as layer after layer of the tavern-goers gets peeled away in deliberate conversation). So, if we're going to be sidetracked from Nazi scalp-hunting, Tarantino better bring the goods. This is where the film keeps our attention because the stories intertwine, and a true, can-they-pull-it-off narrative kicks in with an infusion of patented Tarantino energy.Universally thought to steal the show in this movie is Christoph Waltz as Colonel Landa, The Jew Hunter. He does a great job of playing Nazi soldier as charmer, counterpunching with smarts. He is the real bastard. Tarantino gives him an interesting shift in paradigm near the end of the film that is bold and intriguing, but not wholly satisfying. Brad Pitt is good as Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds, often eliciting laughs from his no-nonsense approach to killing NAH-ZIS. Diane Kruger is good in the complicated role of actress Bridget von Hammersmark, an otherwise high-class citizen who finds herself ingrained in dangerous war scenarios. She also has the line of the movie: 'Do you Americans speak any other language than English?' Much has been made of the end of 'Inglourious Basterds', and I have to admit it was a little surprising, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility, given the way the film built to the end. Stops were pulled out, extremes were explored, so why not just GO FOR IT? But even in a pulse-pounding finale, there's pause to be had watching Jews enact revenge on Nazis in a blood-soaked fashion similar to that employed by the Reich itself. The climax is a blazing, cinematic extravaganza, and when layered with thought-provoking imagery and haunting ghosts dancing in the smoky light of a movie projector, the result stays with you longer than a baseball bat to the head.",9,2,17,5 October 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Jedi Warriors
","'The Men Who Stare At Goats' opens with a sentence on the screen, 'More of this is true than you would believe', and indeed that seems likely, depending on who you are. It's a glib introduction, but it also has an extra element of self-conscious awareness. The story is so inherently weird and subjective that believing it completely would be somewhat foolish. A movie about this particular series of events couldn't possibly be 100% accurate, and 'The Men Who Stare At Goats' is not a film that is overly concerned with trying to portray historical facts. The opening sentence is a warning for the audience, that things like this can't be perfectly explained.Ewan McGregor plays Bob Wilton, a reporter at a small newspaper in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He finds himself recently cast aside by his wife and in need of distraction, if not complete rebirth. He finds the first, and possibly the second, rather accidentally, in Kuwait City in the form of Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a former Special Ops military man. Bob had recently written a newspaper story about Gus Lacey (Stephen Root), a man who claimed to have psychic powers of his own, as well as knowledge of the US Army's involvement with psychic research and the possible military applications of such capabilities. From that story, Bob recognizes Lyn Cassady's name as someone who was also involved in the program that Lacey described to Bob. Wilton attaches himself to Cassady at this point, and Cassady leads Wilton down the rabbit hole, through the Iraqi desert, and into a crazy world of Military Intelligence, the classic oxymoron.Cassady explains himself as having been the most successful psychic soldier, a 'Jedi Warrior', in fact, of a program in the US Army called the New Earth Army. The NEA was the brainchild and proposition to the Army of Bill Django (Jeff Bridges, perfectly cast), a Vietnam veteran and new age hippie. Django is the most unlikely of soldiers, and he guides his troop of men through various exercises to attempt to create a peaceful army for the new millennium, using the power of positive energy, psychic strength, and dancing. Yes, dancing. If the history of this bizarre story is to believed, a group of Army soldiers danced together regularly, in uniform, on a military base, in a free-form style, to rid themselves of inhibition in order to become more powerful soldiers of love and good mojo.This was back in the 1980's, the Reagan era, and President Reagan himself was said to be a supporter of this kind of research. It seems the Soviets were themselves attempting to employ psychic powers to gain an advantage in the cold war or perhaps to end it, one would assume and our side didn't want to fall behind on a potentially ground-breaking front.Clooney plays Lyn Cassady sympathetically, as a man convinced of his own supernatural ability and driven by a desire to do good and perhaps help reform the Army, if not the human race, through the techniques and belief system he has committed his existence to. Cassady is not a young idealist any more, as the bulk of the movie takes place in the early part of this decade, years after the New Earth Army has dissolved and given way to the Bush era. The current administration is attempting to use some of the techniques and findings of Django and Cassady for torture and other nefarious practices. You may have heard of the Army using the music of the big purple dinosaur Barney as a torture device against captives in Iraq. That's one of the things that Cassady refers to as part of 'the dark side'. Cassady is an aging idealist, and he sees Bob Wilton as a tool for redemption a man who can tell Cassady's story to the world. Cassady is, in the frame-work of the film, a mystifying figure; insane or brilliant, pathetic or heroic. Clooney deadpans the part as he must, since any over-playing of Cassady's cards would almost certainly betray the man as a buffoon and a liar. And anyway, George Clooney doesn't know any better than you or I do, even after seeing the movie, what is real and what is not.But that's beside the point, or perhaps it is the point. As Clooney and McGregor (our former Obi-Wan is hilariously confused about the way of the Jedi) tumble through this movie, almost nothing factual becomes clear. We see some desperate men in the process of trying to do some good running up against the standard problems that confront such people the will of those in power who do not concern themselves with morals, but rather attempt to 'succeed' and 'win' at any cost. There is a hilarious scene wherein two security companies full of soldiers-for-hire, all of US origin, accidentally find themselves in a firefight sparked by misunderstanding and machismo. It is classically FUBAR (a military term for screwed up), and as Clooney, McGregor and an Iraqi man they have recently befriended skip out of the skirmish ('my house is near here', says the Iraqi), the message is simple: Fear and aggression are powerful forces that can consume anyone, and good mojo and innocence are easy targets. Sometimes it's best just to get out of the way.'The Men Who Stare At Goats' is a sad yet somehow triumphant tale of good persevering over evil, if only in the hearts and minds of a few fairly powerless humans. In our time, in this crazy, mixed-up, violent and fearful world, what else do we have, anyway? Love, dancing, and the movies",7,3,5,29 November 2009
The Hurt Locker," War is a Drug
","'War is a drug' are words among the first to appear on screen in Kathryn Bigelow's extraordinary new film, 'The Hurt Locker'.DRUG (n): An often illegal and sometimes addictive substance that causes changes in behavior and perception and is taken for the effects.The main character in 'The Hurt Locker', Staff Sgt. William James, a bomb diffuser, enters the story after his team's previous bomb specialist dies in action. Death in the line of duty doesn't deter Sgt. James. War for him is addictive, and he participates for the effects (I'll leave it up to you as to whether you think the war is 'illegal'. Even the film shies away from political grandstanding).'The Hurt Locker' is about Sgt. James and the team assigned to protect him and work alongside him as they scour Iraq for IEDs and other hidden explosives. Documentarian Ken Burns, in creating his recent series 'The War', mentioned once that a big difference he found between the World Wars of the early 20th century, and the current war in Iraq is the mission. In World War II, soldiers fought for the cause – fight off Japanese oppression, end Nazi occupation, etc. Today, in an era when the overall mission can be unclear, soldiers fight for the man or woman next to them on the front line. In the case of 'The Hurt Locker', that leads to a very complicated and sticky relationship.Routinely under-heralded Anthony Mackie plays Sgt. Sanborn, head of the team that goes into the most dangerous zones of the war to uncover and diffuse bombs hidden in the ground, in the walls, in cars, nearly everywhere. Sanborn is counting the days until he leaves the desert, certainly a different mindset than war-addicted Sgt. James., yet it's clear that he and Sgt. James would die for each other. That male bond is brought vividly to life by director Bigelow. She doesn't employ tricky effects like David O. Russell did with his brilliant but different 'Three Kings', her direction is more drenched in reality, one I would never want real for me. Jeremy Renner plays Sgt. James with a fiery deliberateness, and he referred to Bigelow's direction as that of 'a voyeur'. This is a great asset to the film. The movie has top-notch production value, but never announces it. Instead, we get a very credible relationship drama about people under intense pressure.The film was written by Mark Boal, who wrote the great and very underrated 'In The Valley of Elah', also about the Iraq War. That movie (and other Iraq-themed films) tanked, but I'm glad Boal remained undeterred and continued to write about the war. It's paid off, as 'The Hurt Locker' is a money-maker, and is destined for Academy Award consideration. An acting teacher of mine often praises work in class when the relationship is 'complicated'. Too cut and dry, too easily-explained, and we're bored. Boal nails the complicated world of an Iraq soldier, who balances grief, fear, anger and exhilaration on a daily basis. They make life and death choices for themselves and others over and over again. 'The Hurt Locker' is the first film to really portray Iraq as the most dangerous place in the world. Nearly everyone these soldiers come across could be guilty of planting bombs. Is it because they hate Americans? Is it because they are tired of Americans in their country? Do our soldiers belong in harm's way? Are they keeping peace? The end resultis complicated.SPOILER TALK: How great is it to see Ralph Fiennes in the middle of all this? Then he gets offed. Same with Guy Pearce, as if to say, 'Yeah, we're an indie film. We don't need no stinking movie stars!'. The scenes near the end of the film are a true masterstroke for Boal and Bigelow. Sgt. James returns home and slides right back into cushy family duties like cleaning storm drains and shopping at a horribly bland grocery store bathed in bright light. I suppose we take those situations for granted as being safe and most likely we are happy to do them. Drumming out our little existence in our little corner of Earth is the goal of most people. But, damn, if 'The Hurt Locker' didn't make normal life seem DULL.",10,54,86,5 October 2009
Up," Batting .1000
","Surprise, surprise, Pixar has made a wonderful film. 'Up' is a true original, loaded with unique characters, outstanding design, and some wild, vertigo-inducing action. Through it all, the Pixar brand of wit and humor is fully intact. John Lasseter and his team have chosen another rather risky project for a Memorial Day weekend release: an old man ties balloons to his house to travel to a South America, a location he's desired to go to since his youth. Outside of 'Gran Torino', this is the only film that's taken a risk on putting an octogenarian front and center of a potential blockbuster. But 'Up' gives it's lead a real warmth and humanity that is all but missing in Hollywood's general portrayal of the elderly, who, when not pointing shotguns at the local hoodlums, are normally the butt of the joke.'Up''s main character is Carl Frederickson, and Pixar deals a masterstroke in telling his backstory in an remarkable montage set to Michael Giacchino's dazzling score (Giacchino scored both 'Star Trek' and 'Up' and deserves an Oscar for the love of god – he was unfairly passed over for his GREAT 'The Incredibles' score years ago). The montage of Carl's life elicits laughs, tears and strongly establishes why Carl is doing what he's doing. The house with balloons is as memorable a cinema icon as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or Dorothy's house flying through the tornado. But it's the reason for Carl's quest and the metaphor of the house as the baggage he's carrying that makes the story of 'Up' go from memorable to truly magical.The voice talent is strong throughout, and like 'Wall-E' before it, there are no superstars driving the show. Ed Asner's voice brings all the weight of his years to Carl, and he's matched pitch-perfect by Christopher Plummer. In a hilarious turn, young Jordan Nagai kills as the Explorer scout constantly bothering Carl. 'Up' has been shown in 3-D, and I get why theaters are doing that. With pay-per-view, on demand, online, blu-ray and DVD options for people to see a film, the in-theater option is pulling out all the stops to get you to come out and spend up to $14. But 'Up' is so strong in character and narrative, there's no need to add the special effect of exploring the third dimension. An added plus, for sure, but not necessary. 'Up' excels in its animation, robustly coloring every frame, whether it's with thousands of individual balloons or the painter's palette worth of color on a unique South American bird.'Up' also fires up the Pixar humor to uproarious effect. Particularly funny are a pack of dogs who 'speak' through collars that read their thoughts. The combination of the absurd and the direct translation of a dog's actions into words make for some pretty funny stuff. They also get a lot of mileage out of Carl's grumpiness, without making him unlikeable.Gush time. Pixar makes the best films in Hollywood right now. An eclectic mix of top acting talent, dazzling animation, inventive and risky storytelling, every time. Next up, they're re-distributing 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2' this fall in 3-D. Again, whether the 3-D is necessary is debatable, but it'll be great to re-watch the first feature length film that put Pixar on the national map. They came out of the gate so strong, it's amazing that they've managed to see the possibilities in risky plots and never waiver from a formula underneath that is the most watchable cinema out there.",10,1,4,5 October 2009
Zombieland," Love it
","'Zombieland' is such a fantastic ride, it is hard to find fault with it. The first five minutes with the opening sequence and credits set up the exact style of this film. You know right off the bat that it's funny, quirky, scary, gory, and a new bend on an old idea. It is a wonderful black comedy, so much so, that you will be hard pressed to predict moment after moment.Seldom is violence so entertaining. Other than Nazis, zombies are the perfect enemy. They live, only to kill, completely devoid of any positive trait. So, watching shot after shot of zombies getting their comeuppance is satisfying on a colossal scale. The main characters (played by Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin) are constantly finding new ways to kill, dismember, squash, and destroy zombies. And watching it done has never been so enjoyable. Sure, at times the violence is for comedic effect, but elsewhere in the film it is used as a release from a genuinely tense chase scene.Furthermore, this means the movie is genuinely scary. This is not just a hack remake of the same thing we have seen a thousand times before. This is fully new and inventive. From moments full of heart pounding tension to moments that make you jump, the movie does not disappoint. There were several audible gasps, screams, and guffaws from the audience throughout the film.Also, seldom do you find a touching love story in a zombie movie. Since, zombies, by their very nature are thoughtless, irrational creatures that are void of any emotion other than rage; you would not expect any hint of a romantic storyline. Furthermore, most zombie movies are hell bent on inspiring fear. So, to find an emotion connected to a zombie film that is even remotely connected to an inspiring heartfelt one is almost absurd to imagine. Yet, they are able to create one here. I give total kudos to writers, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who so poignantly point out the true difference between the walking dead and us as humans. In a world where zombies live to destroy and kill, we as humans still live to connect and build.Finally, it's nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the big screen in a role that allows him to play cocky, brutish, and stupid: three characteristics worthy of 'Zombie Killer of the Week'. Eisenberg also steps up his game, proving that he is equal to his more popular twin Michael Cera.While some may say that the zombie genre is overdone, I say as long as there are new and inventive ways to kill zombies, I'll keep watching.",9,0,0,29 November 2009
The Blind Side," Mind the Bullocks
","When I first saw this trailer in the theater, I teared up. Something about it caught my attention right from the start. I know, I'm a sucker for an underdog movie, but I think I was welling up because I knew Sandra Bullock was going to kick major ass in this movie and I was right. (Oh, and she looked hot as hell too!) Let's not beat around the bush, I loved this movie. I had no idea that it was based on a true story until the end when I saw footage of the real Michael Oher. I don't really like sports movies and I am not a huge football fan, but that's not what this movie is about. This movie is about doing what is right even if it's the harder thing to do.This is the real-life story of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) and their unlikely new 'son' Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Leigh Anne is a wealthy southern spit-fire who speaks her mind and knows what she wants. One night when she spots Michael walking in the cold rain without a coat, that's it, from that moment on, Michael's life would never be the same.Michael's father left when he was just a baby and his mother is a drug addict. Even though he is homeless and wanders from couch to couch, his spirit is never broken. He has the body of a giant and the heart of a lamb. He just needs a chance and thanks to Leigh Anne, he gets it.The love that Leigh Anne and her family show Michael is honest and real. I especially found the relationship of the children and Michael to be unique. I kept waiting for the cliché scene where the 'legitimate' children are jealous of Michael and all of the attention that he's getting. Thankfully, that never happened. I think that speaks volumes to what great parents Leigh Anne and Sean were. Their children learned by their example and did not pass judgment on Michael just because he was poor and from the projects.For me, the major theme in this movie was: What does being a Christian mean? How many good Southern Christians passed by Michael that night when he was walking in the cold? How many people go to church every week and give to the local food banks but would never pull the car over and invite a huge African-American boy into their car and, eventually, into their life? Leigh Anne Tuohy didn't even stop to think that she might be making a mistake until long after she took the young man into her home and tucked him into bed. That's a Christian who talks the talk and walks the walk.Oh, and who knew the movie would be so funny?! Tim McGraw (who was so believable as the husband that I didn't even recognize him) has some of the funniest lines in the movie. His performance is rock solid and he holds his own next to Bullock's fast and feisty Leigh Anne. Jae Head, who plays the Tuohy's son, steals scenes with his quick wit and enthusiasm. He's a perfect match to Michael's quiet, Ferdinand The Bull energy.So, could this finally be Sandra's ticket to the Oscars? I can't be sure of that. But I can be sure that this movie was pretty great, even without Bill Murray in it. (Who knew that was possible).",10,6,12,29 November 2009
Moon," It always feels like somebody's watching Rockwell
","Who could you watch in a movie if they were roughly the only actor in the film? It worked with Tom Hanks. 'I am Legend' was a hit for Will Smith. Could probably work with Denzel Washington and maybe Brad Pitt. Who came up with the idea that Sam Rockwell, eternally under-appreciated lead actor often used in supporting roles, could pull off such a feat? If you're a Rockwell fan (I am), you know he's up to the task. He delivers big-time as a harvester of energy resources on the Moon, who encounters an unusual, yet familiar individual. There are obvious tips of the hat to '2001' all over this movie, but that's a good film to emulate. Director Duncan Jones does a great job at establishing the isolation of Rockwell's character, Sam Bell, left on the Moon to communicate solely with order-keeping robot, GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey.Let's go into everything above in depth. 'Moon' doesn't pack the budget of a film like 'District 9' or 'Star Trek', but successfully creates a plausible Moon surface, lunar domicile and hi-tech mining machines. Its main asset is not in whiz-bang visuals, but in creating an eerie existence for its main character, Sam. In doing so, 'Moon' hearkens back to a not-often-visited form of science fiction – the thinking-man's sci-fi genre. Think of the great movies in this class – 'The Thing', 'Outland' and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'. That's good company, and 'Moon' belongs there as an excellent mood piece.Unsurprisingly, Sam deals mostly with boredom and restlessness as he finishes up a three-year contract mining The Moon for Helium-3. Space being a lonely place isn't exactly a new concept, but it's handled well here as Sam's reminiscence and longing for a return to his family is coupled with a mysterious (and perhaps nefarious) company that has hired his services. GERTY is Sam's only friend, but being a computer, GERTY is more interested in the tasks at hand than anyone's well-being.I know what you're saying, 'Yeah, that's 2001'. And you're right. I think the thing that makes 'Moon' unique is Rockwell. I think this film benefits from his status as a not-so-leading man. He can embody all the different sides of Sam Bell with equal ease and a great sense of humor. All that time alone on The Moon allows Sam to get to know himself, and he gets more of an extra opportunity than most of us. And as Sam discovers how Lunar Industries is using questionable methods to prolong his employment, Rockwell brings real pathos to his situation, and makes 'Moon', in the end, a moving film as well as intriguing science fiction.So, with all this praise, why not four stars? I thought the ending was a little abrupt. When such care is taken to build up this plot to the climax, I wanted a little more time with the denouementand a cigarette. Finally, all the homage, in the end, makes 'Moon' a touch too familiar to take me completely out of my comfort zone like 'Blade Runner' or 'Dark City' did. I think Duncan Jones proves with 'Moon' that he can graduate successfully from commercials to features, and in the future, he won't need deference to great works in order to make his own.",7,4,6,5 October 2009
