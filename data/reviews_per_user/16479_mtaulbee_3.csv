The Devil's Advocate," The most accurate depiction of Satan in a movie to date.
","While this movie does depict graphic violence and nudity and is generally disturbing, it is important to note that this is the most accurate depiction of Satan I have ever seen.  After watching this movie you might feel the need to RUN to church or just generally feel a little unclean, but for anyone wondering about what Satan is really like, this is a must see. Pacino is his usual brilliant self, depicting John Milton (no, not the author, but very appropriate for those familiar with Milton's writings). Keanu Reeves actually performs very well in his role as Kevin Lomax and shows that even the most ambitious people have their limits. Finally, Charlize Theron delivers a break-out performance as Mary Ann Lomax, Keanu's wife.  She quickly thrust herself onto the scene as the sceptical wife. Overall, this is a very good movie, well made, well acted, and very well directed.  For those who have a stomach for strong violence/sex or for anyone who has any curiosity of who Satan is and how he acts this movie is a must see.",9,1,1,11 January 2000
Ocean's Eleven," Fun Movie
","This was an enjoyable movie that deserves to be seen.  It is not deep, it is not an all-time great movie, nor is it one that is outstanding in any way. What it is, however, is a movie that leaves guys laughing and wanting to figure out a way to be as cool as the stars, and leaves women hooting for more movies with such nice 'eye-candy'.  It is fun to watch and should be a good lazy afternoon movie.",7,0,1,2 January 2002
The Green Mile," The Green Mile affirms Tom Hanks as the greatest actor of our time!
","While not his best acting effort, Tom Hanks once again delivers a performance worthy of the greats.  Mr. Hanks continues to prove that he is the greatest actor of our time, worthy of mention in the same breath as Stewart, Bogart, and Nicolson.  The movie itself is very entertaining.  A little on the long side, but the story assures that it will be difficult to find the appropriate place to use the restroom!",9,0,0,7 January 2000
