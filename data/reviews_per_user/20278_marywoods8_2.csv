Hereditary," COMPLETELY overrated
","I'm usually not a fan of paranormal movies without plots. I loved the Blair Witch Project and I found this movie not only to be a movie I don't like but I think others would agree but I know a lot of people really like it. I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the cast and their amazing actingPro's: amazing cast, good first 20 minutes, good actingCon's: confusing, no real plot, bad writing, incredibly slow after the beginning of the movie, the paranormal effects where pointless and not scary",3,0,2,5 March 2019
Gone Girl," One of those can't even get up to go to the bathroom kind of movies...
",Brilliant absolutely brilliant. From start to finish this was an all around great movie and is pretty much the film I'm always looking to find. Every twist and turn was completely unexpected which can be pretty rare in a drama/thriller...If your reading these reviews most likely you want to watch or already have and if your in the category of 'wanting to watch' DO IT!! You will not regret it!I really didn't think I would even enjoy this for some odd reason but after the first ten minutes that changed and for me to be able to say that that's a total plus in my book.p.s. for all the lovely ladies Ben Affleck and Tyler Perry are some serious eye candy to boot. Enjoy.,10,3,12,14 October 2014
