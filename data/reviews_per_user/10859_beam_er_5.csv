The Ring," Strong visual images ...
","The visual strength of this movie is its strong point. What I mean by that is the images portrayed are strong, striking and ones that will easily be remembered. Its a good thing.Why, you might ask?Well, the plot tends to revolve around these images. The images come from a VHS tape that one youngster described as someone's nightmare. Perhaps. Strange nightmare. But then again, nightmares are supposed to be strange.Was the movie scary?I found it rather disturbing in a very strange sort of way. My 14 year old son and my wife did not. I found it just disturbing enough to watch it again. All in all, I really don't know weather I would recommend this movie or not. There are some plot holes, the pacing is off, the writing is not bad. I did like the lighting and the direction. Approach it with an open mind. You'll need it to soak up the images.I gave it a good solid 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,25 March 2003
Troy," Distractions ...
","I have to comment on the distractions I found in this movie.
The main one being Brad Pitt.Ok, the dude is at battle, been so for days.  Knives, swords flying, shields pounding, blood, gore, and there is Brad clean shaven as all get out. Not even the beginnings of a five o clock shadow.Then his hair. Part of it neatly combed straight back and the remainder frumpled and wind blown. Distracting? At least for me, you better believe it.  Granted, at times he does get dirty and bloody, but through it all clean shaven at the very least.Oh, did I happen to mention that there is blood and gore in this movie?I gave it a 7 out of 10.",7,1,2,6 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," When am I supposed to go get popcorn?
","Pretty fast paced adventure. I managed to find a spot about 1/2 way through the movie where there was some kissing and hugging when I finally thought I could go get some refreshments and not miss anything. Good luck trying to keep up with all the changes, all the backstabbing, and all the fighting. Some rather amazing special effects.One thing that amazed me though was the way that the theater delivered the sound. It all came from the front of the theater, even though there were speakers all around the audience. I felt cheated in this regard. I haven't read weather others had this same poor sound experience or not. Hopefully. it was just this screwy place and that isn't how the movie is being shipped out. Then, 20 minutes into the movie, the sound level dropped and your hearing people crunching popcorn and slurping drinks instead of the movie. Grrrr ....Luckily, that just lasted another 15 minutes.All in all, a very good movie that I would highly recommend, but only if you saw the first movie. Otherwise, I am sure you shall be lost.",8,0,0,7 January 2003
Signs," I can safely recommend this movie.
","Tight, suspenseful, a bit scary ... I thought it was great.
A man who has lost his faith must rely on his choice of 'not wasting another minute on prayer' to get him through a very tense and nerve wracking situation. His little brother must try to keep faith alive for his two children.The adversaries are of a very unusual persuasion, kinda out of this world.
I can highly recommend this movie.",8,0,1,12 January 2003
Beetlejuice," There are scenes you will take with you ...
","Yes, its campy. Yes, its bizzare and strange and deviated way from the norm. Yes yes yes ...Over the years, I have had a love / hate relationship with this movie. Right now, I be in a rather forgiving mood.Michael Keaton is amazingly weird. The special effects are quite the trip and the sound was awesome. The editing is first rate, but the plot ... Sorry.What is strange about it is I sort of like the writing, the script at times very original and very funny. But that plot ... that basic story line ... I don't know. Maybe that is why I have teeter tottered about this film: So much good, yet an underlying strange badness to it.If your into bizarre horror flicks, then you might want to give it a try. There are positively some very bizarre scenes from this movie that you are going to take with you. Right now I gave this a barely 8 / 10. A couple of years ago, maybe a solid 6. Who knows next year or the year after.",8,1,2,16 January 2003
