The Ring," Intense but to many questions
","I loved the tagline (before you die, see the ring!).  And the movie definitely kept my interest.  But, there were to many scenes that didn't add up right - maybe that was my way of keeping from being scared out of my wits.I think it was mean to kill Noah off.  And give me a break on making a copy to save yourself.  If that was true why'd the girl in the psycho ward tell our herione she had four days left - she'd already made the copy.
The event dates didn't add up.  The Video seemed to be at the turn of the century (Victorian - even her toys were of that era), but mom and dad seemed to be WWII people. And then how did the girl get killed inland far away from her home and horses?   Also, what about the video being made of the daughter in the psycho ward - wasn't that before they had videos??I had a friend who finished watching the film, and when the TV went to static his phone actually started ringing.  Now that was scarry!",7,0,0,25 June 2003
