Marie Antoinette," decadence at its finest
","Marie Antoinette is like a banquet in terms of aesthetics. as Immanuel Kant commented on aesthetics, 'enjoyment' is the result when pleasure arises from sensation, but judging something to be 'beautiful' has a third requirement: sensation must give rise to pleasure by engaging our capacities of reflective contemplation. Marie Antoinette does just this. to begin, In the beginning scenes where,at the tender age of 14, she is given away, a rush of sympathy rises for this naive and beautiful young lady. It is indeed poignant to think she was literally stripped naked and thrust into a foreign world. her adaption to this brand new world is both furiously decadent and fabulously seductive to watch being played out. Coppola uses juxtaposition to emphasise her gaucheness yet beguiling charm, the latter of which really develops throughout the film.The soundtrack really adds to this muddled capturing of youth. Siouxie and the banshees compliments the sexy ballroom scene. one wishes they could be a part of this world. the whole production reverberates with a current of sexuality, with the innuendos passed around as idle gossip to the sensual sex scene towards the end. even Marie Antoinette's royal husband bares some element of attractiveness with his growing loyalty to his young wife in the progress of the film. the scenery itself cannot be forgotten. in typical regal style, every scene is filled with lavish mementos of wealth and power. from the royal paintings adorning the walls to the delicious gourmet cakes passed around at the parties, Coppola has let no opportunity for visual flair pass.although the character studies perhaps deviated from history's vision of the characters, Coppola really has painted a lively and powerful slant on all, mostly on Marie Antoinette herself. she is beautiful, kind, witty and a committed mother.as it seems with all Sofia's work, an element of pathos seems to lie beneath the surface. throughout the playing out of the film one cannot help feel this luscious lifestyle will play itself out with horrific circumstances. and so it does. the ending scene, with its beautiful use of light delivers one of the most memorable lines i've ever heard. it certainly stayed. dunst's acting was perfect for her role, with her impish yet reflective nature streaming through. This film really deserves its title. the film is not a comment on history. it is not a comment on the danger of indulgence. it is simply a tale of a delightful young woman in an enviable position who allows us a glimpse into her gorgeous yet sometimes difficult path. as she is driven away at the very end, one is sad to leave the fairytale that was her life.",7,1,4,15 November 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," top film
","The Hills have eyes..another potential cult classic from Wes Craven.The most striking feature of all to me is it seems to be a comment on the politics of the USA rather than a straight forward slasher flick.The main protagonist, Doug is a democrat and general Left wing looker. He sticks out like a sore thumb with the overtly traditional structure of the Carter family. Many references are made to manliness by the patriarchal figure. In the plot there are many clues given to the director's political opinions. Sutble references are given in the use of guns, dope smoking and the backdrop to the nuclear victims homes. In the opening scenes a mismatch of imagery is presented perhaps suggestive criticism of politics of the past.I am trying very hard not to give plot details away but there is a sense of unending in the final scene. However a conclusion is drawn to the politics of the under plot. The final scene suggests an optimism in youth of today and the freedom of choice when it comes to defining what a family is.But thats all politics!The film deserves much credit for the unbelievable camera angles. They really create a sense of creeping up, dread is approaching. The scenery itself is breath taking, remote and desolate.go see!",7,0,0,13 March 2006
