Walk the Line," The June Carter Story...
","Watching this movie made me realize how much Reese Witherspoon outshines Joaquin Phoenix. It's a well-made movie that shows no matter how screwed up and talentless you are, you can still make it big by hanging in there.... I'm talking' about Mr. Cash now.... I could never understand why this this guy ever got popular, so I figured I'd watch the movie..... After seeing what I presume is a fairly realistic portrayal of Johnny Cash by Mr. Phoenix and the scriptwriters, I'm left with an overwhelming impression that Johnny Cash himself was an arrogant jerk, with a childish temper and little talent. Kudos to the cast for singing the tunes instead of miming to the originals.... the early rock n' roll stuff is really good. A mistake I noted is that supposedly, back in 1952 when Johnny is buying a guitar, some of the models hanging in the store were not yet in production.",6,0,1,9 March 2006
The Mummy Returns," Nobody got older except the audience....
","Huh.... Sheer stupidity in a movie rankles me.... so the demise of both the kid and Brandon's grasping brother(Jonathan)would have improved the film....Too bad that there was not more of the Scorpion King(The Rock)in... especially in the closing scenes it seemed fairly obvious that computer generation ruled the roost....Imhotep's return was just that, but his date(Velasquez) was more evil....Same old, same old tricks by Imhotep, though somehow not as scary this time...The lovely Rachel Weisz is lovely and fits the role... Brendan Fraser could've slept through this... I saw no stretch for him from the first movie to this one, except excessive and inappropriate 'snogging', especially on the bus...I'm surprised Brendan Fraser's character wasn't a little more in control of his son, but I guess the makers decided they needed some sort of plot line, so they put a child in the line of danger to give some direction to the film..... Uuuuuurggggh!!!!! Am I the only one that found the boy's actions/interfering/meddling irritable? and Jonathan's continual self-enrichment program so unnecessary? I could only hope that Mummy 3 (if it gets made)can kill off the kid and his brother.... maybe they can use that as a story line with revenge for the deaths as the driving plot-line?.....Definitely NOT as good as the first Mummy film, .... by a long shot! But still watchable.",4,1,3,21 February 2005
