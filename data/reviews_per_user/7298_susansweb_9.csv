Vertigo," A movie that demands repeat viewing
","In the fifties, Jimmy Stewart made some movies that portrayed him in a not very flattering light.  The man that we saw normally playing the bumbling, shy yet great guy was now selfish, vindictive and had lost all faith in humanity.  These were great movies and his Scottie in 'Vertigo' is one of the better examples of this.  Alfred Hitchcock weaves a tale that after watching makes the viewer feel uncomfortable with their feelings.  For we identify with Scottie and understand what he does and why we might have done it as well.  This is why I think another viewing would be beneficial because knowing all the secrets allows the viewer to watch the movie from a more objective point of view and see how twisted someone can become.",10,6,7,27 August 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the greats
","After my family had seen this movie in 1981, my mother tried to break it down like the serials that had inspired it.  She had a cliffhanger almost every two minutes!  I had to disagree with her there but that example shows just how jam packed the movie is with excitement.  Almost the perfect adventure movie (marred by the grotesque finish), the movie features today's PC villains (nazis), great scenery and hair-raising stunts (the battle aboard the truck carrying the ark, is one the best ever).  One of the few movies that everyone should see in the theater.",10,0,0,4 September 2002
To Be or Not to Be," Best comedy - ever!
","Coming up with a list of the funniest movies ever, is pretty hard (there are so many to choose from) but this movie is head and shoulders above the rest ('Blazing Saddles' is the only movie that can come close).  This movie has got it all.  Ernst Lubitsch was of the few people that used the restrictive Hays code to his advantage with his extremely witty and suggestive dialogue. Jack Benny and Carole Lombard are great but I will always have to say my favorite person in the movie was Sig Ruman.  How he got most of the great lines over Benny, is beyond me.  Only Robert Stack got the short end.  Most of the time he was the straight man and compared to the rest of the cast came off looking a little stiff but someone had to carry the plot along.  I hate it when people say this but this movie is one that everyone should see.",10,5,14,11 February 2002
Memento," If you can ignore a big flaw, an enjoyable ride.
","In the beginning of the film, when I learned that Leonard (Guy Pearce) had no short term memory since his accident and wife's murder, I accepted it easily.  But then I got to thinking, assuming he was told about his memory loss after the accident, how could he remember that he had this problem?  To me, that flaw could derail the film but like Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffin, I just let it go.  The reason for the film's success is that by telling the story backwards, we are just like Leonard, we learn everything when he does and there is no way for us to piece things together.  This makes it practically impossible to figure things out.  In 'The Lady in the Lake', director Robert Montgomery tried to make the audience feel like the main character, Philip Marlowe, by showing everything from Marlowe's point of view.  It didn't work mainly because it was too weird to have everyone in the movie treating the audience like a character.  'Memento' succeeds where Montgomery failed.  As for the acting, Pearce plays Leonard a little too intense, probably the way someone would really act but at times too much for the screen.  Carrie-Anne Moss does nothing to distinguish herself and her berating of Leonard was embarrassing to watch.  Joe Pantoliano as the mysterious Teddy, has his best performance to date.  A film that will definitely make you think.  What would you do?",8,0,2,14 November 2002
L.A. Confidential," I just can't get over the ending -- too pat.
","One of the strengths of this movie was that it was an old-fashioned film noir made without any of the constraints that the old studio system would have required.  The old studios rules were that: good always will prevail (check), there must be a romance (check, in a movie as cynical as this one the Kim Basinger - Russell Crowe romance really seems out of place) and possible redemption (check, Kevin Spacey).  This wouldn't have bothered me except the first part of the movie was so good and was moving towards a modern (complicated and unresolved) finish when it was like the studio swooped in and said 'No, we better make sure there is a happy ending so we won't offend anyone.'  Oh sure, there is plenty of profanity and a big emphasis on sex, drug use and racism to give 'L.A. Confidential' the modern edge but where's that 'Forget it, it's Chinatown, Jake' finish?",6,3,7,22 January 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A great comedy that almost wasn't
","Thank goodness, Stanley Kubrick changed this movie from being a straight drama to what is considered one of the greatest comedies of all time.  This movie is chock full of great bits and one liners that one could watch it over and over and never get tired of it.  My favorite scene has to be Peter Sellers' President's phone conversation with the Soviet Union President over who is more sorry.  The line, 'Gentlemen you can't fight in here, this is the war room!' belongs right up there with 'Nobody's perfect' as lines that need no clarification.  One of the top five comedies in my opinion.",10,1,1,10 September 2002
American Beauty," Plain Awful
","If you think that among a bunch of dysfunctional families that the only normal happy one is the gay couple, is a clever comment on our society, then this movie is for you.  If, however, you think that the message is too clever and smug, then you are in for a movie full of these stupid messages. From the ridiculous image of the plastic bag blowing around that is supposed to mean something to the cheap ending, this movie has something to annoy everyone. In the future, people will be asking what was the big deal about Kevin Spacey?  He doesn't exactly have a screen presence.  I've been asking the same thing about Annette Bening ever since her debut.  And I'm bit saddened by Chris Cooper's part in this movie, hopefully it will be an aberration.  As for the rest of the cast -- forgettable.  As for the story itself, the message that living in the suburbs turns us all into soulless drones concerned only with material wealth and praise isn't a particularly new one and is a rather tired one.  If you have only been watching movies from the last five years, then this one may seem powerful.  To anyone else, the movie should seem like a first year film school student project.",2,0,1,29 August 2002
The Usual Suspects," Slick nonsense
","The more one thinks about this film, the more outlandish it becomes.  To me, this film falls into the thriller/mystery trap.  Create a bunch of cool characters, throw in a lot of swearing (I guess it makes them seem tougher) and then create a story that keeps boxing itself into the corner and then at the end throw in a twist so audacious that the audience in amazement at the filmmaker's arrogance will capitulate.  Well, not me.  I can't believe one bit of it.  Bryan Singer gets a good performance from his cast, the exception being Kevin Pollak who comes across a someone desperately trying to show how tough he is even though he isn't.  The film looks slick and stylish but sadly the ending is just too unbelievable to let me recommend it.",5,8,14,20 October 2002
Psycho," Still one of the all-time great shockers
","I was fortunate to see this movie at the theater.  Unfortunately, I already knew most of the story, so I could only enjoy the shocks through the audience.  One of those films that it is hard to talk about for fear of giving away any of the numerous surprises.  All I will say is that this film has one of the best casting jobs in history.  Everyone is perfect for their role.  Even though the description of the movie is rather bleak, there are many funny lines in the movie that are even funnier upon repeat viewing (Hitchcock has said that this was a comedy).  I even like the much-maligned ending; ends the film on a satiric note.  One of the best movies ever made.",10,0,1,19 September 2003
