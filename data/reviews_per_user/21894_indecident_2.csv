Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The funniest film I have ever seen, and yet still so culturally exposing
","First things first. Let me get this out of the way. This is the funniest film I have EVER seen. I went to see it last night, and I didn't just laugh, it was the sort of laughter which has you jumping around in your seat. Warning, if you don't like seeing embarrassing cringe humour, then this movie will be painful for you, but if you don't see it you are missing out.Borat's greatest strength is the fact that while the movie is more than capable of delivering a string of belly laughs with daft humour and fictional scripted bits, it draws mainly upon having the American public making asses of themselves and delivering the humour for on its behalf, much in the same way the TV programme did of the British public. For all its humour though, it exposes a shocking amount of prejudice, racism and down right barbarism amongst some people in America, and that is the beauty of this film.The ability to have you rolling around on the floor in laughter one second, and then have you gasp in horror at some of the comments made by some people Borat talks to in the film. This film has its lovers (me for example) and its haters. To me the only people who could hate this film are the people who identify with the narrow minded fools that Borat seems to seek out in the film.This film is quite simply a work of genius, and Borat far overshadows Sacha Bora Cohen's other characters. Rip roaring laughter coupled with political significance make this a winner.",10,2,13,15 November 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Where's my control pad?
","Now, whenever I say this movie is crap, I usually get told that it is just not my thing. However, I DID like dead mans chest.Here is the problem. I spent 90% of the movie wondering what the hell was going on, and not in the good 'I wonder what will happen here' way. They threw too many conflicts in at once, and you spend the whole movie trying to decipher who is screwing who over, though it wouldn't spoil it to say it is predictable that the good guys will be good guys in the end.All this film seems to be is an exercise in how good CG can be in a film, and as my summary suggests, there is only so much CG I will endure without having an Xbox pad in my hands. Visually it is fantastic, but it is all for nought when there is no story. The only plus side for me is that Johnny Depp is once again brilliant as Jack Sparrow, although even then (and this is not Depps fault at all), the character flip flops between being a coward and having balls of steel in a heart beat.The longest 3 hours of my life.",3,1,3,28 May 2007
