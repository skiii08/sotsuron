Come and See," Brief Review of the film in general
","If your from Russia this is your go to film to best represent your country. Ahead of its time, this movie truly displays the horror of war and how everyday innocent people get caught in its deadly grip. The primary feeling one will get when watching this movie is complete shock. The fact that this event took place, and in this manner is horrifying. This one of those films that really brings past horrors to life. The director's imagery is sensational and the on location filming as done with perfection. I get the feeling that the director does not really care if we focus on the plot, as much as the overall tone and themes he presents. I will not give details about the film, you must see it for itself. It will speak volumes. Be prepared to not be in the best mood when its over as this will hold water with you for the rest of that day.",10,1,1,8 December 2011
