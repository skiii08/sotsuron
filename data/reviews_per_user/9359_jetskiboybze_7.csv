The Equalizer," DOESNT GET A TEN COS ITS NOT MAN ON FIRE
","Just reviewed EQ2 so thought it was time to revisit EQ1. This is an outstanding trip out by Denzel, Marton, Chloe and Melissa with more than adequate support from the filler bad guys. Loved the side bars to keep the equalization trundling along. This film in my opinion, is so good I even watch on commercial full channels (along with MonF) which is not normally true unless a film beats my fairly high bar for excellence.. This one beats the bar by some height. The scene between Teddy and Robert in the restaurant was truly epic in its perfection so Kudos to Denxel and Marton for nailing it. Only minor niggles were the small plot holes and Roberts use of anything but a firearm for maximum death causing. Lets be honest, given his former trade I am sure he is more than proficient in stuff that goes bang at the pointy end. Having said that, maybe it added to the overall deadliness of our main man and perhaps JWs pencils could be added to the mix lol. In summary far better than EQ2 but hopefully equal to or even subservient to a prayed for EQ3. As usual, well played Mr Fuqua you excel in this Genre plus a good score that matched the films pace and ambience",9,0,11,14 May 2019
Wind River," Moving but inevitably saddening
",Renner at his best with outstanding support from the indigenous cast members. Moved me as a statement on the wrongs of current reservation situation. I hope it helps to improve the stunning indifference of policy makers. It should.An update to my review. I have now watched this film multiple times and have decided it just does not get any better than this. It is truly a phenomenal portrayayal by all concerned that deserves recognition across the board. It moves me on every level not least of which is the sheer quality of the acting by the indigenous actors. A masterpiece.,10,0,11,11 May 2019
Captain Marvel," Enjoyable Marvel romp
",Nothing outstanding but worth it for the early days of Nick and Phil. The outstanding character was not Capt Marvel but Talos played by Ben Mendelssohn. I have seen him before but he hasnt stood out in his roles but in this he was the undoubted star of the film for me. Altogether engaging enjoyable romp that once you get past the attempts to tie it in with the MU stands up well as a solo escapade. I liked it but it seems to have upset a lot of the ott Marvel Brigade because it didnt rely solely on overhyped dysfunctional heroes fighting myriads of cgi enemies. (Not that I dont enjoy those too! but sometimes less is as good as more so stop with the crying),8,2,5,17 July 2019
Aquaman," HOW DARE THEY TRIDENT STINGRAY!!
","Overall not sure about this film will have to rewatch but here are my first impressions. Started well apart from Atlanna Tridenting the classic puppet series Stingray! They're the good guys Atlanna!. Enjoyed meeting big boy Aquaman whilst taking on Manta,was a pretty cool opening action sequence. After that it got a little too much with excessive CGI and really too much going on for a single viewing. Dafoe was ok but not enough mentoring for my taste. Plot was overall ok except for the Duel with Orm. Aquaman was not getting his ass kicked to hard so seemed a bit cowardly to run away with Mera. Tended towards the cheesy in closing sequences but I will watch again to see what subtleties I may have missed in the crowded action sequencies. Momoa was very good in the part (liked him since Stargate Atlantis and obviously as badass Khal Drogo in the butchered GOT) Others fitted in well even an obviously aging Kidman (check out the facial wrinkles that werent covered well). I liked it on the whole and I am sure it will improve with each additional viewing. Hope you liked it too.",7,1,12,2 June 2019
The Favourite," CAPTIVATING FILM, RUINED
",A great film with an outstanding cast completely ruined by the godawful soundtrack. Continuous Farting would have been better. Whoever decided this sounded good or appropriate should never work again. I would have given it at least an 8 and thoroughly enjoyed it but couldnt get past the banal soundtrack that totally ruined it for me. Saddening,5,2,3,29 January 2020
Man on Fire," FILMS DO NOT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS.
","Truly Denzels finest hour in so many ways. I am not going to dissect this film it doesnt need it as it stands alone as a masterpiece of cinema history. I will however mention that the scene with C. Walken and the head policeman absolutely sums up everything that is awesome about this film. Support cast were outstanding and they needed to be to keep pace with Denzels masterclass of acting diversity. Hated the ending but it was the only way it could have ended so even though I was sad it was right on the money although alas it killed a possible sequel. Music, cinematography, script and plot were outstanding. Truly up there with accepted cinema masterpieces.",10,2,13,3 June 2019
Incredibles 2," Nowhere near enough Edna!
",Because we knew the characters the storyline was not good enough to hold my interest as the first did. Sadly failed to meet my expectations.,6,2,14,19 May 2019
