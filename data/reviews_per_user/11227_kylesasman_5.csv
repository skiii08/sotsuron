Hereditary," I'll tell you exactly why it's so horrifying.
","I can actually completely understand why some people perceive this movie as god awful (wont really explain that- not the point I want to make in my personal review) The first time I saw it I didn't like it but now I'm in love and just got this movie for Christmas. I am a giant horror movie fan and almost watch strictly horror movies, so you already know I don't scare easily. I want to tell everyone why this movie left me so unsettled and disturbed when I saw it the second time in theaters (no spoilers, no worries) This movie takes a family (which we all have) and shows all of them falling apart in the most dark, sinister messed up ways you could ever possibly imagine. And that's what makes it so real. We all have families and go through dark and tough times. You FEEL for EVERY character in this movie. The acting is one of the biggest reasons that makes the film so unsettling. I could not imagine a different cast, especially having someone else play the mother, Annie and the son, Peter. This movie seems slow, and dragged on at first. But the way the events unfold is ABSOLUTELY INSANE. Also, for one- there's hardly any jump scares. This movie is pure terror with brilliant acting, along with the fact that every time I watch it, I notice something new. People lurking in corners and strange places that I never saw previous times, terrifying yet sublte and quiet sounds and effects you never caught or heard before throughout the film. It's so simple yet brilliant. And let's not forget how the whole concept of this movie is messed up, with awfully disturbing imagery. I feel like if any of you are reading this review and you're not sure of what to do because of other negative reviews, just give it a chance! Have an open mind, pay attention to details. I feel that you won't be dissappointed. Enter the realm of hell that IS 'Hereditary.' Amazing, dark film. You will be horrified. Scariest movie I will probably ever see. 15/10.",10,3,8,25 December 2018
Hereditary," I understand both the hate and the love
","I understand the people who hated this film, thought it was boring and trashy. Yet I also understand why people thought it was deeply disturbing and phenomenal. I saw this in theaters with my dad. Let's talk about the people who hated it. First of all, I am someone who gets irritated when people laugh in the theaters during a scary movie. But, there were some corny things happening in the movie that genuinely made me laugh (some of Peter's crying made me cringe, when the mother named Annie chops her head off super fast, and when she floats around in the air when she is possessed. I actually thought it was so funny. Also, when I first saw this I had no idea what was happening. The movie is a little too unclear. I do remember being tired in the theater and maybe I wasnt paying fully attention though, but I remember telling my friends that it was so confusing that I wasn't even sure if I could tell them what it's about. The movie seems slow to people. BUT (for the people who love it including myself) I watched it again/looked some things up. And this movie is quite a trip let me tell you. Even when I first saw it, I did think it was quite disturbing and horrifying and was satisfied because I felt as if I haven't seen a movie that scary in very long, even though I genuinely laughed at some parts. This movie makes you uncomfortable. And the reason for that is because in this movie you're literally watching a family's relationship deteriorate to absolute dirt in the most insane ways possible. And most of us have a family we live with, and seeing the characters/family fall apart and seeing the people that are going crazy after all these horrifying and traumatic events happening to them is terrifying to me. This movie is slow at first but it's for the purpose of you getting to know the characters, so later you can be upset and disturbed, and in shock about how all of them are dying in brutal ways. And lastly, to me what makes this movie so disturbing is that 95% of the acting is absolutely superb. Especially from Annie, the mother and the son Peter. Watching Annie go insane makes this movie heartbreaking and so dark and disturbing. Take this movie with an open mind and go watch it :-)",10,2,5,15 September 2018
Hereditary," Really Not Sure How I Feel..
","So I saw this movie a few weeks ago and idk how I feel. It's so disturbing, scary and unsettling yet there are so many parts that tried too hard and I genuinely started laughing at the movie. It has its good scares but the plot? I literally did not understand the plot. No exaggeration- if someone asked me what the movie was about I would not be able to tell them. I didn't understand it until I googled it and I shouldn't have to do that. And it sucks, because minus the fact of how confused I was throughout the movie, the acting was OUTSTANDING. Some of it made me cringe but 90% of it was great. This movie also really really was quite scary. And I'm a huge horror fan and am not unsettled easily and this had me feeling some type of way. Just disappointing because of the all over the place plot it has.",10,1,3,10 July 2018
The Fault in Our Stars," What???
","This movie is awful. How can you sit down and watch a movie, where a girl with cancer is so obsessed with an author who wrote a book about what having/dealing with cancer feels like, when he has NEVER HAD CANCER. 'It's so amazing, it's like he really knows?' Wow. Idk about you but that sounds disgraceful to people who really have cancer out there. Come on man. I think thats messed up. You will NEVER know what something is like until you experience it.",2,0,2,10 June 2020
A Quiet Place," what...?
",Really not that good... disappointed and quite confused about the hype. Not even scary at all. Someone please tell me one scene that's supposed to be scary. Kind of stupid tbh. And im someone that can tolerate plot holes/stupid cgi but this one oh hell naw.,5,0,1,10 July 2018
