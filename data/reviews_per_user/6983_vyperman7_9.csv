Catch Me If You Can," Easily the best film of 2002!!!
","The film is based on the true life story of Frank Abignale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio)who proved to be the most successful con-man in history by being able to assume several different identities which included a history professor, a lawyer, a doctor, and a Secret Service agent, to cash more than 4 million dollars in fake checks in the United States as well as 26 other countries. Carl Harnatty ( Tom Hanks) is the FBI agent in charge of running the Check Fraud division of the FBI. 'Catch Me If You Can' takes us on the exciting and extremely funny cat and mouse chase between the two men.I have now seen both 'Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers', and 'Catch Me If You Can.' 'Catch Me If You Can' is a lot better, and easily the best film of 2002. The film succeeds on so many levels. The first is that the film is based on the amazing true life story of Frank Abignale Jr. He was the most cunning and successful con-man in history, and was able to accomplish everything he did before the age of 19. What makes the film even better, is the fact that it follows extremely close to the novel of the same name, written by Frank himself. The next reason is because of the direction of Stephen Spielberg. The film was paced extremely well, and even though the film is almost 2 1/2 hours, it never seems long, or drawn out. The set designs were also very authentic, and he managed to get the best performances possible out of the actors. This of course leads into the third reason of the film's success which were the amazing performances given from the cast. Leonardo Dicaprio has never really done it for me before. I love his films, but not him. However, he gave the best performance of his career. He is extremely witty and cunning which let him play the different identities of doctor, lawyer, etc so convincingly. Tom Hanks was awesome as Carl Harnatty. He will amaze you with the determination he gives to catch Frank. But he will also make you laugh with his Boston accent, and how naive he can be. At one point, Abignale is able to convince Carl that he is a Secret Service agent working on the case. Alias' Jennifer Garder, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and the rest of the cast were all excellent as well. Finally, the film is down right hillarious and fun to watch overall. I was laughing for the whole entire film, and I actually enjoyed watching Frank from one moment to the next.'Catch Me If You Can' offers an extremely accurate portrayal of Frank's Abignale Jr.'s life, outstanding performances, outstanding direction from Spielberg, and you will laugh harder than you ever have before. If you are having a hard time deciding to what to watch this holiday season, 'Catch Me If You Can' is definately a film that you need to see!10/10 A+",10,0,0,28 December 2002
Memento," One of the Best Movies Ever Made!
","Memento is by far one of the best movies ever made. It is a shame that it was limited to such a small amount of theaters. Finally a movie that actually lives up to the hype. Nothing is as it seems in this movie, and the audience gets to experience exactly what Leonard Shelby does. Plus the fact, that the audience sees everything backwards, only adds to the effect of the movie.Another great thing about it, is that there was finally a movie, that was not runied by a horrible ending. The ending actually made sense and fit the movie perfectly. This is the best ' who done it' film I have seen since Usual Suspects. I don't usually see movies twice in the theater, but I am going to see it again as soon as possible.10 / 10 !!!!",10,0,1,26 July 2001
Spider-Man 2," Definately better than the first film *** SPOILERS
","I saw Spider-man 2 over the July 4th weekend and I loved it. The special effects were mind blowing. The fight on the train alone was worth the price of the movie. Director Sam Raimi managed to have the feel of the first film, and turn it into something better. All of the actors did a fantastic job in this film, especially J.K. Simmons as Daily Bugle editor and chief Jonah Jameson. Jameson is such a great character, and I loved how he had more scenes the second time around. I also loved the fact that Cliff Robertson came back to do a cameo as Ben Parker in a dream sequence where Peter discusses his feelings on being Spider-man with his dead uncle. The show stealer however, was Alfred Molina as Doc Ock. He managed to turn the character into one of the best villans ever to be seen on screen. Like most villans, he starts out as an honest and nice man, only to wind up letting his emotions get the better of him.You could tell that Smallville creators Miles Millar and Al Gough wrote the script to the film, because there were elements of Superman in the movie, like Peter running and ripping open his shirt, Peter losing his powers and wanting to become human to be with the woman he loves, etc.. The film also showed the future of Smallville as well by letting us see a super hero's best friend find out his true identity to turn him into an enemy. The film definately had a Superman like feel to it at times. This is not a bad thing though, since Superman is my all time favorite hero.As good as the film was however, I cannot give it a perfect ten. There were a few things that bothered me about the movie. I just want to note that before I list my few complaints about the film, that I have not read the comic book. If the film follows the events that took place in the comic book, it is hard to hold them against Sam Raimi, because he was trying to be loyal to it.The first is obviously so many people finding out about Spider-man's true identity. I mean, it is one thing to have Mary Jane find out, as well as Harry. But, to have a whole subway car full of people find out, and then have them swear not to tell anyone? Also, as good as the scenes with Spider-man were, there were not enough of them. The movie should have been called - 'Spider-man 2 : The Peter Parker show'. Last but not least, is the ending dragging out. I think it would have been great to end the movie, right when Harry discovered the glider and the room with all of the bombs. That would have set up for the third film perfectly. Instead, you have to stretch it out to make sure Mary Jane runs to be with Peter at the end. As others have mentioned, it was also strange, that Mary Jane had a frown on her face at the end of the film.Overall, I would give the film a solid 9/10, and I highly anticipate the third film.",9,0,0,6 July 2004
The Usual Suspects," A Great Movie to be enjoyed by all!
","This movie is very entertaining!! It is very suspenseful and full of action. You should see this movie if you haven't already. It should be higher than 17 on the top 250. Kiezer Soze, Kiezer Soze! Kevin Spacey, once again does a great job. Gabriel Byrne is great as well. See this movie",10,0,1,15 March 2000
The Butterfly Effect," This film is very underrated
","Ever since I first saw previews for this film, I was excited about it. Anytime the subject of time travel is approached, it usually makes for a good film with the acception of the god awful Time Machine. However, the film did have the critics going against it, and Ashton Kutcher trying to play in a dramatic role. I finally got to see the movie recently, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the movie turned out to be. While it is not the best time travel film I have ever seen, it was extremely entertaining and suspenseful to see all the different lifetimes being played out. I really enjoyed the fact that Kutcher's character used his mind to travel in time and not a machine. The movie can be frustrating at times. In fact, after the first 20 minutes of the film I had serious doubts. Things would happen, followed by Ashton's Kutcher's character having a blackout right at the moment when an explanation was needed. This left myself and the rest of the audience feeling confused at what was playing out. But after the film gets over the initial speed bump in the beginning, The Butterfly Effect turns into a riveting thriller and everything is explained in the long run. The entire cast did a fantastic job in my opinion. While I still feel that Ashton Kutcher is not a very good actor, he did a lot better than I thought he would, especially considering the fact that he is known for being a comedy actor.One of the best things about this film was the ending. It was not your typical happy ending. While every character's life turned out for the better, Kutcher's character still experiences loss and regret by how the story turns out. I was very happy with the ending, because it actually manages to leave your emotions feeling conflicted, which gets you thinking about how things could have been. Anytime you leave the theater in discussion about what you would have done differently, it means that the film made an impression on you. That is definately something that The Butterfly Effect manages to do.I really don't understand the harsh treatment from critics. In Entertainment Weekly, the average grade for this film is a 'C-'. While The Butterfly Effect does have its flaws, it turned out to be a riveting thriller, with an original take on timetravel and an unpredictable ending.8/10",10,0,1,16 February 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Great Movie, But Ending Lacked
","Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It had great fight scenes and a great plot for the man to get his lost love back and a new one forming between Li Mui Bi, and the other fighter woman.  What I felt the film's down spots were, was when there was too much detail on how the princess and lo met, and the flying was a little but exagerated.  Plus, I hated the ending. Chow You Fat dies, and then the princess jumps off of the edge and flies away leaving her love behind?  It made no sense.  The whole movie spends time trying to develop a romance between Chow Yun Fat and the other woman, and then he dies before it gets a chance to take off.  Overall I gave the movie a 7 out of 10.  It had great fight scenes, and a lot of great special effects. However, the story was a bit slow at times and the ending sucked.  It is deffinately not the best movie ever, but a good one all the same.",7,0,0,21 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Very good... but slightly overrated 8.5/10
","I was able to see this film at the Midnight premiere on Wednesday morning, before it hit the theaters. While I did enjoy the film a lot more than The Two Towers, Fellowship of the Ring is still the best film of the trilogy in my opinion.***** SPOILER ALERT *********Pros :Great battle scenesSean Astin was flat out amazing as SamGollum was greatThe army of the dead was very coolAragon finally accepted his role as king.Arwen and Aragon end up togetherCons :No Christopher Lee!!! - He was such a huge character in the two previous films, and in Return of the King, he was simply written off because he had lost his powers.I was also disappointed with Sauron. He is the driving evil force for the whole trilogy, and he went down so easily. He stayed trapped within the magic eye. I would have loved it, if Sauron would have manifested himself so that him and Aragon could have fought it out. This would have symbolized the ultimate battle for good vs evil perfectly. The sword that was responsible for destroying Sauron was reassembled in Return of the King and given to Aragon to fight with in battle. It would have been very fitting, if Sauron would have had to battle the sword once again. Then just as the ring is destroyed, Sauron is defeated by Aragon.My biggest complaint about the film was the ending. It was extended unecessarily by at least 20 minutes. The perfect place to end the film, would have been when Aragon said that Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and Meri bowed to no one, and the camera pulled back to show the entire crowd near the castle. Instead, it just kept going and going and going with constant tease after tease. That kind of slowed the pace of the film down for me.
Overall :The film is not perfect like people are making it out to be, and the film is slightly overrated. But the film is very enjoyable, and provided for a marvelous film going experience. Peter Jackson should be proud of himself, because he did the impossible of bringing Lord of the Rings to the big screen.How I rank the Lord of the Rings trilogy :Fellowship of the Ring = 10/10The Two Towers = 7.5/10Return of the King = 8.5/10",9,1,3,18 December 2003
Back to the Future," Biff Is The Man
","Back to the Future, is one of my all time favorite movies.  My favorite character in this movie is Biff.  He is the best in number two, when he steals the kids's ball and says, 'Is this your ball, is this your ball, then go get it! Ha Ha Ha' I also love it when Marty is trying to get the magazine, and Biff sees him and tries to run him against the side of the tunnel, and says, ' That'll teach him' But the most memorable quote in the movie is, ' What are you looking at butthead?'  Biff is the man of the movie, and should be given more credit. In my opinion, Marty ( Michael J Fox), played his part well, but he was still a dork.",10,1,2,15 March 2000
Goodfellas," The Best Mafia Movie Ever
","I can never get tired of watching this film. Robert Dinero, and Joe Pesci are great.  What I do not understand is why Ray Liota's career did not take off better.  He does a great job as Henry Hill, and he has not been in anything exciting in a long time.  The way that this movie shows the mob and how it works is great.  A must see!",10,0,0,20 January 2001
