Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This one did not live up to expectation.
","The Phantom Menace does live up to its predecessors because the plot is very thin. The movie is both enjoyable and exciting because of the digitally rendered worlds you get to see. Yet, there is a lack of urgency because the characters do not have any real problems problems to face.   I hope the next one is better, but this should not be too hard to beat.",Null,0,1,14 July 1999
Beauty and the Beast," A movie full of character..
","This movie is an amazing piece of artwork. The animator's have magically captured the essence of each character and brought them to life. Belle is a strong-willed, but soft-hearted woman and the Beast is a beast in the true sense. The movie  asks the question, 'Who could ever love a beast?' This movie is made especially for those who have yet to fall in love for the first time.",Null,1,1,14 July 1999
Titanic," Truly one of the masterpieces.....
","A movie is well crafted when you fail to realise that it has been three hours since you entered the cinema. There is so much detail in Titanic but the detail never seems to overshadow the story. Which story? About the ship ? About the survivors? About the tragedy? There are hundreds of plots and sub-plots which all disappear when the Titanic inevitably hits the ice-berg. Then it is all about survival and the true character of people in the heat of battle. Finally, it is about generosity and selfishness.Cameron allows you to tour the floating palace and the sinking palace. You meet kings and peasants. You get to see an enormous ship and you get to see a tiny light in a dark , dark ocean.Truly one of the masterpieces....",Null,3,9,8 July 1999
The Matrix," This is truly a great movie and great science fiction
","This movie is certainly one of the best science fiction/action movies that I have seen in a very long time. Keanu Reeves brings that same energy with him that we saw in 'Speed'. The story flows from scene to scene , seamlessly and fast. There is almost no time to ponder the the complexity of the Theme, but then the on-line tutorial is loaded and everything is explained. Once, you understand where you are and what has to be done. It is action, action, action all the way.Definitely worth watching again....",Null,0,1,14 July 1999
Braveheart," One of the best movies of the decade
","> William Wallace is a common man with an uncommon spirit. 'Braveheart' > expresses all that spirit and courage in in a singular moment, in one scene. > In the midst of oppression and overpowering force, the drive and passion of > one man can change the course of history. 'Braveheart' in its explicit > violence exposes the viewer to the harsh reality of battle, to lies and > deception and inevitably to death. Yet, 'Braveheart' is not dark and > depressing. 'Braveheart'  makes a lasting impression >",Null,0,0,26 July 1999
Pocahontas," A different Disney Movie..
","I watched Pocahontas on video and really enjoyed the movie. The movie is visually splendid. Pocahontas is based on real life characters but is not expected to be historically accurate since it plans to cater for an audience spanning the entire age spectrum. The story-tellers and animators have collaborated beautifully, creating characters aimed at specific age groups, each enduring to convey the same message. The musicians and lyricists creating one of the better Disney musical compilations. This movie should be watched without the expectation of seeing the normal Disney formula in action.",Null,1,2,27 July 1999
