First Man," Stop changing USA history...
","I just do not understand how a Canadian actor who has made millions working in the USA can be ok taking a great USA moment like this and letting it be used by Hollywood elitist who are so out of touch with real American people and they think so little of them that they believe they can insult us and we would not only be ok with it, but be thankful for the lecture. you would think the freedoms they enjoy because of this country they would do everything they could to make sure that they would honor it as it should be. Just shows how spoiled and uneducated so many are, and their ignorance truly shines in the movies they make.USA has both good and bad history, but it is USA history and all of it is what makes this country so great. We celebrate the good and we remember the bad, so we do are best not to repeat it. This should have been a movie that Celebrated one of the Greatest moments in this Countries History. It was not a 'human accomplishment' it was a USA accomplishment, the whole space race was USA vs Russia!",1,10,26,29 October 2018
Casablanca," Old does not mean Classic
","I love movies and I don't care when a movie was made, I rate them on its substance. I don't understand people who say 'it's a good movie for it's time'. What? The time is now and u rate the movie at the time u watch it. And if it a movie loses something for you over time then that says a lot about the movie. So say u watch a movie when you are s teenager and you live it, but then watch the same movie in your 40s and think the movie is horrible, most likely the movie is horrible you just didn't know any better when you were a teenager.sorry but Casablanca is slow, boring and the dialogue is terrible. Now maybe the problem with most the older movies is the didn't have a lot of money put Into production, so every movie is like watching a play on the big screen. They relied heavily on dialogue, charcter development and good acting. Casablanca fails on all of these.",3,1,10,15 April 2019
Silence," Too Long to tell the story
","I have zero problem with a movie that is long if it has a lot to say to tell the story. This movie is 2 hours and 41 minute, as most of Scorsese movies are long I have never had an issue with any of them in fact as in the Godfather series I wanted them to be longer, each scene had something different to contribute to the plot and progressed perfectly to the end. Intro,char development, climax, closing. In Silence it was Intro,char development, then about 40 minutes of more char development that was repetitive to the point you loose interest and become desensitized. Then it finally hits climax and the close is about 5 minutes too long.So in the opinion of this avid movie goer of all types of movies, I gave this movie a 6 and more then likely would have been a 7 maybe 8 had the editor done his job and cut about 45 minutes from the film.",6,0,4,23 January 2017
