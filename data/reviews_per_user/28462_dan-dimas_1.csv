Blade Runner 2049," My Dislike For Sequels....
",".... is only second to American remakes of foreign movies. When Hollywood remakes international movies my house begins to stink.With that said, sequels are a close second and this so-called Blade Runner shows why. In other words, Blade Runner 2049 is contradictory (pretty holographic wife cooking meals and showing skin... yeah earth sucks now, take that off worlders... yeah what a hell hole) and just a cash cow. Ridley Scott has finally ran out of different video versions of the original to release and people are sick of the alien prequels and sequels he kept pushing out (they all sucked) and so he's back here.Get some integrity.",4,141,241,25 June 2019
