Your Name.," A film is very great!
","Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) tells the story of two teenagers with vastly different backgrounds. This may sound like your typical body-swap romantic comedy situation, but you may find yourself on the wrong side of the spectrum as this movie takes you into an incredible journey. With a storytelling so divine, complex, yet understandable, this movie captures the essence of what romantic comedy movies have lost nowadays, a heart and a charm to lure you in.",10,3,6,13 July 2017
