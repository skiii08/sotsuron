Hereditary," Argh - they told us too much!
","I think that if you like VVitch, you'll almost really like this one. It's one of those unique and different movies that's well worth seeing. It's quirky, shocking, terrifying and will make you very uneasy. And it stayed great until the very end when - they told us too much! If they'd left some things open-ended and subject to our own interpretation like VVitch or Annihilation it would have been perfect. Here's my recommendation. If you want everything explained in great detail, stay until the credits. If you want the unsettled and mysterious atmosphere of the movie to linger, wait until Peter goes to the tree house - at this point start gathering your stuff and start walking to the exit. Don't worry, there's not much of the movie left. But, don't exit just yet. A few more things happen, then - when you hear someone start talking, get out quickly! Now find some friends who did the same thing and discuss what you think was going on. It's a lot more fun this way.",8,0,4,21 June 2018
Us," Interesting Concept, Really Bad Movie
","Having an intriguing idea is great, but the director still needs to make a good movie. 'Us' just isn't a good movie.
It starts out with great promise. The dark and chaotic prequel sets the tone, followed by a family dysfunction dynamic that carries into the present timeline and promises to be an important and interesting part of the story arc. An early unsettling event provides eerie foreboding.
Then the unsettled becomes terrifying. The 'Us' seem supernatural, able to climb walls and outrun normal humans. The movie looks like an isolated, somewhat dysfunctional family facing mortal danger, with great potential to come together while depending on something in mom's background - or not. It's looking like Peele can really do horror!
Then it goes off the rails.
The isolated family idea gets tossed quickly as the story expands to include characters we have no emotional ties to. Then, the weird supernatural qualities of 'Us' suddenly and inexplicably vanish. The family tension theme falls away while the main characters become invincible, removing any real sense of tension (or interest really). With no good main character arc, you start wondering where this is all going. Unfortunately, it's not a good place.
Either a horror movie can have a mysterious, unexplained cause, or it can have a well thought out, carefully explained and integrated back-story that teases out as the story unfolds. Unfortunately, Peele achieves the worst of both. He spoils the suspense by 'telling' part of the back-story, but then leaves out even the most basic explanation why this could be remotely plausible or undiscovered. I spent the rest of the movie punching holes in the whole ridiculous premise instead of actually watching it.
The final 'twist' wasn't nearly satisfying enough to make up for this stinker.",1,33,53,1 June 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Incredible true story comes with a lot of fictional baggage
","There's much good about this movie, starting with Ron Stallworth's incredible deception of the Klu Klux Klan. Racism in all its ugliness is powerfully shown. There's a lot of humor at the expense of some really dumb people. 
Unfortunately, there's a lot wrong with the movie too. Most of this is because the director embellished the true story. I'm not a big fan of directors tinkering with what really happened in order to add their own touch, and then still claim 'based on a true story'.
The result of the tinkering is a very uneven movie, particularly in the apparently 'easy' parts of infiltrating the KKK and the 'hard' parts where things go wrong. The 'easy' parts are, remarkably, mostly the true story. Apparently this wasn't dramatic enough, so a lot of fictional 'hard' parts were added to build tension including whole characters and situations. That's bad enough, but the added parts often made no sense, such as having no real origin (like one character's intense suspicions) and no resolution to the dilemma presented - they just seem to go away, are forgotten or have no effect on the inevitable story arc. Many seem to have been thrown in only to make already duped people look even more ridiculous. 
The characters themselves are, with a few exceptions, just caricatures. It's not hard to figure out what's next since they do exactly what you expect.
Eventually the movie just got boring since it all moved to an inevitable and very easy to see end. Ultimately, the movie is maybe an hour of an amazing true and humorous story marred by over an hour of superfluous and poorly executed fiction.",6,391,635,20 August 2018
Joker," Dark Through and Through
","Joker superficially resemblances movies like Falling Down. But this one has so much more.
The movie starts out slowly. Very slowly. At one point I was wondering how long it would go on at such a slow pace. However, pieces are being carefully placed, seemingly unrelated, but definitely not at random.
Then the bomb maker has all the pieces he needs.
The explosion is unexpected and violent, a tipping point that triggers all the pent-up madness and fury. The slow burn start served to immerse us in this world so we can be engulfed and swept along by the flood. Events spiral out of control as the pieces slam into place. Reality and illusion blur. Themes of family, friends, mental illness, loss, deceit, and ultimately society's failure, crash together in an increasingly shocking ride.
There's nothing happy about this movie. It is dark, through and through. I rarely do this, but I'm going again tomorrow...",10,2,4,18 October 2019
Alien: Covenant," Not very good
","I knew going in that this movie has its problems. I didn't realize how bad they are. Good Things: <ul><li>Nice visuals and scenery: The spaceships look realistic and contribute to the confined space needed for parts of the movie. The planet scenes are appropriately alien with some nice touches. </li></ul><ul><li>Interesting story line for the next movie: While the main story is hokey the backstory developed for the original 'Alien' is engaging. </li></ul><ul><li>Good protagonist (mostly): The main protagonist emerges as the movie unfolds and is someone you can root for (mostly).</li></ul><ul><li>Fassbender: It's just fun to watch him perform his craft and this movie is no exception.</li></ul>Bad Things: <ul><li>Predictable: Just about every major and minor plot point, surprise, action, etc. is completely predictable. The plot itself moves in a very obvious direction but just to kill any suspense there's way too much extremely overdone foreshadowing. The movie is just boring. I actually considering cutting my losses and leaving since it's too clear what's going to happen. </li></ul><ul><li>Stupid, stupid characters: The characters repeatedly do stupid things which are essential for the plot to move forward or for them to die. It's not long before you just don't care what happens to most of them. They also seem incredibly poorly suited to space exploration or being part of a crew. </li></ul><ul><li>Backward Technology: For the future the technology has some remarkably archaic features like 'automated' systems that only remind the crew to do something instead of just doing it. If you've got a technical background you can amuse yourself by making fun of the movie. </li></ul><ul><li>Poor plot: Besides the stupid characters, the plot requires events and coincidences that strain credibility. The main plot seems to awkwardly unfold just to get to the 'Alien' backstory.</li></ul>I could go on but I suspect you get the point. In summary, this movie was two hours of my life I'm not going to get back.",3,6,12,26 May 2017
