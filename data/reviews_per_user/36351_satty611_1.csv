The Avengers," The Avengers are here..
","Hi everyone,just watched 'the avengers' at cine polis Bangalore and i got just one word to say AWESOME!!!!! throw away your weekend plans n just go watch this spectacular event(or should i say phenomenon) where earth mightiest heroes join hands to fight evil. Firstly i would like to salute Joss Whedon for creating a script in which every super hero had the right amount of screen space,none of them where overrated.The narration style was fast paced,CGI was top notch,sound engineering was pretty neat. For a post converted 3D movie it wasn't that bad at all!!!Especially the last 30 minutes of the movie will be best enjoyed in the 3D format and for people who hate post converted 3D...u can give it a miss. Performance wise...HULK took me by surprise(u ll know when u watch the movie). people JUST Don't MISS THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!THE AVENGERS are here to stay!!!P.S-THE BIGGEST SURPRISE ELEMENT ARRIVES DURING THE END CREDITS!!!ITS GONNA BLOW U OFF!!!",9,2,7,27 April 2012
