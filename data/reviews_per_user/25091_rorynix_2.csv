The Avengers," Good average superhero film
","The avengers is a good film and a never done before movie of an assembly of heroes.nothing like the batman trilogies it is a good enjoyable film that is clever of how the heroes struggle to work together and end up helping each other towards the conclusion of the film.the film is very well done until the end of the film that is pretty upsetting of how iron man was the only one who ends up saving the day and how the hulk is made to quickly end Loki (villain) by just slamming him on the ground. the problem also was where iron man was dead and the hulk quickly revives him by just slamming the ground and roaring and that is how iron man is saved.that was probably the most upsetting endings to a goo film but a horrible ending and a film that i was truly looking forward to that made me upset and angry not to expect great from the next, that is the rumours.",6,3,8,21 July 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," amazing and smart ending
","the movie gives you everything you have ever wanted in an ending and the story.It has a great ending focusing on the Villain Bane with his all up plans to end Gotham and how massively evil he is showing in the first 6 minutes of this film. Tom Hardy plays Bain fantastically with his voice that just fits the character he is playing and makes him sound corrupt ans sinful. although not as good as heath ledger who played the joker, he is still the mastermind of the destruction of Gotham and Batman!!!The plot becomes more and more interesting with Bruce Wayne, Alfred, Lucius fox and cat-woman who keeps you guessing until the end, Anne Hathaway who plays Catwoman is surprisingly amazing. it is also definitely the best in the whole trilogy.The intensity of the film is great as you think he is about to help Gotham and save the day it all just turns upside down again.The music is incredible and works with the film and the editing is done really well. if you haven't seen the two other films you probably should because they are also amazing and there is stuff in the film that are needed to know about from the other films.The ending is spectacular and Christopher Nolan gives you want you want for an ending.",8,7,15,20 July 2012
