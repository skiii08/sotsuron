National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Its Okay...that's it I guess
","The problem with sequels is that, when it included bigger stars or bigger characters like the President of the US and it couldn't provide justice to their characters. Sometimes, fiction becomes too fiction and people like me who thinks would think, 'oh its too fiction,' I know what I mean.The magic is lost, it becomes a moneymaking machine and the hearts know not to be fooled. Its good to include bigger stars sometimes but sometimes, bigger stars make things impossible, the scene becomes too known or familiar its almost predictable, and predictable things insult the mind and bores the heart.I am not saying the bigger stars here were not good, they were still great but the outcome is that it becomes centered on them (moneymaking) and not on the essential aspects.Unbelievable things are cool if they stir curiosity but a little bit too far, stir familiarity, familiarity is predictability, and predictability is insulting and boring.I would rate the stars ten out of ten even if some are not really that good but because they are who they are, the story three, script five, special effects six. In total, six point five.I forgot, this is a kiddie movie.",6,0,0,2 April 2009
Madagascar," Funny fun!
","I did like this kid movie, the plot was cool and the characters are funny, cute, and cuddly. If you're looking for something to warm your heart and make you feel good about friendship and the nature maybe, this is what you are looking for. Nothing smart or extraordinary to say, this is fun. That's it, fun.Chris Rock did great with the voice over his character, it was imanimalated-(or impersonated for people) well I almost believed it was the zebra's real voice. Lion was cute and no matter what he did or how the effects made him scary, he is still cuddly like the penguins. Very nice Gloria, she was big and beautiful well with my hippopotamus eyes I think she is beautiful, her charming voice actually suited her, and I think hippos are all males until Gloria. Giraffe, he is the funniest I guess, his voice groomed him- lame and lazy. The squirrels or guinea pigs are the weirdest Jamaicans.Lastly, the penguins are among the cutest snow animals in the world how many are snow animals actually? They are cool and funny psychotics.All in all, 7.5. It lacks murder, mystery, and blood thrilling actions. u.u",7,0,2,6 April 2009
Terminator Salvation," please just read
","terminator salvation summary the film started with dwight in prison, on death row. he was thinking deeply when his visitor- a woman inflicted with cancer (i don't know their relationship)- came to him to have his consent to participate in a genetics whatever research. the plan was to kill him and donate his body to the research agency. at first, he didn't want to but he was convinced by the woman after they kissed- that was the payment for his signature.the year was 2003. after everything blurred from his eyesight, the date turned to 2018- a post-apocalytic scene. it was after the judgment day when the machines and man had war- the war was still going on. john connor appeared, their team attacked a skype (machines) headquarters where they found human locked in cages like animals; they were in for TEST. later in the story, the humans were kept to be experimented by machines to be like them. more likely, like dwight who was human but his insides were not, he was made a human machine literally.so finding about the ongoings but unaware of the reasons, john connor went to the human main headquarter at the sea to ask what was the situation. turned out, they found something a signal that could disassemble the evil machines. john volunteered to lead the experiment of the signals.meanwhile, dwight woke up fifteen years later from his death on 2003. he met kyle during his wandering in the new world. although confused and not human (physically- inside), he still had his heart to offer him to feel humanity. they became friends unknowing of their supposed-to-be enemy-relationship. they got separated when they were attacked by a titanic terminator, capturing people and bringing them to one of their main headquarters for research maybe.dwight met another lady whom he saved from men eager to rape her. she fell in love with him, both weren't aware that dwight was a cyborg-terminator, destined to kill human. she brought him to their hq. outside the hq were magnetic-traps/bombs, dwight's body attracted them and triggered them for explosion. because of that, dwight was exposed, his intestines were not slimy, they were mechanical machines the reason why he didn't want to eat when he was presented food.he was captured by men of john, tied like an enemy but wasn't yet disassembled for questioning, they asked him what he was and he was convinced he was human until he saw what he was a machine a terminator. john and his men believed he was sent to the hq to terminate them all but dwight denied of everything, stating he was human. SHE only believed in him.SHE was in love with him, so she formulated a plan to help him escape. she let him go and they ran outside the hq, they were greeted by bullets and bombs. she was captured by john's men and dwight somehow escaped to the river. john went to him and they chitchatted. dwight convinced john that he knew reese, that he was taken by the terminators and locked in their hq. he promised him he would locate reese and help john get reese out from the skype, he could do that because he was a terminator himself, so it was easy for him to enter and manipulate skype. john let him go, giving him a device so they could contact each other.dwight penetrated through skype, went to the master bedroom and the computer told him about what he was, how he was made, etc. he was made to be a terminator, something they (who the f are they) created to (what?) impress humans. he also learned that the signal they-john's team- found on one of skype's hqs was a custom-designed device meant to trace the main hq of human. at the same time of his acquiring the truth, the humans main hq was visited by a strong terminator and annihilated the place.meanwhile, john was outside the skype waiting for dwight's text message as to where reese was. finally he received what he wanted and immediately entered skype using high-techniqued overriding device to open the gate. he managed to be invincible and reached the main building. dwight chose a path, either to be human or a machine, he chose to be the weaker form, human penetrated the mothercomputer and stopped some terminators, then smashed the screen with a table.he went to search for john who was being battered by a terminator. john somehow managed to get away from the machine and went to free the prisoners, including reese. he found the nuclear-potions room and wired the chemicals with explosives. the machine reached him and they fought. he was about to be killed, thanks to dwight, he was able to put a fight with the machine until they killed it. they made it outside skype, the planes were waiting for them and they evacuated the place. set the explosives to fire and watched skype went to ashes.reese was john's father, they stared at each other when they saw each one. his father was younger at that time, one of them was from another time, either john was from the future of reese was from the past.john's heart was failing because of the injury he received from the fight with the terminator dwight offered his heart to john, stating that. 'this is my second chance'. an operation done, john was saved, dwight for the second time had blurring eyesight.lessons: this is one of the rare movies that tells you, 'don't judge the person by his inside'. reaction: this sucks",6,0,1,2 June 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Good but not great.
","Surely this isn't a kid movie.I expected nothing from it so I wasn't disappointed or something, this is one of the movie I haven't heard about until I saw it on the list.I watched the movie, it somehow bored me, kinda.I skipped some bit parts, those predictable or unnecessary parts... although there were only a few scenes.The special effects weren't that much fantastic, some scenes could've been done better.Too violent, but it was cool actually.6.",6,11,24,24 April 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," I think people just over-rated this
","I'm sorry but I don't know why I don't like this. I like kiddie movies but I really wonder why I didn't like this one... hmmm... for me somehow, I think it lacks imagination. I don't know, just for me ayt...Maybe, I wasn't in the good mood when I watched this one. I saw it on the big box and I should be thrilled but I went out quiet and not too fascinated and I really wonder why because I longed to watch this one.Ooops... I need ten lines, I really tried to submit this one without too many things to say because as I said, I didn't like it, I am not suggesting anyone to not watch this or watch this, it's just that you watched this or not... it doesn't make any difference, I think.",5,4,9,20 April 2009
Bolt," Uhm, well, cool for the kids...
","The first minutes of the movie are actually dark; living into something you thought was real but was not. Bolt thought he was a superhero but he was just an ordinary dog- cute and cuddly and used. When I realized what is going on I kinda wished he was actually what he though he was. He was played really nice by the people he trusted, with all that busting power and importance- he was just a dog.But in fairness, this kiddie movie lifted up as it goes by. The atmosphere became the usual element of a kiddie movie which is adventure and fun. Animal cartoons 'anime' is a product of frustrations of the reality, when one rich person cannot deal with reality; he resorts to something like cartoons. No dogs can really talk; special effects on a living actual dog might be insensibly costly.This movie made me rethink a hero does not have to the big stuff heroes always do which was presented at the beginning, because all that big stuff hero thing are fake. (I'm talking about charities and pictures and media.) The real hero is the one who is not afraid of doing the right thing even if all the people turned their faces away from him. Like Bolt we know at the end of the movie.This is not another hero movie, this is presentation of reality. The hamster in a cage, the cat who at first abused the weak- lives in a camouflage, the actress, the birds, and Bolt. You know what I mean.",7,4,6,31 March 2009
The Mist," Somewhat Maybe
","This is the first time I have felt this way about a movie. This feeling lingered in me since last night, after I watched the movie The Mist. If I am a movie critic I say, 'Red Alert: Stay Away From This Movie.' The story broke my heart. Its fiction I get it, but its media its aim is to spread the words of whoever are words were.I understand it represents reality that humans are weak, brought by desperation humans will seek for answers even if contrast to their beliefs. I also understand the reality that there are no real heroes (except for good moms of course, it is also in the movie).What I am asking is that- what is the sense? After making this movie, what do YOU expect us to get? I was entertained until he killed them I went out from this reality and thought myself as him until he killed them I like hero movies, I like it when their characters were played by plots too good to be true but I don't think it's a good idea if the plot goes too far killing someone to save him from pain yet to come.I have not read the book yet, but if the book were everything the movie is I guess it's really painful how the characters' characters are being written. I thought about the book by Cormac Mc Carthy- The Road when the movie ended. Some people might say Mist-type of heroes are stronger but I believe The Road-type of heroes truly are.I rate this movie six for good acting, Mrs. Carmody really made herself hatable, good special effects, good-looking characters. The ending spoiled everything.",6,1,3,2 April 2009
Up," Wow: An amateur review
","WOW. Three-letter word that goes with phrases 'Damn Good,' 'Darndest Best movie I'd seen in quite awhile,' 'Impressively Creative,' 'Genius,' 'Extraordinarily Remarkable Inimitably Original One-of-its-kind romantic, adventurous, cute, mature, suitable for kids and kids of all ages 3D movie,' and 'Simply Great.' Also WOW for MNEMONICS. First, W as in Warmth. This is gotta be one of the rarest movies that contains most of 'natural progression' of life's warmth. What could one ask more from a movie that has a romantic side, a love that started from age seven or eight from two different persons. Then warmth of love that stood against gravitation of sadness brought about by natural mishaps that happen in everyone's life. This side of warmth that fosters with age. And then the warmth of friendship - one of the aspects that mostly will make a movie great. What more? Friendship that is developed between two people that belongs to both side of the extremes (as in age). The idea of a man who doesn't have a child, who is widowed, and meets a kid that will later on become his friend or more like a son is truly genius. It is warm and it is a majestic side of this failing humanity.Second thing, this has Outdone most movies failed to accomplish, both in IMDb ratings (currently seating at #26 in Top 250 Movies Of All Times) and Box Office grossing now at ($399,340,879). One of the many reason why this is so successful is that it incorporated a very original concept of an 'other world,' like LOST with the coolest creatures that never have occurred in most ordinary people's minds. The Robot Dog is brilliant... cunningly worth a million dollar for it's conception.Tackling again the base of the story which is the friendship between a person that is being taken away into a hospice home and a kid needing the attention of his father, and along their way into adventure, meets a friend Bird and a lame Soldier Dog... together against a menacing goal of someone with his illest intentions just to serve his ego. AwesOme.It's a short picture, less than two hours but it has tOuched so many sensitive areas of the emOtions of human. The part of the bird is a million dollar idea... her collecting food and even endangering her own life for her kids. Touching.W for this-is-not-going-to-a-Waste-of-time kind of a movie. Lessons here are genuinely thoughtful.The adventure is entertainingly delightful and enjoyable. This is perfect. Every moment is beautiful.(For critics) If you're one of the many people who are looking for something in the movie that would disappoint you, or you're waiting for something that would spoil all your enticed saliva... well, it's rare if you do find one (in this movie).",9,0,1,19 August 2009
American Gangster," Very Good...
","Was good, I liked it except its length maybe the behind-the-cameras crews thought would look more ass-kick if its longer. Well, a TTL story, most of its kind are lengthy- just to prove the point that the bad guys are actually good guys and some if not all the good guys are bad guys. This story is based on a real-life and the real thing is that the real thing is a lie, everything else are just lies- that's the real real life.The picture is good because it was created pretty fine, the air is what they wanted to tell us, it happened a long time ago when there was still the 'h' in humans. The story included crook cops and crook lawyers and crook businesspersons presenting today's humanity. Everybody is a crook because of human instinct called self-preservation.This story was world changing for America, imagine- a crook businessperson aided by a lawyer packed three-fourths of crook criminals I mean cops to prison or home? Oh I wish all crook people, the liars go to prison too. I wish in real life the good ones prevail, or the bad guys who turned good, or the good ones who turned crook and realize in the ends, they wished they stayed to be the good ones.Maybe a family movie, for the crook family so that they will see or realize the crooks sometimes loses. A family that stays together burns in hell together. A family that stays good together no matter what, remains to humans after all, and to be human is the greatest gift of all- not loving yourself loving yourself purports for self-preservation, 'between me and you I will kill you so I will live.' Denzel Washington was good, I like seeing a movie with him in it. He is so straight I wanna be like him.",8,0,1,2 April 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Wow, inspiring story...
","I wondered what IMDb people voted as the best movie of all times until one day I entered the video store and rented this disc called Shawshank Redemption.I had the weird feeling that I already watched this movie before but splintered into different movies/TV series like humph the heroes and the villains, the acting all seemed so weird, is this deja vu? I am a young person so I didn't know how great this was until I went to the video store Morgan Freeman is so good, the way he narrated his story touched my hypothalamus- he wasn't crappy nor unconvincing or sounded underpaid nor overpaid-but-underqualified. He's great in what he do, acting.The story's gradual exposure of Andy Dufresne's vulnerability was good and not the hurried type most story makers do to make the character big. He was mysterious and cool.Great great great!!! I don't know but this inspired me in some way. Weird again right?",10,0,0,6 April 2009
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Boring and exciting
","The show starts rather lamely and boring, predictable without the same sense the show had with the second installment. I actually anticipated highly with this one but almost disappointingly unappreciated it, I still remained in my seat because I paid for it.Indeed, it progressed to a real show and the same theme with kiddie shows shed – adventure and fun and funny. The jokes were actually still funny and quite original, the introduction of some characters were effective and sensible they were not some just-arts to add up to the entourage. Still, the characters were consistent with their beings.Surprisingly, there were some richly entertaining actions packed with visual stimulations to keep me stuck on my seat. Although it failed to entertain me intellectually, I enjoyed the most of it because it simply was fun.I was just annoyed with the kids at my back who were voicing their predictions about what was going to happen and their parents nagging that they should leave the cinema because they already watched the movie for the third time.",7,4,9,9 July 2009
V for Vendetta," Bloody Okay and Cool,,,
","This is the first England-government story I watched. I think of England as a cold place, like Russia contrast to America- bright, sunshiny and gay. Politics is always a controversial thing, I see this picture as Hitler of England. But the story isn't about them, it is about V and Evey. Its almost a love story if Catherine Hardwicke should have made this one it is dark, funny but not in hugly way- it is still dark.I only watched this movie because of IMDb, you people rated it 8.2 so I gave my time in watching one of the best movies of all time. The trailer before wasn't that much appealing, I thought it was one of the corny heroes and villains thing and a girl in between, with dark comedic appearance of V but it turned out I liked it too, just as much as most of IMDb people do.V represents the heroes of good journalism, heroes of revolution against a monopoly or colony, heroes that somehow desperately screamed for justice and fairness but it landed on deaf ears. He maybe the voice of the oppressed, the weak, the experimented, but he too was the hero of the weak, the oppressed and the tested.This is one of Hero movies, although it doesn't fall under the category of a fairy tale well I guess, all hero movies are not fairy tales because heroes will not be heroes unless they die, and before they die, they experience massive pain and titanic failures. They also die without knowing the real significance of what they did to humanity. In the end whether their loved ones experience the freedom they fought for or they would die too in agony and pain.V is a movie I liked because of good actors and good directing, good story lines and not with a crappy script. The special effects are good even if it wasn't made extravagantly or wasn't made too sophisticated it is almost not true I know its not true but movies should make their audiences feel the impact of the movie, like real or something.",10,3,12,6 April 2009
