The Blair Witch Project," Very disappointing movie. One of the worst I have ever seen.
","I had looked forward to attending a free preview of this movie, but unfortunately, was very disappointed. This movie is contrived, and on par with the types of ghosts stories children tell around a campfire. It was over acted. The ending was ridiculous. I have never been to a movie where nearly the entire audience ended up mocking the characters after the movie like they did at this showing. I would not recommend this movie at all.",Null,1,3,5 June 1999
