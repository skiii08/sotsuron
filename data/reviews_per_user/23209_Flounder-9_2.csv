Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just Excellent
","This movie was spectacular.  The special effects were amazing.  Many of the critics I have read and heard about say this movie lacks character development.  This what all the critics whine about when they can't find anything wrong with the movie.  The final light saber duel between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Maul is one of the best fight scenes ever captured on the big screen.  This movie was sensational and it did live up to the hype, and as you know, there was a lot of hype to live up to.  If you didn't like this movie, get a life.",10,0,0,21 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," Unbelievably excellent
","This was a spectacular movie.  I don't usually like movies of the horror genre, but my wife wanted to see it.  Since Bruce Willis was in it, I gave it a try.  It was scary without being over the edge.  It wasn't gory or one of those stupid 80's slasher movies.  This is one of the most intelligent movies made.  Haley Joel Osment is the greatest child actor I have ever seen.  He did not get fake and was very convincing.  I did not feel that he was reading from a script to me.  This movie would have been much less without him.  While I do like Bruce Willis' over the edge action movies, I also thought that he was excellent in this movie.  The conversation between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis was so real.  They were on an equal plane.The end of this movie was the greatest and most unexpected twist of all time.  I want to see this movie again now that I know what the end is because thinking back, I realize there were many hints dropped to what the end would be that made sense as I was driving home.An absolute must see.",10,0,0,17 August 1999
