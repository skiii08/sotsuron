Skyfall," A total waste of time
","Honestly, I haven't been a big fan of 007 in the recent years. In my opinion ever since Daniel Craig joined the franchise there hasn't been a single 007 movie to would come anywhere close to those made back in the day, which were entertaining, fun and enjoyable. And its not just because Craig's portraying of Bond is totally different from what the previous ones used to be (wit, handsome and full of irony and humor) but also because with every next movie there is less and less sense in the plot. The most recent edition beats them all from that aspect. We can clearly see that it cost millions of $ to make it, given all the FX in the film, but I just wish a fraction of that money had been used to pay a decent script writer. The movie has got good cast but its not enough to cover up the overall meaninglessness of it, which actually lasts over 2 hours of screen time. Gave it 2 stars for cast, otherwise its not even a 1.",2,4,9,17 March 2013
