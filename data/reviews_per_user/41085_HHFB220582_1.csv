Mission: Impossible III," Best movie in the series!!! Don't miss it for the WORLD!
","I just saw this movie at the movies, and damn it's awesome... This movie shows that Tom Cruise still got it, although he is 43 years old..( He does all his stunts by him self) If u liked the last two movies, u will love the 3rd. It's got a good plot like the first, and more intense action then the second.. Don't miss it for the world guys/girls. It's worth every penny.. Best blockbuster movie so far this year... The movie is fun, action packed, and a thrill ride of a lifetime... Look forward for this if u haven't seen it.. People that says this movie stinks, apparently doesn't have a good taste in action movies..Want some action and a good plot.... See MI:3 See ya at the movies!",10,1,3,5 May 2006
