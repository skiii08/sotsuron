Blade Runner 2049," Exceeded Expectations
","The story was a great way to tie this one in with the original, without casting someone to play Ford's part. As an actor, he is too hard to follow (see, Solo). Don't do yourself the disservice of seeing this before the original. stream it then watch this one right after. Wait; watch the original five times or so, then watch this one. This film found the balance of staying true to the scenematic and visual texture while introducing its own spin. Casting was amazing!Must see...cj",10,2,13,6 June 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Spike really punched us in the mouth this time
","I won't say much, the movie speaks for itself. Go see it and I think you'll agree. One thing, that was one of the best endings to a movie I have ever seen; right on time.",10,42,109,11 August 2018
