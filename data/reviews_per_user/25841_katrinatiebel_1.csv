United 93," A film I didn't think I could watch again
","I never thought I'd watch it again as great as it was, but so painful. I rewatched it tonight and forgot how well made it was and how well it paid respect to the heroes of flight 93. I don't have the words, but a phenomenal film in it's raw approach and simplicity that captures only a fraction of a tragedy.",9,0,0,10 June 2020
