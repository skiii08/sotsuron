The Incredible Hulk," An Action Packed, High Flying Comic Book Film
","The Incredible Hulk is a reboot of the Hulk films, because many people though that the first film was confusing and boring. Luckily, I am one of those people that thinks that this film is much better and better written than Ang Lee's film. It is action packed, more thought out, and is closer to the 1970s Hulk TV series than the first.Edward Norton is great as Bruce Banner, who turns into the Hulk when he is angry. We are also introduced to the Abomination, a classic Hulk villain played by Tim Roth. The fight scenes between the two are awesome and really display great computer generated effects and graphics.Overall, The Incredible Hulk is an entertaining super hero film and I am looking forward to watching it again in the near future.",9,3,4,24 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Beginning
","Now, you probably think that I am going to sit and hammer this film. Well, I'm not because believe it or not, this was the film that got me into Star Wars, and I enjoy it. It has that new car smell we have never come across before, and that new feeling and plot. Though this film is quite boring at times, it has it's share of interesting scenes, like the Podrace and the battle with Darth Maul at the very end.It also has it's share of community, most displayed in the dim-witted notorious Jar Jar Binks. I guess they needed a little comic relief after all the dark, erratic nature of the last films. It's also displayed in characters like Watto and Anakin Skywalker. I also think that the special effects have meaning to them, even though they were made in a computer.Overall, The Phantom Menace is satisfying, but still a little on the off-side. I guess you can call this the black-sheep of the series. Now it's time for my fish sticks, MMMMMMM!",7,9,13,22 August 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," It's a radio for speaking to God!
","This is the best action film of all time, in my opinion. It't got great action, great stunts, great dialogue, it's just a fun, action packed masterpiece.Harrison Ford, Han Solo from Star Wars is perfect for the role of Indiana Jones. Would you believe Tom Sellick was going to play him. This film is also known for it's iconic scenes, like the boulder roll, the opening of the Ark of the Covenant, and the brilliant car chase scene. One thing I find odd is that Alfred Molina is covered in spiders in the one part, and in the future, he will be playing a villain to Spider-Man, Docter Octopus.Overall, this movies classic, and deserves all the praise it gets. If you want an action-packed thriller that you will never get tired off, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the film for you.",10,1,2,23 August 2009
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Phone Home! And tell your friend how awesome this film is!
","ET The Extra Terrestrial is another one of my favorite Spielberg films. It is fun, entertaining, and whimsical for child and adults alike, who will compliment for the film's great special effects and story. This film is also known for it's use of animatronics, famous Amblin Entertainment logo scene, Reese's Pieces, and a whole sloot of others.One thing I must point out is it's references to Star Wars, such as Elliot's action figures, the kid dressed as Yoda, and not to mention the ET aliens were seen in The Phantom Menace. I also enjoy the movie's action scenes, like the bike chase, and the opening scene where ET i s dropped on Earth. We are also supported my minor things in between like ET drinking beer, the scene where ET almost dies, and a whole lot of other stuff I don't want to spoil.ET is a great film that I hold very dear to my heart. It's too bad the game wasn't this way! Now all of those games are within the dirt of the New Mexico landfill. But this movie isn't because it is a true classic that no one should have to miss.",10,0,2,23 August 2009
Star Trek," Sensational
","When you grow up a Star Wars fan, you probably think that no other sci-fi film would do as good. Luckily,we were all proved wrong when Star Trek hit theaters a couple of months ago.This film is not only an incredible reboot, but the beginning of a whole new story, a whole new setting, and the introduction to a lot of things we have not seen before in Star Trek.Chris Pine is great as Captain Kirk, you can really spot the William Shatner in him, and Zachary Quinto as Mr. Spock is my favorite of the cast. He is so much like Leonard Nimoy, you can barely tell them apart. We are also introduced to a new villain called Nero, a time traveling Romulan that comes from the future into the past to seek revenge on the United Federation of Planets.There are also new things that were not yet explored in Star Trek, like Scotty's past, the creation of black holes through red matter, the newly enhanced Enterprise, and Old Spock meeting Young Spock.Overall, Star Trek is an awesome film, and a new beginning that will surely bring a lot of action packed Star Trek adventures in the near future.",10,1,7,24 August 2009
Spider-Man 2," My Favorite Comic Book Film
","Spider-Man was an okay film, but it is not as good as Spider-Man 2. This film is obviously the best of the franchise, and gives us a lot of the high-quality action we have wanted from the very gecko. There are lots of fight scenes, lots of great acting, and great character development that drives the story further.In this film, Spider-Man is facing off the evil Doctor Octopus, and trying to balance out his time, so he can do things like his job at the Bugle and tend to Mary Jane. it's not easy, but it is funny and entertaining to watch. This film is awesome because it gives us a lot of the things that we have been asking for, such as great action scenes, great story, and in the end, this is a great comic book film, and is my favorite comic book of all time.",10,6,8,24 August 2009
Batman Returns," Burton's Only Sequel
","Though this movie is dark, bloody, and just plan weird at parts, it's still a fun, action packed thrilled ride that can not be missed, if you are a Batman fan.Michael Keaton returns as Batman, and Danny Devito and Michelle Pfeiffer enter the Batman films as the Penguin and Catwoman. The relationship between these characters is odd and whimsical, but they really nailed it with the character development. Would you believe this is a Christmas film, but it was released in mid-July? This film is great, and in some parts, surpasses the first film. It's mush darker and moodier, but still a great action film to watch. I still do not get why they had to cancel the Happy Meal promotion. I would have loved to get some of the toys from this movie. Good day!",8,0,0,23 August 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Explains Everything
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a great popcorn film that I overall enjoyed. It has a lot of action to last you a lifetime and explains why Wolverine is Wolverine and explains his backstory before he became part of the X-Men.You can also look forward to seeing a lot of your comic book favorites like Gambit, Blob, Cyclops,Deadpool, Maverick and lots of others. I don't want to spoil everything, but the movie contains a lot of claw slashing action, the battles of each World War, and an execution that turns out to be an utter failure.If you are in the mood for some great high flying action, this is the movie I recommend. It is a great comic book film that doesn't kill off the entire franchise and surely beats the somewhat dull reception of X-Men: The Last Stand.",8,2,6,24 August 2009
X-Men," Claw-Slashing Fun!
","X-Men is one of the most beloved comic-book series of all time, and the 2000 film directed by Bryan Singer really shortens the whole thing up, but still gives us a really good, kick ass film.The cast in this film are great. Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine, for he brings out the character so well, almost making him real. I also liked Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, I mean, Charles Xavier. The fight scenes in this film are also something to talk about. My favorite of the scenes was the end fight on the Statue of Liberty. Totally awesome.I also enjoyed the character development in this film. Be sure to check out how Wolverine became Wolverine, and see Magneto being taken away during WWII. In the end, X-Men is a very exemplary film, and is one of the best comic-book films of all time. It is also the reason why we see good super-hero films today. Do you think that super-hero films would be so popular these days if this film was not in existence?",10,2,4,29 September 2009
Spider-Man 3," Venom at last!
","Spider-Man 3 is the worst Spider-Man film as of right now, but it's not all entirely too bad. I thought it was better than other super-hero films like Hulk, Daredevil, and that vile Batman and Robin, but the pace of the film and the many plots makes it out to be the black sheep of the series.Personally, I enjoyed the special effects,particularly the scene where Flint Marko becomes the Sandman, and the end battle between Spider-Man, New Goblin, Sandman and Venom was the highlight of the film. Also, Spider-Man gets coded in a black alien, causing him to lash out in evil. I wish they would have come up with the proper design for the black costume, instead of making it his classic costume in black.Venom makes his villainous debut in this film, and despite him having very little screen time, he was pretty cool. Topher Grace did a great job portraying the character of Eddie Brock. I also enjoyed James Franco as Harry Osbourne, or the New Goblin. Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman was also okay, but I was one of them people that thought that he shouldn't have been in the film. Also, how does he cry? In the end, Spider-Man is an awesome movie, but I wasn't as good as the first 2, and Spider-Man didn't seem to have all the spotlight anymore, for most of it went to the villains. But I can't wait to see what Spider-Man 4 will give us, keep on bringing the sequels Raimi!",8,2,3,30 September 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Nice Way To End The Originals
","Return of the Jedi is great. It has that great exuberant feeling to it that has you at the edge of your seat in suspense. And you have good reason to, because this is the final chapter in one of the greats Sci-Fi series of all time. All the Star Wars films have meaning to them. Star Wars starts the story, The Empire Strikes Back progresses the story further, and Return of the Jedi raps it up in this fine peace of cinema.We also are introduced to the slimy Jabba the Hutt, the adorable Ewoks, and the Emperor in flesh in blood. We also see the deaths of Yoda and Darth Vader, two of the key characters in the entire Star Wars saga. Truly sad, but it perfectly fits the meaning of the film. Without going into anymore detail, Return of the Jedi (Episode VI: Return of the Jedi) is the summer-upper film, rapping up the events of the Originals in a climatic and somewhat bitter-sweet manner.",10,0,1,22 August 2009
Alien," Aliens. Space Travel. Explosions. Aliens ripping out of guy's bellies, what more can you ask in a sci-fi film?
","Alien is another one of them sci-fi thriller that I love. It has great action, great story, and great special effects that really complement the film. Tom Skerrit, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm, John Hurt, and the many others are perfect in their roles. John Hurt must have Hurt, when that alien came ripping out of his stomach. What a major owwwwwy! The film also has them great action scenes, like the fight between Ash, the recurring battles with the Alien, and the exploration of the planet. Everyone who sees this film will walk out pleased and satisfied, because this film is excellent, and remains one of the best science fiction films to this day.If you want a great sc-fi thriller to watch over and over again, I say check out Alien, because it is a sci-fi film that is like no other. Pick it up and enjoy! Oh, and bring a barf bag! BLAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWW!",10,0,1,23 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Another one of them controversial films
","Star Wars: Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. Attack of the critics! I don't know why people are on this film like a pack of hungry wolves. It's better than the Phantom Menace, and has a lot of the Star Wars we have been waiting for. In my opinion, it's a great sequel to the Phantom Menace, and sets more of the groundwork for the rest of the films.The highlight of the film was to see Yoda finally fight with a lightsaber, and for Christopher Lee to play the villain. It's odd to think that all Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and David Prowse were all in Star Wars, and also in a movie about Frankenstein released in the70s. We also see Anakin giving into his hatred and evolve from a simple boy to an infuriated tyrant.Overall, I enjoy this film and really wish people would come to understand that it's decent. I think it's a great edition to the Star Wars films, and no Star Wars collection would be complete without it.",8,3,5,22 August 2009
Watchmen," Fun Super Hero Film
","I am not a big fan of Watchmen, I guess you can say that I am caught in the realm of Spider-Man, Batman, Superman and a whole lot of others. But I thought this movie was pretty good. It has a lot of action, great acting and special effects, and was very entertaining.The characters a legendary, especially Rorschach, who is my favorite character. I also enjoyed the great fight scenes and the exotic text and comic book like appeal. It's incredible! Overall, Watchmen is a good film that deserves a lot of credit. Highly recommend a sequel and perhaps a new line of comics, because this movie really was a hell of a lot of fun!",8,0,4,24 August 2009
"I, Robot"," Decent Film
","I,Robot is an okay movie for me. It has a lot of great action scenes, great story, but it somewhat felt flat for me. I enjoyed it, nevertheless, but didn't live up to the high hopes some of us had, and it makes it out to be quite a silly film.Will Smith, James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and the many others are great actors, and the highlight of the film, and the animation on the robots are fantastic. I love the expressions on their faces, making them out to be more like humans than robots. Some of the action and fighting is also something to point out. The fight against the robots was excellent, another highlight of the film.Overall, I,Robot was an okay film, but seem somewhat flat and overdone in some parts. I enjoyed it though, and think it is a fun action film that is great for sci-fi lovers.",7,0,2,27 August 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the best movies of the decade
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day surpasses The Terminator on every level. It has cool action scenes, great acting, and some of the best special effects I have ever seen in a film. The T-1000 is one of the best characters I have ever seen, because the special effects on the characters are so incredible, it makes it seem like it was done in real life, not in a computer.Arnold is great, and better than he was in Terminator. I also enjoyed the actor who played John Conner, Edward Furlong. Little did we know that Christian Bale would be playing him nearly 17 years later. I also like Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner, and Robert Patrick as the T-1000.Overall,Judgment Day is one of the best sci-fi thriller I have ever seen, and would go on to become one of the best movie sequels of all time.",10,8,11,27 August 2009
Spider-Man," Web-Slinging Classic
","Spider-Man is at last brought to the big screen after several years of banishment. And I have got to say, that this is one of the best super-hero films I have ever seen. Everything that made the comic-books famous is in this film, and the character development is just excellent. It's too bad Ang Lee's Hulk wasn't like this.Spider-Man is pretty awesome, the stunts and effects done on the character make him look as if he is real, and was not made on a computer. The Green Goblin is also pretty cool, but his costume was a little off. I thought he should had has his trademark ghoul like costume instead of some strange green suit of armor.The movie also has great action scenes, great acting, and in the end, this film is incredible as the comic books are. Spider-Man 2 and 3 are also awesome, but it will always be the first that gives us that Spider-Man pep we need.",10,0,1,25 September 2009
District 9," A Great Film To Wrap Up The Summer
","I saw District 9 the Friday before summer ended, and I will started out by saying.....WOW! I mean seriously WOW! This movie is incredible, and unlike anything I have ever seen in my life. The special effects were awesome, the action was really neat, and overall it was a fun, action-packed sci-fi thriller that all lovers of the genre should see.The aliens in this film are iconic, kinda like strange beetle ant like things that talk like Jabba the Hutt's cousin's brother's uncle. The acting by such actors like Jason Cope was fantastic, and the way they interact with the alien invaders was far beyond alien interaction.I'm gonna wrap up this film up saying that it was spectacular. I have never seen a science fiction film like this one. Like I said earlier, it's a must see for sci-fi lovers anywhere.",10,5,10,28 August 2009
Batman Begins," The Rebat
","After the horrible reception of Batman and Robin, another Batman film would appear to be a waste of time. There was a fifth movie in the works called Batman Triumphant, but due to the terrible reaction to Batman and Robin, the idea was trashed. So 8 years went by, and people said, let's reboot the Batman franchise, and the result is the excellent Batman Begins.This film is incredible for many reasons. It is the only Batman film by far to have the Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul as the villains, the the only one to have Batman in his scratchy, throat cancer voice. It also features Bruce Wayne's squeeze from the comics, Rachel Dawes, and the curious inventor, Lucius Fox, played by Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors.This film is also jam packed with great special effects, stunts, great chases with the Batmobile, I mean the Tumbler, and great dialogue.Overall, it is up their with the original Batman and Batman Returns, and highly surpasses the Schumacher films. It's a fun,exciting super hero film that is good to the last drop, but it is not nearly as good as it's sequel that would come in the following years.",9,0,0,24 August 2009
The Dark Knight," Holy Beer Bottles, Batman! What a masterpiece this is!
","The Dark Knight is the best super hero film of 2008. Iron Man was good, The Incredible Hulk was pretty good, but this film just surpasses both of them. This film has gone where no super hero film has gone before. It is surely Oscar worthy and deserves a lot of recognition for it's high quality effects and stunts.The cast is great. Christian Bale was born to play Batman, and Heath Ledger...where do I even start. He is excellent as the Joker, really freaky and scary and destructive, just as I pictured him in the Nolan Batman film series. Aaron Eckhart was also good as Two-Face, beats Tommy Lee Jones by a lightyear. I also enjoyed Gary Oldman as James Gordan, he is breathtakingly awesome! This film also brings fate to some of the characters, has you at the edge of your seat at times, and is overall a suspenseful and action-packed film that is worthy of lots of awards. Like the joker would say, It's all part of the plan!",10,1,9,24 August 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the best sci-fi thrillers of all time. A masterpiece
","I love science fiction, it's my favorite movie genre. But one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time is a film that everyone has seen at least one in their life, and have come to enjoy. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a true classic, and has met all standards. Stanley Kubrick did a good job with the film, and in the end, we got a fantastic sci-fi thriller to add to the bunch.A lot of the scenes are iconic, as well as the music. The scoring by Gene D.Phillips is amazing, and some of the best scoring I have ever heard. The special effects are so awesome, you'd think that they existed in real life, instead of models.Overall, all I can say is that 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that all sci-fi lovers should see because it is a true masterpiece. It really did deserve those Oscars it received, because it is truly magnificent.",10,1,3,23 August 2009
Avatar," Perhaps the best film of the decade.
","I love this movie. It is fun and suspenseful at the same time. But it's James Cameron, so what can you expect. If you love science fiction and action, you are going to love this film, because it delivers a lot of action that will last you a lifetime.The acting is great. I love the relationships between the characters, and it's fun to see all the action in 3-D. Some of the stuff didn't even look like it was made in a computer. The Na'vi are also some of the most convincing creatures ever on film. They are sort of a cross between smurfs, cats, and Native Americans.Overall, Avatar is just....awesome! If you loved Jurassic Park, you will love this! If you loved Terminator, you will love this! If you loved Batman and Robin, you can spit that movie out like a bad taste in your mouth. This film is fun and exciting!",10,3,6,8 January 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My Favorite of the Prequels
","At last! A movie that everyone can agree on. After years and years of bickering about Episodes 1 and 2, BOOM! Star Wars: Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. This movie is so kick-ass, it makes you forget about how much the others stunk, not to mention the complaining about the computer graphics.This is the movie where we find out just how Anakin Skywalker becomes the villain we all know and love from the originals, Darth Vader. There are also lots of lightsaber duels, groundbreaking effects, and some hilarious gags, like the one scene where R2-D2 crashes into a wall.We also find out how the Emperor's face got all mangled up and how Luke and Leia ended up separated. Overall, Revenge of the Sith is pretty damn cool. Great story, great action, it's just a great awesome flick. That's why it's my favorite of the prequels.",9,4,7,23 August 2009
Iron Man," Iron Masterpiece
","Iron Man is a excellent movie. I was blown away. I though the movie was going to blow, but now, I have come to realize that this is one of the best super hero movies I have ever seen. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect for Tony Stark, and Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes adds more beans to the meat. We also get cool fight scenes, like the fight between Iron Man and the Iron Monger, and lots of other high flying special effects.In the end, Iron Man is a fun comic book film that stays true to the comic books, and leaves fans walking out of the theater overjoyed. I can't wait for the sequel and surely hope that they can keep the Iron Man franchise fresh, and make a series that is not only entertaining, but funny and action packed at the same time.",10,0,1,24 August 2009
Blade Runner," Scott's Finest
","Blade Runner is an extraordinary science fiction film that not only packs in good action and special effects, but a good plot and storyline. Harrison Ford, who by this time was best known for Han Solo and Indiana Jones, is now a police officer named Rick Deckard, also known as the Blade Runner. We are also introduced to characters like Holden, Leon, Roy Batty, and Sean Young as Rachael.Based upon the novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' by Phillip K. Dick, this film is jam packed with hours of high quality effects and many glorious stunts that will make you ask yourself. How did they do that? Blade Runner is an excellent film, and if you are bored on a Saturday night, I say watch this film, it is very entertaining and a lot of fun.",10,4,9,24 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Timeless Classic
","Star Wars is one of the greatest films of all time, and for many reasons. The special effects used in this film are excellent, the the plot and story development is well constructed. The casting is great, Mark Hamill is perfect for the role of Luke Skywalker, and Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan is truly fantastic. And Darth Vader is perhaps one of the greatest symbols of evil of all time. He surely knows how to choke a person.Overall, Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) is a perfect film, and really deserved those seven Oscars it received in 1978. May the force be with you, always!",10,0,0,22 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Perfect Sequel
","Most of the time, sequels are a bit of a disappointment, because of lame story and poor special effects. The Empire Strikes Back on the other hand is one of the best sequels I've ever seen in my life. Everything in this film is marvelous. The story is great, and the character development is far more dark and gruesome than in the first film. The new characters, such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian really add something to the Star Wars saga.And what would an Empire Strikes Back review be without mentioning one of the most famous lines of all time: No, I am your father.Truly a shocker, perhaps one of the greatest move climaxes of all time. In conclusion, The Empire Strikes Back (Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back) is outstanding, and meets all the standards that movie sequels should. I never get tired of watching it.",10,3,5,22 August 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," It belongs in a museum!
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade brings back a lot of the things we seen in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Nazis, that thin wording in the beginning, Sallah. It's a great film to watch, an a great way to end an era, up until the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull arrived.In this film, Indy goes looking for a lot of things. The Cross of Coronado, a piece to a tablet, and the Holy Grail. Along the way, Indy is accompanied by his father, Henry Jones Sr., which he has to go looking for in the beginning half of the film. Along they way we get fun motorcycle chases, a plane ride, RATS, and a man rotting like a prune.Indy also discovers the Holy Grail within himself, and finally brings balance to the relationship between him and his father. In the end, Indy learns that family and responsibility is more important than any Holy Grail in the world. The Last Crusade is an inspirational classic, and any Indiana Jones film is not complete without it. All I can say is if you watched this film, You chose wisely!",10,4,7,23 August 2009
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Classic
","I love this film, not only because it involves dinosaurs and a bunch of actors who seem to do a good job of acting like the fraidy-cat inhabitants who must escape Jurassic Park, no. I love it because it has a charm that no other film has. It has that classic 90s appeal to it, so when people say Jurassic Park, people flash back to their youth of seeing in in the theater in 1993.George Lucas and the folks over in ILM did a fantastic job on the dinosaurs in the film. They are so realistic, and the added stunts make them out to be the most awesome CGI animals ever made. I also enjoyed the stunts and effects that the people use in the film, and it is some of the best that I have seen in years.Overall, Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, and a true part of my childhood. The cereal was great too, even though it was a cheap rip-off of Lucky Charms.",10,2,4,27 August 2009
