10 Cloverfield Lane," It started out superb; then slowly progressed to an unrealistic viewing.
","In the beginning, it caught my attention. I would say from the moment the exposition occurred, it would be a 10/10 star film. Amazing! Then 3/4 in the way in, it slowly began to go downhill. It featured aliens, and other unrealisitic animals. If your looking for a horror, keep looking. If your looking for a scientific film, then you would enjoy this.
Depends.
It varied throughout the duration.

A Star Is Born," Powerful message; good overall
","I personally preferred the film. It was unexpectedly innapropiate; and did not convey a happy/perfect star story. It displayed a message everyone needs to know about drugs; and it was pretty good. It is definitley a film I would view twice.
8/10",8,1,3,2 December 2018

Green Book," Powerful message; significantly symbolic
","This film has a wonderful message. Regarding racism, and the way some individuals in a modern society treat others by simply being colored. I believe that this film did an excellent way of portraying such a miserable, and painful topic. In order to comprehend this film it is crucial to ANALYZE. There was not one weak scene for me. It had a little bit of everything. I laughed.. I Cried. I enjoyed.Amazing! =10/10 stars! :-)",10,27,51,13 January 2019
