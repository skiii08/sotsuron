The Blair Witch Project," Good, creepy scare
","This movie snuck up on me.  I left the theater thinking it was a  decent flick - not as scary as I hoped.  Then, a few hours later, the movie caught up to me and I saw it's genius.  It's not what you see, but what you don't see.  The subtlety of the terror almost slipped by me.  I'm typing this review at 2:30 AM, I work nights, jumping at every sound from the office and thinking of kids standing in a corner.",Null,1,1,2 September 1999
