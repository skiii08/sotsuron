Walk the Line," a truly great movie
","I was amazed by the performances because the main characters were brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. The whole movie took me back to a place of wonderful memories. To everyone involved in this movie, thank you for an awesomely wonderful film. I think Johnny and June would have been very touched and pleased . God Bless you all. I happen to think there could have been no better choices to play the roles in this movie, and there was much that I personally remembered having read about Johnny Cash, though I didn't remember anything about June Carter until after the story broke about their relationship. I think an excellent job was done on this film over all and I wish Joaquin Phoenix could have gotten more recognition for the great job he did portraying Johnny Cash",10,0,0,8 October 2006
