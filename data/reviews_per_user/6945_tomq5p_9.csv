Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," An offensive letdown
","This film had a lot of potential, but Sacha Baron Cohen rarely capitalized on it. He basically just resorted to making comments that reflected how 'backward' his fictional Kazakhstan is. People have the right to be offended. However, I am by no means advocating the censorship of this movie. In fact, the most outrageous scenes in the film (which must have raised the eyebrows of the censors at the MPAA) are also the funniest. There is an ongoing debate on whether it is appropriate for Sacha Baron Cohen to create a character who is supposedly from a real country, Kazakhstan, and then proceed to insult the country for an hour and a half by acting like a racist, misogynistic idiot (among many other things). Some argue that Baron Cohen's motivations - to expose usually carefully hidden American ignorance, racism and prejudice - justify the film's content. I do not buy into this for one primary reason: the majority of the people will laugh for all the 'wrong' reasons and few of the 'right' ones. In the theater, many scenes that elicited laughs clearly did so by simply portraying highly racist and sexist beliefs, not by exposing the ignorance that those beliefs are predicated upon. It is sad to say, but the majority of Americans have been brainwashed for so long that they are not ready to see this movie and definitely not equipped to understand the complicated, highly critical satire that it is meant to be. Many may argue that a movie should be judged on its 'real' or intended message, not what people take from it, and that makes perfect sense. But the question is whether Baron Cohen motivations are purely honorable. Let's remember how much money is at stake here. The movie has already made over 20 million dollars at the U.S. box office. It seems much too convenient to make a movie that can be interpreted in at least two ways and make the majority of the money off of people who are laughing AT Borat and the ultra-racist stereotype he represents, not the critical lens of American society and culture that some will see him as. Many, possibly even the majority, of the jokes in the film are based on Borat's ignorance, not on the ignorance of the people he interacts with. The notable exception is a stand-out scene at a rodeo in which Borat whips the crowd into a small frenzy about the 'war of terror' and killing all the Iraqis. I am afraid the frat boys that Borat encounters during his travels represent the response that mainstream American will have to this film - albeit exaggerated. In future films, Baron Cohen should be more critical and rely on exposing ignorance, not participating in it. That's not to say that an intelligent, critical person won't laugh at the film. Everyone will, especially during the soon-to-be infamous hotel scene. However, I left the theater thinking more about Baron Cohen's motivations and the average American's reaction than how Borat pulled the wool over so many people's eyes to create this biting satire. 4 out of 10",4,8,16,5 November 2006
Shaun of the Dead," A graphic, funny zombie classic
","I have to hand it to creators of this film; they manage to combine humor, zombies, and a story of love and redemption in a way that's very palatable and fun to watch. This film is not for the faint-of-heart, because, although it's primarily a comedy, there is a boatload of gore, guts, and carnage. It's stylized yet graphic, funny yet not necessarily fake-looking. The dialogue is quick and usually pretty funny, although I didn't find the use of the word 'gay' particularly funny or necessary. The plot revolves around a guy who works a dead-end job, just got dumped by his girlfriend, and lives with his lazy deadbeat friend. Suddenly, the recently deceased return from the dead and start preying on the living and he has a chance to redeem himself. So, he arms himself with a cricket bat, his friend gets a shovel and they get down to business. There are zombies galore and a lot of humor that will appeal most to the younger (high school and college) crowd. This film is a great homage to George A. Romero's zombie films (among others). In fact, after seeing the film, Romero invited Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg to play zombies in his 'Land of the Dead.' If you are a fan of the zombie genre, you are almost guaranteed to like this film; if not, there is still a solid chance that you will be entertained, but you'll miss out on more homages than Quentin Tarantino can shake a stick at.",8,0,1,23 July 2006
Cloverfield," Decent but nothing to write home about
","I had extremely high expectations for this movie (as I'm sure many other fans did). They were not met, but that doesn't mean that the movie was a complete flop. I jumped in my seat many times and I appreciated the unique way the movie was filmed. The movie succeeded at creating a realistic feel. The acting was better than the average movie and the CGI wasn't too bad either. Without spoiling anything, the monster looks kind of weird. Some people will like it, others will not. I am on the fence. It was unlike anything I've seen before, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. One thing I am sure of is the fact that I wish I saw more of it (as well as the destruction that it left behind). I think, in this case, a bigger budget would have yielded a more satisfying result. I am also not too sure that the hand-held camera approach added a whole lot. The way the wide angle shots were set up was pretty clever though. One thing that really bothered me was the product placement. There is one shot in particular when the camera hovers over some candy for no reason whatsoever. There were embedded ads for Nokia, Dunkin' Donuts, Juicy Fruit, Mountain Dew, and others. Call me old-school, but, like David Lynch, I don't think that product placement has any place in true cinema. I expected better from Cloverfield. Overall, I think this movie was on par with Godzilla. Godzilla had better CGI and way cooler shots of the monster but a weak plot and pretty bad acting. It just depends what you value. Since I am a sucker for cool action sequences and good special effects, I would probably prefer watching Godzilla. At least I wouldn't have a headache when it was over. Speaking of the ending, I liked it. I have heard a lot of complaints, but I think it was appropriate and well done.7 out of 10",7,12,25,18 January 2008
28 Weeks Later," As good as the original, if not better
","Although this film isn't too similar to '28 Days Later...,' it is a quality piece of movie-making. The editing is insanely fast, the gore is in-your-face, and the action is phenomenal, albeit over-the-top. If you are a fan of zombie flicks or relentless action, check this out now. Be prepared for plenty of gross out moments and blood letting. Also, if you pay close attention and get a little creative, you can find a political subtext to the film, much like the first installment.Yes, the acting is mediocre. Yes, there are plenty of scenes that are illogical or just downright impossible, but that doesn't really matter when zombies are attacking from all directions and people are being devoured and torn limb from limb. This is a must-see for fans of the genre. The lack of character development is a valid criticism, but, frankly, any more of that would have bored me. I appreciated the 'cutting to the chase,' over and over again...One complaint I had was a couple shoddy CGI shots that were blatantly unrealistic. Other than that, I was thoroughly entertained. Hey, I even thought a little.7 out of 10",7,5,13,15 May 2007
Saw III," Nowhere near as good as the first two
","'Saw III' doesn't possess many of the qualities that made the first two movies so good. There are still crazy death-traps and excessively gory scenes, but that's about it. The twists are weak and predictable at that. The acting is mediocre. The plot is actually somewhat boring. There aren't any genuinely scary scenes, just graphic images that make you cringe. This movie seemed dumbed down. Everything was over-explained. The connections to the previous two films are weak and poorly done. I loved the first two movies, but this one is a significant departure. There were also several CGI shots that weren't convincing at all. I do not recommend this film for Saw fans. There is violence and gore and not a whole lot more. 4 out of 10",4,4,10,27 October 2006
The Illusionist," Good acting and cinematography cannot save a weak plot and script
","I really wanted to like this film but I simply couldn't. I predicted the ending as soon as it was possible to do so. Eisenheim (the Illusionist) didn't fool me, and he probably won't fool the moderately shrewd moviegoer either. The film didn't tie up a variety of loose ends and the plot was all over the place. The script was average at best. In fact, some of the dialogue struck me as not being accurate to the period being portrayed in the movie. All of the other aspects, however, of the period portrayal were excellent. The cinematography was impressive and contributed to the feel of the movie, which did a great job of placing the viewer in moment. Unfortunately, the plot was too weak to hold the movie together and there are many questions left unanswered. Some might argue that the film is supposed to leave the viewer asking questions. I, however, thought that is was more a result of sloppy film-making and a plot with several gaping holes. The opening scene didn't even match itself when it was shown again toward the end of the film. Everything was there except a solid plot or mystery. I have a feeling that 'The Prestige' will do a much better job with virtually the same concept. 5 out of 10",5,3,6,25 September 2006
The Descent," Exemplary horror
","If you appreciated Neil Marshall's 'Dog Soldiers,' this movie is for you. It is intense, suspenseful, and provides a lot of jump-scares and gore. Horror fans will not be disappointed. The storyline is straightforward: A group of women go spelunking and encounter flesh-craving cave dwellers. Insanity ensues. What makes this movie good is the fact that the characters are believable and developed enough so that we care about them, but not so developed that we get a drama instead of a horror flick. Also, the cave setting they find themselves in provides plenty of great opportunities for claustrophobia-inducing cinematography and minimalist film-making. This is a back-to-the-basics horror film, but the effects are realistic. There is a cave, a group of women, monsters, and the darker side of human nature - a combination that scares, excites, and doesn't let us down. This is another excellent horror film in the tradition of other recent successes in the genre, such as 'The Hills Have Eyes' and 'Wolf Creek.' 10 out of 10",10,3,7,5 August 2006
The Departed," Just short of a classic
","Martin Scorsese has created another great film that will join 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' (two of his earlier films) in the American mobster canon. However, this film isn't quite as good as Scorsese's earlier contributions. In fact, it doesn't really improve on 'Infernal Affairs,' the film it is based on - it merely Americanizes the story. The script is excellent for the most part. The dialogue is funny, quirky and effective. The actors do a great job (although the accents falter occasionally). Jack Nicholson is hilarious and believably crazy, although, admittedly, he is somewhat typecast as the character he plays in this film and seems to rely on standard grimaces and deranged smiles. Mark Wahlberg's character is strangely lovable, even though he plays a cop with very few redeeming qualities. Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio convince us that they are, respectively, moles in the police force and an organized crime racket. Alec Baldwin's supporting role is also very entertaining. One thing that bothered me was the subtle and not-so-subtle product placement, which, in my opinion, took away from the film (Halls and Dell are two prominent examples). While many argue that we should just accept product placement as a fact of life, I believe that directors have the choice to sell out or not and should resist the urge to make more money while compromising the visual and ethical integrity of their films. If you have not seen the original film (Infernal Affairs), you'll probably love this movie. If you have, you'll still like it. If you enjoy repartee coupled with violence (something only mobster movies seem to be able to satisfactorily provide), you'll be in for a treat. And, you might have a taste for some Halls mints when you leave the theater...7 out of 10",7,0,0,5 November 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Not enough laughs
","This could be deemed a 'preview movie.' The preview seen on television was funny and engaging; the movie isn't. In fact, some of the jokes seen in the preview don't even appear in the actual film. The film is basically a re-hash of 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (with a NASCAR spin). Notice the similarity of the two films' titles: both have a title and a sub-title; both include the main character's name; both main characters have the initials R.B.; one is a 'legend,' the other a 'ballad.' If 'Anchorman' made you laugh, 'Talladega Nights' probably will too. If you thought 'Anchorman' was inane and light on laughs, avoid 'Talladega Nights.' Both movies have some genuinely funny moments and punchlines, but not enough to sustain them. The formula for 'Talladega Nights' is the exact same one used for 'Anchorman': the actors ad-lib many of their lines and the film ends up being made in the editing room instead of emerging from the script. In theory, there is nothing wrong with this formula, but the jokes are simply not funny or frequent enough to keep the momentum up. The movie is basically a Will Ferrell Saturday Night Live sketch idea that is stretched out, somewhat painfully, over 100 minutes. The humor is funny at times, stupid and ignorant at others. 'Gay' jokes abound and the word 'retarded' pops up a couple times. Will Ferrell can be an excellent comedian; if he was held to a higher standard, maybe he'd produce some higher-brow humor instead of churning out mindless movies that are guaranteed to perform at the box office. One interesting aspect of the film is the way it completely embraces American NASCAR culture, right down to the barrage of product placement, homophobia, and overall ignorance. I left the theater somewhat unsure if the creators of the film were trying to make a statement (Will Ferrell definitely used some of his George W. impression for Ricky Bobby), or just banking in on a hugely popular American 'sport' and culture. As mush as I'd like to think I am one of the few who are 'in' on an elaborate joke, I doubt it. Part of the answer lies in whether or not all the brands that appear in the film (no doubt hundreds) were compensated. I fear that they were. 3 out of 10",3,7,16,5 August 2006
