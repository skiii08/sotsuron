Requiem for a Dream," The American Sid and Nancy
","This is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen -- just as much as Sid and Nancy was. I felt I needed a bath and bottles of Lysol to spray around my home after watching 'Sid & Nancy' and also after watching this movie. It is disturbing, and graphic, and thought provoking, and quite sad. If anyone feels the characters deserve what is coming to them ... watch a middle-aged single mother (like your mom & mine) do almost anything to attract LOVE. Forget for a second the young and beautiful Wayons' boy, and Leto, and Connelly ... AREN'T WE ALL DISGUSTED by them!This isn't a movie for the faint at heart, nor for the righteous. Watch this with your heart open, and let yourself be broken. That is what is intended, that is what it is meant to say.LOVE THEM, HATE THEM ... THEY ARE.",10,2,4,31 March 2007
