Moneyball," I enjoyed, but went to the 20-win game.
","OK, I enjoyed this movie, but that may be because I was actually a fan of that team, and remember those players. Obviously there are the events portrayed that didn't happen exactly like it was portrayed in the movie (search Google to find them all- it is a lot). It is interesting because it is a sports movie without a climatic moment (the streak is actually down played in the movie- Scott Hatteberg hitting that home run remains the greatest sports moment I've witnessed personally). Brad Pitt is on the screen nearly the entire movie (much like Cast Away with Tom Hanks). Fortunately, he is enjoyable, and his witty lines are classic. Enough has been said how the movie doesn't really mention Miguel Tejada (MVP), or Barry Zito (Cy Young), while focusing on Scott Hatteberg, Chad Bradford, and Ricardo Rincon.However, the movie doesn't actually overplay their role in the team. It is mainly about using statistics to get value from players. The A's got a lot of value from Scott Hatteberg It also created the perception that the A's started using this analysis in 2002, and Billy Beane was at risk of losing his job by the fans. In fact the A's had been using this strategy for a few years prior, and by 2002 Billy Beane was considered a genius (his status is currently debated). There wasn't a lot of criticism of Billy Beane on sports radio, mainly because there wasn't a lot of discussion about the A's on sports radio. Oakland fans would never complain about the A's on sports radio, instead they tried to prove that the A's were better than the Giants. That being said, it is enjoyable movie, but not not great. The climatic point of the movie was underscored- when I watched I though of the moment in Miracle. This time, you get the sense that winning 20 in a row meant almost nothing to Billy Beane, and there is a lot of dead space in the movie. However, as baseball movie about math, and a math movie about baseball, it is is not all that bad.",Null,0,0,25 September 2011
Bohemian Rhapsody," I enjoyed it. I wanted music and fun, and it was good music and a good story
","There are probably better bios, but quite frankly I went to see the music with a story. It's probably as close as I'll ever feel to being in a Queen audience. It was never meant to be this great narrative of Queen and Freddie Mercury. It told part of the story, and in the end- it was just fun.",9,3,4,10 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Well acted, but I prefer a movie with a plot
","Nothing happens in this movie until the very, and what does happen is extremely violent and gruesome.
The movie is credits for creating a great visual of Hollywood in 1969. However, Rick flew from Europe on 747, and the 747 didn't enter service until 1970, and the Tate murders occurred in 1969. It might seem minor, but since the visuals of the time period, it's an error.So much of the plot was contrived and unnecessary. It takes about 2 hours to get him to Europe to resurrect his career, and then a voice over comes on and movie rushes through 6 months where Rick does 4 movies, gets married, and for some reason decides to move back to Hollywood with his new Italian wife while firing his best friend.",2,4,6,9 February 2020
The Greatest Showman," This movie will be a classic
",As a movie- it has flaws. But the music is unbelievable. There are so many great songs in this movie,9,1,1,16 February 2020
