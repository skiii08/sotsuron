The Hangover," Can they show that?
","My goodness...this movie is hilarious. This is my 3rd film in the slew of summer films that I am bound to see, and it delivered. It has exactly the right proportion of sophomoric, violent, vulgar and charming comedy.I'm sure none of these actors are newcomers but I had never seen any of them in a blockbuster film but they all delivered. After watching this film, you'll definitely want to start planning your next trip to Vegas. I would recommend this film for a guys night out, a girls night out or just a good old date film (If you're not too squeamish). Stay to watch the credits...you'll definitely say to yourself. 'Can they show that in a rated R film?'",9,4,6,16 June 2009
The Battle of Algiers," So Real
","The portrayal of the battle for Algeria by the colonizing French and the native Algerians is almost as real as it can get in the movie 'The Battle of Algiers'. At times it is so realistic, it seems like you're watching a documentary. The scene that depicts this best is a shot of a raid of an Algerian community by the French military. During all of the commotion you see a naked baby boy crying outside its doorÂ…I wanted to reach through the screen and pick him up.I feel the movie tells an age long story of how a people can never be truly taken over. There will always be a fight for culture and freedom. Although this movie was about two sides of a fight, the movie never took sides. You get to see why both parties where fighting. In most battle films you pick a side in the beginning and stick with it throughout the film. This film lets you get an understanding of the Algerians and the colonizing French.",9,0,1,15 June 2009
