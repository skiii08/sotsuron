50 First Dates," This must have been a blast to film!!
","Adam Sandler stars as Henry Roth, a veterinarian who is into one-night-stands with beautiful tourists on the island of Hawaii. He constantly makes up lies to get out gracefully. His womanizing ways come to a quick end when he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore). There is only one problem, Lucy has no short-term memory, and Henry finds himself having to introduce himself to Lucy each and every day, with varying results.Sandler is his usual self here, (the goofy, likable type). Drew Barrymore looks awesome, and does a great job as Lucy. She has to deal with the discovery that for the last year, she has been doing exactly the same thing each and every day, due to the car accident. Sean Astin, with a hilarious role as Lucy's steroid-popping brother, and Blake Clarke as her father do an excellent job of keeping the unfortunate truth from her. Rob Schneider is fantastic as Ula, a coworker of Henry's and a complete stoner.I couldn't help think of Cheech Marin watching Schneider's performance.Overall a pretty good film. The Hawaiian location is a beautiful, and Sandler brings his usual cast of buddies along for bit parts.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,0,0,7 March 2005
The Godfather," Set the precedent...
","It's been a few years since I have seen this film, but it is definitely one of the all-time classics. I would give it a '10' but I find the length drags it down a little. Other than that deserving of belonging in the Top 250 films. However, I would not give it #1. I would have to reserver that honor for Sergio Leone's 'The Good The Bad and The Ugly'. 'The Godfather' did give us some awesome performances, one of the only Brando roles I truly enjoyed. As well my 2nd favorite Coppola film (1st being 'The Conversation').I think it's worth repeat viewing, and a definite keeper in a movie lover's collection. Bottom line a solid '8', with a desire to see it again soon.",8,0,2,9 September 2004
