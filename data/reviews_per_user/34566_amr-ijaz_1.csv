The Equalizer," Great action packed ride!
","Brilliant adrenaline filled movie, played perfectly by Denzel with a sublime finesse to his killings. All the action scenes were crafted perfectly whilst stopping it from becoming an out and out gore fest. There were some other cameos from Chloe moretz however Denzel played his role with a sense of class and dictated authority on the screen, a truly magnificent performance from a stalwart of Hollywood . The only downside was that some of the action scenes were not dealt with thoroughly and some were skipped over. Although the ending did drag on it still remained a great movie and good viewing for a boys night out. I think it could've done with a better villain perhaps one that didn't get his hands dirty",8,3,10,5 October 2014
