The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Trying CPR on Kristen Steward for 2hours
",".. edward eventually gave up on her 10 minutes before the movie ended.
I won't be able to sleep in the next few days without seeing Kristen's cachectic body infront of me. Sure, they wanted to underline that she is suffering but dang it really disgusted me, also the idea to keep the baby that would kill her. Pro life or not the topic was handled very stupid here.
Why is Jacob always hanging around and warming her? Can't they stop this triangle hiccup? They are married now. Awful. Especially because the whole movie was made only because Bella couldn't keep her legs together. Everything that happened is because she wanted to smash.
She even listened to Rosalie to keep the baby although 3 movies were enough to make clear she wanted her dead anyway.
Next thing: the wedding and honeymoon took ages and did nothing to the story but to fill minutes and make young girls fantasize about crazy and expensive weddings.
Yes, I watched the movies completely out of curiosity",2,0,2,14 July 2019
Spider-Man 2," You call this a movie?
","I can't believe what I just watched.
I really enjoyed the first movie and was on to see the Sequel. But Boy was I dissapointed. Also in a Kind of rage, as the filmmaker must think the audience is completly stupid and has no common sense.I like the introduction with all the Art Kind of explaining what happened in the first part. Nice one. But thats it then.
The Movie starts out with showing Peter Parker still in love with MJ but refusing her to save her?!Anyway we have some Scenes where Peters life seemed to fall appart as he struggles with his two identities. So he has no Money, no work, goes to college but is rubbish there as well. So I ask myself, why on earth doesn't he move back to his aunti?
She is an old Lady, would surely Need help throughout day and it would save Money. More obvioues reason of course: They both lost a loved one and are sad. I mean com'on!
So they have this horrible birthday Party full of uncomfortable Scenes and cringy moments. Mary Janes appearance shook me, as she looked washed out, dull and not all the beautiful red haired angel she portrayed in the first movie.The first time I wanted to shut down the movie was that predictable Scene when Peter brings the garbage outside. HORRIBLE! The writing, the acting... someone having a camera on and filming that nonsense?
Yikes. It went like ten minutes, Peter Parker having no Expression at all and MJ talking she has now a new Lover. Peter is so shocked: OMG the Girl I turned down some month ago got a new boyfriend.Next Thing I remember is this weird Meeting in a New York loft or something where this scientist had some work done. Sounded like he has his own CERN Fusion Collider in the living room, which could blow up and destroy the city but he would have it under controll. Sounds legit. I didn't really get it why exactly he would Need that sort of exo skellet to fullfill the work of a physic scientist, but it was surely needed for the plot.Inbetween all those Scenes, Spider-Man seems to have some identity Problems which affects his superpowers. I find this is quite a good Story line! But it is very bad written. I took him like 2 hours to understand his new Powers in the first movie now it seem to go over weeks and weeks. Coming and going with his Kind of Depression he has.
I mean - i can relate to that idea! So many things Happening, not knowing which way to follow. I feel the writer should have sticked to this one Problem: identity unclear, loosing his power, new villiain in town, Spidey get a grip and fights again! Set.
But all this wishy washy love, not love in between. Couldn't they have left MJ completey out?So of course when the scientist showed his new Invention the whole Thing predictibly blows up. OMG: The surgery Scene! I found it way to brutal and horrific compared to the rest of the movie. Horrormovie like the new metal arms of the scientist grapped like 10 doctors and grossly smacked them allover the place. This Scene was completly out of place and didn't fit at all in the atmosphere.Well Octavius woke up and coulnd't handle his new powers. As a new Born villain in town he spontanuosly found a villain hideout at the docks. Some strange ripped of part from Train Station in steam punk style just wating to be housed by mad scientist. His first thoughts went to his Assistent, which he accidently killed and the next moved to: Money! So he robbed a bank at daytime and grabbed - what? To bags of Gold Coins?How did he trade them coins? And how on earth could he order himself new devices and stuff for a new Fusion collider in his waterflooded hidy-hole? That part of the Story was so stupid. Someone acutally wrote that down and someone else acutally said: sure, let do this!Again something with MJ and Peter. nobody acutally can decide who wants whom to kiss or not kiss. Meanwhile MJ is engaged with some Pilot or what she just seemed to have met. Which is: Her fith Guy in the whole Story:
1. Movie: Highschool Bloke, Harry Ossborne, In love with Spiderman and kisses him, in love with Peter
2. Movie: Pilot and then finally Peter... She really is some 'scarlet women'. So many guys in so Little time, how can Peter still fall for her?There was this one Scene, I don't even know where in the movie but Peter went in this burning house (de javus first movie?) and tried to save a Little Girl.
This Scene made me very angry: Just as he was he went in that completly burning building! He walked... he looked around.. EVERYTHING BURNED AROUND him!? No smoke, no... nothing. Petery alltime expressionless face didn't even Change when he somehow broke down a landing and that Girl pulled him up all by herself. So laughable and stupid directed.
The first cough came like ... 25 meteres after he left the building.So it had to came as Spidey feared: When someone knows his identity .. well MJ will be in danger. So she was. And her sreaming started again. I thought we would be spared of that this time. After that ridicolously Long Train Scene, where they've probably driven like three time through new York... I shut the movie down.I took me a while to Digest the Horrors of acting I've seen. I agree that Tobey M. was quite a fail in the casting.",1,4,11,25 February 2019
Spider-Man 3," One Hero Three Villains... is a bit too much.
","I really wished for the spiderman franchise and the fans to have at least one decent movie to got with. But it's just not meant to be...After the horrible ending from the second part, where MJ left her own wedding for Peter I was really nosy to find out if they eventually made it together.
I certainly looked like it in the first 5 minutes of the Film. I wasn't sure at first in which way the plot will go as the they introduced some escaped prisoner who by accident fell into a science testing sandhole (!?) just right out of NY or the meteorite who hit the earth coincidently next to Peters moped.MJ and Peters Love wasn't that strong it seemed as MJ annoyingly, as she always is, now gets jealous about Spider-Mans popularity. I mean she really wasn't that much of a bummer when she stood on the stage... I wonder what she actually expects from the world? Spider-Man saves lives everyday in NY for GS and she ... well... MJ portrays such a weak, helpless character. The movie came out 2007 when women are strong and independent, but her role throws that topic back into 1960! OK I would have been angry too, if on stage my boyfriend would kiss (french!) another women. Just for the photos. I mean she was in a relationship, too. Why on earth should they even kiss when he gets to be citizen of honor?I ask myself why Peter never got around to take the cachectic daughter from his landlord? She is all over him, nice, simple and really wants him. There would have been one plot less to answer and we would be spared out at last with MJs never-ending screaming. I think they might have even recorded her screams and played a loop all over the actions scenes.. horrible.They also managed to solve Uncle Bens death after 3 Movies. Amazing, great they finally got all the clues together. I admit, I already was satisfied with uncle Bens Death Scene and there was no mistery to be seen for me. But they needed a plot to make Spidey angry so they introduced another criminal. The scene was actually so stupid: I mean this Flint had like the same T-Shirt on when uncle Ben was killed and three years later when he became Mr. Sand? Was there not enough money to give him a second shirt?
I have to really, really criticize that stupid fighting scene between the houses. Green Goblin jr. vs. Spidey. It was an endless fight, and looked SO BAD edited. They improved with the CGI so much in the last 2 films, but here it seemed, they've let the intern finish the scene. Even when Spidey eventually got the Goblin, he tried once for CPR... gave up and they tried to reanimate him in hospital which surely took over 20 minutes to get there. In that case he would have been dead for sure. I already felt, the filmmakers think the audience is completely stupid and has no common sense.I hoped for there main plot, when Spidey is possessed by venom! Amazing. I loved the transformation and the minutes he enjoyed his new life. Until: He looked in the mirror, full of rage... and flipped his streak of hair over his eyes. This was when he became Emo. But in such a bad way, I could Imagine his missed this phase out when he was 16...
Tobey Maguire doesn't have much expressions in the first place right, but here he lost it all. I liked it though, how he turned all his friends down. That was like a bit of acting, that suited Tobey. I actually enjoyed it how he blowed away MJ with the blond girl. But of course, Peter fought this new force in him. Which was a shame, as this plot ended to quickly in my opinion. They should have left it with this one! The sandman, the goblins revenge could have been completely left out.But as the movie lacked with a good story they had cram in that other villain stuff to fill the movie. But it was to much. As as standalone Film I wished they would have explained more about that meteorite and venom. The name venom never fall actually,.. where he comes from or what he was up to anyway.Inbetween all those complications MJ decided to try to go back to Harry. Comon MJ!? You had so many guys and chances already.. switching her love and heart like I switch my underwear made her an unlikeable person. How could Peter still fall for her? This Lovestory is complete joke. I like a good and healthy love story in super hero movies. But honestly, the times when the loved, helpless Girl gets in trouble were over already in the first movie. They continued this horror however.My favorite character in the movie was Harry Osborne. He did his job so good. Being confused, back in love with MJ, even showed he was happing not remembering his past. That was some solid and great acting. Thanks Franco! My 2 stars got to you.The way Harry died.. I didn't like it. He hated spiderman for 1 3/4 of a movie and then he died to save him? No way. Also, he just pierced in the chest like his father? I could accept that if it in comics, but I haven't read them thoroughly.
Yet another funeral and yet another speech about life lessons from peter ended this mess. Eventually.",2,1,2,27 February 2019
Bird Box," Suicidenado
","I watched the Movies because of the memes!
Yes.
So now the Plot is told within ten minutes, but the Film is stretched into more than two hours. I waited for it to become horrifying and scary so that I won't sleep at night, as the reviews told me. But the only terrifying thing was Sandra Bullock not giving love to her, at least one one of them, children and calling them boy and girl. Of course not bonding to the children, means it is easier to let them go if they die, seems logic .. but in a world full of mystic winds that makes people kill themself, a bit of love and affection may helped them to develop.
Anyway the movies leaves us with lots of questions: most of all where the suicide storm came from and where does it go?
It seems the writer of the story made themself an easy job for creating just the middle part of a story. Shouldn't there be.. a beginning .. and an ending? Other things questioned me too:
Why was this gale of dark thoughts especially strong in the forest? Why should these birds stay next to the blind school on the trees, build up a mystic trail for others and not.. like fly alway? Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Why do the blind ones have endless food rations and resources?
In the Flashback: Why did they not use sticks or canes and a blindfold to go next door - if they are neighbors for ages they surely know the area by heart! Why take a car to the supermarket first?
I found the brutality very strong and often looked away. I had the feeling a good story doesn't need so much gruesome deaths. The hard ways of killing themself shook me a lot and woke me up between endless scenes where characters made stupid decisions and the repeatatly river montages.",5,1,3,19 January 2019
Split," Mental health problems should never entertain. A movie that brings modern psychiatric work into disrepute
","Wanted to watch the Movie as I just viewed 'Glass' the other day, did not know it was a Triology.
First the movie itself: Multiple Personalities always sound fascinating - why not make a(nother) movie out of it. The Plot was quite clear within minutes into the film. It went on and on... like those teenager movies where they go camping in a haunted forest and one after another vanishes.
James McAvoy showed a superb performance with him changing personalities every other minute. He was the whole movie! He carried everything. The Girls and the Psychologists where forgettable.
Kidnapping movie, showing sexualized teenagers are stupid. Only Casey, who was abused herself, had some special abilities. And this must the real plot of the whole movie:
The ones who have suffered gain strength out it and develop some new powers. Casey staying calm and clever, Kevin becoming some super cross fit guy without training and knowing how. Mr. Dunn - nearly getting drowned by school bullying and now has visions what people are up to at the moment.
I don´t know if I can go with that... needing a Trauma to become especially powerful? Obviously here even getting criminal.
I work in psychiatric hospital for children on a closed ward .. and I am more then sure they would rather be normal, renounce the superpower and have not been traumatized???!
Anyway with movies like this, where someone with a mental illness(rare or not) does criminal things, brings modern psychiatric work into disrepute. In 2016 it should not entertain, it should educate that mental illness is as normal as breaking you leg and no one should be scared of them. I also urge the director, for gods sake, to even research those illnesses first and not bring in false information about DID. Shyamalan took a disease and invited it completely new, for dramatic reasons and in the end it just makes people with mental health problems look dangerous, evil and possibly criminal. Bad job!
Another plot whole that made me rage:
Cayses Story was shown with rape flashbacks all the movie along. How on earth could she stay calm through the whole film, being again in situation that might end up rape? Just at the end she showed some panic attack, which I believed her. I feel she, as a character, was really bad written.",1,0,7,28 January 2019
Spider-Man," Entertaining for 2002
","I never had the Chance to watch the whole movie. Just bits of it, now Netflix gave me the Chance and I sat it out.I really enjoyed the Film although I knew the whole Plot.
Of course there were gaping holes in the plot, the acting was shallow the conversation predictable and the graphics made me feel like I watch cut Scenes from a Videogame.Still I liked the Idea and the first half was very good and promising. Until MJ got in Trouble the umpteenthed time and we had to endure Kirstens vocal skills. The time she was on Screen was more a Screamtime than a Screentime. As a role MJ portrayed such a dependent, weak and stupid women it made me angry.
Her Friendship and so called 'love' also made me doubt her character. First she was with this High School Bully an inlove. Clearly showing she doesn't want to be with him but seemed to weak to end it all. Then Harry Ossborne had a go with her. Meanwhile she falls in love with Spidermann, kisses him even!
Peter Parkers love for her was so dramatically all over the film, an how he could never reach her, she would be to perfect for him, got friendzoned like five times and still worships her. Having said that, the end pained me so much a brainfreeze kicked in although I haven't eaten Ice Cream for months.
On Norman Ossbornes Funeral MJ confesses her love and he turned her down? What utter nonsense.I liked William Dafoe in his role as the Green Goblin. His Gollumlike Split Action was really well done, he has some really amazing skills for portraying mad People. Sure his Mask and the suit looked out of Fashion... but I rather have real People and real suits instead of all the CGI when superheroes are animated from toe to head. Lets stay with the suits: how come the goblin fires his pumpkin bombs everyones reduced to ashes but Spidy, getting thrown one full in the face, he only gets a scratch?All in all, Spider-Man is a classic. Also with stonefaced Tobey Meguire, it shouldn't be missed out. Most classic of all that this movies has so many up to date memes in it, please give it go!",4,0,0,26 February 2019
The Fast and the Furious," Two stars for this comedy!
","It made me laugh so often. I really wanted to get into this Franchise and it got me good: at laughing.
There was no real Story, no acting nothing but fast cars and hot 90's Babes.
When Sean was introduced into the gang there where females who wanted to be males. The only racing Girl of course had a barby colored car.
It made me cringe everytime they switched from on Driver to another everytime trying to get out a cool setence like: you're next. I´'ll Show you what I got. Eat my dust, Boy.
I can only guess they financed all those expensive cars and stuff because of the product Placement.
Als the animations made us snort into our drínks when they hit the red button on the driving wheel. Everyone always got smashed in their seats but so badly I was reminded of the early star trek series when the actors shook themselves instead of the camera when they where hit by a Meteor shower.
The safety precautions came quite short in the movie. I haven't seen any seatbelts, or safety clothing. Even when they crashed, nobody got hurt.I had to admitt It often looked like, it's ok to take risks in driving. Nothing will hapen, no one gets hurt or arrested. Women will always offer themselves willingly, even if your are mean and ugly. There is always Money to build new cars. Have I mentioned that women will always offers themselves willingly?",2,1,5,18 April 2019
Twilight," Can't believe I liked this
","... and I even cannot answer why I would like this Piece of bad acted rat fart of a movie. This movie is one of the best addapted-to-the-book movie I have ever seen and I hate that fact. They put in alot of Detail to scenery, clothes, used even same sentences as in the book and the making of the sets. It was exactly like I imagined things in the book. The biggest downer in this movie, and this is quite escentiell to a movie: are the actors!Kristen Stewart.I mean, I really hate bella in the books. She really has some Boderline issues and the Book Belly has no Qualities, no skills, no Humor, no personality whatsoever. By choosen Kristen for this Piece of acting wasn't to bad then.Robert Pattinson.I liked him much as Cedric, I am sure under better directing and make up he may have been a pretty cool Edward. I really hated his make-up, it was so badly done. Just remember Interview with the Vampire: the Vampire chronicles. They looked dead serious, dangerous and hot at the same time! Also his Chesthair as a 17 year old is downturn for me.Charlie is portrayed best I'd say. Billy Burke did his best to save a bit of the movie.",6,2,3,14 November 2019
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Wanting to get to know the hype
","I watched the movies 10 years after release wanting to know the hype. The first one got me ok... but this one: big oof.
Bella and edward broke up, which we all have seen coming. This scene seemed so never ending?! Kristen always exhales very loud instead of forming sentences and also in the 2nd movie refuses to look someone in the eyes while talking.
It was such a childish fake depression I mean common how long have the been together? 3 or 4 months? They only kissed like two times. Her first boyfriend and his .. surely he must have had lots of girls in his hundred years of living.
Anyway Bella filled her hole in the heart with, of course, some other creature. What is it with this town that two rivaling folks live there and Bella falls in love with the youngest of both.
To me, Bella got some real borderline issues.
So we get to see lots of young men half naked in short jeans. Always.. also in Italy when edward is about to glitter on the market place: he's got his pants so low I am sure he had to shave his pubic hair to wear jeans like that. Had to look away.
The scene that really made me belief this is a parody: when the sister looks into the future and Bella and Edward run slowmo through the forest. No way someone gave his OK to put the scene into the movie!",4,1,2,14 July 2019
The Blind Side," I am sorry for the real Michael Oher
","... but the Real Leigh Ann Tuohy must be excited to be portrayed by Sandra Bullock. I only just found out Sandra won an Oscar for this Perfomance. IMO that gives the Oscar Award a complete different value: Sandra Bullock played her role just like any other before! There was really nothing new, Special or extraordinary. Please think of Leonardo DiCaprio, it took him Ages to win an Oscar and he did so many different roles with a much wider Performance.Anyway, as a European this movie shocked me to be honest.
The movie started so nice, everyone was nice, everything turned out good, no arguements fell, no agression, no doubts or rethinking of decisions. I waited the whole movie to the Point where the Boy hits someone, steals or something dramatic would happen. It just didn't. Well yeah, when he went back in his Hood - this was quite realisitc. More of this needed to happen, to make this movie into something that has to do with real human Feelings.This movies had 2 sides: Fantasy and reality.
The Fantasy side was obviously the White Family, living the dream, picking up a stray black Boy from the street, try to adopt him, making him into whatever they think is good for him without asking. Leigh Ann was a saint, she was beautiful and had perfect Kids. She managed everything so stepford wifish, it was creepy.
The Reality side was Michael. I work with drug addicted children who already have lived on the streets. How they descibed his life, losing his home, brother and mother and father, everything that happened to him, beeing in High School but not able to read and write correctly - yes! That is absolutly possible and happens often. Could have been a White Kid also.
Non realitstic however was his behaviour. Having experienced so much pain, loss and bonding issues this kid is unlikely to just be Kind and nice.Now let me rant: Oh Gosh! What was it with this stupid Thing about his intelligence: he has no IQ but his skills in protecting are at 95% - lets make him a Football Player. What?
Also, the husband? Please - he owns Tacco Bell, KFC and I dunno what, brings home millions of Money but the wife just decides everything. This men has no rights whatsover in this Family. I feels it is all about Leigh Ann and showing how good she is. It really made me cringe so often. I just could not enjoy this cool Story made so stereotypically.
The worst really was one of the last Scenes. Leigh Ann read out some newspaper Storys about missing children or a child beeing killed on the streets. She was greatful to god that is wasn't her child, she smiled and thanked god.
Lord! It still was someones child! That left me really angry when the cedits rolled.",1,0,0,15 November 2019
Fantastic Four," did my laundry while watching the movie
","I love the marvel series and every attempt to make new movies and introducing new superheroes into our world. I never read any Comics, so my critics go to this film as a standalone.I found that I guessed the plot of this within the first 5minutes of the movie. But the holes were so deep, I tried to fold my Pants with a sock, I was so confused.
I admit to have started grining when I saw Cole from Charmed as the supposed villain in the movie. He already played highly evil characters before, so I though he fitted very well. But admittedly I wished him a bit more evil as in my opinion he did not deserve a strong Name like Dr. Doom.
Right after Doom they introduced Storm as the female main character. I think they wanted to make her intelligent and she was some sort of scientist. But to me she seemed the shallow Assistent to Doom who would fall for him, as he was his Boss and had lots of power and Money.I don´t even know how but in the next 3 minutes they already been up in space! Of course today, there is no Need for a Special Training to go into space. That was quite to fast! Also this predictible Scene from Storm: Oh look, we got some super tight and stretchy suits now which I will present to the audience with my perfect Body so everyone overlooks my lack of acting.
Ben the big Bloke was all over with his love to his wife and everyone new, you could relay on this guy. Well up in the air some sort of wild storm hit the Crew. They Kind of misscalculated the time it will appear, but they never explained why an how. Ben later just said, this is nature. Deal with it.Magicly they all survived and been transported to some expensive private Hospital, thanks Mr. Doom!
They all been in quarantine, as knowbody yet knew if they were.. infectious?
In the Marvel University quarantine obviously means, you can hang out with each other outside on the balcony, be in the Cafeteria or even go to a snowboardtrip with your Nurse??? Stupidest Thing I've ever heard.
When the Nurse entered the room of a patient she didn't even weare gloves or a protective mouth cover.Anyway here they discovered their new powers. OMG the Scene with Reed, sliding his Hand trough the gap of the door! I had to cover my eyes, it was to painfull to watch this mess of CGI Animation.Well they discovered Ben had gone so they followed him back to NY. The doctors or what obvioulsy lifted quarantine as they .. well just left allthough theire powers have just emerged and nobody knows what they are?!Ben made to NY with the Train? From top of some mountains right into the City he phoned his wife from the Corner in front of his house, to call her down and meet her. At the window you could see her waiting in a negligee. Well she just went down on the streets with only her negligee! Right on the streets with everyone watching. When she saw Ben she ran away, obviously scared. Can't believe anyone gave their OK to direct this ridiculous Scene.The Trio heard Ben would be at the End of the Bridge... which could be any Bridge and any End. But they tried to meet up. Ben meanwhile had Trouble to addept to his new Looks, which he did quite well. He portrayed the confusion and addepting excellent.
Ben got into a huddle with someone who was about to commit suicide. And he Kind of saved him but also caused a huge Crash with like tweenty others who surely got injured. The fantastic Trio was also in the traffic jam and of course knew.. this had to ben? Why would they guess that. They haven't even seen him fully transformed.
This Scene though: There was a hold up and People watching the chaos. Reed suggested that Storm must use her invisibilty to get in front of the line. First of all: and to do what? She undressed infront of all the People, predictibly switching between visibillity and invisibility. I don*t know if we should have laughed or whistled.. I was just embarassed how flat this scene was made. When she eventually got infront of the line... she couldn't do anything and Reed and Johny also were just in front. WHAT WAS THE POINT? Was it really that obvious, give Jessica a Chance to Show off?
As this wasn't enough Ben's wife turned up (How did she know he was there? How could she come through the traffic?) and left her ring on the ground. It was very sad.. and confusing.
So it seemed they needed to find out about theire powers. Best place was Reeds Science lab in a huge loft on a top Building in NY. Stuffed with loads of devices, Equipment and medical Hardware. I heard him saying he was broke and had no Money...?! The Filmmakers really think the audience is stupid.The Tests they made also were so laughable and completly senseless!What Kind of metal holds the temperature of the sun? If he was Close so become a supernova.. why wasn't the building and City around already been smushed into ashes? How can they x-ray or what Bens Skin and organs without shielding themselves. Also this is supposed to be an unknown structure and material.
I had no Idea what Kind of mirror or glass this was when they figured out Storm really was invisible. Why did he have to look through magnifying glass to see, if she really was invisible? Also there was this forced lovething between them. I could never have seen them as a couple, there was no chemistry whatsoever. Only Storm looking hot and Reed was a geek. The didn't fit at all. They put in a horrible Montage of everyone experimenting with theire new abilities - but they made it into a 1990 version. Until that I would have enjoyed the movie if was 9 years old.In all between Van Doom became Dr. Doom. His Transformation took Ages to complete, also nothing really happened.The following Storyline included mainly the four bickering over each other, Johny living his new life and Ben separates from the Group while Storm and Reed seem to fall for each other again. The whole city seemed to celebrate the FF although really they only reapired the damage they have caused themselves. And the all loyal true husband how loved debby so much.. found a new Girl in a bar. Just as plain as that.Of course there had to come the fight against Doom were all of the four eventually unite and fight as a Team. They just figured it out within the last 5 minutes. There was like on Scene where I found a bit of acting from Alba. When she had to hold the storm of fire! I believed her. Although I wondered : At first Storm had to repell the fist of doom and she cried out, she couldn't hold it longer. Someone else took over. The Endscene of the fight however included her Holding against a supernova. And she did alright with that.So now let me tell you about the end where I shoutet out loud: The four celebratet on a boat (Why didn't it sink with Ben transformed into the the Thing?) and there was the Blind one, Alicia. And Ben already seemed completly in love and forgotten his wife Debby which he mentioned like ten times in the moviè? That made me really angry at the end.. as if marriage and love was just something you Switch like your underwear. No great values they trying to teach us in the film.",3,2,6,1 March 2019
