Gremlins," why on eath does this movie have a 7.2?
","This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Awkwardly funny sometimes? I guess, but I honestly thought it was a spoof movie. Maybe if you are an old grandpa you'll enjoy this. This was painful to watch at the nursing home where I volunteer and I would not recommend it whatsoever.",2,2,15,27 December 2017
Orphan," One of my favourite movies!
","I absolutely love this movie! Fantastic acting and amazing story line. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Very very well done, I recommend this movie to all my friends. It is very interesting movie/thriller, and the young girl does a great job. It is actually creepy!",10,0,0,10 November 2017
