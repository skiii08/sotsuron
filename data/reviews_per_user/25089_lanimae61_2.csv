Skyfall," Thrills, Spills, Car Chases and twists. Bond Times 10
","This film had much to live up the. the hype was similar to that of the awful Quantum Of Solace which frankly made no sense at all. Daniel Craig is back as the bad and gritty Bond sans gadgets. No car cameos for the sole purpose of product placement, like that of the weak as water Z3 of Goldeneye, or the split second Z8 from The World is not Enough, are gone. The action start right from the outset with that much lauded bike chase across the rooftops of Istanbul. We meet the new Q. This installment explains that Q stands for Quartermaster for those of us who haven't read the books. A computer hard drive is stolen with a list of agents on it. It's not a new theme by any means but this movie has rebooted the series for those of us who hated the Quantum of Solace. Bond recovers from serious injuries to return to MI6 to help get the hard drive back. Q gives Bond a Walther PPK with high-tech personal coding and a tracking device but no other goodies. In a way it gives us a Bond from the 60's who got by on guile alone. The score cleverly works in some familiar tunes from Bond movies gone by but the star of the Skyfall has to be the DB5 which is exchanged when 007 feels the M's XJ stands out too much in a crowd. The scenery is stunning both in Asia and Scotland as well as the usual spots in London.A slightly deranged ex-agent (Silva) escapes custody to rampage against the machine he claims created him. MI6 is under attack and Bond and M are personally targeted. We find out that Bond comes from a family who once lived a remote existence in a Scottish highlands house called SkyFall. I've revealed there will be a spoiler here so if you don't want to know what happens to M then STOP READING NOW:The crescendo is reached when Bond, M and the faithful Scottish caretaker are hold up in Skyfall which is besieged by Silva and friends. Explosions and gunfire ensues culminating the the fatal shooting of Judy Dench's long running character and MI6 director, M. The film closes with Bond accepting orders from Ralph Feinnes, the limp and rather foppish M replacement.Skyfall was a visual feast with not a single complaint but I'm not sure a Gen-Y Q and a limp fop M will quite fill the bill for future Bond outings. Daniel Craig has not confirmed that he'll be back.Stay tuned.....Nearing the",9,2,9,24 November 2012
Quantum of Solace," Not another Bond film... SADLY!
","I love my bond. I've spent many hours watching and re-watching every outing by 007. We purposely watched only the trailers for the new movie, no reviews. Why? We didn't want to spoil the surprise. We booked out Gold Class at Greater Union in Sydney George St, got there early to avoid the rush, but the theatre was nowhere nearly empty! Imagine my shock. After ordering the champs to be brought in halfway through, we made our way in. For the next 2 hours, the most interesting thing was the steward bringing our champagne and nibbles. Poor Cubby Broccoli would be spinning in his grave like a Christmas turkey of he knew what a 'Barry Crocker' the studio was going to try and pass off as the sequel to Casino Royale. I love Daniel Craig as Bond and Dame Judy is my hero, but the five year old who wrote this story needs a spanking. There is more of that silly running/jumping/leaping and other similarly improbable moves that even the fittest superhero would have had trouble with. It worked in Casino Royale but is done, done, done to death. Unlike Casino Royale, poor 'Q' has been given his notice and is sunning himself in Greece, because he certainly didn't work on the DB, or the watch, or belt or any other Bond-like gadget. No lasers or guns under the bonnet, no oil in the boot. Just some poor sap running about and punching/shooting and otherwise killing people. The committee (who never met) that consulted with the five year old to write the words and story line had obviously never seen another Bond film, not even the previous one. This movie was all over the place like a mad womans' breakfast. Someone got a whole bunch of stuntmen together and filmed them beating each other to a pulp, then got another man to find an excuse to blow up a god-awful alleged hotel in the middle of the desert. Oh by the way, just to make sure that it does fly apart, the seamlessly work into the story that it runs on fuel cells. Every room has a large cylinder in the corner with large friendly letters saying 'hydrogen' plastered across them. It's just as well they all faced the camera or we would never have guessed that some kind of gun fight was about to ensue, and moreover, that the place was about to become visible from space as an appropriately huge explosion tore through the building blowing concrete to smithereens. Luckily it missed bond, phew! Even better, it only put a bit of a hole in his particular room instead of launching it into orbit around Jupiter. And as if by chance, the hole was just big enough for two people scramble out, would you believe it? But not onto a ledge, no no no, down the rubble, which had thoughtfully landed in a big pile right outside the hole so they could caper down it and on to the sand and through the desert to safety. Just as well they weren't thirsty or die of the injuries that killed every other living being in a 200 kilometre radius. I'm sorry but this un-007-like story was bad and almost impossible to follow, perhaps an extra few bottles of champs would have helped. It bore almost no resemblance at all to a bond film but instead was a series of cutting-room-floor actions scenes cobbled together by a blind man and foisted off onto us as a carefully considered 007 feature film. The actors tried their best, but bless them, the words 'silk purse' and 'sows ear' come to mind. I DO like an action flick, and there was certainly action, but I don't think it was all filmed for this picture. I think some clever clogs in Hollywood had a little too much blow when stapled the scenes together, because I don't think he got them in the right order or in the right movie. Since our most entertaining thing about the evening was trying to find the nibbles in the dark, I would wait until the DVD comes to your local Blockbuster and goes to weekly, get 5 friends to chip in and you'll have value for money. As long, of course, as you have a six pack of champs, two bottles of voddie an endless-tray of nibbles and a whole bunch patience. The only reason we gave the film 3 was the Daniel was partially clad, but not, in our opinion, for anywhere near long enough to get the extra points. This movie was NOT a Bond film, it was its' poor mongrel cousin.We wait in anticipation for the next instalment and hope this crew got the chop before the whole franchise is deader than a dingo's donger!",3,4,6,1 December 2008
