Requiem for a Dream," Horribly disturbing, dreadfully brutal... amazing performances
","This movie has really disturbed me. I just watched it last night and I woke up at 3:30 finding it difficult to fall back asleep; I could not get certain shocking scenes out of my mind.The performances by Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly were absolutely incredible. I thought that the scenes between Burstyn and Leto were done particularly well, as it would have been easy to fall into some mother/son cheesiness. That did not happen. It was refreshing to see Wayans and Leto deliver top notch performances in challenging roles.This movie is the most disturbing and brutal film I have ever seen. I can't say that I liked it or didn't like it, it just was. But I can say that the writing, cinematography and acting were excellent. So, would I recommend it? Not without the caveat that the viewer will be turned inside out by this intense portrayal of human desperation.",10,0,1,11 July 2002
Princess Mononoke," One of my favorite films
","I have been meaning to see this movie again for a while. It is one of the most eloquent, poetic, gut-wrenching movie I have ever seen. Period.It is tale of the inherent struggle between man and earth, good and evil.It spoke about the SOUL of nature that it is in all things and what happens when all that is evil and cancerous and greedy takes over that amazing LIFE that is inside everything that breathes, grows, and dies.Truly an amazing movie that is seriously one of the best. I am wondering why I don't own it yet.",10,0,1,17 June 2002
