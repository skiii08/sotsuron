The Ring," I liked it, damn it!
","I thought The Ring was really scary and a great movie.  I keep seeing all this criticism being pushed on it because of the original Japanese film, but without this version, there's tons of us that would never have seen the story at all.  I wouldn't know if the original is better or not.  But what I do know is that Naomi Watts rocked and I was seriously scared and uncomfortable throughout the film.  Isn't that what a thriller or horror film is supposed to accomplish?My input:  See it and enjoy it instead of turning it into an analysis session.",9,0,0,18 October 2002
