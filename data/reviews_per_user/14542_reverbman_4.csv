The Ring," overrated
","The scariest thing about this film is that it stole two hours of my life! It is well filmed and directed, with pretty good special effects. I watched it on a laptop DVD with headphones and the sound was quite impressive. Still, the whole story hardly made any sense at all. Without going too much into spoilers, Where did she come from? Why was she so bad? What was her motivation? What the hell was with the fly? The horses? The list goes on and on...I guess it was worth watching just to look at Naomi Watts. Made me want to watch 'Mulholland Drive' again. The only thing good about this film is you can play tricks on your friends after watching it, like calling their cell phone and whispering 'seven days....' What fun.If you want to see a GOOD scary movie rent Carpenter's 'The Thing', 'The Exorcist' or 'The Evil Dead'.",Null,0,1,15 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A work of art
","I really don't think LOTR could be called the greatest movie of all time, but certainly the greatest fantasy movie. Is it better than Star Wars? I don't know, it's hard to compare a space opera to a pure fantasy. I do know that Lucas was 'heavily influenced' by LOTR. I won't say he stole from it, but just look at the similarities..I am a fan of the trilogy. I read it first in the 8th grade, then in my twenties, then again last year because I knew Peter Jackson was making it into a series of films. I had forgotten a lot, (I'm 40 now) and reading it this last time was the most enjoyable of all. LOTR is truly an epic, grand tale. I know a lot of people find the books boring in parts. Yes, Tolkien could spend ten pages just describing a forest, but it really makes you feel like you are there. People must have the attention span of gnats nowadays.LOTR-THE FILM is definitely not boring. It is an action film. If you want the full backstory and character development, read the book, it has plenty. I actually like the slow parts in the book, they break up the chase\battlescenes. A lot of people have complained that the movie is just chase\battle\pause, over and over. This is a story about a perilous quest, what do you expect? And it is a LONG quest, Frodo has a lot further to go at the end of this film. If you haven't read the books, believe me, it just gets better! The film has quite a few scary images, but LOTR is not a children's book, it's a serious story about the corruption of power, filled with horror, war and despair but with an ultimately uplifting ending.
**possible spoiler ahead ***I loved everything about the movie, with the exception of the giant crumbling staircase sequence in Moria. That wasn't in the book and just seemed like something out of an Indiana Jones flick. Other than that, Jackson's vision of Middle Earth was pretty much exactly like what I pictured in my mind. And I didn't miss Tom Bombadil a bit. I've seen it twice now and enjoyed it just as much on the repeat viewing. Acting, special effects, costume design, cinematography, and especially sound are all top notch. Jackson and crew truly did Tolkien's work justice, and accomplished what many thought to be an impossible task. I'll be buying the DVD for sure.I can't wait for 'The Two Towers'. It'll be interesting to see how they bring the Ents to life.",Null,0,0,12 February 2002
Mulholland Drive," One of Lynch's best
","David Lynch films, like free jazz, are definitely an acquired taste. Some people will never develop a taste for these types of art, but that's cool. I happen to really like most of what Lynch does, it's different and not the same old Hollywood crap. So what if some if it I still 'don't get'. The mesmerizing images, sounds, and music in this film are wonderful, as is the acting by the two female leads.It did take me two viewings to (sort of) figure out what the story was. I was pretty chapped when I discovered the DVD has no chapters, forcing you to watch the film in its entirety! That Lynch, what a joker! I decided to watch it a second time two days later, after I had a while to think about it. Many things became clear on the second time around. I think its best not to try to over-analyze the first half, as I suspect Lynch himself may not be able to explain what it all means!***POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***Someone on this site already explained the basic story pretty well, it's about the sad demise of struggling actress Diane Selwyn, who is obsessed with another actress named Camilla Rhodes. The story up to where the blue box is opened is a dream, and after that is 'real life'. On the initial viewing, the hard part is determining which scenes are Diane's dream, which are fantasies, and which are real. There are little clues in there, you just have to go back and find them. For instance, near the end, when Diane's ex-roommate comes over to pick up her stuff, she takes the black ashtray off the coffee table. She leaves, and then right after that, when Diane and Camilla have their encounter on the couch, the camera pans over and we see the ashtray is on the table, showing that the encounter is a fantasy.Another very confusing thing is having two different actresses play Camilla Rhodes. The girl playing Camilla in the dream is not the real Camilla(Rita). Weird. I guess Lynch did this because in a dream, anything can happen, even people changing identities.Don't ask me what the creepy, happy old couple are all about, I haven't a clue on that one!Recommended if you like puzzles, film noir, and films that you have to think about, rather than standard Hollywood cookie cutter product.

Evil Dead II," Groovy!
","EDII is a wacked out horror-comedy, and definitely not for all tastes. In fact, the first time I saw it many years ago, I thought it was stupid. I was into 'serious' horror films at the time and didn't appreciate the humor in it. It's almost a satire of the horror genre, even of the original Evil Dead. Years later I was able to appreciate it for what it is. If you approach it with this in mind, it's a scream of a good time. The original Evil Dead film was scarier, but the only humor in it was unintentional, ie: incredibly bad acting, super cheesy FX. In EDII, we get better acting and better FX, still cheesy but they fit the tone of the film. The gore is so over the top it's hilarious!What really makes the film is Sam Raimi's camera work and Bruce Campbell's crazed acting and brilliant physical comedy. The bit with the evil hand is just classic.Folks who gripe about plot holes and the like: loosen up, it's just a cheesy horror movie. You're taking it way too seriously. It's really a marvelous piece of work for a relatively low budget film, and there's a reason why it's earned such a cult following and is held in such high esteem by many in the business: it's full of creativity.There's been a lot of controversy over the story not matching up with the first film. Here's my take on it: It's not really a sequel. Ash didn't go back to the cabin. The events at the first of EDII are a recap of what happened in the first ED film, for people who didn't see it, but EDII is meant to stand on it's own. Army of Darkness is the sequel to EDII, so there are really only two films in the 'series', not three. I think the original Evil Dead is just a 'demo' if you will, of what Raimi really had in mind. Personally, I'm glad he increased the humor and decreased the hard core gore a bit, it makes it more entertaining. The last time I tried to watch the original Evil Dead, I could barely finish it, it was so bad. Of the three Evil Dead films, this one is hands down my favorite.The DVD of this is great, especially the commentary, one of the best I've heard. Buy it.",Null,0,0,9 October 2001
