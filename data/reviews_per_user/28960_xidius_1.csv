The Incredible Hulk," Edward Norton = Win.
","This movie was amazing. It was everything I had hoped 2003's 'Hulk' had been, and more. It was gritty, true to the characters, and action-packed.The special effects were mind-blowing, the actors were perfect, and the story was great.Even my mother, who doesn't even watch super-hero movies (doesn't generally care for the genre) was blown away by it.A big thanks to Edward Norton for pressing the studios to do this movie the right way.Were he not involved, I don't see this movie being half as enjoyable.",10,2,7,13 June 2008
